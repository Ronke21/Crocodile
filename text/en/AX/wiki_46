<text>Gaëtan Dugas (; February 20, 1953 – March 30, 1984) was a Canadian flight attendant whose role in the early years of the AIDS epidemic attracted considerable attention. Initially identified as a central figure labeled &quot;Patient Zero&quot;, Dugas faced allegations of being a primary source of HIV transmission to the United States. This narrative, popularized notably by Randy Shilts&#x27; 1987 book &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;, has been refuted through subsequent scientific scrutiny and historical re-evaluation. Dugas&#x27; story highlights the perils of misinformation and the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS in the 1980s. Despite facing criticism in popular discourse, subsequent studies have provided a more nuanced understanding of Dugas&#x27; impact on the epidemic, emphasizing the importance of accuracy and empathy in public health narratives.

Dugas worked as a flight attendant for Air Canada and died in Quebec City in March 1984 as a result of kidney failure caused by AIDS-related infections. In March 1984, a study tracked Dugas, along with other gay and bisexual men, to indicate his role in a particular cluster of 40 AIDS cases in the United States. He was named &quot;Patient O&quot; with &quot;O&quot; standing for &quot;Out-of-California&quot;. &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; used the term &quot;Patient Zero&quot; and put significant focus on Dugas, with media reports expanding his role in the epidemic further. A 2016 study confirmed that Dugas did not bring HIV to the United States, and he was not Patient Zero, via genetic analysis of stored blood samples, supported by historical detective work.

==1984 cluster study==

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study published in &quot;The American Journal of Medicine&quot; in 1984 titled &quot;Cluster of Cases of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome&quot; examined the sexual contacts of gay men infected with AIDS to determine if their histories were consistent with the hypothesis that AIDS was caused by an infectious agent. A graph included with the paper traced the sequence of infection among 40 men and labelled one of the nodes as &quot;Patient 0&quot; (with other nodes including the place of residence and a number indicating the sequence in which they developed AIDS symptoms, such as &quot;NY 14&quot;). The paper later stated:
The researchers later stated they had originally intended to designate Dugas as &quot;Patient O&quot;, with &quot;O&quot; standing for &quot;Out-of-California&quot; but at some point it was changed to a &quot;0&quot;.

==&quot;Patient Zero&quot; designation==
Dugas is featured prominently in Randy Shilts&#x27; 1987 book &quot;And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic&quot; (1987), which documents the outbreak of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. Shilts refers to Dugas as &quot;Patient Zero&quot; and portrays him as having almost sociopathic behaviour by allegedly intentionally infecting, or at least recklessly endangering, others with the virus. Dugas is described as being a charming, handsome sexual athlete who, according to his own estimation, averaged hundreds of sex partners per year. He claimed to have had over 2,500 sexual partners across North America since becoming sexually active in 1972. In David France&#x27;s 2016 book &quot;How to Survive a Plague&quot;, Shilts&#x27; editor expressed his regret for having &quot;made a conscious decision to vilify Dugas in the book and publicity campaign in order to spur sales.&quot;

==Re-examination==

A number of authorities have since voiced reservations about the implications of the CDC&#x27;s Patient Zero study and characterizations of Dugas as being responsible for bringing HIV to cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. In the Patient Zero study, the average length of time between sexual contact and the onset of symptoms was months. While Shilts&#x27; book does not make such an allegation, the rumour that Dugas was the principal disseminator of the virus became widespread. In 1988, Andrew R. Moss published an opposing view in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;.

In 2016, a group of researchers led by evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey conducted a genetic study that looked at blood samples taken from gay and bisexual men in 1978 and 1979 as part of a hepatitis B study, and based on the results of the data, concluded that Dugas was not the source of the virus in the United States. &quot;On the family tree of the virus, Dugas fell in the middle, not at the beginning.&quot; &quot;Beliefs about Patient Zero,&quot; Worobey concludes, &quot;are unsupported by scientific data.&quot; Worobey&#x27;s paper, published in &quot;Nature&quot; in October 2016, finds &quot;neither biological nor historical evidence that he was the primary case in the United States or for subtype B as a whole.&quot; While Dugas was not the source of HIV infection in the U.S., he was the source of infection for a large number of men, by his own admission. 

A study by historian Richard McKay of Cambridge and others identified several causes for the Patient Zero myth. During early CDC analysis of cases in California, patient 057 (Dugas) was nicknamed patient &quot;O&quot; for &quot;Out-of-California&quot;, but this was interpreted by others as Patient Zero. Dugas was particularly helpful in tracing his network of partners, providing names and addresses for many of them, which was further expanded because others remembered his distinctive name. Although many of the patients analysed reported in excess of 1,000 sexual partners, most remembered &quot;only a handful&quot; of names, making their contacts to other cases more difficult to trace. Richard McKay later extended this study into a book, &quot;Patient Zero and the Making of the AIDS Epidemic&quot;. This book also contains the most definitive biography of Dugas&#x27; life, constructed through numerous interviews with friends, family, and lovers. Robert M. Grant, an AIDS researcher at the University of California, has stated: &quot;No one wants to be the Patient Zero of their village. But this may be helpful because it says, &#x27;Just because you are the first to be diagnosed doesn&#x27;t mean you started the epidemic.&#x27;&quot;

Two films, John Greyson&#x27;s musical comedy film &quot;Zero Patience&quot; (1993) and Laurie Lynd&#x27;s documentary &quot;Killing Patient Zero&quot; (2019), have discussed the Patient Zero myth around Dugas.

<text>Cumae ( or or ; ) was the first ancient Greek colony of Magna Graecia on the mainland of Italy and was founded by settlers from Euboea in the 8th century BCE. It became a rich Roman city, the remains of which lie near the modern village of Cuma, a &quot;frazione&quot; of the &quot;comune&quot; Bacoli and Pozzuoli in the Metropolitan City of Naples, Campania, Italy. The archaeological museum of the Campi Flegrei in the Aragonese castle contains many finds from Cumae.

==History==
===Early===
The oldest archaeological finds by Emil Stevens in 1896 date to 900–850 BC and more recent excavations have revealed a Bronze Age settlement of the ‘pit-culture’ people, and later dwellings of Iron Age Italic peoples whom the Greeks referred to by the names Ausones and Opici (whose land was called Opicia).

The Greek settlement was founded in the 8th century BCE by emigrants from cities of Eretria and Chalcis in Euboea, next to an Opician settlement. The Greeks were already established at nearby Pithecusae (modern Ischia) and were led to Cumae by the joint &quot;oecists&quot; (founders): Megasthenes of Chalcis and Hippocles of Cyme.

The site chosen was on the hill and later acropolis of Monte di Cuma surrounded on one side by the sea, and on the other by particularly fertile ground on the edge of the Campanian plain. While continuing their maritime and commercial traditions, the settlers of Cumae strengthened their political and economic power by exploitation of the land and extended their territory at the expense of neighbouring peoples.

The colony thrived and in the 8th century BCE it was already strong enough to send Perieres to found Zancle in Sicily, and another group to found Tritaea in Achaea, Pausanias was told. Cuma established its dominance over almost the entire Campanian coast up to Punta Campanella over the 7th and 6th centuries BCE, gaining sway over Puteoli and Misenum.

The colony spread Greek culture in Italy and introduced a dialect of Greek, and the Euboean alphabet, a variant of which was adapted and modified by the Etruscans and then re‑adapted by the Romans and became the Latin alphabet, still used worldwide today.

According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus,

The growing power of the Cumaean Greeks led many indigenous tribes of the region to organise against them, notably the Dauni and Aurunci with the leadership of the Capuan Etruscans. This coalition was defeated by the Cumaeans in 524 BCE at the first Battle of Cumae under the direction of Aristodemus. The glorious victories of the colony increased its prestige, so much so that according to Diodorus Siculus, it was usual to associate the whole region of the Phlegraean Fields with Cumaean territory.

At this time the Roman senate sent agents to Cumae to purchase grain in anticipation of a siege of Rome. Then in 505 BCE Aristodemus led a Cumaean contingent to assist the Latin city of Aricia in defeating the Etruscan forces of Clusium (see also War between Clusium and Aricia) and having attained the people&#x27;s favour he overthrew the aristocratic faction and became a tyrant himself. It was probably at this point that Cumae founded Neapolis (“new city”) in the late 6th century BCE.

Further contact between the Romans and the Cumaeans occurred during the reign of Aristodemus. Tarquinius, the last of the legendary Kings of Rome, lived his life in exile with Aristodemus at Cumae after the Battle of Lake Regillus and died there in 495 BCE. Livy records that Aristodemus became the heir of Tarquinius, and in 492 BCE when Roman envoys travelled to Cumae to purchase grain, Aristodemus seized the envoys&#x27; vessels on account of the property of Tarquinius which had been seized at the time of Tarquinius&#x27; exile.

Eventually, the dispossessed nobles and their sons were able to take over Cumae in 490 BCE, and executed Aristodemus.

The combined fleets of Cumae and Syracuse (on Sicily) defeated the Etruscans at the Battle of Cumae in 474 BCE.

The temple of Apollo sent the revered Sibylline Books to Rome in the 5th c. BCE. Also Rome obtained its priestesses who administered the important cult of Ceres from the temple of Demeter in Cumae.

===Oscan and Roman Cumae===


The Greek period at Cumae came to an end in 421 BC, when the Oscans allied to the Samnites broke down the walls and took the city, ravaging the countryside. Some survivors fled to Neapolis.

The walls on the acropolis were rebuilt from 343 BCE. Cumae came under Roman rule with Capua and in 338 BCE was granted partial citizenship, a &quot;civitas sine suffragio&quot;. In the Second Punic War, in spite of temptations to revolt from Roman authority, Cumae withstood Hannibal&#x27;s siege, under the leadership of Tib. Sempronius Gracchus.

The city prospered in the Roman period from the 1st c. BCE along with all the cities of Campania and especially the bay of Naples as it became a desirable area for wealthy Romans who built large villas along the coast. The &quot;central baths&quot; and the amphitheatre are built.

During the civil wars Cumae was one of the strongholds that Octavian used to defend against Sextus Pompey. Under Augustus extensive public building works and roads were begun and in or near Cumae several road tunnels were dug: one through the Monte di Cumae linking the forum with the port, the Grotta di Cocceio 1 km long to Lake Avernus and a third, the &quot;Crypta Romana&quot;, 180m long between Lake Lucrino and Lake Averno. The temples of Apollo and Demeter were restored.

The proximity to Puteoli, the commercial port of Rome and to Misenum, the naval fleet base, also helped the region to prosper.

Another very important innovation was the construction of the great Serino aqueduct, the Aqua Augusta supplying many of the cities in the area from about 20 BC. Domitian&#x27;s via Domitiana provided an important highway to the via Appia and thence to Rome from 95 AD.

The early presence of Christianity in Cumae is shown by the 2nd-century AD work &quot;The Shepherd of Hermas&quot;, in which the author tells of a vision of a woman, identified with the church, who entrusts him with a text to read to the presbyters of the community in Cuma. At the end of the 4th century, the temple of Zeus at Cumae was transformed into a Christian basilica.

The first historically documented bishop of Cumae was Adeodatus, a member of a synod convoked by Pope Hilarius in Rome in 465. Another was Misenus, who was one of the two legates that Pope Felix III sent to Constantinople and who were imprisoned and forced to receive Communion with Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople in a celebration of the Divine Liturgy in which Peter Mongus and other Miaphysites were named in the diptychs, an event that led to the Acacian Schism. Misenus was excommunicated on his return but was later rehabilitated and took part as bishop of Cumae in two synods of Pope Symmachus. Pope Gregory the Great entrusted the administration of the diocese of Cumae to the bishop of Misenum. Later, both Misenum and Cumae ceased to be residential sees and the territory of Cumae became part of the diocese of Aversa after the destruction of Cumae in 1207. Accordingly, Cumae is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

Under Roman rule, so-called &quot;quiet Cumae&quot; was peaceful until the disasters of the Gothic Wars (535–554), when it was repeatedly attacked, as the only fortified city in Campania aside from Neapolis: Belisarius took it in 536, Totila held it, and when Narses gained possession of Cumae, he found he had won the whole treasury of the Goths.

===Diocese of Cuma(e)===

A bishopric was established around 450 AD. In 700 it gained territory from the suppressed Diocese of Miseno.

In 1207 it was suppressed when forces from Naples, acting for the boy-King of Sicily, destroyed the city and its walls, as the stronghold of a nest of bandits. Its territory was divided and merged into the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aversa and Roman Catholic Diocese of Pozzuoli. Some of the citizens from Cumae, including the clergy and the cathedral capitular, took shelter in Giugliano.

====Resident bishops====
* Saint Massenzio (300? – ?)
* Rainaldo (1073? – 1078?)
* Giovanni (1134? – 1141?)
* Gregorio (1187? – ?)
* Leone (1207? – ?)

====Titular see====
In 1970, the diocese was nominally restored as a Latin titular see. The title has been held by:
* Bishop Louis-Marie-Joseph de Courrèges d’Ustou (1970.09.02 – 1970.12.10)
* Archbishop Edoardo Pecoraio (1971.12.28 – 1986.08.09)
* Bishop Julio María Elías Montoya, O.F.M.

==Archaeology==

Despite the abandonment of the area of Cumae due to the formation of marshes, the memory of the ancient city remained alive. The ruins, although in a state of neglect, were later visited by many artists and with the repopulation of the area due to land reclamation, short excavation campaigns were made. The first excavations date to 1606 when thirteen statues and two marble bas-reliefs were found; later finds included the large statue of Jupiter from the Masseria del Gigante exhibited at the National Archaeological Museum of Naples. However, after the discovery of the Vesuvian sites the attention of the Bourbon explorers was diverted there and the Cumae area was abandoned and plundered of numerous finds which were then sold to private individuals. A first campaign of systematic excavations took place between 1852 and 1857 under Prince Leopoldo, brother of Ferdinando II of the Two Sicilies when the area of the Masseria del Gigante and some necropoles were explored. Later Emilio Stevens was given the concession and worked at Cumae between 1878 and 1893, completing the excavation of the necropolis, even though news of the various finds led to a continuous looting of the area.

A disaster occurred between 1910 and 1922 when draining of Lake Licola caused part of the necropolis to be destroyed.
The explorations of the acropolis started in 1911, bringing to light the Temple of Apollo. Between 1924 and 1934 Amedeo Maiuri and Vittorio Spinazzola investigated the Temple of Jupiter, the Cave of the Sibyl and the Crypta Romana, while between 1938 and 1953 the lower city was explored. A chance discovery occurred in 1992 when during the construction of a gas pipeline near the beach a temple of Isis was discovered. In 1994 the &quot;Kyme&quot; project was activated for the restoration of the site. Excavation of the tholos tomb was completed, first partly explored in 1902. In the area of the forum a basilica-shaped building, the Aula Sillana, was discovered, while along the coastline three maritime villas were found.

Since 2001 the CNRS has been excavating a necropolis dating from 6th to 1st c. BCE outside the Porta mediana.

In June 2018 a painted tomb dating to the 2nd century BCE and depicting a banquet scene was discovered.

==Development of the ancient city==
The ancient city was divided into two zones, namely the acropolis and the lower part on the plains and the coast. The acropolis was accessible only from the south side and it was on this area that the first nucleus of the city developed crossed by a road called Via Sacra leading to the main temples. The road began with two towers, one of which collapsed with part of the hill and the other was restored in the Byzantine era and is still visible. The lower city developed from the Samnite period and to a greater extent during the Roman age.

The lower city was defended by walls and during the Greek age the acropolis had probably the same type of defences, even if the remains today dating back to the 6th century BCE are only on the southeastern part of the hill perhaps also used as retaining walls of the ridge.

In the 6th c. BCE temples were built in tufa, wood and terracotta. Columns, cornices and capitals were made of yellow tufa, roofs and architraves of wood and to protect the overhang, terracotta tiles and elaborate antefix decorations. The city and acropolis walls were built from 505 BC, as well as the Sibyl&#x27;s cave.

When the city was allied with the Romans in 338 BCE a new temple was built with exceptional painted friezes and ornamentation which have been discovered though the temple was destroyed after a few decades by fire.

Between the Punic Wars and the adoption of Latin as the official trading language (180 BC) the city walls were restored and a large stadium built west of the Porta mediana. The central baths were built and major work was done on the acropolis temples. From the end of the 2nd c. BCE Cumae&#x27;s architecture became increasingly romanised.

The Augustan age saw many fine new buildings in the city such as the basilica or &quot;Sullan Aula&quot; south of the forum, decorated with polychrome marble. Water supply to the town was increased by an extension to the town of the great Serino aqueduct, the Aqua Augusta, after 20 BCE and paid for by local benefactors, the Lucceii family, praetors of the city, who also built an elaborate nymphaeum in the forum as well as several other monuments and buildings.

In the 1st c. AD the &quot;Temple of the Giant&quot; was built, so-called because the famous giant bust of Jupiter (now in Naples Archaeological Museum) was discovered in its ruins; the walls of the temple are incorporated into a later farmhouse.

After Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, survivors from Herculaneum came to Cumae and it became a well prosperous town.

===Surviving ancient monuments===

The visible monuments include:
*Temple of Diana
*Capitoline temple of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva
*Temple of Isis
*Temple of Demeter
* Temple of Apollo, built in the 6th or 5th century BC, renewed in the late 4th century BC and again under Augustus, transformed into a church around 500 AD.
*The Acropolis
*Arco Felice
*The Forum
*Grotta di Cocceio
*Crypta Romana
*Masseria del Gigante

====Arco Felice====

The Arco Felice was a 20 m high monumental entrance to the city built in a cut through Monte Grillo which Domitian made in 95 AD to avoid the long detour imposed by the via Appia, and allow easier access to Cumae along what was later called the via Domitiana while the bridge also carried a road along the ridge of the hill. It was built of brick and tiled in marble, and surmounted by two rows of arches of lighter concrete covered with brick. The piers had three niches on both sides where statues were placed.

The via Domitiana, whose paving is still perfectly preserved and is in continuous use today, connected to the via Appia, the artery of communication with Rome, as well as with Pozzuoli and Naples.

The arch probably replaced a smaller gate from Greek times and in a higher position.

====Crypta Romana====
The Crypta Romana is a tunnel dug into the tufa under the Cuma hill, crossing the acropolis in an east-west direction, giving an easier route from the city to the sea. Its construction is part of the set of military enhancement works built by Agrippa for Augustus and designed by Lucius Cocceius Auctus in 37 BC, including the construction of the new Portus Iulius and its connection with the port of Cumae through the so-called Grotta di Cocceio and the Crypta Romana itself.

With the displacement of the fleet from Portus Iulius to the port of Miseno in 12 BCE and the end of the Civil War between Octavian and Mark Antony in 31 BCE the tunnel lost its strategic value. The forum entrance was made monumental with 4 statue niches in 95 AD at the same time as the Arco Felice was built. An avalanche closed the sea entrance in the 3rd c. After 397 it was reopened. In the Christian age it was used as a cemetery area; in the 6th c. the Byzantine general Narsete tried to use it to reach the city during the siege of Cumae, but weakened the structure and a large section of the vault collapsed.

It was brought to light between 1925 and 1931 by the archaeologist Amedeus Maiuri.

===Sculpture===
==Mythology==

Cumae is perhaps most famous as the seat of the Cumaean Sibyl. Her sanctuary is now open to the public.

In Roman mythology, there is an entrance to the underworld located at Avernus, a crater lake near Cumae, and was the route Aeneas used to descend to the Underworld.

<text>The sibyls were prophetesses or oracles in Ancient Greece.
The sibyls prophesied at holy sites. 
A sibyl at Delphi has been dated to as early as the eleventh century BC by Pausanias when he described local traditions in his writings from the second century AD.
At first, there appears to have been only a single sibyl. By the fourth century BC, there appear to have been at least three more, Phrygian, Erythraean, and Hellespontine. By the first century BC, there were at least ten sibyls, located in Greece, Italy, the Levant, and Asia Minor.

== History ==

The English word &quot;sibyl&quot; () is from Middle English, via the Old French and the Latin from the ancient Greek (). Varro derived the name from an Aeolic &quot;sioboulla&quot;, the equivalent of Attic &quot;theobule&quot; (&quot;divine counsel&quot;). This etymology is not accepted in modern handbooks, which list the origin as unknown. There have been alternative proposals in nineteenth-century philology suggesting Old Italic or Semitic derivation.

The first known Greek writer to mention a sibyl is (based on the testimony of Plutarch) Heraclitus (fl. 500 BC):
The Sibyl, with frenzied mouth uttering things not to be laughed at, unadorned and unperfumed, yet reaches to a thousand years with her voice by aid of the god.
Walter Burkert observes that &quot;frenzied women from whose lips the god speaks&quot; are recorded very much earlier in the Near East, as in Mari in the second millennium and in Assyria in the first millennium&quot;.

Until the literary elaborations of Roman writers, sibyls were not identified by a personal name, but by names that refer to the location of their &quot;temenos&quot;, or shrine.

In Pausanias, &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, the first sibyl at Delphi mentioned (&quot;the former&quot; [earlier]) was of great antiquity, and was thought, according to Pausanias, to have been given the name &quot;sibyl&quot; by the Libyans. Sir James Frazer calls the text defective.

The second sibyl referred to by Pausanias, and named &quot;Herophile&quot;, seems to have been based ultimately in Samos, but visited other shrines, at Clarus, Delos, and Delphi and sang there, but that at the same time, Delphi had its own sibyl.

James Frazer writes, in his translation and commentary on Pausanias, that only two of the Greek sibyls were historical: Herophile of Erythrae, who is thought to have lived in the eighth century BC, and Phyto of Samos who lived somewhat later. He observes that the Greeks at first seemed to have known only one sibyl, and instances Heraclides Ponticus as the first ancient writer to distinguish several sibyls: Heraclides names at least three sibyls, the Phrygian, the Erythraean, and the Hellespontine. The scholar David S. Potter writes, &quot;In the late fifth century BC it does appear that &#x27;Sibylla&#x27; was the name given to a single inspired prophetess&quot;.

Like Heraclitus, Plato speaks of only one sibyl, but in course of time the number increased to nine, with a tenth, the Tiburtine Sibyl, probably Etruscan in origin, added by the Romans. According to Lactantius&#x27; &quot;Divine Institutions&quot; (Book 1, Ch. 6), Varro (first century BC) lists these ten: the Persian, the Libyan, the Delphic, the Cimmerian, the Erythræan, the Samian, the Cumæan, the Hellespontine (in Trojan territory), the Phrygian (at Ancyra), and the Tiburtine (named Albunea).

== Specific sibyls ==

=== Cimmerian Sibyl ===

Naevius names the Cimmerian Sibyl in his books of the Punic War and Piso in his annals.

Evander, the son of Sibyl, founded in Rome the shrine of Pan that is called the Lupercal.

=== Cumaean Sibyl ===

The sibyl who most concerned the Romans was the Cumaean Sibyl, located near the Greek city of Naples, whom Virgil&#x27;s Aeneas consults before his descent to the lower world (&quot;Aeneid&quot; book VI: 10). Burkert notes (1985, p. 117) that the conquest of Cumae by the Oscans in the fifth century destroyed the tradition, but provides a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; for a Cumaean sibyl. She is said to have sold the original Sibylline books to Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome. In Virgil&#x27;s Fourth Eclogue, the Cumaean sibyl foretells the coming of a savior—possibly a flattering reference to the poet&#x27;s patron, Augustus. Christians later identified this saviour as Jesus.

=== Delphic Sibyl ===

The Delphic Sibyl was a woman who prophesied before the Trojan Wars (c. eleventh century BC). She was noted by Pausanias in his writing during the second century AD about local traditions in Greece. This earliest documented Delphic Sibyl would have predated by hundreds of years the priestess of Apollo active at the oracle from around the eighth century BC who was known as Pythia. As Greek religion passed through transitions to the pantheon of the Classical Greeks that is most familiar to modern readers, Apollo had become the deity represented by Pythia and those who then officiated at the already ancient oracle.

=== Erythraean Sibyl ===

The Erythraean Sibyl was sited at Erythrae, a town in Ionia opposite Chios.

Apollodorus of Erythrae affirms the Erythraean Sibyl to have been his own countrywoman and to have predicted the Trojan War and prophesied to the Greeks who were moving against Ilium both that Troy would be destroyed and that Homer would write falsehoods.

The word &quot;acrostic&quot; was first applied to the prophecies of the Erythraean Sibyl, which were written on leaves and arranged so that the initial letters of the leaves always formed a word.

=== Hellespontine Sibyl ===

The Hellespontine, or Trojan Sibyl, presided over the Apollonian oracle at Dardania.

The Hellespontian Sibyl was born in the village of Marpessus near the small town of Gergitha, during the lifetimes of Solon and Cyrus the Great. Marpessus, according to Heraclides of Pontus, was formerly within the boundaries of the Troad. The sibylline collection at Gergis was attributed to the Hellespontine Sibyl and was preserved in the temple of Apollo at Gergis. Thence it passed to Erythrae, where it became famous.

=== Libyan Sibyl ===
The so-called Libyan Sibyl was identified with prophetic priestesses presiding over the ancient Zeus-Amon (Zeus represented with the horns of Amon) oracle at the Siwa Oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt. The oracle here was consulted by Alexander after his conquest of Egypt. The mother of the Libyan Sibyl was Lamia, the daughter of Poseidon. Euripides mentions the Libyan Sibyl in the prologue to his tragedy &quot;Lamia&quot;.

=== Persian Sibyl ===

The Persian Sibyl was said to be a prophetic priestess presiding over the Apollonian Oracle; although her location remained vague enough so that she might be called the &quot;Babylonian Sibyl&quot;, the Persian Sibyl is said to have foretold the exploits of Alexander the Great. Also named &quot;Sambethe&quot;, she was reported to be of the family of Noah. The second-century AD traveller Pausanias, pausing at Delphi to enumerate four sibyls, mentions the &quot;Hebrew Sibyl&quot; who was brought up in Palestine named Sabbe, whose father was Berosus and her mother Erymanthe. Some say she was a Babylonian, while others call her an Egyptian Sibyl. 

The medieval Byzantine encyclopedia, the &quot;Suda&quot;, credits the Hebrew Sibyl as author of the Sibylline oracles.

=== Phrygian Sibyl ===

The Phrygian Sibyl is most well known for being conflated with Cassandra, Priam&#x27;s daughter in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;.
The Phrygian Sibyl appears to be a doublet of the Hellespontine Sibyl.

=== Samian Sibyl ===

The Samian sibyl&#x27;s oracular site was at Samos.

=== Tiburtine Sibyl ===

To the classical sibyls of the Greeks, the Romans added a tenth, the Tiburtine Sibyl, whose seat was the ancient Sabino–Latin town of Tibur (modern Tivoli). The mythic meeting of Augustus with the Sibyl, of whom he inquired whether he should be worshiped as a god, was a favored of Christian artists. Whether the sibyl in question was the Etruscan Sibyl of Tibur or the Greek Sibyl of Cumae is not always clear. The Christian author Lactantius had no hesitation in identifying the sibyl in question as the Tiburtine Sibyl, nevertheless. He gave a circumstantial account of the pagan sibyls that is useful mostly as a guide to their identifications, as seen by fourth-century Christians:
The Tiburtine Sibyl, by name &quot;Albunea&quot;, is worshiped at Tibur as a goddess, near the banks of the Anio, in which stream her image is said to have been found, holding a book in her hand. Her oracular responses the Senate transferred into the capitol. (&quot;Divine Institutes&quot; I.vi) 

An apocalyptic pseudo-prophecy exists, attributed to the Tiburtine Sibyl, written c. AD 380, but with revisions and interpolations added at later dates. It purports to prophesy the advent of a final emperor named Constans, vanquishing the foes of Christianity, bringing about a period of great wealth and peace, ending paganism, and converting the Jews. After vanquishing Gog and Magog, the emperor is said to resign his crown to God. This would give way to the Antichrist. Ippolito d&#x27;Este rebuilt the Villa d&#x27;Este at Tibur, the modern Tivoli, from 1550 onward, and commissioned elaborate fresco murals in the Villa that celebrate the Tiburtine Sibyl, as prophesying the birth of Christ to the classical world.

== In Renaissance art and literature ==

In Medieval Latin, &quot;sibylla&quot; simply became the term for &quot;prophetess&quot;. It became used commonly in Late Gothic and Renaissance art to depict female &quot;Sibyllae&quot; alongside male prophets.
The number of sibyls so depicted could vary, sometimes they were twelve (See, for example, the Apennine Sibyl), sometimes ten, e.g. for François Rabelais, &quot;How know we but that she may be an eleventh sibyl or a second Cassandra?&quot; &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, iii. 16, noted in &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot;, 1897.
The best known depiction is that of Michelangelo who shows five sibyls in the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel ceiling; the Delphic Sibyl, Libyan Sibyl, Persian Sibyl, Cumaean Sibyl, and the Erythraean Sibyl. 
The library of Pope Julius II in the Vatican has images of sibyls and they are in the pavement of the Siena Cathedral. The Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli crowning the Campidoglio, Rome, is particularly associated with the Sibyl, because a medieval tradition referred the origin of its name to an otherwise unattested altar, &quot;Ara Primogeniti Dei&quot;, said to have been raised to the &quot;firstborn of God&quot; by the emperor Augustus, who had been warned of his advent by the sibylline books: in the church the figures of Augustus and of the Tiburtine Sibyl are painted on either side of the arch above the high altar. In the nineteenth century, Rodolfo Lanciani recalled that at Christmastime the included a carved and painted figure of the sibyl pointing out to Augustus the Virgin and Child, who appeared in the sky in a halo of light. &quot;The two figures, carved in wood, have now [1896] disappeared; they were given away or sold thirty years ago, when a new set of images was offered to the Presepio by prince Alexander Torlonia.&quot; (Lanciani, 1896 ch 1) Like prophets, Renaissance sibyls forecasting the advent of Christ appear in monuments: modelled by Giacomo della Porta in the Santa Casa at Loreto, painted by Raphael in Santa Maria della Pace, by Pinturicchio in the Borgia apartments of the Vatican, engraved by Baccio Baldini, a contemporary of Botticelli, and graffites by Matteo di Giovanni in the pavement of the Duomo of Siena.
Shakespeare references the sibyls in his plays, including &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, and especially &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. In the latter, Shakespeare employed the common Renaissance comparison of Cassandra to a sibyl.

A collection of twelve motets by Orlande de Lassus entitled (pub. 1600) draw inspiration from the sibyl figures of antiquity. The work—for four voices a cappella—consists of a prologue and twelve prophecies, each once corresponding to an individual Sibyl. While the text speaks of the coming of Jesus Christ, the composer reflects the mystical aura of the prophecies by using chromaticism in an extreme manner, a compositional technique that became very fashionable at the time. It is possible that Lassus not only viewed Michelangelo&#x27;s depictions, but also drew the chromatic manière from a number of Italian composers, who experimented at the time.
== Sibylline books ==

The sayings of sibyls and oracles were notoriously open to interpretation (compare Nostradamus) and were constantly used for both civil and cult propaganda. These sayings and sibyls should not be confused with the extant sixth-century collection of &quot;Sibylline Oracles&quot;, which typically predict disasters rather than prescribe solutions.

Some genuine Sibylline verses are preserved in the second-century &quot;Book of Marvels&quot; of Phlegon of Tralles.
The oldest collection of written Sibylline Books appears to have been made about the time of Solon and Cyrus at Gergis on Mount Ida in the Troad. The sibyl, who was born near there, at Marpessus, and whose tomb was later marked by the temple of Apollo built upon the archaic site, appears on the coins of Gergis, 400–350 BCE. (cf. Phlegon, quoted in the fifth-century geographical dictionary of Stephanus of Byzantium, under &#x27;Gergis&#x27;). Other places claimed to have been her home. The sibylline collection at Gergis was attributed to the Hellespontine Sibyl and was preserved in the temple of Apollo at Gergis. Thence it passed to Erythrae, where it became famous. It was this very collection, it would appear, which found its way to Cumae and from Cumae to Rome. Gergis, a city of Dardania in the Troad, a settlement of the ancient Teucri, and, consequently, a town of very great antiquity. Gergis, according to Xenophon, was a place of much strength. It had a temple sacred to Apollo Gergithius, and was said to have given birth to the sibyl, who is sometimes called &quot;Erythraea&quot;, ‘from Erythrae,’ a small place on Mount Ida, and at others &quot;Gergithia&quot; ‘of Gergis’.

<text>Verden an der Aller (; Northern Low Saxon: &quot;Veern&quot;), also called Verden (Aller) or simply Verden, is a town in Lower Saxony, Germany, on the river Aller. It is the district town of the district of Verden in Lower Saxony and an independent municipality (:de:Selbständige Gemeinde). The town is located in the middle Weser region on the Aller river immediately before it flows into the Weser. As a center of horse breeding and equestrian sports, it bears the nickname &quot;equestrian town&quot;. The suffix &quot;Aller&quot; was introduced at a time when the name &quot;Verden&quot; was also common for the French town of Verdun in the German-speaking area. The town name comes from &quot;ford&quot; or &quot;ferry&quot;. The town was conveniently located at a ford through the Aller river, near an important trade route.

Verden is famous for a massacre of Saxons in 782, committed on the orders of Charlemagne (the Massacre of Verden), for its cathedral, and for its horse-breeding.

==History==
In the Early Middle Ages (year 782) there was a massacre of allegedly 4,500 Saxons, by order of Charlemagne because of their involvement in a preceding uprising. Verden was then within the Duchy of Saxony.

After in 1180 a coalition of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and his allies had defeated the then Saxo-Bavarian Duke Henry the Lion. Henry was subsequently stripped of his duchies. Saxony was divided among the imperial coalitionaries and so the Catholic Bishop of Verden gained imperial immediacy for parts of his diocesan territory, thus establishing the Prince-Bishopric of Verden.

On 12 March 1259 Prince-Bishop Gerhard of Verden granted the place town privileges following the Bremian version of German town law. In the 15th century Verden gained considerable independence as a Free Imperial City, immediately under the emperors (imperial immediacy), circumventing its former overlords the prince-bishops, who still held the cathedral and pertaining premises in town as a cathedral immunity district.

By the Peace of Westphalia the city of Verden was mediatised as regular city again within the Prince-Bishopric of Verden, which was transformed by the same contract into the Principality of Verden in May 1648. The northern city (with the town hall and St. John&#x27;s church) and the southern town (with the proto-cathedral) were then united to form one city.

In 1675, during the Swedish-Brandenburg War, Verden was conquered by several states of the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark following the Bremen-Verden Campaign and remained in allied hands until the end of the war in 1679. In the wake of the Treaty of Saint-Germain in 1679, Verden was returned to Sweden.

The Principality of Verden was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown – interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712–1715) – and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. The Kingdom of Hanover incorporated the principality in a real union and the princely territory, including Verden upon Aller, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823.

Until the Second World War, Verden was renowned for its trade and crafts and also its mounted division. During the Nazi regime forced-labourers were used in a furniture factory in Verden. Between 1945 and 1949 Verden was part of the British zone of occupation. Refugees from the former Prussian provinces of East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia, settled in and around the town.

With the labour immigration from the East German Democratic Republic inhibited by the Berlin Wall foreign workers (Gastarbeiter) started to arrive from southern Europe and Anatolia in the 1960s. After the fall of Communism more immigrants arrived from Eastern Europe.

From 1945 until 1960, the 5th Division, of the British Army of the Rhine, was stationed in Verden. In 1960, the division was renamed as the 1st Division (later 1st Armoured Division). One of the former British barracks is now used to house the &quot;Kreisverwaltung&quot; (district administration) and a new sporting stadium has been erected opposite. The second barracks has been demolished to make way for a new residential estate.

==Geography==
Verden is located in the German state of Lower Saxony, on the river Aller. It is the administrative centre of the district of Verden. The nearest large cities are Bremen () and Hannover ().

==Sights==

The old town lies east of the Aller. The Lutheran cathedral () is known as the &quot;&quot; and towers above the pedestrianised high street, with its cafés and shops. This proto-cathedral, consecrated to Ss. Mary and Cecilia, served the former Catholic Diocese of Verden as episcopal church and was built between the 12th and 15th centuries. Other noteworthy buildings include the Lutheran churches of St. John and of St. Andrew, as well as the town hall and the &quot;Domherrenhaus&quot; (House of cathedral canons).

Verden is further renowned for horse racing and sport horse auctions and is thus also called the (horse) riding town ().

==Infrastructure==
East of Verden, there is the tall radio transmitter, , used by Deutsche Telekom primarily for TV and mobile phone broadcasting.

in 2009, the derelict fodder silo towering over the town won the prize of being &quot;The ugliest wall in North Germany&quot; in a Radio Bremen Vier competition. The prize was to be decorated with a large mural by Graffiti Artists Markus Genesius and Stefan of WOW123. The mural can now be seen above the town skyline.

Mars Petcare has its largest pet food factory in Europe, with a large research centre similar to the Waltham Petcare Science Institute in the UK.

<doc id="180380" wikidata="Q302980" url="?curid=180380" title="Hibernia">
<text> () is the Classical Latin name for Ireland. The name &quot;Hibernia&quot; was taken from Greek geographical accounts. During his exploration of northwest Europe (), Pytheas of Massalia called the island &quot;Iérnē&quot; (written ). In his book &quot;Geographia&quot; (), Claudius Ptolemaeus (&quot;Ptolemy&quot;) called the island &quot;Iouerníā&quot; (written , where &quot;ου&quot;/&quot;ou&quot; stands for &quot;w&quot;). The Roman historian Tacitus, in his book &quot;Agricola&quot; (), uses the name Hibernia.

 &quot;Iouerníā&quot; was a Greek rendering of the Q-Celtic name *&quot;Īweriū&quot;, from which eventually arose the Irish names &quot;Ériu&quot; and &quot;Éire&quot;. The name was altered in Latin (influenced by the word &quot;&quot;) as though it meant &quot;land of winter&quot;, although the word for winter began with a long &#x27;i&#x27;.

==Post-Roman usage==
The High King Brian Boru (c. 941–1014) based his title on being emperor of the Scoti, which was in Latin &quot;Imperator &quot;, emperor of the Gaels. From 1172, the Lordship of Ireland gave the King of England the additional title &quot;Dominus Hibernie&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;, for &quot;Hiberniae&quot;; also &quot;Dominus Hybernie&quot;), &#x27;Lord of Ireland&#x27;. The Kingdom of Ireland created the title &quot;Rex Hiberniae&quot;, King of Ireland, for use in Latin texts. Gerardus Mercator called Ireland &quot;Hybernia&quot; on his world map of 1541. In 1642, the motto of the Irish Confederates, a Catholic-landlord administration that ruled much of Ireland until 1650, was .

By the classicising 18th century, the use of Hibernia had revived in some contexts, just as had the use of Caledonia, one of the Latin terms for Scotland, and Britannia for Britain. &quot;Hibernia&quot; was used on Irish coins in the 1700s, and on a 2016 2 euro coin. Companies such as the Hibernian Insurance Company were established (later renamed the Hibernian Group). The name took on popularity with the success of the Irish Patriot Party. At a time when Palladian classical architecture and design were being adopted in northern Europe, Hibernia was a useful word to describe Ireland with overtones of classical style and civility, including by the prosperous Anglo-Irish Ascendancy who were taught Latin at school. &quot;Hibernian&quot; was used as a term for people, and a general adjective. The Royal Exchange in Dublin was built during 1769–1779 with the carved inscription &quot;SPQH&quot; for . The Royal Hibernian Academy dates from 1823.

The 18th-century Spanish regiment composed of Irish exiles was known as the Regiment of Hibernia.

Hibernia is a word that is rarely used today with regard to Ireland, except in long-established names. It is occasionally used for names of organisations and various other things; for instance: Hibernia National Bank, Hibernian Insurance Group, Ancient Order of Hibernians, &quot;The Hibernian&quot; magazine, Hibernia College, Hibernian Orchestra, Hibernian Football Club, , and modern derivatives, from Latin like and . In Canada, Hibernia lends its name to the Hibernia oil field off Newfoundland, and to a large offshore oil platform, the Hibernia Gravity Base Structure.

Another occurrence is in familial Hibernian fever or TRAPS (tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome), a periodic fever first described in 1982 in a family of Irish and Scottish descent, but found in all ethnic groups.

The compound form &#x27;Hiberno-&#x27; remains more common, as &#x27;Hiberno-Norse&#x27;, &#x27;Hiberno-English&#x27;, &#x27;Hiberno-Scottish&#x27;, &#x27;Hibernophile&#x27;, etc.

The Scottish football clubs Hibernian FC and Dundee Hibernian (now Dundee Utd) have adopted the name.

<text>Curia (: curiae) in ancient Rome referred to one of the original groupings of the citizenry, eventually numbering 30, and later every Roman citizen was presumed to belong to one. While they originally probably had wider powers, they came to meet for only a few purposes by the end of the Republic: to confirm the election of magistrates with imperium, to witness the installation of priests, the making of wills, and to carry out certain adoptions.

The term is more broadly used to designate an assembly, council, or court, in which public, official, or religious issues are discussed and decided. Lesser curiae existed for other purposes. The word &quot;curia&quot; also came to denote the places of assembly, especially of the senate. Similar institutions existed in other towns and cities of Italy.

In medieval times, a king&#x27;s council was often referred to as a curia. Today, the most famous curia is the Curia of the Roman Catholic Church, which assists the Roman Pontiff in the hierarchical government of the Church.

==Origins==
The word &quot;curia&quot; is thought to derive from Old Latin &quot;coviria&quot;, meaning &#x27;a gathering of men&#x27; (&quot;co-&quot;, &#x27;together&#x27; = &quot;vir&quot;, &#x27;man&#x27;). In this sense, any assembly, public or private, could be called a &quot;curia&quot;. In addition to the Roman curiae, voting assemblies known as curiae existed in other towns of Latium, and similar institutions existed in other parts of Italy. During the republic, local curiae were established in Italian and provincial &quot;municipia&quot; and &quot;coloniae&quot;. In imperial times, local magistrates were often elected by municipal senates, which also came to be known as curiae. By extension, the word &quot;curia&quot; came to mean not just a gathering, but also the place where an assembly would gather, such as a meeting house.

==Roman curiae==
In Roman times, &quot;curia&quot; had two principal meanings. Originally it applied to the wards of the &quot;comitia curiata&quot;. However, over time the name became applied to the senate house, which in its various incarnations housed meetings of the Roman senate from the time of the kings until the beginning of the seventh century AD.

===&quot;Comitia curiata&quot;===

The most important curiae at Rome were the 30 that together made up the comitia curiata. Traditionally ascribed to the kings, each of the three tribes established by Romulus, the &quot;Ramnes, Tities&quot;, and &quot;Luceres&quot;, was divided into ten curiae. In theory, each &quot;gens&quot; (family, clan) belonged to a particular curia, although whether this was strictly observed throughout Roman history is uncertain.

Each curia had a distinct name, said to have been derived from the names of some of the Sabine women abducted by the Romans in the time of Romulus. However, some of the curiae evidently derived their names from particular districts or eponymous heroes. The curiae were probably established geographically, representing specific neighborhoods in Rome, for which reason &quot;curia&quot; is sometimes translated as &#x27;ward&#x27;. Only a few of the names of the 30 curiae have been preserved, including &quot;Acculeia, Calabra, Faucia, Foriensis, Rapta, Veliensis, Tifata&quot;, and &quot;Titia.&quot;

The assertion that the plebeians were not members of the curiae, or that only the dependents (&quot;clientes&quot;) of the patricians were admitted, and not entitled to vote, is expressly contradicted by Dionysius. This argument is also refuted by Mommsen.

Each curia had its own &quot;sacra&quot;, in which its members, known as &quot;curiales,&quot; worshipped the gods of the state and other deities specific to the curia, with their own rites and ceremonies. Each curia had a meeting site and place of worship, named after the curia. Originally, this may have been a simple altar, then a &quot;sacellum&quot;, and finally a meeting house.

The curia was presided over by a &quot;curio&quot; (: &quot;curiones&quot;), who was always at least 50 years old, and was elected for life. The &quot;curio&quot; undertook the religious affairs of the curia. He was assisted by another priest, known as the &quot;flamen curialis&quot;. When the 30 curiae gathered to make up the &quot;comitia curiata&quot;, they were presided over by a &quot;curio maximus&quot;, who until 209 BC was always a patrician. Originally, the &quot;curio maximus&quot; was probably elected by the &quot;curiones&quot;, but in later times by the people themselves. Each curia was attended by one lictor; an assembly of the &quot;comitia curiata&quot; was attended by thirty lictors.

The &quot;comitia curiata&quot; voted to confirm the election of magistrates by passing a law called the &quot;lex curiata de imperio&quot;. It also witnessed the installation of priests, and adoptions, and the making of wills. The Pontifex Maximus may have presided over these ceremonies. The assembly probably possessed much greater authority before the establishment of the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot;, which gradually assumed many of the curiate assembly&#x27;s original functions.

===Senate House===
Since the Roman Kingdom, the meeting-house of the Roman senate was known as the curia. The original meeting place was said to have been a temple built on the spot where the Romans and Sabines laid down their arms during the reign of Romulus (traditionally reigned 753–717 BC). The institution of the senate was always ascribed to Romulus; although the first senate was said to comprise 100 members, the earliest number which can be called certain is 300, probably connected with the three tribes and 30 curiae also attributed to Romulus.

====&quot;Curia Hostilia&quot;====

After the original temple was destroyed by fire, it was replaced by a new meeting house by Tullus Hostilius, the third King of Rome (traditionally reigned 673–642 BC). The &quot;Curia Hostilia&quot; stood on the north end of the Comitium, where the &quot;comitia curiata&quot; and other Roman assemblies met, and was oriented along the four cardinal points. After more than 500 years of service, the building was restored and enlarged by the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 80 BC. Sulla had doubled the senate&#x27;s membership from 300 to 600, necessitating a larger building, which retained the original orientation of the &quot;Curia Hostilia&quot;, but extended further south into the comitium. In 52 BC, following the murder of Publius Clodius Pulcher, his &quot;clientes&quot; set fire to the senate house, which was rebuilt by Faustus Cornelius Sulla, son of the dictator. Following this reconstruction, the building came to be called the &quot;Curia Cornelia.&quot;

====&quot;Curia Julia&quot;====

A generation after Sulla enlarged the senate from 300 members to 600, Julius Caesar increased its membership to 900, necessitating the construction of a larger meeting house. Shortly before his death in 44 BC, Caesar began the construction of a new building, which became known as the &quot;Curia Julia&quot;. This structure covered most of the &quot;comitium&quot;, and abandoned the original orientation of the previous curiae, pointing slightly northwest. The building featured a large central hall with a daïs for magistrates, and marble benches on one side. There was also a record office on one side. The building was completed by Caesar&#x27;s grandnephew, Octavian, the future emperor Augustus, in 29 BC, although he reduced the senate itself to its former number of 600. The &quot;Curia Cornelia&quot; was demolished, but the precise date is not known.

In AD 94, the &quot;Curia Julia&quot; was rebuilt along Caesar&#x27;s original plan by the emperor Domitian, who also restored the former orientation of the &quot;Curia Hostilia&quot;. The building was damaged by fire during the reign of Carinus in 283, and again restored under his successor, Diocletian. The Roman Senate is last mentioned in AD 600. In 630, Pope Honorius I transformed the senate house into the church of Sant&#x27;Adriano al Foro, preserving the structure at its full height. In 1923, the church and an adjacent convent were bought by the Italian government. The building was further restored from 1935 to 1937, removing various medieval additions, to reveal the original Roman architecture.

===&quot;Curiae Veteres&quot;===
The &quot;Curiae Veteres&quot; was the earliest sanctuary of the thirty curiae. It is discussed by both Varro and by Tacitus, who mentions it as one point of the Palatine pomerium of &quot;Roma quadrata&quot;. It is probable that this shrine was located at the northeast corner of the Palatine Hill. Its remains have likely been identified in excavations carried out by Clementina Panella. As the Republic continued, the curiae grew too large to meet conveniently at the &quot;Curiae Veteres&quot;, and a new meeting place, the &quot;Curiae Novae&quot;, was constructed. A few of the curiae continued to meet at the &quot;Curiae Veteres&quot; due to specific religious obligations.

===Municipal curiae===

In the Roman Empire a town council was known as a curia, or sometimes an &quot;ordo&quot;, or &quot;boule&quot;. The existence of such a governing body was the mark of an independent city. Municipal curiae were co-optive, and their members, the decurions, sat for life. Their numbers varied greatly according to the size of the city. In the Western Empire, one hundred seems to have been a common number, but in the East five hundred was customary, on the model of the Athenian Boule. However, by the fourth century, curial duties had become onerous, and it was difficult to fill all the posts; often candidates had to be nominated. The emperor Constantine exempted Christians from serving in the curiae, which led to many rich pagans claiming to be priests in order to escape these duties.

==Other curiae==
The concept of the curia as a governing body, or the court where such a body met, carried on into medieval times, both as a secular institution, and in the church.

===Medieval curiae===

In medieval times, a king&#x27;s court was frequently known as the &quot;curia regis&quot;, consisting of the king&#x27;s chief magnates and councilors. In England, the &quot;curia regis&quot; gradually developed into Parliament. In France, the &quot;curia regis&quot; or Conseil du Roi developed in the twelfth century, with the term gradually becoming applied to a judicial body, and falling out of use by the fourteenth century.

===Roman Catholic Church===
In the Roman Catholic Church, the administrative body of the Holy See is known as the &quot;Roman Curia&quot;. It is through this Curia that the Roman Pontiff conducts the business of the Church as a whole.

Among older religious orders, the governing council of the Superior General or Regional Superior and his or her assistants is referred to their Curia.

===Modern usage===

The Court of Justice of the European Union uses &quot;CURIA&quot; (in roman script) in its official emblem.

The term &quot;curia&quot; may refer to separate electoral colleges in a system of reserved political positions (reserved seats), e.g. during the British mandate of Palestine at the third election (1931) of the Asefat HaNivharim there were three curiae, for the Ashkenazi Jews, the Sephardi Jews and for the Yemeni Jews.

In the United States Supreme Court an interested third party to a case may file a brief as an amicus curiae.

Under the Fundamental Law adopted in 2011, Hungary&#x27;s supreme court is called the Curia.

The Federal Palace of Switzerland, the seat of the Swiss Confederation, bears the inscription &quot;Curia Confœderationis Helveticæ&quot;.

<text>The Bank of Mexico (), abbreviated &quot;BdeM&quot; or &quot;Banxico,&quot; is Mexico&#x27;s central bank, monetary authority and lender of last resort. The Bank of Mexico is autonomous in exercising its functions, and its main objective is to achieve stability in the purchasing power of the national currency.

== Background ==

Plans for a central bank of Mexico began as early as the Mexican Empire of Emperor Agustín de Iturbide with his idea of a &quot;Gran Banco del Imperio Mexicano&quot; (Grand Bank of the Mexican Empire). This idea was never pursued, instead, credit was generally issued by religious orders or trading guilds. In 1827, Mexico defaulted on a loan from British lenders which made it difficult to find foreign capital and it was forced to rely on local lenders as it had no national bank to lend to it. Instead the government was forced to rely on domestic lenders known as agiotistas (speculators) who specialized in short-term, high-interest loans.

The first formal bank organized by the government was the Banco de Avío which was formed in 1830 during the presidency of Anastasio Bustamante under the direction of the Minister of Interior and Foreign Affairs, Lucas Alamán. The primary purpose of the bank was to stimulate the manufacturing and textile industries. Its success was confined mainly to the latter, but due to ongoing political and military crises the bank was eventually closed in 1842 by President Antonio López de Santa Anna.

The Mexican government had decreed the establishment of a national bank in 1837, which similarly had to close in December, 1841.

=== Private banking ===

The first major private bank in Mexico was opened under the period of the Second Mexican Empire in 1864 when the &quot;Banco de Londres, México y Sud America&quot; (Bank of London, Mexico and South America) opened in Mexico City.

In the 1870s, the &quot;Banco de Santa Eulalia&quot; opened in Chihuahua and the &quot;Monte de Piedad&quot;, which had functioned as a pawnshop since 1775, expanded its services into banking. Both banks issued their own bank notes and many more banks followed suit in the next decade, including the &quot;Banco Nacional Mexicano&quot; (Mexican National Bank) in 1882, opened by the administration of President Manuel González.

In 1884, the &quot;Banco Nacional Mexicano&quot; soon merged with &quot;Banco Mercantil Mexicano&quot; (Mexican Mercantile Bank) to form the &quot;Banco Nacional de México&quot; (National Bank of Mexico) which issued notes and was the primary lender to the government. The same year government issued a commercial code that gave it control of the banking sector, including the responsibility of chartering banks and establishing minimum levels of capital. The new code also stipulated that all paper money had to be backed by gold or silver on deposit in the national treasury.

The next 15 years were turbulent for the banking sector of Mexico. Due to poor management, the &quot;Monte de Piedad&quot; temporarily closed, reopening without its banking services. The government mismanaged the emission of a new non-silver coin and was forced to hastily recall it. Both of these events caused the public to lose confidence in the banks and paper money.

=== Porfiriato ===

In 1897, during the presidency of Porfirio Díaz, Finance Minister José Yves Limantour helped to guide the passing of the &quot;Ley de Instituciones de Crédito&quot; (Law of Credit Institutions). The new law grouped banks into three categories: issuing banks, mortgage loan banks, and auxiliary development banks. Issuing banks were allowed to circulate banknotes within the state they were issued, but only the &quot;Banco Nacional de México&quot; and the &quot;Banco de Londres y Mexico&quot; notes were allowed to circulate nationally. They were also authorized to make short-term loans. Mortgage banks were authorized to make loans collateralized by real estate for periods up to 40 years. The auxiliary development banks were authorized to make loans for periods up to two years for the purpose of financing industrial endeavors such as mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. Nationwide, there were 24 banks with issuing authority, two mortgage banks, and five auxiliary development banks.

In 1908, Limantour issued new reforms to protect the Mexican economy from weaknesses exposed by the US financial crisis of 1907. These reforms prevented emissions banks from opening new branches and required them to convert themselves into auxiliary or mortgage banks. These changes had limited success, and though Limantour predicted a budget surplus for 1911, the collapse of the Porfirian regime and the intensification of the Revolution ground normal banking activity to a halt.

=== Revolution ===

In 1911 Francisco I. Madero took power from Díaz. Madero worked to increase the number of banks in the country but he was not trusted by the United States which worked with one of Madero&#x27;s generals, Victoriano Huerta, to overthrow him in February 1913. When Huerta took power in 1913, he confiscated all of the metal backed banknotes from private issuing banks then issued unbacked banknotes into circulation, crippling the national banking system.

When Huerta was forced from office, the number of banknotes issued multiplied and the population began to lose faith in paper money. As warlords ravaged the country vying for control, they forced banks to make exorbitant loans or they looted them. In 1916 Venustiano Carranza declared that all banks must fully back their banknotes with metal. The 1897 law said that private banks only had to back 33% of the value of their issued notes, consequently all of the private banks were dissolved and their assets seized. That same year Carranza issued his own &quot;unforgeable&quot; notes in May though these lost all value by July of the same year. The banks seized by Carranza weren&#x27;t returned to their owners until the administration of Álvaro Obregón in 1921.

== Foundation ==

The current constitution of Mexico was signed in 1917. Article 28 of that constitution stipulated that all paper money would be issued by a single bank controlled by the government. But it was not until the end of 1924 that the &quot;Ley General de Instituciones de Crédito&quot; (General Law of Credit Institutions) was passed which was the legal antecedent for the Banco de México. The law prevented banks from owning stock in other banks and eliminated the stock exemption for banks. Most importantly, the law called for the creation of a central bank.

The Banco de México was created on August 25, 1925, under the direction of Minister of Finance Alberto J. Pani with an official ceremony given on September 1, 1925. It was given exclusive authority to mint coins and print banknotes, a sharp departure from policies of the past. The bank was also given responsibility over exchange rates, interest rates, and monetary regulation. Initially, retail banks even had the option not to partner with Banco de México. The main goals of the Bank at that time were to unify the fractured banking system left behind by the Revolution, create a flexible financial system that could modernize the country, reestablish credit, and renew trust in paper money.

The bank&#x27;s first years were difficult. Initially only two private banks affiliated themselves with Banco de México, and by 1927, in the midst of the Christero War, the bank exceeded the legal limit of how much it could loan to the government. The unease of the private banking institution was assuaged somewhat when the initial offices of Banco de México were temporarily located in the headquarters of the &quot;Banco de Londres y Mexico&quot;. The banking interests cemented their relationship with the government by issuing loans to government officials, ensuring that the politicians had a vested interest in the stability of the system.

In 1932, laws were passed that required all private banks to invest their capital in Mexico and associate themselves with Banco de México. The laws also required that Banco de México cease operating as a commercial bank. After passage of this legislation, only three foreign banks remained in the country. These changes and a looser restriction on the issuance of banknotes led to a growing trust in the central bank.

<text>Butrint (, , ) was an ancient Greek polis and later Roman city and the seat of an early Christian bishopric in Epirus. 

Originally a settlement of the Greek tribe of the Chaonians, it later became part of the state of Epirus and later a Roman &quot;colonia&quot; and a Byzantine bishopric. It entered into decline in Late Antiquity, before being abandoned during the Middle Ages after a major earthquake flooded most of the city. In modern times it is an archeological site in Vlorë County, Albania, some south of Sarandë, close to the Greek border. It is located on a hill overlooking the Vivari Channel and is part of the Butrint National Park. Today Bouthrotum is a Latin Catholic titular see and also features the Ali Pasha Castle.

The city is considered one of the most important archaeological sites in Albania. On the strength of the immense wealth of cultural, historical and natural value with a considerable history, Butrint was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992 and further a National Park in 2000 under the leadership of Auron Tare, its first director.

== History ==
===Prehistory===
The earliest archaeological evidence of settled occupation dates to between 10th and 8th centuries BC, although some claim that there is earlier evidence of habitation dating from the 12th century BC.

=== Ancient Greek period ===

Excavation at Bouthroton has yielded Proto-Corinthian pottery of the 7th century and then Corinthian and Attic pottery of the 6th century, however there are no indications of a prehistoric settlement. &quot;Bouthroton&quot; was in a strategically important position due its access to the Straits of Corfu, and its location at the crossroads of mainland Greece and Magna Graecia, the Greek and the &quot;barbarian&quot; worlds. Thus, it became one of the two ancient ports in lower Chaonia, the other being Onchesmos (modern Sarandë).

&quot;Bouthroton&quot; (modern day Butrint) was originally one of the major centres of the Epirote tribe of the Chaonians, part of the northwestern Greek group of tribes. They had close contacts to the Corinthian colony of Corcyra (modern Corfu). According to the Roman writer Virgil, its legendary founder was the seer Helenus, a son of king Priam of Troy, who had moved West after the fall of Troy with Neoptolemus and his concubine Andromache. Both Virgil and the Greek historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus recorded that Aeneas visited &quot;Bouthroton&quot; after his own escape from the destruction of Troy.

The acropolis was erected on a hill on the bank of a lake Butrint (or lake Bouthrotum). The first extension of the 7th century BC acropolis occurred during the 5th century BC. During the first years of the second Peloponnesian War (413-404 BC) the Corkyreans built fortifications stretching from Ksamil to Buthrotum. Buthrotum being previously an independent city, became subject to nearby Corfu.

By the 4th century BC it had grown in importance and included a theatre, a sanctuary dedicated to Asclepius and an agora. The acropolis of Bouthrotum was protected by three circuit walls. The last and outer wall was erected around 380 BC enclosing and area of 4ha. This 870m-long wall included bastions and five gates. Two of the most important gates were known as Scean and Lion gate. Moreover, the agora, the stoas, the residential zone and the theatre were located in a separate walled area.

Several inscriptions in Buthrotum describe the organization of the Chaonians in the beginning of the 3rd cent. BC. which show that they too had an annual leader called &quot;Prostates&quot; ( Protector). The Greek calendar of Bouthroton appears in the oldest known analog computer, the so-called Antikythera Mechanism (c. 150 to 100 BC).

The theatre is known for the impressive number of inscriptions carved on its stones. Most of them deal with manumissions and give a great amount of details on the city during the Hellenistic era. The names of those slaves were almost exclusively Greek with a few exception of Latin ones which bore Greek family names.

In 228 BC &quot;Buthrotum&quot; became a Roman protectorate alongside Corfu. In the middle of the second century BC Buthrotum was the centre of an independent state, possibly the &quot;Koinon of the Prasaiboi&quot;, as listed in the list of the theorodokoi at the Oracle of Delphi.

=== Ancient Roman period ===
In the next century, it became a part of a province of Macedonia. In 44 BC, Caesar designated &quot;Buthrotum&quot; as a colony to reward soldiers who had fought for him against Pompey. Local landholder Titus Pomponius Atticus objected to his correspondent Cicero who lobbied against the plan in the Senate. As a result, only small numbers of colonists were settled.
In 31 BC, Roman Emperor Augustus fresh from his victory over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the battle of Actium renewed the plan to make &quot;Buthrotum&quot; a veterans&#x27; colony. New residents expanded the city and the construction included an aqueduct, a Roman bath, houses, a forum complex and a nymphaeum. During that era the size of the town was doubled. A number of new structures were built next to the existing ones especially around the theatre and the temple of Asklepeios.

In the 3rd century AD, an earthquake destroyed a large part of the town, levelling buildings in the suburbs on the Vrina Plain and in the forum of the city centre. Excavations have revealed that city had already been in decline. However, the settlement survived into the late antique era, becoming a major port in the province of Old Epirus. The town of late antiquity included the grand &quot;Triconch Palace&quot;, the house of a major local notable that was built around 425.

=== Byzantine and possible Slavic period ===
The walls of the city were extensively rebuilt, most probably at the end of the 5th century, perhaps by Byzantine Emperor Anastasius. The Ostrogoths under Indulf raided the Ionian coast in 550 and may have attacked Buthrotum. In the end of 6th century groups of Slavs possibly arrived at Buthrotum. Evidence from the excavations shows that importation of commodities, wine and oil from the Eastern Mediterranean continued into the early years of the 7th century when the early Byzantine Empire lost these provinces. During the period of Slavic invasions and population movements in the wider region Butrotum was one of the few cities in Epirus that survived and retained its status as a seat of a bishopric without interruption. 

Because of the scarcity of sources, it is difficult to assess whether Buthrotos was controlled by Slavs or Byzantines between the 7th to 10th centuries. Byzantine written sources of that time mention that Saint Elias of Enna was detained as a spy in Bouthrotos, while Arsenios of Corfu (876–953) noted the marine wealth of the town. The Grand Basilica of Buthrotum was built during the first half of the 6th century on the northeast side of the settlement. Other monuments include the Acropolic Basilica (4th century), the Triconch Palace (6th century), the Baptistery with a large, complex mosaic (6th century), the Lake Gate church (9th century) and the Baptistery church (9th century). Colonization by the Byzantine authorities seems to coincide during the reign of Leo VI (886–912). Imperial administrators of that time possibly governed the region from the &quot;oikos&quot; (, &quot;residence&quot;) from Vrina plain rather than from the citadel. Archaeological records become stronger in the 10th century.
The inventories of bishoprics from the 10th to 12th centuries identify the bishop of Butrint as subject to the metropolitan bishopric of Nafpaktos, the ecclesiastical province that took the name of the old provincial capital of Nicopolis. Arab traveller Muhammad al-Idrisi noted in the 12th century that Buthrotum is a densely populated city with a number of markets.

It remained an outpost of the Byzantine empire fending off assaults from the Normans until 1204 when following the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantine Empire fragmented, Buthrotum falling to the breakaway Despotate of Epirus. In the following centuries, the area was a site of conflict between the Byzantines, the Angevins of southern Italy, and the Venetians.

=== Between Angevins, Byzantine Empire and Despotate of Epirus ===
The fortifications were probably strengthened by Byzantine Emperor Michael I.

In 1267, Charles of Anjou took control of both Butrint and Corfu, leading to further restorations of the walls and the Grand Basilica. In 1274, Byzantine forces re-entered Butrint, an act which caused conflict between the Byzantines and the Despotate of Epirus, because Despot Nikephoros considered the site to be his domain. Despite deep religious differences between the Catholic Charles of Anjou and the staunchly Orthodox Nikephoros, the two allied against Byzantine Emperor Michael, and together drove the Byzantines from the area in 1278. Then, pressed by Charles, Nikephoros ultimately ended up recognizing Charles&#x27; rights to all the town that Michael II had awarded to Manfred of Hohenstaufen as part of his wife Helen&#x27;s dowry, as Charles was his successor, thus ceding to him Butrint as well as the entire Acroceraunian Coast from Vlora to Butrint.

=== As part of the Angevin &quot;Regnum Albaniae&quot; ===

From 1284 Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II was in control of most of today&#x27;s Albania and Angevin control on the Balkan mainland was limited to Butrinto, the later formed a single administrative unit together with nearby Corfu. In the 14th century the site shared a similar fate with Corfu. Butrint remained under Angevin rule until 1386, with only two other interruptions: in 1306, and in 1313–1331. In 1305-1306 it was controlled by the Despot of Epirus, Thomas I Komnenos Doukas. Butrint became Catholic after it was conquered by the Angevins, and remained so throughout the fourteenth century.

Hodges argues that the &quot;episodic&quot; defensive investment in Butrint as a town during this period demonstrates that it still possessed an active urban population, although not one urban dwelling had been identified at the time of writing. Hodges argues this indicates that dwellings were concentrated on the slopes of the northern citadel. The Orthodox Bishopric was transferred to nearby Glyki in 1337 or 1338. The town was reduced in size during the end of the 14th century, due to the tumultuous unrest in the region.

=== Between Venice and the Ottoman Empire ===
The dogal Republic of Venice purchased the area including Corfu from the Angevins in 1386; however, the Venetian merchants were principally interested in Corfu and Butrinto once again declined.

By 1572 the wars between Venice and the Ottoman Empire had left Butrinto ruinous and the acropolis was abandoned, while at the order of Domenico Foscarini, the Venetian commander of Corfu, the administration of Butrinto and its environs was shifted to a small triangular fortress associated with the extensive fish weirs. The area was lightly settled afterwards, occasionally being seized by the Ottoman Turks, in 1655 and 1718, before being recaptured by the Venetians. Its fisheries were a vital contributor to the supply of Corfu, and olive growing together with cattle and timber were the principal economic activities.

The Treaty of Campo Formio of 1797 split between France and Austria the territory of the Republic of Venice, which France had just occupied and abolished, and under article 5 of the treaty, Butrinto and the other former Venetian enclaves in Albania came under French sovereignty.

However, in October 1798 the city was conquered by the local Ottoman Albanian ruler Ali Pasha Tepelena, and after his death, it officially became a part of the Ottoman Empire until Albania gained its independence in 1912. By that time, the site of the original city had been unoccupied for centuries and was surrounded by malarial marshes. During Ottoman rule in Epirus, the inhabitants of Butrint displayed continuous support for Greek revolutionary activities.

=== Modern Albania ===
In 1913, after the end of the First Balkan War, Butrint was ceded to Greece but Italy challenged the decision and in the Treaty of London the region was given to the newly created Principality of Albania. As such Butrint was located near the southern border of the newly established Albanian state in a largely Greek-speaking territory. The local Greek population was enraged and created an Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus, for six months, before it was reluctantly ceded to Albania, with peace assured by Italian peacekeeping force until 1919. Italy rejected the decision because it didn&#x27;t want Greece to control both sides of the Straits of Corfu.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
=== Residential bishopric ===

In the early 6th century, Buthrotum became the seat of a bishopric and new construction included the Buthrotum baptistery, one of the largest such paleochristian buildings of its type, and a basilica. The diocese of Buthrotum was initially a suffragan of the Metropolis of Nicopolis, the metropolitan capital of Epirus Vetus and in the papal sway, but in the 9th and 10th centuries it is listed with the suffragans of Naupaktos, which succeeded ruined Nicopolis as provincial capital and metropolis of the new Byzantine theme of Nicopolis, bringing it in the sway of the Byzantine Patriarchate of Constantinople. After the 14th century, it was under the jurisdiction of the Metropolis of Ioannina.
Two of its Byzantine (pre-Eastern Schism) bishops are mentioned in extant documents: 
* Stephanus signed the joint letter of the bishops of Epirus Vetus to Emperor Leo I the Thracian in the aftermath of the killing of Patriarch Proterius of Alexandria in 458
* Matthaeus signed the synodal letter of the bishops of the province to Pope Hormisdas in 516 concerning the ordination of Metropolitan John of Nicopolis. It became a Latin Church see under Angevin and Venetian rule.

=== Latin residential bishopric ===
A Latin see was established circa 1250 under the Italian name &quot;Butrinto&quot;, functioning under Angevin and Venetian rule, but suppressed circa 1400. The 6th-century basilica was rebuilt by king Charles I of Naples in 1267.

;Known Latin bishops
* Nicola, O.P. (? – 1311.02.15)

* Giacomo, O.P. (1356.10.12 – ?)
* Lazzarino, O.F.M. (1366.02.09 – ?)

=== Catholic titular see ===
Buthrotum is today listed by the Catholic Church as a Latin titular see since the diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as titular bishopric of Buthrotum (Latin) / Butrinto (Curiate Italian) / Butrint (Albanian).

Following titular bishops have been nominated:
* Louis-Bertrand Tirilly, SS.CC. (1953.11.16 – 1966.06.21) as last Apostolic Vicar of Marquesas Islands 
* George Frendo (7. 7. 2006 – 17. 11. 2016), O.P., Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Tiranë–Durrës (Albania) (7. 7. 2006 – 17. 11. 2016), also Secretary General of Episcopal Conference of Albania (2016.05.05 – ...)
* Friar Giovanni Salonia, O.F.M. Cap., (10. 2. 2017 – resigned 27. 4. 2017) as Auxiliary Bishop of Archdiocese of Palermo
* Zdeněk Wasserbauer (* 16. 6. 1965), Auxiliary Bishop of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Prague, since 19. 5. 2018

== Archaeological excavations ==

The first modern archaeological excavations began in 1928 when the Fascist government of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy sent an expedition to Butrint. The aim was geopolitical rather than scientific, aiming to extend Italian hegemony in the area. The leader was an Italian archaeologist, Luigi Maria Ugolini who despite the political aims of his mission was a good archaeologist. Ugolini died in 1936, but the excavations continued until 1943 and the Second World War. They uncovered the Hellenistic and Roman part of the city including the &quot;Lion Gate&quot; and the &quot;Scaean Gate&quot; (named by Ugolini for the famous gate at Troy mentioned in the Homeric &quot;Iliad&quot;).

After the communist government of Enver Hoxha took Albania over in 1944, foreign archaeological missions were banned. Albanian archaeologists including Hasan Ceka continued the work. Nikita Khrushchev visited the ruins in 1959 and suggested that Hoxha should turn the area into a submarine base. The Albanian Institute of Archaeology began larger scale excavations in the 1970s. Since 1993 further major excavations have taken place led by the Butrint Foundation in collaboration with the Albanian Institute of Archaeology. Recent excavations in the western defences of the city have revealed evidence of the continued use of the walls, implying the continuation of life in the town. The walls themselves certainly seem to have burnt down in the 9th century, but were subsequently repaired.

After the collapse of the communist regime in 1992, the new democratic government planned various major developments at the site. The same year remains of Butrint were included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. A major political and economic crisis in 1997 and lobbying stopped the airport plan and UNESCO placed it on the List of World Heritage in Danger because of looting, lack of protection, management and conservation. Archaeological missions during 1994–9 uncovered further Roman villas and an early Christian church.

In 2004, archaeological excavations continued under principal investigator, David R. Hernandez.

Climate change means that the site, especially the area of the ancient theatre and Roman forum, can sometimes be covered with water, and a new management plan for both the cultural and natural assets has been implemented.

== Directions ==
The site of Butrint is accessible from Sarandë, along a road first built in 1959 for a visit by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. This road was upgraded during the summer of 2010. The construction was somewhat of an environmental disaster and may yet threaten Butrint&#x27;s World Heritage Site status. The ancient city is becoming a popular tourist destination, attracting day-trippers from the nearby Greek holiday island of Corfu. Hydrofoils (30 minutes) and ferries (90 minutes) run daily between the New Port in Corfu Town and Saranda. Many visitors from Corfu use chartered coach services to visit Butrint from Sarandë, and additionally, a regular public bus service runs between Sarandë port and Butrint. Others arrive from the Qafe Bote border crossing with Greece near Konispol and cross the Vivari Channel by the cable ferry at Butrint.

<doc id="180399" wikidata="Q4577057" url="?curid=180399" title="Television in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>Television in the Republic of Ireland is available through a variety of platforms. The digital terrestrial television service is known as Saorview and is the primary source of broadcast television since analogue transmissions ended on 24 October 2012. Digital satellite (from Sky Ireland, Saorsat and other European satellite service providers are available) and digital cable (from Virgin Media Ireland) are also widely used.

While many people receive their television via Saorview, which is broadcast by 2RN, more than half subscribe to multichannel television networks. The biggest single multichannel television network in Ireland is Sky Ireland, which broadcasts digital satellite television services. Virgin Media Ireland, Vodafone TV and Eir among others, provide similar digital television services to Irish viewers.

Television was first received in Ireland in 1949, following the opening of high-power BBC transmitters at Sutton Coldfield near Birmingham, England and later Holme Moss in West Yorkshire, England, giving marginal reception along parts of the east coast. The first transmissions on the island of Ireland began with the launch of BBC in Northern Ireland (BBC Northern Ireland) when it began broadcasting television programmes in 1953, followed in 1959 by the launch of Ulster Television (now known as UTV).

Throughout the 1950s the governments of Ireland were worried about the influences of British television and the popularity of the medium. By the end of the 1950s, 60% of the population could receive the UK&#x27;s BBC TV and ITV from spillover from Northern Ireland, Wales and the west of England. Throughout the 1950s the Irish government discussed the provision of an Irish television service; this was headed up by Leon O&#x27;Broin, the secretary of the Department of Post and Telegraphs. The Department of Post and Telegraphs had responsibility for Radio Éireann, Ireland&#x27;s radio service. In 1950 O&#x27;Broin established his own committee on Irish television and bought a television set to receive broadcasts from the BBC. The Department of Finance at this time were worried about the cost of setting up a new television service and dismissed the possibility on several occasions during the 1950s. By March 1951 O&#x27;Broin would press for the inevitable establishment of an Irish television service in the state. In a memorandum to government, the department set out four possibilities for the ownership and control of a new service:

# Owned by the state directly
# Owned by a public corporation (similar to that of the then Radio Éireann)
# Owned by private enterprise
# Having a combination where transmitters would be owned by the state and content would be provided by private enterprises

The Department of Finance was incensed with this and asked the government to tell O&#x27;Broin to resubmit the proposals through the Department of Finance according to the formal procedures of the Civil Service. John A. Costello, the Taoiseach, did so and returned the memo to the Department of Post and Telegraphs. The Minister for Finance refused to look at TV, calling it a &quot;luxury service&quot;. Through this O&#x27;Broin was able to get funding for the research he had asked for.

The public service broadcaster, Telefís Éireann, opened in 1961, followed by an additional channel RTÉ2 in November 1978. TG4 launched on 31 October 1996 as a free-to-air public service broadcaster that targets Irish language viewers.

The earliest colour broadcasts in Ireland took place in 1968. However, a full colour service was only introduced in 1973, with &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; remaining in monochrome until 1976.

On 20 September 1998, TV3 launched as the first independent commercial broadcaster in Ireland. In the 2000s television in Ireland expanded with the launch of Eir Sport 1, Bubble Hits (now defunct) and 3e (originally C6 on Cable, later added to Sky), which are available through PayTV cable and satellite services. TV3 purchased C6 and rebranded it 3e. Only with the launch of Saorview (FTA DTT) was 3e available free-to-air.

Ireland commenced its switch over to its free-to-air digital terrestrial television (DTT) in October 2010. This provided viewers with greater viewing opportunities with an increase in public service channels, i.e. of commercial services with the possibility of more public service channels from existing public service broadcaster and possibly two new channels, the Houses of the Oireachtas Channel and the Irish Film Channel, subject to finance from the government for the last two. The then Minister for Communications Pat Rabbitte aspired to have a complete DTT service rolled out by 31 December 2011.

==Regulation==

In Ireland, the Commission for Communications Regulation regulates radio wave spectrum licensing, and since 1 October 2009 the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland regulates both public service broadcasters such as RTÉ, TG4 and commercial broadcasters.

==Digital terrestrial television==

*On 17 March 2011 a public advertising campaign was launched to highlight the integration of digital terrestrial television within Ireland. Saorview, Ireland&#x27;s national free-to-air digital terrestrial television (DTT) service, launched officially to the public in May 2011. The service initially aired services provided only by RTÉ, TG4 and TV3. Additional services such as a commercial DTT service were deferred until a later date. The BAI have since ended negotiations to find a suitable service provider for such content.
*Previously, service providers for the commercial DTT varied between 2008 and 2010. Negotiations between the three key players which included Boxer, OneVision (DTT), and Easy TV were deemed unsuccessful. Both Boxer and Onevision failed to sign-off an agreement between BAI and RTÉNL. Easy TV considered its position on the license offer put to it on 29 April 2010. The Easy TV consortium informed the BAI on 12 May 2010 that it was declining their offer to pursue negotiations regarding the Commercial DTT Multiplex Licence.
* Public service channels are carried by 2RN (Under the Saorview brand), with this service operational to 90% of the country by 31 October 2010 and complete by 31 December 2011 (98%). However, publicly accessible tests of this system were available across large swathes of the country since December 2009 with further expansion since 29 October 2010 with a soft launch in Spring 2011 culminating in a hard launch before 31 December 2011 when the ASO phase began.
*The Irish system, being used by both RTÉNL and any subsequent commercial DTT provider, is a MPEG-4 DVB-T service with an MHEG-5 interactive layer.
* RTÉ Television were awarded a licence to operate a single multiplex, with a second multiplex which followed once analogue broadcasting ceased on 24 October 2012. Other services to launch on the second multiplex include additional services from TV3 such as TV3HD, TV3+1, 3Kids and 3Classics and additional channels from RTÉ such as an arts channel and music channel.
* The Broadcasting Act 2009 provided provision for the launch of two additional public services. These include an Oireachtas Channel and an Irish Film Channel. The Oireachtas TV service currently broadcasts on Saorview channel 22. The Irish Film Board will oversee operation for the Irish Film Channel.
* By 2012, SAORVIEW offered 98% coverage for all channels. This was a significant improvement in free-to-air television coverage. Similar services such as Saorview available in the United Kingdom (i.e. Freeview) and other parts of Europe are not compatible with Ireland&#x27;s DTT service. RTÉ recommends that consumers wishing to avail of the SAORVIEW service only purchase receivers that carry the SAORVIEW approved logo. In practice, most MPEG-4 DVB-T compatible equipment, such as that conforming to the UK&#x27;s Freeview HD standard, is capable of receiving SAORVIEW transmissions, albeit with some limitations to the EPG function. As the Freeview HD system is based on the newer DVB-T2 standard, SAORVIEW reception is dependent on the backward-compatibility of such devices.

===Historical testing===
DVB-T was repeatedly tested from 2RN&#x27;s Three Rock Mountain transmitter, with relatively long tests in 1998 and 2001, and shorter tests in 2004, with a single multiplex carrying the four Irish analogue terrestrial channels, and Tara Television while it was in existence, on both UHF (channel 26) and VHF (channel D). These were under temporary licences for testing, which are regularly awarded. RTÉast Networks also broadcast test DVB-T with analogue TV and radio channels from the Clermont Carn transmitter in the Cooley Mountains, County Louth with some signal bleed into Northern Ireland.

A contract to run a nationwide system, with six multiplexes from main sites, and four from relay sites was awarded in 2001 to ITS Digital Limited, led by former RTÉ executive Peter Branagan and trading as &quot;It&#x27;s TV&quot;, who intended to launch a pay TV and broadband service. ITS wanted to offer broadband internet access using the DVB-RCT standard (which while high bandwidth at up to 30 Mbit/s, is not fast enough with 20,000 people on one mast). They had no broadband licence and no viable business plan without selling broadband, and due to lack of funding withdrew its application in October 2002.

The government also planned to privatise RTÉ&#x27;s transmission network at this time but this too failed in October 2002 following the withdrawal of ITS Digital Limited DTT licence application and a number of other factors.

===Disability organisations and the switchover===
TV Access, a coalition of organisations that promote issues surrounding individuals with disabilities and senior citizens, began a campaign to highlight the switchover from analogue to digital television (DTT) broadcast services in its contribution to the Oireachtas Communications Committee heard on Wednesday, 1 April 2009.

TV Access aimed to make the wider public aware of the needs of aging and disabled viewers; they also launched a website.

Promotion for DTT roll-out began on 17 March 2011.

===Multiplex licensing process===
*The establishment of a commercial multiplex for Digital Television Terrestrial within Ireland was punctuated with many delays. The BAI (then the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland) engaged in two phases of targeted consultation to assist in the development of its DTT Multiplex Licensing Policy. These consultations ran from May to December 2007 and involved the production of a comprehensive consultation document outlining policy proposals in relation to DTT licensing and the commissioning of independent research on DTT. It was initially proposed that RTÉ Television would operate the free-to-air public service multiplex, RTÉNL would provide the relevant broadcasting technologies and a third party would provide the pay or subscription service. These third parties included Easy TV, One Vision (DTT) and Boxer. Initially, Boxer Ireland was given the licence to operate the pay DTT service. Boxer&#x27;s failure to negotiate with RTÉNL and the economic downturn in Ireland resulted in Boxer no longer holding interest in pursuing its business in Ireland. On 20 April 2009, the BAI announced that Boxer had ended negotiations on the DTT contract without a successful outcome. Following this the consortium that made up One Vision were issued the licence. Once again, One Vision failed to negotiate with RTÉNL, hence negotiations were unsuccessful. On 29 April 2010 it was announced that Onevision had pulled out of negotiations. Finally, The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland began negotiating with Easy TV (a consortium made up of RTÉ and UPC Ireland). RTÉ publicly confirmed on 14 May 2010 Easy TV was &quot;declining their offer to pursue negotiations&quot; on the DTT contract. The BAI officially confirmed Easy TV&#x27;s withdrawal and the conclusion of the current DTT licensing process on 18 May 2010.
*In July 2010, the then Minister for Communications Eamon Ryan announced that RTÉ would provide a basic free-to-air service without a pay DTT element. The free-to-air service would provide up to seven to ten channels and would roll out between 31 October 2010 to 31 December 2012. The new service would provide viewers with existing Irish channels, while also providing opportunities to expand existing channel portfolios. This service would be provided by Saorview and Saorsat the latter to be used in areas were availability to access the Saorview is limited due to geographics.

===Cross-border partnership===
On 1 February 2010 Ireland&#x27;s then-Minister for Communications Eamon Ryan signed an agreement with the UK&#x27;s Ben Bradshaw. This agreement was designed to ensure viewers within Northern Ireland could watch RTÉ One, RTÉ2 and TG4 on a free-to-air basis after the digital switchover. While initial reports suggested that BBC services would equally be made available free-to-air in the Republic of Ireland at the same time, this was not to be the case. Instead BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Two Northern Ireland were to be made available on a paid-for basis. In practice all BBC satellite channels can be received freely in the Republic of Ireland, due to overspill from the United Kingdom.

Following a broad range of technical work, the two governments agreed an effective way to provide for the continuing provision of TG4 by building a new, low power TV multiplex in Northern Ireland. In addition to carrying TG4, this multiplex, which is part of the UK DTT system, also carries RTÉ 1 and RTÉ 2. This increased the coverage of these channels in Northern Ireland, to 90% of the population in Northern Ireland to receive their services on a free-to-air basis, either through overspill as before or via the new multiplex.

The former analogue signals were switched off on a co-ordinated basis in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland on 24 October 2012.

Foreseen as part of the agreement between both governments was the establishment of a joint venture (as a not-for-profit company) between RTÉ and TG4 to run the multiplex which is licensed under the UK&#x27;s Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 by Ofcom at the request of the UK government. In addition, the licensee has put out to competitive tender all the elements of the multiplex operation which are contestable and the multiplex is operated on an open book basis.

==Mobile terrestrial television==
Mobile Terrestrial Television is TV on mobile phone handsets, which does not have contention problems compared to 3G networks.

The Commission for Communications Regulation issued its response to Consultation 08/44 about interest in multi-city mobile TV licenses that could cover up to 40% of the population that would lead to the Award of available UHF spectrum in the urban areas of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. That response to consultation was issued on Tuesday 28 July 2009. Having provided options to stakeholders in terms of 2 options outlined in Consultation 08/44 of Mobile Telegraphy Licence or a technology neutral Wireless Telegraphy Licence, and minded by the 7 responses it received, the Mobile Telegraphy Licence was seen as the best use of spectrum, given the nature of the spectrum of 8 MHz of UHF band in between 470 and 750 MHz in the five main urban areas due to the limited spectrum arising from DTT introduction and use of 4 multiplexes as the spectrum priority prior to analogue switchover (ASO).

ComReg proposed launch of the wholesale mobile TV network following licence award be rolled out within 24 months before penalty or licence withdrawal from the winner of the contest. The contest was done by comparative beauty contest instead of auction, given the nature of Mobile TV as a newish area and the risks in terms of investment inherenet in it. Given the limited spectrum a wholesale model as noted by the EU Commission reference 2 in such situation is chosen. This results in third parties having access through agreements with the wholesale mobile network operator as Other Mobile TV Service Providers (OMTSPs) in a timely, reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent manner to the network to provide their own services and electronic programme guide from up to 20 channels maximum space.

The licence would be for ten years and not automatically renewed. Those services are encrypted by the service provider to the subscriber. Contributors to the consultation 08/44 were given time to reflect on the terms suggested for the comparative beauty contest before 11 September 2009 and following that feedback and ComReg&#x27;s further reflection on that, the comparative contest guidelines were issued and an application date set by the end of the year. The winner of that contest would have two years to build the network and agree terms with Other Mobile TV Service Providers. The Broadcasting Act 2009 was also referred to in Comreg Publication 09/64.

By April 2010, following on from the response to its consultation at end of 2009 the communications regulator ComReg issued an Information Notice on the future award of a mobile television license, ComReg 10/26 Mobile TV Wireless Telegraphy Licence Award on Tuesday, 30 March 2010.

The Information Notice provided in ComReg&#x27;s plans to issue one 8 MHz frequency channel in the UHF band in the areas of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, and Waterford and invited candidates to tender for the licence in the fourth quarter of the year of 2010 and announce the licence results by the end of 2010. It weighed elements of business plans when it began the comparative process in Q4 2010. Offer of licence would have been 2011 but this was then cancelled by ComReg. International frequency co-ordination would also be ongoing during the period primarily with the UK.

Comments to ComReg&#x27;s mobile television licence proposal were taken until 30 April 2010.

By November 2010, only two responders responded to ComReg&#x27;s Television licence proposals consultation. These were RTÉNL and Vodafone Ireland. Points regarding wholesale access commitments considered critical for the successful provision of wholesale Mobile TV service and the provision of Mobile TV services for the benefits of consumers more generally were discussed. The two responders addressed points regarding automatic additional spectrum and ComReg outlined that it was minded to consider later award of mobile TV license when a national network for same would be possible of for other uses. The main concern was to whether there is demand for broadcast mobile TV, given experiences elsewhere or whether the award be made post ASO when international spectrum co-ordination is clearer. ComReg welcomed views regarding these issues from interested
parties by no later than 5.00 p.m. on 9 December 2010. It will make its decision going forward on the licence proposal following consideration of responses to this.

==Cable==
Prior to Sky Digital, cable television was the most common system for distributing multi-channel television in Ireland. With more than 40 years of history and extensive networks of both wired and &quot;wireless&quot; cable, Ireland is amongst the most cabled countries in Europe. Forty percent of Irish homes received cable television in September 2006. The figure dropped slightly in the early years of the 21st century due to the increased popularity of satellite reception, notably Sky, but has stabilised recently.

In Ireland, Virgin Media Ireland, which formerly traded under the brand names Chorus NTL and UPC Ireland, is by far the largest cable operator, almost all of the state&#x27;s cable TV operators and formerly all of the state&#x27;s MMDS licences. Virgin Media offers digital cable television services in cities and towns throughout the country (with the exception of Cork, where the network is digital-only). It offered MMDS services in rural areas until the MDS licences were withdrawn in 2016. Other than Virgin Media, the only other operators providing digital cable systems are Crossan CableComm which operates in Longford, Smyths Cablevision, which operates in Cavan, and Casey Cablevision which operates in Dungarvan, County Waterford.

==Satellite==
Direct broadcast satellite service has been available since the late 1980s with the arrival of free-to-air satellite Astra and subscription service Sky Television.

In 1988 a pan-European satellite service was launched through SES. The service provided viewers with pan-European channels which targeted the entire continent. On 5 February 1989, when Sky Television launched, British Satellite Broadcasting, which was also available in Ireland, launched in 1990 and the two merged to form British Sky Broadcasting in 1990. For most of the 1990s however, Sky&#x27;s DBS customer base in Ireland was dwarfed by the large numbers receiving its channels via cable. Sky Digital, Ireland&#x27;s first digital television service, launched in October 1998. However, in the absence of any subsidy for the Sky Digibox in Ireland – viewers in the UK could avail of both a Sky subsidy and one from British Interactive Broadcasting – the cost to initially acquire Sky Digital equipment was very expensive (IEP 450) and subscriber numbers did not rise until both these subsidies were introduced into Ireland in 2000. In 2001, UK and Irish terrestrial channels became available to Irish Sky customers for the first time.

While Sky is the biggest satellite service in Ireland, it is by no means the only satellite broadcast available. Most free to air broadcasts available in Europe are available in Ireland via the right receiver (set top box) and a dish pointed at the correct satellite. In 2008, Sat4free, an adapted version of the UK Freesat equipment, began selling in Ireland. It is a fixed NI postcode version of a Freesat receiver. Some retailers in Ireland sell actual Freesat setboxes. Both Freesat and Sat4free are superior to generic satellite receivers for the reception of UK television, only old stock of Sat4Free is now available and new purchases should be &quot;Freesat HD&quot; even if the TV set is not HDTV. Imported &quot;Grey market&quot; (as the contract the operator has doesn&#x27;t permit direct sales outside the intended Geographic area) satellite receivers are sometimes used to watch both FTA and subscription channels from visitors home countries (e.g., Cyfrowy Polsat)

Following the failure of the commercial DTT process in May 2010 RTÉ submitted a revised DTT plan including an FTA satellite option to the Dept of Communications in mid-June 2010 for approval. RTÉ publicly announced at an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications discussion in mid-July 2010 that a free-to-air satellite service, called Saorsat, would be offered to complement the terrestrial DTT service. Saorsat will enable Irish public service channels to be made available free to air and unencrypted, for the first time, as a means of covering the last 2% of the population who will be unable to receive the Saorview terrestrial service.

RTÉ said the combined offering was designed to be the most cost-effective solution for viewers and broadcasters; to offer for the first time 100% coverage of free-to-air public service television services in Ireland, and to provide full national backup coverage on satellite in the event of an emergency or catastrophic failure of the DTT system.

Approval for the revised National DTT plan and the new Saorsat satellite service was announced by the Minister for Communications at the end of July 2010.

The Saorsat satellite service has been available publicly since 3 May 2012 as tests had commenced at the end of May 2011.

==Streaming==
With over one quarter of the population viewing programming on streaming platforms, many public service broadcasters and international streaming services serve the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, some of the most popular include:

* Netflix
* Amazon Prime Video
* Apple TV+
* Walter Presents
* Disney+
* Volta

Free to access:

Republic of Ireland 
* RTÉ Player
* Virgin Media Player
* TG4 Player
* Arte
* Channel 4 (selection of on demand content only. Live TV not available)
* BBC iPlayer (Ireland version, on Sky Glass only)

Northern Ireland 
* RTÉ Player International 
* BBC iPlayer
* Channel 4
* ITVX
* My5

==Other technologies==
DVB-H
* O2 Ireland and 3 Ireland undertook trials of DVB-H. However delays in licensing broadcast spectrum to the mobile sector in Ireland forced telecoms providers such as O2 to proceed with 3G/HSDPA Mobile TV. Vodafone Ireland and 3 Ireland already have significant digital video content distributed over their 3G and 3.5G (HSDPA) networks

Virgin Media Ireland provided a wireless cable service over an all digital MMDS network reaching over 80% of the country. This network operated at 2.5 GHz to 2.7 GHz until the 18 April 2016.

The now defunct SCTV Digital provided an advanced digital television service to Cork City and parts of County Cork. It is licensed to operate all over Munster. Operating at 11.7 GHz to 12.5 GHz (MVDDS) it delivered approximately 75 digital television channels and video on demand services from &quot;Sky By Wire&quot;.

Digital satellite is the only form of subscriber satellite transmission available in the country and is provided by Sky (and Sky+ HD). The Freesat a UK service is also available in the country, as are FTA satellite channels from several other European countries.

One company provides digital television via IPTV; Magnet Entertainment.

*Magnet Networks offers viewers in Ireland the chance to view RTÉ One, RTÉ2, TV3, TG4, 3e and Dáil &amp; Seanad TV channels via the internet.

==Deflectors (UHF television programme retransmission)==

In rural areas where neither cable or direct terrestrial overspill was available, UHF television programme retransmission systems or deflectors picked up the UK terrestrial channels (either from Northern Ireland or Wales), and retransmitted them on local UHF signals along with other channels.

These operators faced legal action in the late 1990s from MMDS operators, as they did not pay royalties to the relevant broadcasters, and were not licensed. When the deflectors were shut down, there was such an outcry in those areas that an independent election candidate in County Donegal, Tom Gildea, was elected as a TD on a platform of supporting legalisation, which occurred in 1999.

Deflectors were first licensed in 1999 by the then spectrum regulator, the ODTR.
The Wireless Telegraphy (UHF Television Programme Retransmission) Regulations, 2009 were the last for deflectors, as all deflector licences expired in December 2012 due to the transition to DTT. There are few (if any) such systems still operating in Ireland.

==Television licence==

In Ireland, a television licence is required for any address at which there is a television set or device not exempted under Statutory Instrument 319 of 2009. In 2008, the annual licence fee is €160. Revenue is collected by An Post, the Irish postal service. The bulk of the fee is used to fund Raidió Teilifís Éireann, the state broadcaster. The licence must be paid for any premises that has any equipment that can potentially decode TV signals, even those that are not RTÉ&#x27;s. The licence is free to senior citizens (to anyone over the age of 70, some over 66), some Social Welfare recipients, and individuals who are blind. The fee for the licences of such beneficiaries is paid for by the state.

==Most-viewed channels (IRL)==

The channels with the largest AGB Nielsen viewing share from 2002 – 2012 are outlined in the table below:

In 2013 in the Republic of Ireland 45% of TV Viewers watch free-to-air Irish services from RTÉ, TV3 and TG4, while 10% of viewers watch the traditional Northern Irish channels UTV, BBC 1 NI, BBC 2 NI and Channel 4.

This compares to 2002 figures which show that 47% of viewers watched services from RTÉ, TV3 and TG4, while 31% watched traditional Northern Irish channels.

Irish services had an audience peak of 56% in 2006, while traditional Northern Irish services saw their audience share slide down to 19% in the same year.

Since 2002 the number of channels competing for advertising revenue has risen from 11 in 2002 to 38 in 2013. Advertising on UK services account for about 17% of all advertising revenue in Ireland. Of the 38 channels competing for advertising only 6 are Irish based.

<doc id="180412" wikidata="Q3325483" url="?curid=180412" title="Dorothy Clutterbuck">
<text>Dorothy Clutterbuck (19 January 1880 – 12 January 1951), was a wealthy Englishwoman who was named by Gerald Gardner as a leading member of the New Forest coven, a group of pagan Witches into which Gardner claimed to have been initiated in 1939. She has therefore become a figure of some significance in the history of Wicca.

Clutterbuck was a practising Anglican Christian, and never identified herself as a witch. Researchers have debated whether the surviving evidence of her own writings indicates that she had any unconventional religious leanings at all.

==Biography==
Clutterbuck was born in British India, and was the daughter of Thomas St. Quentin Clutterbuck, a British army officer. After her father&#x27;s retirement, she appears to have moved back to England and to have lived with him in the Christchurch area of the New Forest in southern England. After her father&#x27;s death, she continued to live in the same house alone, but at the age of 55 she married Rupert Fordham, a local Justice of the Peace who was of high rank in the Salvation Army. Fordham died in May 1939 in a car accident.

Clutterbuck appears to have been an outwardly respectable member of the local community, a supporter of the Conservative Party and the Church of England. She left a sizeable legacy to the local Anglican priest in her will. Her estate was valued at £60,000, a very large sum for the time. The one scandal attached to her was an allegation that Rupert Fordham was already married to a mentally ill woman, so that the two were not legally married. Clutterbuck had reverted to her maiden name by the time of her death.

==Clutterbuck and Wicca==

After her death in 1951, Clutterbuck was identified by Gerald Gardner as a leading member of the New Forest coven of witches into which he claimed to have been initiated in September 1939. Gardner referred to her only as &quot;Old Dorothy&quot; in his publications, but gave her full name to personal acquaintances. Gardner&#x27;s statements were interpreted by his pupil Doreen Valiente as implying that Clutterbuck had personally initiated him into the coven, but later authors such as Philip Heselton and Eleanor Bone claim that his initiator was in fact Edith Woodford-Grimes. Some writers, such as historian Jeffrey Russell, suggested that &quot;Old Dorothy&quot; had been invented by Gardner, but Valiente, knowing her full name, obtained her birth, marriage and death certificates and published a basic outline of her life in 1985 to prove that she really existed.

It continues to be debated whether Gardner&#x27;s claims that Clutterbuck was involved in pagan witchcraft were true, or whether Gardner used the name of a respectable local worthy as a private joke and to distract attention from his true magical partner, Edith Woodford-Grimes. Ronald Hutton and Leo Ruickbie have concluded that Clutterbuck is unlikely to have been involved in Gardner&#x27;s activities, in particular because of her apparent commitment to Christianity. Hutton also points out that the date of Gardner&#x27;s initiation would coincide with a period of mourning in 1939 when she had cancelled all other social engagements. Conversely, Philip Heselton has concluded that Clutterbuck definitely &quot;was&quot; involved in occult activities, and that her practice of Christianity was social and conventional in nature. The principal body of evidence to which both sides appeal is provided by Clutterbuck&#x27;s own diaries.

==The diaries==
Clutterbuck left three volumes of diaries, which are actually more similar to commonplace books, filled with daily poems and illustrations and intended to be read by visitors to her home.

The researchers Ronald Hutton and Philip Heselton have both read Clutterbuck&#x27;s diaries, and have come to entirely different conclusions on their contents. Hutton believes that Clutterbuck&#x27;s poems show her to be a &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;kindly&quot; woman with no connections with paganism or the occult. Heselton, on the other hand, believes that her writings reveal that &quot;Dorothy was a pagan in all but name.&quot;

The evidence cited by Heselton and his supporters consists both of the absence of overt Christian themes and the apparent presence of pagan sentiments. Heselton notes that &quot;there is hardly a mention of Jesus and it seems as if her deepest spiritual experiences come from nature and, particularly, her garden.&quot; Little Christian sentiment is expressed, even on Christian holidays. Of the few direct references to Christianity, this for Whit Sunday 1942 is characteristically oblique:
:&quot;The Sunday that comes in the time of the May
:With its crown of white blossoms for this sacred day
:The Essence of this Day – The Spirit of Prayer
:Brings to us those loved Spirits who used to be here&quot;
&quot;Midsummer,&quot; Heselton says &quot;is lauded as &#x27;the day of all days most dear&#x27;&quot;. Nature and the feelings of magical enchantment that come from it are commonly repeated themes, as is the theme of a fairy-like dancing maiden, often referred to as &#x27;the Queen&#x27;, who seems to personify the seasons and the land. For example:
:&quot;... I knew you were a vision
:The loveliest ever seen
:But I also knew that you were Real
:And of my heart, the Queen.&quot;

:&quot;I am waiting for my Lady
:For, down the pathway shadey
:I think I hear her footfall light
:My heart beats wildly with delight
:I cannot wait – the minutes drag
:Just when I&#x27;m in despair
:Dear Heaven! She is coming! And now She&#x27;s here! She&#x27;s here!&quot;

:&quot;Of all the Ladies that I know
:There&#x27;s only one can please me so
:That all her Looks and all her Ways
:Make Music for me all my Days.
:For Life, I love her, and adore
:I only saw her once – not more
:But once I saw her, as I say
:But once she crossed my Path, my Way
:For Ever. She will be my Queen
:Where did I see her? – in a Dream.&quot;

The diaries also contain frequent references to fairies and the full moon; bits of herb-lore, and occasionally vivid descriptions of classical gods such as Aurora.
Other examples seem more ambiguous, and could equally express Christian or Pagan sentiment, or simple poetic metaphor:
:&quot;Then with a flash of Scarlet
:Sweeping across the snows
:Comes Christmas, Radiant Creature!
:She&#x27;s laughing as she goes. The shining holly fills her lap
:Blue pages hold her train
:Dear Time of lovely memories. So here you are again
:There stand the glittering Christmas Trees
:The Fires flame and glow
:Soft fingers tapping on the pane
:Are fairies, made of snow
:The Bells ring out, The Carols mount
:All the old songs are dear
:The First Most Sacred Festival
:The best of all the year&quot;

<text>The Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery is a Jewish cemetery in Culver City, California, United States. Many Jewish people from the entertainment industry are buried there. The cemetery is known for Al Jolson&#x27;s elaborate tomb (designed by Los Angeles architect Paul Williams), a 75-foot-high pergola and monument atop a hill above a water cascade, all visible from the adjacent San Diego Freeway.

==History==
Built on 35 acres of rolling hills in an undeveloped area near Inglewood, the cemetery was originally founded as B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Memorial Park in 1941 by Lazare F. Bernhard and Robert S. and Harry Groman, founders of Groman Mortuaries in 1936 and sons of Charles Groman, who co-founded the first licensed Jewish mortuary west of Chicago, Glasband-Groman-Glasband, before it was renamed &quot;Hillside Memorial Park&quot; in 1942. Because of objections by the Inglewood Chamber of Commerce, they were not granted a permit to operate by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors until July 1943.

In 1951 the park became famous when Al Jolson&#x27;s widow, Erle, purchased a large plot and had erected a 75-foot-high domed monument in his memory. Thousands attended the dedication and service, which included a eulogy by Jack Benny.

After a bitter legal dispute between the Groman brothers, and Robert&#x27;s death in 1957, the park was acquired by Temple Israel of Hollywood, which continues to own and operate it.

Jack Benny&#x27;s funeral in 1974 included a eulogy by Bob Hope and was attended by over 2000 people, including dozens of well-known members of the entertainment community. Major figures in the worlds of philanthropy, women&#x27;s rights, law, education, medicine and religion are interred at Hillside, some of whom are listed below.

<text>Forest Lawn Memorial Park is a privately owned cemetery in Glendale, California, United States. It is the original and current flagship location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks &amp; Mortuaries, a chain of six cemeteries and four additional mortuaries in Southern California.

==History==
Forest Lawn Memorial Park was founded in 1906 as a not-for-profit cemetery by a group of businessmen from San Francisco. Hubert Eaton and C.B. Sims entered into a sales contract with the cemetery in 1912. Eaton took over its management in 1917. Although Eaton did not start Forest Lawn, he is credited as its &quot;Founder&quot; for his innovations of establishing the &quot;memorial-park plan&quot;. He eliminated upright grave markers and brought in works by established artists. He was the first to open a funeral home on dedicated cemetery grounds. He was a firm believer in a joyous life after death.

Convinced that most cemeteries were &quot;unsightly, depressing stoneyards,&quot; he pledged to create one that would reflect his optimistic Christian beliefs, &quot;as unlike other cemeteries as sunshine is unlike darkness.&quot; He envisioned Forest Lawn as &quot;a great park devoid of misshapen monuments and other signs of earthly death, but filled with towering trees, sweeping lawns, splashing fountains, beautiful statuary, and memorial architecture.&quot; A number of plaques stating Eaton&#x27;s intentions are signed &quot;The Builder.&quot; Frederick Llewellyn, Eaton&#x27;s nephew, became CEO of Forest Lawn in 1966. In 1987, he was succeeded by his son, John Llewellyn, who died in April 2022.

Most of Forest Lawn&#x27;s burial sections have evocative names, including Eventide, Babyland (for infants, shaped like a heart), Graceland, Inspiration Slope, Slumberland (for children and adolescents), Sweet Memories, Whispering Pines, Vesperland, Borderland (on the edge of the cemetery), and Dawn of Tomorrow.

Forest Lawn originally participated in racial segregation and &quot;for decades refused entrance to blacks, Jews, and Chinese&quot;.

==Forest Lawn Museum==
The Forest Lawn Museum in Glendale opened in 1952 and is located next to the Hall of Crucifixion-Resurrection. It rotates art exhibitions twice yearly, and has hosted solo exhibitions for Henri Matisse, Winslow Homer, Ian Hornak, Francisco Goya, Rembrandt and Marc Davis. In 2021, it held an exhibition on Judson Studios, the oldest family-run stained glass studio in the United States, which produced numerous stained glass windows for Forest Lawn in the Hall of Crucifixion-Resurrection and the Great Mausoleum.

Forest Lawn Museum&#x27;s art collection consists primarily of original bronze and marble sculptures by European and American artists. The permanent collection also includes stained glass that used to be part of William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s collection. Forest Lawn purchased the stained glass works in 1954. The windows date from c. 1315 to 1575, and display impressive examples of French, German, and Austrian craftsmanship in Gothic and Renaissance styles.

=== &quot;Song of the Angels&quot; ===
One of the most famous objects in the Forest Lawn Museum&#x27;s permanent collection is an oil painting titled &quot;Song of the Angels&quot; by French artist William Bouguereau (1825–1905), who painted the artwork in 1881. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, as well as in Rome, and was considered a leading French academic painter in the nineteenth century. Legend has it that Bouguereau searched for a model for the painting&#x27;s figures and found them in his first wife, Nelly Monochablon, who posed for the angels, one by one, and at last, with a child in her arms. The painting shows a mother and child, calmly asleep in a pastoral setting, while a trio of angels hovers nearby. It highlights Bouguereau&#x27;s ability to render realistic flesh tones and subtle gradations of white.

&quot;Song of the Angels&quot; was once a part of the Wanamaker Collection in Philadelphia. It was acquired by Forest Lawn Memorial Park in 1940 for a chapel in the Church of the Recessional. Originally, a stained-glass window was going to be the focal point of the chapel, but instead Forest Lawn decided to purchase the painting from Schnittjer&#x27;s gallery. A large gothic-style liturgical frame was built for the painting by Forest Lawn craftsmen, and it is still presented in this wooden frame at the Forest Lawn Museum.

In 2005, the painting traveled to the Getty Center in Los Angeles for a cleaning with funding from the Conservation Partnership Program. Chief Paintings Conservator, Mark Leonard, worked on the painting for months to remove the old varnish and restore its original colors. &quot;Song of the Angels&quot; was exhibited at the Getty Center, alongside a preparatory oil sketch and a later, half-size replica from Bouguereau&#x27;s own hand.

==Statuary and art==


=== The Court of David ===
The Court of David at Forest Lawn-Glendale is located right before the Mystery of Life garden on Cathedral Drive and is centered around a seventeen-foot-tall replica statue of Michelangelo Buonarroti&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;. The first Forest Lawn replica of &quot;David&quot; was installed at Forest Lawn on June 22, 1939. The statue was placed using a series of ropes and pulleys. The statue fell due to seismic activity in 1971. The head and right foot of the 1939 replica is on display at the Forest Lawn Museum. Later Forest Lawn copies fell in 1994 and 2020. A new bronze replica of &quot;David&quot; was installed at Forest Lawn-Glendale in 2021.

The architectural inspiration for the Court of David is the Piazzale Michelangelo, a square in Florence, Italy dedicated to Michelangelo. Like the Court of David, the Piazzale Michelangelo is an open-air space that features a bronze replica of &quot;David&quot; in the center&quot;.&quot;

=== The Court of Freedom ===
The Court of Freedom is long and wide. It is enclosed on three sides by high walls and is open to the side that parallels the drive. The central point of the court is the mosaic rendition of John Trumbull&#x27;s &quot;Signing of the Declaration of Independence.&quot; The mosaic measures at by . It is three times the size of the original painting in the United States Capitol Rotunda in Washington, D.C. The mosaic consists of 700,000 pieces of Venetian glass in more than 1,500 colors. It was made in Italy expressly for Forest Lawn. There are two fifty-foot white pylons on each end of the court.

The left pylon displays a replica of &quot;The Republic&quot; by Daniel Chester French. The original work was displayed at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893. The Forest Lawn version is -tall and is one of two later originals, the other having been Commissioned for the Siegel-Cooper Big Store in Manhattan&#x27;s Ladies&#x27; Mile in 1896. The figure holds a globe surmounted by an American eagle and clasps the staff of liberty crowned with a laurel wreath of honor. The right pylon displays an original statue of George Washington by John Quincy Adams Ward. This statue had been commissioned by the U.S. Congress, but no appropriation was made to pay for it, so it was purchased by Forest Lawn.
=== &quot;Christus&quot; ===
Before the beginning of World War II in 1939, Forest Lawn commissioned a reproduction of &quot;Christus,&quot; an eleven-foot tall marble sculpture by Bertel Thorvaldsen (1770–1884). The original stands in the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen, Denmark. The first small reproduction was received in 1925 and a larger reproduction was completed in 1940 and unveiled in 1946. A second small yellow copy was received in 1947. The Court of The Christus is placed above a waterfall between the Garden of Remembrance and the Garden of Memory.

==Great Mausoleum==
The Great Mausoleum features eleven terraces and over 100 stained glass windows. The massive building, which contains the same amount of steel and concrete as a 70-story skyscraper, embodies an eclectic mix of architectural styles, and is the park&#x27;s artistic centerpiece.

The mausoleum&#x27;s original architect was T. Paterson Ross. Numerous other people worked on it, and the construction designs underwent several rounds of changes. Construction began in 1917, and it was officially inaugurated in 1920. Construction finished only in the 1970s.

The Memorial Terrace was added in the late 1920s, and the Memorial Court of Honor was inaugurated in 1931. The gallery&#x27;s largest piece is the Last Supper stained glass window by Rosa Caselli-Moretti and her sister, Cecilia Caselli-Moretti. This monumental project took over six years to complete. It was created in the sisters&#x27; studio in Perugia, Italy, and shipped to Glendale, where it was formally dedicated on April 28, 1931.

Commissioned expressly for the Memorial Court of Honor are the replicas of the seven Michelangelo sculptures including the Pietà. The Memorial Court of Honor is the only place in the world where exceptional marble reproductions of all of Michelangelo&#x27;s most renowned statues can be viewed in one location. One of the mausoleum&#x27;s last building phases incorporated French Gothic architecture with lofty ceilings and large stained-glass windows, creating an ethereal and tranquil space.

== Churches at Forest Lawn ==

=== Wee Kirk o&#x27; the Heather ===
Wee Kirk o&#x27; the Heather is the second church built at Forest Lawn. The inspiration for the church was based on the village church (kirk) at Glencairn, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. This village church was erected in 1310 and subsequently destroyed in 1805. Dumfriesshire is rich in historical tradition, and it is most known for being where Sir Walter Scott wrote some of his most famous works, and former home of the famed poet, Robert Burns. The love song &quot;Annie Laurie&quot; is perhaps Scotland&#x27;s most popular love ballad. It immortalizes the ill-fated romance of a woman that lived near the original &quot;wee kirk&quot; in the Glencairn.

The song was written by William Douglas of Fingland, a soldier in the Royal Scots Army. Annie Laurie was born at Maxwelton House in 1682, the daughter of Sir Robert Laurie, a baronet. Traditionally, it is believed that Annie&#x27;s aristocratic family would not consent to her marrying an older soldier of an opposing clan.

This evocative ballad is portrayed in eight beautiful stained glass windows along the south side of the Wee Kirk at Forest Lawn. Artifacts related to Annie including communion coins, will, and portrait are all housed in the historical room at the Wee Kirk. The Wee Kirk church was dedicated on October 6, 1929. Over five thousand people attended the ceremony, and Frank McWilliams, Scottish tenor, sang &quot;Annie Laurie.&quot;

In the forecourt of the Wee Kirk is a &quot;Wishing Chair.&quot; Built in 1931, of stones from the original kirk at Glencairn, Scotland, legend has it that lovers who sit and speak the words inscribed on the chair will be forever blessed.

=== Little Church of the Flowers ===
The Little Church of the Flowers was the first church to be built at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. The architect was T. Patterson Ross. Ross&#x27;s inspiration was an English village church at Stoke Poges in Buckinghamshire, where the poet Thomas Gray had written &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,&quot; a famous English poem. Ross wanted to recreate the 600-plus-year-old parish church at Forest Lawn. He began his commission in 1917.

The conservatories adjacent to the pews, filled with flowers, was added later on in the construction. The dedication ceremony took place on Mother&#x27;s Day, May 12, 1918. At the end of the nave is a &quot;Tree of Life Window.&quot; The design of the window was created by a long-forgotten monk in an English Abbey. It was then translated into a stained glass medium.

=== Church of the Recessional ===
The Church of the Recessional was the third church built at Forest Lawn. The architectural inspiration was the Church of St. Margaret in Rottingdean, Sussex, England, an Anglo-Saxon-styled stone and stained glass edifice dating from 1100 A.D. that is still standing. The dedication ceremony took place on November 30, 1941. Within the chancel are three stained glass windows depicting scenes of the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child.

The stained glass windows were produced by Charles J. Connick. Along both sides of the chancel arch, the pulpit and the baptismal font of St. Margaret&#x27;s have been faithfully reproduced. Over the arch are the words of Apostle Paul, &quot;Now abideth faith, hope, and love, these three; and the greatest of these is love.&quot; Along the south side of the church are stained glass windows that depict the Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount.

In the forecourt of the church stands the romantic Ring of Aldyth, to which an Old Saxon legend attaches a prophecy of happiness and devotion for a couple who clasp their right hands through the ring and repeat together the inscribed vows: &quot;Thy hand in mine, this ring doth bind, my heart to thine.&quot;

== Hall of Crucifixion–Resurrection ==
Built with the intention to house the enormous painting by Jan Styka, &quot;The Crucifixion;&quot; the design for the Hall of Crucifixion-Resurrection was inspired by the cathedral in Orvieto, Italy. The architectural style of the hall is Gothic. Covering the painting are a pair of gigantic curtains that weigh , measure long by high, and are carried on a custom-built set of tracks.

The hall was completed in three years, and the dedication ceremony took place on Good Friday, March 23, 1951. It even was the subject of an in-depth article in the March 23, 1955, issue of &quot;Southwest Builder &amp; Contractor Magazine,&quot; which characterized the hall as:

&quot;The new structure is not a church or chapel, and will not be used for funeral or wedding ceremonies. It is purely an auditorium for the reverential viewing of Styka&#x27;s masterpiece...In order that the true perspective of the entire length of the picture may be had by persons sitting on the one thousand seats on the auditorium floor, the wall upon which the painting has been mounted is slightly curved concave to the audience.&quot; The painting has been shown daily in an audio-visual presentation since the dedication ceremonies.

The painting has an elaborate and interesting history. &quot;The Crucifixion&quot;  was brought by the artist, Jan Styka, to the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis. When the fair ended, he was unable to pay the export duty and was forced to return to Poland without it.  Styka, whose self-portrait is seen in the painting as the figure of Saul (Paul), died in 1925 without ever seeing his painting again. The  Crucifixion was wrapped around a telephone pole and stored in several warehouses over the years until it was rediscovered at the Chicago Civic Opera company in 1943. Forest Lawn purchased the painting after World War II  for the express purpose of displaying it to the public.

== Critical commentary ==
The most notable critical work about Forest Lawn is &quot;The Loved One&quot; by Evelyn Waugh, an English writer. Waugh was given a tour of Forest Lawn, which is when he was inspired with the idea for the book. A 1948 &quot;New York Times&quot; review wrote that it is &quot;satire at its most ferocious...a macabre frolic filled with... ingenious devices.&quot;

The singer Tom Paxton wrote and recorded a satirical song, &quot;Forest Lawn&quot;, which featured on his 1970 album &quot;Tom Paxton 6&quot; (Elektra Records).

<text>Forest Lawn Memorial Park – Hollywood Hills is one of the six Forest Lawn cemeteries in Southern California. It is located at 6300 Forest Lawn Drive in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles.

== History ==
The first Forest Lawn, in Glendale, was founded in 1906 by businessmen who, 6 years later, hired Dr. Hubert Eaton, a firm believer in a joyous life after death. He believed that most cemeteries were &quot;unsightly stone yards&quot;, and pledged to create one that would reflect his optimistic beliefs and be &quot;as different, as unlike other cemeteries as sunshine is to darkness, as eternal life is unlike death.&quot; He stated &quot;I shall try to build at Forest Lawn a great park, devoid of misshapen monuments and other customary signs of Earthly death, but filled with towering trees, sweeping lawns, splashing fountains, singing birds, beautiful statuary, cheerful flowers, noble memorial architecture with interiors full of light and color, and redolent of the world&#x27;s best history and romances.&quot;

Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills is the second oldest of the Forest Lawn cemetery properties.

By 1946, Forest Lawn at Glendale had bought some of land which had been known as the Lasky Ranch, the Providencia Ranch, which had a house and outbuildings, including stables and corrals, and part of the Hudkins Ranch, also known as the Old Lasky Ranch. The Lasky Ranch had been used as a film location since the early 1910s, and films made there included &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) and several of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s early comedies, including &quot;Sunnyside&quot; (1919). The Old Lasky Ranch had also been used for filming many movies, and Warner Brothers had leased it in 1929. D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915) had been largely filmed on the Providencia Ranch.

In 1950, after a four-year permit process, Hubert Eaton began construction of a new cemetery on his land at Hollywood Hills. A curving and irregular road, laid out by 1951 among the rolling green hills, gave a rural effect in the heart of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The first buildings, a mortuary, an office, a garage, and a maintenance warehouse, were also built in 1951, and the new cemetery was opened for burials on March 4, 1952.

Part of a mausoleum called the Court of Remembrance was constructed in 1957.

==Features==

===Court of Liberty===

* The Court of Liberty features statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and the &quot;Birth of Liberty&quot; mosaic. At long and high, &quot;Birth of Liberty&quot; is the largest historical mosaic in the United States. It is composed of ten million pieces of Venetian glass and depicts twenty-five scenes from early America, from 1619 to 1787.
* The Old North Church, a precise replica of Boston&#x27;s historic church, from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s poem &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot;. The historical rooms have documents and mementos of the colonial period.
* The Hall of Liberty American History Museum has a copy of the Liberty Bell and other exhibits. The museum has a 1,200-seat auditorium.
* Monument to Washington, a marble and bronze tribute to America&#x27;s first president, created by sculptor Thomas Ball. Four of Washington&#x27;s generals are honored in the memorial.

===Lincoln Terrace===
* The Lincoln Terrace features a bronze statue of the Abraham Lincoln, 16th president, by Augustus St. Gaudens. It is also flanked by a panoramic mosaic depicting key scenes from Lincoln&#x27;s life.

===Plaza of Mesoamerican Heritage===

The Plaza of Mesoamerican Heritage had indigenous/non-Christian sculptures by Meliton Salas Rodriguez, of Guadalajara, Mexico. Salas used hand tools to first quarry, then work, the native Mexican stone into precisely scaled, detailed replicas of artwork and artifacts that are representative of the Aztec, Huastec, Maya, Mixtec, Olmec, Teotihuacan, Toltec, Totonac, and Zapotec civilizations that preceded both Spanish colonialism and modern Mexican culture. The Plaza stood in contrast to the Christian and patriotic American themes which were originally reflective of the culture at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills and other Forest Lawn Memorial Parks since their inception by Christian American businessman Hubert L. Eaton. A smooth Olmecan head, an intricate Aztec sun calendar and a sinuous Teotihuacan bas relief were some of the sculptural features of the plaza that were set off by crushed stone walkways and complemented by groupings of Mesoamerican plants.

The entire display, however, has been removed and placed in storage.

<doc id="180421" wikidata="Q6923684" url="?curid=180421" title="Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery">
<text>Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery is the largest Jewish mortuary and Jewish cemetery organization, located in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of the central region of Los Angeles, California. Many notable Jewish people from the American entertainment and arts industry are buried here. 

== History ==
Mount Sinai Memorial Parks and Mortuaries, owned by Sinai Temple of Los Angeles, refers to a Jewish mortuary and two Jewish cemeteries in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The original cemetery property is located at 5950 Forest Lawn Drive in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles. The cemetery was originally established in 1953 by the neighboring Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills Cemetery. In 1959, it became an exclusively Jewish cemetery, and in 1967 it was acquired by Sinai Temple, the oldest and largest Conservative synagogue in Los Angeles, which dedicated its mortuary and cemetery resources to all members of the Jewish community in and around the city. Numerous stars and celebrities from the entertainment industry are interred in the park, which is located down the street from Warner Bros studios.

== Artwork ==

Throughout the different sections of Mount Sinai Hollywood Hills, one encounters various forms of artwork including mosaics, sculpture, fountains and carvings. The art displayed at the Parks provides an opportunity for Jews who may have grown distant from their heritage to re-acquaint themselves with their roots.

== Gardens of Heritage- Heritage Mosaic ==
The most noticeable artwork is the Heritage Mosaic located at Mount Sinai&#x27;s Hollywood Hills location, which, at , depicts a panorama of the Jewish experience in America and is made up of more than 2.5 million pieces of hand-cut Venetian glass. 

The artwork begins with the arrival of a small group of Jews in Nieuw Amsterdam in 1654 and continues with highlights of American Jewish history up to the time of the founding of the State of Israel. 

The Gardens of Heritage was dedicated in September 1984, after several years of design and construction. The mosaic has also served as an educational tool for visitors to learn about the story of Jewish settlement and accomplishments in the United States.

== The Warsaw Ghetto Memorial ==
The park also features a memorial monument by renowned Jewish artist Bernard Zakheim. The memorial is dedicated to the six million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. Six three-dimensional figures, all rendered in burnt and tortured wood, represent six heroic Jewish figures: those who resisted partisan fighters, a woman warrior, the schoolgirls who martyred themselves, a scholar and a child who could not resist, and one figure that stands for those who went passively to their deaths.

At Yom HaShoah commemorations, memorial candles are lit in front of plaques bearing the names of concentration camps.

Rising from the stones of the memorial is a flame that symbolizes the eternal spirit of the six million and the rebirth of Israel from the ashes of the Holocaust.

== The Bet Alpha Synagogue Mosaic ==
When this 6th century (Byzantine period) Galilean synagogue was excavated, a cavity in the floor of its apse, which almost certainly served as a genizah, was uncovered; an Ark for the Torah Scrolls stood above it.

The central decorative feature of the Bet Alpha synagogue was its mosaic floor, reproduced in the Shemot Plaza by members of Kibbutz Eylon in the Galilee at five times its original size, using about four million tesserae. The 12 signs of the Zodiac are arranged in a circular pattern around a cover at the center that accesses the genizah below.

Art historian Michael Ave-Yonah comments on the Bet Alpha mosaic: &quot;The simple but strong style of the mosaic pavement represents a folk art that appears to have developed among the Jewish villagers of Galilee. The figures are depicted frontally and the artist took great pains to make each scene expressive. The mosaics of Bet Alpha are striking in their coloring and stylization and are among the finest examples of Jewish art in the Byzantine period.&quot;

== Expansion to Simi Valley, California==
In 1997, faced with dwindling space at the original Hollywood Hills location and recognizing the need for Jewish burial properties for future generations, Mount Sinai Memorial Parks expanded by opening its second memorial park, Mount Sinai Simi Valley.

== Simi Valley Green Burial Park- Teva ==

In 2024 Mount Sinai Memorial Parks and Mortuaries was certified by the Green Burial Council as both a green funeral home and a provider of green burial services.

The Green Burial Council provides national certification for both funeral homes and cemeteries that provide environmentally conscious options for burial and disposition. Green burial has steadily grown in popularity over the past two decades, reflecting the community&#x27;s desire for more natural disposition methods.

Joe Sehee, founder of the Green Burial Council explained, &quot;Green burial is a way of caring for the dead with minimal environmental impact that aids in the conservation of natural resources, reduction of carbon emissions, protection of worker health and the restoration and preservation of habitat.&quot;

With this certification, Mount Sinai Memorial Parks and Mortuaries becomes part of a national network of green burial providers. 

Teva at Mount Sinai Simi Valley is located near Kamenir Chapel, overlooking a protected nature reserve, this beautifully tranquil area is reached by a meandering stone path. Along the path are olive and pine trees, stone walls, and handcrafted wooden benches that create a protected space that envelopes visitors in shaded comfort and peace.

Teva&#x27;s burials only use natural, sustainably sourced containers made of wicker or wood, or a natural fiber shroud that is fully biodegradable. There are no concrete vaults or liners placed in the interment space. The green burial area is planted with drought tolerant, native California plants that reflect the hillsides and areas that surround the park. In addition, a special strain of drought tolerant grass and decomposed granite covers the ground areas.

As part of their land stewardship, graves at Mount Sinai&#x27;s natural burial sites are not marked with bronze markers. Instead, a natural engraved stone marker commemorates loved ones, and is included in the purchase of every space in the Natural Burial area.

== Genizah and book burials==
Mount Sinai offers a Genizah program where members of the community can drop off worn out siddurim (prayer books), Torah scrolls, tallit, tzitzit, tefellin and other sacred materials which contain the Hebrew name of God, for burial at a later date. Several times each year, Mount Sinai invites school groups to Mount Sinai Simi Valley, where they will conduct a burial service for the books while learning about this ancient Jewish tradition.

<text>Inglewood Park Cemetery, in Inglewood, California, was founded in 1905. A number of notable people, including entertainment and sports personalities, have been interred or entombed there.
==History==


The proposed establishment of &quot;the largest cemetery in the world&quot; was announced in November 1905, to be &quot;on a high strip of ground two miles southwest of Los Angeles&quot;.

In 1907, a &quot;handsome, two-story, white granite chapel&quot; was completed at a cost of &quot;about $40,000&quot;.

Also in 1907 the management placed an order &quot;with the factory in the East&quot; for a $12,000 funeral car to be used &quot;on the electric line&quot; that ran on a right-of-way off Redondo Boulevard (today&#x27;s Florence Avenue) in front of the cemetery.

Between 1928 and 1948 Inglewood Park advertised itself as the &quot;Largest in California,&quot; with a mausoleum, cemetery, and columbarium. From 1948 through 1950 it said it had the &quot;Greatest number of interments in the West&quot;.

===Organizers and directors===

Early backers of the Inglewood Cemetery Association were Senator Robert N. Bulla, Mark G. Jones, Robert H. Raphael, Tom Hughes, P.W. Powers, Byron Oliver, B.J. or V.J. Rowan, F.K. Eckley, C.B. Hopper, Harry M. Jack, John R. Powers, George Letteau, Jennie Wild, and Will G. Nevin. Others were P.W. Powers and D.S. Patterson.

In 1907 the directors were Mark G. Jones, F.K. Eckley, Robt. N. Bulls, John C. Rupp, Robt. H. Raphael, Geo. H. Letteau, and Chas. B. Hopper. The officers were Mark G. Jones, president and treasurer; Chas. B. Hopper, vice-president; F.K. Eckley, secretary; V.J. Rowan, engineer, and Captain L.G. Loomis, superintendent.

===Early burials===

One of the earliest notable burials was that of Webster Street, justice of the Supreme Court of Arizona between 
1897 and 1900, on September 23, 1908.

Another was the September 12, 1908, funeral of Los Angeles city Police Chief Walter H. Auble, who was shot and killed in the line of duty. Thousands came from Los Angeles on carriages and aboard special Los Angeles Railway streetcars.

<text>Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery is a cemetery located at 10621 Victory Boulevard, straddling the border between the Los Angeles neighborhood of North Hollywood and Burbank, California.

The cemetery&#x27;s East entrance features the Portal of the Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation, the final resting place for aviation pioneers — &quot;barnstormers, daredevils and sundry architects of aviation&quot;. The cemetery is just to the south of Hollywood Burbank Airport. It has memorials to Amelia Earhart and others, honoring their accomplishments. The portal features colorful tiled dome and female figures stretching their arms to the heavens. The cemetery was named &quot;Valhalla&quot; for the hall of slain warriors presided over by Odin, the Norse god of war and death, amongst other associations.

Among those interred in Valhalla are celebrities from the entertainment industry.

== Founding ==
Valhalla was founded in 1923 by Los Angeles financiers John R. Osborne and C. C. Fitzpatrick. The Spanish Mission Revival entrance structure was designed by architect Kenneth McDonald Jr. For the decorative stone castings, McDonald hired Italian-born sculptor Federico A. Giorgi, who had created statues of elephants and lions for the 1916 epic film &quot;Intolerance&quot;, and helped to craft the exterior of downtown&#x27;s Million Dollar Theater. The gateway to the new cemetery cost $140,000.

The rotunda was dedicated March 1, 1925, with a concert by English contralto Maude Elliott. Picnickers spread blankets on the surrounding grassy expanse between three reflecting pools and flat cemetery markers, which were a new concept at the time. It became a tourist attraction and was used for concerts that were broadcast over radio station KELW by station owner Earl L. White. Just five months after the dedication, Osborne and Fitzpatrick were convicted of fraud. They had repeatedly sold the same burial plots—as many as 16 times—and netted a profit of $3–4 million, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. They were fined $12,000 each and sentenced to 10 years in prison, but served less than three years.

==State control==

The cemetery was taken over by the state of California. It is unclear how long the state owned the cemetery, but Pierce Brothers bought it in 1950 and, within two years, closed the rotunda to vehicle traffic and moved the entry to the cemetery from Valhalla Drive in Burbank to Victory and Cahuenga boulevards in North Hollywood. There, they opened a two-story office building and mortuary.

On December 17, 1953—the 50th anniversary of Orville and Wilbur Wright&#x27;s 12-second powered hop at Kitty Hawk—the rotunda was rededicated as the Portal of the Folded Wings, through the efforts of aviation fan and cemetery employee James Gillette. During the ceremony, the cremated remains of Walter R. Brookins, the first aviator to take a plane to an altitude of a mile and the Wright brothers&#x27; first civilian student, were interred.

When sculptor Giorgi died in 1963, he was buried outside the structure, near his masterpiece. Gillette was also buried outside, near the shrine he helped found.
The memorial was featured in &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot; Episode 426.

==Earthquake==
The cube-like shrine building was heavily damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake but restored and rededicated in 1996. Two years later, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Sale of property==

In 1958, Pierce Brothers sold its family-owned chain of Southern California mortuaries and cemeteries to Texas financier Joe Allbritton, who sold of Valhalla for development. In 1991, the cemeteries and mortuaries were acquired by Service Corp. International of Houston, but the Pierce Brothers sign remains at Valhalla.

==Pioneers&#x27; resting place==
Beneath the memorial tablets rest the remains of other aviation pioneers, including:
* Augustus Roy Knabenshue (1876–1960), who in 1904 became America&#x27;s first dirigible pilot. He also founded a dirigible passenger service, from Pasadena to Los Angeles, in 1912.
* Evelyn &quot;Bobbi&quot; Trout (1906–2003), who held numerous records for endurance, mileage and altitude.
* James Floyd Smith (1884–1956), who built and flew his own plane in 1912 and invented the free-type manually operated parachute for the Army in 1918.
* Hilder Florentina Smith (1890–1977), who became a parachute jumper in 1914. Two years later, she became the first female pilot to fly out of the bean patch that later became Los Angeles International Airport. She was married to James Floyd Smith.
* Matilde Moisant, the second American woman to earn her pilot certificate—two days after her friend, journalist Harriet Quimby. In 1911, Moisant let Quimby be first, because Quimby needed the extra acclaim: She wrote about air races and the thrill of flight.
* John B. Moisant (1868–1910), who designed and built the first metal plane. Matilde Moisant was his sister.

<text>The Club des Hashischins (sometimes also spelled Club des Hashishins or Club des Hachichins, &quot;Club of the Hashish-Eaters&quot;) was a Parisian group dedicated to the exploration of drug-induced experiences, notably with hashish. Members included Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Charles Baudelaire, Gérard de Nerval and Honoré de Balzac.

==Background==

The Club was started as a research experiment. Unknown members included Charles Baudelaires lover Black Venus, the owner of the Hotel Lauzun (Pimodan) Jerome Pichon, Fernand Broissard who hosted the initial events in his room, and Louis-Remy Aubert Roche who worked with Jacques Joseph Moreau growing cannabis on the grounds of Bicetre Mental Asylum. This information along with the first full detailed history of the house, the members, the background story was published in &quot;The Assassins Club&quot; by Author Roach in 2024. 

Several drugs like hashish and opium were increasingly well known in Europe by the beginning of the nineteenth century. At that time, recreational use of these drugs was widespread among scientific and literary circles.

The Armée d&#x27;Orient, along with a contingent of 151 scientists and anthropologists from the Commission des Sciences et des Arts, brought quantities of hashish home with them from Napoleon&#x27;s expedition to Egypt. The French conquest of Algeria of 1830 to 1847 further increased the popular consumption of hashish.

==History==
The club was active from about 1844 to 1849 and counted the literary and intellectual elite of Paris among its members, including Dr. Jacques-Joseph Moreau, Théophile Gautier, Charles Baudelaire, Gérard de Nerval, Eugène Delacroix and Alexandre Dumas. Monthly &quot;séances&quot; were held at the Hôtel de Lauzun (at that time Hôtel Pimodan) on the Île Saint-Louis.

Gautier wrote about the club in &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot; in February 1846, where he described his first visit:

&quot;One December evening, obeying a mysterious summons, drafted in enigmatic terms understood by affiliates but unintelligible for others, I arrived in a distant quarter, a sort of oasis of solitude in the middle of Paris that the river, surrounding it with its two arms, seems to defend against the encroachments of civilization. It was in an old house on the island of Saint-Louis, the Hotel Pimodan, built by Lauzun, that the bizarre club of which I was a member recently held its monthly sittings where I was to attend for the first time.&quot;

While he is often cited as the founder of the club, in the article Gautier says he was attending their séances for the first time that evening and made clear that others were sharing a familiar experience with him. The club members often consumed &quot;Dawamesc&quot;, a greenish paste made from cannabis resin mixed with fat, honey, and pistachios.

During this period Jacques-Joseph Moreau, who specialized in the sociological concept of social alienation, studied the effects of regularly consuming hashish. Moreau studied this product according to his travels between 1837 and 1840 in Egypt and Syria, and Asia Minor. Back in France, he continued to experiment on himself and published an 1845 book entitled &quot;Hashish and mental alienation&quot; in which he establishes an equivalence between dream, hallucination, and hashish delirium. This book was the first written by a scientist about a drug.

Gautier and Baudelaire eventually stopped attending the sessions. Gautier writes: &quot;After a dozen experiments, we gave up forever this intoxicating drug, not that it hurt us physically, but the true writer needs only his natural dreams, and he does not like his thought to be influenced by any agent.&quot;

<text>Calvary Cemetery is a Roman Catholic cemetery that the Archdiocese of Los Angeles runs in the community of East Los Angeles, California. It is also called &quot;New Calvary Cemetery&quot; because it succeeded the original Calvary Cemetery (on north Broadway), over which Cathedral High School was built.

==History==

===Old Calvary===

When Los Angeles was originally surveyed and mapped under the leadership of Gen. Edward Ord in 1849, its graveyard was at the upper end of Eternity Street. At the lower end of Eternity was the first church in Los Angeles, the Placita. In between lay a part of town flanked by adobe houses, citrus trees, and Coast Live Oaks suitable for traditional funeral processions escorting believers to eternity. The land allotted to the cemetery lay between a creek a half block north of College Street and the toma (intake of the Zanja Madre) beyond the northern edge of town. That cemetery was named &quot;Calvary.&quot;

All the important magnates of the country around Los Angeles were buried at Calvary, such as Gen. Andrés Pico, the hero of the Battle of San Pascual, and Don Abel Stearns, a man of many ranchos. The ravine sloping down from the west took its name; it was called &quot;Cemetery Ravine&quot; (now &quot;Chavez Ravine,&quot; home of Dodger Stadium). Later, a Protestant cemetery for Los Angeles was laid out atop Fort Hill, where Grand Arts High School and the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels are now.

As Los Angeles swelled with settlers, so also did old Calvary Cemetery grow in size and importance, and a chapel was built. Large in scale for the desert Southwest of Southern California, that chapel was dedicated to the memory of a patron, Andrew Briswalter, who died in 1885. When conditions led to the founding of a new, even bigger cemetery on the other side of the Los Angeles River in 1896—in East Los Angeles—the property of the historic cemetery was put to other uses. At the time, many Italians began moving into the north side of Los Angeles, where they founded a new church on north Spring Street. So many Italians moved in, that the upper part of town became known as &quot;Little Italy.&quot; As it grew, a new, more permanent church building was sought, so parishioners bought the chapel of old Calvary Cemetery. The first child was baptized there in September 1904. The chapel was formally established as a church when Fr. A. Bucci dedicated the chapel of the old cemetery as St. Peter&#x27;s Church on July 4, 1915.

Old Calvary&#x27;s historic chapel survives today in the parish and buildings of St. Peter&#x27;s Italian Catholic Church, 1039 N Broadway. Historic old Calvary Cemetery was built over and much of it is now occupied by Cathedral High School.

===Current plots===

The current site across the river and uphill, measuring 137 acres, was dedicated in 1896. All Souls Chapel was built on the grounds in 1902, and was dedicated on All Souls&#x27; Day of that same year. Bishop George Thomas Montgomery offered a Solemn Pontifical Mass on a temporary altar at the site, and afterwards presided at the setting in place of the cornerstone. It was designed as a replica of the parish church of St. Giles in the rural town of Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, in England. That church is believed to have been the setting of the famed 18th-century poem &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot;. The chapel became one of the most visited places of worship in Southern California after its opening. All Souls Chapel is now used primarily for burial services.

The Main Mausoleum, with a new chapel, was built in 1936. It was designed by architect Ross Montgomery. Two additional mausoleums, Our Lady&#x27;s Garden and Gethsemane, have since been built. The cemetery has its own chaplain and daily Mass is offered in the chapel of the Main Mausoleum.

<text>Hollywood Forever Cemetery is a full-service cemetery, funeral home, crematory, and cultural events center which regularly hosts community events such as live music and summer movie screenings. It is one of the oldest cemeteries in Los Angeles, California and is located at 6000 Santa Monica Boulevard in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Hollywood. It was founded in 1899 as Hollywood Cemetery, and starting in 1939 was known as Hollywood Memorial Park, until 1998, when it was given its current name. The studios of Paramount Pictures are located at the south end of the same block, on that were once an undeveloped part of the cemetery.

Individuals interred in the cemetery include many prominent people from the entertainment industry, as well as people who played vital roles in shaping Los Angeles.

==History==

The only cemetery actually in Hollywood,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT1998/11/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood Forever was founded in 1899 on and named &quot;Hollywood Cemetery&quot; by F. W. Samuelson and (first name unknown) Lombard. In 1897, the two men were the owners of a tract of land near Hollywood in Los Angeles County. In that year, they—along with Mrs. M. W. Gardner of Santa Monica, Joseph D. Rodford, Gilbert Smith, and Thomas R. Wallace—formed a corporation known as the &quot;Hollywood Cemetery Association. The cemetery sold large tracts to Paramount Pictures, which, with RKO Pictures, bought by 1920. Part of the remaining land was set aside for the Beth Olam Cemetery, within the grounds of Hollywood Forever, a dedicated Jewish burial ground for members of the local Jewish community.

Jules Roth (1900–1998) was a convicted felon and millionaire. In 1939, he bought a 51% stake in the cemetery, which is the interment site of his parents. He used the money from the cemetery&#x27;s operations to pay for his personal luxuries. At that time, the cemetery was known as Hollywood Memorial Park. In the 1980s, the cemetery began to show signs of neglect and disrepair.

Actress Hattie McDaniel, best known for her role as Mammy in the epic movie &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (for which she became the first African American to win an Academy Award) had expressed a desire to be interred at Hollywood Memorial Park. At the time of McDaniel&#x27;s death in 1952, Hollywood Memorial, like other cemeteries, was segregated. Despite McDaniel&#x27;s expressed wish, Roth would not allow the actress to be interred in the cemetery. Hollywood Forever would be desegregated seven years later. In 1999 (the 47th anniversary of McDaniel&#x27;s death), the cemetery&#x27;s current owner dedicated a cenotaph in her honor at a prime location south of Sylvan Lake.

In July, 1974, the crematory was shut down following the cremation of singer Cass Elliot. According to cemetery grounds supervisor Daniel Ugarte, the crematory was in such disrepair that bricks began falling in around Elliot&#x27;s remains. The crematory remained closed for twenty-eight years until it was repaired and re-opened in 2002. The first incineration to be conducted at the cemetery since the incident, before the official reopening, was of George Harrison on November 29, 2001.

By the 1980s, the California Cemetery Board began receiving regular complaints from the families of people interred there. Family members complained that the grounds were not kept up and were disturbed to hear stories about vandalism on the cemetery grounds. The heirs of well-known makeup artist Max Factor (who was interred in the Beth Olam Mausoleum in 1938) moved his and other family members remains to Hillside Memorial Park in Culver City after the mausoleum sustained water damage that discolored the walls.

In 1986, a Los Angeles woman and 1,000 other plot owners filed a class action lawsuit against the cemetery for invasion of privacy after they discovered that Roth allowed employees of Paramount Pictures to park in the cemetery while the studio&#x27;s parking structure was undergoing construction.

In the late 1980s, Jules Roth sold two lawns totaling that were facing the Santa Monica Boulevard front of the property. It was reported that the property was paid for with cash. Those lawns are now strip malls that house, among other businesses, an auto parts store and a laundromat.

After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Roth could not afford to repair the roofs and other damage the earthquake caused to crypts. By that time, Hollywood Memorial was no longer making money and only generated revenue by charging families $500 for disinterments.

In 1997, Roth became ill after he fell in his Hollywood Hills home. He had been embroiled in a scandal regarding another cemetery he owned, Lincoln Memorial Park, in Carson, California in which hundreds of families came forward with a class-action suit over poor record keeping and missing bodies. Several months before his death, Roth was bedridden and disoriented, and during this time, his will was changed to provide for his business associates and maid, who were the only witnesses to his signature. His relatives, who were listed in his previous will, were written out. Roth died on January 4, 1998, and he was interred next to his wife, Virginia, his father, and his mother in the Cathedral Mausoleum. The state of California had revoked the cemetery&#x27;s license to sell its remaining interment spaces.

After Roth&#x27;s death, the cemetery&#x27;s subsequent owners Brent and Tyler Cassity, aka Tyo, LLC, discovered that the endowment care fund—meant to care for the cemetery in perpetuity—was missing about $9 million. Tyler Cassity also claimed that he discovered Mr. Roth&#x27;s bust in an antique shop, and that the bust was part of Mr. Roth&#x27;s personal artifacts that were sold at auction.

Those owners, Tyo, LLC, purchased the now property that was on the verge of closure in a bankruptcy proceeding, in 1998 for $375,000. They renamed the cemetery &quot;Hollywood Forever&quot; and set out to give it a complete restoration, investing millions in revitalizing the grounds and also offering documentaries about the deceased that are to be played in perpetuity on kiosks and are posted on the Web, as well as organizing tours to draw visitors.

Since 2002, the cemetery has screened films on weekends during the summer and on holidays at a gathering called Cinespia. The screenings are held on the Douglas Fairbanks Lawn near the Fairbanks crypt and the films are projected onto the white marble west wall of the Cathedral Mausoleum. Music events take place in the cemetery as well. On June 14 and 15, 2011, The Flaming Lips played at the cemetery in a two-night gig billed &quot;Everyone You Know Someday Will Die&quot;, a lyric from their 2002 single &quot;Do You Realize??&quot;.

The cemetery contained a Confederate Monument, erected in 1925 and maintained by the Long Beach chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy until August 15, 2017.

On August 17, 2013, electronic/industrial musician Gary Numan recorded a live album at the cemetery during his Splinter World Tour. It was released on February 19, 2016.

Also in 2013, Brent Cassity and his father, James Douglas Cassity, admitted guilt in a $600 million Ponzi scheme involving their control of National Prearranged Services, Inc. Brent Cassity was sentenced to 5 years in federal prison; James &quot;Doug&quot; Cassity was likewise sentenced to 9 years and 7 months. James Douglas Cassity died of natural causes in 2020, following his release by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

Plans for the Gower Court Mausoleum, a 100-foot-tall mausoleum, began in 2014. A &quot;highrise for the dead,&quot; two of the mausoleum&#x27;s five floors sold out prior to its January 2025 opening. 

==Cultural references==
A documentary about the cemetery called &quot;The Young and the Dead&quot;, was made in 2000.

The cemetery is briefly shown in the short &quot;Stopover in Hollywood&quot;. The television series &quot;90210&quot; featured the cemetery in the episode &quot;Hollywood Forever&quot;.

&quot;Talking Dead&quot; hosted a live 90-minute season premiere on the grounds, immediately following the Season 7 premiere of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. The grounds were also used to air the series finale of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.

The cemetery was a featured location in the 2015 Michael Connelly book &quot;The Crossing&quot;.

The title and opening line of FINNEAS&#x27; 2018 song &quot;Hollywood Forever&quot; mentions the cemetery.

David Robert Mitchell&#x27;s 2018 film &quot;Under the Silver Lake&quot; depicts a secret music show at the cemetery.

==Notable burials==
==&quot;Forever Tributes&quot;==
The cemetery&#x27;s website contains &quot;Forever Tributes&quot; of some interments, which consist of a video with introduction titles saying, &quot;A Hollywood Forever Tribute, in honor of...(name)&quot;. The body of the video contains photos and film clips of the honoree, interviews with friends or relatives, and music and narration. The conclusion shows the honoree&#x27;s name, birth year, and death year. For example, the cemetery&#x27;s &quot;Life Stories Archive&quot; has a tribute of Rudolph Valentino.

<text>Gérard de Nerval (; 22 May 1808 – 26 January 1855), the pen name of the French writer, poet, and translator Gérard Labrunie, was a French essayist, poet, translator, and travel writer. He was a major figure during the era of French romanticism, and best known for his novellas and poems, especially the collection &quot;Les Filles du feu&quot; (&quot;The Daughters of Fire&quot;), which included the novella &quot;Sylvie&quot; and the poem &quot;El Desdichado&quot;. Through his translations, Nerval played a major role in introducing French readers to the works of German Romantic authors, including Klopstock, Schiller, Bürger and Goethe. His later work merged poetry and journalism in a fictional context and influenced Marcel Proust. His last novella, &quot;Aurélia ou le rêve et la vie&quot;, influenced André Breton and Surrealism.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gérard Labrunie was born in Paris on 22 May 1808. His mother, Marie Marguerite Antoinette Laurent, was the daughter of a clothing salesman, and his father, Étienne Labrunie, was a young doctor who had volunteered to serve as a medic in the army under Napoleon.

In June 1808, soon after Gérard&#x27;s birth, Étienne was drafted. With his young wife in tow, Étienne followed the army on tours of Germany and Austria, eventually settling in a hospital in Głogów. While they travelled East, the Labrunies left their newborn son Gérard in the care of Marie Marguerite&#x27;s uncle Antoine Boucher, who lived in Mortefontaine, a small town in the Valois region, not far from Paris. On 29 November 1810 Marie Marguerite died before she could return to France. Gérard was two years old. Having buried his wife, Étienne took part in the disastrous French invasion of Russia. He was reunited with his son in 1814.

Upon his return to France in 1814, Étienne took his son and moved back to Paris, starting a medical practice at 72 rue Saint-Martin. Gérard lived with his father but often stayed with his great-uncle Boucher in Mortefontaine and with Gérard Dublanc at 2 rue de Mantes (now 2 rue du Maréchal Joffre) in Saint-Germain-en-Laye. (Dublanc, Étienne&#x27;s uncle, was also Gérard&#x27;s godfather.)

In 1822 Gérard enrolled at the collège Charlemagne. This was where he met and befriended Théophile Gautier. This was also where he began to take poetry more seriously. He was especially drawn to epic poetry. At age 16, he wrote a poem that recounted the circumstances of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat called &quot;&quot;. Later, he tried out satire, writing poems that took aim at Prime Minister Villèle, the Jesuit order, and anti-liberal newspapers like &quot;La Quotidienne&quot;. His writing started to be published in 1826.

At age 19, with minimal knowledge of the German language, he began the ambitious task of translating Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. His prose translation appeared in 1828. Despite its many flaws, the translation had many merits, and it did a great deal to establish his poetic reputation. It is the reason why Victor Hugo, the leader of the Romantic movement in France, felt compelled to have Gérard come to his apartment on 11, rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs.

===Cénacle===
In 1829, having received his baccalaureate degree two years late (perhaps because he skipped classes to go for walks and read for pleasure), Gérard was under pressure from his father to find steady employment. He took a job at a notary&#x27;s office, but his heart was set on literature. When Victor Hugo asked him to support his play &quot;Hernani&quot;, under attack from conservative critics suspicious of Romanticism, Gérard was more than happy to join the fight (see ).

Gérard was sympathetic to the liberal and republican atmosphere of the time, and was briefly imprisoned in 1832 for participating in student demonstrations. Gérard set himself two anthology projects: one on German poetry, and one on French poetry. Alexandre Dumas and Pierre-Sébastien Laurentie arranged a library card for him so he could carry out his research.

The first anthology included translations of Klopstock, Schiller, Bürger and Goethe, and met with less enthusiasm than his translation of &quot;Faust&quot;. The second anthology included poems by Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay, Jean-Antoine de Baïf, Guillaume Du Bartas and .

By the fall of 1830, the &quot;Cénacle&quot;, a group created by Sainte-Beuve to ensure Victor Hugo&#x27;s success with &quot;Hernani&quot;, had assembled many famed writers, including Alfred de Vigny, Alfred de Musset, Charles Nodier, Alexandre Dumas and Honoré de Balzac. After &quot;Hernani&quot;″s success, the Cénacle began to fall apart. At that time a new group appeared: the Petit-Cénacle, created by the sculptor Jean Bernard Duseigneur. Gérard attended some of the meetings, which took place in Duseigneur&#x27;s studio.

Gérard, following Hugo&#x27;s lead, started to write plays. &quot;Le Prince des sots&quot; and &quot;Lara ou l&#x27;expiation&quot; were shown at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Odéon and met with positive reviews. He started to use the pseudonym Gérard de Nerval, inspired by the name of a property near Loisy (a village near Ver-sur-Launette, Oise) which had belonged to his family.

===Work with Dumas===

In January 1834, Nerval&#x27;s maternal grandfather died and he inherited around 30,000 francs. That autumn, he headed to southern France and then travelled to Florence, Rome and Naples. On his return in 1835, he moved in with a group of Romantic artists (including ). In May of that year, he created &quot;Le Monde Dramatique,&quot; a luxurious literary journal on which he squandered his inheritance. Debt-ridden, he finally sold it in 1836. Getting his start in journalism, he travelled to Belgium with Gautier from July to September.

In 1837, &quot;Piquillo&quot; was shown at the Opéra-Comique. Despite Nerval&#x27;s work on the project, Dumas&#x27; was the only name on the libretto. played the main role. Nerval may have fallen in love with the actress. Some specialists claim that his unrequited love for her is what inspired many of the female figures that appear in his writing, including the Virgin Mary, Isis, the queen of Saba. Other experts disagree with this biographical analysis.

Despite Dumas&#x27; refusal to let him take credit for his work, Nerval continued to collaborate with Dumas on plays. In the summer of 1838, he travelled with Dumas to Germany to work on &quot;Léo Burckart,&quot; which eventually premiered at the Théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin on 16 April 1839, six days after the premiere of another play the pair worked on together called &quot;L&#x27;Alchimiste.&quot; In November 1839, Nerval travelled to Vienna, where he met the pianist Marie Pleyel at the French embassy.

===First nervous breakdowns===

Back in France in March 1840, Nerval took over Gautier&#x27;s column at &quot;La Presse.&quot; After publishing a third edition of &quot;Faust&quot; in July, including a preface and fragments of &quot;Second Faust,&quot; he travelled to Belgium in October. On 15 December &quot;Piquillo&quot; premiered in Brussels, where Nerval crossed paths with Jenny Colon and Marie Pleyel once again.

After a first nervous breakdown on 23 February 1841, he was cared for at the Sainte-Colombe Borstal (&quot;maison de correction&quot;). On 1 March Jules Janin published an obituary for Nerval in the &quot;Journal des Débats.&quot; After a second nervous breakdown, Nerval was housed in Docteur Esprit Blanche&#x27;s clinic in Montmartre, where he remained from March to November.

===Travels===

On 22 December 1842, Nerval set off for the Near East, travelling to Alexandria, Cairo, Beirut, Constantinople, Malta and Naples. Back in Paris in 1843, he began to publish articles about his trip in 1844. His &quot;Voyage en Orient&quot; appeared in 1851.

Between 1844 and 1847, Nerval travelled to Belgium, the Netherlands, and London, producing travel writing. At the same time, he wrote novellas and opera librettos and translated poems by his friend Heinrich Heine, publishing a selection of translations in 1848. His last years were spent in dire financial and emotional straits. Following his doctor Emile Blanche&#x27;s advice, he tried to purge himself of his intense emotions in his writing. This is when he composed some of his best works.
Nerval had a pet lobster named Thibault, which he walked at the end of a blue silk ribbon in the Palais-Royal in Paris. According to Théophile Gautier, Nerval said:
In his later years, Nerval also took an interest in socialism, tracing its origins to the eighteenth-century Illuminists and esoteric authors such as Nicolas-Edme Rétif.

===Suicide===

Increasingly poverty-stricken and disoriented, he took his own life during the night of 26 January 1855, by hanging himself from the bar of a cellar window in the rue de la Vieille-Lanterne, a narrow lane in a squalid section of Paris. He left a brief note to his aunt: &quot;Don&#x27;t wait up for me this evening, for the night will be black and white.&quot; Just like in English, in French a &quot;nuit blanche&quot; (literal translation: a white night) is a sleepless night. 

The poet Charles Baudelaire observed that Nerval had &quot;delivered his soul in the darkest street that he could find.&quot; The discoverers of his body were puzzled by the fact that his hat was still on his head. The last pages of his manuscript for &quot;&quot; were found in a pocket of his coat. After a religious ceremony at the Notre-Dame cathedral (which was granted despite his suicide because of his troubled mental state), he was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, at the expense of his friends Théophile Gautier and Arsène Houssaye, who published &quot;Aurélia&quot; as a book later that year.

The complete works of Gérard de Nerval are published in three volumes by Gallimard in the collection &quot;Bibliothèque de la Pléiade&quot;.

==Assessments and legacy==
Goethe read Nerval&#x27;s translation of &quot;Faust&quot; and called it &quot;very successful&quot;, even claiming that he preferred it to the original.

The composer Hector Berlioz relied on Nerval&#x27;s translation of Faust for his work &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot;, which premiered in 1846.

In 1867, Nerval&#x27;s friend Théophile Gautier (1811–1872) wrote a touching reminiscence of him in &quot;La Vie de Gérard&quot; which was included in his &quot;Portraits et Souvenirs Littéraires&quot; (1875).

For Marcel Proust, Nerval was one of the greatest writers of the nineteenth century. Proust especially admired Sylvie&#x27;s exploration of time lost and regained, which would become one of Proust&#x27;s deepest interests and the dominant theme of his magnum opus &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. Later, André Breton named Nerval a precursor of Surrealist art, which drew on Nerval&#x27;s forays into the significance of dreams. For his part, Antonin Artaud compared Nerval&#x27;s visionary poetry to the work of Hölderlin, Nietzsche and Van Gogh.

In 1945, at the end of the Second World War and after a long illness, the Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung delivered a lecture in Zürich on Nerval&#x27;s &quot;Aurélia&quot; which he regarded as a work of &quot;extraordinary magnitude&quot;. Jung described Nerval&#x27;s memoir as a cautionary tale (the protagonist cannot profit psychologically from his own lucidity and profound insights), and he validates Nerval&#x27;s visionary experience as a genuine encounter with the collective unconscious and &quot;anima mundi&quot;.

Umberto Eco in his &quot;Six Walks in the Fictional Woods&quot; calls Nerval&#x27;s &quot;Sylvie&quot; a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and analysed it to demonstrate the use of temporal ambiguity.

Henry Miller called Nerval an &quot;extraordinary French poet&quot; and included him among a group of exemplary translators:&quot;[i]n English we have yet to produce a poet who is able to do for Rimbaud what Baudelaire did for Poe&#x27;s verse, or Nerval for &quot;Faust&quot;, or Morel and Larbaud for &quot;Ulysses&quot;&quot;. Literary critic Harold Bloom called him &quot;a pure instance of Faustian man&quot; but judged that &quot;the sorrow of his unmothered and unloved existence destroyed him before&quot; his genius could &quot;fus[e] all the visionary&#x27;s contraries together.&quot;

Twentieth century French composer Denise Roger used Nerval&#x27;s texts for some of her songs.

The English rock band Traffic included the jazz-rock track &quot;Dream Gerrard&quot; in their 1974 album &quot;When the Eagle Flies&quot;. Lyrics are known to be mainly written by Vivian Stanshall after reading Nerval&#x27;s biography.

There are streets named after Nerval in the towns of Saint-Denis, Béthisy-Saint-Pierre, Crépy-en-Valois, Creil, Mortefontaine, Othis and Senlis.

<text>USS &quot;Pampanito&quot; (SS-383/AGSS-383), a , is a United States Navy ship, the third named for the pompano fish. She completed six war patrols from 1944 to 1945 and served as a United States Naval Reserve training ship from 1960 to 1971. She is now a National Historic Landmark, preserved as a memorial and museum ship in the San Francisco Maritime National Park Association located at Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf in San Francisco, California.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Pampanito&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, on 15 March 1943. She was launched on 12 July 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Violet Wolfenden, and commissioned on 6 November 1943.

== World War II ==
After shakedown off New London, Connecticut, &quot;Pampanito&quot; transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 14 February 1944.

=== First patrol, March - May 1944 ===

&quot;Pampanito&quot;″s first war patrol, from 15 March to 2 May, was conducted in the southwest approaches to Saipan and Guam. She served on lifeguard duty south of Yap, then scored two torpedo hits on a destroyer before sailing for Midway Island and Pearl Harbor for refit and repairs to a hull badly damaged by depth charges.

=== Second patrol, June - July 1944 ===

&quot;Pampanito&quot;″s second war patrol, from 3 June to 23 July, took place off Kyūshū, Shikoku, and Honshū. On 23 June, a submerged Japanese submarine fired two torpedoes, just missing &quot;Pampanito&quot;. On 6 July, &quot;Pampanito&quot; damaged a Japanese gunboat, and 11 days later headed for Midway Island.

=== Third patrol, August - September 1944 ===

&quot;Pampanito&quot;″s third war patrol, from 17 August to 28 September, a wolfpack operation with submarines and , was conducted in the South China Sea. On 12 September, she sank the 9,419-ton , which unfortunately was transporting 1,350 British and Australian prisoners of war (POWs), also the 5,135-ton tanker &quot;Zuihō Maru&quot;, and she damaged a third ship. The Japanese survivors were rescued by an escort vessel, leaving POWs in the water with rafts and some abandoned boats. A total of 1,159 POWs died, of whom some 350 in lifeboats were bombarded and killed by a Japanese naval vessel the next day when they were rowing towards land. On 15 September, &quot;Pampanito&quot; moved back to the area of the original attack and found men clinging to makeshift rafts. As the sub moved closer, the men were heard to be shouting in English. &quot;Pampanito&quot; was able to pick up 73 British and Australian survivors and called in three other subs, &quot;Sealion&quot;, and , to assist with the rescue. She then set course for Saipan, disembarked the survivors, and continued on to Pearl Harbor.

=== Fourth patrol, October - December 1944 ===

&quot;Pampanito&quot;″s fourth war patrol, from 28 October to 30 December, took place off Formosa and the coast of southeastern China with , , and . Sinking the 1,200-ton cargo ship &quot;Shinko Maru Number One&quot;, 19 November, she damaged a second ship before putting into Fremantle for refit.

=== Fifth patrol, January - February 1945 ===
&quot;Pampanito&quot;″s fifth war patrol in the Gulf of Siam, from 23 January to 12 February 1945, with , was highlighted by two sinkings, the 6,968-ton cargo ship &quot;Engen Maru&quot; 6 February and the 3,520-ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Eifuku Maru&quot; on 8 February.

=== Sixth patrol ===

Refitted at Subic Bay, &quot;Pampanito&quot; returned to the Gulf of Siam for her sixth war patrol. Operating with , &quot;Sealion&quot;, and , she sighted only one target before sailing for Pearl Harbor.

== 1945–1971 ==

From Pearl Harbor the ship proceeded to San Francisco for overhaul, departing for Pearl Harbor again 1 August. With the end of the war, she was ordered to return to San Francisco. She was decommissioned at Mare Island on 15 December 1945. She remained in reserve until April 1960 when she was assigned to Naval Reserve Training at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Reclassified AGSS-383, 6 November 1962, she served as a Naval Reserve Training ship at Vallejo, California, until she was stricken from the Navy Register on 20 December 1971.

&quot;Pampanito&quot; earned six battle stars for World War II service.

== Museum ship ==
&quot;Pampanito&quot; was turned into a memorial and museum at San Francisco on 21 November 1975, transferred to the Maritime Park Association (formerly the National Maritime Museum Association) on 20 May 1976, and opened to the public on 15 March 1982.
In 1986, &quot;Pampanito&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and declared to be a National Historic Landmark.

She is now owned and operated by the San Francisco Maritime National Park Association and is moored at Pier 45 in San Francisco&#x27;s Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf area, where she is open for visiting.

The USS PAMPANITO Amateur Radio Club brings the radio room to life on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays of each month using the callsign NJ6VTNJVT was the boat&#x27;s call sign during WWII. Ham radio operators may contact the boat on 7.260 and 14.260 MHz using voice, and on other frequencies using Morse Code.

She flies a broom from her mast, indicating a clean sweep: a successful patrol that &quot;swept the enemy from the seas. In total, she sank six Japanese ships and damaged four others with a total of more than 27,000 tons of enemy shipping sunk.

&quot;Pampanito&quot; has completed four maintenance dry dockings since becoming a memorial and museum. &quot;The Pampanito still has several working parts, including one torpedo tube, the periscope, engines, galley and ice-cream maker.&quot; The museum runs educational programs including one that allows organized groups of children and adults to sleep overnight in the submarine&#x27;s 48 bunk beds.

The ship was closed to the public and moved to a dry-dock on 23 September 2016 and returned from Bay Ship &amp; Yacht in Alameda, CA on 14 November 2016 and is currently open to the public.

&quot;Pampanito&quot; and the Liberty ship were threatened by a four-alarm fire on 23 May 2020, but were saved by local firefighters.
== In film ==

&quot;Pampanito&quot; played the fictional USS &quot;Stingray&quot; (SS-161) in the 1996 comedy film &quot;Down Periscope&quot;. Kelsey Grammer stars as the &quot;Stingray&quot;″s commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Thomas Dodge, and the film is set on the United States East Coast in the harbors at Charleston, South Carolina, and Norfolk, Virginia. The action scenes use a combination of a special effects shooting miniature for the composited underwater scenes, older &quot;Pampanito&quot; color stock footage of her under power on the surface, then submerging, and newly shot footage of &quot;Pampanito&quot; moving under tow in San Francisco Bay while venturing past the Golden Gate Bridge. It had been fifty years since she last passed under the bridge.

<text>Pavel Andreievich Chekov () is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

Walter Koenig portrayed Chekov in the second and third seasons of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and the first seven Star Trek films. Anton Yelchin portrayed the character in the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot film and two sequels, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; and &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;. Both Koenig and Yelchin were born to Russian parents, but grew up in the United States, and both affected Russian accents for their roles.

==Origin==
&quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry wanted to include a younger cast member to appeal to teenage audiences. With a second season of &quot;Star Trek&quot; to be produced, Roddenberry interviewed Walter Koenig on the recommendation of director Joseph Pevney. After casting Koenig, Roddenberry wrote a letter to Mikhail Zimyanin, editor of &quot;Pravda&quot;, informing him of the introduction of a Russian character, and an NBC press release announcing the character at the time stated that it was in response to a &quot;Pravda&quot; article, condemning the show for having no Russian characters. The existence of such a Pravda article is disputed. Roddenberry also acknowledged that the character was in response to the popularity of The Monkees&#x27; Davy Jones. Koenig always denied the &quot;Russian origin&quot; story and affirmed that his character was added in response to the popularity of The Monkees, and the character&#x27;s hairstyle and appearance are a direct reference to this. Roddenberry had previously mentioned, in a memo to his casting director, a desire to have someone reminiscent of one of The Beatles or Monkees on the show.

Koenig&#x27;s modest height, eyes, thick eyebrows, boyish face, and smile were all strikingly evocative of the lone British &quot;Monkee&quot; who captivated millions of pre-teen girls. Early attempts were made to style Koenig&#x27;s brown hair similar to that of Jones too. Wigs were used in a couple of early episodes but not in others, which reveals a stage of experimentation to attentive viewers. Eventually, a final look for Koenig&#x27;s hair length and fullness was reached and used consistently thereafter.

After Paramount Television signed Koenig to a contract because of the number of fan letters he received as Chekov, Roddenberry wrote in another memo &quot;Kirk and Spock and the others actually seem rather &#x27;middle aged&#x27; to the large youthful segment of our audience. We badly need a young man aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;we need youthful attitudes and perspectives. Chekov can be used potently here&quot;. In actuality, Koenig is only five years younger than co-stars Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner.

The episode &quot;Amok Time&quot;, the first episode shot with the Chekov character, would be broadcast a month later to roughly coincide with Halloween). Because of budgetary constraints, the character did not appear in the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

==Character biography==
Pavel Andreievich Chekov was born in 2245 and is a young and naïve ensign who first appears on-screen in the original series’ second season as the &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s navigator. According to Roddenberry, he is &quot;an extraordinarily capable young man—almost Spock&#x27;s equal in some areas. An honor graduate of the Space Academy.&quot; Chekov also substitutes for Mr. Spock at the science officer station when necessary. His promotion to lieutenant for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; brings with it his transfer as the ship&#x27;s tactical officer and chief of security. During his tour of Duty on the Enterprise, Chekov lost his mind on three occasions: in &quot;Day of the Dove&quot; Chekov was implanted with false memories and driven to violence by a non-corporeal alien entity; in &quot;And the Children Shall Lead&quot;, Chekov was exposed to mind control by a group of children who had been given powers by a non-corporeal being; and in &quot;The Tholian Web&quot; Chekov became violently insane following exposure to interspace. Furthermore, in the film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, Chekov was subject to mind control after being implanted with a juvenile Ceti eel. A running gag on Star Trek is that whenever Chekov gets into personal combat with opponents stronger than him, he loses the fight: &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; with Klingons or &quot;The Gamesters of Triskelion&quot; with the gladiator-like slaves/thralls. In &quot;Spectre of the Gun&quot; he is shot and killed in the fantasy but survives only because he was thinking of a beautiful fantasy woman. He also likes the beautiful female androids in &quot;I, Mudd&quot;.

By the events of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, Chekov is executive officer aboard the USS &quot;Reliant&quot;. In that film, Khan Noonien Singh uses a creature that wraps itself around Chekov&#x27;s cerebral cortex to control him and his captain. Chekov overcomes the creature&#x27;s mind control and serves as &quot;Enterprise&quot; tactical officer in the film&#x27;s climactic battle.

A common myth about &quot;Star Trek&quot; is that Khan recognizing Chekov in the film is a continuity error because &quot;Space Seed&quot;, with the villain, was broadcast before Koenig&#x27;s casting. &quot;Adaptations: From Text to Screen, Screen to Text&quot; calls this &quot;the apparent gaffe notorious throughout Star Trek fandom&quot;. Although Chekov does not appear in &quot;Space Seed&quot;, &quot;Catspaw&quot;—with the character—has an earlier stardate. Koenig joked that Khan remembers Chekov from the episode after he takes too long in a restroom Khan wants to use.

Chekov is an accomplice in Kirk&#x27;s theft of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to rescue Spock in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, but is exonerated in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;. He serves as navigator aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A during the events of &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. The character&#x27;s final film appearance is as a guest aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B on its maiden voyage in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;. Chekov is mentioned in the series finale of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; as being deceased in a broadcast by his son, Anton, who is serving as the president of the Federation. Koenig insisted that the character be called Anton as a tribute to the late Anton Yelchin, who inherited his role as Chekov for the J. J. Abrams reboot films.

Spinoff novels show a continued career path, but these are not considered canon in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. Novels written by William Shatner detail that Chekov reaches the rank of admiral, and even serves as Commander in Chief of Starfleet.

=== Reboot films ===

The 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film creates an alternate timeline in the franchise. In this timeline, Anton Yelchin&#x27;s portrayal presents Chekov as a 17-year-old prodigy whose mathematical ability proves instrumental in a few events within the film.
In the sequel, &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, Chekov finds himself promoted to chief engineer after Scotty resigns. When Kirk orders him to put on a red shirt, a brief sting is heard as a closeup shows Chekov&#x27;s nervous face, playing on the reputation of redshirts in the franchise as much as the character&#x27;s shock regarding his sudden promotion.

The third film, &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, was Yelchin&#x27;s final appearance as Chekov, the film seeing Chekov accompanying Kirk after the entire crew is marooned on an uncharted planet following the destruction of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, forcing them to destroy the last of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to escape a trap and later work with the rest of the senior staff to restart a long-lost Starfleet ship to escape the planet and defeat a plan to attack the Federation.

====Anton Yelchin&#x27;s death====
Yelchin was crushed to death by his 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee on June 19, 2016, a little more than a month before the scheduled release of &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; on July 22, 2016. All filming had been completed and post-production had started. A dedication to Yelchin&#x27;s memory was inserted into the credits. J. J. Abrams, producer of the reboot trilogy and director of its first two films, has stated that the role will not be recast for future sequels, implying the character of Chekov will be written out in future films.

==Fan productions==
Walter Koenig reprised his role as Chekov 12 years after &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; in the fan-created series &quot;New Voyages&quot; episode &quot;To Serve All My Days&quot;. Andy Bray portrayed a younger Chekov in that episode. Koenig reprised the character again in &quot;Star Trek: Renegades&quot; as 143-year-old Admiral Chekov, the newly appointed head of Section 31. He has stated that should there be a sequel, he would reprise Chekov and then retire from the role. He also returned as Chekov in the online miniseries &quot;Star Trek: Of Gods and Men&quot;.

In scientific illustrator Jenny Parks&#x27; 2017 book &quot;Star Trek Cats&quot;, Chekov is depicted as a Russian Blue.

== Reception ==
In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; placed Chekov as 21st out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;. In 2016, Chekov was ranked as the 30th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, out of 100 characters.

In 2018, Comic Book Resources ranked Chekov the 22nd best member of Starfleet.

<doc id="180441" wikidata="Q16386787" url="?curid=180441" title="Love in a Cold Climate">
<text>Love in a Cold Climate is a novel by Nancy Mitford, first published in 1949. The title is a phrase from George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; (1936).

&quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; is a companion volume to &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot;. The time frame of &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot; is the same as &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot;, but the focus is on a different set of characters. Fanny remains the fictional narrator. In &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot;, Fanny narrates the story of her cousin Linda Radlett. In &quot;Love in a Cold Climate&quot;, Fanny narrates the story of Polly, to whom Fanny is distantly related through her father&#x27;s family.

==Synopsis==
Lady Leopoldina &quot;Polly&quot; Hampton is the only child of the supremely aristocratic and very rich Earl of Montdore and his wife, Sonia. Lady Montdore is a product of the minor ranks of the aristocracy and her marriage to an earl is regarded as a social coup on her part. She is depicted by Fanny as an avaricious, greedy snob, but not without charm. Her thrusting personality, allied to her husband&#x27;s impeccable social standing, riches and political influence makes her a formidable woman. Lady Montdore, unbeknownst to Lord Montdore, takes advantage of her husband&#x27;s reputation to forward her own career as a hostess and manipulator of her social circle. Their daughter is Polly, with whom Fanny loses contact when Lord Montdore is sent as Viceroy of India.

Fanny receives an invitation to visit the Montdores upon their return from India. She has great affection for Polly, but Polly reveals little of herself. Polly has &quot;come out&quot; in India and as a beautiful and socially important debutante is expected to have a very successful season in London. However, Polly consistently demonstrates a total lack of interest in the London season and all of the men she meets. She is hoping that &quot;in a cold climate&quot;, society will be less interested in love affairs. Lady Montdore is exasperated by her daughter&#x27;s apparent indifference to love and marriage. &quot;Important&quot; potential suitors acknowledge that Polly is very beautiful, but find her cold and aloof. Polly reveals to no one that she has been in love with her uncle, &quot;Boy&quot; Dougdale (the husband of her paternal aunt), since she was 14. Boy is snobbish and sexually rapacious; his many affairs are common knowledge to both his wife and society at large. Fanny and her Radlett cousins have long suspected that the sexually ambiguous Boy has paedophilic tendencies, and he is a joke amongst Fanny&#x27;s cousins for his inappropriate touches and &quot;lecherous&quot; behaviour towards young girls. Polly marries Boy shortly after her aunt&#x27;s death, causing a scandal in her social circle and distressing her parents deeply. Unbeknownst to Polly, Boy has been Lady Montdore&#x27;s lover for many years. She is excluded from her father&#x27;s will upon her marriage and she and Boy ostracised from society. They move to Sicily, where they remain for several years.

Polly&#x27;s place in the family is filled by the heir to Lord Montdore&#x27;s entailed fortune and title, Cedric Hampton. Born in Nova Scotia to a minor member of the Montdore family, Cedric has used his exceptional good looks and personal charm to establish a place within the homosexual milieu of the European aristocracy. He has lived a life of luxury as the lover of rich and aristocratic men. Cedric accepts an invitation to visit the Montdores. His natural love of beauty, innate good taste, and careful use of flattery enable Cedric to win the affections of Lord and Lady Montdore and many others. Cedric focuses his attentions upon Lady Montdore who uses Cedric&#x27;s popularity and charm to reestablish herself as a leading society hostess, to Cedric&#x27;s advantage.

Fanny and Cedric soon become close friends. Polly and Boy return from Sicily, out of love and their marriage turned sour. While pregnant, Polly is regularly visited by the Duke of Paddington (a fictional title), who lavishes her with attention. There comes a reconciliation between Polly and Lady Montdore, Polly having borne a child who lived for minutes. &quot;Cedric arranged the whole thing perfectly&quot;, according to Fanny. While Polly recovers from the difficult birth, Cedric, Boy and Lady Montdore go to France, leaving Polly free to be carried off by the duke. The trio return to Hampton and happily establish a ménage there. While this outcome shocks the conservative social circles in which they mix, Fanny takes a more broad-minded view, pleased to see people she loves each finding happiness in their own way.

==Characters==
*Leopoldina &quot;Polly&quot; Hampton, the daughter of Lord and Lady Montdore, is renowned for her beauty but not much else.

*Veronica Chaddesley-Corbett, the most popular and prominent socialite of her day and an important visitor at Hampton

<doc id="180444" wikidata="Q878739" url="?curid=180444" title="Bruce Babbitt">
<text>Bruce Edward Babbitt (born June 27, 1938) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 47th United States Secretary of the Interior from 1993 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. He previously served as the 16th governor of Arizona from 1978 to 1987 and was a candidate for President of the United States in the 1988 Democratic primaries.

He won election as Arizona attorney general after graduating from Harvard Law School. He became Governor of Arizona after the death of his predecessor, Wesley Bolin. Babbitt won election to a full term in 1978 and won re-election in 1982. He focused on tax reform, health care, and water management. He helped found the Democratic Leadership Council and sought the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, but dropped out of the race after the first set of primaries.

From 1988 to 1992, Babbitt served as head of the League of Conservation Voters. Clinton strongly considered nominating Babbitt to the Supreme Court after vacancies arose in 1993 and 1994. After leaving public office in 2001, Babbitt became an attorney with Latham &amp; Watkins.

==Personal life==
Babbitt was born into a prominent Roman Catholic Flagstaff, Arizona family, the son of Frances B. (Perry) and Paul James Babbitt Sr. His family owned a department store in Flagstaff, a ranch in northern Arizona, and multiple Indian trading posts. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame, attended Newcastle University in the United Kingdom on a Marshall Scholarship, and then received his J.D. degree at Harvard Law School.

He married Harriet Coons (known as Hattie) in 1968. She has worked as an attorney in Arizona and Washington, D.C., and served as United States Ambassador to the Organization of American States from 1993 to 1997, and as Deputy Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development from 1997 to 2001 during the Clinton Administration.

As attorney for the &quot;Scottsdale Daily Progress&quot; newspaper, Babbitt worked with publisher Jonathan Marshall in crafting legislation that became Arizona&#x27;s &quot;open meeting law.&quot;

==Political career==

===Arizona===

In the state election of November 1974, Babbitt overcame Republican incumbent N. Warner Lee to become Attorney General of Arizona.

He succeeded Wesley Bolin as governor when Bolin died in office on March 4, 1978. Arizona does not have a lieutenant governor; the Arizona Secretary of State, if holding office by election, stands first in line in case the governor vacates his or her post. However, Rose Mofford, then secretary of state, had been appointed to her post and thus was not eligible to become governor according to the Arizona state constitution. Babbitt, as attorney general, was next in the line of succession, and thus served the balance of the term to which Raúl Héctor Castro had originally been elected in 1974. Babbitt was elected for a full four-year term later in 1978, and again in 1982. He did not run for a third full term in 1986.

In 1982, Babbitt intervened in negotiations between the Cochise County sheriff and leaders of the Christ Miracle Healing Church and Center over the release of church members whom the church was hiding from facing charges for assault. The church, which had been implicated in bomb-making, would play a central role in the Miracle Valley shootout later that year. In 1983, Babbitt sent the Arizona National Guard to the strike against the Phelps Dodge mining company in Morenci, Arizona.

With the retirement of Republican Barry Goldwater from the U.S. Senate in 1986, many in Arizona expected Babbitt to oppose Representative John McCain for the seat. In a surprise press conference in 1985, Babbitt instead announced he would forgo the Senate race to concentrate on a White House bid in 1988.

===National work===
In 1979, Babbitt was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to serve as a commissioner on the President&#x27;s Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island, a six-month investigation of the March 1979 accident at a commercial nuclear power plant at Middletown, Pennsylvania. Babbitt spoke at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, which nominated incumbent Jimmy Carter as the Democratic candidate for president.

A founding member of the Democratic Leadership Council and the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association in 1985, Babbitt sought the Democratic Party&#x27;s 1988 nomination for President of the United States. Among his proposals was a national sales tax to remedy the then-record budget deficits piled up during the several past administrations. He enjoyed positive press attention (called a &quot;boomlet&quot; in &quot;USA Today&quot;), but after finishing out of the top tier of candidates in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, he dropped out of the race. In an intentional reference to Richard Nixon (who said after losing the California governorship in the 1962 election that the press &quot;won&#x27;t have [me] to kick around anymore&quot;), Babbitt joked in his last campaign press conference that the media &quot;won&#x27;t have Bruce Babbitt to puff up anymore.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Babbitt dropped this line from the prepared text of his withdrawal speech.

===Secretary of the Interior 1993–2001===
After leading the League of Conservation Voters, Babbitt served for eight years, 1993–2001, as the Secretary of the Interior during the Presidency of Bill Clinton. According to John D. Leshy:
:His most remembered legacies will likely be his advocacy of environmental restoration, his efforts to safeguard and build support for the ESA (the Endangered Species Act of 1973) and the biodiversity that it helps protect, and the public land conservation measures that flowered on his watch.

Babbitt worked to protect scenic and historic areas of America&#x27;s federal public lands. In 2000 Babbitt created the National Landscape Conservation System, a collection of 15 U.S. National Monuments and 14 National Conservation Areas to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management in such a way as to keep them &quot;healthy, open, and wild.&quot;

A major issue involved low fees charged ranchers who grazed cattle on public lands. The &quot;animal unit month&quot; (AUM) fee was only $1.35 and was far below the 1983 market value. The argument was that the federal government in effect was subsidizing ranchers, with a few major corporations controlling millions of acres of grazing land. Babbitt tried to rally environmentalists and raise fees, but senators from Western states successfully blocked his proposals.

In 1993, Babbitt was seriously considered by President Clinton to replace retiring United States Supreme Court Justice Byron White. Due to his lead on environmental issues, however, Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg instead. Clinton again considered Babbitt for the high court in 1994 when Harry Blackmun announced his retirement. Babbitt was passed over again, this time in favor of Stephen Breyer, due to Breyer&#x27;s immense support in the U.S. Senate, primarily because he was close to Sen. Ted Kennedy.

In 1998 Babbitt was the subject of a federal grand jury investigation into whether he had lied to Congress about having denied an Indian casino license in Wisconsin in return for political donations. The controversy has been called Wampumgate. Babbitt was cleared of wrongdoing in the special prosecutor&#x27;s final report on the investigation the following year.

==Post-political life==

Babbitt took a job as chief counsel of the environmental litigation department of Latham &amp; Watkins, an international law firm, after leaving the Department of the Interior. During his time at Latham &amp; Watkins, Babbitt offended many environmentalists by taking on two clients trying to build large developments near the coastline. Babbitt defended both projects, one on Hearst Corporation land in central California and the other on the Ahmanson Ranch north of Los Angeles.

Babbitt has attracted the ire of some environmentalists and Native American groups for his representation of the Arizona Snowbowl ski resort and its effort to expand the resort and use waste water to make artificial snow.

He serves as trustee of the World Wildlife Fund Secretariat Trustees in the U.S., and was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations until 2012. He has also served on the Board of Directors since 2009 for the Amazon Conservation Association, whose mission is to conserve the biological diversity of the Amazon. Babbitt is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

<doc id="180447" wikidata="Q565604" url="?curid=180447" title="Bert Bolin">
<text>Bert Rickard Johannes Bolin (; 15 May 1925 – 30 December 2007) was a Swedish meteorologist who served as the first chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), from 1988 to 1997. He was professor of meteorology at Stockholm University from 1961 until his retirement in 1990.

==Background==
Bolin was born in Nyköping, Sweden and graduated from Uppsala University in 1946. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in 1949 and a doctorate in 1956, both in meteorology, at Stockholm University. During his doctorate he spent a year in 1950 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he worked with Jule Charney, John von Neumann and others on the first computerized weather forecast, using ENIAC, the first electronic computer.

Bolin&#x27;s marriage to Ulla Frykstrand ended in divorce in 1979; they had three children: Dan, Karina and Göran. Bolin resided in Österskär, northeast of Stockholm where he also died aged 82. He remained active until shortly before his death.

==Career and awards==
Bolin was professor of meteorology at Stockholm University 1961–1990, and involved in international climate research cooperation from the 1960s. Bolin was involved in organising use of the new satellite tools for climate research, which led to the formation of the ICSU Committee on Atmospheric Sciences (CAS) in 1964, with Bolin becoming its first chairman. CAS started the Global Atmospheric Research Programme (GARP) in 1967, which Bolin also chaired; GARP became the World Climate Research Programme in 1980.

Bolin served on the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases from 1985. In 1987, the 500-page Brundtland Report which Bolin was involved with contributed to the setting up of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Under his chairmanship (from 1988 to 1997), the IPCC produced its First Assessment Report (1990) and Second Assessment Report (1995), contributing to the IPCC sharing the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former US vice president Al Gore. Bolin was asked to accept the Prize on behalf of the IPCC, but was too ill to attend. Bolin is credited with bringing together a diverse range of views among the panel&#x27;s 3,500 scientists into something resembling a consensus. The first report led to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the second to the Kyoto Protocol.

He has been scientific director of the European Space Research Organisation (now known as European Space Agency). He was co-founder of Stockholm Environment Institute in 1988 and chairman of its board in the 1990s as well as special advisor on climate and energy. 

He received many awards and honors for his work in climate research, including the International Meteorological Organization Prize (1981), Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal (1984), the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement (1988), the highest atmospheric science award of the American Meteorological Society, Körber European Science Prize (1990), the Milutin Milankovic Medal in 1993,
and the Blue Planet Prize (1995), often considered as the Nobel Prize for environmental sciences. He also jointly received the Global Environment Facility&#x27;s 1999 Global Environment Leadership Award. Bolin was a member of the Swedish, Norwegian (from 1975) and Russian Academies of Sciences.

In November 2007, shortly before his death, Bolin published the partly autobiographical &quot;A History of the Science and Politics of Climate Change: The Role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&quot;. The Bolin Centre for Climate Research at Stockholm University was named in his memory in 2008.

<doc id="180456" wikidata="Q271111" url="?curid=180456" title="Mary Stewart (novelist)">
<text>Mary, Lady Stewart (born Mary Florence Elinor Rainbow; 17 September 1916 – 9 May 2014) was a British novelist who developed the romantic mystery genre, featuring smart, adventurous heroines who could hold their own in dangerous situations. She also wrote children&#x27;s books and poetry, but may be best known for her Merlin series, which straddles the boundary between the historical novel and fantasy.

Adaptations of her books include both &quot;The Moon-Spinners&quot;: a Walt Disney live-action movie, and &quot;The Little Broomstick&quot; (1971) which became an animated feature film titled &quot;Mary and the Witch&#x27;s Flower&quot; (2017, dir. Hiromasa Yonebayashi). 

== Early life and education ==
Mary Florence Elinor Rainbow was born on 17 September 1916 in Sunderland, County Durham, England, UK, daughter of Mary Edith Matthews, a primary school teacher from New Zealand, and Frederick Albert Rainbow, a vicar. 

She was a bright child and attended Eden Hall boarding school in Penrith, Cumbria, age eight. She was bullied there and stated that this had a lasting effect on her. At ten, she won a scholarship to Skellfield School, Ripon, Yorkshire, where she excelled at sport. Offered places by Oxford, Cambridge, and Durham universities, she chose Durham as it offered the largest bursary and least travel. 

She graduated from Durham University in 1938 with first-class honours in English, was awarded a first-class Teaching Diploma in English with Art the following year and in 1941 gained her master&#x27;s degree. 

== Academic teaching ==
Stewart held a variety of posts during World War II, including primary school teaching, teaching at secondary level at a girls&#x27; boarding school, and working part-time at the sixth form of Durham School. Between 1941 and 1956, she was an assistant lecturer (1941–5) and part-time lecturer (1948–56) in English literature, mostly Anglo-Saxon, at Durham University. She received an honorary D.Litt. in 2009. It was in Durham that she met and married her husband, Frederick Stewart, a young Scot who lectured in Geology. She became known as Mary Stewart.

In 1956, the couple moved to Edinburgh. Mary, in her own words, was a &quot;born storyteller&quot; and had been writing stories since the age of three. Following the move to Scotland, she submitted a novel to the publishers Hodder &amp; Stoughton. &quot;Madam, Will You Talk?&quot; was an immediate success, followed by many other successful works over the years.

==Writing career==
Stewart was the best-selling author of many romantic suspense and historical fiction novels. They were well received by critics, due especially to her skillful story-telling and elegant prose. Her novels are also known for their well-crafted settings, many in England but also in such locations as Damascus and the Greek islands, as well as Spain, France, Austria, etc.

She was at the height of her popularity from the late 1950s to the 1980s, when many of her novels were translated into other languages. &quot;The Moon-Spinners&quot;, one of her most popular novels, was also made into a Walt Disney live-action movie. In 2017 &quot;The Little Broomstick&quot; (1971) was adapted into the animated feature film titled &quot;Mary and the Witch&#x27;s Flower&quot;.

Stewart was one of the most prominent writers of the romantic suspense subgenre, blending romance novels and mystery. Critically, her works are considered superior to those of other acclaimed romantic suspense novelists, such as Victoria Holt and Phyllis Whitney. She seamlessly combined the two genres, maintaining a full mystery while focusing on the courtship between two people, so that the process of solving the mystery &quot;helps to illuminate&quot; the hero&#x27;s personality—thereby helping the heroine to fall in love with him.

In the late 1960s a new generation of young readers revived a readership in T. H. White&#x27;s &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; (published in full 1958) and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (published in full 1956), and as a consequence Arthurian and heroic legends regained popularity among a critical mass of readers. Mary Stewart added to this climate by publishing &quot;The Crystal Cave&quot; (1970), the first in what was to become The Merlin Trilogy, later extended by two further novels. The books placed Stewart on the best-seller list many times throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

== Personal life ==
Mary Rainbow met and married her husband, Frederick Stewart, a young Scot lecturer in Geology, whilst they were both working at Durham University. They were married by her father in September 1945 after having met at a VE Day dance; their engagement was announced in &quot;The Times&quot; only one month after they met. At 30, she suffered an ectopic pregnancy, undiagnosed for several weeks, and as a consequence could not have children.

In 1956, they moved to Edinburgh, where he became professor of geology and mineralogy, and later chairman of the Geology Department at University of Edinburgh. 

In 1974, Mary&#x27;s husband Frederick Stewart was knighted and she became Lady Stewart, although she never used the title. Her husband died in 2001.

In semi-retirement Stewart resided in Edinburgh as well as near Loch Awe. An avid gardener, Mary and her husband shared a keen love of nature. She was also fond of her cat Tory, a black and white female, who lived to be eighteen.

Mary Stewart died on 9 May 2014. Her entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography was added in 2022.

<doc id="180457" wikidata="Q849945" url="?curid=180457" title="Keygen">
<text>A key generator (key-gen) is a computer program that generates a product licensing key, such as a serial number, necessary to activate for use of a software application. Keygens may be legitimately distributed by software manufacturers for licensing software in commercial environments where software has been licensed in bulk for an entire site or enterprise, or they may be developed and distributed illegitimately in circumstances of copyright infringement or software piracy.

Illegitimate key generators are typically programmed and distributed by software crackers in the warez scene. These keygens often play music (taking from the tradition of cracktros), which may include the genres dubstep, chiptunes, sampled loops or anything that the programmer desires. Chiptunes are often preferred due to their small size. Keygens can have artistic user interfaces or kept simple and display only a cracking group or cracker&#x27;s logo.

==Software licensing==
A software license is a legal instrument that governs the usage and distribution of computer software. Often, such licenses are enforced by implementing in the software a product activation or digital rights management (DRM) mechanism, seeking to prevent unauthorized use of the software by issuing a code sequence that must be entered into the application when prompted or stored in its configuration.

==Key verification==
Many programs attempt to verify or validate licensing keys over the Internet by establishing a session with a licensing application of the software publisher. Advanced keygens bypass this mechanism, and include additional features for key verification, for example by generating the validation data which would otherwise be returned by an activation server. If the software offers phone activation then the keygen could generate the correct activation code to finish activation. Another method that has been used is activation server emulation, which patches the program memory to &quot;see&quot; the keygen as the &quot;de facto&quot; activation server.

==Multi-keygen==
A multi-keygen is a keygen that offers key generation for multiple software applications. Multi-keygens are sometimes released over singular keygens if a series of products requires the same algorithm for generating product keys. 

These tools simplify the process of obtaining activation keys for users who need access to various software products within the same suite or developed by the same company. By integrating the algorithms for multiple applications into one interface, multi-keygens eliminate the need to manage separate keygens for each program. However, the use of multi-keygens often violates software licensing agreements or constitutes copyright infringement when unauthorized, and may pose risks such as malware or compromised system security.

==Authors and distribution==
Unauthorized keygens that typically violate software licensing terms are written by programmers who engage in reverse engineering and software cracking, often called &quot;crackers&quot;, to circumvent copy protection of software or digital rights management for multimedia.

Keygens are available for download on warez sites or through peer-to-peer (P2P) networks.

==Malware keygens==
Keygens, available through P2P networks or otherwise, can contain malicious payloads. These key generators may or may not generate a valid key, but the embedded malware loaded invisibly at the same time may, for example, be a version of CryptoLocker (ransomware).

Antivirus software may discover malware embedded in keygens; such software often also identifies unauthorized keygens which do not contain a payload as potentially unwanted software, often labelling them with a name such as Win32/Keygen or Win32/Gendows.

===HackTool.Win32.HackAV===
A program designed to assist hacking is defined as HackTool.Win32.HackAV or not-a-virus:Keygen from Kaspersky Labs or as HackTool:Win32/Keygen by Microsoft Malware Protection Center. According to the &quot;Microsoft Malware Protection Center&quot;, its first known detection dates back to 16 July 2009. The following security threats were most often found on PCs that have been related to these tools:
* &quot;Blackhole exploit kit&quot;
* &quot;Win32/Autorun&quot;
* &quot;Win32/Dorkbot&quot;
* &quot;Win32/Obfuscator&quot;

==Keychan==
A key changer or keychan is a variation of a keygen. A keychan is a small piece of software that changes the license key or serial number of a particular piece of proprietary software installed on a computer.

<doc id="180459" wikidata="Q23000" url="?curid=180459" title="Zefram Cochrane">
<text>Zefram Cochrane is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. Created by writer Gene L. Coon, the character first appeared in the 1967 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, in which he was played by Glenn Corbett. James Cromwell later played Cochrane in the 1996 feature film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, the 2001 &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; pilot, &quot;Broken Bow&quot;, and the 2022 &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; Season 3 premiere episode, &quot;Grounded&quot;. Footage of Cromwell from &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; was used in the &quot;Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly Part I&quot;.

As first mentioned in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, and further established by the events of &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, Cochrane is the first human to create a warp drive system, and in 2063, his successful warp speed flight draws the attention of the Vulcans, leading to humanity&#x27;s first official contact with an alien race.

==Fictional character biography==
Cochrane was born in 2030, according to &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (though the novelization of that film gives his year of birth as 2013). He constructed humanity&#x27;s first warp-capable vessel, the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, in Bozeman, Montana, out of an old TitanII nuclear missile. He started the project for financial gain, and found the accounts of his future accolades as told by the crew of the &quot;Enterprise-E&quot; from the future disturbing and embarrassing.

On April 5, 2063, Cochrane made Earth&#x27;s first warp flight. The &quot;Phoenix&#x27;s&quot; warp flight was detected by a Vulcan survey ship, the &quot;T&#x27;Plana Hath&quot;, which then made peaceful first contact with humans, including Cochrane, at the &quot;Phoenix&#x27;s&quot; launch site.

The aphorism &quot;Don&#x27;t try to be a great man, just be a man. And let history make its own judgments,&quot; is attributed to Cochrane, who is said to have uttered it in 2073. In 2119, Cochrane was present at the dedication of Earth&#x27;s first Warp5 Complex, as seen in a video viewed by the characters in the 2001 pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. On that occasion, Cochrane stated, &quot;This engine will let us go boldly where no man has gone before&quot;, making him the earliest known person in the fictional timeline of &quot;Trek&quot; to say that phrase.

The &quot;Phoenix&quot;&#x27;s launch facility became a historical monument. A 20-meter marble statue was erected there, depicting Cochrane heroically reaching toward the future. Cochrane&#x27;s name became revered among humans, with entire universities, cities and planets named after him. &quot;Enterprise-D&quot; and &quot;Enterprise-E&quot; Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge, for example, attended Zefram Cochrane High School.

According to the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, Cochrane was presumed dead after disappearing from Alpha Centauri in 2117 (though the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Broken Bow&quot; later retcons the year of Cochrane&#x27;s disappearance to be 2119 or later). James T. Kirk, Spock and Leonard McCoy find Cochrane living on an asteroid with a being he calls the Companion, an ethereal presence of pure energy who rejuvenated the aged, dying Cochrane 150 years earlier, and has held him captive— and in a state of youth and vigor— ever since. Nancy Hedford, who was traveling with the three Starfleet officers, is an ill Federation commissioner. The Companion, who loves Cochrane, merges with the commissioner, ridding her of her illness and providing the Companion with a corporeal (but now mortal) form. The combined entity no longer has the power to force Cochrane to stay with her, but Cochrane chooses to stay out of love and gratitude. Before departing, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy promise not to reveal Cochrane&#x27;s existence.

===Mirror Universe===

In the Mirror Universe, rather than reciprocating the Vulcans&#x27; peaceful greeting, Cochrane and the other humans kill the Vulcans and loot their ship. Humans conquer other worlds as part of the brutal Terran Empire.

==Appearance==

In &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, Cochrane was played by Glenn Corbett, who was 34 at the time of that episode&#x27;s airing. In &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, Cochrane was played by the 56-year-old James Cromwell, at a point when the character, in 2063, would have been approximately 33 years old. &quot;The Star Trek Encyclopedia&quot; explains this discrepancy by theorizing that Cochrane&#x27;s aged appearance in 2063 was the result of radiation poisoning, and that when he encountered the Companion, the Companion reversed these effects, and restored his youthful appearance.

==Non-canonical treatment==

In the 1994 novel &quot;Federation&quot; by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, whose publication predated the release of &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; by two years, Cochrane had been portrayed as a human of Earth origin. The novel suggested he retired to Alpha Centauri at some point between his first warp flight and his disappearance. This follows a suggestion made in the &quot;Star Trek Chronology&quot;, on the assumption humans could not have settled the Alpha Centauri system prior to the warp drive&#x27;s invention.

In the novel, Cochrane&#x27;s warp experiments are the result of a mysterious billionaire&#x27;s financial and idealistic support in the period between the Eugenics Wars and World WarIII. His self-identification with Alpha Centauri results from it being the destination of his first warp voyage and his subsequent founding role in the first colony in the system. His life&#x27;s story beyond his encounter with Kirk at Gamma Canaris in &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; is depicted up to his death during the events of the third season of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

In the 1989 reference book &quot;Worlds of the Federation&quot;, author Shane Johnson writes of Zefram Cochrane being a native to the Alpha Centauri system (which is populated by humans transplanted from Earth in antiquity) who is contacted by the United Nations spaceship &quot;Icarus&quot;, a sublight vessel which is the first human ship to travel to another solar system.

Lacking a common language and before the invention of the universal translator, he used mathematics alone to communicate his ideas for a faster-than-light drive system and its prototype, the WD-1.

Cochrane also appeared in issue #49 of Gold Key Comics&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, along with Nancy Hedford and the Companion.

<doc id="180464" wikidata="Q612688" url="?curid=180464" title="The Fountainhead">
<text>The Fountainhead is a 1943 novel by Russian-American author Ayn Rand, her first major literary success. The novel&#x27;s protagonist, Howard Roark, is an intransigent young architect who battles against conventional standards and refuses to compromise with an architectural establishment unwilling to accept innovation. Roark embodies what Rand believed to be the ideal man, and his struggle reflects Rand&#x27;s belief that individualism is superior to collectivism.

Roark is opposed by what he calls &quot;second-handers&quot;, who value conformity over independence and integrity. These include Roark&#x27;s former classmate, Peter Keating, who succeeds by following popular styles but turns to Roark for help with design problems. Ellsworth Toohey, a socialist architecture critic who uses his influence to promote his political and social agenda, tries to destroy Roark&#x27;s career. Tabloid newspaper publisher Gail Wynand seeks to shape popular opinion; he befriends Roark, then betrays him when public opinion turns in a direction he cannot control. The novel&#x27;s most controversial character is Roark&#x27;s lover, Dominique Francon. She believes that non-conformity has no chance of winning, so she alternates between helping Roark and working to undermine him.

Twelve publishers rejected the manuscript before an editor at the Bobbs-Merrill Company risked his job to get it published. Contemporary reviewers&#x27; opinions were polarized. Some praised the novel as a powerful paean to individualism, while others thought it overlong and lacking sympathetic characters. Initial sales were slow, but the book gained a following by word of mouth and became a bestseller. More than 10 million copies of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; have been sold worldwide, and it has been translated into more than 30 languages. The novel attracted a new following for Rand and has enjoyed a lasting influence, especially among architects, entrepreneurs, American conservatives, and libertarians.

The novel has been adapted into other media several times. An illustrated version was syndicated in newspapers in 1945. Warner Bros. produced a film version in 1949; Rand wrote the screenplay, and Gary Cooper played Roark. Critics panned the film, which did not recoup its budget; several directors and writers have considered developing a new film adaptation. In 2014, Belgian theater director Ivo van Hove created a stage adaptation, which received mixed reviews.

==Plot==

In early 1922, Howard Roark is expelled from the architecture department of the Stanton Institute of Technology because he has not adhered to the school&#x27;s preference for historical convention in building design. Roark goes to New York City and gets a job with Henry Cameron. Cameron was once a renowned architect, but now gets few commissions. In the meantime, Roark&#x27;s popular but vacuous fellow student and housemate Peter Keating (whom Roark sometimes helped with projects) graduates with high honors. He too moves to New York, where he has been offered a position with the prestigious architecture firm, Francon &amp; Heyer. Keating ingratiates himself with Guy Francon and works to remove rivals among his coworkers. After Francon&#x27;s partner, Lucius Heyer, suffers a fatal stroke brought on by Keating&#x27;s antagonism, Francon chooses Keating to replace him. Meanwhile, Roark and Cameron create inspired work, but struggle financially.

After Cameron retires, Keating hires Roark, whom Francon soon fires for refusing to design a building in the classical style. Roark works briefly at another firm, then opens his own office but has trouble finding clients and closes it down. He gets a job in a granite quarry owned by Francon. There he meets Francon&#x27;s daughter Dominique, a columnist for &quot;The New York Banner&quot;, while she is staying at her family&#x27;s estate nearby. They are immediately attracted to each other, leading to a rough sexual encounter that Dominique later calls a rape. Shortly after, Roark is notified that a client is ready to start a new building, and he returns to New York. Dominique also returns to New York and learns that Roark is an architect. She attacks his work in public, but visits him for secret sexual encounters.

Ellsworth M. Toohey, who writes a popular architecture column in the &quot;Banner&quot;, is an outspoken socialist who shapes public opinion through his column and a circle of influential associates. Toohey sets out to destroy Roark through a smear campaign. He recommends Roark to Hopton Stoddard, a wealthy acquaintance who wants to build a Temple of the Human Spirit. Roark&#x27;s unusual design includes a nude statue modeled on Dominique; Toohey persuades Stoddard to sue Roark for malpractice. Toohey and several architects (including Keating) testify at the trial that Roark is incompetent as an architect for his rejection of historical styles. Dominique also argues for the prosecution in tones that can be interpreted to be speaking more in Roark&#x27;s defense than for the plaintiff, but he loses the case. Dominique decides that since she cannot have the world she wants, in which men like Roark are recognized for their greatness, she will live entirely in the world she has, which shuns Roark and praises Keating. She marries Keating and turns herself over to him, doing and saying whatever he wants, and actively persuading potential clients to hire him instead of Roark.

To win Keating a prestigious commission offered by Gail Wynand, the owner and editor-in-chief of the &quot;Banner&quot;, Dominique agrees to sleep with Wynand. Wynand is so strongly attracted to Dominique that he pays Keating to divorce her, after which Wynand and Dominique marry. Wanting to build a home for himself and his new wife, Wynand discovers that Roark designed every building he likes and so hires him. Roark and Wynand become close friends; Wynand is unaware of Roark&#x27;s past relationship with Dominique.

Washed up and out of the public eye, Keating pleads with Toohey to use his influence to get the commission for the much-sought-after Cortlandt housing project. Keating knows his most successful projects were aided by Roark, so he asks for Roark&#x27;s help in designing Cortlandt. Roark agrees in exchange for complete anonymity and Keating&#x27;s promise that it will be built exactly as designed. After taking a long vacation with Wynand, Roark returns to find that Keating was not able to prevent major changes from being made in Cortlandt&#x27;s construction. Roark dynamites the project to prevent the subversion of his vision.

Roark is arrested and his action is widely condemned, but Wynand decides to use his papers to defend his friend. This unpopular stance hurts the circulation of his newspapers, and Wynand&#x27;s employees go on strike after Wynand dismisses Toohey for disobeying him and criticizing Roark. Faced with the prospect of closing the paper, Wynand gives in and publishes a denunciation of Roark. At his trial, Roark makes a lengthy speech about the value of ego and integrity, and he is found not guilty. Dominique leaves Wynand for Roark. Wynand, who has betrayed his own values by attacking Roark, finally grasps the nature of the power he thought he held. He shuts down the &quot;Banner&quot; and commissions a final building from Roark, a skyscraper that will serve as a monument to human achievement. Eighteen months later, the Wynand Building is under construction. Dominique, now Roark&#x27;s wife, enters the site to meet him atop its steel framework.

==Major characters==

===Howard Roark===

Rand&#x27;s stated goal in writing fiction was to portray her vision of an ideal man. The character of Howard Roark, the protagonist of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, was the first instance where she believed she had achieved this. Roark embodies Rand&#x27;s egoistic moral ideals, especially the virtues of independence and integrity.

The character of Roark was at least partly inspired by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Rand described the inspiration as limited to specific ideas he had about architecture and &quot;the pattern of his career&quot;. She denied that Wright had anything to do with the philosophy expressed by Roark or the events of the plot. Rand&#x27;s denials have not stopped commentators from claiming stronger connections between Wright and Roark. Wright equivocated about whether he thought Roark was based on him, sometimes implying that he did, at other times denying it. Wright biographer Ada Louise Huxtable described significant differences between Wright&#x27;s philosophy and Rand&#x27;s and quoted him, declaring, &quot;I deny the paternity and refuse to marry the mother.&quot; Architecture critic Martin Filler said that Roark resembles the Swiss-French modernist architect Le Corbusier more closely than Wright.

===Peter Keating===
In contrast to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark&#x27;s classmate in architecture school, two years ahead of him, Keating does not really want to be an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this, as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: he chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique&#x27;s beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating&#x27;s career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.

Rand did not use a specific architect as a model for Keating. Her inspiration for the character came from a neighbor she knew while working in Hollywood in the early 1930s. Rand asked this young woman to explain her goals in life. The woman&#x27;s response was focused on social comparisons: The neighbor wanted her material possessions and social standing to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.

===Dominique Francon===

Dominique Francon is the heroine of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, described by Rand as &quot;the woman for a man like Howard Roark&quot;. Rand described Dominique as similar to herself &quot;in a bad mood&quot;. For most of the novel, the character operates from a mistaken belief that a corrupt world will destroy the things she values. Believing that the values she admires cannot survive in the real world, she chooses to turn away from them so that the world cannot harm her. Only at the end of the novel does she accept that she can be happy and survive.

===Gail Wynand===
Gail Wynand is a wealthy newspaper mogul who rose from a destitute childhood in the ghettoes of New York (Hell&#x27;s Kitchen) to control much of the city&#x27;s print media. While Wynand shares many of the character qualities of Roark, his success is dependent upon his ability to pander to public opinion. Rand presents this as a tragic flaw that eventually leads to his downfall. In her journals Rand described Wynand as &quot;the man who could have been&quot; a heroic individualist, contrasting him to Roark, &quot;the man who can be and is&quot;. Some elements of Wynand&#x27;s character were inspired by real-life newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, including Hearst&#x27;s yellow journalism and mixed success in attempts to gain political influence. Wynand ultimately fails in his attempts to wield power, losing his newspaper, his wife (Dominique), and his friendship with Roark. The character has been interpreted as a representation of the master morality described by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche; his tragic nature illustrates Rand&#x27;s rejection of Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy. In Rand&#x27;s view, a person like Wynand, who seeks power over others, is as much a &quot;second-hander&quot; as a conformist such as Keating.

===Ellsworth Toohey===

Ellsworth Monkton Toohey is Roark&#x27;s antagonist. He is Rand&#x27;s personification of evilthe most active and self-aware villain in any of her novels. Toohey is a socialist and represents the spirit of collectivism more generally. He styles himself as representative of the will of the masses but his actual desire is for power over others. He controls individual victims by destroying their sense of self-worth and seeks broader power (over &quot;the world&quot;, as he declares to Keating in a moment of candor) by promoting the ideals of ethical altruism and a rigorous egalitarianism that treats all people and achievements as equally valuable. Rand used her memory of the democratic socialist British Labour Party chairman Harold Laski to help her imagine what Toohey would do in a given situation. She attended a New York lecture by Laski as part of gathering material for the novel, following which she changed the physical appearance of the character to be similar to that of Laski. New York intellectuals Lewis Mumford and Clifton Fadiman also helped inspire the character.

==History==

===Background and development===
When Rand first arrived in New York as an immigrant from the Soviet Union in 1926, she was greatly impressed by the Manhattan skyline&#x27;s towering skyscrapers, which she saw as symbols of freedom, and resolved that she would write about them. In 1927, Rand was working as a junior screenwriter for movie producer Cecil B. DeMille when he asked her to write a script for what would become the 1928 film &quot;Skyscraper&quot;. The original story by Dudley Murphy was about two construction workers working on a skyscraper who are rivals for a woman&#x27;s love. Rand rewrote it, transforming the rivals into architects. One of them, Howard Kane, was an idealist dedicated to erecting the skyscraper despite enormous obstacles. The film would have ended with Kane standing atop the completed skyscraper. DeMille rejected Rand&#x27;s script, and the completed film followed Murphy&#x27;s original idea. Rand&#x27;s version contained elements she would use in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;.

In 1928, Rand made notes for a proposed, but never written, novel titled &quot;The Little Street&quot;. Rand&#x27;s notes for it contain elements that carried over into her work on &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. David Harriman, who edited the notes for the posthumously published &quot;Journals of Ayn Rand&quot; (1997), described the story&#x27;s villain as a preliminary version of the character Ellsworth Toohey, and this villain&#x27;s assassination by the protagonist as prefiguring the attempted assassination of Toohey.
Rand began &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (originally titled &quot;Second-Hand Lives&quot;) following the completion of her first novel, &quot;We the Living&quot;, in 1934. That earlier novel was based in part on people and events familiar to Rand; the new novel, on the other hand, focused on the less-familiar world of architecture. She therefore conducted extensive research that included reading many biographies and other books about architecture. She also worked as an unpaid typist in the office of architect Ely Jacques Kahn. Rand began her notes for the new novel in December 1935.

Rand wanted to write a novel that was less overtly political than &quot;We the Living&quot;, to avoid being viewed as &quot;a &#x27;one-theme&#x27; author&quot;. As she developed the story, she began to see more political meaning in the novel&#x27;s ideas about individualism. Rand also planned to introduce the novel&#x27;s four sections with quotes from Friedrich Nietzsche, whose ideas had influenced her own intellectual development, but she eventually decided that Nietzsche&#x27;s ideas were too different from hers. She edited the final manuscript to remove the quotes and other allusions to him.

Rand&#x27;s work on &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was repeatedly interrupted. In 1937, she took a break from it to write a novella called &quot;Anthem&quot;. One night in June 1938, she almost gave up on writing the book. Her husband Frank O&#x27;Connor encouraged her in an hours-long conversation, ultimately convincing her not to give up. She also completed a stage adaptation of &quot;We the Living&quot; that ran briefly in 1940. That same year, she became active in politics. She first worked as a volunteer in Wendell Willkie&#x27;s presidential campaign and then attempted to form a group for conservative intellectuals. As her royalties from earlier projects ran out, she began doing freelance work as a script reader for movie studios. When Rand finally found a publisher, the novel was only one-third complete.

===Publication history===
Although she was a previously published novelist and had a successful Broadway play, Rand had difficulty finding a publisher for &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. Macmillan Publishing, which had published &quot;We the Living&quot;, rejected the book after Rand insisted they provide more publicity for her new novel than they had done for the first one. Rand&#x27;s agent began submitting the book to other publishers; in 1938, Knopf signed a contract to publish the book. When Rand was only a quarter done with the manuscript by October 1940, Knopf canceled her contract. Several other publishers rejected the book. When Rand&#x27;s agent began to criticize the novel, Rand fired the agent and decided to handle submissions herself. Twelve publishers (including Macmillan and Knopf) rejected the book.

While Rand was working as a script reader for Paramount Pictures, her boss put her in touch with the Bobbs-Merrill Company. A recently hired editor, Archibald Ogden, liked the book, but two internal reviewers gave conflicting opinions. One said it was a great book that would never sell; the other said it was trash but would sell well. Ogden&#x27;s boss, Bobbs-Merrill president D.L. Chambers, decided to reject the book. Ogden responded by wiring to the head office, &quot;If this is not the book for you, then I am not the editor for you.&quot; His strong stand won Rand the contract on December 10, 1941. She also got a $1,000 advance so she could work full-time to complete the novel by January 1, 1943.

Rand worked long hours through 1942 to complete the final two-thirds of her manuscript, which she delivered on December 31, 1942. Rand&#x27;s working title for the book was &quot;Second-Hand Lives&quot;, but Ogden pointed out that this emphasized the story&#x27;s villains. Rand offered &quot;The Mainspring&quot; as an alternative, but this title had been recently used for another book. She then used a thesaurus and found &#x27;fountainhead&#x27; as a synonym. &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was published on May 7, 1943, with 7,500 copies in the first printing. Initial sales were slow, but they began to rise in late 1943, driven primarily by word of mouth. The novel began appearing on bestseller lists in 1944. It reached number six on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list in August 1945, over two years after its initial publication. By 1956, the hardcover edition sold over 700,000 copies. The first paperback edition was published by the New American Library in 1952.

A 25th anniversary edition was issued by the New American Library in 1971, including a new introduction by Rand. The cover of the twenty-fifth anniversary edition featured a painting by Frank O&#x27;Connor titled &quot;Man Also Rises&quot;. In 1993, a 50th anniversary edition from Bobbs-Merrill added an afterword by Rand&#x27;s heir, Leonard Peikoff. The novel has been translated into more than 30 languages.

Some passages were removed from the text prior to the publication, the most important of which concerns the relationship of Howard Roark with actress Vesta Dunning, a character that was cut from the finished novel. The deleted passages were first published posthumously in &quot;The Early Ayn Rand&quot; in 1984.

==Themes==

===Individualism===
Rand indicated that the primary theme of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was &quot;individualism versus collectivism, not in politics but within a man&#x27;s soul&quot;. Philosopher Douglas Den Uyl identified the individualism presented in the novel as being specifically of an American kind, portrayed in the context of that country&#x27;s society and institutions. Apart from scenes such as Roark&#x27;s courtroom defense of the American concept of individual rights, she avoided direct discussion of political issues. As historian James Baker described it, &quot;&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; hardly mentions politics or economics, despite the fact that it was born in the 1930s. Nor does it deal with world affairs, although it was written during World War II. It is about one man against the system, and it does not permit other matters to intrude.&quot; Early drafts of the novel included more explicit political references, but Rand removed them from the finished text.

===Architecture===

Rand chose the profession of architecture as the background for her novel, although she knew nothing about the field beforehand. As a field that combines art, technology, and business, it allowed her to illustrate her primary themes in multiple areas. Rand later wrote that architects provide &quot;both art and a basic need of men&#x27;s survival&quot;. In a speech to a chapter of the American Institute of Architects, Rand drew a connection between architecture and individualism, saying time periods that had improvements in architecture were also those that had more freedom for the individual.

Roark&#x27;s modernist approach to architecture is contrasted with that of most of the other architects in the novel. In the opening chapter, the dean of his architecture school tells Roark that the best architecture must copy the past rather than innovate or improve. Roark repeatedly loses jobs with architectural firms and commissions from clients because he is unwilling to copy conventional architectural styles. In contrast, Keating&#x27;s mimicry of convention brings him top honors in school and an immediate job offer. The same conflict between innovation and tradition is reflected in the career of Roark&#x27;s mentor, Henry Cameron.

===Philosophy===
Den Uyl calls &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; a &quot;philosophical novel&quot;, meaning that it addresses philosophical ideas and offers a specific philosophical viewpoint about those ideas. In the years following the publication of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, Rand developed a philosophical system that she called Objectivism. &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; does not contain this explicit philosophy, and Rand did not write the novel primarily to convey philosophical ideas. Nonetheless, Rand included three excerpts from the novel in &quot;For the New Intellectual&quot;, a 1961 collection of her writings that she described as an outline of Objectivism. Peikoff used many quotes and examples from &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; in his 1991 book on Rand&#x27;s philosophy, &quot;&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; polarized critics and received mixed reviews upon its release. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Lorine Pruette praised Rand as writing &quot;brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly&quot;, stating that she had &quot;written a hymn in praise of the individual&quot; that would force readers to rethink basic ideas. Writing for the same newspaper, Orville Prescott called the novel &quot;disastrous&quot; with a plot containing &quot;coils and convolutions&quot; and a &quot;crude cast of characters&quot;. Benjamin DeCasseres, a columnist for the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot;, described Roark as &quot;one of the most inspiring characters in modern American literature&quot;. Rand sent DeCasseres a letter thanking him for explaining the book&#x27;s themes about individualism when many other reviewers did not. There were other positive reviews, although Rand dismissed many of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications. A number of negative reviews focused on the length of the novel, such as one that called it &quot;a whale of a book&quot; and another that said &quot;anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing&quot;. Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand&#x27;s style &quot;offensively pedestrian&quot;.

The character of Dominique Francon has provoked varied reactions from commentators. Philosopher Chris Matthew Sciabarra called her &quot;one of the more bizarre characters in the novel&quot;. Literature scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein called her &quot;an interesting case study in perverseness&quot;. Writer Tore Boeckmann described her as a character with conflicting beliefs and saw her actions as a logical representation of how those conflicts might play out.

In the years following its initial publication, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; has received relatively little attention from literary critics. Assessing the novel&#x27;s legacy, philosopher Douglas Den Uyl described &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; as relatively neglected compared to her later novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; and said, &quot;our problem is to find those topics that arise clearly with &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and yet do not force us to read it simply through the eyes of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.&quot; Among critics who have addressed it, some consider &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; to be Rand&#x27;s best novel, although in some cases this assessment is tempered by an overall negative judgment of Rand&#x27;s writings. Purely negative evaluations have also continued; a 2011 overview of American literature said &quot;mainstream literary culture dismissed [] in the 1940s and continues to dismiss it&quot;.

===Feminist criticisms===
Feminist critics have condemned Roark and Dominique&#x27;s first sexual encounter, accusing Rand of endorsing rape. Feminist critics have attacked the scene as representative of an antifeminist viewpoint in Rand&#x27;s works that makes women subservient to men. Susan Brownmiller, in her 1975 work &quot;Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape&quot;, denounced what she called &quot;Rand&#x27;s philosophy of rape&quot;, for portraying women as wanting &quot;humiliation at the hands of a superior man&quot;. She called Rand &quot;a traitor to her own sex&quot;. Susan Love Brown said the scene presents Rand&#x27;s view of sex as sadomasochism involving &quot;feminine subordination and passivity&quot;. Barbara Grizzuti Harrison suggested that women who enjoy such &quot;masochistic fantasies&quot; are &quot;damaged&quot; and have low self-esteem. While Mimi Reisel Gladstein found elements to admire in Rand&#x27;s female protagonists, she said that readers who have &quot;a raised consciousness about the nature of rape&quot; would disapprove of Rand&#x27;s &quot;romanticized rapes&quot;.

Rand&#x27;s posthumously published working notes for the novel indicate that when she started on the book in 1936, she conceived of Roark&#x27;s character that &quot;were it necessary, he could rape her and feel justified&quot;. She denied that what happened in the finished novel was actually rape, referring to it as &quot;rape by engraved invitation&quot;. She said Dominique wanted and &quot;all but invited&quot; the act, citing, among other things, a passage where Dominique scratches a marble slab in her bedroom to invite Roark to repair it. A true rape, Rand said, would be &quot;a dreadful crime&quot;. Defenders of the novel have agreed with this interpretation. In an essay specifically explaining this scene, Andrew Bernstein wrote that although much &quot;confusion&quot; exists about it, the descriptions in the novel provide &quot;conclusive&quot; evidence of Dominique&#x27;s strong attraction to Roark and her desire to have sex with him. Individualist feminist Wendy McElroy said that while Dominique is &quot;thoroughly taken&quot;, there is nonetheless &quot;clear indication&quot; that Dominique both gave consent for and enjoyed the experience. Both Bernstein and McElroy saw the interpretations of feminists such as Brownmiller as based in a false understanding of sexuality.

===Effect on Rand&#x27;s career===

Although Rand had some mainstream success previously with her play &quot;Night of January 16th&quot; and had two previously published novels, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was a major breakthrough in her career. It brought her lasting fame and financial success. She sold the movie rights to &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay for the adaptation. In April 1944, she signed a multiyear contract with movie producer Hal Wallis to write original screenplays and adaptations of other writers&#x27; works.

The success of the novel brought Rand new publishing opportunities. Bobbs-Merrill offered to publish a nonfiction book expanding on the ethical ideas presented in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. Though this book was never completed, a portion of the material was used for an article in the January 1944 issue of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Rand was also able to get an American publisher for &quot;Anthem&quot;, which previously had been published in England, but not in the United States. When she was ready to submit &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; to publishers, over a dozen competed to acquire the new book.

&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; also attracted a new group of fans who were attracted to its philosophical ideas. When she moved back to New York in 1951, she gathered a group of these admirers to whom she referred publicly as &quot;the Class of &#x27;43&quot; in reference to the year &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was published. The group evolved into the core of the Objectivist movement that promoted the philosophical ideas from Rand&#x27;s writing.

===Cultural influence===
&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; has continued to have strong sales throughout the last century into the current one. By 2023, it had sold over 10 million copies. It has been referred to in a variety of popular entertainments, including movies, television series, and other novels. The year 1943 also saw the publication of &quot;The God of the Machine&quot; by Isabel Paterson and &quot;The Discovery of Freedom&quot; by Rose Wilder Lane. Rand, Lane, and Paterson have been referred to as the founding mothers of the American libertarian movement with the publication of these works. For example, journalist John Chamberlain credited these works with converting him from socialism to what he called &quot;an older American philosophy&quot; of libertarian and conservative ideas. Literature professor Philip R. Yannella said the novel is &quot;a central text of American conservative and libertarian political culture&quot;. In the United Kingdom, Conservative Party politician Sajid Javid has spoken of the novel&#x27;s influence on him and how he regularly rereads the courtroom scene from Roark&#x27;s criminal trial.

The book has a particular appeal to young people, an appeal that led historian James Baker to describe it as &quot;more important than its detractors think, although not as important as Rand fans imagine&quot;. Philosopher Allan Bloom said the novel is &quot;hardly literature&quot; but that when he asked his students which books mattered to them, someone always was influenced by &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. Journalist Nora Ephron wrote that she had loved the novel when she was 18, but admitted that she &quot;missed the point&quot;, which she suggested is largely subliminal sexual metaphor. Ephron wrote that she decided upon rereading that &quot;it is better read when one is young enough to miss the point. Otherwise, one cannot help thinking it is a very silly book.&quot;

Multiple architects have cited &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; as an inspiration for their work. Architect Fred Stitt, founder of the San Francisco Institute of Architecture, dedicated a book to his &quot;first architectural mentor, Howard Roark&quot;. According to architectural photographer Julius Shulman, Rand&#x27;s work &quot;brought architecture into the public&#x27;s focus for the first time&quot;. He said &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was not only influential among 20th century architects, but moreover &quot;was one, first, front and center in the life of every architect who was a modern architect&quot;. The novel also had a significant impact on the public perception of architecture. During his 2016 presidential campaign, real estate developer Donald Trump praised the novel, saying he identified with Roark. Roark Capital Group, a private equity firm, is named for the character Howard Roark.

==Adaptations==

===Film===

In 1949, Warner Bros. released a film based on the book, starring Gary Cooper as Howard Roark, Patricia Neal as Dominique Francon, Raymond Massey as Gail Wynand, and Kent Smith as Peter Keating. Rand, who had previous experience as a screenwriter, was hired to adapt her own novel. The film was directed by King Vidor. It grossed $2.1 million, $400,000 less than its production budget. Critics panned the movie. Negative reviews appeared in publications ranging from newspapers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, to movie industry outlets such as &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, to magazines such as &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;.

In letters written at the time, Rand&#x27;s reaction to the film was positive. She said it was the most faithful adaptation of a novel ever made in Hollywood. and a &quot;real triumph&quot;. Sales of the novel increased as a result of interest spurred by the film. She displayed a more negative attitude later, saying she disliked the entire movie and complaining about its editing, acting, and other elements. Rand said she would never sell rights to another novel to a film company that did not allow her to pick the director and screenwriter, as well as edit the film.

Various filmmakers have expressed interest in doing new adaptations of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, although none of these potential films has begun production. In the 1970s, writer-director Michael Cimino entered a deal to film his own script for United Artists starring Clint Eastwood as Roark, but postponed the project in favor of abortive biographical films on Janis Joplin and Frank Costello. The deal collapsed after the failure of Cimino&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, which caused United Artists to refuse to finance any more of his films. Cimino continued to hope to film the script until his death in 2016.

In 1992, producer James Hill optioned the rights and selected Phil Joanou to direct. In the 2000s, Oliver Stone was interested in directing a new adaptation; Brad Pitt was reportedly under consideration to play Roark. In a March 2016 interview, director Zack Snyder expressed interest in doing a new film adaptation of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, an interest he repeated in 2018. Snyder said in 2019 that he was no longer pursuing the adaptation. In 2024, he said that he unsuccessfully pitched a television series adaptation to Netflix.

===Play===
The Dutch theater company Toneelgroep Amsterdam presented a Dutch-language adaptation for the stage at the Holland Festival in June 2014. The company&#x27;s artistic director Ivo van Hove wrote and directed the adaptation. Ramsey Nasr played Howard Roark, with Halina Reijn playing Dominique Francon. The four-hour production used video projections to show close-ups of the actors and Roark&#x27;s drawings, as well as backgrounds of the New York skyline. After its debut the production went on tour, appearing in Barcelona, Spain, in early July 2014, and at the Festival d&#x27;Avignon in France later that month. The play appeared at the Odéon-Théâtre de l&#x27;Europe in Paris in November 2016, and at the LG Arts Center in Seoul from March 31 to April 2, 2017. The play had its first American production at the Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s Next Wave Festival, where it ran from November 28 to December 2, 2017.

The European productions of the play received mostly positive reviews. The Festival d&#x27;Avignon production received positive from the French newspapers &quot;La Croix&quot;, &quot;Les Échos&quot;, and &quot;Le Monde&quot;, as well as from the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, whose reviewer described it as &quot;electrifying theatre&quot;. The French magazine &quot;Télérama&quot; gave the Avignon production a negative review, calling the source material inferior and complaining about the use of video screens on the set, while another French magazine, , complimented the staging and acting of the Odéon production.

American critics gave mostly negative reviews of the Next Wave Festival production. Helen Shaw&#x27;s review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said the adaptation was unwatchable because it portrayed Rand&#x27;s characters and views seriously without undercutting them The reviewer for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; said the play was too long and that Hove had approached Rand&#x27;s &quot;noxious&quot; book with too much reverence. In a mixed review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Ben Brantley complimented Hove for capturing Rand&#x27;s &quot;sheer pulp appeal&quot;, but described the material as &quot;hokum with a whole lot of ponderous speeches&quot;. A review for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; complimented van Hove&#x27;s ability to portray Rand&#x27;s message, but said the play was an hour too long.

===Television===

The novel was adapted in Urdu for the Pakistan Television Network in 1980 under the title &quot;Teesra Kinara&quot;. The serial starred Rahat Kazmi, who also wrote the adaptation. Kazmi&#x27;s wife, Sahira Kazmi, played Dominique. In the US, the novel was parodied in an episode of the animated adventure series &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot;, as well as in season 20 of the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the last part of the episode &quot;Four Great Women and a Manicure&quot;.

===Other adaptations===
In 1944, &quot;Omnibook Magazine&quot; produced an abridged edition of the novel that was sold to members of the United States Armed Forces. Rand was annoyed that Bobbs-Merrill allowed the edited version to be published without her approval of the text. King Features Syndicate approached Rand the following year about creating a condensed, illustrated version of the novel for syndication in newspapers. Rand agreed, provided that she could oversee the editing and approve the proposed illustrations of her characters, which were provided by Frank Godwin. The 30-part series began on December 24, 1945, and ran in over 35 newspapers. Rand biographer Anne Heller complimented the adaptation, calling it &quot;handsomely illustrated&quot;. To provide publicity for a translation of the novel into French, the Swiss publisher Jeheber allowed the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation to air a radio play adaptation in the late 1940s. Rand did not authorize the adaptation and learned about it through a letter from a Swiss fan in 1949.

<text>The Detroit Electric was an electric car produced by the Anderson Electric Car Company in Detroit, Michigan. The company built 13,000 electric cars from 1907 to 1939.

The marque was revived in 2008 by Albert Lam, former Group CEO of the Lotus Engineering Group and executive director of Lotus Cars of England. to produce modern all-electric cars by Detroit Electric Holding Ltd. of the Netherlands.

==History==



Anderson had previously been known as the Anderson Carriage Company (until 1911), producing carriages and buggies since 1884. Production of the electric automobile, powered by a rechargeable lead acid battery, began in 1907. For an additional , an Edison nickel-iron battery was available from 1911 to 1916. The cars were advertised as reliably getting between battery recharging, although in one test a Detroit Electric ran on a single charge. Top speed was only about , but this was considered adequate for driving within city or town limits at the time.

The company production was at its peak in the 1910s selling around 1000 to 2000 cars a year. Towards the end of the decade, the Electric was helped by the high price of gasoline during World War I. In 1920, the name of the Anderson company was changed to &quot;The Detroit Electric Car Company&quot; as the car maker separated from the body business (it became part of Murray Body) and the motor/controller business (Elwell-Parker). As improved internal combustion engine automobiles became more common and inexpensive, sales of the Electric dropped in the 1920s.

Alfred O. Dunk acquired the company in 1927 following the death of Anderson. The business continued to operate for some years, building cars in response to orders by word of mouth. The last Detroit Electric was shipped on February 23, 1939, though they were still available until 1942. In its final years the cars were manufactured only in very small numbers. Between 1907 and 1939 a total of 13,000 electric cars were built.

Notable people who owned Detroit Electrics cars included Thomas Edison, Lizzie Borden, Charles Proteus Steinmetz, Mamie Eisenhower, and John D. Rockefeller Jr. who had a pair of Model 46 roadsters. Clara Ford, the wife of Henry Ford, drove Detroit Electrics from 1908, when Henry bought her a Model C coupe with a special child seat, through the late teens. Her third car was a 1914 Model 47 brougham.

Genzo Shimazu, founder of the Japanese battery company Japan Storage Battery Co. &quot;(known today as GS Yuasa)&quot;, imported two Detroit Electric cars shortly after starting the company in 1917. Using his own batteries, he drove them around Tokyo to demonstrate the effectiveness of battery technology. Shimazu used them as daily drivers for 29 years until his retirement in 1946. With a return of interest in electric vehicles at the beginning of the 21st century, GS Yuasa restored one of the vehicles to running condition with a modern lithium-ion 24-volt battery in 2009, registering the date, May 20, as Electric Car Day in Japan.

Detroit Electrics can be seen in various automobile museums, such as the Forney Transportation Museum in Denver, Colorado; Belgian AutoWorld Museum in Brussels; The Henry Ford in Dearborn, Michigan; and the Museum Autovision in Altlußheim, Germany. A restored and operational Detroit Electric, owned by Union College, is located in the Edison Tech Center in Schenectady, NY. Another restored and operational 1914 with the Edison battery option (Nickel-Iron vs. Lead Acid) is located at the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada. One 1914 model Is also located, restored and fully operational, near Frankenmuth, Michigan and another is at the Motor Museum of Western Australia in Perth, Australia, a 1914 Brougham in excellent condition.

==In popular culture==
The Disney cartoon character Grandma Duck drives a red car with license plate number &quot;1902&quot; that appears similar to a Detroit Electric.
A Detroit Electric is featured in the Perry Mason episode The Case of the Borrowed Baby (season 5, episode 26, broadcast date April 14, 1962).
The Detroit Electric Car Company is featured in D.E. Johnson&#x27;s crime novel &quot;The Detroit Electric Scheme&quot; published in September, 2010.

Comedian Jay Leno restored (restomodded) a Detroit Electric between 2015 and 2020.

<text>EasyJet plc (styled as easyJet) is a British multinational low-cost airline group headquartered at London Luton Airport. It operates domestic and international scheduled services on 927 routes in more than 34 countries via its affiliate airlines EasyJet UK, EasyJet Switzerland, and EasyJet Europe. The company employs circa 13,000 people, based throughout Europe but mainly in the UK. EasyJet plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. 

Since its establishment in 1995, EasyJet has expanded through a combination of acquisitions, and base openings fuelled by consumer demand for low-cost air travel. The group, along with associate companies EasyJet UK, EasyJet Europe and EasyJet Switzerland, operates 321 aircraft. It has 29 bases across Europe, the largest being Gatwick. In 2022, the airline carried more than 69.7 million passengers, making it the second largest budget airline in Europe by number of passengers carried, behind Ryanair.

EasyJet was featured in the television series &quot;Airline&quot;, broadcast on ITV (1998–2007), which followed the airline&#x27;s operations in London Luton and later at other bases. Its pilot training scheme was the subject of another ITV television series, &quot;&quot;, which premiered in August 2017.

==History==
===Origins and formation===
EasyJet has its roots in the business activity of Greek-Cypriot Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who reportedly gained an interest in the aviation business after being approached as a potential investor in Virgin Atlantic&#x27;s Greek franchisee. Recognising a vacant niche in the market, Stelios decided to examine the prospects for launching his airline, having secured a commitment of a £5 million loan from his father. While studying various business models in the industry, Stelios took a significant interest in the American operator Southwest Airlines, which had successfully adopted the practice of price elasticity to be competitive with traditionally cheaper buses and attract customers that would not normally have considered air travel. This principle became a cornerstone of EasyJet&#x27;s operations.

In 1995, EasyJet was established by Stelios, being the first company in what would later become the EasyGroup conglomerate. Upon launch, it employed just 70 people; the company is based at London Luton Airport, which was traditionally used only by charter flights. To encourage the company, Luton Airport chose to give EasyJet free use of a building for its headquarters, which it named &quot;EasyLand&quot;; its management style typified minimal overhead, such as an early implementation of the paperless office concept. EasyJet initially operated a pair of wet leased Boeing 737-200 aircraft, capable of seating 130 passengers. These were flown on two routes: Luton to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Early on, EasyJet operated as a &quot;paper airline&quot;, the aircraft themselves being flown and maintained under a lease.

Early promotional activity focused on the airline&#x27;s relatively low pricing compared to incumbent operators. Within its first year, EasyJet reportedly carried approximately 40,000 passengers.

In April 1996, the first wholly owned aircraft was delivered to EasyJet, enabling the company&#x27;s first international route, to Amsterdam, which was operated in direct competition with rival airlines British Airways (BA) and Dutch flag carrier KLM. Competitors responded to the emerging EasyJet in different ways; while BA was largely indifferent, KLM allegedly chose to respond with a predatory pricing strategy that led to an investigation by the European Union over unfair competitive practices. Despite commercial pressure from the emergent no-frills sector, traditional airlines have been unable to directly adopt similar practices to EasyJet due to vigorous protection of existing employee privileges by unions.

EasyJet&#x27;s aircraft were initially operated by GB Airways from November 1995 until July 1996 and subsequently by Air Foyle HeavyLift until October 1997, as EasyJet had not yet received its Air Operator&#x27;s Certificate.

===Flotation ===
On 5 November 2000, EasyJet was floated on the London Stock Exchange. In October 2004, the FL Group, owner of the airlines Icelandair and Sterling Airlines, purchased an 8.4% stake in the airline. Over the course of 2005, FL increased its share in the company periodically to 16.9%, fuelling speculation that it would mount a takeover bid for the UK carrier. However, in April 2006, the threat of takeover receded as FL sold its stake for €325 million, securing a profit of €140 million on its investment.

In March 2013, EasyJet was promoted to the FTSE 100; during the same month, the company launched its 100th route from Gatwick Airport, offering flights directly from London to Moscow. By 2015, the company was flying routes to more than 130 destinations in 31 countries, operated 26 bases centred around Europe, and had a total of 10,000 employees.

===Expansion and acquisitions===

In March 1998, EasyJet purchased a 40% stake in Swiss charter airline TEA Basle for three million Swiss francs. The airline was renamed EasyJet Switzerland and commenced franchise services on 1 April 1999, having relocated its headquarters to Geneva Airport. Geneva was EasyJet&#x27;s first new base outside the United Kingdom. In 2002, rival airline Go Fly was purchased for £374 million; the airline inherited three new bases from Go, at Bristol Airport, East Midlands Airport and London Stansted Airport; the acquisition of Go almost doubled the number of Boeing 737-300 aircraft in the EasyJet fleet.

In 2002, the airline opened its base at Gatwick Airport. Between 2003 and 2007, it opened additional bases in Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, establishing a presence in continental Europe. By 2007, EasyJet was claiming to be operating more flights per day than any other European airline.

On 25 October 2007, EasyJet purchased the entire share capital of GB Airways from the Bland Group. This acquisition was valued at £103.5 million, and was used by the airline to expand its operations at Gatwick, and to establish a base at Manchester Airport.

In June 2011, the airline opened its eleventh British base – at London Southend Airport, offering flights to Alicante, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Belfast, Faro, Málaga, Jersey, Palma de Mallorca and Ibiza.

In July 2017, EasyJet announced it would open a new European headquarters in Austria to enable it to operate after Brexit.

On 28 October 2017, EasyJet announced it would lease 25 former Air Berlin A320 aircraft to operate across EasyJet Europe&#x27;s network, under its European AOC. Several of these aircraft were based at Berlin-Tegel Airport, before its closure. These aircraft have subsequently been transferred to Berlin-Brandenburg Airport. Previously EasyJet had only operated from Berlin-Schönefeld Airport and Berlin-Tegel Airport, where EasyJet had taken over some of Air Berlin&#x27;s old services.

On 30 March 2020, EasyJet suspended all flights, grounded its entire fleet, and furloughed its crews due to travel restrictions imposed. This came after the company had flown 650 &quot;rescue flights&quot;, taking 45,000 people back home. In April 2020, EasyJet secured a £600 million loan from the UK Government. In June 2020, EasyJet announced their intention to resume flights, flying half of their routes in July 2020 and up to 75 per cent in August 2020, though with reduced frequency.

In April 2020, EasyJet became involved in a dispute with its owner and largest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou. Haji-Ioannou criticised the airline&#x27;s decision not to seek to cancel the outstanding Airbus order, claiming it would create an additional £4.5 billion of capital which the airline could not afford to spend. He threatened to call a general meeting to remove a director every three weeks unless subsequent action was taken. A general meeting was held on 22 May, where shareholders ultimately voted over 99% in favour of the EasyJet board and retaining the Airbus contract.

On 19 May 2020, the company revealed that it had been the subject of a cyber-attack resulting in the release of the personal information of 9 million customers.

On 10 September 2021, the company claimed it had rejected a takeover bid from rival Wizz Air.

On 30 September 2021, Stelios Haji-Ioannou and his family lost control of the company, after failing to take up the rights issue and being diluted: their stake was 15.27% as of 30 September 2021.

==Corporate affairs==

===Business strategy===
EasyJet, like Ryanair, uses a business model pioneered by Southwest Airlines. Both airlines have adapted this model for the European market through further cost-cutting measures, such as not selling connecting flights or providing complimentary snacks on board. The key points of this business model are high aircraft utilisation, quick turnaround times, charging for extras (such as priority boarding, holding baggage, and food) and keeping operating costs low.

Initially, EasyJet&#x27;s employment strategy was to maintain control with minimal union involvement. During the 2000s, the airline adopted a different approach, deciding to make accommodations for unions.

Originally, EasyJet did not allocate seats so passengers took any available seats, with the option to pay for &quot;Speedy Boarding&quot;, which allowed them to be first onto the aircraft. Since 2012, all passengers are allocated numbered seats before boarding commences, as it was found that this does not slow down boarding times and could earn more revenue than Speedy Boarding. Passengers can pay an additional fee for certain seats such as the front few rows and overwing seats (which have extra legroom).

===Business trends===

Between the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and August 2020, EasyJet raised over £2.4 billion in new finance. Out of the sum, £600 million came from the Covid Corporate Financing Facility provided by the UK government and over £400 million was raised from the placement of shares. In November 2020, EasyJet announced that, due to the pandemic and the lockdowns in many countries, it would scale back its reduced flying schedule to no more than 20 per cent of capacity. It also announced its first annual loss during the 25-year history of the company.

The key trends for the EasyJet Group are (as of the financial year ending 30 September):


===Head office===

EasyJet&#x27;s head office is Hangar 89 (H89), a building located on the grounds of London Luton Airport in Luton, Bedfordshire; the hangar is located from EasyLand, the previous headquarters of the airline. Hangar 89, built in 1974, has of office space and can house three aircraft the size of an Airbus A319 at one time. When EasyJet received H89, it had a 1970s-style office setup. The airline modernised the building and painted it orange.

===Marketing===
EasyJet&#x27;s early marketing slogan was &quot;making flying as affordable as a pair of jeans&quot;. It urged travellers to cut out the travel agent. Its original advertising consisted of little more than the airline&#x27;s telephone booking number painted in bright orange on the side of its aircraft. The specific colour that EasyJet uses closely resembles that of the telecommunications corporation Orange and was a subject of dispute between the two companies in 2004 when EasyGroup launched a mobile phone subsidiary, easyMobile.

The &quot;Airline&quot; TV series created by LWT and filmed between 1999 and 2007 made EasyJet a household name in the United Kingdom. The series, while not always portraying the airline in a positive light, did much to promote it during this time. The airline has used a number of slogans since its establishment, including &quot;The Web&#x27;s Favourite Airline&quot;, &quot;Come on, let&#x27;s fly&quot; and &quot;To Fly, To Save&quot; (a parody of British Airways&#x27; slogan &quot;To Fly, To Serve&quot;). This was then followed by &quot;[...] by easyJet&quot;, with &quot;Europe by easyJet&quot; and &quot;business by easyJet&quot; being the most widely used. It currently uses the slogan &quot;This is Generation easyJet&quot;.

===Environment===

In June 2007, EasyJet announced plans for the construction of its airliner, dubbed &quot;EcoJet&quot;. It was claimed to possess improved fuel efficiency over contemporary airliners. To achieve this, the EcoJet was described as using propfan engines, as well as being constructed with extensive use of carbon fibre composite material. At the time of the announcement, it was stated that the first flight was scheduled to occur sometime during 2015. Speaking at the time, EasyJet chief executive Andy Harrison commented that: &quot;We have not developed a new concept. We have taken ideas from Boeing, Airbus and the engine manufacturers and put them together.&quot; Harrison claimed that the EcoJet, combined with other improvements in the industry, would enable a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions within eight years. However, there have been few announcements on the project since then. EasyJet then campaigned for the UK to replace air passenger duty (APD) with a new tax that would vary depending on distance travelled and aircraft type.

In July 2008, the United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) criticised a press campaign by the airline, over a misleading environmental claim that its aircraft released 22% fewer emissions than rival airlines. The figures used were not based on emissions produced by an EasyJet aircraft or emissions produced by the airline overall as the advertisement implied, and ASA declared that the airline had broken advertising rules. The judgement that followed reprimanded the airline in April 2007 after it made comments that its aircraft created 30% less pollution per passenger than some of its rivals.

In February 2011, the airline painted eight of its aircraft with a lightweight, thin &quot;revolutionary nanotechnology coating&quot; polymer. It works by reducing the build-up of debris and reduces drag across the surface of the aircraft, thus reducing the fuel bill. It was estimated the airline could save 1–2% annually, equating to a £14 million reduction in fuel costs. The coating has already been used on US military aircraft and if successful EasyJet would apply the paint to its whole fleet. In late 2015, EasyJet started making use of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data for the purpose of improving efficiency, cutting costs, and enhancing the customer experience.

On 27 September 2017, EasyJet announced its partnership with an American start-up company Wright Electric with the purpose of developing and introducing a short-haul 120-seat all-electric airline. The propulsion system is said to comprise a series of eight electrically driven ducted fans that are buried in the wings, which are powered by numerous battery packs distributed underneath the cabin floor; it is claimed to possess a range of roughly 335 miles, suitable for about one-fifth of EasyJet&#x27;s current city routes, and facilitate zero-emission flights, as well as being 50% quieter and 10% less expensive to operate than conventional jet airliners. At the time, EasyJet stated that it intended to introduce electric aircraft into revenue service within 10 years. In October 2018, EasyJet stated that progress was being made on its electric ambitions and that the partnerships planned to test a nine-seater electric plane as early as 2019.

Since November 2019, EasyJet has offset the carbon emissions from all of its flights using carbon offsetting projects that meet either the Gold Standard or Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) accreditation. As a result, it is the first major airline in the world to operate net-carbon-zero flights across its entire network. The airline describes this as an &quot;interim&quot; measure whilst the next generation of aircraft propulsion is developed. Consequently, EasyJet announced a partnership with Airbus on a joint research project into zero-emission hydrogen aircraft.

===Customer issues===
EasyJet has been criticised in Germany for not observing European Union law on compensation (and assistance to passengers) in cases of denied boarding, delays or cancellations (Regulation 261/2004). When flights are cancelled, passengers are supposed to be reimbursed within one week. In 2006, the airline did not always refund tickets in a timely fashion. Passengers occasionally had to wait longer for reimbursement of their expenses.

In July 2011, the airline tried to refuse the carriage of a boy with muscular dystrophy because he had an electric wheelchair. In separate incidents in 2012, paralympians received similar treatment, and a French court found the airline guilty of three counts of disability discrimination. In January 2017, the company was fined €60,000 by another French court because it had refused to allow a disabled passenger to the board in 2010; the company cited security concerns and internal regulations but said it would not appeal against the ruling.

In September 2013, a passenger who sent a tweet complaining about the airline after his flight was delayed said he was initially told he would not be allowed to board the aircraft because of the posting.

On 27 August 2020, the airline was sued by a woman over discriminatory concerns. The woman had been asked to switch seats twice in a row, to accommodate two ultra-Orthodox Jewish men.

On 18 August 2023, a blind couple stated the airline &quot;refused&quot; to assist them with booking tickets after a missed previous flight, stating they must book online and &quot;told [them] they couldn&#x27;t help us&quot;. The airline offered an apology and Swissport and ABM who provided passenger assistance service on behalf of the airline that day said they are both &quot;looking into this&quot;.

=== European AOC ===
Following the UK&#x27;s referendum vote to leave the European Union, EasyJet announced a plan to establish an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) in another EU member state. This will secure the flying rights of the 30% of EasyJet&#x27;s network that remains wholly within and between EU states, excluding the UK. EasyJet expected a one-off cost of around £10 million over two years with up to £5 million incurred in the 2017 financial year. The primary driver of the cost is the re-registering of aircraft in an EU AOC jurisdiction. In July 2017, EasyJet announced that it has applied for, and was subsequently granted by the Ministry of Transport, an Austrian Air Operator Certificate (AOC) and operating permit, thereby establishing EasyJet Europe. The new airline is headquartered in Vienna and will allow EasyJet to continue operating flights across and within European countries after the UK leaves the EU. The first aircraft, an Airbus A320, was re-registered as OE-IVA.

EasyJet announced that the transition would result in no job losses in the UK, as the staff to be employed by EasyJet Europe are already based in the EU27. EasyJet UK staff would continue to be based in Luton. The group will thus comprise three airlines, EasyJet UK, EasyJet Europe, and EasyJet Switzerland, all of which are owned by EasyJet PLC, which is itself EU owned and controlled, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and based in the UK. In May 2018, EasyJet confirmed that it was very close to achieving the required majority EU27 share ownership and that the UK government will nevertheless continue to consider it as a UK airline.

In 2013, EasyJet entered a commercial agreement with Transaero to set up a codeshare agreement, whereby Transaero acquired the right to sell a certain number of seats on EasyJet&#x27;s Moscow (Domodedovo) – London (Gatwick) route. This was the first codeshare agreement for EasyJet; it was terminated when Transaero Airlines ceased to operate in October 2015. Citing diminishing demand on the route, EasyJet ceased all flights to Moscow in March 2016.

EasyJet has a reward miles sharing agreement with Emirates.

== Incidents ==

* On 15 September 2006, EasyJet Flight 6074, an Airbus A319-111, registered as G-EZAC, suffered a major electrical failure, rendering the radio, autopilot, TCAS, and electronic flight instrument system inoperable, among other critical systems. This nearly caused a mid-air collision with another aircraft, an American Airlines Boeing 777, which diverted from its collision course with fewer than 30 seconds to spare. The A319&#x27;s pilots continued their flight straight to Bristol out of fear of being shot down, since the failure knocked out their transponder. This made it impossible for the aircraft to be tracked by air traffic control, which potentially would have forced the assumption that it had been hijacked were it to deviate from its initially approved flight path without clearance.

==Fleet==


===Current group fleet===
EasyJet PLC&#x27;s total fleet comprises entirely of Airbus A320 family aircraft. , the group operates the following aircraft:

===Fleet strategy and aircraft orders===
In common with other low-cost carriers, EasyJet has a strategy of operating just one aircraft type. Initially, it used Boeing 737 aircraft exclusively, but in October 2002, it ordered 120 Airbus A319 aircraft, plus 120 options. Since then, all orders have been from the Airbus A320 family, and the Boeing aircraft have been phased out. With the acquisition of GB Airways in 2007, EasyJet inherited nine Airbus A320 and six Airbus A321 aircraft. This gave the airline some time to evaluate the feasibility of operating these larger aircraft. Based on this evaluation, EasyJet exchanged 25 A319 orders for A320s in July 2008 and later removed the A321 aircraft from the fleet.

On 18 June 2013, the airline announced an intention to acquire – subject to shareholder approval – 35 Airbus A320 aircraft, for delivery between 2015 and 2017, and 100 Airbus A320neo aircraft for delivery between 2017 and 2022. As part of the agreement, the airline will have purchase rights on a further 100 A320neo aircraft. The current generation A320s and fifty of the A320neos will replace the current A319 aircraft.

On 15 May 2017, EasyJet announced the conversion of 30 A320neo orders into A321neo aircraft to be used on busier routes. The then-CEO of EasyJet, Carolyn McCall, stated of the change: &quot;bigger planes would help easyJet increase capacity in slot-constrained airports at peak times, such as Geneva, Amsterdam and London Gatwick&quot;. She added that the A321neos would help to cut costs by 9 per cent. The company took delivery of the first A321neo on 18 July 2018 at the Farnborough International Airshow.

On 20 November 2018, EasyJet ordered an additional 17 A320neo, taking their total neo order, including the A321neo, to 147. On 19 November 2019, EasyJet ordered an additional 12 A320neo, taking the total neo orders, including the A321neo, to 159.

On 20 July 2022, during the Farnborough International Airshow, EasyJet confirmed the placing of an order for 56 A320neo, including an upsizing of 18 A320neo from their original order to the longer A321neo model. EasyJet was reported to have secured a significant reduction on the list price of the aircraft as part of their original 2013 deal with Airbus.

In December 2023, the airline ordered ‍56 A320neo and 101 A321neo aircraft.

===Booking===

Initially, booking was by telephone only; as a means of promoting this, all of the airline&#x27;s aircraft were painted with the booking telephone number. There is no incentive for travel agents to book flights on the airline because it does not pay commissions, which is an industry-standard practice for low-cost carriers.

In December 1997, one of EasyJet&#x27;s design and advertising agencies suggested to Stelios Haji-Ioannou that he should consider trialling a website for direct bookings. Haji-Ioannou&#x27;s reply was: &quot;The Internet is for nerds, it will never make money for my business!&quot; Other executives of the airline saw the potential and approved a website trial involving putting a different telephone reservation number on the website to track success. Once Haji-Ioannou saw the results, he changed his mind and an e-commerce website capable of offering real-time online booking went live in April 1998; this was the first such website for a low-cost carrier in Europe.

In December 2001, the airline switched from a third-party reservation system to an in-house system. Internet bookings were priced cheaper than booking by telephone to reflect the reduced call centre costs; as a further means of encouraging the use of the website, aircraft were repainted with the web address. Within a year, over 50% of bookings were made using the website; by April 2004, the figure had reportedly jumped to 98%.

In December 2011, EasyJet launched their mobile app on the App Store and Google Play Store allowing customers to book flights and store boarding passes. In 2019, the app accounted for 21.8% of bookings made with the airline.

===Cabin and onboard services===

The airline&#x27;s main fleet, comprising Airbus A319, A320, A320neo and A321neo aircraft, carry up to 156, 186, 188 and 235 passengers, respectively, depending on the layout. An Airbus A319 carries 150 to 156 passengers depending on the layout in a single-class configuration, but as the airline does not serve meals on its shorter flights, it opted for smaller galleys and had a lavatory installed in unused space at the rear of the aircraft. The space saved by having smaller galleys allowed for the installation of 156 seats. Due to this seating arrangement, to satisfy safety requirements, the airline&#x27;s Airbus A319 aircraft have two pairs of over-wing exits, instead of the standard one-pair configuration found on most Airbus A319 aircraft.

EasyJet does not provide complimentary meals or drinks on its flights (except for some occasional charter flights operated by the airline). Passengers may purchase items on board from the &quot;Eat Drink Shop&quot; buy on board programme. Onboard sales are an important part of the airline&#x27;s ancillary revenue; gifts such as fragrances, cosmetics, gadgets as well as duty-free cigarettes, rolling tobacco and a large selection of spirits. The airline&#x27;s monthly inflight magazine is called &quot;The Traveller&quot;.

The airline had previously provided in-flight entertainment (IFE) in some aircraft, such as the ex-GB Airways fleet, using drop-down screens on some Airbus aircraft; by 2018, all use of IFE had been discontinued. The airline offers headphones for purchase, along with a travel pillow and eyeshades, subject to stock. During 2017, &#x27;Air Time&#x27; was introduced on some EasyJet Switzerland flights, which enables passengers to connect to watch a selection of films and read books through an on-board WiFi network; this service is provided by Rakuten.

===Frequent flyer, business travel and loyalty products===
Three distinct loyalty products are offered, tailored towards business and frequent flyers. These are Flexi Fare, EasyJet Plus and a new frequent traveller loyalty programme called Flight Club. Flexi Fare is a type of ticket that is usually more expensive than the regular fare and comparable to a business ticket with other airlines. This ticket offers additional flexibility, including unlimited free date changes within a set period, free route changes, complimentary checked baggage (1x20 kg), an increased carry-on baggage allowance, and a £7.50 on-board refreshment voucher. EasyJet Plus is an annual subscription product targeted at frequent flyers, both business and leisure. This service offers free allocated seating (including extra legroom), priority check-in, fast-track security, speedy boarding and extra cabin baggage. The airline&#x27;s loyalty programme is called Flight Club.

===EasyJet Hotels and EasyJet Holidays===
On 14 December 2004, EasyJet and Hotelopia, a subsidiary of First Choice Holidays, launched the co-branded EasyJetHotels accommodation booking service. EasyJetHotels offers accommodation products throughout the airline&#x27;s network. Customers booking flights through the airline&#x27;s website are provided with quotes for several hotels at their destination. Alternatively, customers can book accommodation separately at the EasyJetHotels website.

On 28 June 2007, the airline expanded its relationship with Hotelopia by launching EasyJet Holidays, which offers Travel Trust Association protected package holidays made up of EasyJet flights and Hotelopia accommodation products.

On 6 November 2010, the airline started a venture with Low Cost Travel Group, to offer flights dynamically packaged with Low Cost Travel Group&#x27;s accommodation through the EasyJet Holidays website. As of March 2011, EasyJet Holidays has provided holidays and city breaks to all of the airline&#x27;s routes.

A mid November 2019 report indicated that the company planned to relaunch the package holiday business, after the bankruptcy of former competitor Thomas Cook.&quot;The total European package holidays market is worth around £61bn per year ... we know customers want holidays with various durations and not the traditional seven and 14 nights. The UK alone is a £13bn market and has grown by 6% annually,&quot; according to a company spokesperson.

<doc id="180472" wikidata="Q5164712" url="?curid=180472" title="Consumer privacy">
<text>Consumer privacy is information privacy as it relates to the consumers of products and services.

A variety of social, legal and political issues arise from the interaction of the public&#x27;s potential expectation of privacy and the collection and dissemination of data by businesses or merchants. Consumer privacy concerns date back to the first commercial couriers and bankers who enforced strong measures to protect customer privacy. In modern times, the ethical codes of various professions specify measures to protect customer privacy, including medical privacy and client confidentiality. State interests include matters of national security. Consumer concerned about the invasion of individual information, thus doubtful when thinking about using certain services. Many organizations have a competitive incentive to collect, retain, and use customer data for various purposes, and many companies adopt security engineering measures to control this data and manage customer expectations and legal requirements for consumer privacy.

Consumer privacy protection is the use of laws and regulations to protect individuals from privacy loss due to the failures and limitations of corporate customer privacy measures. Corporations may be inclined to share data for commercial advantage and fail to officially recognize it as sensitive to avoid legal liability in the chance that lapses of security may occur. Modern consumer privacy law originated from telecom regulation when it was recognized that a telephone company had access to unprecedented levels of information. Customer privacy measures were seen as deficient to deal with the many hazards of corporate data sharing, corporate mergers, employee turnover, and theft of data storage devices (e.g., hard drives) that could store a large amount of data in a portable location.

Businesses have consumer data and information obtained from consumer and client purchases, products, and services. Thus, businesses have the responsibility to keep these data and information safe and confidential. Consumers expect that businesses will take an active stance when protecting consumer privacy issues and supporting confidential agreements. Whether a firm provides services or products to consumers, firms are expected to use methods such as obfuscation or encoding methods to cover up consumer data when analyzing data or trends for example. Firms are also expected to protect consumer privacy both within the organizations themselves and from outside third entities including third party providers of services, suppliers who provide product components and supplies, and government institutions or community partnership organizations. In addition, businesses are sometime required to provide an agreement/contract to service clients or product consumer that states customer or client information and data will be kept confidential and that it will not be used for advertising or promotional purposes for example. The US government, including the FTC, have consumer protection laws like The Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Data Transparency and Privacy Act. Individuals States have laws and regulation that protect consumers as well. One example of this is The California Consumer Privacy Act.

== Legislation ==
Consumer privacy concerns date back to the first commercial couriers and bankers who enforced strong measures to protect customer privacy. Harsh punitive measures were passed as the result of failing to keep a customer&#x27;s information private. In modern times, the ethical codes of most professions specify privacy measures for the consumer of any service, including medical privacy, client confidentiality, and national security. These codes are particularly important in a carceral state, where no privacy in any form nor limits on state oversight or data use exists. &quot;Corporate customer privacy practices&quot; are approaches taken by commercial organizations to ensure that confidential customer data is not stolen or abused. Since most organizations have strong competitive incentives to retain exclusive access to customer data, and since customer trust is usually a high priority, most companies take some security engineering measures to protect customer privacy. There is also a concern that companies may sell consumer data if they have to declare bankruptcy, although it often violates their own privacy policies.

The measures companies take to protect consumer privacy vary in effectiveness, and would not typically meet the much higher standards of client confidentiality applied by ethical codes or legal codes in banking or law, nor patient privacy measures in medicine, nor rigorous national security measures in military and intelligence organizations. The California Consumer Privacy Act, for example, protects the use of consumer privacy data by firms and governments. This act makes it harder for firms to extract personal information from consumers and use it for commercial purposes. Some of the rights included in this act include:

* The right to know about the personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared
* The right to delete personal information collected from them (with some exceptions)
* The right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information
* The right to non-discrimination for exercising their CCPA rights

Since companies operate to generate a profit, commercial organizations also cannot spend unlimited funds on precautions while remaining competitive; a commercial context tends to limit privacy measures and to motivate organizations to share data when working in partnership. The damage done by privacy loss is not measurable, nor can it be undone, and commercial organizations have little or no interest in taking unprofitable measures to drastically increase the privacy of customers. Corporations may be inclined to share data for commercial advantage and fail to officially recognize it as sensitive to avoid legal liability in the chance that lapses of security may occur. This has led to many moral hazards and customer privacy violation incidents.

Some services—notably telecommunications, including Internet—require collecting a vast array of information about users&#x27; activities in the course of business, and may also require consultation of these data to prepare bills. In the US and Canada, telecom data must be kept for seven years to permit dispute and consultation about phone charges. These sensitivities have led telecom regulation to be a leader in consumer privacy regulation, enforcing a high level of confidentiality on the sensitive customer communication records. The focus of consumer rights activists on the telecoms industry has super-sided as other industries also gather sensitive consumer data. Such common commercial measures as software-based customer relationship management, rewards programs, and target marketing tend to drastically increase the amount of information gathered (and sometimes shared). These very drastically increase privacy risks and have accelerated the shift to regulation, rather than relying on the corporate desire to preserve goodwill.

Concerns have led to consumer privacy laws in most countries, especially in the European Union, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Notably, among developed countries, the United States has no such law and relies on corporate customer privacy disclosed in privacy policies to ensure consumer privacy in general. Modern privacy law and regulation may be compared to parts of the Hippocratic Oath, which includes a requirement for doctors to avoid mentioning the ills of patients to others—not only to protect them, but to protect their families— and also recognizes that innocent third parties can be harmed by the loss of control of sensitive personal information.

Modern consumer privacy law originated from telecom regulation when it was recognized that a telephone company—especially a monopoly (known in many nations as a PTT)—had access to unprecedented levels of information: the direct customer&#x27;s communication habits and correspondents and the data of those who shared the household. Telephone operators could frequently hear conversations—inadvertently or deliberately—and their job required them to dial the exact numbers. The data gathering required for the process of billing began to become a privacy risk as well. Accordingly, strong rules on operator behaviour, customer confidentiality, records keeping and destruction were enforced on telephone companies in every country. Typically only police and military authorities had legal powers to wiretap or see records. Even stricter requirements emerged for various banks&#x27; electronic records. In some countries, financial privacy is a major focus of the economy, with severe criminal penalties for violating it.

==History==
===1970s===
Through the 1970s, many other organizations in developed nations began to acquire sensitive data, but there were few or no regulations in place to prevent them from sharing or abusing the data. Customer trust and goodwill were generally thought to be sufficient in first-world countries, notably the United States, to ensure the protection of truly sensitive data; &quot;caveat emptor&quot; was applied in these situations. But in the 1980s, smaller organizations also began to get access to computer hardware and software, and these simply did not have the procedures or personnel or expertise, nor less the time, to take rigorous measures to protect their customers. Meanwhile, via target marketing and rewards programs, companies were acquiring ever more data.

Gradually, customer privacy measures were seen as deficient to deal with the many hazards of corporate data sharing, corporate mergers, employee turnover, and theft of data storage devices (e.g. hard drives) that could store a large amount of data in a portable location. Explicit regulation of consumer privacy gained further support, especially in the European Union, where each nation had laws that were incompatible (e.g., some restricted the data collection, the data compilation and the data dissemination); it was possible to violate privacy within the EU simply doing these things from different places in the European Common Market as it existed before 1992.

===1990s===
Through the 1990s, the proliferation of mobile telecom, the introduction of customer relationship management, and the use of the Internet in developed nations brought the situation to the forefront, and most countries had to implement strong consumer privacy laws, often over the objections of business. The European Union and New Zealand passed particularly strong laws that were used as a template for more limited laws in Australia and Canada and some states of the United States (where no federal law for consumer privacy exists, although there are requirements specific to banking and telecom privacy). In Austria around the 1990s, the mere mention of a client&#x27;s name in a semi-public social setting was enough to earn a junior bank executive a stiff jail sentence.

===2000s===
After the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, privacy took a back-seat to national security in legislators&#x27; minds. Accordingly, concerns of consumer privacy in the United States have tended to go unheard of as questions of citizen privacy versus the state, and the development of a police state or carceral state, have occupied advocates of strong privacy measures. Whereas it may have appeared prior to 2002 that commercial organizations and the consumer data they gathered were of primary concern, it has appeared since then in most developed nations to be much less of a concern than political privacy and medical privacy (e.g., as violated by biometrics). Indeed, people have recently been stopped at airports solely due to their political views, and there appears to be minimal public will to stop practices of this nature. The need for stricter laws is more pronounced after the American web service provider, Yahoo admitted that sensitive information (including email addresses and passwords) of half a billion users was stolen by hackers in 2014. The data breach was a massive setback for the company and raised several questions about the revelation of the news after two years of the hacking incident.

<text>In computing, a symbolic link (also symlink or soft link) is a file whose purpose is to point to a file or directory (called the &quot;target&quot;) by specifying a path thereto.

Symbolic links are supported by POSIX and by most Unix-like operating systems, such as FreeBSD, Linux, and macOS. Limited support also exists in Windows 7 and Windows Vista, and to some degree in Windows 2000 and Windows XP in the form of shortcut files. CTSS on IBM 7090 had files linked by name in 1963. By 1978 minicomputer operating systems from DEC, and in Data General&#x27;s RDOS included symbolic links.

==Overview==
A symbolic link contains a text string that is automatically interpreted and followed by the operating system as a path to another file or directory. This other file or directory is called the &quot;target&quot;. The symbolic link is a second file that exists independently of its target. If a symbolic link is deleted, its target remains unaffected. If a symbolic link points to a target, and sometime later that target is moved, renamed or deleted, the symbolic link is not automatically updated or deleted, but continues to exist and still points to the old target, now a non-existing location or file. Symbolic links pointing to moved or non-existing targets are sometimes called &quot;broken&quot;, &quot;orphaned&quot;, &quot;dead&quot;, or &quot;dangling&quot;.

Symbolic links are different from hard links. Hard links do not link paths on different volumes or file systems, whereas symbolic links may point to any file or directory irrespective of the volumes on which the link and target reside.
Hard links always refer to an existing file, whereas symbolic links may contain an arbitrary path that does not point to anything.

Symbolic links operate transparently for many operations: programs that read or write to files named by a symbolic link will behave as if operating directly on the target file. However, they have the effect of changing an otherwise hierarchic filesystem from a tree into a directed graph, which can have consequences for such simple operations as determining the current directory of a process. Even the Unix standard for navigating to a directory&#x27;s parent directory no longer works reliably in the face of symlinks. Some shells heuristically try to uphold the illusion of a tree-shaped hierarchy, but when they do, this causes them to produce different results from other programs that manipulate pathnames without such heuristic, relying on the operating system instead.
Programs that need to handle symbolic links specially (e.g., shells and backup utilities) thus need to identify and manipulate them directly.

Some Unix as well as Linux distributions use symbolic links extensively in an effort to reorder the file system hierarchy. This is accomplished with several mechanisms, such as variant, context-dependent symbolic links. This offers the opportunity to create a more intuitive or application-specific directory tree and to reorganize the system without having to redesign the core set of system functions and utilities.

==POSIX and Unix-like operating systems==
In POSIX-compliant operating systems, symbolic links are created with the codice_1 system call. The codice_2 shell command normally uses the codice_3 system call, which creates a hard link. When the codice_4 flag is specified, the symlink() system call is used instead, creating a symbolic link. Symlinks were introduced in 1982 in 4.1a BSD Unix from U.C. Berkeley.

The following command creates a symbolic link at the command-line interface (shell):

 is the relative or absolute path to which the symbolic link should point. Usually the target will exist, although symbolic links may be created to non-existent targets. is the path of the symbolic link.

After creating the symbolic link, some operations can be used to treat it as an alias for the target. However, the codice_5, codice_6 and codice_7 operations are unique to symbolic links and do not apply to the target; by using those system calls, programs that examine the file system (e.g., codice_8, codice_9) can report on symbolic links (instead of their targets, if any). Because the codice_10 and codice_11 system calls are coded to operate directly on symbolic links, file system management commands (e.g., codice_12, codice_13) affect the symbolic link itself (instead of being applied to the symbolic link target, if any). The codice_14 (delete file) command removes the link itself, not the target file. Likewise, the codice_15 command moves or renames the link, not the target. The codice_16 command has options that allow either the symbolic link or the target to be copied. Commands which read or write file contents will access the contents of the target file.

The POSIX directory listing application, codice_17, denotes symbolic links with an arrow after the name, pointing to the name of the target file (see following example), when the long directory list is requested (codice_18 option). When a directory listing of a symbolic link that points to a directory is requested, only the link itself will be displayed. In order to obtain a listing of the linked directory, the path must include a trailing directory separator character (&#x27;/&#x27;, slash).
Note: In the example below do not create &quot;three&quot; directory before creation of link in /tmp directory.

$ mkdir -p /tmp/one/two
$ echo &quot;test_a&quot; &gt;/tmp/one/two/a
$ echo &quot;test_b&quot; &gt;/tmp/one/two/b
$ cd /tmp/one/two
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 a
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 b

$ cd /tmp
$ ln -s /tmp/one/two three
$ ls -l three
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user group 12 Jul 22 10:02 /tmp/three -&gt; /tmp/one/two
$ ls -l three/
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 a
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 b

$ cd three
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 a
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 7 Jan 01 10:01 b
$ cat a
test_a
$ cat /tmp/one/two/a
test_a
$ echo &quot;test_c&quot; &gt;/tmp/one/two/a
$ cat /tmp/one/two/a
test_c
$ cat a
test_c
===Storage of symbolic links===
Early implementations of symbolic links stored the symbolic link information as data in regular files. The file contained the textual reference to the link&#x27;s target, and the file mode bits indicated that the type of the file is a symbolic link.

This method was slow and an inefficient use of disk-space on small systems. An improvement, called fast symlinks, allowed storage of the target path within the data structures used for storing file information on disk (inodes). This space normally stores a list of disk block addresses allocated to a file. Thus, symlinks with short target paths are accessed quickly. Systems with fast symlinks often fall back to using the original method if the target path exceeds the available inode space. The original style is retroactively termed a slow symlink. It is also used for disk compatibility with other or older versions of operating systems.

Although storing the link value inside the inode saves a disk block and a disk read, the operating system still needs to parse the path name in the link, which always requires reading additional inodes and generally requires reading other, and potentially many, directories, processing both the list of files and the inodes of each of them until it finds a match with the link&#x27;s path components. Only when a link points to a file in the same directory do &quot;fast symlinks&quot; provide significantly better performance than other symlinks.

The vast majority of POSIX-compliant implementations use fast symlinks. However, the POSIX standard does not require the entire set of file status information common to regular files to be implemented for symlinks. This allows implementations to use other solutions, such as storing symlink data in directory entries.

The file system permissions of a symbolic link are not used; the access modes of the target file are controlled by the target file&#x27;s own permissions. Some operating systems, such as FreeBSD, offer the ability to modify file permissions and filesystem attributes of a symbolic link, through codice_19 and codice_20 system calls respectively.

The reported size of a symlink is the number of characters in the path it points to.

===Error handling===
A traditional Unix filesystem has a tree structure, however symbolic links allow it to contain loops. 

==Microsoft Windows==

===NTFS symbolic link===

NTFS 3.1 introduced support for symbolic links for any type of file. It was included with Windows XP, but was only enabled by default for kernel-mode apps. Windows Vista and later versions of Windows enabled support for symbolic links to user-mode applications. The codice_21 internal command of Windows Command Prompt can create symbolic links. Third-party drivers are required to enable support for NTFS symbolic links in Windows XP. Unlike junction points, a symbolic link can also point to a file or remote Server Message Block (SMB) network path. Additionally, the NTFS symbolic link implementation provides full support for cross-filesystem links. However, the functionality enabling cross-host symbolic links requires that the remote system also support them.

Symbolic links are designed to aid in migration and application compatibility with POSIX operating systems. Microsoft aimed for Windows Vista&#x27;s symbolic links to &quot;function just like UNIX links&quot;. However, the implementation differs from Unix symbolic links in several ways. For example, Windows Vista users must manually indicate when creating a symbolic link whether it is a file or a directory. Windows 7 and Vista support a maximum of 31 reparse points (and therefore symbolic links) for a given path (i.e. any given path can have at most 31 indirections before Windows gives up). Only users with the new &quot;Create Symbolic Link&quot; privilege, which only administrators have by default, can create symbolic links. If this is not the desired behavior, it must be changed in the Local Security Policy management console. Additionally, NTFS symbolic links to files are distinct from NTFS symbolic links to directories and therefore cannot be used interchangeably, unlike on POSIX where the same symbolic link can refer to either files or directories.

In Windows Vista and later, when the working directory path ends with a symbolic link, the current parent path reference, , will refer to the parent directory of the symbolic link rather than that of its target. This behavior is also found at the shell level in at least some POSIX systems, including Linux, but never in accessing files and directories through operating system calls. For instance, bash builtin commands and operate on the current logical directory. is often used in scripts to determine the actual current working directory. When any path is used with a system call, any use of will use the actual filesystem parent of the directory containing the pseudo-directory entry. So, and may return completely different results.

==== Examples ====
The following examples both create a symbolic link called &quot;Downloads&quot; at &quot;E:\&quot; that points to the Downloads folder in the current user&#x27;s profile.

* The first example works in Windows Command Prompt only because codice_21 is an internal command.
mklink /D E:\Downloads %UserProfile%\Downloads
* The second example works in PowerShell only because New-Item is an internal cmdlet.
New-Item -Path &#x27;E:\Downloads&#x27; -ItemType &#x27;SymbolicLink&#x27; -Value &quot;$Env:UserProfile\Downloads&quot;
===NTFS junction points===

The Windows 2000 version of NTFS introduced reparse points, which enabled, among other things, the use of Volume Mount Points and junction points. Junction points are for directories only, and moreover, local directories only; junction points to remote shares are unsupported. The Windows 2000 and XP Resource Kits include a program called &quot;&quot; to create junction points; a more powerful one named &quot;Junction&quot; was distributed by Sysinternals&#x27; Mark Russinovich.

Not all standard applications support reparse points. Most noticeably, Backup suffers from this problem and will issue an error message 0x80070003 when the folders to be backed up contain a reparse point.

===Shortcuts===
Shortcuts, which are supported by the graphical file browsers of some operating systems, may resemble symbolic links but differ in a number of important ways. One difference is what type of software is able to follow them:
* Symbolic links are automatically resolved by the file system. Any software program, upon accessing a symbolic link, will see the target instead, whether the program is aware of symbolic links or not.
* Shortcuts are treated like ordinary files by the file system and by software programs that are not aware of them. Only software programs that understand shortcuts (such as the Windows shell and file browsers) treat them as references to other files.

The mechanisms also have different capabilities:
* Microsoft Windows shortcuts normally refer to a destination by an absolute path (starting from the root directory), whereas POSIX symbolic links can refer to destinations via either an absolute or a relative path. The latter is useful if both the symlink and its target share some common ancestor path which is not known at creation (e.g., in an archive file that can be unpacked anywhere).
* Microsoft Windows application shortcuts contain additional metadata that can be associated with the destination, whereas POSIX symbolic links are just strings that will be interpreted as absolute or relative pathnames.
* Unlike symbolic links, Windows shortcuts maintain their references to their targets even when the target is moved or renamed. Windows domain clients may subscribe to a Windows service called Distributed Link Tracking to track the changes in files and folders to which they are interested. The service maintains the integrity of shortcuts, even when files and folders are moved across the network. Additionally, in Windows 9x and later, Windows shell tries to find the target of a broken shortcut before proposing to delete it.

====Folder shortcuts====
Almost like shortcuts, but transparent to the Windows shell. They are implemented as ordinary folders (which need to have the &quot;read only&quot; and/or &quot;system&quot; attribute) containing a shortcut named &quot;target.lnk&quot; which refers to the target and a (hidden) &quot;desktop.ini&quot; with (at least) the following contents:

 [.ShellClassInfo]
 CLSID2={0AFACED1-E828-11D1-9187-B532F1E9575D}

Folder shortcuts are created and used from the Windows shell in the &quot;network neighborhood&quot; for example.

===Shell objects===
The &quot;shell objects&quot; or &quot;shell folders&quot; are defined in the Windows registry and can be used to implement a sort of symbolic link too. Like folder shortcuts, they are transparent to the Windows shell.

A minimal implementation is (the CLSID &quot;{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}&quot; is used as a placeholder):
 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}]
 @=&quot;display name&quot;
 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\DefaultIcon]
 @=&quot;...&quot; ; path to icon
 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\InProcServer32]
 @=&quot;%SystemRoot%\\System32\\ShDocVw.Dll&quot;
 &quot;ThreadingModel&quot;=&quot;Apartment&quot;
 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\Instance]
 &quot;CLSID&quot;=&quot;{0AFACED1-E828-11D1-9187-B532F1E9575D}&quot;
 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\Instance\InitPropertyBag]
 &quot;Attributes&quot;=hex:15,00,00,00
 &quot;Target&quot;=&quot;...&quot; ; absolute (WITHOUT &quot;TargetKnownFolder&quot; or &quot;TargetSpecialFolder&quot; only)
 ; or relative path to target
 &quot;TargetKnownFolder&quot;=&quot;{guidguid-guid-guid-guid-guidguidguid}&quot; ; GUID of target folder, Windows Vista and later
 &quot;TargetSpecialFolder&quot;=&quot;0x00xy&quot; ; CSIDL of target
 [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}\ShellFolder]
 &quot;Attributes&quot;=hex:00,00,00,00

The &quot;My Documents&quot; folder on the &quot;Desktop&quot; as well as the &quot;Fonts&quot; and the &quot;Administrative Tools&quot; folders in the &quot;Control Panel&quot; are examples of &quot;shell objects&quot; redirected to file-system folders.

===Cygwin symbolic links===
Cygwin simulates POSIX-compliant symbolic links in the Microsoft Windows file system. It uses identical programming and user utility interfaces as Unix (see above), but creates Windows shortcuts (.lnk files) with additional information used by Cygwin at the time of symlink resolution. Cygwin symlinks are compliant with the POSIX standard in terms of how they are resolved, and with Windows standards in terms of their on-disk representation.

Additionally, Cygwin can be set up to support native Windows symbolic links which can be used out of Cygwin without restrictions. This requires:
# Changing the CYGWIN environment variable to contain ;
# Running the Cygwin with elevated rights because Windows restricts the creation of symbolic links to privileged users

Some differences exist, however. Cygwin has no way to specify shortcut-related information – such as working directory or icon – as there is no place for such parameters in codice_23 command. To create standard Microsoft .lnk files Cygwin provides the codice_24 and codice_25 utilities.

The Cygwin User&#x27;s Guide has more information on this topic. MSYS2, which is based on Cygwin, has a similar set of settings but defaults to copying the files.

==Comparison of POSIX and Windows symbolic links==

==Other implementations==
Implementations of features similar to symbolic links.

===Early MIT===

MIT Compatible Time-Sharing System and Incompatible Timesharing System both have linked files where the name of the target file is specified in a directory entry.

===Amiga===
The command creating symbolic links is codice_26, which is also used for hard links. Internally the dos.library returns an error code indicating that a target is a soft link if you try to perform actions on it that are only legal for a file, and applications that wish to follow the symbolic link then needs to explicitly make a call to follow the link and retry the operation. The AmigaDOS shell will follow links automatically.

===Mac OS===

In Mac OS, applications or users can also employ &quot;aliases&quot;, which have the added feature of following the target, even if it is moved to another location on the same volume. This is not to be confused with the shell command alias.

===OS/2===
In the OS/2 operating system, symbolic links somewhat resemble shadows in the graphical Workplace Shell. However, shadows, due to the fully object-oriented System Object Model, are considerably more powerful and robust than a simple link. For example, shadows do not lose their capabilities when renamed or when either the object or subject of the link is relocated.

==Variable symbolic links==
Symbolic links may be implemented in a context-dependent or variable fashion, such that the link points to varying targets depending on a configuration parameter, run-time parameter, or other instantaneous condition.

A &quot;variable&quot; or &quot;variant symbolic link&quot; is a symbolic link that has a variable name embedded in it. This allows some flexibility in filesystem order that is not possible with a standard symbolic link. Variables embedded in a symbolic link may include user and environment specific information.

Operating systems that make use of variant symbolic links include NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, Domain/OS.
Tru64 uses a &quot;context dependent symbolic link&quot; where the context is the cluster member number.

Pyramid Technology&#x27;s OSx operating system implemented &quot;conditional symbolic links&quot; which pointed to different locations depending on which universe a program was running in. The universes supported were AT&amp;Ts&#x27;s SysV.3 and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD 4.3). For example: if the ps command was run in the &quot;att&quot; universe, then the symbolic link for the directory &quot;/bin&quot; would point to &quot;/.attbin&quot; and the program &quot;/.attbin/ps&quot; would be executed. Whereas if the ps command was run in the &quot;ucb&quot; universe, then &quot;/bin&quot; would point to &quot;/.ucbbin&quot; and &quot;/.ucbbin/ps&quot; would be executed. Similar Conditional Symbolic Links were also created for other directories such as &quot;/lib&quot;, &quot;/usr/lib&quot;, &quot;/usr/include&quot;.

<text>Terry and the Pirates is an action-adventure comic strip created by cartoonist Milton Caniff, which originally ran from October 22, 1934, to February 25, 1973. Captain Joseph Patterson, editor for the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate, had admired Caniff&#x27;s work on the children&#x27;s adventure strip &quot;Dickie Dare&quot; and hired him to create the new adventure strip, providing Caniff with the title and locale. The Dragon Lady leads the evil pirates; conflict with the pirates was diminished in priority when World War II started.

The strip was read by 31 million newspaper subscribers between 1934 and 1946. In 1946, Caniff won the first Cartoonist of the Year Award from the National Cartoonists Society for his work on &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;.

Writer Tom De Haven described &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; as &quot;&quot;the&quot; great strip of World War II&quot; and &quot;The &quot;Casablanca&quot; of comics&quot;.

== Publication history ==
The daily strip began October 22, 1934, and the Sunday color pages began December 9, 1934. Initially, the storylines of the daily strips and Sunday pages were different, but on August 26, 1936, they merged into a single storyline.

Although &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; had made Caniff famous, the strip was owned by the syndicate, which was not uncommon at the time. Seeking creative control of his own work, Caniff left the strip in 1946, his last &quot;Terry&quot; strip being published on December 29. The following year, with the Field Syndicate, he launched &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;, an action-adventure strip of which Caniff retained ownership, which ran until shortly after his death in 1988.

After Caniff&#x27;s departure, &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; was assigned to Associated Press artist George Wunder. Wunder drew highly detailed panels, but some critics, notably Maurice Horn, claimed that it was sometimes difficult to tell one character from another and that his work lacked Caniff&#x27;s essential humor. Nevertheless, Wunder kept the strip going for another 27 years until its discontinuation on February 25, 1973, by which time Terry had reached the rank of colonel.

===Reboot===
On March 26, 1995, Michael Uslan and the Brothers Hildebrandt produced an updated version of the strip which carried over no continuity with the original. The Dragon Lady is portrayed as a Vietnam War orphan. The Hildebrandt/Uslan team left the strip and was replaced on April 1, 1996, with the team of Dan Spiegle (art) and Jim Clark (writing). The strip ended on July 27, 1997.

==Characters and story==
The adventure begins with young Terry Lee, &quot;a wide-awake American boy,&quot; arriving in then-contemporary China with his friend, two-fisted journalist Pat Ryan. Seeking a lost gold mine, they meet George Webster &quot;Connie&quot; Confucius, interpreter and local guide. Initially, crudely drawn backgrounds and stereotypical characters surrounded Terry as he matched wits with pirates and various other villains. He developed an ever-larger circle of friends and enemies, including Big Stoop, Captain Judas, Cheery Blaze, Chopstick Joe, Cue Ball, and Dude Hennick.

Most notable of all was the famed &quot;femme fatale&quot;, the Dragon Lady, who started as an enemy and later, during World War II, became an ally. Caniff included a number of non-American female antagonists, all of whom referred to themselves in the third person. These included the Dragon Lady and crooks and spies like Sanjak and Rouge. In a rather bold move for a 1940s comic strip, Sanjak was hinted at being a lesbian cross-dresser with designs on Terry&#x27;s girlfriend April Kane. Caniff purportedly named the character after an island next to the isle of Lesbos.

Over time, owing to a successful collaboration with cartoonist Noel Sickles, Caniff dramatically improved to produce some of the most memorable strips in the history of the medium. , Caniff&#x27;s assistant on &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;, went on to create his own adventure strip, &quot;Bruce Gentry&quot;.

===Main===

* Terry Lee: A teenager when the series begins, he is excitable and loves adventure. As the series goes on, he matures and joins the U.S. Army, becoming a pilot. After World War II, he works for the government in the post-war territories. In his last comic strip Feb 25, 1973, Colonel Lee is a USAF officer who helps break up a heroin smuggling ring which results in the arrest of its head, the President of a foreign country.
* Pat Ryan: Terry&#x27;s friend and mentor, a writer and man of action who helps his young protégé out of scrapes. When World War II begins, he joins the U.S. Navy and sees action in the Pacific.
* Connie: George Webster Confucius, a Chinese man Terry and Pat hire as a guide. He speaks in Pidgin English and refers to himself in the third person. He is fiercely loyal to the duo. He eventually works with Pat as part of the Chinese resistance against the Japanese in the war.
* Big Stoop: A Mongol whom Connie helped when he was being picked on by bullies. He remains with the trio out of gratitude. Immensely strong and mute, he earns his nickname from the phrase &quot;he stoops to conquer&quot;. He was once a servant of the Dragon Lady; she cut out his tongue when he was young, earning his hatred. He works with Connie in the Chinese resistance during the war.
* The Dragon Lady: A beautiful but cold pirate queen who clashes with Terry and Pat continuously. As the Japanese invade China, she becomes a resistance leader, attacking Japanese forces, making it clear it is not out of patriotism but wanting to keep her riches intact. It is hinted she is in love with Pat, but she is unwilling to give up her empire for him. After the war ends, she returns to criminal activities.
* Burma: Real name unknown, a con artist, former pirate confederate and sultry singer with a good heart. She encounters Terry and Pat several times. She and Terry share a casual romantic connection, but Burma is afraid of letting it become serious. She has a habit of singing &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;.
* Normandie Drake: An heiress and Pat&#x27;s true love, they grew close when he worked for her father. Her high society aunt refused to see her marry a &quot;commoner&quot; and forced her into an arranged marriage to the weak-willed Tony Sandhurst. When She and Pat meet again, she is pregnant with Tony&#x27;s child and is committed to the marriage. When they meet again during the War, Normandie&#x27;s child Merilly is four years old. When she discovers that Tony is working with the Axis Powers, Normandie still refuses to divorce him.
* Raven Sherman: An heiress who used her fortune to support missionary work in China. She and Pat seem romantic, but she falls for pilot Dude Hennick. She dies in Hennick&#x27;s arms after being attacked by Captain Judas and is buried in the China desert. Following her death in October 1941, Milton Caniff received annual reminders of her passing.
* April Kane: A Southern belle who wins Terry&#x27;s heart. She works as Pat&#x27;s secretary when he is an agent of the Dragon Lady, but she leaves when she becomes the target of a blackmailer. She returns in 1944, having spent the last few years in a Japanese prison camp. The experience has hardened her, and she tries to make Terry jealous by cavorting with Flip Corkin. She tries to set up an airfield near an island army base but she learns too late that the Army is abandoning the island, and she is stranded there alone.
* Flip Corkin: Terry&#x27;s flight instructor in the Air Force, who delivers the Sunday page lecture on military duty. Based on Phil Cochran.
* Taffy Tucker: Flip&#x27;s girlfriend, an Army nurse. She briefly develops amnesia and is rescued by Pat, and they connect romantically. She returns to Flip after regaining her memory.
* Hotshot Charlie: Charles C. Charles, a comically flippant Boston pilot who becomes Terry&#x27;s best friend in the Air Force. After the war ends, he is stifled by civilian life and jumps at the chance to help Terry out in post-war Asia doing government work.

===Recurring===

* Captain Blaze: A boisterous English pirate who helps Terry and Pat out against the Dragon Lady, later returning to help Pat out in China.
* Captain Judas: A debonair criminal who clashes with the heroes several times. A former partner of Burma&#x27;s, he sustains severe facial burns when she throws a lamp in his face. He shoved Raven out of a truck, leading to her fatal injuries before being shot by Dude Hennick and presumably killed.
* Papa Pyzon: A corpulent criminal Terry and Pat meet in China who later returns as an Axis agent during the war.
* Nasty: Nastalathia Smythe-Heatherstone, a young heiress Terry and Burma rescue from a crashed plane. Her bratty and selfish attitude drives them crazy and nearly gets them killed. Years later, the now-grown Nasty returns to involve Terry and Charlie in her efforts to ship food to Chinese refugees, which is really an attempt to win Terry. She tries to woo Charlie to get at Terry.
* Tony Sandhurst: Normandie&#x27;s rich but immoral husband, who puts himself above everyone. He tries to have Pat put in jail for ruining his business and is later revealed to be working for the Axis during the war and becomes a criminal kingpin in the post-war period.
* Hu Shee: The Dragon Lady&#x27;s aide and confidante who sometimes impersonates her for some missions. She seems interested in a romance with Terry. She is apparently drowned under a sinking ship with new love, pirate Johnny Jingo.
* Cheery Blaze: Captain Blaze&#x27;s hefty daughter who hates her father with a passion. She returns during the war working with the Axis but is arrested for her crimes.
* Singh-Singh: A dim-witted would-be warlord who clashes with Pat and the Dragon Lady. He later marries Cheery Blaze but is arrested with her.
* Chopstick Joe: An underworld figure who is a friendly rival of the Dragon Lady.
* Dude Hennick: An old friend of Pat&#x27;s, an ace pilot who helps the heroes out. He goes to work for Raven Sherman, the two falling in love but she ends up dying in his arms. He vanishes from the strip and a Christmas, 1945 strip has Caniff saying he based the character on a pilot friend, Frank Cliff, who was killed in Shanghai and &quot;Dude died with him.&quot;
* Sanjak: A Frenchwoman who dresses like a man, using a monocle to hypnotize people. She works for the Axis, impersonating a pilot to infiltrate Terry&#x27;s Air Force base and is apparently killed in a crashing plane.
* Jos Goode: A Southern soldier who serves with Pat, Connie, and Big Stoop in the Pacific.
* Snake Tumblin: A fellow pilot of Terry&#x27;s, he is apparently killed in a crashing plane. However, Caniff&#x27;s final strips show him seemingly alive but blinded.
* Jane Allen: An Army nurse who falls in love with Snake. She and Terry seem to be getting closer but when she sees a picture of Snake alive, she leaves Terry on the tarmac in Caniff&#x27;s final strip.

==During World War II==
Caniff became increasingly concerned by the contemporary Second Sino-Japanese War, but he was prevented by his syndicate from identifying the Japanese directly. Caniff referred to them as &quot;the invaders&quot;, and they soon became an integral part of the storyline.

After America&#x27;s entry into World War II, Terry joined the United States Army Air Forces. The series then became almost exclusively about World War II with much action centering on a U.S. Army base in China. This change of tone is considered the end of the strip&#x27;s prime, although it remained highly acclaimed. Terry gained a new mentor in flying instructor Colonel &quot;Flip&quot; Corkin, a character based on the real-life Colonel Philip &quot;Flip&quot; Cochran of the 1st Air Commando Group. Comic relief was provided by fellow flyer Hotshot Charlie. Pat, Connie and Big Stoop still made occasional guest appearances as marine commandos, while the Dragon Lady and her pirates became Chinese guerrillas fighting the Japanese.

One of the highlights of this period was the October 17, 1943, Sunday page, &quot;The Pilot&#x27;s Creed&quot;: Corkin gives the recently commissioned Terry a speech on his responsibilities as a fighter pilot, including the need to consider all who have contributed to the development of his plane, respect his support crew, spare a thought for ones killed in the fighting, and respect military bureaucracy which, for better or worse, has kept the American army going for over 150 years. In an unusual honor, the episode was read aloud in the U.S. Congress and added to the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; by Congressman Carl Hinshaw.

The intensely patriotic Caniff, who donated design and illustration work to the military, created a free variant of &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; for the military newspaper &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;. Originally starring the beautiful adventuress Burma, it was racier than the regular strip, and complaints caused Caniff to rename it &quot;Male Call&quot; to avoid confusion. &quot;Male Call&quot; was discontinued in 1946.

==Awards==
In 1946, Caniff won the first Cartoonist of the Year Award from the National Cartoonists Society for his work on &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;.

==Reprints==
NBM, under its Flying Buttress Comics Library line, reprinted all of the Caniff &quot;Terry&quot; strips (10/22/34 to 12/29/46) in two hardcover series as well as in a series of trade paperbacks. The first 12-volume series contained all of the dailies and the Sundays in black and white. The second 12-volume series contained all of the Sundays in color with each page split between two pages. The daily strips were also printed by NBM in a 25-volume softcover edition (reprinting all of the dailies and the Sundays that ran concurrent storylines) with the strips in a smaller size and a lower quality than the hardcover volumes.

Kitchen Sink Press began a new hardcover reprint series with dailies and Sundays (in color and presented complete on one page, including title bars in the strips from the first year that were omitted from the NBM series), but discontinued it after only two volumes. These out-of-print series can be hard to find.

In March 2007, IDW Publishing announced a new imprint, The Library of American Comics. It published &quot;The Complete Terry and the Pirates&quot; a collection of six hardcover editions reprinting the Sunday strips with their original color alongside the daily strips.

As of 2015 Hermes Press has reprinted two volumes of the George Wunder comic strip (1946–1949) as 12&quot; x 9&quot; hardcovers with supplementary material and historic essays.

==In popular culture==
In 1953, Canada Dry offered a &quot;premium giveaway&quot; with a case of its ginger ale — one mini-book in a trilogy series of &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; strips by Wunder printed by Harvey Comics. 

Other incarnations of Caniff&#x27;s work included a 1940 movie adventure-serial by Columbia, a television series, and radio show. The August–September 1953 issue (#6) of &quot;Mad&quot; featured a satire by Wally Wood titled &quot;Teddy and the Pirates&quot; where Teddy and Half-Shot Charlie encounter the Dragging Lady, resulting in Half-Shot being thrown to the sharks while Teddy reveals the reason for the strip&#x27;s name — the pirates work for Teddy.

In the Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;China Jones&quot;, Daffy Duck plays a private detective, and goes to a Chinese bakery to receive a &quot;hot tip&quot;. The informant sends him to visit the &quot;Dragon Lady&quot;, who, upon meeting Daffy, breathes fire on him. Later, the informant asks him, &quot;How was that tip?&quot;, and Daffy answers, &quot;A little too hot for my taste.&quot;

&quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; has been cited by fellow comic illustrator Doug Wildey as one of his main inspirations for the 1964 Hanna Barbera television cartoon &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;. Joseph Barbera directly credited &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; during Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Oral History of Television&quot; interview as his inspiration for &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;.

Robert Culp said that the comic strip &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; was his inspiration for the &quot;tone&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;noir heightened realism&quot; of the 1965 NBC television series &quot;I Spy&quot; when he was writing the pilot. It had been Culp&#x27;s ambition to write, produce, and direct a screenplay based on the comic strip, but Culp died in 2010, before he could finish it.

&quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; producer Paul Heller used the strip as a guide to production design and the look of the film. &quot;It was high chroma reds, blues, golds, and it just lent itself to this project so closely,&quot; said Heller.

Artist John Romita Sr. got the idea to kill Peter Parker (Spiderman)&#x27;s girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, after &quot;Terry and the Pirates″&quot; killing of Raven Sherman.

Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana&quot; references &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;.

In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the &quot;Comic Strip Classics&quot; series of commemorative postage stamps.

In the 1983 movie, &#x27;A Christmas Story&#x27;, a Terry and the Pirates comic strip appears on back of the newspaper Ralphie&#x27;s father (Darren McGavin) is reading when Ralphie&#x27;s mom takes him upstairs after the BB gun incident.

<doc id="180475" wikidata="Q2612445" url="?curid=180475" title="The Late Late Show (Irish talk show)">
<text>The Late Late Show, with its title often shortened to The Late Late, is an Irish chat show. It is the world&#x27;s second longest-running late-night talk show, after the American &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and is the longest-running live talk show. Perceived as the official flagship television programme of RTÉ, it is regarded as an Irish television institution, and is broadcast live across normally two hours in front of a studio audience on Friday nights at 9:30 pm between September and May. Certain segments are sometimes pre-recorded and aired within the live parts of the show.

Having maintained the same name and format continuously, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was first broadcast on Friday 6 July 1962 at 11:20 pm and in colour from 1976. Originating as temporary summer filler for a niche Saturday night audience (airing at 11:30 pm), it later moved to its current home on Friday night schedules. The format has remained largely the same throughout, featuring interviews, musical performances and discourse on topical issues. It has influenced attitudes of the populace towards approval or disapproval of its chosen topics, directed social change and helped shape Irish societal norms. It averages 650,000 viewers per episode and has consistently achieved RTÉ&#x27;s highest ratings.

For much of its early life, RTÉ Television Centre&#x27;s Studio 1 at Montrose in Donnybrook, Dublin 4, was its home; this original studio accommodated a small audience of about 120. In 1995, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; transferred to the more spacious Studio 4, adapted specifically to cater for this and &quot;Kenny Live&quot;. Three external broadcasts have aired, including from the Wexford Opera House on 5 September 2008 and, most recently, from London in 2018.

Gay Byrne hosted the show from its inception until 21 May 1999. Pat Kenny was Byrne&#x27;s successor, hosting the show for ten years between 1999 and 2009. Ryan Tubridy succeeded Kenny in September 2009 and hosted the show for fourteen years. Under Tubridy, first Quinn Group and then Sky Broadband added sponsorship deals. Tubridy&#x27;s arrival coincided with a marked increase in audience ratings, with some early statistics comparing him to the Byrne era. Patrick Kielty is the current presenter, having succeeded Tubridy in September 2023.

==1962–1999: Gay Byrne==

The idea for the show was developed by RTÉ producer Tom McGrath, after he had seen &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; while working for a Canadian TV station. He proposed it to Gay Byrne, who became the show&#x27;s first presenter. The first episode aired on Friday 6 July 1962 at 23:20. Byrne was then a young Irish broadcaster working with Granada Television in Britain; while there he had become the first person to introduce The Beatles on television on &quot;People and Places&quot;.

Originally intended as light summer &quot;filler&quot;, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; soon developed into a forum for contentious opinion and debate, involving topics such as divorce, contraception and a number of areas hitherto unspoken. Much of the populace, especially in the south and west of Ireland, had no previous experience of television, and many were unprepared for &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; bringing such discussion into their homes (large swathes of Ireland were rural and devoutly Roman Catholic). Indeed, the politician Oliver J. Flanagan, whilst guesting on the show, proclaimed there to have been &quot;no sex in Ireland until Teilifís Éireann went on the air&quot;, reflecting this greater indiscretion. Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid, was confronted by a guest in the show&#x27;s first series — a sensational and unprecedented event. Many more such events would follow, each contributing to the folklore and mythical qualities of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;.

Two common formats were used: the first — a series of interviews of celebrity guests, most of whom could be defined as Irish or British and involved in the entertainment industry; the second — a defined topic involving live discussion from a panel and studio audience. The latter tended to be far the weightier in content, as people who were directly connected with the defined topic sat in the audience.

Byrne would remain host for 37 years, retiring in 1999. He came out of retirement to present such programmes as &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;; as of September 2009, Byrne&#x27;s 37 years remains the longest period through which any individual has hosted a televised talk show. In the late 1960s, with the launch of BBC2, Byrne moved back to the United Kingdom, where his career had started. Frank Hall presented &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; in Byrne&#x27;s absence. However, after one year, Byrne returned to RTÉ to present his old show, supplemented by his own radio show.

Few of the 1960s editions of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; are extant, as it was prohibitively expensive to use tape to record at this time.

=== Bishop and the Nightie ===
A minor furore erupted in 1966 when the Bishop of Clonfert condemned &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; as &quot;immoral&quot; and Gay Byrne as a promoter of &quot;filth&quot;. The condemnation stemmed from a small item on the show in which Byrne was interviewing a number of couples to see how well they knew each other. Byrne asked the Fox couple from Terenure what colour nightdress Mrs Fox wore during her honeymoon. Mr Fox implied it was &quot;transparent&quot; and Mrs Fox said she had not worn any nightdress. This response was received with laughter by Byrne and the studio audience, with Mrs. Fox then suggesting that her nightdress had been white from the options offered. However, the Bishop either misheard or ignored this, feeling the need to protest against this &quot;filthy&quot; programme and the &quot;filth&quot; which was being televised into the nation&#x27;s homes.

The Bishop of Clonfert sent a telegram: &quot;Disgusted with disgraceful performance&quot;, prompting a swift RTÉ apology which the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; states was similar to the apology the same broadcaster issued during the Brian Cowen nude portraits controversy in 2009. Meath VEC said it was &quot;anti-national&quot;, whilst Loughrea Town Council described it as &quot;a dirty programme that should be abolished altogether&quot;. The furore died down after a number of weeks, but is still remembered. When the topic featured on the 2008 documentary &quot;How the Irish Have Sex&quot; broadcast by rival channel TV3, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;″s Damian Corless said Éamon de Valera &quot;won&#x27;t be turning on, but will instead be turning in his grave&quot;.

=== Brian Trevaskis affair ===
On a March 1966 episode of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; a debate was held on the Roman Catholic Church. Brian Trevaskis, a young student and President of The Phil Society of Trinity College, making his first television appearance, criticised the Bishop of Galway, Michael Browne, for spending so much on a cathedral instead of helping the poor. Trevaskis described the building as a &quot;monstrosity&quot; and referred to the bishop as a &quot;moron&quot;. He was invited back on the show the following week, 6 April, to expand on his opinions. The student referred to the fiftieth anniversary of the Easter Rising, a pivotal moment in Irish history, when he expressed his concern over the devotion of money to building churches in a society where women who were impregnated outside marriage were considered outcasts and as such were vulnerable members of society. Trevaskis claimed Ireland was not a Christian country and when asked by the bishop if he knew the meaning of the word &quot;moron&quot;, he replied that he was uncertain the bishop knew the meaning of the word &quot;Christian&quot;.

=== Annie Murphy interview ===
In 1992, Bishop Eamonn Casey resigned when it was revealed that he had broken his vow of celibacy having fathered a child with a young American divorcee named Annie Murphy in 1973 during his tenure as Bishop of Kerry. Casey was a well-known bishop with a national profile, and had been a guest on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on several occasions. In April 1993, Murphy appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; to speak about the affair and their child, Peter. Casey had supported their son financially, but had requested that this be kept quiet to protect his career. At the end of the interview Byrne said if the baby was &quot;half the man his father was&quot; he would be fine and Annie Murphy replied that the boy&#x27;s mother (meaning herself) was &quot;not so bad either&quot;, drawing applause from the studio audience. Casey spent most of his time following the scandal outside Ireland in an effort to avoid media attention, but eventually returned in 2006. More than twenty years later, the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; named this one of its &quot;Top 10 moments of Irish television&quot;.

=== Tom Gilmartin affair ===
In 1999, Pádraig Flynn, Ireland&#x27;s EU Commissioner, appeared on the show, during which he commented on Tom Gilmartin and a donation of £50,000 to the Fianna Fáil party. Flynn also talked about &quot;the difficulties&quot; in his own life; he talked of having a salary of £100,000 (Irish Punt) and trying to run three houses, cars and housekeepers along with regular travel. The performance was seen as very out of touch, at a time when house prices in Ireland were rising dramatically, and the average industrial wage was £15,380.

Flynn also made remarks concerning Gilmartin, a Luton-based Irish developer and investor. In response to Byrne&#x27;s question that Flynn knew Gilmartin, Flynn answered, &quot;Oh yes, yes. I haven&#x27;t seen him now for some years. I met him. He&#x27;s a Sligo man who went to England, made a lot of money, came back, wanted to do a lot of business in Ireland, didn&#x27;t work out for him, didn&#x27;t work out for him. He&#x27;s not well. His wife isn&#x27;t well. He&#x27;s out of sorts.&quot; Flynn seemed to attack the credibility of Gilmartin at a time when he was making allegations in the media of planning irregularities in Dublin.

Gilmartin responded by publicising details of Flynn&#x27;s failed attempts to get Gilmartin to change his evidence. This led to Flynn&#x27;s career being effectively ended because the government would not endorse him for reappointment to the European Commission after its mass resignation that year. This &quot;vanity platform&quot; on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; saw, as the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; later referred to it, Flynn &quot;managed to get both feet into his mouth and talk at the same time&quot;.

=== Other incidents ===
;&quot;Playboy&quot;: In January 1966, Victor Lownes, a representative of &quot;Playboy&quot;, was expected to appear on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;; however, he was axed when he revealed that he hoped to recruit young women to work as Bunnies in Playboy clubs.
;Women&#x27;s rights: Elderly feminist campaigner Hilary Boyle criticised the Irish government when she appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; during the 1970s, calling them &quot;all so afraid of a belt of the crozier (the Bishop&#x27;s stick)&quot;.
;Contraceptive train: When several women, amongst them June Levine and Nell McCafferty, carried bags of condoms from Belfast on a train in protest at Ireland&#x27;s strict anti-contraception laws in 1971, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; became involved in the incident when one of the women, Mary Kenny, appeared in the studio to say that the law was &quot;pretty damn weird&quot;.
;Lesbian nuns: In 1979, Gay Byrne interviewed a lesbian on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, escaping public condemnation in the process. However, when two former nuns who were lesbians, Rosemary Curb and Nancy Manahan, were booked to appear in 1985, a High Court case ensued and calls came for &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; to be axed altogether as it would &quot;greatly undermine Christian moral values&quot; and &quot;the respect of the general public for nuns&quot; to feature the pair on live television. Protestors gathered to recite decades of the rosary, sing hymns as the show got underway. According to the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot;, &quot;the interview with the nuns ended up being not all that scandalous&quot;. During the discussion, Sr. Maura, an Irish nun from the Daughters of Sion, remarked that members of the clergy don&#x27;t &#x27;leave their sexuality at the door&#x27; when they enter religious life.
;AIDS special: An AIDS special in the 1980s included a controversial demonstration on live television of how to attach a condom to a finger.
;Brian Lenihan: Gay Byrne was a personal friend of Brian Lenihan and presented a tribute show in March 1990 to support the case for Lenihan as a candidate for the office of President of Ireland in the 1990 presidential election.
;Minding the children: In 1992 several female TDs who had been newly elected to Dáil Éireann appeared on the programme, with Gay Byrne wondering who was taking care of their children.
;Peter Brooke: In 1992 the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Brooke appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. After a pleasant interview, Byrne coaxed and goaded the unwilling Brooke into singing &quot;Oh My Darling, Clementine&quot; on a day when seven Protestant construction workers had been killed by an IRA bomb. Unionists were outraged at what seemed to be a moment clearly out of touch with grieving families, and instantly requested the resignation of Brooke. Brooke was humiliated, and subsequently lost his position as Secretary of State to Sir Patrick Mayhew after the 1992 British General Election in April.
;Gerry Adams: As a response to a change in legislation against terrorist groups being given publicity, known as Section 31, it became possible for RTÉ to interview Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams in 1994. Byrne set up a show, with a panel of public figures, Jim Kemmy, Dermot Ahern, Michael McDowell, Hugh Leonard and Austin Currie. The last three openly loathed Adams. Byrne himself refused to shake hands with Adams and kept a distance of over three metres away from him for most of the show. During the show, a number of people telephoned in stating that Byrne and the other panellists were acting in a &quot;hostile and aggressive&quot; manner towards Adams. Byrne maintained that nobody was specially invited to the audience. The interview did not seem to damage Adams&#x27;s popularity, with the &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; reporting that 70 per cent of people held a favourable view of him after the show.
;Terry Keane: &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; continued to cause controversy right up to Byrne&#x27;s departure. On his penultimate show in 1999, he interviewed the gossip columnist Terry Keane, who went on to reveal a long affair with the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. Haughey, a lifelong acquaintance of Byrne, had intended to be available for the last show but went into hiding from the media as a result of the revelations. Haughey had appealed to Keane not to reveal her story. Keane was publicising her book covering her life in Irish public life, and her career as a journalist with the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; newspaper group.
;Bill Murray: One show featured an interview with &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; actor Bill Murray. In the audience, comedian Jason Byrne masqueraded as a man who had set up a paranormal investigation agency, similar to that in the film. Murray responded by making a joke regarding his experience in a local restaurant.

=== Byrne&#x27;s role as producer ===
The flexibility of the show was augmented by Byrne&#x27;s position not merely as the show&#x27;s presenter but also as its producer for much of his period with the show. He intentionally reminded the viewer that the show was being broadcast live through his interaction with people working behind the scenes. Cameras were visible, and if an audience member was invited to speak, the boom microphone could be seen swinging overhead. Some of Byrne&#x27;s phrases became well known; when instructing that a piece of videotape be played, he invariably announced &quot;you can roll it there, Colette/Roisín&quot;, chat to the floor manager, inquiring as to what telephone line a caller was ringing in on, and on some shows would extend its running time by fifteen or thirty minutes, discussing the extra running time with the floor staff and production team as an &quot;aside&quot; during an interview. The effect of all these mannerisms was said to add to the sense of realism in the show, that, as the theme music at the end of the show stated: &quot;It started on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;.&quot; This was a clip of the Nat King Cole song &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, which appeared on his 1959 album &quot;Big Band Cole&quot;.

=== Byrne&#x27;s final show ===
On 21 May 1999, Byrne presented his last edition of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. The show, beginning at 21:30, lasted four hours (twice as long as a normal edition of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; at the time). Tributes flooded in from all quarters for the host. High-profile guests on this final show included author Salman Rushdie and comedian Billy Connolly.

The then Irish President Mary McAleese told Byrne: 
There were also glowing tributes for Byrne from then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, RTÉ broadcasters Des Cahill, Larry Gogan, Mike Murphy, Marian Finucane, American counterpart Merv Griffin, former Taoiseach Charles Haughey and various other celebrities.

There were musical performances on the night from The Corrs, Christy Moore, Sarah Brightman and Rosaleen Linehan. U2 members Bono and Larry Mullen presented Byrne with a Harley-Davidson motorcycle as a retirement present. Byrne was spotted on the bike regularly, until January 2003 when Byrne and U2 jointly auctioned the bike for The Children&#x27;s Medical &amp; Research Foundation at Our Lady&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin.

== 1999–2009: Pat Kenny ==
:&quot;Including Gerry Ryan for one night&quot;.
When Byrne left, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; dominated RTÉ&#x27;s ratings viewership figures, coming in consistently either at number 1 or number 2. Some columnists writing in the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; and &quot;The Irish Times&quot; called for the show be dropped as its success was linked too intricately with Byrne to work with anyone else. RTÉ, however, retained the show, justifying the decision as it being a powerful brand that attracted extensive advertising revenue. Contemporary media reports speculated that Patrick Kielty, Marian Finucane, Gerry Ryan and Gerry Kelly would take over. However, RTÉ gave the show to Pat Kenny, who for nearly a decade had presented his own &quot;Kenny Live&quot; show in the Saturday night time slot. Even after seven years at the helm of that show Kenny was often criticised in the media for his presentation style.

Kenny and his staff changed many aspects of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. Its distinctive title music was changed, as was the set design and studio layout. Guests, instead of remaining on, were involved only in that part of the show when the focus was them. A new set abandoned the traditional presenter&#x27;s desk. Unlike Byrne, Kenny ensured his guests were announced in advance. Other than the title, the use of an owl as the show&#x27;s symbol and the traditional edition marketing toys to children and their parents, little of the original remained the same. Byrne&#x27;s two catchphrases, &quot;It started on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;&quot;, and &quot;one for everyone in the audience&quot; were dropped. The latter of these phrases has since been revived under Kenny&#x27;s successor but was not much in use when Kenny was at the helm.

=== &quot;That rude interruption&quot; ===

As the 24 November 2006 edition of the show was getting underway, an intruder, Paul Stokes from Monkstown, County Dublin, emerged from off screen to confront a visibly startled Pat Kenny, who was had just greeted three guests, &quot;You&#x27;re a Star&quot; judges Thomas Black, Linda Martin, and Brendan O&#x27;Connor. Stokes approached Kenny, with his back to the camera, crouched down closer to Kenny and accused Kenny of being a &quot;censor&quot; and described him and his predecessor, Gay Byrne, as &quot;insufferable arseholes&quot;. The incident was broadcast live and uncensored before the studio audience. Kenny repeatedly uttered &quot;thank you, thank you&quot;. The show cut to a premature commercial break while Stokes was removed from the studio. When the show returned to television screens, Kenny apologised to viewers for what he described as &quot;that rude interruption&quot; and began his interview. Stokes was arrested but later released.

Today FM presenter Jenny Kelly reportedly went into labour whilst laughing as the incident unfolded on her television screen. She described her initial intention as having been to sit down for an evening of Kenny and to &quot;bore the baby into arriving&quot;.

It was later revealed that the intruder&#x27;s daughter was a member of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; crew. Shortly after the initial incident, the man rammed his vehicle into the front entrance of RTÉ&#x27;s Donnybrook facility; no-one was injured. He was also reported to have stood outside Kenny&#x27;s house shouting insults and to have painted threatening messages on walls near the house, although a charge of harassment connected with the case was dropped. The man was later sentenced to two years in prison for ramming the RTÉ entrance.

=== Other incidents ===
;O&#x27;Reilly/Callaly interview: In late October 2004, three weeks after Rachel O&#x27;Reilly was found murdered at her home in the Naul, north County Dublin, the mother and husband of the woman, Rose Callaly and Joe O&#x27;Reilly, were Kenny&#x27;s guests. Callaly&#x27;s trauma was evident; O&#x27;Reilly calmly dealt with Kenny&#x27;s questions. O&#x27;Reilly was later arrested. Two years later, he was convicted of the crime.

;Brendan Gleeson: On 17 March 2006 (Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, the national holiday), actor Brendan Gleeson became emotional while disclosing his views on the state of the national health service.

;Enrique Iglesias: In 2007, an interview with Spanish singer Enrique Iglesias proved awkward for Kenny. When Kenny persisted in asking about his relationship with the tennis player Anna Kournikova, Iglesias responded: &quot;You ask the questions so dry and so seriously that it kind of scares me.&quot;

;&quot;Jerry Sein&quot;field&quot;&quot;: In 2007, Kenny famously introduced the U.S. comedian Jerry Seinfeld as &quot;Jerry Seinfield&quot;. Much uncomfortable chat on the topic of bees (Seinfeld being on the show to promote &quot;Bee Movie&quot;) ensued before Kenny presented Seinfeld with a cheap imitation of his favourite superhero, Superman.

;Ticket tearing: In November 2008, Kenny telephoned a competition winner for a prize of a weekend in Dublin, shopping money and two tickets to the &quot;Late Late Toy Show&quot; episode. The winner, a woman from Cork city, answered the phone and correctly answered the competition question (&quot;Roald Dahl&quot;). The woman&#x27;s apparent lack of enthusiasm prompted Kenny to turn to Charlie Bird (who had been his previous guest) and say: &quot;If they tortured her, they couldn&#x27;t get anything out of this woman.&quot; Bird laughed. When asked who would be accompanying her using the other ticket, the woman said she was &quot;not particularly interested&quot; in the tickets and tried explaining her idea that they instead be raffled so that a worthier winner might be found. Kenny, the phone receiver perched between his ear and shoulder, pulled the offending sheets of paper from his breast pocket, tore them and said: &quot;I think I&#x27;ll give up this job&quot;.

;Pete Doherty: In February 2009, an interview with the English rock musician proved awkward for Kenny with the presenter repeatedly asking about the singer&#x27;s private life and showing no interest in his music.

;Senate first: In March 2009, a debate was held pitting twenty senators against journalists John Drennan and Ian O&#x27;Doherty on a proposal to abolish Seanad Éireann. Executive producer Larry Masterson described it as a &quot;first ever for TV&quot;.

=== Set design under Kenny ===

RTÉ launched the last revamp while Kenny was the host on Friday 7 September 2007, introducing a new set but retaining the title sequence in use since 2003. Designed by Darragh Treacy of RTÉ Production Design, that set consisted of metal, timber and polycarbonate, with carpet as a floor covering; it made for a more complex and layered background than the previous arrangement and was heavily dependent on saturated lighting and modern construction materials. According to Treacy: &quot;I wanted something contemporary that would be architectural and structural, [for example] the horizontal lines and boxes that you see running throughout the set. [...] The back wall of the [chat area] has textured panels which just take the light beautifully and give a great three-dimensional effect. Then the polycarbonate boxes sit in front of that. The fins – the large timber sections – to the left of the chat area are replicated in the entertainment area as well, and are large pieces of timber with a paint finish that take the light.&quot;

A desk also reappeared, as initially continued after Byrne&#x27;s departure but disposed of shortly afterwards despite a final-attempt redesign in 2000. Kenny noted: &quot;After eight seasons of sitting around, lounging around, as if in a living room, we decided just for a change that we&#x27;d put the desk in and see what difference it made. We&#x27;ll work with it: I mean if it doesn&#x27;t work after five or six weeks, it goes – if it does work, well we&#x27;ll find ways of using it effectively. I mean it does put a little barrier between myself and the guest, but on the other hand it can be very useful for a formal interview where you don&#x27;t want to be too intimate with your guest if it&#x27;s a little bit antagonistic, whereas in the past I was always reclining and even if I had to be a bit aggressive with a guest the body language was a little bit confusing in that regard. So we&#x27;ll see.&quot; In an apparent effort to resolve such problems, the new desk had more of a table design with a transparent underside, was angled to be narrower at the guest end, and was composed of thin elegant profiles of timber and glass.

A new entrance flight of steps was also introduced, somewhat redolent of former &quot;Kenny Live&quot; sets. Treacy again: &quot;I wanted a grand entrance, but I also wanted an entrance that was part of the background of the set, so they arrive down and join Pat – and it&#x27;s a feature walk-on for guests&quot;. Kenny approved of the steps: &quot;As you come down the steps, be it myself or a guest, you&#x27;re slowly revealed: more and more of your body is revealed to the audience until finally you&#x27;re standing in the &#x27;doorway&#x27; as it were. I think it&#x27;ll be interesting; a more dramatic entrance than we&#x27;ve had for the past three or four years.&quot; Irish company Design Classics Direct provided new chairs, made to an original 1929 design by Eileen Gray.

=== Kenny&#x27;s final show ===
On 27 March 2009, Kenny announced live on air without warning his intention to stand down.

On 29 May 2009, an average share of 55 per cent of the total TV audience tuned in to watch Kenny present his last edition of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; as regular host (he returned for one night in 2013 when his successor was unavailable). An outdoor event was set up for the occasion on the RTÉ campus. At the end of the show, Joe Duffy presented Kenny with a cake in the shape of a &quot;10&quot;, to mark his ten years of presenting. The Edge of U2 also gave Kenny glasses and a guitar.

==2009–2023: Ryan Tubridy ==

:&quot;Including Pat Kenny for one night and Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan for two nights.&quot;
After two months of speculation, Ryan Tubridy emerged as Kenny&#x27;s successor. Original host Gay Byrne gave Tubridy his blessing: &quot;He has all the qualities required, the light deft touch together with a serious mind. I think it&#x27;s a great adventure that he&#x27;s setting off on&quot;. Other personalities tipped for the role had included Gerry Ryan and Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan. O&#x27;Callaghan, whom some media commentators considered favourite for the job, claimed she had turned down an offer, so as to keep her &quot;Prime Time&quot; slot and spend time with her eight children.

Tubridy presented his first programme on 4 September 2009 with a custom picked staff, a new set and house band. He emerged from behind a red curtain and walked to a wooden desk, at which he sat in the same €3,000-plus Irish designed chair as the actress Meryl Streep in the film &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. Guests on this first show included Brian Cowen, Saoirse Ronan, Brian McFadden, Joan Collins, Cherie Blair, and Niall Quinn. With an overall audience share of 62 per cent, it was the most watched — outside the annual &quot;Late Late Toy Show&quot; — since Gay Byrne&#x27;s retirement in May 1999. This promising start would not last, however; audience ratings had declined by Tubridy&#x27;s sixth season. Another notable occurrence in Tubridy&#x27;s first season was when the show aired on Good Friday for the first time in 15 years in 2010. Later the same month (April), the show&#x27;s former hosts, Gay Byrne and Pat Kenny, alongside fellow RTÉ broadcasters Joe Duffy, Dave Fanning and Brenda Donohue, joined Tubridy to discuss the sudden death of one-time host and colleague Gerry Ryan on 30 April 2010.

Tubridy&#x27;s second season as host began with a notable interview with former British prime minister Tony Blair. The live interview occurred the night before a book signing at Eason&#x27;s which attracted international attention when Blair was pelted with shoes and eggs and successfully evaded an attempted citizen&#x27;s arrest on charges of war crimes.

On 1 February 2013, Pat Kenny returned to host that night&#x27;s edition when Tubridy&#x27;s father died.

In 2015, Tubridy&#x27;s tone and choice of questions when interviewing Anti-Austerity Alliance TD Paul Murphy in relation to the campaign against the implementation of a water tax was much criticised. Opponents of the water tax praised Murphy on social media for what was said to have been his &quot;restraint&quot; during the interview. Julien Mercille, the academic and writer of &quot;The Political Economy and Media Coverage of the European Economic Crisis: The Case of Ireland&quot;, observed that &quot;Tubridy was pretty good from the standpoint of protecting government interests. [...] He asked all the right questions to try to discredit the water charges protests and Paul Murphy&quot;.

In 2011, Tubridy announced that he hoped his time as host would be closer to Kenny&#x27;s ten years than Byrne&#x27;s 37, stating that Kenny made the &quot;right tenure&quot; as host. He hosted 14 seasons in total.

In March 2020, Tubridy and his production team were forced to produce the show without their usual live studio audience of around 200 who would come each week to watch the show air live from RTÉ&#x27;s Studio 4. The COVID-19 pandemic caused all large gatherings of people to be banned, and so RTÉ and the &quot;Late Late Show&quot; production team decided the talk show would continue to air live every Friday night for the remainder of the season, except there would be no studio audience. The show continued to air live during the pandemic, with special guests either being interviewed via the internet or guests come into the studio and were interviewed by Tubridy whilst maintaining social distance. The first edition of the show without an audience aired on 13 March 2020, and lasted until May 2021. Studio audiences returned on 3 September 2021, initially sitting spaced out at tables in order to maintain social distancing. In May 2022, the mask mandate for audience members was lifted.

On 16 March 2023, Tubridy announced that he would be stepping down as the presenter of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; after 14 years.

=== Tubridy&#x27;s final show ===
On 26 May 2023, Tubridy presented his last edition of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. Messages of congratulations poured in from Saoirse Ronan, Jessie Buckley, Paul McCartney, Russell Crowe and various other celebrities. High-profile guests on this final show included Irish President Michael D. Higgins, comedian PJ Gallagher, Jedward and Charlie Bird.

There were musical performances on the night from Andrea Corr, John Sheahan, Moya Brennan, Steve Wickham, Sharon Shannon and Cian Ducrot. U2 member Bono presented Tubridy with a red Vespa scooter.

==2023–present: Patrick Kielty==
In May 2023, after much speculation, Patrick Kielty was confirmed as Tubridy&#x27;s replacement, becoming the show&#x27;s fourth permanent presenter.

On 17 August 2023, it was announced that the running time for each episode of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; would be reduced from approximately two hours to 90 minutes, although each episode would still be split into four parts, with three commercial breaks. &quot;The Toy Show&quot;, however, retained the two-hour slot. The number of episodes per season was also reduced from approximately 36 to 30.

Kielty&#x27;s first show as host aired on Friday 15 September 2023.

==Hosts==

&quot;The Late Late Show&quot; has had four regular hosts: Gay Byrne, Pat Kenny, Ryan Tubridy and Patrick Kielty. Frank Hall deputised for Byrne for one season in the 1960s.

There have been other rare occasions on which another presenter has hosted the show. In 1972, Byrne became unexpectedly and seriously ill. Frequent panellist Ted Bonner presented in his absence. After 500 episodes of the programme in 1979, &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; host Eamonn Andrews appeared to Byrne&#x27;s surprise (he had been expecting American star Dana Andrews). Andrews took over and quizzed Byrne on his seventeen years with the programme. On another occasion, radio broadcaster and former newsreader Andy O&#x27;Mahony replaced Byrne for an interview with journalist Deirdre Purcell, who had ghostwritten Byrne&#x27;s autobiography.

After Kenny&#x27;s mother suddenly died in October 2008, Gerry Ryan was announced as guest presenter for that week&#x27;s show with less than 48 hours&#x27; notice. Kenny announced his decision to quit live on air in March 2009. On 11 May that year, RTÉ announced Ryan Tubridy as Kenny&#x27;s successor. Kenny in turn replaced Tubridy on 1 February 2013 for one night only, due to the death of Tubridy&#x27;s father.

A woman has only presented the &quot;Late Late Show&quot; on three occasions. On 15 November 1980, towards the end of one show about feminism, Gay Byrne ushered a young Marian Finucane into his seat to present part of an episode. In March and April 2020, Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan stood in for Ryan Tubridy on two consecutive weeks when Tubridy was quarantined with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 and later tested COVID-19 positive.

==Tribute shows==
==Toy Show==
Since the early 1970s, an annual Christmas edition entitled &quot;The Late Late Toy Show&quot; has been held in late November or early December, where various children&#x27;s toys are showcased to the audience before the Christmas season.

==Music==

===Theme music and opening titles===
Although not the original theme, the theme music most associated with the show is the instrumental introduction from Chris Andrews&#x27; 1965 single &quot;To Whom It Concerns&quot;, which was in use as early as 1971 and used until Byrne&#x27;s final show. The version used on the show was proceeded with a distinctive drum roll, followed by a whistle which would then segue into &quot;To Whom It Concerns&quot;. This was always accompanied by the spoken introduction: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, to whom it concerns, it&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, and here is your host, Gay Byrne&quot;. During the same era, a clip from &#x27;&quot;The Late Late Show&quot; by Nat King Cole was used as the closing music. &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was unusual during Byrne&#x27;s era in that the show&#x27;s production credits ran over the opening title sequence, and only a brief still of the show&#x27;s logo was shown at the end.

During the Kenny era, &quot;To Whom It Concerns&quot; was replaced, although the new theme incorporated elements of the distinctive drum roll from the old theme. Three different arrangements were used during this era. The show&#x27;s production credits were moved to the end at this point, and the closing theme has been the same as the opening since 1999.

A new set and title sequence was introduced for Ryan Tubridy&#x27;s first show, with Chris Andrews&#x27; &quot;To Whom It Concerns&quot; returning as the theme music after a ten-year absence, albeit in a new arrangement performed by &quot;The Late Late Show Band&quot; and RTÉ Concert Orchestra.

===First musical performances===
Below is a list of artists whose first televised performance happened on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;.
===Other notable musical performances===
Virgin Prunes, &quot;Theme for Thought&quot;, 1979.

Therapy?, invited to perform in 1994, were anticipated to perform their cover version of the Joy Division composition &quot;Isolation&quot;; disheartened with their treatment, however, they decided to perform their own composition &quot;Knives&quot; instead, without prior notice. The performance featured two instances of the expletive &quot;fuck&quot;, a word normally expected to be omitted. The nation was affronted. Therapy? returned the following year to perform another of their compositions, this one titled &quot;Stories&quot;.

In 1995, the English independent rock band Pop Will Eat Itself defaced the studio whilst in the midst of a performance. The group were invited back to Ireland by Byrne having performed in the country again.

Tammy Wynette and Ray Lynam duet on 22 March 1991 of &quot;Til a Tear Becomes a Rose&quot;.

==Eurovision Song Contest==

The Irish representative for the Eurovision Song Contest has been chosen annually through a variety of shows including a national song competition called &quot;Eurosong&quot; and a reality TV series called &quot;You&#x27;re a Star&quot;. The six finalists perform their songs live on the show, with voting done as a 50–50 split between regional juries and a public televote. The show also includes celebrity interviews, guest performances, and a panel of Eurovision experts who discuss the performances with the host.

Pat Kenny hosted numerous editions of the &quot;Eurosong&quot; final (which often replaced his Saturday Night chat show &quot;Kenny Live&quot;) and in 1988 he co-hosted the Eurovision Song Contest. In 2006 and 2007, the song was chosen on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, the performers Brian Kennedy and Dervish had already been chosen to represent the country at the contest. In 2008, RTÉ returned to the national song contest format for &quot;Eurosong&quot;. 2009 would be the last edition of the format that Pat Kenny would host and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; would host the competition until 2015. &quot;Eurosong&quot; returned in 2022, hosted by Ryan Tubridy, with 2023 being Tubridy&#x27;s last &quot;Eurosong&quot;. The format continued into its third consecutive year in 2024, hosted by Patrick Kielty.

==Accolades==
&quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was named &quot;Favourite Irish TV Show&quot; at the TV Now Awards on 22 May 2010.

<text>Terry and the Pirates is a radio serial adapted from the comic strip of the same name created in 1934 by Milton Caniff. With storylines of action, high adventure and foreign intrigue, the popular radio series enthralled listeners from 1937 through 1948. With scripts by Albert Barker, George Lowther and others, the program&#x27;s directors included Cyril Armbrister, Wylie Adams, and Marty Andrews.

The central character, Terry Lee, was portrayed at various times by Jackie Kelk, Cliff Carpenter, Owen Jordan, and Bill Fein. Some newspapers say that Jackie Kelk was the first actor to play Terry, when the series debuted on NBC in late October 1937. Terry&#x27;s buddy Pat Ryan was played by Bud Collyer, Warner Anderson, Bob Griffin, and Larry Alexander. Others in Terry&#x27;s Far East entourage were Flip Corkin (Ted de Corsia), Elita (Gerta Rozan), Burma (Frances Chaney), Hotshot Charlie (Cameron Andrews) and Connie the coolie (Cliff Norton, John Gibson, Peter Donald). Throughout the Orient, they encountered plenty of evildoers, including the Dragon Lady (Agnes Moorehead, Adelaide Klein, Marion Sweet, Mina Reaume), in such adventurous episodes as &quot;Pirate Gold Detector Ring,&quot; &quot;Deadly Current,&quot; &quot;The Mechanical Eye&quot; and &quot;The Dragon Lady Strikes Back.&quot;

==History==
When the late afternoon series began, it was heard at 5:15pm, three times a week, sponsored by Dari-Rich, airing on NBC Red Network from November 1, 1937 to June 1, 1938. It switched to NBC Blue Network on September 26, 1938, continuing until March 22, 1939. Absent from the airwaves for over two years, it returned shortly before the Attack on Pearl Harbor, heard in the Midwestern United States on the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s WGN. That series, sponsored by Libby&#x27;s, aired five days a week from October 16, 1941 to May 29, 1942.

With increasing popularity during the World War II years, the show next took off at a fast pace on Blue Network, airing daily for 15 minutes on weekday afternoons beginning February 1, 1943. The Quaker Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice &quot;shot from guns&quot; commercials often had a patriotic pitch. Douglas Browning was the announcer during the mid-1940s. After 1945, with no wartime villains for Terry and his pals to fight, ratings began to drop in the post-World War II period until the final episode on June 30, 1948.

<doc id="180481" wikidata="Q6942216" url="?curid=180481" title="Music of New Zealand">
<text>The music of New Zealand has been influenced by a number of traditions, including Māori music, the music introduced by European settlers during the nineteenth century, and a variety of styles imported during the twentieth century, including blues, jazz, country, rock and roll, reggae, and hip hop, with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand interpretation. 

Pre-colonial Māori music consisted mainly of a form of microtonal chanting and performances on instruments called taonga pūoro: a variety of blown, struck and twirled instruments made out of hollowed-out wood, stone, whale ivory, albatross bone, and human bone. In the nineteenth century, European settlers - the vast majority of whom were from Britain and Ireland - brought musical forms to New Zealand including brass bands and choral music, and musicians began touring New Zealand in the 1860s. Pipe bands became widespread during the early 20th century.

In recent decades, a number of popular artists have gone on to achieve international success including Lorde, Split Enz, Crowded House, Rosé, OMC, Bic Runga, Benee, Kimbra, Ladyhawke, The Naked and Famous, Fat Freddy&#x27;s Drop, Savage, Gin Wigmore, Keith Urban, Flight of the Conchords, Brooke Fraser and Alien Weaponry.

New Zealand has a national orchestra, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, and many regional orchestras. A number of New Zealand composers have developed international reputations. The best-known include Douglas Lilburn, John Psathas, Jack Body, Gillian Whitehead, Jenny McLeod, Gareth Farr, and Ross Harris.

==Māori music==
Pre-Colonial Māori produced a range of music. This included song &quot;waiata .&quot; The haka is a form of song that is accompanied with movement. Songs included lullabies, laments and love songs, and as an oral culture were used for education, to remember history and many other things. The emotionally charged circumstances under which waiata were composed are reflected in their highly poetic language, which is rich with allusion, metaphor and imagery. (Rawinia Higgins and Arini Loader 2014) Songs and music were part of Te Whare Tapere, pre-European Māori entertainment events that included &#x27;storytelling, songs and singing, dance and dancing, musical instruments, puppets&#x27; and games.

Some Māori song includes microtonal music, the song poetry form mōteatea. SOUNZ Centre for New Zealand Music published a series in 2021 called &quot;He Reo Tawhito: Conversations about Mōteatea&quot; where Crystal Edwards interviewed various specialists including Te Ahukaramū Charles Royal, Hōhepa Te Rito, Hana O&#x27;Regan and Taiarahia Black..

===Taonga pūoro===

Pre-Colonial instrumental music used taonga pūoro () - a variety of blown, struck and twirled instruments made out of hollowed-out wood, stone, whale ivory, albatross bone, and human bone. The pūkāea (wooden trumpet), hue (gourd), and pūtātara (conch-shell trumpet) fulfilled many functions within pre-colonial Māori society, including a call to arms, announcing the dawning of a new day, communications with the gods and the planting of crops. From the late 20th century Dr Richard Nunns (1945–2021), Hirini Melbourne (1949–2003), and Brian Flintoff revived the use of taonga pūoro.

===Contemporary Māori music===

European settlers brought new harmonies and instruments, which Māori composers gradually adopted. The action song (&quot;waiata-ā-ringa&quot;) largely developed in the early 20th century. Māori also gravitated towards Hawaiian music from artists like Ernest Kaʻai and David Lucla Kaili that toured New Zealand in the 1900s to 1920s, leading the adoption of steel guitars pioneered by Eruera Mati Hita. 

In the mid- to late-20th century, Māori singers and songwriters like Howard Morrison (1935–2009), Prince Tui Teka (1937–1985), Dalvanius Prime (1948–2002), Moana Maniapoto (1961- ) and Hinewehi Mohi (1964- ) developed a distinctive Māori-influenced style. Some artists; like Alien Weaponry have released Māori-language songs, and the Māori traditional art of &quot;kapa haka&quot; (song and dance) has had a resurgence.

====Māori show-bands====

Māori show-bands formed in New Zealand and Australia from the 1950s. The groups performed in a wide variety of musical genres, dance styles, and with cabaret skills, infusing their acts with comedy drawn straight from Māori culture. Some Māori show-bands would begin their performances in traditional Māori costume before changing into suits and sequinned gowns. Billy T. James (1949–1991) spent many years overseas in show bands, beginning in the Maori Volcanics.

==Radio airplay==
The New Zealand recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards. The Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) publishes New Zealand&#x27;s official weekly record charts. The Association also holds the annual New Zealand Music Awards which were first held in 1965 as the Loxene Golden Disc awards.

Despite the vitality of New Zealand bands in the pub scene, for many years commercial radio was reluctant to play locally produced material and by 1995 only 1.6% of all songs played on commercial radio stations were of New Zealand origin. In 1997 a government &quot;Kiwi Music Action Group&quot; was formed to compel radio stations to broadcast New Zealand music. The group initiated New Zealand Music Week and in 2000 this grew into &quot;New Zealand Music Month&quot;. By 2005 New Zealand content averaged between 19 and 20 percent.

==Pop==
New Zealand&#x27;s first pop song was &quot;Blue Smoke&quot;, written in the 1940s by Ruru Karaitiana. Pixie Williams recorded the song in 1949 and, although it went triple platinum in New Zealand, the award for selling 50,000 copies of the song was only presented to Pixie Williams on 13 July 2011. The advent of music television shows in the 1960s led to the rise of Sandy Edmonds, one of New Zealand&#x27;s first pop stars.

===Split Enz and Crowded House===

Formed in the early 1970s and variously featuring Phil Judd and brothers Tim Finn and Neil Finn, Split Enz achieved chart success in New Zealand, Australia, and Canada ‒ most notably with their 1980 single &quot;I Got You&quot; – and built a cult following elsewhere. The music videos for some of the band&#x27;s 1980s songs were among the first played on MTV. In 1985, Neil Finn formed pop rock band Crowded House in Melbourne, Australia. The other founding members were Australians Paul Hester and Nick Seymour. Later band members included Neil&#x27;s brother Tim Finn and Americans Mark Hart and Matt Sherrod. Originally active from 1985 to 1996, the band had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, &quot;Crowded House&quot;, which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits, &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot; and &quot;Something So Strong&quot;. Further international success came in the UK and Europe with their third and fourth albums, &quot;Woodface&quot; and &quot;Together Alone&quot; and the compilation album &quot;Recurring Dream&quot;, which included the hits &quot;Fall at Your Feet&quot;, &quot;Weather with You&quot;, &quot;Distant Sun&quot;, &quot;Locked Out&quot;, &quot;Instinct&quot; and &quot;Not the Girl You Think You Are&quot;. Queen Elizabeth II bestowed an OBE on both Neil and Tim Finn in June 1993 for their contribution to the music of New Zealand.

===Dave Dobbyn===

After the dissolution of his band DD Smash, singer-songwriter Dave Dobbyn began a successful solo career, writing the soundtrack music for the animated feature film &quot;Footrot Flats: The Dog&#x27;s Tale&quot; in 1986. The film yielded two hit singles: &quot;You Oughta Be In Love&quot; (1986) and the chart-topping &quot;Slice of Heaven&quot; (1986), recorded with the band Herbs. After the release of the film, &quot;Slice of Heaven&quot; became one of Dobbyn&#x27;s best-known songs, frequently used in tourism advertisements aired on Australian television that encouraged people to visit New Zealand. With the success of the song in Australia, Dobbyn settled in Australia.

Dobbyn&#x27;s hit song &quot;Loyal&quot; (1988) from his debut solo album &quot;Loyal&quot; (1988) was used as an anthem for Team New Zealand&#x27;s unsuccessful 2003 America&#x27;s Cup defence.

In 2005, Dobbyn released his sixth solo album, &quot;Available Light&quot;. It received popular and critical acclaim. In the same year Dobbyn performed the lead single from &quot;Available Light&quot;, &quot;Welcome Home&quot; (2005) at the New Zealand Music Awards awards ceremony. During the performance, Ahmed Zaoui, who was appealing a security certificate issued due to alleged links to terrorist groups, appeared on stage with Dobbyn.

===Don McGlashan===

Composer, singer and multi-instrumentalist Don McGlashan won fame with bands Blam Blam Blam, The Front Lawn, and The Mutton Birds, before pursuing a solo career. McGlashan&#x27;s first hits were with band Blam Blam Blam in the early 1980s. He later released four albums as lead singer and writer for The Mutton Birds. McGlashan&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Warm Hand&quot;, was released in May 2006. It was nominated for an NZ Music Award for album of the year, and debut single &quot;Miracle Sun&quot; was a nominee for New Zealand&#x27;s supreme songwriting award, the APRA Silver Scroll. He has composed extensively for cinema and television.

===Bic Runga===

Singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist pop artist Bic Runga released her first solo album &quot;Drive&quot; in 1997. It debuted at number one on the New Zealand Top 40 Album charts. Runga has since become one of the highest-selling New Zealand artists in recent history. She has also found success internationally in Australia, Ireland, and, to some extent, in the UK. In the 2006 New Year Honours Runga was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to music.

===Lorde===
In September 2013, 16-year-old singer Lorde (Ella Yelich-O&#x27;Connor) became the youngest solo artist to ever reach number one on the US singles chart with &quot;Royals&quot;. The song from her album &quot;Pure Heroine&quot; went on to win Best Pop Performance and Song of the Year at the 2014 Grammy Awards.

===Top-selling singles and albums===
The top-selling New Zealand pop song of all time is &quot;How Bizarre&quot; by OMC. The song went to number one in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Ireland, South Africa and Austria. It spent 36 weeks on the United States Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs) charts, peaking at number 4. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, and it made the Top 10 in Portugal and Israel.

In 2008, folk parody duo Flight of the Conchords found international success with their eponymous album. The album debuted at number three on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling about 52,000 copies in its first week.

In 2011, New Zealand singer Kimbra collaborated with Belgian-Australian singer Gotye on his song &quot;Somebody That I Used To Know&quot;. The song topped the US, UK, Australian and 23 other national charts, and reached the top 10 in more than 30 countries around the world. The song has sold more than 13 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling digital singles of all time.

In 2020, New Zealand singer Benee&#x27;s single Supalonely went viral on video sharing app TikTok. It subsequently went to chart in the Top 40 of many major music markets, including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

==Rock, alternative rock and indie rock==
The first rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll hit by a New Zealander was Johnny Devlin&#x27;s hit &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;, which sold 100,000 copies in 1959–60, after which rock began gaining in popularity over the 1960s. Prominent bands included The La De Da&#x27;s, Ray Columbus &amp; The Invaders, and The Fourmyula.

By the late 1970s, some New Zealand rock bands were finding national success, including Th&#x27; Dudes (whose guitarist Dave Dobbyn formed DD Smash in the 1980s), Dragon, Hello Sailor and Split Enz, fronted by Tim Finn, and later, his brother Neil Finn, who went on to form Crowded House. Independent music in New Zealand began emerging in the latter half of the 1970s, with the development of a punk rock scene. In 1979, the &quot;AK79&quot; compilation was released, compiling the recordings of many early Auckland punk groups. 

Several independent labels like Propeller Records in Auckland and Flying Nun Records in Christchurch were established in the early 1980s, and became influential in the development of New Zealand rock music and indie rock globally. The Clean from Dunedin was the first major band to feature on Flying Nun, releasing several hit singles inside New Zealand and touring internationally. Most of the first wave of artists signed to the label originated from Dunedin and Christchurch, helping to develop what became called the &quot;Dunedin sound&quot;, or Flying Nun sound. The distinctive jangle-pop and lo-fi sound was pioneered by bands such as The Chills, The Verlaines, Sneaky Feelings, The Bats and The Jean-Paul Sartre Experience.

Rock band Shihad was formed by vocalist/guitarist Jon Toogood and drummer Tom Larkin in 1988. The band found wide popularity in New Zealand over the following decade, playing a mixture of modern rock, post-grunge and pop-rock. Shihad has had three number one albums in New Zealand.

Other notable rock bands popular in the 1990s include the Headless Chickens, The Mutton Birds, The Exponents, The Feelers, Supergroove and Push Push.

==Hip hop==

The first major New Zealand hip hop hit was &quot;Hip Hop Holiday&quot; by 3 The Hard Way. Sampling the song &quot;Dreadlock Holiday&quot; by 10CC, it went to number one for several weeks in early 1994. Many of New Zealand&#x27;s first hip hop performers, such as Dalvanius Prime, whose &quot;Poi E&quot; was a number one hit, were Māori. Released in 1984, &quot;Poi E&quot; was sung entirely in the Māori language and featured a blend of Māori cultural practices in the song and accompanying music video, including Māori chanting, poi dancing, and the wearing of traditional Māori garments.

The first entire album of locally produced hip hop was Upper Hutt Posse&#x27;s &quot;E Tu&quot; EP, from 1988. &quot;E Tu&quot; was partially in Māori and partially in English, and its lyrics were politically charged. The song &quot;E Tu&quot; combined African-American revolutionary rhetoric with an explicitly Māori frame of reference. It paid homage to the rebel Māori warrior chiefs of New Zealand&#x27;s colonial history: Hōne Heke, Te Kooti, and Te Rauparaha.

In the 1990s, the New Zealand hip hop scene grew with the evolution of Pacific Island-influenced hip hop. Phil Fuemana, Kosmo, Brother D and Pacific Underground played an important role in the growth of &quot;Pasifika&quot; hip hop. OMC&#x27;s 1996 single &quot;How Bizarre&quot; combined Pauly Fuemana&#x27;s Nieuean background, a Pacific Island guitar style and hip hop beats to create a uniquely New Zealand-Polynesian sound. This was followed by Che Fu&#x27;s album &quot;2 B s-Pacific&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Urban Pacifica&quot; in 1999, a compilation of Pasifika hip hop. Artists including Scribe, Tiki Taane, P-Money and Ladi6 localised rap.

In 2005, Savage, a New Zealand Samoan hip hop artist, had back-to-back number one hits with &quot;Swing&quot; and &quot;Moonshine&quot;, the latter featuring US artist Akon. &quot;Swing&quot; was used in the 2007 film &quot;Knocked Up&quot; and sold more than 1.8 million copies in the United States, making it almost double platinum. The song also appeared on the US compilation &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! 29&quot;.

==Roots, reggae, and dub==

Formed in 1979, Herbs are a New Zealand reggae vocal group and the 11th inductee into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame. In 1986, the song &quot;Slice of Heaven&quot; with Dave Dobbyn reached number one on both the New Zealand and Australian charts. In 1989, Tim Finn joined them for the Parihaka festival and, in 1992, Annie Crummer fronted the hit single &quot;See What Love Can Do&quot;. Herbs are considered pioneers of the Pacific reggae sound, having paved the way for contemporary New Zealand reggae groups such as Breaks Co-op, Fat Freddy&#x27;s Drop, Katchafire, Kora, The Black Seeds, Salmonella Dub, 1814, Tahuna Breaks, Six60 and Trinity Roots.

==Electronica==

Electronic music in New Zealand constitutes a relatively small but growing trend in the country&#x27;s musical culture especially with the rise of acts such as Concord Dawn, Minuit and Shapeshifter in the last 15 years.

An early example of New Zealand electronica is a track called &quot;Pulsing&quot; released in 1982 by The Body Electric. In 1988 Propeller Records released New Zealand&#x27;s first House record, Jam This Record. Other New Zealand house DJs who rose to prominence include DLT. The Future Jazz scene (the term was first coined in Auckland in the early 1990s) developed in Auckland, most notably in the Cause Celebre nightclub and the work of Nathan Haines. Two popular early Nathan Haines releases were &quot;Freebass Live at Cause Celebre&quot; and Haines&#x27; &quot;Shift Left&quot;. A proponent of this sound and an ex-pat artist who is still active in this area is Mark de Clive-Lowe.

==Heavy metal==
New Zealand heavy metal bands include Devilskin, the extreme metal bands Ulcerate, Dawn of Azazel and 8 Foot Sativa and the alternative metal band Blindspott, currently known as Blacklistt. In 2016 groove metal band Alien Weaponry, several of whose songs are in the Māori language, won Smokefreerockquest and Smokefree Pacifica beats. Other bands include Antagonist A.D., Legacy of Disorder, Human, Black Boned Angel, Beastwars, Demoniac, Diocletian, In Dread Response, Saving Grace, Sinate, Push Push, Razorwyre, HLAH, and Knightshade.

The 2015 New Zealand comedy horror film &quot;Deathgasm&quot; soundtrack gave rise to various metal groups.

Shepherds Reign is a Polynesian band that play mostly heavy metal music. They released their album &quot;Ala Mai&quot; in 2023. The majority of the songs are sung in Samoan.

==Blues==

The history of blues in New Zealand dates from the 1960s. The earliest blues influences on New Zealand musicians originated with white British blues musicians like The Animals and The Rolling Stones, and later the blues-tinged rock of groups such as Led Zeppelin. The first American blues artist to make a big impact in New Zealand was Stevie Ray Vaughan in the early 1980s. Other blues-related genres such as soul and gospel almost completely by-passed New Zealand audiences, except for a handful of hits from cross-over artists such as Ray Charles. New Zealand does not have its own distinctive blues style.

==European folk music==
The Wellerman sea shanty originated in New Zealand.
===Brass bands===

New Zealand has a proud history of brass bands, with regular provincial contests.

===Highland pipe bands===
Pipe bands became widespread during the early 20th century. New Zealand is said to have more pipebands per person than Scotland; historical links are maintained by Caledonian Societies throughout the country.

==Classical and art music==

The formal traditions of European classical music took a long time to develop in New Zealand due to the country&#x27;s geographical isolation. Composers such as Alfred Hill were educated in Europe and brought late Romantic Music traditions to New Zealand. He attempted to graft them on to New Zealand themes with one notable success, the popular &quot;Waiata Poi&quot;. However, before 1960 New Zealand did not have a distinct classical style of its own, having &quot;a tendency to over-criticise home-produced goods&quot;.

Douglas Lilburn, working predominantly in the third quarter of the 20th century, is often credited with being the first composer to compose with a truly New Zealand voice and gain international recognition. Lilburn&#x27;s &quot;Second Piano Sonatina&quot; was described as &quot;a work which seems to draw on the best of Lilburn&#x27;s past...specially suited to New Zealand.&quot; He went on to pioneer electronic music in New Zealand.

In 2004, Wellington composer John Psathas achieved the largest audience for New Zealand-composed music when his fanfares and other music were heard by billions during the opening and closing ceremonies of the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics.

In 2019 Gareth Farr was a recipient of a New Zealand Arts Laureate Award in recognition of his music which has included composing for the Royal New Zealand Ballet, &quot;Maui One Man Against The Gods&quot; and the 2008 work &quot;Terra Incognita&quot;, for bass baritone solo, choir and orchestra, performed by Paul Whelan, the Orpheus Choir and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Paul MacAlindin.

There are two twelve-month Composer-in-Residence positions available in New Zealand, the Mozart Fellowship at the University of Otago and the NZSM Composer in Residence in Wellington.

===Orchestras and chamber music===
The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra (NZSO) is New Zealand&#x27;s national orchestra, funded by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. The Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra is New Zealand&#x27;s second and only other full-time professional orchestra. There are also a number of semi-professional regional orchestras, presenting their own concert series each year. These include the Opus Chamber Orchestra in Hamilton, Orchestra Wellington, the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra (CSO) and the Dunedin Symphony Orchestra (DSO), formerly the Southern Sinfonia.

The New Zealand String Quartet and the NZTrio both perform locally and internationally. The NZTrio specialises in contemporary art music.

===Choirs===
New Zealand has a strong choral tradition. The Anglican cathedrals in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch have choirs of a high standard and there are also a number of secular New Zealand choirs including the New Zealand Youth Choir, Voices New Zealand Chamber Choir, City Choir Dunedin, Auckland Choral Society and Christchurch City Choir. Many of these choirs perform around New Zealand and compete against other choirs internationally.

===Opera===

Opera has been produced in New Zealand since colonisation. New Zealand has produced a number of internationally famous opera singers, including Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Sir Donald McIntyre, Simon O&#x27;Neill, Jonathan Lemalu, Teddy Tahu Rhodes, Anna Leese, and Dame Malvina Major. Frances Alda and Joan Hammond were both well-known New Zealand-born opera singers.

There is a biennial competition the Lexus Song Quest, winners include Dame Malvina Major, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, Phillip Rhodes, Jonathan Lemalu and Amitai Pati.

New Zealand Opera is the country&#x27;s sole professional opera company. The company stages up to three operas a year in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, and features international as well as New Zealand soloists.

===Soloists===
Prominent New Zealand musicians performing internationally include pianists Michael Houstoun, Jeffrey Grice, John Chen, and singer Hayley Westenra.

==Musical theatre==
The most well-known musical theatre production written by a New Zealander is the Rocky Horror Show musical, written by Richard O&#x27;Brien, and first performed on stage in London during 1973.

<doc id="180483" wikidata="Q221757" url="?curid=180483" title="Un ballo in maschera">
<text>Un ballo in maschera (&#x27;A Masked Ball&#x27;) is an 1859 opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi. The text, by Antonio Somma, was based on Eugène Scribe&#x27;s libretto for Daniel Auber&#x27;s 1833 five act opera, &quot;Gustave III, ou Le bal masqué&quot;.

The plot concerns the assassination in 1792 of King Gustav III of Sweden who was shot, as the result of a political conspiracy, while attending a masked ball, dying of his wounds thirteen days later.

It was to take over two years between the commission from Naples, planned for a production there, and its premiere performance at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on 17 February 1859. In becoming the &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; which we know today, Verdi&#x27;s opera (and his libretto) underwent a significant series of transformations and title changes, caused by a combination of censorship regulations in both Naples and Rome, as well as by the political situation in France in January 1858. Based on the Scribe libretto and begun as &quot;Gustavo III&quot; set in Stockholm, it became &quot;Una vendetta in domino&quot; set in Stettin, and finally &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; set in Boston during the colonial era. It became one of the most frustrating experiences of Verdi&#x27;s career.

From the mid-20th century, it has become more common for the setting to revert to its original 18th-century Stockholm location. A re-creation of the original &quot;Gustavo III&quot; has been staged in Sweden.

==Composition history==
: &quot;For a full account of the evolution of the opera which eventually became &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;, see Gustavo III (Verdi)&quot;

===1857: From &quot;Gustavo III&quot; to &quot;Una vendetta in domino&quot;===
A commission by the Teatro San Carlo in Naples in early 1857 led Verdi to begin to oversee the finalization of the libretto (also by Somma) for &quot;Re Lear&quot; with the aim of presenting the finished opera during the 1858 carnival season. When this proved to be impracticable, Verdi turned to the subject of King Gustav III&#x27;s assassination as portrayed in Scribe and Auber&#x27;s opera, albeit not an historically accurate narrative. That subject was well known and had been used by other composers, including Saverio Mercadante for his &quot;Il reggente&quot; in 1843.

For the libretto, Scribe retained the names of some of the historical figures involved (including fortune teller Ulrica Arfvidsson, the conspiracy, and the killing at the masked ball, but, as noted by Budden, &quot;it was a simple case of &#x27;cherchez la femme&#x27;&quot;: for the rest of the play Scribe invented the romance between the King and the fictional Amélie, the wife of the king&#x27;s secretary and best friend, and adds characters and situations such as Oscar, the page boy.

Somma&#x27;s new libretto, known as &quot;Gustavo III&quot;, was presented to the censors in Naples by late 1857. By November, Verdi informed Somma that objections had been raised and revisions demanded by the censors, the most significant of which was the refusal to allow the depiction of a monarch on the stage - and especially the monarch&#x27;s murder. As had happened with &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, changes in characters&#x27; names and titles were proposed (the King of Sweden became the Duke of Pomerania; Anckarström became Count Renato) and the location was moved from Stockholm to Stettin.

Working together with Somma over Christmas, Verdi accommodated these changes. Somma was asked to change the names of the characters on the &quot;Gustave&quot; libretto while Verdi worked on completing sketches of the music. The name of the opera became &quot;Una vendetta in domino&quot;.

By 9 January 1858, prior to setting out for Naples, Verdi wrote from his home to the San Carlo that &quot;the opera is done and even here I am working on the full score&quot;. The composer then travelled to Naples and rehearsals of &quot;Una vendetta&quot; were about to begin when, on 14 January 1858, three Italians attempted to assassinate Emperor Napoleon III in Paris, an event which was to affect the opera&#x27;s production.

===1858: The censor blocks &quot;Una vendetta&quot;===
The imposition of still further, more stringent requirements by the censor incurred Verdi&#x27;s wrath. He broke his contract, returned to Sant&#x27;Agata in April, and was sued by the management of the San Carlo house. This provoked him to lodge a counter-claim against the theatre for damages and, eventually, the legal fight ended.

It was during this period of turmoil that Verdi was to describe the previous sixteen years of his composing life: in a letter to Countess Clara Maffei, he states: &quot;From &quot;Nabucco&quot;, you may say, I have never had one hour of peace. Sixteen years in the galleys!&quot;

===1859: &quot;Una vendetta&quot; becomes &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;===
When the legal issues were resolved within a few months, Verdi was free to present the libretto and musical outline of &quot;Gustave III&quot; (which was basically &quot;Una vendetta&quot; with characters&#x27; names and locations changed) to the Rome Opera. There, the censors demanded further changes. Removing the action from Europe, the location became Boston during the British colonial period and the leading character became Riccardo, the Count (or Earl) of Warwick. At this point, the opera became &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; set in North America.

==Performance history==
===Notable productions===
&quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; received its premiere performance at the Teatro Apollo in Rome on 17 February 1859 and was immediately successful. The opera was first seen in the US in New York on 11 February 1861 at the Academy of Music in Manhattan for seven performances, conducted by Emanuele Muzio; the future president Abraham Lincoln attended one of the performances. Two further performances were given at the old Brooklyn Academy of Music on Montague Street. The first performance in the UK was on 15 June of that year.

In the 20th century, especially after a 1935 production in Copenhagen, many modern stagings have restored the original Swedish setting and characters&#x27; names. On 7 January 1955, Marian Anderson, singing the role of Ulrica, broke the &quot;color barrier&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, becoming the first African-American vocal soloist to appear with that company.

A &quot;hypothetical reconstruction&quot; of &quot;Gustavo III&quot;, based on the unorchestrated original and much of &quot;Una vendetta&quot; &quot;grafted&quot; onto &quot;Un ballo&quot;″s score, occurred in a production by the Gothenburg Opera in Gothenburg, Sweden in 2002.

The opera has become a staple of the repertoire and is now performed frequently.

===Homosexuality of Gustav III===

Scribe&#x27;s libretto for &quot;Gustave III&quot; includes details that could be understood as signs of the king&#x27;s homosexuality. Verdi and Somma eliminated many of these coded signals, but new codes take their place, particularly relating to the character of Oscar. David Richards has argued that although the opera was no longer explicitly based on Gustav III, Verdi deliberately deviated from his usual practice and set Oscar for a soprano – despite disliking women singing men&#x27;s parts: &quot;Verdi goes as far as one could go within the repressive conventions of his period to portray Gustavo (based on a widely known flamboyantly homosexual ruler) as either a gay man or, at a minimum, a bisexual man&quot;. Richards believes this therefore demonstrates that &quot;Verdi&#x27;s art embraces all forms of sexualities&quot;. Ralph Hexter has examined the “masking” of homosexual aspects of the main character and how it relates to the idea of masking in the opera as a whole.
Several productions have attempted to draw out this suggestion – most notably the staging by Göran Gentele for the Royal Swedish Opera in 1959 where Gustavo is having an affair with his Oscar even while pining for Amelia, and also the 1993 staging by Götz Friedrich for Berlin.

== Roles ==

==Synopsis==
:Place: Stockholm, Sweden, or Boston, Massachusetts
:Time: March 1792 in Sweden, or the end of the 17th century in Boston
===Act 1===
&quot;Scene 1: A public audience at Riccardo&#x27;s palace, attended by his supporters, but also by his enemies who hope for his demise.&quot;

Riccardo (Gustavo) reviews the list of guests who will attend an upcoming masked ball. He is elated to see the name of the woman he loves on the list – Amelia, the wife of his friend and advisor, Renato (Count Anckarström). (Aria: &quot;La rivedrò nell&#x27;estasi&quot; / &quot;There I will be in ecstasy to see her again&quot;). When Renato arrives, he tries to warn Riccardo about the growing conspiracy against him (aria: &quot;Alla vita che t&#x27;arride&quot; / &quot;Your life, so full of joy and hope&quot;), but Riccardo refuses to listen to his words.

Next, Riccardo is presented with a complaint against a fortune-teller named Ulrica (Madame Arvidson), accused of witchcraft. A magistrate calls for her banishment, but Oscar the page defends her (Aria: &quot;Volta la terrea&quot; / &quot;Turning her eyes from the earth&quot;). Riccardo resolves to investigate for himself and tells the members of the court to disguise themselves and to meet him at Ulrica&#x27;s lodging later that day.

&quot;Scene 2: At Ulrica&#x27;s dwelling&quot;

Ulrica summons her magical powers: &quot;Re dell&#x27;abisso, affrettati&quot; / &quot;King of the abyss, make haste&quot;. Disguised as a fisherman, Riccardo arrives before the others. He makes the fortune of a sailor named Silvano come true by spiriting a document of promotion into his pouch, convincing the crowd of the truth of Ulrica&#x27;s powers. When he realizes that Amelia is coming to see Ulrica, he hides and watches. Alone with Ulrica, Amelia confesses that she is tormented by her love for Riccardo, and asks for a means to bring peace to her heart. Ulrica tells her to gather a certain herb with magical powers; Riccardo resolves to be there when she does so. Amelia leaves.

Now Riccardo presents himself again, along with all of the courtiers, and asks to have his fortune told. (Aria: &quot;Di&#x27; tu se fedele&quot; / &quot;Tell me if the sea awaits me faithfully&quot;). Ulrica reveals that he will be killed by the next man who shakes his hand. He laughingly dismisses her prophecy and offers his hand to the courtiers, who refuse to take it. Renato arrives and shakes Riccardo&#x27;s hand in greeting. Riccardo&#x27;s true identity is now revealed and he is acclaimed by the people.

===Act 2===
&quot;On the outskirts of the town, at the gallows-place. Midnight&quot;

Amelia, conquering her fears, has come here alone to pick the herb of which Ulrica told her (Aria: &quot;Ma dall&#x27;arido stelo divulsa&quot; / &quot;But when I have plucked the herb&quot;). She is surprised by Riccardo, who has come to meet her, and the two finally declare their love for each other.

Unexpectedly, Renato arrives, and Amelia covers her face with her veil before he can recognize her. Renato explains to Riccardo that the conspirators are pursuing him, and his life is in danger. Riccardo leaves, making Renato promise to escort the veiled woman safely back to town, not asking her identity.
When the conspirators arrive, they confront Renato; in the struggle, Amelia&#x27;s veil drops. Renato assumes that Amelia and Riccardo have been involved in an adulterous love affair. He asks the two leaders of the conspiracy, Samuel and Tom, to meet him the next day.

===Act 3===

&quot;Scene 1: Renato&#x27;s house&quot;
Renato has resolved to kill Amelia for the dishonor she has brought on him. She protests her innocence and begs to see her son one last time. (Aria: &quot;Morrò, ma prima in grazia&quot; / &quot;I will die, but first, a kindness&quot;). Renato relents, and declares that it is Riccardo, not Amelia, who deserves to die (Aria: &quot;Eri tu che macchiavi quell&#x27;anima&quot; / &quot;You were the one who stained her soul&quot;).

Samuel (Count Ribbing) and Tom (Count Horn) arrive, and Renato asks to join their plot, pledging the life of his son as proof of his sincerity. They agree to draw lots to decide who will kill Riccardo. Amelia is forced to draw the winning name – Renato.

Oscar, the page, arrives with invitations to the masked ball; Samuel, Tom and Renato agree that this is where the assassination will take place.

&quot;Scene 2: The ball&quot;

Riccardo, torn between love and duty, has resolved to renounce his love for Amelia and send her and Renato back to England (Aria: &quot;Ma se m&#x27;è forza perderti&quot; / &quot;But if I am forced to lose her&quot;).

At the ball, Renato tries to learn from Oscar what costume Riccardo is wearing. Oscar at first refuses to tell (Aria: &quot;Saper vorreste&quot; / &quot;You want to know&quot;), but finally answers: a black cloak and a red ribbon. Riccardo manages to identify Amelia and tells her of the decision he has made. As they say goodbye, Renato stabs Riccardo. The wounded Riccardo discloses that though he loved Amelia, she never broke her marriage vows. He pardons all the conspirators, bidding farewell to his friends and his country as he dies.

==Music==

The prelude to the piece is composed of themes from the opening scene of the opera, with dramatic contrast between the music of Riccardo&#x27;s devoted courtiers and the dark mutterings of those who hate him. This is followed by a transition to a love theme, the melody of Riccardo&#x27;s first aria &quot; La rivedrà nell&#x27;estasi&quot;.

Influence of French opera is felt in the first scene, both in the vocal writing for Oscar the page-boy, sprinkled with coloratura effects, and in the closing ensemble in which Riccardo invites everyone to visit the witch&#x27;s den in disguise. The music of this ensemble combines French-style elan and a sense of &quot;joie de vivre&quot; with continued low grumblings from those plotting Riccardo&#x27;s assassination.

The second scene of the first act is preceded by a dramatic orchestral prelude, with dark instrumental colourings. Riccardo&#x27;s light-hearted character is developed in the aria he sings in the disguise of a fisherman &quot;Di&#x27; tu se fedele&quot;, with the characteristics of a barcarolle. Ulrica&#x27;s prophecy of Riccardo&#x27;s assassination sets off a quintet with chorus in which Riccardo laughingly rejects the warning as nonsense, the conspirators express their dismay at having seemingly been found out, Ulrica insists that her prophecy is no joke and Oscar has the highest vocal line expressing his grief at the thought of Riccardo&#x27;s murder. The act ends with a patriotic anthem like theme for the chorus juxtaposed with different vocal lines for the principals.

The second act begins with a stormy orchestral introduction. The grand scene for the soprano which follows is multi-sectioned with a slow accompanied by solo cor anglais, then a dramatic and quick middle section as Amelia is terrified by an apparition, and a slower anguished prayer with a final cadenza calling for an exceptional range from high to low. The following love duet is also multi-sectioned, building to a rapturous climax. A quartet with chorus closes the act, with radically different emotions once again being conveyed simultaneously in a single piece of music – the sardonic, mocking laughter of the conspirators, the anguish of Amelia and the implacable hatred and desire for revenge of her husband.

Act 3, scene 1, is notable for Amelia&#x27;s mournful aria with cello obbligato &quot;Morrò, ma prima in grazia&quot; and for the celebrated baritone aria &quot;Eri tu&quot;, which begins in a fast minor key and ends in a slow major key, reversing the usual order of Italian operatic arias at this time, which had the slow section first. The conspirators return accompanied by the same contrapuntal theme which depicted them in the prelude and accompanied their appearance in the previous scene. With the entrance of Oscar, the music again acquires something of the spirit of French &quot;opéra comique&quot;, closing with a quintet in which Oscar&#x27;s glittery and cheerful vocal line is underpinned by the music expressing Amelia&#x27;s fears and the conspirators&#x27; thirst for vengeance.

The music of the aria for Riccardo that opens the final scene delineates the character&#x27;s evolution from a selfish and light-hearted pleasure seeker to a serious man who will sacrifice his own happiness in order to do what he now recognises as the right thing. An offstage banda is heard playing dance music as the scene switches to the ball. Once again Oscar&#x27;s music introduces the spirit of French opera-comique with his sparkling song &quot;Saper vorreste&quot;. A string ensemble onstage plays dance music as Riccardo and Amelia bid farewell in a duet, which is interrupted by Renato&#x27;s stabbing of Riccardo. The musicians, unaware of what has happened, continue to play their music for some bars after this event. An ensemble with harp develops as Riccardo forgives his murderer and the opera ends with an exclamation of horror from all.

The music of the piece is remarkable for its great variety, its vivid and dramatic combinations of varying emotions into one piece of music as in the ensembles in the first and second acts, and its blending of the conventions of Italian serious opera with the spirit of French opera comique.

==Instrumentation==
The opera is scored for flute, piccolo, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, cimbasso, timpani, cymbals, bass drum, harp and strings, together with offstage wind band, offstage bell and small onstage string orchestra (four to six first violins, two second violins, two violas, two cellos and two double basses).

==Cultural references==

A rehearsal of act 3, scene 2, including the stabbing of Riccardo, is featured in the closing scene of Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;La Luna&quot;.

It also confused Leslie Titmuss in John Mortimer&#x27;s novel &quot;Titmuss Regained&quot;; when a friend said that she was going to see &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; at Covent Garden, he replied &quot;never been one for dancing&quot;.
