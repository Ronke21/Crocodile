<text>Heinz Wilhelm Guderian (; 17 June 1888 – 14 May 1954) was a German general during World War II who, after the war, became a successful memoirist. An early pioneer and advocate of the &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; approach, he played a central role in the development of the panzer division concept. In 1936, he became the Inspector of Motorized Troops.

At the beginning of the Second World War, Guderian led an armoured corps in the Invasion of Poland. During the Invasion of France, he commanded the armoured units that attacked through the Ardennes forest and overwhelmed the Allied defenses at the Battle of Sedan. He led the 2nd Panzer Army during Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. The campaign ended in failure after the German offensive Operation Typhoon failed to capture Moscow, after which Guderian was dismissed.

In early 1943, Adolf Hitler appointed Guderian to the newly created position of Inspector General of Armoured Troops. In this role, he had broad responsibility to rebuild and train new panzer forces but saw limited success due to Germany&#x27;s worsening war economy. Guderian was appointed Acting Chief of the General Staff of the Army High Command, immediately following the 20 July Plot to assassinate Hitler.

Guderian was placed in charge of the &quot;Court of Honour&quot; by Hitler, which in the aftermath of the plot was used to dismiss people from the military so they could be tried in the &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot; and executed. He was Hitler&#x27;s personal advisor on the Eastern Front and became closely associated with the Nazis. Guderian&#x27;s troops carried out the criminal Commissar Order during Barbarossa, and he was implicated in the commission of reprisals after the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.

Guderian surrendered to the United States forces on 10 May 1945 and was interned until 1948. He was released without charge and retired to write his memoirs. Entitled &quot;Memoirs of a Soldier&quot;, the autobiography was published in 1950 and became a bestseller. Guderian&#x27;s writings have received some backlash in the decades since their release, with a number of historians finding the original works to contain post-war myths, including that of the &quot;clean Wehrmacht&quot;. Guderian&#x27;s autobiography portrayed himself as the sole originator of the German panzer force and refused the stipulation that units under his command committed crimes of war. These criticisms were partially addressed in his 1952 re-release edition of the book, newly entitled &quot;Panzer Leader&quot;, which mended certain historically inaccurate errors and introduced a foreword from B. H. Liddell Hart. Guderian died in 1954 and was buried in Goslar.

==Early life and World War I==
Guderian was born in Kulm, West Prussia (since 1920 Poland), on 17 June 1888, the son of Friedrich and Clara (née Kirchhoff). His father and grandfathers were Prussian officers and he grew up in garrison towns surrounded by the military. In 1903, he left home and enrolled at a military cadet school. He was a capable student, although he performed poorly in his final exam. He entered the army as an officer cadet on 28 February 1907 with the 10th Hanoverian Light Infantry Battalion (&quot;Hannoversche Jäger-Bataillon Nr. 10&quot;) , under his father&#x27;s command. He became a second lieutenant on 27 January 1908, receiving his patent backdated to 22 June 1906. On 1 October 1913 he married Margarete Goerne, with whom he had two sons: Heinz Günther (1914–2004) and Kurt (1918–1984).

At the outbreak of World War I, Guderian served as a communications officer and the commander of a radio station. In November, 1914 he was promoted to first lieutenant. Between May, 1915 and January, 1916 Guderian was in charge of signals intelligence for the 4th Army. He fought at the Battle of Verdun during this period and was promoted to captain on 15 November 1915. He was then sent to the 4th Infantry Division before becoming commander of the Second Battalion of Infantry Regiment 14. On 28 February 1918, Guderian was appointed to the General Staff Corps. Guderian finished the war as an operations officer in occupied Italy. He disagreed with Germany signing the armistice in 1918, believing that the German Empire should have continued the fight.

==Interwar period==
Early in 1919, Guderian was selected as one of the four thousand officers allowed by the Versailles Treaty in the reduced-size German army, the Reichswehr. He was assigned to serve on the staff of the central command of the Eastern Frontier Guard Service which was intended to control and coordinate the independent &quot;freikorps&quot; units in the defense of Germany&#x27;s eastern frontiers against Polish (who were not attacking Germany) and Soviet forces engaged in the Russian Civil War in conjunction with the Estonian War of Independence. In June, 1919 Guderian joined the Iron Brigade (later known as the Iron Division) as its second General Staff officer.
In the 1920s, Guderian was introduced to armored warfare tactics by Ernst Volckheim, a World War I tank commander and a prolific writer on the subject. He studied the leading European literature on armored warfare and, between 1922 and 1928, wrote five papers for &quot;Military Weekly&quot;, an armed forces journal. While the topics covered were mundane, Guderian related them to why Germany had lost World War I, a controversial subject at the time, and thus raised his profile in the military. There were some trial maneuvers conducted in the Soviet Union and Guderian academically evaluated the results. Britain was experimenting with armoured units under General Percy Hobart, and Guderian kept abreast of Hobart&#x27;s writings. In 1924, he was appointed as an instructor and military historian at Stettin. As a lecturer he was polarizing; some of his pupils enjoyed his wit, but he alienated others with his biting sarcasm.

In 1927, Guderian was promoted to major and in October he was posted to the transport section of the Truppenamt, a clandestine form of the army&#x27;s General Staff, which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. By the autumn of 1928, he was a leading speaker on tanks; however, he did not set foot in one until the summer of 1929, when he briefly drove a Swedish Stridsvagn m/21-29. In October, 1928 he was transferred to the Motor Transport Instruction Staff to teach. In 1931, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and became chief of staff to the Inspectorate of Motorized Troops under Oswald Lutz. This placed Guderian at the center of Germany&#x27;s development of mobile warfare and armored forces.

===Panzer Division and mobile warfare===

In the 1930s, Guderian played a significant role in the development of both the panzer division concept and a doctrine of mechanized offensive warfare that would later become known as blitzkrieg. Guderian&#x27;s 3rd Motor Transport Battalion became the blueprint for the future German armored force. However, his role was less central than he claimed in his memoirs and that historians repeated in the postwar era.

Guderian and his immediate superior Lutz had a symbiotic relationship. Both men worked tirelessly with the shared aim of creating a panzer force. Guderian was the public face advocating mechanized warfare and Lutz worked behind the scenes. Guderian reached into the Nazi regime to promote the panzer force concept, attract support and secure resources. This included a demonstration of the concept to Hitler himself. Lutz persuaded, cajoled and compensated for Guderian&#x27;s often arrogant and argumentative behavior towards his peers. The modern historian Pier Battistelli writes that it is difficult to determine exactly who developed each of the ideas behind the panzer force. Many other officers, such as Walther Nehring and Hermann Breith, were also involved. However, Guderian is widely accepted as having pioneered the communications system developed for the panzer units. The central tenets of blitzkriegindependence, mass and surprisewere first published in doctrinal statements of mechanized warfare by Lutz.

During the autumn of 1936, Lutz asked Guderian to write &quot;Achtung – Panzer!&quot; He requested a polemical tone that promoted the Mobile Troops Command and strategic mechanized warfare. In the resulting work, Guderian mixed academic lectures, a review of military history and armored warfare theory that partly relied on a 1934 book on the subject by Ludwig von Eimannsberger. While limited, the book was in many respects a success. It contained two important questions which would require answering if the army was to be mechanized: how will the army be supplied with fuel, spares and replacement vehicles; and how to move large mechanized forces, especially those that are road-bound? He answered his own questions in discussions of three broad areas: refueling; spare parts; and access to roads.

In 1938, Hitler purged the army of personnel who were unsympathetic to the Nazi regime. Lutz was dismissed and replaced by Guderian. In the spring of that year, Guderian had his first experience of commanding a panzer force during the annexation of Austria. The mobilization was chaotic: tanks ran out of fuel or broke down and the combat value of the formation was non-existent. Had there been any real fighting Guderian would certainly have lost. He stood beside the Führer in Linz as Hitler addressed Germany and Austria in celebration. Afterwards, he set about remedying the problems that the panzer force had encountered. In the last year before the outbreak of World War II, Guderian fostered a closer relationship with Hitler. He attended opera with the Führer and received invitations to dinner. When Neville Chamberlain, in his policy of appeasement, gave Hitler the Sudetenland, it was occupied by Guderian&#x27;s XVI Motorized Corps.

==Second World War==
===Invasion of Poland===

During August, 1939 Guderian took command of the newly formed XIX Army Corps. At short notice he was ordered to spearhead the northern element of the invasion of Poland which began on 1 September. Under his corps command was one of Germany&#x27;s six panzer divisions; Guderian&#x27;s corps controlled 14.5 per cent of Germany&#x27;s armoured fighting vehicles. His task was to advance through the former West Prussian territory (which included his birthplace of Kulm), then travel through East Prussia before heading south towards Warsaw. Guderian used the German concept of &quot;leading forward&quot;, which required commanders to move to the battlefront and assess the situation. He made use of modern communication systems by travelling in a radio-equipped command vehicle with which he kept himself in contact with corps command.

By 5 September, XIX Corps had linked up with forces advancing west from East Prussia. Guderian had accomplished his first operational victory and he gave a tour of the battlefield to Hitler and Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS. The next day, he shifted his corps across East Prussia to participate in the advance on Warsaw. On 9 September his corps was reinforced by 10 Panzer Division and he continued deeper into Poland, finishing at Brest-Litovsk. In ten days Guderian&#x27;s XIX Corps advanced , at times against strong resistance. The tank had proven itself to be a powerful weapon, with only 8 destroyed out of 350 employed. On 16 September, Guderian launched an attack on Brest Litovsk; the next day the Soviet Union invaded Poland. He issued an ultimatum to the city—surrender to the Germans or Sovietsthe garrison capitulated to the Germans. The Soviet Union&#x27;s entry into the war shattered Polish morale and Polish forces began to surrender en masse to Guderian&#x27;s troops. At the conclusion of the campaign, Guderian was awarded a Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross.

The historian Russell Hart writes that Guderian supported the invasion because he &quot;despised the Catholic, Slavic Poles who now occupied parts of his native, beloved Prussia&quot;. Foremost in his mind was the &quot;liberation&quot; of his former family estate at Gross-Klonia; Guderian ordered the advance on Gross-Klonia at night and through fog, leading to what he subsequently admitted were &quot;serious casualties&quot;.

During the invasion, the German military mistreated and killed prisoners of war, ignoring both the Geneva Convention and their own army regulations. Guderian&#x27;s corps withdrew before the SS began its ethnic cleansing campaign. He learned of murder operations and of Jews being forced into Nazi ghettos from his son, Heinz Günther Guderian, who had witnessed some of them. There is no record of him having made any protest.

===Invasion of France and the Low Countries===

Guderian was involved in the strategic debates that preceded the invasion of France and the Low Countries. The plan was being developed by his classmate at the 1907 War Academy, Erich von Manstein. The Manstein Plan shifted the weight of the armoured formations away from a head-on attack through the Low Countries to one through the Ardennes. Guderian confidently proclaimed the feasibility of taking armor through the hilly Ardennes Forest and was subsequently told he may have to command the spearhead of the attack himself. He then complained about the lack of resources until he was given seven mechanized divisions with which to accomplish the task. The plan established a force for the penetration of the forest that comprised the largest concentration of German armor to that date: 1,112 out of Germany&#x27;s total of 2,438 tanks.

Guderian&#x27;s corps spearheaded the drive through the Ardennes and over the Meuse River. He led the attack that broke the French lines at the Battle of Sedan. Guderian&#x27;s panzer group led the &quot;race to the sea&quot;, ending with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and French forces trapped at Dunkirk. A British counter-attack at Arras on 21 May slowed down the German advance and allowed the BEF to establish defenses around points of evacuation, while Hitler, conscious of potential reverses and of allowing unsupported armor into urban fighting, issued the order to halt. A general resumption of the attack was ordered on 26 May, but by that time the Allied forces rallied, offering stiff resistance. On 28 May, with his losses mounting, Guderian advised the abandonment of the armoured assault in favor of a traditional artillery-infantry operation. Guderian was then ordered to advance to the Swiss border. The offensive started at the Weygand Line on 9 June and finished on 17 June with the encirclement of the Maginot Line defences and the remaining French forces.

Despite the success of the invasion, French defeat was not inevitable; the French had better, more numerous military equipment and were not overwhelmed by a numerically or technologically superior military force. Instead, the French loss stemmed from poor army morale, faulty military strategy and a lack of coordination among Allied troops. Hitler and his generals became overconfident after their historic victory, and came to believe they could defeat the Soviet Union: a country with significantly more natural resources, manpower and industrial capacity.

=== Invasion of the Soviet Union ===

In Guderian&#x27;s 1937 book &quot;Achtung – Panzer!&quot; he wrote that &quot;the time has passed when the Russians had no instinct for technology&quot; and that Germany would have to reckon &quot;with the Eastern Question in a form more serious than ever before in history&quot;. However, during the planning for Operation Barbarossa—the German invasion of the Soviet Union—he had become optimistic about the supposed superiority of German arms. By May, 1941 Guderian had accepted Hitler&#x27;s official position that Operation Barbarossa was a preemptive strike. He had accepted some core elements of National Socialism: the Lebensraum concept of territorial expansion and the destruction of the supposed Judeo-Bolshevik threat.

Guderian&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Group began its offensive on 22 June by crossing the Bug River and advancing towards the Dnieper. The combined forces of 2nd and 3rd Panzer Groups closed the Minsk pocket, taking 300,000 prisoners before attacking towards Smolensk. Guderian was awarded a Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oak Leaves on 17 July 1941. Following the conclusion of the Battle of Smolensk, which ended with the encirclement and destruction of the Soviet 16th, 19th and 20th Armies, General Franz Halder, Chief-of-Staff of the OKH, argued in favor of the all-out drive toward Moscow. Halder had Guderian fly to Führer Headquarters to argue the Army&#x27;s case for continuing the assault against Moscow. Guderian, who had just recently been vehemently opposed to Hitler&#x27;s plan for the drive to the south, unexpectedly sided with the dictator. This abrupt change of heart angered both Halder and Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, commander of Army Group Centre, and turned Guderian into somewhat of a pariah amid Army leaders.

By 15 September, German forces including the 1st and 2nd Panzer Groups had completed the largest encirclement in history: the Battle of Kiev. Owing to the 2nd Panzer Group&#x27;s southward turn during the battle, the Wehrmacht destroyed the entire Southwestern Front east of Kiev, inflicting over 600,000 losses on the Red Army by 26 September. However, the campaign had been costly; the German forces had just half the tanks they had three months earlier. They were bogged down in a war of attrition for which the Wehrmacht was not prepared. Guderian&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Group was in the worst shape; it had just 21 per cent of its tanks in working order. In mid-September, he was ordered to make a drive for Moscow. On 30 September the Battle of Moscow began. On 4 October, the 4th Panzer Division, part of the 2nd Panzer Group, suffered a severe setback at Mtsensk, near Oryol. Guderian demanded an inquiry into the realities of tank warfare on the Eastern Front, eventually suggesting in November to senior German tank designers and manufacturers that the quickest solution was to produce a direct copy of the Soviet T-34 tank.

By November, the attack by the 2nd Panzer Group on Tula and Kashira, south of Moscow, achieved limited success, while Guderian vacillated between despair and optimism, depending on the situation at the front. Facing pressure from the German High Command, Field Marshal Günther von Kluge finally committed the weaker south flank of his 4th Army to the attack on 1 December. In the aftermath of the battle, Guderian blamed slow commitment of 4th Army to the attack for the German failure to reach Moscow. This assessment grossly overestimated the capabilities of Kluge&#x27;s remaining forces. It also failed to appreciate the reality that Moscow was a metropolis that German forces lacked the numbers to either encircle or to capture in a frontal assault. In the aftermath of the German failure, Guderian refused to pass on Hitler&#x27;s &#x27;stand fast&#x27; order and fell out with Kluge, the new commander of the Army Group Centre. Guderian was relieved of command on 25 December.

The German formations on the Eastern Front ubiquitously implemented the criminal Commissar Order and the Barbarossa Decree. For all divisions within Guderian&#x27;s panzer group where files are preserved, there is evidence of illegal reprisals against the civilian population. In his memoirs, Guderian denied having given the Commissar Order. However, General Joachim Lemelsen, a corps commander within Guderian&#x27;s panzer group, is documented as saying &quot;prisoners, who could be shown to have been commissars, had to be immediately taken aside and shot&quot;and that the order came directly from Guderian. Reporting to the OKW, Guderian is documented as saying his panzer group had &quot;shunted off&quot; 170 commissars by the beginning of August.

===Inspector General of Armoured Troops===
On 1 March 1943, after the German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, Hitler appointed Guderian to the newly created position of Inspector General of Armoured Troops. The latter had successfully lobbied to be reinstated, resulting in the new posting. Guderian&#x27;s responsibilities were to oversee the panzer arm and the training of Germany&#x27;s panzer forces. He established a collaborative relationship with Albert Speer regarding the manufacture and development of armored fighting vehicles. The military failures of 1943 prevented Guderian from restoring combat power to the armored forces to any significant degree. He had limited success with improved tank destroyers and fixing flaws in the third generation of tanks, the Panther and the Tiger.

Operation Citadel, the last major German offensive operation in the east, was an attempt by the German army to regain the initiative. Guderian opposed the offensive, on the grounds that a victory would be extremely costly and would achieve little, saying &quot;it is a matter of profound indifference to the world whether we hold Kursk or not&quot;.
 In a conversation with Hitler prior to the offensive, Guderian said: &quot;Why are we attacking in the east at all this year?&quot; Hitler responded, &quot;You are right. Whenever I think of this attack, my stomach turns over.&quot; Guderian concluded, &quot;Then you have the right attitude towards this situation. Leave it alone.&quot;

===Acting Chief of Army General Staff===
Guderian became the Acting Chief of the General Staff of the Army High Command with the responsibility of advising Hitler on the Eastern Front. He replaced General of the Infantry Kurt Zeitzler, who had abandoned the position on 1 July after losing faith in Hitler&#x27;s judgement and suffering a nervous breakdown.

Germany was already heading to inevitable defeat, and Guderian could not shape the military situation nor Hitler&#x27;s strategic decisions. Hitler placed Guderian in charge of the &quot;Honour Court&quot;: a kangaroo court for those accused of involvement in the 20 July Plot. Guderian himself denied any involvement with the plot; nevertheless, he had unexpectedly retired to his estate on the day of the assassination attempt. The court discharged those found guilty of participating in the plot from the armed forces so that they could be tried by the People&#x27;s Court, set up for the purpose of prosecuting the alleged plotters. Those accused were tortured by the Gestapo and executed by hanging. Some plotters were hanged by a thin hemp rope, by Hitler&#x27;s direct orders, so that they slowly strangled to death after a lengthy agony. 

Post-war, Guderian claimed that he had attempted to get out of this duty and that he had found the sessions &quot;repulsive&quot;. In reality, Guderian had applied himself to the task with the vigour of a Nazi adherent, which perhaps was due to the desire to deflect attention from himself. Hart writes that he fought to save Rommel&#x27;s chief of staff, Hans Speidel, because Speidel could have implicated Guderian in the plot.

As head of the OKH, Guderian was faced with the pressing issues of the staff work being impacted by arrests, which among the OKH staff and their families eventually ran into the hundreds. Guderian had to fill serious gaps, such as one created by the suicide of General Eduard Wagner, the quartermaster general, in July. Even with vacancies filling up, a key problem remained: too many of the personnel were new to their roles and lacked institutional knowledge, including Guderian himself. Guderian relied heavily on Colonel Johann von Kielmansegg who was the most senior staff officer with experience at the OKH, but he was himself arrested in August. The situation was not improved by Guderian&#x27;s long-standing bias against the General Staff which he blamed for having allegedly opposed his attempts to introduce modern armored doctrine into the army back in the 1930s. The latter months of 1944 were marked by the ever-increasing strife between the OKH and the OKW (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht), as the two organizations competed for resources, especially in the run-up to the last-ditch German December, 1944 offensive on the Western Front. After the war, Guderian blamed Hitler for frittering away the last German reserves in the operation; nonetheless, Germany&#x27;s strategic situation was such that even twenty or thirty extra divisions would not have helped.Guderian completed the total Nazification of the army general staff with a 29 July order that demanded that all officers join the party. He also made the Nazi salute obligatory throughout the armed forces. He supported the politicization of the military, but failed to see why other officers perceived him as a Nazi. As chief-of-staff of the OKH, Guderian did not object to the orders that Hitler and Himmler issued during the brutal suppression of the Warsaw Uprising nor the atrocities being perpetrated against the civilian population of the city. At a Volkssturm rally in November, 1944, Guderian said that there were &quot;95 million National Socialists who stand behind Adolf Hitler&quot;.

After the war, Guderian claimed that his actions in the final months as head of the OKH were driven by a search for a solution to Germany&#x27;s increasingly-bleak prospects. This was supposedly the rationale behind Guderian&#x27;s plans to turn major urban centers along the Eastern Front into so-called fortress cities (&quot;feste Plätze&quot;). This fantastical plan had no hope of succeeding against the mobile operations of the Red Army. In any event, most of the &quot;fortresses&quot; were poorly provisioned and staffed by older garrison troops. On 28 March, following the failed operation to retake the town of Küstrin (now Kostrzyn nad Odrą in Poland), Guderian was sent on leave. He was replaced by General Hans Krebs.

Guderian cultivated close personal relationships with the most powerful people in the regime. He had an exclusive dinner with Himmler on Christmas Day, 1944. On 6 March 1945, shortly before the end of the war, Guderian participated in a propaganda broadcast that denied the Holocaust; the Red Army in its advance had just liberated several extermination camps. Despite the general&#x27;s later claims of being anti-Nazi, Hitler most likely found Guderian&#x27;s values to be closely aligned with Nazi ideology. Hitler brought him out of retirement in 1943 and especially appreciated the orders he issued in the aftermath of the failed plot.

==Later life and death==

Guderian and his staff surrendered to US forces on 10 May 1945. He avoided being convicted as a war criminal at the Nuremberg Trials because there was no substantial documentary evidence against him at that time. He answered questions from the Allied forces and denied being an ardent supporter of Nazism. He joined the US Army Historical Division in 1945 and the US refused requests from the Soviet Union to have him extradited. Even after the war, Guderian retained an affinity with Hitler and National Socialism. While interned by the Americans, his conversations were secretly taped. In one such recording, while conversing with former Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb and former General Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg, Guderian opined: &quot;The fundamental principles [of Nazism] were fine&quot;.

Guderian was released from internment in 1948. Many of his peers were ill-fated. Von Manstein was sentenced to 18 years and Albert Kesselring was given a life sentence. Guderian had informed on his ex-colleagues and co-operated with the Allies, which had helped him evade prosecution. He retired to Schwangau near Füssen in Southern Bavaria and began writing. His most successful book was &quot;Panzer Leader&quot;. He remained an ardent German nationalist for the rest of his life. Guderian died on 14 May 1954 at the age of 65 and is buried at the &quot;Friedhof Hildesheimer Straße&quot; in Goslar.

After the Second World War, the Central Intelligence Agency was highly interested in using Guderian to rally the German right to the Atlanticist cause.

==Writings and mythology==
===&quot;Panzer Leader&quot; myth===
Guderian&#x27;s post-war autobiography &quot;Panzer Leader&quot; was a success with the reading public. He cast himself as an innovator and the &quot;father&quot; of the German panzer arm, both before the war and during the blitzkrieg years. This allowed him to re-imagine himself as the master of the blitzkrieg between 1939 and 1941; however, this was an exaggeration. Guderian&#x27;s German memoirs were first published in 1950. At that time they were the only source on the development of panzer forces, German military records having been misplaced or lost. Consequently, historians based their interpretation of historical events upon Guderian&#x27;s self-centred autobiography. Subsequent biographers supported the myth and embellished it. In 1952 Guderian&#x27;s memoirs were reprinted in English. British journalist and military theorist B. H. Liddell Hart gained access to a group of German generals, imprisoned in the No. 1 POW camp in Grizedale Hall in the north of England from 9 August 1945, as a Political Intelligence Department lecturer taking part in the Re-education programme, in an effort to use that to re-establish his reputation as a military theorist and commentator. He asked Guderian to say that he had based his military theories on Liddell Hart&#x27;s; Guderian obliged. Liddell Hart, in turn, became an advocate for West German rearmament.

In newer studies, historians began to question Guderian&#x27;s memoirs and criticize the myth that they had created. Battistelli, examining Guderian&#x27;s record, said he was not the father of the panzer arm. He was one of a number of innovators. He stood out from his arguably more able compatriot, Lutz, for two reasons. Firstly, he sought the limelight, and secondly, he fostered a close relationship with Hitler. In portraying himself as the father of blitzkrieg and ingratiating himself with the Americans, he avoided being handed over to the Soviet Union. Battistelli writes that his most remarkable skill was not as a theoretician or commander, it was as an author. His books &quot;Achtung-Panzer!&quot; and &quot;Panzer Leader&quot; were a critical and commercial success upon publication and continue to be discussed, researched and analysed many years after his death.

Guderian was a capable tactician and technician, leading his troops successfully in the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France and during the early stages of the invasion of the Soviet Union: especially in the advance to Smolensk and the Battle of Kiev. Liddell Hart writes that most of his success came from positions of substantial advantage, and he was never able to accomplish victory from a position of weakness. Hart suggests that his strengths were outweighed by his deficiencies, such as deliberately creating animosity between his panzer force and the other military arms, with disastrous consequences. His memoirs omitted mention of his military failings and his close relationship with Hitler. James Corum writes in his book &quot;The Roots of Blitzkrieg: Hans von Seeckt and German Military Reform&quot; that Guderian was an excellent general, a first-rate tactician and a man who played a central role in developing Panzer divisions, irrespective of his memoirs.

===Myth of the clean Wehrmacht===
Freelance historian Pier Battistelli argues that Guderian rewrote history in his memoirs, but notes that the biggest re-writing of history comes not in his putative fathering of the panzer force but in the cover-up of his culpability for war crimes during Operation Barbarossa. Units under his command carried out the Commissar Order, which entailed the murder of Red Army political officers. He also played a large role in the commission of reprisals after the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.

Like other generals, Guderian&#x27;s memoirs emphasized his loyalty to Germany and the German people; however, he neglected to mention that Hitler bought this loyalty with bribes, including landed estates and a monthly payment of . Guderian wrote in his memoirs that he had been given a Polish estate as a retirement gift. Worth , the estate covered an area of and it was located at Deipenhof (now Głębokie, Poland) in the Warthegau area of occupied Poland. The occupants had been evicted. Guderian also did not mention that he had initially requested an estate three times larger, but he was turned down by the local Gauleiter, with support from Himmler. The Gauleiter balked at giving such an opulent estate to someone with the rank of only a Colonel-General. Guderian furnished the estate with property stolen by M-Aktion from the homes of French Jews. 

In 1950, Guderian published a pamphlet entitled &quot;Can Europe Be Defended?&quot;, where he lamented that the Western powers had picked the wrong side to ally themselves with during the war, even as Germany &quot;was fighting for its naked existence&quot;, as a &quot;defender of Europe&quot; against the supposed Bolshevik menace. Guderian issued apologetics for Hitler, writing: &quot;For one may judge Hitler&#x27;s acts as one will, in retrospect his struggle was about Europe, even if he made dreadful mistakes and errors&quot;. He claimed that only the Nazi civilian administration (not the Wehrmacht) was responsible for atrocities against Soviet civilians, and scapegoated Hitler and the Russian winter for the Wehrmacht&#x27;s military reverses, as he later did in &quot;Panzer Leader&quot;; in addition, he wrote that six million Germans died during their expulsion from the Eastern territories by the Soviet Union and its allies, while also writing that the defendants executed at the Nuremberg trials (for war crimes such as the Holocaust) were &quot;defenders of Europe&quot;.

Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies, in their book &quot;The Myth of the Eastern Front&quot;, conclude that Guderian&#x27;s memoirs are full of &quot;egregious untruths, half truths, and omissions&quot;, as well as outright &quot;nonsense&quot;. Guderian claimed, contrary to historical evidence, that the criminal Commissar Order was not carried out by his troops because it &quot;never reached [his] panzer group&quot;. He also lied about the Barbarossa Decree that preemptively exempted German troops from prosecution for crimes committed against Soviet civilians, claiming that it was never carried out either. Guderian claimed to have been solicitous towards the civilian population, that he took pains to preserve Russian cultural objects and that his troops had &quot;liberated&quot; Soviet citizens.

David Stahel writes that English-speaking historians too readily presented a distorted image of German generals in the post-war era. In his book &quot;Operation Barbarossa and Germany&#x27;s Defeat in the East&quot;, Stahel wrote: &quot;The men in control of Hitler&#x27;s armies were not honourable men, carrying out their orders as dutiful servants of the state. With resolute support for the regime, the generals unquestioningly waged one war of aggression after the other, and, once Barbarossa began, willingly partook in the genocide of the Nazi regime&quot;.

===In popular culture===
Guderian&#x27;s memoirs remain popular. The favourable descriptions started with the British journalist and military theorist B.H. Liddell Hart, who described Guderian as one of the &quot;Great Captains of History&quot; in a book published by the mass-market Ballantine Books in 1957. As late as 2002, for the 55th anniversary of the first publication of the book, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and other outlets published positive reviews, reinforcing the tenets of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht. The reviews stressed the separation between the professional soldiers and the Nazi regime, while &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; described the book as one of the best written by former German generals. Kenneth Macksey in his biography eulogized Guderian, inflating his true accomplishments.

In 1976, the leading wargaming magazine, &quot;Strategy and Tactics&quot;, spotlighted Guderian in a featured game of the month called &quot;Panzergruppe Guderian&quot;. The magazine cover included a photo of Guderian in military dress, with his Knight&#x27;s Cross and a pair of binoculars, suggesting a commanding role. The magazine featured a glowing profile of Guderian in which he was identified as the originator of blitzkrieg and lauded for his military achievements. Adhering to the postwar myths, the profile posited that a commander like this could &quot;function in any political climate and be unaffected by it&quot;. Guderian thus came across as a consummate professional who stood apart from the crimes of the Nazi regime.

<text>Westmorland (, formerly also spelt &quot;Westmoreland&quot;) is an area of North West England which was historically a county. People of the area are known as Westmerians. The area includes part of the Lake District and the southern Vale of Eden.

The county had an administrative function from the 12th century until 1974, when it was subsumed into Cumbria together with Cumberland, the Sedbergh area of Yorkshire, and the Furness area of Lancashire. It gives its name to the Westmorland and Furness unitary authority area, which covers a larger area than the historic county.

==Early history==
===Background===
At the beginning of the 10th century a large part of modern day Cumbria was part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, and was known as &quot;Scottish Cumberland&quot;.
The Rere Cross was ordered by Edmund I (r.939–946) to serve as a boundary marker between England and Scotland (&quot;Scottish Cumberland&quot;). 
===County of Westmorland===
At the time of Domesday Book in 1086, the county did not exist; half was considered to form part of Yorkshire and the other half part of Scotland. Before 1226, the Barony of Kendal was part of the Honour of Lancaster while the Barony of Westmorland was part of the Earldom of Carlisle, the latter became Cumberland and was part of Scotland at times.

Both baronies became a single county of Westmorland in 1226/7. Neighbouring Lancashire was also formed at this time. Appleby was the historic county town, having been chartered in 1179. It was a parliamentary borough from 1295-1832, and incorporated by letters patent in 1574.

===Geography===
Westmorland bordered Cumberland to the north, County Durham and Yorkshire to the east, and Lancashire to the south and west. Windermere formed part of the western border with Lancashire north of the sands, and Ullswater part of the border with Cumberland. The highest point of the county is Helvellyn, at . According to the 1831 census the county covered an area of .

====Division into wards====
Westmorland was subdivided into the two baronies of Westmorland (or sometimes Appleby) and Kendal. As with Cumberland, Durham and Northumberland it was divided into wards. The baronies were each further subdivided into two wards:

*Westmorland
**East ward – Appleby, Brough, Kirkby Stephen, Orton, Tebay
**West ward – Askham, Bampton, Barton, Patterdale, Shap, Yanwath
*Kendal
**Kendal ward – Ambleside, Burton-in-Kendal, Grasmere, Grayrigg, Kentmere, Kendal, Windermere
**Lonsdale ward – Kirkby Lonsdale

==Modern history==
In 1889, under the Local Government Act 1888, a county council was created for Westmorland, taking functions from the quarter sessions. The county council was based at the County Hall in Kendal, although the assizes were held in the Shire Hall in the historic county town of Appleby. Kendal had been chartered as a municipal borough in 1835, Appleby in 1885. The county had no county boroughs throughout its history, so the administrative county, the area under the control of the county council, was coterminous with the geographic county.

Aside from the two municipal boroughs of Kendal and Appleby, the Local Government Act 1894 divided the county into urban districts and rural districts:
*Five urban districts: Ambleside, Bowness on Windermere, Grasmere, Kirkby Lonsdale, Windermere
*Three rural districts: West Ward, East Westmorland, South Westmorland
In 1905, a new Shap urban district was formed, while Windermere absorbed the neighbouring Bowness UD.

A County Review Order in 1935 reduced the number of districts in the county: 
*A new Lakes Urban District was formed by the merger of Ambleside and Grasmere UDs and adjacent parishes in West Ward and South Westmorland RDs
*East Westmorland RD, most of West Ward RD and Shap UD were merged to form North Westmorland Rural District
*South Westmorland RD absorbed Kirkby Lonsdale UD, at the same time losing an area to Lakes UD.

Despite their title, many of Westmorland&#x27;s urban districts, such as Lakes, Grasmere, and Shap, were quite rural in character.
According to the 1971 census, Westmorland was the second least populated administrative county in England, after Rutland. The distribution of population was as follows:

In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the county council was abolished and its former area was combined with Cumberland and parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire to form the new county of Cumbria, administered by a new Cumbria County Council. The area formed parts of the districts of South Lakeland and Eden from 1974 to 2023.

In July 2021, Robert Jenrick, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government announced the dissolution of Cumbria County Council and its six district councils and their replacement in April 2023 by two unitary authorities: Cumberland, and Westmorland and Furness. The latter re-united and re-established historic Westmorland within a single administrative unit, along with the Furness (Lancs), Penrith (Cumberland) and Sedbergh (Yorks) areas.

== Toponymy ==
J. E. Marr explains the name &quot;Westmorland&quot; thus:
The name applied to the district by the Anglo-Saxons was originally Westmoringaland, &#x27;the land of the people of the western moors,&#x27; in distinction from that of the people of the eastern moors, on the east side of the Pennine chain. The present name has not, however, been derived from that of Westmoringaland, but from Westmarieland or Westmerieland, used in the twelfth century, hence Westmerland. The meaning of this is land of the western &quot;meres&quot;, and not &quot;moors&quot;. Mere means boundary as well as a lake, and it is doubtful whether the word as used here refers to lakes or boundaries. There is no doubt that Westmerland is the more correct spelling [...].
==Coat of arms==
The College of Arms granted Westmorland County Council a coat of arms in 1926. The design of the shield referred to the two components of the county: on two red bars (from the arms of the de Lancaster family, Barons of Kendal) was placed a gold apple tree (from the seal of the borough of Appleby, for the Barony of Westmorland). The crest above the shield was the head of a ram of the local Herdwick breed. On the ram&#x27;s forehead was a shearman&#x27;s hook, a tool used in the handling of wool. The hook was part of the insignia of the borough of Kendal, the administrative centre of the county council.

==Legacy==

in April 2023, Westmorland reappeared on national maps as part of Westmorland and Furness unitary authority. During the intervening 1974-2023 period, Westmorland has still been used as a place name by organisations and businesses in the area such as:
*&quot;The Westmorland Gazette&quot; (founded 1818)
*The Westmorland County Agricultural Society (founded 1799), which organises the annual Westmorland County Agricultural Society Show
*The Westmorland County Football Association, the regional division of the Football Association that administers many football leagues including the Westmorland Association Football League.
*The Westmorland Geological Society (formed 1973)
*The Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society (founded 1866)
*The Westmorland Youth Orchestra
*The Westmorland Shopping Centre, Kendal
*The Westmorland Cricket League
*Westmorland Motorway Services, the company behind Tebay services in Westmorland and Gloucester Services.
*In 1974 the successor parish council formed for the former borough of Appleby adopted the name Appleby-in-Westmorland.
*Westmorland General Hospital in Kendal
*Westmorland croquet club

Most of the historic county lies within the Westmorland and Lonsdale parliamentary constituency.

In June 1994, during the 1990s UK local government reform, the Local Government Commission published draft recommendations suggesting that Westmorland&#x27;s border with Yorkshire and Lancashire be restored for ceremonial purposes. The final recommendations, published in October 1994, did not include such recommendations, apparently due to lack of expression of support for the proposal to the commission.

In September 2011, the Westmorland Association, a local society which promotes the county&#x27;s identity, successfully registered the Flag of Westmorland with the Flag Institute.

In 2013, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, formally recognised and acknowledged the continued existence of England&#x27;s 39 historic counties, including Westmorland.

In April 2023, local government in Cumbria was reorganised into two unitary authority areas, one of which is named Westmorland and Furness and covers all of the historic county along with parts of historic Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumberland.

<text>Thomas Adams (10 September 1871 – 24 March 1940) was a British architect who was a pioneer of urban planning in the UK and Canada. 

==Life and career==
Born on Meadowhouse Farm near Edinburgh to dairy farmers James and Margaret Adams, he was educated at Daniel Stewart&#x27;s College in Edinburgh and was a farmer in his early years. Adams moved to London where he worked as a journalist. He served as secretary to the Garden City Association and was the first manager of Letchworth, England, from 1903 to 1906.

Adams became a designer of low-density residential developments that were commonly referred to as &quot;garden suburbs.&quot; In 1909–1914, Adams worked as Town Planning Adviser to the Local Government Board. In 1914, he was invited to Canada to work for the Commission of Conservation to provide better housing for the growing population of industrial cities. After the Halifax Explosion in 1917, Adams designed the Hydrostone section using Garden City principles. In the same year he published &quot;,&quot; one of the earliest books to advocate the use of land use controls. He also designed a portion of Corner Brook, Newfoundland. He worked with Halifax architect Andrew R. Cobb on this project. On other projects in Quebec and Nova Scotia he partnered with Ross and Macdonald of Montreal. He was later responsible for surveys and a plan for New York City. From 1923 to 1930 he was a director of the Regional Plan of New York. The plan was published in 1929 and anticipated the region&#x27;s basic transportation and infrastructure needs for the next 30 years.

On returning to the United Kingdom, Thomas Adams became one of the early presidents of the Institute of Landscape Architects (ILA) which became the Landscape Institute. In 1932, he was asked by Massachusetts Institute of Technology architect William Emerson to design a city planning curriculum for the university. His son, Frederick Adams, was nominated by Emerson to be the first department head of City Planning at the MIT and was named a &quot;Pioneer Planner&quot; by the American Institute of Certified Planners. Towards the end of his life, Adams served as a visiting lecturer in his son&#x27;s new department. He took an active role in creating planning institutions in Great Britain, Canada and the United States. In Canada, Adams is recognized as a National Historic Person.

<doc id="184399" wikidata="Q502073" url="?curid=184399" title="Halifax Explosion">
<text>On the morning of 6 December 1917, the French cargo ship collided with the Norwegian vessel in the harbour of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot;, laden with high explosives, caught fire and exploded, devastating the Richmond district of Halifax. At least 1,782 people were killed, largely in Halifax and Dartmouth, by the blast, debris, fires, or collapsed buildings, and an estimated 9,000 others were injured. The blast was the largest human-made explosion at the time. It released the equivalent energy of roughly .

&quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; was under orders from the French government to carry her cargo from New York City via Halifax to Bordeaux, France. At roughly 8:45 am, she collided at low speed, approximately one knot (), with the unladen &quot;Imo&quot;, chartered by the Commission for Relief in Belgium to pick up a cargo of relief supplies in New York. On &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot;, the impact damaged benzol barrels stored on deck, causing them to leak vapours which were ignited by sparks from the collision, setting off a fire on board that quickly grew out of control. Approximately 20 minutes later at 9:04:35 am, &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; exploded.

Nearly all structures within an 800-metre (half-mile) radius, including the community of Richmond, were obliterated. A pressure wave snapped trees, bent iron rails, demolished buildings, grounded vessels (including &quot;Imo&quot;, which was washed ashore by the ensuing tsunami), and scattered fragments of &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; for kilometres. Across the harbour, in Dartmouth, there was also widespread damage. A tsunami created by the blast wiped out a community of Mi&#x27;kmaq who had lived in the Tufts Cove area for generations.

Relief efforts began almost immediately, and hospitals quickly became full. Rescue trains began arriving the day of the explosion from across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick while other trains from central Canada and the Northeastern United States were impeded by blizzards. Construction of temporary shelters to house the many people left homeless began soon after the disaster. The initial judicial inquiry found &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; to have been responsible for the disaster, but a later appeal determined that both vessels were to blame. The North End of Halifax has several memorials to the victims of the explosion.

==Background==
Dartmouth lies on the east shore of Halifax Harbour, and Halifax is on the west shore. By 1917, &quot;Halifax&#x27;s inner harbour had become a principal assembly point for merchant convoys leaving for Britain and France.&quot; Halifax and Dartmouth had thrived during times of war; the harbour was one of the British Royal Navy&#x27;s most important bases in North America, a centre for wartime trade, and a home to privateers who harried the British Empire&#x27;s enemies during the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and the War of 1812.

The completion of the Intercolonial Railway and its Deep Water Terminal in 1880 allowed for increased steamship trade and led to accelerated development of the port area, but Halifax faced an economic downturn in the 1890s as local factories struggled to compete with businesses in central Canada. The British garrison left the city in late 1905 and early 1906. The Canadian government took over the Halifax Dockyard (now CFB Halifax) from the Royal Navy. This dockyard later became the command centre of the Royal Canadian Navy upon its founding in 1910.

Just before the First World War, the Canadian government began a determined, costly effort to develop the harbour and waterfront facilities. The outbreak of the war brought Halifax back to prominence. As the Royal Canadian Navy had virtually no seaworthy ships of its own, the Royal Navy assumed responsibility for maintaining Atlantic trade routes by re-adopting Halifax as its North American base of operations. In 1915, management of the harbour fell under the control of the Royal Canadian Navy; by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in Halifax, including patrol ships, tugboats, and minesweepers.

The population of Halifax/Dartmouth had increased to between 60,000 and 65,000 people by 1917. Convoys carried men, animals, and supplies to the European theatre of war. The two main points of departure were in Nova Scotia at Sydney, on Cape Breton Island, and Halifax. Hospital ships brought the wounded to the city, so a new military hospital was constructed.

The success of German U-boat attacks on ships crossing the Atlantic Ocean led the Allies to institute a convoy system to reduce losses while transporting goods and soldiers to Europe. Merchant ships gathered at Bedford Basin on the northwestern end of the harbour, which was protected by two sets of anti-submarine nets and guarded by patrol ships of the Royal Canadian Navy.

The convoys departed under the protection of British cruisers and destroyers. A large army garrison protected the city with forts, gun batteries, and anti-submarine nets. These factors drove a major military, industrial, and residential expansion of the city, and the weight of goods passing through the harbour increased nearly ninefold. All neutral ships bound for ports in North America were required to report to Halifax for inspection.

==Disaster==

The Norwegian ship had sailed from the Netherlands en route to New York to take on relief supplies for Belgium, under the command of Haakon From. The ship arrived in Halifax on 3 December for neutral inspection and spent two days in Bedford Basin awaiting refuelling supplies. Though she had been given clearance to leave the port on 5 December, &quot;Imo&quot;″s departure was delayed because her coal load did not arrive until late that afternoon. The loading of fuel was not completed until after the anti-submarine nets had been raised for the night. Therefore, the vessel could not depart until the next morning.

The French cargo ship arrived from New York late on 5 December, under the command of Aimé Le Medec. The vessel was fully loaded with the explosives TNT and picric acid, the highly flammable fuel benzol and guncotton. She intended to join a slow convoy gathering in Bedford Basin readying to depart for Europe but was too late to enter the harbour before the nets were raised. Ships carrying dangerous cargo were not allowed into the harbour before the war, but the risks posed by German submarines had resulted in a relaxation of regulations.

Navigating into or out of Bedford Basin required passage through a strait called the Narrows. Ships were expected to keep close to the side of the channel situated on their starboard (&quot;right&quot;), and pass oncoming vessels &quot;port to port&quot;, that is to keep them on their &quot;left&quot; side. Ships were restricted to a speed of within the harbour.

===Collision and fire===

&quot;Imo&quot; was granted clearance to leave Bedford Basin by signals from the guard ship HMCS &quot;Acadia&quot; at approximately 7:30 on the morning of 6December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour&#x27;s speed limit in an attempt to make up for the delay experienced in loading her coal. &quot;Imo&quot; met American tramp steamer SS &quot;Clara&quot; being piloted up the wrong (western) side of the harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards, &quot;Imo&quot; was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat &quot;Stella Maris&quot;, which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of &quot;Stella Maris&quot;, saw &quot;Imo&quot; approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.

Francis Mackey, an experienced harbour pilot, had boarded &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; on the evening of 5 December 1917; he had asked about &quot;special protections&quot; such as a guard ship, given &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot;″s cargo, but no protections were put in place. &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; started moving at 7:30 am on 6 December and was the second ship to enter the harbour as the anti-submarine net between Georges Island and Pier 21 opened for the morning. &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; headed towards Bedford Basin on the Dartmouth side of the harbour. Mackey kept his eye on the ferry traffic between Halifax and Dartmouth and other small boats in the area. He first spotted &quot;Imo&quot; when she was about away and became concerned as her path appeared to be heading towards his ship&#x27;s starboard side, as if to cut him off. Mackey gave a short blast of his ship&#x27;s signal whistle to indicate that he had the right of way but was met with two short blasts from &quot;Imo&quot;, indicating that the approaching vessel would not yield its position. The captain ordered &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; to halt her engines and angle slightly to starboard, closer to the Dartmouth side of the Narrows. He let out another single blast of his whistle, hoping the other vessel would likewise move to starboard but was again met with a double-blast.

Sailors on nearby ships heard the series of signals and, realizing that a collision was imminent, gathered to watch as &quot;Imo&quot; bore down on &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot;. Both ships had cut their engines by this point, but their momentum carried them towards each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the bow of &quot;Imo&quot; in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when &quot;Imo&quot; suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship&#x27;s height in the water and the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship&#x27;s head to swing into &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot;. &quot;Imo&quot;″s prow pushed into the No. 1 hold of &quot;Mont Blanc&quot;, on her starboard side.

The collision occurred at 8:45 am. The damage to &quot;Mont Blanc&quot; was not severe, but barrels of deck cargo toppled and broke open. This flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As &quot;Imo&quot;″s engines kicked in, she disengaged, which created sparks inside &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot;″s hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly up the side of the ship. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.

Towing two scows at the time of the collision, &quot;Stella Maris&quot; responded immediately to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6 to spray the burning ship with their fire hose. The tug&#x27;s captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized that the fire was too intense for their single hose and backed off from the burning &quot;Mont Blanc&quot;. They were approached by a whaler from HMS &quot;Highflyer&quot; and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS &quot;Niobe&quot;. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of &quot;Niobe&quot; agreed to secure a line to the French ship&#x27;s stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a hawser came down. It was at this point that the blast occurred.

===Explosion===

At 9:04:35 am the out-of-control fire on board &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; set off her cargo of high explosives. The ship was completely blown apart and a powerful blast wave radiated away from the explosion initially at more than per second. Temperatures of and pressures of thousands of atmospheres accompanied the moment of detonation at the centre of the explosion. White-hot shards of iron fell down upon Halifax and Dartmouth.

A cloud of white smoke rose to at least . The blast was felt as far away as Cape Breton () and Prince Edward Island (). An area of over was completely destroyed by the explosion, and the harbour floor was momentarily exposed by the volume of water that was displaced. A tsunami was formed by water surging in to fill the void; it rose as high as above the high-water mark on the Halifax side of the harbour. &quot;Imo&quot; was carried onto the shore at Dartmouth by the tsunami. The blast killed all but one on the whaler, everyone on the pinnace and 21 of the 26 men on &quot;Stella Maris&quot;; she ended up on the Dartmouth shore, severely damaged. The captain&#x27;s son, First Mate Walter Brannen, who had been thrown into the hold by the blast, survived, as did four others. All but one of &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot;&#x27;s crew members survived.

The blast instantly killed more than 1,600 people and injured an additional 9,000, more than 300 of whom later died. It destroyed or badly damaged every building within a radius, over 12,000 in total. Hundreds of people who had been watching the fire from their homes were blinded when the blast wave shattered the windows in front of them. Overturned stoves and lamps started fires throughout Halifax, particularly in the North End, where entire city blocks burned, trapping residents inside their houses. Firefighter Billy Wells, who was thrown away from the explosion and had his clothes torn from his body, described the devastation survivors faced: &quot;The sight was awful, with people hanging out of windows dead. Some with their heads missing, and some thrown onto the overhead telegraph wires.&quot; He was the only member of the eight-man crew of the fire engine &quot;Patricia&quot; to survive.

Large brick and stone factories near Pier 6, such as the Acadia Sugar Refinery, disappeared into unrecognizable heaps of rubble, killing most of their workers. The Nova Scotia cotton mill located 1.5 km (0.93 mile) from the blast was destroyed by fire and the collapse of its concrete floors. The Royal Naval College of Canada building was badly damaged, and several cadets and instructors maimed. The Richmond Railway Yards and station were destroyed, killing 55 railway workers and destroying and damaging over 500 railway cars. The North Street Station, one of the busiest in Canada, was badly damaged.

The death toll could have been worse had it not been for the self-sacrifice of an Intercolonial Railway dispatcher, Patrick Vincent (Vince) Coleman, operating at the railyard about from Pier 6, where the explosion occurred. He and his co-worker, William Lovett, learned of the dangerous cargo aboard the burning &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; from a sailor and began to flee. Coleman remembered that an incoming passenger train from Saint John, New Brunswick, was due to arrive at the railyard within minutes. He returned to his post alone and continued to send out urgent telegraph messages to stop the train. Several variations of the message have been reported, among them this from the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic: &quot;Hold up the train. Ammunition ship afire in harbor making for Pier 6 and will explode. Guess this will be my last message. Good-bye boys.&quot; Coleman&#x27;s message was responsible for bringing all incoming trains around Halifax to a halt. It was heard by other stations all along the Intercolonial Railway, helping railway officials to respond immediately. Passenger Train No. 10, the overnight train from Saint John, is believed to have heeded the warning and stopped a safe distance from the blast at Rockingham, saving the lives of about 300 railway passengers. Coleman was killed at his post.

==Rescue efforts==
First rescue efforts came from surviving neighbours and co-workers who pulled and dug out victims from buildings. The initial informal response was soon joined by surviving policemen, firefighters and military personnel who began to arrive, as did anyone with a working vehicle; cars, trucks and delivery wagons of all kinds were enlisted to collect the wounded. A flood of victims soon began to arrive at the city&#x27;s hospitals, which were quickly overwhelmed. The new military hospital, Camp Hill, admitted approximately 1,400 victims on 6 December.

Firefighters were among the first to respond to the disaster, rushing to &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; to attempt to extinguish the blaze before the explosion even occurred. They also played a role after the blast, with fire companies arriving to assist from across Halifax, and by the end of the day from as far away as Amherst, Nova Scotia, () and Moncton, New Brunswick, () on relief trains. Halifax Fire Department&#x27;s West Street Station 2 was the first to arrive at Pier 6 with the crew of &quot;Patricia&quot;, the first motorized fire engine in Canada. In the final moments before the explosion, hoses were being unrolled as the fire spread to the docks. Nine members of the Halifax Fire Department lost their lives performing their duty that day.

Royal Navy cruisers in port sent some of the first organized rescue parties ashore. HMS &quot;Highflyer&quot;, along with the armed merchant cruisers HMS &quot;Changuinola&quot;, HMS &quot;Knight Templar&quot; and HMS &quot;Calgarian&quot;, sent boats ashore with rescue parties and medical personnel and soon began to take wounded aboard. A US Coast Guard cutter, , also sent a rescue party ashore. Out at sea, the American cruiser USS &quot;Tacoma&quot; and armed merchant cruiser USS &quot;Von Steuben&quot; (formerly SS &quot;Kronprinz Wilhelm&quot;) were passing Halifax en route to the United States. &quot;Tacoma&quot; was rocked so severely by the blast wave that her crew went to general quarters. Spotting the large and rising column of smoke, &quot;Tacoma&quot; altered course and arrived to assist rescue at 2 pm. &quot;Von Steuben&quot; arrived a half-hour later. The American steamship &quot;Old Colony&quot;, docked in Halifax for repairs, suffered little damage and was quickly converted to serve as a hospital ship, staffed by doctors and orderlies from the British and American navy vessels in the harbour.

Dazed survivors immediately feared that the explosion was the result of a bomb dropped from a German plane. Troops at gun batteries and barracks immediately turned out in case the city was under attack, but within an hour switched from defence to rescue roles as the cause and location of the explosion were determined. All available troops were called in from harbour fortifications and barracks to the North End to rescue survivors and provide transport to the city&#x27;s hospitals, including the two army hospitals in the city.

Adding to the chaos were fears of a potential second explosion. A cloud of steam shot out of ventilators at the ammunition magazine at Wellington Barracks as naval personnel extinguished a fire by the magazine. The fire was quickly put out; the cloud was seen from blocks away and quickly led to rumours that another explosion was imminent. Uniformed officers ordered everyone away from the area. As the rumour spread across the city, many families fled their homes. The confusion hampered efforts for over two hours until fears were dispelled by about noon. Many rescuers ignored the evacuation, and naval rescue parties continued working uninterrupted at the harbour.

Surviving railway workers in the railyards at the heart of the disaster carried out rescue work, pulling people from the harbour and from under debris. The overnight train from Saint John was just approaching the city when hit by the blast but was only slightly damaged. It continued into Richmond until the track was blocked by wreckage. Passengers and soldiers aboard used the emergency tools from the train to dig people out of houses and bandaged them with sheets from the sleeping cars. The train was loaded with injured and left the city at 1:30 with a doctor aboard, to evacuate the wounded to Truro.

Led by Lieutenant Governor MacCallum Grant, leading citizens formed the Halifax Relief Commission at around noon. The committee organized members in charge of organizing medical relief for both Halifax and Dartmouth, supplying transportation, food and shelter, and covering medical and funeral costs for victims. The commission would continue until 1976, participating in reconstruction and relief efforts and later distributing pensions to survivors. Men and women turned out to serve as everything from hospital aides to shelter staff, while children contributed to the relief effort by carrying messages from site to site. Community facilities like the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA) were rapidly converted to emergency hospital facilities with medical students providing care.

Rescue trains were dispatched from across Atlantic Canada, as well as the northeastern United States. The first left Truro around 10 am carrying medical personnel and supplies, arrived in Halifax by noon and returned to Truro with the wounded and homeless by 3 pm. The track had become impassable after Rockingham, on the western edge of Bedford Basin. To reach the wounded, rescue personnel had to walk through parts of the devastated city until they reached a point where the military had begun to clear the streets. By nightfall, a dozen trains had reached Halifax from the Nova Scotian towns of Truro, Kentville, Amherst, Stellarton, Pictou, and Sydney and from New Brunswick, including the town of Sackville, and the cities of Moncton and Saint John.

Relief efforts were hampered the following day by a blizzard that blanketed Halifax with of heavy snow. Trains en route from other parts of Canada and from the United States were stalled in snowdrifts, and telegraph lines that had been hastily repaired following the explosion were again knocked down. Halifax was isolated by the storm, and while rescue committees were forced to suspend the search for survivors, the storm also aided efforts to put out fires throughout the city.

==Destruction and loss of life==

The exact number killed by the disaster is unknown. The Halifax Explosion Remembrance Book, an official database of the Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management, identified 1,782 victims. As many as 1,600 people died immediately in the blast, tsunami, and collapse of buildings. The last body, a caretaker killed at the Exhibition Grounds, was not recovered until summer 1919. An additional 9,000 were injured. 1,630 homes were destroyed in the explosion and fires, and another 12,000 damaged; roughly 6,000 people were left homeless and 25,000 had insufficient shelter. The city&#x27;s industrial sector was in large part gone, with many workers among the casualties and the dockyard heavily damaged.

A mortuary committee chaired by Alderman R. B. Coldwell was quickly formed at Halifax City Hall on the morning of the disaster. The Chebucto Road School (now the Maritime Conservatory of Performing Arts) in Halifax&#x27;s west end was chosen as a central morgue. A company of the Royal Canadian Engineers (RCE) repaired and converted the basement of the school to serve as a morgue and classrooms to serve as offices for the Halifax coroner. Trucks and wagons soon began to arrive with bodies. Arthur S. Barnstead took over from Coldwell as the morgue went into operation and implemented a system based on the one his father, John Henry Barnstead, developed to catalogue the dead in the aftermath of the disaster of 1912. Many of the wounds inflicted by the blast were permanently debilitating, such as those caused by flying glass or by the flash of the explosion. Thousands of people had stopped to watch the ship burning in the harbour, many from inside buildings, leaving them directly in the path of glass fragments from shattered windows. According to an article in the &quot;British Journal of Ophthalmology&quot;, ophthalmologists responding to the disaster performed 249 enucleations; 16 people had both eyes removed.

An estimated CA$35 million in damage resulted (CA$ million today). About $30 million in financial aid was raised from various sources, including $18 million from the federal government, over $4 million from the British government, and $750,000 from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

===Dartmouth===
Dartmouth was not as densely populated as Halifax and was separated from the blast by the width of the harbour, but still suffered heavy damage. Almost 100 people were estimated to have died on the Dartmouth side. Windows were shattered and many buildings were damaged or destroyed, including the Oland Brewery and parts of the Starr Manufacturing Company. Nova Scotia Hospital was the only hospital in Dartmouth and many of the victims were treated there.

===Mi&#x27;kmaq settlement===
There were small enclaves of Mi&#x27;kmaq in and around the coves of Bedford Basin on the Dartmouth shore. Directly opposite to Pier 9 on the Halifax side sat a community in Tufts Cove which included the Mi&#x27;kmaq community of Turtle Grove. In the years and months preceding the explosion, the Department of Indian Affairs had been actively trying to force the Mi&#x27;kmaq to give up their land and move to a reserve, but this had not occurred by the time of the explosion. Turtle Grove was close to the centre of the blast and the physical structures of the settlement were obliterated by the explosion and tsunami. A precise Mi&#x27;kmaq death toll is unknown as the Department of Indian Affairs and census records for the community were incomplete. Nine bodies were recovered from Turtle Grove and there were eleven known survivors. The Halifax Remembrance Book lists 16 members of the Tufts Cove Community as dead; not all the dead listed as in Tufts Cove were Indigenous. The Turtle Grove settlement was not rebuilt in the wake of the disaster. Survivors were housed in a racially segregated building under generally poor conditions and most were eventually dispersed around Nova Scotia.

===Africville===
The Black community of Africville, on the southern shores of Bedford Basin adjacent to the Halifax Peninsula, was spared the direct force of the blast by the shadow effect of the raised ground to the south. However, Africville&#x27;s small and frail homes were heavily damaged by the explosion. Families recorded the deaths of five residents. A combination of persistent racism and a growing conviction that Africville should be demolished to make way for industrial development resulted in the people of Africville receiving no police or fire protection; they had to make do without water mains and sewer lines, despite paying city taxes. Africville received little of the donated relief funds and none of the progressive reconstruction invested in other parts of the city after the explosion.

==Investigation==
Many people in Halifax first thought the explosion to be the result of a German attack. The &quot;Halifax Herald&quot; continued to propagate this belief for some time, reporting, for example, that Germans had mocked victims of the explosion. While John Johansen, the Norwegian helmsman of &quot;Imo&quot;, was being treated for serious injuries sustained during the explosion, it was reported to the military police that he had been behaving suspiciously. Johansen was arrested on suspicions of being a German spy when a search turned up a letter on his person, supposedly written in German. It turned out that the letter was actually written in Norwegian. Immediately following the explosion, most of the German survivors in Halifax had been rounded up and imprisoned. Eventually the fear dissipated as the real cause of the explosion became known, although rumours of German involvement persisted.

A judicial inquiry known as the Wreck Commissioner&#x27;s Inquiry was formed to investigate the causes of the collision. Proceedings began at the Halifax Court House on 13 December 1917, presided over by Justice Arthur Drysdale. The inquiry&#x27;s report of 4 February 1918 blamed &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot;″s captain, Aimé Le Médec, the ship&#x27;s pilot, Francis Mackey, and Commander F. Evan Wyatt, the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s chief examining officer in charge of the harbour, gates and anti-submarine defences, for causing the collision. Drysdale agreed with Dominion Wreck Commissioner L. A. Demers&#x27; opinion that &quot;it was the &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot;″s responsibility alone to ensure that she avoided a collision at all costs&quot; given her cargo; he was likely influenced by local opinion, which was strongly anti-French, as well as by the &quot;street fighter&quot; style of argumentation used by &quot;Imo&quot; lawyer Charles Burchell. According to Crown counsel W. A. Henry, this was &quot;a great surprise to most people&quot;, who had expected the &quot;Imo&quot; to be blamed for being on the wrong side of the channel. All three men were charged with manslaughter and criminal negligence at a preliminary hearing heard by Stipendiary Magistrate Richard A. McLeod, and bound over for trial. A Nova Scotia Supreme Court justice, Benjamin Russell, found there was no evidence to support these charges. Mackey was discharged on a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and the charges dropped. Because the pilot and the captain were arrested on the same warrant, the charges against Le Médec were also dismissed. Commander Wyatt, charged on a separate warrant, was the only one of the three who was indicted. On 17 April 1918, a jury acquitted Wyatt in a trial that lasted less than a day.

Drysdale oversaw the first civil litigation trial, in which the owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; entirely at fault. Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; and &quot;Imo&quot; were equally to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever convicted for any crime or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster.

==Reconstruction==

Efforts began shortly after the explosion to clear debris, repair buildings, and establish temporary housing for survivors left homeless by the explosion. By late January 1918, around 5,000 were still without shelter. A reconstruction committee under Colonel Robert Low constructed 832 new housing units, which were furnished by the Massachusetts-Halifax Relief Fund.

Partial train service resumed from a temporary rail terminal in the city&#x27;s South End on 7 December. Full service resumed on 9 December when tracks were cleared and the North Street Station reopened. The Canadian Government Railways created a special unit to clear and repair railway yards as well as rebuild railway piers and the Naval Dockyard. Most piers returned to operation by late December and were repaired by January.

The North End Halifax neighbourhood of Richmond bore the brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city&#x27;s North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density, and multifunctional urban neighbourhood.

The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919, just a few months before Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, visited the site on 17 August, touring many of the houses and hearing stories about the impacts of the tragedy and &quot;of the kindness of the people who quickly came to their aid.&quot; Once finished, the Hydrostone neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses, and parks, which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax. It has now become an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts.

Every building in the Halifax dockyard required some degree of rebuilding, as did HMCS &quot;Niobe&quot; and the docks themselves; all of the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s minesweepers and patrol boats were undamaged. Prime Minister Robert Borden pledged that the government would be &quot;co-operating in every way to reconstruct the Port of Halifax: this was of utmost importance to the Empire&quot;. Captain Symington of USS &quot;Tacoma&quot; speculated that the port would not be operational for months, but a convoy departed on 11 December and dockyard operations resumed before Christmas.

==Legacy==
The Halifax Explosion was one of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions. An extensive comparison of 130 major explosions by Halifax historian Jay White in 1994 concluded that it &quot;remains unchallenged in overall magnitude as long as five criteria are considered together: number of casualties, force of blast, radius of devastation, quantity of explosive material, and total value of property destroyed.&quot; For many years afterward, the Halifax Explosion was the standard by which all large blasts were measured. For instance, in its report on the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, &quot;Time&quot; wrote that the explosive power of the Little Boy bomb was seven times that of the Halifax Explosion.

The many eye injuries resulting from the disaster led to better understanding of how to care for damaged eyes, and &quot;with the recently formed Canadian National Institute for the Blind, Halifax became internationally known as a centre for care for the blind&quot;, according to Dalhousie University professor Victoria Allen. The lack of coordinated pediatric care in such a disaster was noted by William Ladd, a surgeon from Boston who had arrived to help. His insights from the explosion are generally credited with inspiring him to pioneer the specialty of pediatric surgery in North America. The Halifax Explosion inspired a series of health reforms, including around public sanitation and maternity care.
The event was traumatic for the whole surviving community, so the memory was largely suppressed. After the first anniversary, the city stopped commemorating the explosion for decades. The second official commemoration did not take place before the 50th anniversary in 1967, and even after that, the activities stopped again. Construction began in 1964 on the Halifax North Memorial Library, designed to commemorate the victims of the explosion. The library entrance featured the first monument built to mark the explosion, the Halifax Explosion Memorial Sculpture, created by artist Jordi Bonet. The sculpture was dismantled by the Halifax Regional Municipality in 2004.

The Halifax Explosion Memorial Bells were built in 1985, relocating memorial carillon bells from a nearby church to a large concrete sculpture on Fort Needham Hill, facing the &quot;ground zero&quot; area of the explosion. The Bell Tower is the location of an annual civic ceremony every 6 December. A memorial at Halifax Fire Station No. 4 on Lady Hammond Road honours the firefighters killed while responding to the explosion. Fragments of &quot;Mont-Blanc&quot; have been mounted as neighbourhood monuments to the explosion at Albro Lake Road in Dartmouth, at Regatta Point, and elsewhere in the area. Simple monuments mark the mass graves of explosion victims at the Fairview Lawn Cemetery and the Bayers Road Cemetery. A Memorial Book listing the names of all the known victims is displayed at the Halifax North Memorial Library and at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, which has a large permanent exhibit about the Halifax Explosion. Harold Gilman was commissioned to create a painting memorializing the event; his work, &quot;Halifax Harbour at Sunset&quot;, &quot;tells very little about the recent devastation, as the viewpoint is set back so that the harbour appears undisturbed&quot;.

Hugh MacLennan&#x27;s novel &quot;Barometer Rising&quot; (1941) is set in Halifax at the time of the explosion and includes a carefully researched description of its impact on the city. Following in MacLennan&#x27;s footsteps, journalist Robert MacNeil penned &quot;Burden of Desire&quot; (1992) and used the explosion as a metaphor for the societal and cultural changes of the day. MacLennan and MacNeil&#x27;s use of the romance genre to fictionalize the explosion is similar to the first attempt by Lieutenant-Colonel Frank McKelvey Bell, author of the novella &quot;A Romance of the Halifax Disaster&quot; (1918). This work follows the love affair of a young woman and an injured soldier. Keith Ross Leckie wrote a miniseries entitled &quot;Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion&quot; (2003), which took the title but has no relationship to Janet Kitz&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion and the Road to Recovery&quot; (1990). The film was criticized for distortions and inaccuracies.
The response to the explosion from Boston and the appreciation in Halifax cemented ongoing warm Boston–Halifax relations. In 1918, Halifax sent a Christmas tree to Boston in thanks and remembrance for the help that the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee provided immediately after the disaster. That gift was revived in 1971 by the Lunenburg County Christmas Tree Producers Association, which began an annual donation of a large tree to promote Christmas tree exports as well as acknowledge Boston&#x27;s support after the explosion. The gift was later taken over by the Nova Scotia government to continue the goodwill gesture and to promote trade and tourism. The tree is Boston&#x27;s official Christmas tree and is lit on Boston Common throughout the holiday season. In deference to its symbolic importance for both cities, the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has specific guidelines for selecting the tree and has tasked an employee to oversee the selection.

<text>The Aermacchi or Macchi MB-326 is a light military jet trainer designed and produced by the Italian aircraft manufacter Aermacchi. It is one of the most commercially successful aircraft of its type, being bought by more than 10 countries and produced under licence in Australia, Brazil and South Africa.

The MB-326 was developed during a period when &quot;all-through&quot; jet training was considered by many air forces to be the most cost-effective model for training of military pilots. Accordingly, Aermacchi designed it as a single type of aircraft that could readily perform both elementary and advanced training right through to a near combat-ready standard. After it was proposed during the 1950s, the Italian Air Force (AMI) quickly became interested in the MB-326, and an initial contract to produce three prototypes was issued following a competition. Several design refinements were made prior to the AMI, giving its official approval of the project during 1956. On 10 December 1957, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. On 15 December 1958, the Italian government ordered 15 pre-series aircraft; further orders soon followed.

During February 1962, the MB-326 formally entered service with the AMI. Operational experience with the type demonstrated that the advantages of operating just one type for all training purposes, being simplicity and economy of scale, were usually outweighed by the disadvantages, namely the higher purchase and operating costs of a large all-jet training fleet. Many operators therefore soon switched to operating the MB-326 in conjunction with a cheaper piston-engined type for basic training purposes. Over time, the MB-326 found its primary role as a lead-in trainer to prepare pilots for transition to very high performance fighter aircraft. It set many category records, including an altitude record of 56,807 ft (17,315 m) on 18 March 1966. While the majority of operators were military, some civil organisations also flew the type; Italy&#x27;s national flag carrier Alitalia conducted pilot training using a handful of MB-326s.

In excess of 800 MB-326s were built between 1961 and 1975. Brazil was the biggest export customer for the MB-326, which included its produced under license by Embraer. Licensed production of the type was also performed by Atlas Aircraft Corporation of South Africa. While the MB-326 had been originally conceived as a two-seat trainer, multiple single and two-seat light attack versions were also developed. Armed MB-326 saw combat, the South African Defence Force opting to employ the type during the South African Border War against the People&#x27;s Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and Cuban expeditionary troops in Angola between 1975 and 1989.

==Development==
===Origins===
During the 1950s, a number of countries began to operate compact jet-powered trainer aircraft that possessed similar performance to frontline operational aircraft, often having been produced as two-seat adaptions of these aircraft. Recognising the potential to better fulfil this role, several different companies independently chose to commence the development of purpose-built aircraft to serve as trainers; these included the French Fouga Magister, the American Cessna T-37 Tweet, the British Jet Provost, and the Czechoslovakian Aero L-29. In the aftermath of the devastating Second World War, Italy spent a number of years recuperating and reestablishing its economy; as such, the nation found itself unable to prioritise the necessary financing for the independent development of high-end combat aircraft that would be competitive with the upcoming generation of supersonic interceptors or bombers; accordingly, Italian aviation company Aermacchi elected to instead focus its resources and development efforts upon the production of a line of light fighters and trainer aircraft.

What would become the MB-326 had its origins in a private venture project by Macchi; it was developed by a team headed by Italian aeronautical engineer Ermanno Bazzocchi, the company&#x27;s technical director and chief engineer. Reportedly, Bazzocchi had considered many different configurations for the tentative trainer before the design team chose to proceed with a single-engined design. In accordance with its intended primary use, the airframe was a robust and light all-metal structure, being relatively simple and cheap to construct and to maintain. The design was also to be powered by the British Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engine, an efficient powerplant for the time. The Viper engine had been originally designed as a short-life unit destined for use upon disposable target drones, however, the engine had showed itself to be far more reliable and useful in other roles. During 1954, initial representations by Bazzocchi were made to the Italian Air Ministry. During 1953, the designed airframe and engine combination led to Macchi formally launching the MB-326 programme.

Around the time of the programme&#x27;s launch, the Italian Air Force took interest in the proposed aircraft. The service was considering options for the potential replacement of its existing trainer fleet, thus, upon the commissioning of a competition to select a suitable successor, the MB-326 was an obvious early entrant. A detailed specification was released for the competition, the requirements stated included a maximum load of 7 g when flown at the maximum weight, a lifespan of 5,000 flight hours, an interval of at least 50–60 hours between servicing, ample warning in advance of stalls (to be at least 15 km/h (9 mph) above the aircraft&#x27;s stall speed), the ability to take-off at maximum weight in 800 m (2,625 ft) over a 15 m (50 ft) high obstacle (or 500 m (1,640 ft) when flown at a light weight), being able to land within 450 m (1,480 ft) at minimum weight, a minimum speed of 110/130 km/h and a maximum speed of 700 km/h, a rate of climb at least 15 m/s (2,950 ft/min), and an endurance time of at least three hours at 3,000 m (9,840 ft).

Interest in the proposed MB-326 led to the award of the development contract for three prototypes. The programme was subject to significant refinement around this stage, leading to several modifications being made. Amongst these changes was the elimination of the negative dihedral angle previously present on the horizontal tail surfaces and the substitution of a pair of wing-based airbrakes into one located at a ventral position. During 1956, the AMI gave its official approval of the project and issued a request for the production of a pair of prototypes (later designated as &quot;MM.571&quot; and &quot;MM.572&quot;) as well as a single airframe for static tests. These prototypes were not intended to include several features, such as the ability to equip and deploy armaments or refinements such as cabin pressurization, however, Bazzocchi chose to introduce them regardless.

===Into flight===
On 10 December 1957, the first prototype performed its maiden flight, flown by Macchi&#x27;s chief test pilot Guido Carestiato. This prototype, designated as &quot;I-MAKI,&quot; was first publicly demonstrated over France. During its flight test programme, the MB-326 prototypes demonstrated highly favourable flight characteristics of the design; however, several of the modifications made had negatively affected the overall weight of the aircraft; allegedly, at one stage, the excess weight was 400 kg (880 lb) greater than that given in the initial estimates. The original Viper 8 engine was capable of producing 7.8 kN (1,750 lbf) of thrust; to address the increased weight, the more powerful Viper 9 model was adopted instead, which was capable of generating 0.7 kN (147 lbf) more thrust.

On 22 September 1958, the first prototype was joined by the similarly configured second prototype. It did feature some differences from the earlier aircraft; chiefly, it was powered by a newer model of the Viper engine, the Viper 11, which had been rated to produce 11.1 kN thrust (1,134 kgf, 2,500 lbf). The Viper 11 would be the same standard of engine used on subsequent production standard aircraft. Direct competition to the MB-326 came in the form of the Fiat G.80; this aircraft was both more powerful and was the first real Italian jet, having flown five years earlier. However, the G.80 had several disadvantages, including being heavier, considerably larger and more expensive than its rival; as such, it ultimately lost the trainer contest and remained without a market.

On 15 December 1958, having been suitably impressed, the Italian government placed an order for a batch of 15 pre-series examples on behalf of the AMI. A production line was established at Macchi&#x27;s facility in Masnago, Varese, Northern Italy. Shortly thereafter, the AMI issued its first order for the MB-326 for an initial group of 50 production standard aircraft. During 1960, a larger follow-on order for 100 aircraft was received by Macchi; this sizable commitment was viewed as being a major step towards establishing the company&#x27;s supremacy in jet trainer market.

==Design==

The Aermacchi MB-326 was a low-wing monoplane with an all-metal structure composed of light alloys. It was one of the first jet trainers to be developed with the aim of catering to both for ab initio and advanced instruction. As originally developed, the MB-326 functioned as a refined but simple aircraft capable of covering the considerably wide range of performance characteristics required to cover both ab initio training and advanced instruction alike; other major characteristics of the type included the capacity to deliver a high rate of utilization in conjunction with minimised servicing and maintenance requirements. According to Flight International, the type was suitable for the teaching of the majority of advanced flying techniques. In addition to being relatively easy to fly, a high degree of safety was also intentionally built into it, including adoption of new Martin-Baker-built ejection seats.

The MB-326 was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Viper non-afterburning turbojet engine, initial production aircraft were powered by the Viper 11 model, capable of generating up to 2,500 lb of thrust. The engine possessed multiple favourable attributes, including its general simplicity and robustness, relatively low revolutions per minute (RPM) and turbine entry temperature (TET), rapid acceleration, ease of installation, and its somewhat forgiving nature to mishandling in the air by students. Air was provided to the engine via a pair of low-profile intakes set into the wing roots. The Viper was produced under licence by Italian aviation company Piaggio following an agreement established with its original manufacturer, the British engine firm Bristol Siddeley, during 1959.

In a structural perspective, the MB-326 was relatively straightforward. Both the fuselage and the wing were constructed in three sections; of these, the centre section of the wing was integral to the fuselage. The fuselage was divided into a forward, central, and rear section; the forward section contained the nose wheel and radio systems; the centre part, accommodated the cockpit, fuel tanks and the engine; and the rear section which comprised both the tail unit and jet pipe. The fuel system had one large tank in the middle-fuselage and two in the wingtips; a single-point pressure-fuelling system is located on the starboard side of the aircraft to provide a total refuelling time of around five minutes. The rear of each wing had flaps, and ailerons with a trim surface; each wing had 22 ribs and two spars. Wing fences were added mid-wing to increase the lift characteristics. Accordingly, the MB-326 was readily capable of performing relatively slow speed take-off and landing while retaining an excellent rate of climb.

The MB-326 was outfitted with a tandem cockpit configuration, this arrangement had been chosen to result in a slimmer and more aerodynamically efficient fuselage in comparison to the more usual side-by-side arrangement. It was covered by a bubble canopy for excellent external visibility; it featured a windscreen anti-icing system powered by the engine compressor using bleed air. The cockpit was also pressurised, enabling the MB-326 to conduct high-altitude flight. The ability to fly at higher altitudes was favourable for multiple purposes, including during the execution of aerobatic and navigational training, as well as improving fuel efficiency for long-distance flights. The onboard systems were typically pre-manufactured units which were easy both to access and to remove; several elements were also intentionally interchangeable. The exterior of the aircraft was covered by a total of 80 inspection panels and doors; in-situ engine inspection could be performed via a pair of large access panels set above and below the engine bay while another pair of doors allowed access to the intake duct&#x27;s interior for the inspection of the first-stage compressor rotor blades.

==Operational history==
===Italy===

The MB-326 was one of the last Italian aircraft to hold the distinction of breaking multiple world records. Perhaps the most notable of these occurred during August 1961, when pilot Guido Carestiano set the C1D group 1 category altitude record of 15,489 meters. The record-breaking flights also provided publicity for the MB-326. In particular, one pilot, Massimo Ralli, was responsible for the establishment of several different records while flying the type:
* 8 February 1966, climbing records: 2 min 2 sec to 3,000 m, 3 min 56 sec to 6,000 m, 6 min 39 sec to 9,000 m, and 12,000 m in 10 min 53 sec.
* 18 March 1966, 15,690 m altitude record in horizontal flight, and 17,315 m with a launched climb.
* 18 July 1966, endurance record, with 970 km
* 2 August 1966, speed record over a 3 km straight: 871 km/h
* December 1966: speed of 880.586 km/h over 15–25 km, 831.007 km/h over 100 km, 777.667 km/h over 500 km, and another endurance record at 777.557 km

These high-profile successes functioned as objective statements of the capable performance of the MB-326 and established the type as being one of the best aircraft amongst its contemporaries in its category. Another pilot Riccardo Peracchi, who was employed by for AMI, frequently demonstrated the manoeuvrability and controllability of the aircraft at airshows for a number of years. While Peracchi displayed the MB-326&#x27;s agility, Ralli concentrated on exploring its cutting-edge performance; meanwhile, early customers of the aircraft were typically reporting their satisfaction with the type to Macchi.

The first production MB-326s, following a relatively protracted development cycle, were first delivered to the Lecce-Galatina school of the AMI&#x27;s 214° Group, these were temporarily fielded at Brindisi, Apulia. On 22 March 1962, the MB-326 formally entered squadron service with 43° Flyer course. The type was soon used to replace the aging North American T-6 Texan; typically, within the space of 130 hours, pilots would be as prepared to graduate as they would have been after receiving 210 hours training in the older T-6.

As a trainer, the MB-326 was considerably costlier but was met with enthusiasm amongst students; additionally, when used in combination with the Fiat G.91T advanced trainer, it enabled the enactment of an &quot;entirely-jet&quot; training course for AMI pilots, and moreover these were domestically designed and produced aircraft. According to aerospace publication Flight International, during the early 1960s, the AMI&#x27;s flight training programme was heavily influenced by the impending entry into service of the Lockheed F-104G Starfighter.

As well as being amongst the first customers to procure the aircraft, the AMI would be amongst the final customers of the later-built models of the MB-326 as well. The service ordered a batch of 12 &quot;MB-326E&quot;, comprising six MB-326 updated to &quot;MB-326G&quot;, and six newly produced (MM.54384/389). They had provisions for armament, but the engine was the Viper 11 Mk 200 and not the Viper 20 Mk 540. In Italian service, the MB-326 was replaced by the MB-339 between 1981 and 1984, acting after that as fast linkage aircraft, replacing the old T-33s that were slightly faster. Unusually, the MB-326 did not see service with the Frecce Tricolori aerobatic team, who kept their faster G.91PANs (they were later replaced by MB-339s).

In addition to its AMI service, the MB-326 was also employed in a civilian capacity within Italy. National flag carrier Alitalia placed an order for four trainer-configured aircraft, designated as the &quot;D&quot; version; these were expressly demilitarized and equipped with specialised instrumentation in order to train the airliner&#x27;s pilots in preparation for the arrival of the new generation of jetliners that were being procured by the airliner.

Neither the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; models of the MB-326 would ever be realized. The &quot;A&quot; variant had been intended to be operated as a light attack aircraft, armed with a pair of 7.62 mm machine guns which were to be installed upon the aircraft&#x27;s nose. While none were originally built, a number of MB-326s were later referred to by the &quot;A&quot; designation, however, this was meant to indicate that these had been provisioned with a Marconi-built AD-370 automatic direction finder (ADF). The &quot;C&quot; version was envisioned as being provisioned with a nose-mounted North American Search And Ranging Radar (NASARR) unit and other electronic equipment in order to be used for the training of AMI F-104 pilots, however, this variant only appeared as a mock-up.

===Australia===
The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) used the &quot;MB-326H&quot; as a jet trainer. A total of 97 were ordered: 12 were delivered by Macchi, 18 assembled from kits in Australia, and another 67 were built by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and Hawker Aircraft with the designation CA-30. They were essentially similar to the &quot;MB-326G&quot; but with improved avionics. The RAAF&#x27;s aerobatic team, The Roulettes, flew the MB-326H from December 1970 until 1989. RAAF pilot training until 1975 consisted of 60 hours pre-selection on CAC Winjeels (from 1975 onwards the PAC CT/4 Airtrainer), 150 hours medium training and another 75 hours advanced training on MB-326H. Pilots selected for combat aircraft then progressed to the Mirage IIIOD.

Although well-suited to its task and widely liked for its excellent handling, the service career of the MB-326 was cut short because of structural fatigue problems. The Australian fleet, for example, had a life-of-type extension program in the 1980s, and were then re-winged in the early 1990s after a fatigue-related crash. Even so, the MB-326 was supplemented by new Pilatus PC-9 trainers to reduce the flying hours being accumulated by the MB-326. The last examples of the MB-326 were withdrawn by 2001 and replaced by the Hawk 127.

===Brazil===
Brazil was the main customer for the MB-326, in 1970 ordering two prototypes and 166 &quot;MB-326GC&quot;s, called the AT-26 &quot;Xavante&quot;. It was produced under license by Embraer with a further six for Togo and 10 for Paraguay.

The aircraft was important also for two developments: from the MB.326K the MB.326L was produced, this was the direct ancestor of the Aermacchi MB.339. With license-building in Brazil, the MB.326 opened the field to further collaborations, leading to the AMX. Neither the MB.339 nor the AMX were as successful as the MB.326, but this machine was capable of further steps in technology and commerce.

===South Africa===
South Africa obtained a license to produce the &quot;MB-326M&quot; (similar to the &#x27;G&#x27; model), as the &quot;Impala&quot; Mk I in 1964 with production starting in 1966. It received 40 Italian-built aircraft followed by about 125 built locally by the Atlas Aircraft Corporation, using them both as trainers and in an armed configuration. Seven examples of the &quot;MB-326K&quot; were also bought as light attack aircraft, with a further 15 assembled from kits, while around 78 were license-produced and known as the &quot;Impala&quot; Mk II. Licence production of the single seat version began in 1974. The Impala Mk II, locally manufactured and equipped with French armament, was also advanced with a South African ECM suite.
The South African Defence Force employed Impalas during campaigns against the People&#x27;s Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and Cuban expeditionary troops in Angola between 1975 and 1989. Impala pilots typically flew at 550–650 km/h at a height of 15 m to avoid Angolan air defences. Over the course of the South African Border War, one was downed by an SA-7; another returned with an unexploded missile in its exhaust.

The aircraft had many advantages over expensive supersonic jets. Although slower, it could operate from relatively primitive airfields and strike swiftly. The South African Air Force (SAAF) used up to 6 x 120 kg or 4 x 250 kg bombs. The main armament consisted of 68 mm SNEB rocket-launchers (four x 6 or two x 18), and two 30 mm autocannon (with 300 rounds). These cannons were the real bonus for the Impala Mk II, helping to give a superior performance compared to earlier two-seat versions. The latter could also carry a pair of 30 mm DEFA guns in under-wing pods. However, dual capability as trainer-attackers was better appreciated, as was the availability of six hard points and so dual-seat versions were far more common. Six squadrons were equipped with the Impala Mk II in the SAAF during the 1970s and 1980s. Prior to Operation Moduler, most Impalas were withdrawn from their operating bases in South-West Africa, leaving the work to Mirage IIIs and Blackburn Buccaneers.

Impala Mk IIs were also opportunistically used as interceptors. In several encounters in 1985 with Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters, they shot down a total of six. This happened during a crucial phase of the ground war, when Angolan and Cuban troops were checked in an offensive against UNITA bases. This ended in disaster for the Angolan/Cuban alliance when their supplies were cut off by UNITA and the SAAF and front line troops ran out of ammunition. Helicopters were being used to supply the besieged troops and the SAAF cut off this link. Two Mi-24s were shot down in the first encounter while escorting Mi-17s. The MiG-21s that escorted them flew too high to react in time. Two days later the Impala Mk IIs struck again, downing two Mi-24s and two Mi-17s. Attacks on unsuspecting helicopters were carried out with only two guns per aircraft. The single seat Impala Mk IIs were also sometimes armed with Matra R550 Magic air-to-air missiles for self-defence. The Impala Mk II operated at extreme ranges and had to fly very low, climbing only when helicopters were seen at medium altitude. After each attack they returned to low level to avoid interception by enemy MiGs.

The Silver Falcons, the SAAF aerobatic team, were equipped before with Impala Mk Is.

The flying school for Impalas was Flying Training School at Langebaanweg while operational squadrons were 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 Squadrons, with 85 Combat Flying School also having a small number of Impalas to supplement their Mirage trainers.

===Argentina===
A number of MB-326 aircraft, together with the more modern MB-339, formed the equipment of the Argentine Navy&#x27;s &quot;1 Escuadrilla de Ataque&quot; in 1982, when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. A number of MB-326s were deployed to bases along the Argentine coast immediately following the Argentine invasion, but soon returned to the squadron&#x27;s base at Punta Indio. While several MB-339s were deployed to the Falklands, the MB-326s remained on the mainland. After the end of the war, 11 EMB-326GBs were received from Brazil to replace losses and restore &quot;1 Escuadrilla de Ataque&quot;″s strength.

===Other operators===
In stark contrast to the competing Fiat G.91, which was often considered to be not very convincing as a light fighter, the MB-326 was quick to achieve several export successes in this capacity. The type had ultimately failed to impress other NATO nations, who only sparsely adopted it into their air forces. However, the MB-326 did achieve a visible measure of success amongst many Third World countries, leading to the MB-326 seeing considerable use as a front-line combat aircraft in a number of regional conflicts.

Eight &quot;MB-326B&quot;s were ordered by Tunisia in 1965. These were developed from basic MB-326s with a weapons capability, with the 37th series AMI aircraft being converted (it had civilian markings &quot;I-MAKC&quot;). The main innovation was its ground attack capability, with six underwing pylons, holding a maximum of 907 kg of stores. In the same year, Ghana ordered nine similar &quot;MB-326F&quot;s.

Other &quot;MB-326G&quot;s used the Viper Mk 20 engine which provided 1,524 kg of thrust, and were consequently faster and had an increased payload of 1,814 kg max. Argentina ordered eight, initially as the &quot;MB-326K&quot;, later called the &quot;MB-326GB&quot;.

Another 17 &quot;MB-326GC&quot;s were built in Italy for Zaire (Force Arienne Zairoise) and 23 for the Zambian Air Force.

The &quot;MB-326K&quot; (originally known as the MB-336) was the last generation model, fitted with the Viper Mk 600 engine, capable of 1,814 kg thrust to give an even better performance. The first flight took place on 22 August 1970. The two prototypes were &quot;I-AMKK&quot; and &quot;I-KMAK&quot;, the MB-326G was converted to this new model.

Dubai bought three in 1974, and a further three in 1978 (&quot;MB-326KD&quot;), Tunisia eight (&quot;MB-326KT&quot;), Ghana nine (&quot;MB-326KB&quot;) and Zaire eight (&quot;MB-326KB&quot;).

The &quot;MB-326L&quot; was essentially the MB-326K with two seats. Two &quot;MB-326LD&quot; were supplied to Dubai and four &quot;MB-326LD&quot; to Tunisia.

The measures to save costs led the MB-326 to be frequently substituted for by propeller-driven models, however, the Macchi was often flexible enough to act as a medium trainer and light attack aircraft.

<text>The Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod is a music festival which takes place every year during the second week of July in Llangollen, North Wales. It is one of several large annual Eisteddfodau in Wales. Singers and dancers from around the world are invited to take part in over 20 competitions followed each evening by concerts on the main stage. Over five thousand singers, dancers and instrumentalists from around 50 countries perform to audiences of more than 50,000 over the 6 days of the event.

Famous performers at Llangollen have included Luciano Pavarotti (who first competed in Llangollen in 1955 with his father and a choir from their home town Modena, and for whom the Eisteddfod&#x27;s principal trophy – the Choir of the World Pavarotti Trophy – is named), Red Army Ensemble, Julian Lloyd Webber and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The final Sunday Evening Gala Concert has featured Katherine Jenkins, Bryn Terfel, Kiri Te Kanawa, James Galway and Montserrat Caballe.

==Origins==

The origins of the International Eisteddfod go back to 1943, when Harold Tudor, an officer of the British Council, arranged a visit for members of governments-in-exile to the Welsh National Eisteddfod in Bangor. The excursion was well received, especially by the noted writer and poet Juraj Slavik, the Minister for the Interior in the Czechoslovakia government-in-exile. Following the visit he wrote to Tudor praising the value of music as a way of healing the effects of war. The following year an international concert was held as part of the Llandybie National Eisteddfod.

Towards the end of 1945 Tudor proposed that an international choral festival be added to the 1947 Welsh National Eisteddfod; however, the Council of the National Eisteddfod felt that as all their effort was directed to rebuilding their own organisation, they could not take on such a scheme. Tudor modified his proposal into an independent music festival, and found support for this idea from W. S. Gwynn Williams, Welsh composer and music publisher, and George Northing, a teacher from Ysgol Dinas Brân and chairman of Llangollen town council. Gwynn Williams and Northing both pressed for the Eisteddfod to be in their home town of Llangollen.

The public gave support to this idea at two public meetings in May 1946, but concerns were also raised about who would come, where the event would be held and how the event would be financed. The British Council offered to help find choirs from Europe and to give financial support; however, the town decided to raise the money through a public subscription, and quickly gathered over £1100. George Northing was appointed as director of the executive board; Gwynn Williams became music director; Harold Tudor was director of publicity; and W. Clayton Russon, a local businessman and High Sheriff of Merionethshire, became president.

Plans to hold the event on the school field of Dinas Brân County School progressed throughout 1946-47. Accommodation for the overseas competitors would be in houses in the town and surrounding area, and domestic participants would be given beds in church and school halls. As rationing was still in place, ration coupons had to be found for all the visitors, and the Minister of Food was eventually persuaded to supply these.

In June 1947 it was time for competitors to travel to Llangollen, but a railway strike had started in France, and there was serious doubt as to whether any overseas competitors would be able to arrive. The organisers were relieved when the first coach of competitors arrived, bringing the ladies&#x27; choir Grupo Musical Feminino from Porto. They were the eventual winners of the Ladies Competition, whilst the Men&#x27;s Competition was won by the Hungarian workers&#x27; choir, who had completed their journey to Wales by hitch-hiking when their train had been cancelled at Basel because of the French strike.

The Esperanto Society played a significant part in the first year, when it was felt that there could be a shortage of participants. Reto Rossetti, a well-known figure and author in the Esperanto movement, was asked to help, and through publicity in Esperanto magazines and to the surprise of the organisers, several groups contacted the Eisteddfod committee. Two troupes of Spanish dancers, on a tour of Britain sponsored by the British Council and the Esperanto Society, arrived and despite there not being a dance competition in the first year, performed to delighted audiences. Folk dance competitions have featured in every subsequent Llangollen Eisteddfod. The eisteddfod was brought to close with what has now become the traditional Sunday concert, featuring Sir John Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra. The 1947 International Eisteddfod was hailed as an unqualified success, with praise for the organisers, the founders, and all the competitors. There was even a surplus of £1,432 to be used for the next year&#x27;s event.

In 1949, just four years after the end of the war, there was a major test mission to promote reconciliation when a choir from Lübeck came to compete at the Eisteddfod. However there had been Austrian and Italian choirs. As the choir tell it in a letter now in the Clwyd archive in Ruthin, there was a tearful welcome from the eisteddfod helpers and the townspeople, with tea and sandwiches, when the choir arrived at the Llangollen station. Later, the festival&#x27;s compère Mr Hywel Roberts introduced the choir with the words: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our friends from Germany.&quot; The town organised a concert to help the choir raise funds, and in 2015 members of the choir were still corresponding with Llangollen friends.
==Motto==
The Welsh motto of the International Eisteddfod, &quot;Byd gwyn fydd byd a gano. Gwaraidd fydd ei gerddi fo&quot;, was composed by the poet T. Gwynn Jones in 1946, a few months after the eisteddfod was established. It has appeared on the Eisteddfod trophies, artwork and various artefacts of the eisteddfod for 75 years. It is usually translated as: &quot;Blessed is a world that sings. Gentle are its songs.&quot;

However the word &quot;gwyn&quot; has a number of meanings, for example &quot;white&quot; as well as &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;holy&quot;, and it is used many times in the Bible, for example in the Beatitudes, to translate the Greek word μακάριοι, where English uses &quot;blessed&quot;. It is said that Gwynn Williams was referring to this in selecting the motto. However in March 2023, it appeared that the motto was being misinterpreted by English speakers to mean the colour &quot;white&quot;. There was a proposal for the eisteddfod to change its motto, but there was a wave of opposition to this, and it did not proceed.

==Recent years==

The 2007 Eisteddfod included performances by José Carreras, Joan Baez, and Hayley Westenra. In 2008, there were performances by Elaine Paige, All Angels, and Alfie Boe; in 2009, performances by Barbara Dickson, Sir Willard White, Blake, and Natasha Marsh, with a James Bond 007 spectacular, featuring the Orchestra of Welsh National Opera, as the Sunday finale; 2010 saw performances by Katherine Jenkins and Nigel Kennedy. In 2011 there were concerts featuring Lulu, Russell Watson, Faryl Smith, Ruthie Henshaw and McFly.

In 2012 the Eisteddfod played host to Lesley Garrett, Alison Balsom, Nicola Benedettii and Sian Edwards in a celebration concert for the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. There were also appearances by Alfie Boe, Steffan Morris, and Valentina Nafornta, and a performance of Karl Jenkins&#x27;s new work &quot;The Peacemakers&quot; by a specially formed massed choir accompanied by the Llangollen International Eisteddfod Orchestra. The week was rounded off by the Grand Finale Concert, featuring Fflur Wyn, Wynne Evans, Mark Llewelyn Evans, John Owen-Jones and Richard Balcombe.

In recent years the Sunday evening concert has been given over to more &quot;popular&quot; music. Starting with McFly in 2011, subsequent concerts have included UB40, Status Quo (band), and Manic Street Preachers.

==Parade==
A parade is usually held on the Tuesday of the Eisteddfod week, in which both the locals and visitors, take part dancing, singing, and playing musical instruments, whilst marching the streets of Llangollen. However, in 2016 the parade was moved to the Friday to enable more competitors to take part.

<text>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) is an American government-funded media organization broadcasting news and analyses in 27 languages to 23 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Middle East. Headquartered in Prague since 1995, RFE/RL operates 21 local bureaus with over 500 core staff, 1,300 freelancers, and 680 employees at its corporate offices in Washington, D.C. Nicola Careem serves as the editor-in-chief.

Founded during the Cold War, RFE began in 1949 targeting Soviet satellite states, while RL, established in 1951, focused on the Soviet Union. Initially funded covertly by the CIA until 1972, the two merged in 1976. RFE/RL was headquartered in Munich from 1949 to 1995, with additional broadcasts from Portugal&#x27;s Glória do Ribatejo until 1996. Soviet authorities jammed their signals, and communist regimes often infiltrated their operations.

Today, RFE/RL is a private 501(c)(3) corporation supervised by the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees all government-supported international broadcasting. Since the Revolutions of 1989 and the Soviet Union&#x27;s dissolution, the organization&#x27;s European presence has been reduced.

==Early history==

=== Radio Free Europe ===

Radio Free Europe was created and grew in its early years through the efforts of the National Committee for a Free Europe (NCFE), an anti-communist CIA front organization that was formed by Allen Dulles in New York City in 1949. RFE/RL received funds covertly from the CIA until 1972. During RFE&#x27;s earliest years of existence, the CIA and U.S. Department of State issued broad policy directives, and a system evolved where broadcast policy was determined through negotiation between them and RFE staff.

Radio Free Europe received widespread public support from Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;Crusade for Freedom&quot; campaign. In 1950, over 16 million Americans signed Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;Freedom Scrolls&quot; on a publicity trip to more than 20 U.S. cities and contributed $1,317,000 to the expansion of RFE.

Writer Sig Mickelson said that the NCFE&#x27;s mission was to support refugees and provide them with a useful outlet for their opinions and creativity while increasing exposure to the modern world. The NCFE divided its program into three parts: exile relations, radio, and American contacts.

The United States funded a long list of projects to counter the &quot;Communist appeal&quot; among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world. RFE was developed out of a belief that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means. American policymakers such as George Kennan and John Foster Dulles acknowledged that the Cold War was essentially a war of ideas. The implementation of surrogate radio stations was a key part of the greater psychological war effort.

RFE was modeled after Radio in the American Sector (RIAS) a U.S. government-sponsored radio service initially intended for Germans living in the American sector of Berlin. According to Arch Puddington, a former bureau manager for RFE/RL, it was also widely listened to by East Germans. Staffed almost entirely by Germans with minimal U.S. supervision, the station provided free media to German listeners.
In January 1950, the NCFE obtained a transmitter base at Lampertheim, West Germany, and on July 4 of the same year RFE completed its first broadcast aimed at Czechoslovakia. In late 1950, RFE began to assemble a full-fledged foreign broadcast staff, becoming more than a &quot;mouthpiece for exiles&quot;. Teams of journalists were hired for each language service, and an elaborate system of intelligence gathering provided up-to-date broadcast material. Most of this material came from a network of well-connected émigrés and interviews with travelers and defectors. RFE did not use paid agents inside the Iron Curtain and based its bureaus in regions popular with exiles. RFE also extensively monitored Communist bloc publications and radio services, creating a body of information that would later serve as a resource for organizations across the world.

In addition to its regular broadcasts, RFE spread broadcasts through a series of operations that distributed leaflets via meteorological balloons; one such operation, Prospero, sent messages to Czechoslovakia. From October 1951 to November 1956, the skies of Central Europe were filled with more than 350,000 balloons carrying over 300 million leaflets, posters, books, and other printed matter. The nature of the leaflets varied, and according to Arch Puddington included messages of support and encouragement &quot;to citizens suffering under communist oppression&quot;, &quot;satirical criticisms of communist regimes and leaders&quot;, information about dissident movements and human rights campaigns, and messages expressing the solidarity of the American people with the residents of Eastern European nations. Puddington stated that &quot;the project served as a publicity tool to solidify RFE&#x27;s reputation as an unbiased broadcaster&quot;.

=== Radio Liberty ===

Whereas Radio Free Europe broadcast to Soviet satellite countries, Radio Liberty broadcast to the Soviet Union. Radio Liberty was formed by American Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia (Amcomlib) in 1951. Originally named Radio Liberation from Bolshevism, the station was renamed in 1956 to Radio Liberation in 1956, and received its present name, Radio Liberty, after a policy statement emphasizing &quot;liberalization&quot; rather than &quot;liberation&quot;.

Radio Liberty began broadcasting from Lampertheim on March 1, 1953, gaining a substantial audience when it covered the death of Joseph Stalin four days later. In order to better serve a greater geographic area, RFE supplemented its shortwave transmissions from Lampertheim with broadcasts from a transmitter base at Glória, Portugal in 1951. It also had a base at Oberwiesenfeld Airport on the outskirts of Munich, employing several former Nazi agents who had been involved in the Ostministerium under Gerhard von Mende during World War II. In 1955, Radio Liberty began broadcasting programs to Russia&#x27;s eastern provinces from shortwave transmitters located on Taiwan. In 1959, Radio Liberty commenced broadcasts from a base at Platja de Pals, Spain.

Radio Liberty expanded its audience by broadcasting programs in languages other than Russian. By March 1954, Radio Liberty was broadcasting six to seven hours daily in eleven languages. By December 1954, Radio Liberty was broadcasting in 17 languages including Ukrainian, Belarusian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Turkmen, Uzbek, Tatar, Bashkir, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Georgian, and other languages of the Caucasus and Central Asia.

=== List of languages ===
==Cold War years==
===Radio Free Europe===
According to certain European politicians such as Petr Nečas, RFE played a significant role in the collapse of communism and the development of democracy in Eastern Europe. Unlike government-censored programs, RFE publicized anti-Soviet protests and nationalist movements. Its audience increased substantially following the failed Berlin riots of 1953 and the highly publicized defection of Józef Światło. Arch Puddington argues that its Hungarian service&#x27;s coverage of Poland&#x27;s Poznań riots in 1956 served as an inspiration for the Hungarian revolution that year.

====Hungary====
During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, RFE broadcasts encouraged rebels to fight and suggested that Western support was imminent. These RFE broadcasts violated Eisenhower&#x27;s policy, which had determined that the United States would not provide military support for the Revolution. According to Arch Puddington, a former bureau manager for RFL/RL, a number of changes were implemented at RFE in the wake of this scandal, including the establishment of the Broadcast Analysis Division to ensure that broadcasts were accurate and professional while maintaining the journalists&#x27; autonomy.

====Romania====
RFE was seen as a serious threat by Romanian president Nicolae Ceaușescu. From the mid-1970s to his overthrow and execution in December 1989, Ceaușescu waged a vengeful war against the RFE/RL under the program &quot;Ether&quot;. Ether operations included physical attacks on Romanian journalists working for RFE/RL, including the controversial circumstances surrounding the deaths of three directors of RFE/RL&#x27;s Romanian Service.

====1981 RFE/RL Munich bombing====
On February 21, 1981, RFE/RL&#x27;s headquarters in Munich was struck by a massive bomb, causing $2 million in damage. Several employees were injured, but there were no fatalities. Stasi files opened after 1989 indicated that the bombing was carried out by a group under the direction of Ilich Ramírez Sánchez (known as &quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot;), and paid for by Nicolae Ceaușescu, president of Romania. 

But, according to the former head of the KGB Counterintelligence Department K, general Oleg Kalugin, the bombing operation was planned over two years by Department K, with the active involvement of a KGB mole inside the radio station, Oleg Tumanov. This revelation directly implicates KGB colonel Oleg Nechiporenko, who recruited Tumanov in the early 1960s and was his Moscow curator. Nechiporenko has never denied his involvement. In an interview with Radio Liberty in 2003, he justified the bombing on the grounds that RFE/RL was an American propaganda tool against the Soviet Union. Tumanov was exfiltrated back to the USSR in 1986. Nechiporenko contacts with Carlos in the 1970s were confirmed by Nechiporenko himself in an article published by &quot;Segodnya&quot; in 2000 and by an article in &quot;Izvestia&quot; in 2001.

====Chernobyl disaster====
For the first two days following the Chernobyl disaster on April 26, 1986, the official Eastern Bloc media did not report any news about the disaster, nor any full account for another four months. According to the Hoover Institute, the people of the Soviet Union &quot;became frustrated with inconsistent and contradictory reports&quot;, and 36% of them turned to Western radio to provide accurate and pertinent information. Listenership at RFE/RL &quot;shot up dramatically&quot; as a &quot;great many hours&quot; of broadcast time were devoted to the dissemination of life-saving news and information following the disaster. Broadcast topics included &quot;precautions for exposure to radioactive fallout&quot; and reporting on the plight of the Estonians who were tasked with providing the clean-up operations in Ukraine.

====Poland and Czechoslovakia====
Communist governments also sent agents to infiltrate RFE&#x27;s headquarters. Although some remained on staff for extended periods of time, government authorities discouraged their agents from interfering with broadcast activity, fearing that this could arouse suspicions and detract from their original purpose of gathering information on the radio station&#x27;s activities. From 1965 to 1971, an agent of the SB (&quot;Służba Bezpieczeństwa&quot;, Communist Poland&#x27;s security service) successfully infiltrated the station with an operative, Captain Andrzej Czechowicz. According to former Voice of America Polish service director Ted Lipien: 
&quot;Czechowicz is perhaps the most well known communist-era Polish spy who was still an active agent while working at RFE in the late 1960s. Technically, he was not a journalist. As a historian by training, he worked in the RFE&#x27;s media analysis service in Munich. After more than five years, Czechowicz returned to Poland in 1971 and participated in programs aimed at embarrassing Radio Free Europe and the United States government.&quot;

According to Richard Cummings, former Security Chief of Radio Free Europe, other espionage incidents included a failed attempt by a Czechoslovak Intelligence Service (StB) agent in 1959 to poison the salt shakers in the organization&#x27;s cafeteria.

In late 1960, an upheaval in the Czechoslovak service led to a number of dramatic changes in the organization&#x27;s structure. RFE&#x27;s New York headquarters could no longer effectively manage their Munich subsidiary. As a result major management responsibilities were transferred to Munich, making RFE a European-based organization.

According to Puddington, Polish Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa and Russian reformer Grigory Yavlinsky would later recall secretly listening to the broadcasts despite the heavy jamming.

===Jamming===
The Soviet government turned its efforts towards blocking reception of Western programs. To limit access to foreign broadcasts, the Central Committee decreed that factories should remove all components allowing short-wave reception from USSR-made radio receivers. However, consumers easily learned that the necessary spare parts were available on the black market, and electronics engineers opposing the idea would gladly convert radios back to being able to receive short-wave transmissions.

The most extensive form of reception obstruction was radio jamming. This was controlled by the KGB, which in turn reported to the Central Committee. Jamming was an expensive and arduous procedure, and its efficacy is still debated. In 1958, the Central Committee mentioned that the sum spent on jamming was greater than the sum spent on domestic and international broadcasting combined. The Central Committee has admitted that circumventing jamming was both possible and practised in the Soviet Union. Due to limited resources, authorities prioritized jamming based on the location, language, time, and theme of Western transmissions. Highly political programs in Russian, broadcast at prime time to urban centers, were perceived as the most dangerous. Seen as less politically threatening, Western music such as jazz was often transmitted unjammed.

During and after the Cuban Missile Crisis in late 1962, jamming was intensified. The Cuban Missile Crisis, however, was followed by a five-year period when the jamming of most foreign broadcasters ceased, only to intensify again with the Prague Spring in 1968. It ceased again in 1973, when Henry Kissinger became the U.S. Secretary of State. The end to jamming came abruptly on 21 November 1988 when Soviet and Eastern European jamming of virtually all foreign broadcasts, including RFE/RL services, ceased at 21:00 CET.

===United States===
During the Cold War, RFE was often criticized in the United States as not being sufficiently anti-communist. Although its non-governmental status spared it from full scale McCarthyist investigations, several RFE journalists, including the director of the Czech service, Ferdinand Peroutka, were accused of being soft on Communism. Fulton Lewis, a U.S. radio commentator and fervent anti-communist, was one of RFE&#x27;s sharpest critics throughout the 1950s. His critical broadcasts inspired other journalists to investigate the inner workings of the organization, including its connection to the CIA. When its CIA ties were exposed in the 1960s, direct funding responsibility shifted to Congress.

====Funding====

RFE/RL received funds from the CIA until 1972. The CIA&#x27;s relationship with the radio stations began to break down in 1967, when &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine published an exposé claiming that the CIA was channeling funds to civilian organizations. Further investigation into the CIA&#x27;s funding activities revealed its connection to both RFE and RL, sparking significant media outrage.

In 1971, the radio stations came under public spotlight once more when U.S. Senator Clifford Case introduced Senate Bill 18, which would have removed funding for RFE and RL from the CIA&#x27;s budget, appropriated $30 million to pay for fiscal year 1972 activities, and required the State Department to temporarily oversee the radio stations.

In May 1972, President Richard Nixon appointed a special commission to deliberate RFE/RL&#x27;s future. The commission proposed that funding come directly from the United States Congress and that a new organization, the Board for International Broadcasting (BIB) would simultaneously link the stations and the federal government, and serve as an editorial buffer between them.

According to Arch Puddington, a former bureau manager for RFE/RL, though both radio stations initially received most of their funding from the CIA, RFE maintained a strong sense of autonomy; Puddington says that under Cord Meyer, the CIA officer in charge of overseeing broadcast services from 1954 to 1971, the CIA took a position of minimal government interference in radio affairs and programming.

In 1974, they came under the control of an organization called the Board for International Broadcasting (BIB). The BIB was designed to receive appropriations from Congress, give them to radio managements, and oversee the appropriation of funds. On 1 October 1976, the two radio stations merged to form Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and added the three Baltic language services to their repertoire.

==1980s: &quot;Glasnost&quot; and the Iron Curtain&#x27;s fall==
Funding for RFE/RL increased during the Reagan administration. President Ronald Reagan, a fervent anticommunist, urged the stations to be more critical of the communist regimes. This presented a challenge to RFE/RL&#x27;s broadcast strategy, which had been very cautious since the controversy over its alleged role in the Hungarian Revolution.

During the Mikhail Gorbachev era in the Soviet Union under Glasnost, RFE/RL benefited significantly from the Soviet Union&#x27;s new openness. Gorbachev stopped the practice of jamming the broadcasts. In addition, dissident politicians and officials could be freely interviewed by RFE/RL for the first time without fearing persecution or imprisonment. By 1990, Radio Liberty had become the most listened-to Western radio station broadcasting to the Soviet Union.

Its coverage of the 1991 August coup enriched sparse domestic coverage of the event and drew in a wide audience. The broadcasts allowed Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin to stay in touch with the Russian people during this turbulent period. Boris Yeltsin later expressed his gratitude through a presidential decree allowing Radio Liberty to open a permanent bureau in Moscow.

=== Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Velvet Revolution ===
Following the November 17 demonstrations in 1989 and brutal crackdown by Czechoslovak riot police, , a porter at a dormitory in Prague, reported that a student, Martin Šmíd, had been killed during the clashes. The Charter 77 activist Petr Uhl believed this account and passed it along to major news organizations, who broadcast it. After Reuters and the Voice of America (VOA) reported the story, RFE/RL decided to run it too. However, the report later turned out to be false. The story is credited by many sources with inspiring Czechoslovak citizens to join the subsequent (larger) demonstrations which eventually brought down the communist government.

==After 1991==
In 1995, RFE/RL moved its headquarters from Munich to Prague, to the building of the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly. It had been vacant since the 1992 dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The Clinton Administration reduced funding significantly and placed the service under the United States Information Agency&#x27;s oversight.

RFE/RL ended broadcasts to Hungary in 1993 and stopped broadcasts to Poland in 1997. On January 31, 1994, RFE/RL launched broadcasts to the former Yugoslavia in Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian languages. In the late 1990s RFE/RL launched broadcast to Kosovo in Albanian and to North Macedonia in Macedonian. Broadcast to the Czech Republic proceeded for three more years under the agreement with Czech Radio. In 2004 RFE/RL stopped broadcasting to Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Romania, and Slovakia.

RFE/RL Chief Jeffrey Gedmin said in 2008 that the agency&#x27;s mission is to serve as a surrogate free press in countries where such press is banned by the government or not fully established. It maintains 20 local bureaus. Governments that are subjected to critical reporting often attempt to obstruct the station&#x27;s activities through a range of tactics, including extensive jamming, shutting down local re-broadcasting affiliates, or finding legal excuses to close down offices.

RFE/RL says that its journalists and freelancers often risk their lives to broadcast information, and their safety has always been a major issue. Reporters have frequently been threatened and persecuted. RFE/RL also faces a number of central security concerns, including cyberterrorist attacks and general terrorist threats. After the September 11 attacks, American and Czech authorities agreed to move RFE/RL&#x27;s Prague headquarters away from the city center in order to make it less vulnerable to terrorist attack. On February 19, 2009, RFE/RL began broadcasting from its new headquarters east of the city center.

=== Beyond Europe ===

RFE/RL says that it continues to struggle with authoritarian regimes for permission to broadcast freely within their countries. On January 1, 2009, Azerbaijan imposed a ban on all foreign media in the country, including RFE/RL. Kyrgyzstan suspended broadcasts of Radio Azattyk, RFE/RL&#x27;s Kyrgyz language service, because it had asked that the government be able to pre-approve its programming. Other states such as Belarus, Iran, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan prohibit re-broadcasting to local stations, making programming difficult for average listeners to access.

In 1998, RFE/RL began broadcasting to Iraq. Iraqi president Saddam Hussein ordered Iraqi Intelligence Service, to &quot;violently disrupt the Iraqi broadcasting of Radio Free Europe&quot;. IIS planned to attack the headquarters with an RPG-7 from a window across the street. Czech Security Information Service (BIS) foiled the plot.

In 2008, Afghan president Hamid Karzai urged his government to provide assistance to a rape victim after listening to her story on Radio Azadi, RFE/RL&#x27;s Afghan service. According to REF/RL in 2009, Radio Azadi was the most popular radio station in Afghanistan, and Afghan listeners mailed hundreds of hand-written letters to the station each month.

In September 2009, RFE/RL announced that it would begin new Pashto-language broadcasting to the Afghanistan–Pakistan border region.

The following month RFE/RL introduced a daily, one-hour Russian-language broadcast, broadcasting to the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The program, called &quot;Ekho Kavkaza&quot; (&quot;Echo of the Caucasus&quot;), focused on local and international news and current affairs, organized in coordination with RFE/RL&#x27;s Georgian Service.

On January 15, 2010, RFE/RL began broadcasting to the Pashtun tribal areas of Pakistan in Pashto. The service, known as Radio Mashaal (&quot;Torch&quot;), was created in an attempt to counter the growing number of local Islamic extremist radio stations broadcasting in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Radio Mashaal says that it broadcasts local and international news with in-depth reports on terrorism, politics, women&#x27;s issues, and health care (with an emphasis on preventive medicine). The station broadcasts roundtable discussions and interviews with tribal leaders and local policymakers, in addition to regular call-in programs.

===2010s ===
On October 14, 2014, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and the Voice of America (VOA) launched a new Russian-language TV news program, &quot;Current Time&quot;, &quot;to provide audiences in countries bordering Russia with a balanced alternative to the disinformation produced by Russian media outlets that is driving instability in the region&quot;. Over the next two years, &quot;Current Time&quot; – led by RFE/RL in cooperation with VOA – expanded to become a 24/7 digital and TV stream for Russian-speaking audiences worldwide.

Around 2017, Voice of America and RFE/RL launched Polygraph.info, and the Russian-language &quot;factograph.info&quot;, as fact-checking sites. On July 19, 2018, RFE/RL announced it will be returning its news services to Bulgaria and Romania by the end of 2018 amid growing concern about a reversal in democratic gains and attacks on the rule of law and the judiciary in the two countries. The Romanian news service re-launched on January 14, 2019, and the Bulgarian service re-launched on January 21, 2019. On 8 September 2020 the Hungarian service was also relaunched.

In a response to the United States Department of Justice requesting RT to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Russia&#x27;s Justice Ministry also requested RFE/RL and Voice of America to register as foreign agents under the law ФЗ N 121-ФЗ / 20.07.2012 in December 2017.

===2020s===
In the aftermath of Belarusian presidential elections of 2020, Radio Liberty and independent media resources experienced significant pressure from the government and law enforcement. Journalists’ accreditations were cancelled by the authorities on October 2, 2020. On July 16, 2021, the office in Minsk and homes of the journalists were raided by the police.

In Russia, the government designated radio&#x27;s website as a &quot;foreign agent&quot; on May 14, 2021. RL&#x27;s bank accounts were frozen. By that time, Roskomnadzor, the Russian mass media regulator, had initiated 520 cases against the broadcaster, with total fines for the RL&#x27;s refusal to mark its content with the &quot;foreign agent&quot; label estimated at $2.4m. On May 19, 2021, RL filed a legal case at the European Court of Human Rights, accusing the Russian government of violating freedom of expression and freedom of the media. 

In March 2023, criminal case was opened against Moscow resident Yury Kokhovets, a participant in the RFE/RL&#x27;s street poll. He faced up to 10 years in prison under Russia&#x27;s 2022 war censorship laws.

In 2022, Radio Free Europe was awarded an Online Journalism Award for the coverage of Russia&#x27;s War on Ukraine.

In 2023, a court in Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan, has accepted a request from the Culture Ministry to ban the operations of RFE/RL&#x27;s Kyrgyz Service.

In September 2023, RFE/RL&#x27;s Azerbaijani service, Radio Azadliq, was revealed to have a leadership with links to Azerbaijan’s ruling authorities, which censored content critical of the Azerbaijani government and instead published content that promoted the government&#x27;s agendas.

In February 2024, RFE was listed as an &#x27;undesirable organization&#x27; by Russia, effectively making it illegal in the country.

== Programs ==
=== &quot;49 Minutes of Jazz&quot;===
The program was a musical review by Dmitri Savitski from 1989 to 2004. The theme song of the program was &quot;So Tired&quot; by Bobby Timmons. The program was cancelled on April 10, 2004 due to &quot;the change of Liberty&#x27;s format&quot;.

<text>Captain Matthew Webb (19 January 1848 – 24 July 1883) was an English seaman, swimmer and stuntman who became the first person to swim the English Channel without the use of artificial aids. Webb increased the popularity of swimming in England.

Born in Dawley, Shropshire, Webb developed his swimming skills as a child while playing in the River Severn. At twelve, he began his career in the Merchant Navy after training at HMS &quot;Conway&quot;. After graduating, he began a three-year apprenticeship with the Rathbone Brothers of Liverpool, during which he sailed internationally across various trade routes to countries including China, India, Hong Kong, Singapore and Yemen.

After completing his second mate training in 1865, Webb worked for ten years aboard different ships and for multiple companies. He was recognised for two acts of bravery: in the Suez Canal, he freed the ship&#x27;s propeller from an entangling rope by diving underwater and cutting it, and in the Atlantic Ocean, he jumped in to attempt to save a man who had fallen overboard while the ship was travelling at . This latter act earned him the first Stanhope medal.

In 1875, on his second attempt, Webb gained fame by successfully swimming the English Channel from Dover, England, to Cap Gris-Nez, France. Public donations raised him £2,424 (about £ today), and he started a career as a professional swimmer. Webb competed in several races, and performed stunts in England and America, including completing a swim from Gravesend to Woolwich along the Thames in 1877, swimming over six days to win a long-distance swimming race in 1879, and floating for 128.5 hours at the Boston Horticultural Hall in 1882. Webb&#x27;s financial situation worsened, and in 1883 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, leaving him bedridden for two months. Webb died later that year after being paralysed by the water pressure while attempting to swim down the rapids at Niagara Gorge, below Niagara Falls.

==Early life==
Webb was born on 19 January 1848 in Dawley, Shropshire. He was one of 13 children of the surgeon Dr Matthew Webb. In 1849, when Webb was 14 months old, his family moved to Madeley, and then in 1856 to Coalbrookdale, where they lived near the River Severn.

Webb&#x27;s first memory involved the water. After school he would go with friends to play in the Severn, so by the age of seven he could swim. This was uncommon for the time, as swimming was not generally considered a pleasurable activity, but rather a medical treatment. At eight, Webb and his older brother Thomas saved his younger brother Charles from drowning. Webb enjoyed showing off in front of his friends and reading sea stories, with the book &quot;Old Jack&quot; by W. H. G. Kingston inspiring him to become a seaman.

==Career as a seaman==

In 1860, at twelve years old, Webb began training for the Merchant Navy aboard the HMS &quot;Conway&quot; training ship. Initially homesick and disliking the harsh conditions, Webb soon became popular on the &quot;Conway&quot; and earned the nickname &quot;Chummy Webb&quot;. The routine was regulated, but allowed time for play, and students studied both traditional subjects and nautical skills. Webb rescued a student who had fallen overboard. He impressed his peers by swimming for extended periods.

=== Apprenticeship with the Rathbone Brothers ===
In 1862, Webb began a three-year apprenticeship on eastern cargo ships operated by the Rathbone Brothers of Liverpool. He trained to become a second mate, earning £30 (about £ today) for his three years&#x27; work. His first voyage was from Liverpool to Calcutta. The crew faced bad weather that terrified Webb. Despite this, he excelled in the harsh conditions and was not prone to seasickness unlike the other new recruits. The ship then sailed to Hong Kong, Singapore, back to Calcutta and then back home. In Hong Kong, Webb fought off a mugging attempt until a policeman caused the assailants to flee.

His next trip was to Aden and then Bombay, where he spent three months and first swam in the sea. He swam between the boats in the harbour, dining at his destination and swimming back again. He enjoyed the extra buoyancy that the saltwater provided, and the roughness of the waves. Webb gained a reputation for fearlessness and was admired by his comrades. After his third voyage, he passed his second mate qualification.

===Work as a second mate and seaman===
Webb&#x27;s contract expired in 1865, after which he became a second mate for Saunders &amp; Co., another Liverpool-based shipping company. He worked on ships to Japan, Brazil and Egypt.

Webb was confident in his physical abilities, especially in swimming. He would leap off the yardarm into the sea, and earned an extra £1 per day for anchoring near a wreck, and then swimming back to shore—a job which the other sailors were too afraid to do. In one incident, he competed with a Newfoundland dog to see who could swim the longest in the rough sea. After an hour, Webb was still swimming but the dog had to be rescued from the water. In the Suez Canal, his ship&#x27;s propeller became tangled with a rope. Webb dived down repeatedly for hours, cutting the rope until the propeller was freed. Saunders &amp; Co. never acknowledged his efforts so he left for the United States.Disliking the US, Webb took a job as an ordinary seaman on the Cunard Line ship &quot;Russia&quot; to return to the UK. During the voyage, he attempted to rescue a man overboard by jumping into the cold mid-Atlantic Ocean while the ship was travelling at . During the 37 minutes before he was rescued, Webb nearly drowned. The man was never found, but the passengers of the &quot;Russia&quot; gave Webb a purse of gold and upon returning home, he learned that his attempted rescue had won him the first Stanhope Medal and made him a hero in the British press.

From 1865 to 1875, Webb worked on seven ships, the last being the &quot;Emerald&quot;, where he served as captain for six months.

==English Channel swimming record==
In mid-1872, Webb read an account of the failed attempt by J. B. Johnson to swim the English Channel, and became inspired to try.

===Channel training===
In 1874 Webb sought financial backers for his Channel attempt and other long swims. He approached Robert Watson, owner of the &quot;Swimming, Rowing and Athletic Record&quot; and &quot;Swimming Notes and Record&quot;, for support. Though Watson doubted Webb would attempt the channel, he advised him to wait until next summer for better weather. Webb agreed and moved to Dover to practice. Locals there nicknamed him the &quot;Red Indian&quot; as he would often come back from long swims with a red face. Before returning to Watson&#x27;s office on Fleet Street, he tested himself by swimming to the Varne Lightvessel and back again, a distance of .

Watson was surprised by Webb&#x27;s return and introduced him to Fred Beckwith, a coach at Lambeth Baths in south London. Watson and Beckwith arranged a secret trial of Webb, watching him swim breaststroke down the Thames from Westminster Bridge to Regent&#x27;s Canal Dock. After an hour and 20 minutes, they &quot;grew tired of watching his slow, methodical but perfect breaststroke&quot; and concluded his trial. For the rest of the 1874 swimming season, Webb trained daily at Lambeth Baths. He became close friends with Beckwith and Watson.
In June 1875 Webb left his job as captain of the &quot;Emerald&quot; to focus on swimming. That same month, future American rival Paul Boyton paddled across the Channel in a survival suit. Although Boyton used a suit, the public viewed them as rivals, forcing Webb to match the standards of endurance that Boyton set. Webb called Boyton &quot;an obvious fraud&quot;.

On 3 July Beckwith organised a spectacle with Webb attempting a swim from Blackwall to Gravesend along the River Thames, which he finished in 4 hours and 52 minutes. Although Webb gained media attention for the feat, low public interest on the rainy day meant Beckwith lost money. As a result, Webb hired a new manager, Arthur Payne, sporting editor of &quot;The Standard.&quot;

On 17 July Webb announced his attempt to swim the English Channel with a statement in &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot; and &quot;Land and Water&quot;:

Webb&#x27;s next swim was a 20-mile journey from Dover to Ramsgate. He hired a local boatman and invited a reporter from the &quot;Dover Chronicle&quot;. Despite heavy rain, he set off just before 10:00 with the tide in his favour. Webb alternated between breaststroke and sidestroke, finishing in eight hours and 40 minutes at Ramsgate Pier. The only newspaper to report was the &quot;Dover Chronicle&quot;.

After his long swims, Webb underwent a medical check in London, which was reported in the &quot;Land and Water&quot;. An employee there gave Webb a jar of porpoise oil for insulation, which he later used for his Channel swim.

In August Webb moved from London to the Flying Horse Inn in Dover to begin final preparations. He swam an hour daily, except every tenth day when he swam up to five hours.

===Channel swim===
Webb consulted locals about conditions in the Strait of Dover and chose to use Boyton&#x27;s strategy. He planned to start on the east flood tide and catch the current as it turned west. For support, he chose the lugger boat &quot;Ann&quot;, which was captained by George Toms. Webb did not want a doctor, since he believed he knew his health best.

====First attempt====

Webb waited for moderately good weather and began his first attempt on 12 August. According to Dolphin from the &quot;Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News&quot;, during the swim, he tried an early form of goggles without a seal, which he called &quot;barnacles&quot;, but they did not work. The weather worsened, and after seven hours he was over nine miles off course. He boarded the boat 15 minutes before the weather conditions would have prevented him doing so. Despite his disappointment, he remained positive and was assured by Toms that with better weather, he likely would have succeeded.

====Successful attempt====
Good weather arrived on 24 August with a good barometer reading, light wind and slightly overcast sky. The sea temperature was . Webb ate bacon and eggs with claret, then set off in the &quot;Ann&quot; from the Harbour to Admiralty Pier. Toms predicted the swim would take around 14 hours, while Captain Pittock of the &quot;Castalia—&quot;who was an expert on the Channel waters—estimated it would take around 20. At the time of his swim, Webb weighed , his chest size was and he was tall.

At 12:56 pm, Webb dived from the pier in his red silk swimming costume. He set off into the ebb tide which carried him for the first three-quarters of a mile. Webb was backed by the &quot;Ann&quot; and two smaller rowing boats operated by Charles Baker, who joined Webb in the water for parts of the swim, and John Graham Chambers. Aboard the &quot;Ann&quot; were: Toms and his crew, Webb&#x27;s brother-in-law George Ward, Payne (acting as a referee and reporter for the &quot;Land and Water&quot; and &quot;The Standard&quot;) and reporters from &quot;The Field&quot;, the &quot;Daily News&quot;, the &quot;Dover Express&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;Dover Chronicle&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, the &quot;Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News&quot; and &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;.
Webb started swimming breaststroke at 25 strokes per minute but soon slowed to 20. He consumed cod liver oil, beef tea, brandy, coffee and ale, but did not stop long for each feed to preserve body heat.

By 17:30, Dover could not be seen. At 20:35, Webb was stung painfully by a jellyfish, but he continued after a shot of brandy, and by 23:00, Toms believed they were over halfway. A mail boat named &quot;The Maid of Kent&quot; passed Webb, with passengers cheering.

For five hours, the currents off Cap Gris-Nez prevented him from reaching the shore, and he was visibly struggling. By 21:30, Webb had slowed to twelve strokes per minute, and the crew grew anxious. The &quot;Maid of Kent&quot; returned with a rowing boat containing eight people to shield Webb from the wind and rain, and the crew sang the tune &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;.After nearly 22 hours, at 10:41 am on 25 August, he landed near Calais. His zig-zag course across the Channel covered about . After finishing, he fell into his friends&#x27; arms, and slept in the Hotel de Paris.

===Reception===
After his swim, Webb had a temperature of and two long swellings on his neck. He slept almost continuously for 24 hours. After meeting the crowds at the hotel and touring a lace factory, Webb and George Ward boarded the flag-decorated &quot;Castalia&quot; for their return to England. Webb briefly went to the saloon but soon moved to the deck, where he was greeted by a cheering crowd.At Dover Harbour, a crowd eagerly awaited him. Webb, Toms and the crew boarded a carriage to the Flying Horse Inn. Webb soon grew tired of the crowd and tried to leave for his home in Wellington via train. The crowd accompanied him to the train station, while the song &quot;See the Conquering Hero Comes&quot; was played.

In Wellington, a crowd brought his carriage to Ironbridge, where the Mayor of Wenlock greeted him. The journey was lit by candles, torches and lanterns held by the residents. On Monday, he was met by a group from Dawley. They escorted him and his family down the High Street, where people welcomed him. Flowers lined his route, and the day ended with a bonfire and fireworks. When Webb visited the Baltic Exchange in London, workers stopped to cheer him. He accepted invitations to visit the Lord Mayor of London, receive an ovation at the Royal Cambridge Music Hall and have his portrait drawn.

Webb received gifts, including gold cuff links and collar studs, a gold watch and a North London Swimming Club gold cross. The London Stock Exchange established him a testimonial fund, which raised him £2,424 (£ today). Webb gave £500 to his father and invested £1,782 before moving to Kensington, London. For the rest of 1875, Webb spoke at boys&#x27; schools, including the &quot;Conway&quot;, where he was used as an example of English virtues.

Several newspapers reported on Webb. &quot;The Standard&quot; published Payne&#x27;s account of the crossing, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; interviewed Webb. Surgeon Sir William Fergusson called Webb&#x27;s feat &quot;almost unrivalled as an instance of human prowess and endurance&quot;, and noted his body&#x27;s likely ability for vasoconstriction to prevent heat loss. It was suggested in parliament that Webb be knighted, with Richard Henry Horne being Webb&#x27;s strongest advocate, but it never happened.

It took 36 years for anyone else to swim the channel, accomplished by Thomas Burgess in 1911. After Burgess completed the crossing, Webb&#x27;s widow was interviewed. She was pleased that Burgess had succeeded, as it demonstrated the crossing was possible and would silence those who doubted Webb&#x27;s achievement. Since then, the channel has been crossed by over 2500 swimmers.

==Swimming career==
After his record swim, Webb received recognition internationally and pursued a career as a professional swimmer.

He began lecturing on his career and swimming-related topics, where he opposed the common Victorian practice of forcefully dunking children, suggesting instead they learn by experimenting for themselves in shallow water. He also licensed his name for merchandise, including commemorative pottery and matches. Webb also wrote a book titled &quot;The Art of Swimming&quot;, though this was mostly written by Payne.

In August 1876, Webb accompanied Frederick Cavill on his first channel attempt, but it ended after Cavill drank a lot of whisky and was stung by jellyfish. In &quot;Land and Water&quot;, Webb stated Cavill had only made it halfway, which angered him. After Cavill&#x27;s second attempt, he claimed to have finished nearly ten hours faster than Webb. This claim was quickly discredited when one of the witnesses was found to be fictitious. Cavill continued to taunt Webb for years.

=== Early exhibition swims ===
Webb did not make much money, but lived a high-cost lifestyle and was generous. In 1877, he bet £100 (about £ today) at 20-to-1 odds that he could swim from Gravesend to Woolwich along the Thames. He completed the 40-mile swim which broke the record for the longest freshwater swim, and earned publicity from &quot;The Times&quot;. The record stood until 1899 when it was beaten by Montague Holbein.

By 1879, Webb was in financial trouble. To raise funds, he entered a long-distance swimming race organised by Beckwith. The swimmers were tasked with swimming as far as possible over six days. The race was a moderate success for Beckwith, and Webb won the £70 prize. He swam , averaging 14 hours per day.

=== Travel to America ===
Webb was attracting less attention, so in 1880 he went to America. He found a new manager, Captain Henry Hartley, who arranged for The Manhattan Beach Company to wager $1,000 (about $ today) on a ten-mile swim from Sandy Hook to Manhattan Beach. Webb was required to enter Manhattan Beach Harbour between 17:00 and 18:00 to ensure the largest possible audience. Despite his crew&#x27;s inexperience and Webb arriving three hours early, he finished the swim and fulfilled his contract. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the feat impressive but useless.

On 22 August, Paul Boyton and Webb raced at Newport beach, each wagering $1,000, and James Bennett (Newport casino owner) added another $1,000 to the prize pool. Two white buoys were placed half a mile apart; Webb was tasked with swimming around them 20 times in regular trunks, while Boyton completed 25 laps in his suit. A large crowd gathered on the beach, and Boyton took an early lead. Webb suffered a cramp that ended his race, while Boyton paddled to the finish.

Webb challenged Boyton to a rematch, which he accepted. The race took place at Nantasket Beach, and was promoted as the &quot;Championship of the World&quot;. Public interest was higher, with a prize pool of $4,000 (about $ today). Boyton had to paddle between three buoys, and Webb between two. After several postponements, the race was held on 6 September. The details of the race are unclear, but the referee refused to declare a winner and later accused Webb of cheating by swimming to shore and running across the beach. Webb denied the accusation, and it was revealed that the referee was Boyton&#x27;s fiancée&#x27;s father. Boyton challenged Webb again in a letter to the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, offering greater odds, but Webb did not respond.

Webb&#x27;s next race was against Ernest Von Schoening, who defeated him in the &quot;Endurance Championship of the World&quot; on 14 September. Webb left the water after swimming , and Hartley later said he had felt cramps coming on.

Overall, Webb was unsuccessful in America and lost money on the trip. On 27 April 1880, Webb and Madeleine Kate Chaddock married at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, West Kensington, and they later had two children, Matthew and Helen.

===Deteriorating health===
Webb&#x27;s next endeavour was floating for 60 hours in the Royal Aquarium in Westminster. Members of the public were distracted by other attractions, and few paid attention to him. He followed this with a 74-hour float at Scarborough Aquarium, which also received little public attention. In 1881, Webb&#x27;s friend Frank Buckland from the &quot;Land and Water&quot; died, and Webb fell ill. Nevertheless, he continued swimming, participating in another six-day race at Lambeth Baths and a race against Willie Beckwith. 
Webb&#x27;s health worsened when he raced Dr. G. A. Jennings at Hollingworth Lake. Although Webb had trained in the cold water, and was nearly twice as fast as Jennings, the water caused him to hallucinate and become disorientated. With twelve minutes remaining, Webb lost his direction and with 30 seconds left, he climbed out of the water. He vomited and was assisted by Baker and Watson in returning to normal body temperature.

He returned to America in 1882, where he won a race against railroad engineer George Wade at Brighton Beach, and another 5-mile race against 22 swimmers at Nantasket Beach. Both events were poorly organised and recognised as sporting events. He floated for 128.5 hours (minus a 94-minute break) in Boston Horticultural Hall, attracting more attention than his previous floating exhibits in England;, but his financial situation remained poor.

Webb&#x27;s last competitive swim was in March 1883, when he raced at Lambeth Baths against Willie Beckwith. He withdrew from the race after coughing up blood due to tuberculosis. By this time, Webb had lost since swimming the Channel.

For the next two months, Webb was bedridden. His brother, now Dr Thomas Webb, urged him to give up long-distance swimming for his health. Webb made one final public appearance to ceremonially start a race at Battersea Baths.

==Death==
In 1882, Webb announced his intent to swim through the Whirlpool Rapids below Niagara Falls. In June 1883, he and his family returned to America. Fred Beckwith and Watson tried to dissuade him, with Watson later saying:
Webb rented a cottage and trained for a month at Nantasket Beach. He wrote a will leaving his property to his Madeleine. He hired a new manager, Frederick Kyle, and travelled with him to Niagara on 23 July. The &quot;Niagara Falls Gazette&quot; announced Webb would start his swim at 16:00 that day. Railway companies, charging visitors to watch, promised him earnings, which he estimated at $10,000. The boat operator made a final attempt to dissuade him, but Webb only said &quot;goodbye boy&quot;, before exiting the boat.

The first part went smoothly, but upon being lifted by a large wave, Webb shouted and raised his arm, before being pulled underwater for about . He briefly resurfaced several times, but was sucked into the whirlpool and never seen alive again.

After Webb went missing, Kyle speculated he had likely ended up downstream, while others suggested suicide. The next day at noon, Kyle sent Madeleine a telegram with the news, and at 22:00 he stopped the search for Webb alive, offering a $100 reward for Webb&#x27;s body. Rumours spread that Madeleine inherited a large sum, but Kyle told the public that Webb had left it to his children.

Four days later, Webb&#x27;s body was found. The autopsy revealed that he died from paralysis caused by water pressure, leading to respiratory failure.

Webb was buried in Oakwood Cemetery. Many of Webb&#x27;s friends organised an ornamental swimming event at Lambeth Baths in his honour. The &quot;Land and Water&quot; criticized the risks Webb had taken later in life, and &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot; blamed the railway companies for his death.

Webb&#x27;s widow reburied Webb in Oakwood Cemetery with another funeral. A dark granite Gothic monument was placed above the grave, inscribed &quot;Captain Matthew Webb. Born Jan. 19, 1848. Died July 24, 1883&quot;.

==Legacy==
Webb wanted to inspire more people to learn to swim, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; said he had had a positive impact by inspiring the country to swim. In 1909, Webb&#x27;s elder brother Thomas unveiled a memorial, funded by public donations, at the east end of Dawley High Street. It bears the inscription: &quot;Nothing great is easy.&quot; Webb has another memorial in Dover and one at Coalbrookdale. Webb Crescent and Captain Webb Primary School in Dawley are named after him, as is Webb House of the Haberdashers&#x27; Adams Grammar School in Newport, Shropshire. In 1965, Webb was added to the International Swimming Hall of Fame for being the first person to cross the English Channel.His death inspired a poem by William McGonagall in 1883, and John Betjeman&#x27;s poem &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. A film adaptation of Webb&#x27;s Channel attempt, directed by Justin Hardy, written by Jemma Kennedy, and starring Warren Brown, was released in 2015 under the title &quot;Captain Webb&quot;.

<text>Thomas of Celano (; c. 1185 – c. 1265) was an Italian friar of the Franciscans (Order of Friars Minor) as well as a poet and the author of three hagiographies about Francis of Assisi.

==Life==
Thomas was born sometime between 1185 and 1190, into the noble family of the Conti dei Marsi at Celano in the Province of the Abruzzi. He received a sound liberal arts education, possibly at the Benedictine monastery of Saint John the Baptist near Celano. His familiarity with monastic tradition suggests that he may have studied at Monte Cassino, Rome or Bologna.

He joined the Franciscan order probably in 1215. In 1221, he was present at the Pentecost Chapter at the Portiuncula, and then accompanied Caesar of Speyer on his mission to Germany. The following year he became custos of the convents at Mayence, Worms, Speyer, and Cologne, and soon after, Caesar of Speyer, on his return to Italy, made him his vicar in the government of the German province. Before September 1223, Thomas returned to Italy, and lived there in close contact with Francis.

==Works==

* &quot;Vita Prima&quot;: Soon after the canonization of Francis in 1228, Pope Gregory IX commissioned Thomas to write the &quot;Vita Beati Francisci&quot; (&quot;The Life of Blessed Francis&quot;; often called the &quot;First Life&quot;), a work on the saint&#x27;s early life.

* &quot;Vita Secunda&quot;: A supplement, the &quot;Memoriale Desiderio Animae de Gestis et Verbis Sanctissimi Patris Nostri Francisci&quot; (&quot;The Memorial of the Desire of a Soul Concerning the Deeds and Words of Our Most Holy Father Francis&quot; often just called the &quot;Second Life&quot;) was commissioned by Crescentius of Jessi, the Minister General of the Franciscan Order sometime between 1244 and 1247, and reflects changing official perspectives on Francis in the decades after his death. 

* The third is a treatise on the saint&#x27;s miracles, written sometime between around 1254 and 1257 at the bidding of Blessed John of Parma, who succeeded Crescentius as Minister General.

Thomas&#x27;s authorship of the three works on Francis of Assisi is well-established. Many researchers of the early history of the Franciscan order believe that Brother Leo, and Rufinus of Assisi, associates of Francis, were the source of the material for the &quot;Vita Secunda&quot;. 

Thomas also wrote &quot;Fregit victor virtualis&quot; and &quot;Sanctitatis nova signa&quot; in honor of Francis. &quot;Life of St. Clare of Assisi&quot;, on the early life of Saint Clare of Assisi, and the hymn &quot;Dies Irae&quot; are also traditionally attributed to him, but the authorship of both works is in fact uncertain.

===Death and burial===
In 1260 he settled down to his last post, as spiritual director to a convent of Clarisses in Tagliacozzo, where he died some time between 1260 and 1270.

He was at first buried in the church of S. Giovanni Val dei Varri, attached to his monastery, but his body is now reburied in the church of S. Francesco at Tagliacozzo.

==Beatification process==
The process for beatification was initiated in Avezzano; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints declared the process valid and allowed for the opening of the so-called &quot;Roman Phase&quot; on 27 November 1991. The initiation of the process prior to this date granted him the title Servant of God.

<doc id="184411" wikidata="Q2279868" url="?curid=184411" title="The Sims Online">
<text>The Sims Online was a 2002 massively multiplayer online game (MMO) developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts (EA) for Microsoft Windows. The game was a subscription-based online multiplayer version of the 2000 Maxis game &quot;The Sims&quot;, in which players could interact with others on virtual user-made lots, buy and customise properties, and make in-game money by taking on jobs. &quot;The Sims Online&quot; was the project of Maxis founder and &quot;Sims&quot; creator Will Wright, who sought to create an open-ended online game based on social interaction, with ambitions for the game to be a platform for emergent gameplay and the creation of virtual societies and politics. In line with these ambitions and the prior commercial success of &quot;The Sims&quot;, &quot;The Sims Online&quot; received considerable pre-release coverage, with expectations that it would be successful and break new ground for online multiplayer games. 

Released following a two-month public beta, &quot;The Sims Online&quot; was met with mixed reviews from critics. Reviewers generally praised the game&#x27;s social features, but found the game to lack the depth and appeal of &quot;The Sims&quot;, with many describing it as similar to a chat room. The overemphasis of jobs and money-making in the game was particularly critiqued due to the limited, repetitive and time-consuming nature of these activities in overall gameplay. The game similarly fared poorly commercially, underperforming press, industry and publisher expectations for the success of the game. The game also courted controversy, with its open-ended approach to social interaction leading to organised player harassment and simulated cybersex. The player count of &quot;The Sims Online&quot; peaked at slightly over 100,000 players in 2003, a modest number compared to other popular multiplayer games of the time. In March 2007, EA announced that the product would be re-branded as EA-Land, introducing several major enhancements to the game. Within several weeks, EA announced the game would shut down, and closed the servers on August 1, 2008. &quot;The Sims Online&quot; has retrospectively been viewed as a failed experiment, with its failure attributed to its limited features, repetitive gameplay and subscription fee. A free fan-made reimplementation of &quot;The Sims Online&quot;, titled &quot;FreeSO&quot;, was available from 2017 to 2024. 

== Gameplay ==

Similar to &quot;The Sims&quot;, &quot;The Sims Online&quot; is an open-ended game that allows players to create and control virtual people, named Sims, with other player and non-player characters, in a virtual neighborhood where they can make money to buy objects and build homes and venues to live in and to interact with other Sims. 

=== Sim and neighborhood setup ===

Players setup the game by selecting a city and creating a sim. Cities represent persistent servers with different players; each player may have one sim per city with a total of three sims. Creating a sim is similar to &quot;The Sims&quot;, with control over name, gender, and appearance. Once the sim is created, a player enters the city view of the selected city, divided into neighborhoods which feature a grid of properties. Players can use a search, browser and map filters to locate existing properties, including by attributes including their popularity and category. As in &quot;The Sims&quot;, players are required to manage their sim&#x27;s needs whilst on a lot by keeping their eight individual motive levels high, which include hunger, comfort, hygiene, bladder, energy, fun, social, and room. &quot;The Sims Online&quot; features a similar skill progression system to &quot;The Sims&quot;, with some modifications. Skills improve players&#x27; ability to generate an income using skill objects. Skill progression is accelerated by the number of people progressing the same skill at the same time in a lot. Skills also degrade over time based on the total number of skill points earned.

=== Social interaction ===

&quot;The Sims Online&quot; integrates social features that allow players to interact with others. Players can search, bookmark, and locate other players in their neighborhood by name in the city view. This view also provides a top 100 list of the most successful sims and properties in the neighborhood by various categories. The relationships between players are visually depicted in a friendship web, which depicts the player&#x27;s network of friends, enemies and acquaintances. These statuses are manually set by players.

Relationships are indirectly measured by a relationship score that increases and decreases along with the daily and lifetime interactions a player has with another. Players have also several modes of social interaction inside and outside of properties. Messages can be sent through the user interface to specific players, which turns into a real-time chat if both players are online. If both players are on the same property, they can interact using an open text chat creating speech bubbles to nearby players. Players can also select animated gestures and interactions, with more earned by progressing skills above a certain level or having a higher relationship score. Some gestures and interactions are mutual and require both players to accept before proceeding. Players can manage unwanted behaviour by ignoring the player, removing their text in chat, or banning them from the lot if owned by the player.

=== Making money and managing property ===

Simoleans are the main commodity in &quot;The Sims Online&quot;, used to purchase lots and objects and design buildings. There are several other sources of income for players. Passive sources of income include a daily &#x27;visitor bonus&#x27; based on the number of minutes that visitors spend in the lot, and an &#x27;achievement bonus&#x27; for being on the game&#x27;s top ranking lists. Players with properties also can set several items that allow others to pay them an income, including tip jars, fees for vending machines and pay-to-enter doors. The primary source of income for players is using job objects, some job objects produce items of value accumulated at a rate based on the player&#x27;s skill level and number of other players simultaneously producing items which can be traded or sold for a profit. These objects are based upon a single skill requirement. Other job objects require multiple players to participate, and feature minigames with a payout based on the efficiency of the players, including games to navigate mazes, guess the correct letters in a code, and create a pizza with the largest variation in ingredients. These objects often have multiple skill requirements at different levels, requiring players to find others with compatible skills.

Players purchase and manage properties in a different manner to &quot;The Sims&quot;. Players select a vacant lot located in a neighborhood, with property values affected by the location and size. Players that own a property can invite roommates to inhabit them. Roommates have the ability to add or remove their own objects and manage visitors, but can&#x27;t manage the inhabitants or the size of the property. The owner&#x27;s user interface provides additional pages that allow them to manage inhabitants, such as lists of admitted and banned users. Property pages in the game&#x27;s city view provide key information of a property, including its residents and property type.

== Development and release ==

=== Development and release ===

&quot;The Sims Online&quot; was conceived by Maxis lead designer and creator of &quot;The Sims&quot;, Will Wright, who envisioned future games would be online as the &quot;norm rather than the exception&quot;, and proposed the concept of an online &quot;Sims&quot; game to Maxis in 2000. Delivering a keynote speech at the 2001 Game Developers Conference, Wright revealed initial concepts and screenshots for &quot;The Sims Online&quot;, outlining an aim for the game to imitate and represent real-life social networks as &quot;an interactive exploration of the emerging social web&quot; and based upon the &quot;social topography&quot; created and explored by players. Wright also attributed conversations with author Neal Stephenson and his 1992 novel &quot;Snow Crash&quot; as inspiration for the game, with its notion of a metaverse also emerging as a comparison point for publishers and reviewers. To reinforce the idea of an open-ended virtual environment, Wright conceived the game would be &quot;thematically empty&quot; upon release, with its settings and social dynamics to be created by players with minimal guidance from the game.

To realise Wright&#x27;s concept, the development team aimed to create an online game with &quot;The Sims&quot; engine that encouraged interaction between players, and provide a broader business and economic simulation built from this premise. Initially pitched as a smaller matchmaking client where players could visit each other&#x27;s houses, suggestions by EA and Maxis to focus the game on a subscription model led to development of a larger online game. The team, which initially had little to no experience creating massively multiplayer online games, encountered challenges and delays in creating and scaling tools and processes from a game originally intended as a single-player experience. &quot;Ultima Online&quot; developer Gordon Walton joined Maxis to provide experience on designing online games. The team also featured a larger representation of women for the time reflecting the majority female audience of &quot;The Sims&quot; franchise, commended by the ELSPA as a &quot;success story&quot; for the female games industry workforce. The undisclosed development budget for &quot;The Sims Online&quot; was estimated by industry insiders to be $25 million. EA announced the release of a public beta in October 2002. 

Prior to release, &quot;The Sims Online&quot; received significant pre-release coverage and high expectations as a potential commercial and cultural phenomenon, following the showcase of the game at E3 in May 2002. Featured as a cover article on &quot;Newsweek&quot;, the game was hailed as a &quot;step forward for online games&quot; and an emerging &quot;forum for social interaction&quot;. Lev Grossman of &quot;Time&quot; described the upcoming title as a &quot;daring collective social experiment&quot; to simulate a &quot;vast virtual society&quot; and &quot;sandbox where we can play out our fantasies and confront our fears about what America might become&quot;. Some noted the novelty of an MMO that did not feature a fantasy theme in contrast to popular MMO games of the time, including &quot;EverQuest&quot; and &quot;Ultima Online&quot;, with speculation that its general appeal could &quot;bring multiplayer online gaming to the masses&quot;. Others expressed caution about the game&#x27;s high expectations, with Chris Morris of CNN noting the commercial risk due to the poor performance of previous EA online games &quot;Motor City Online&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot;, and the &quot;looming question of whether casual gamers will be willing to pay a monthly fee&quot;. &quot;The Sims Online&quot; was launched on 17 December 2002 to coincide with the Christmas period. The release was accompanied by a kitsch-themed launch party organized by EA and held in New York at the Altman Building.

=== Controversy === 

&quot;The Sims Online&quot; was subject to controversy due to the behaviors of some of its user base, prompting commentary on whether these behaviours consisted of virtual crime. Many critics noted the unexpected adult behavior of the game at release, with critics observing the game had a &quot;sleazy&quot; and &quot;off-color&quot; tone due to the risqué theme of the franchise, and commonly encountered flirting, sex, and users operating virtual brothels offering sex in exchange for simoleons. This had not been entirely unexpected; Wright had previously stated the developers were &quot;counting on&quot; players to create &quot;bordellos and whatever else they can imagine&quot; with the game&#x27;s open-ended tools. Players also discovered that the relationship system could be abused by threatening to label the reputation of others as untrustworthy, with cases spanning from targeted harassment to widespread, co-ordinated efforts by a Mafia of players who would extort victims and properties.

Public attention was further brought to these issues by Peter Ludlow, a University of Michigan philosophy professor, who operated an online blog titled &quot;The Alphaville Herald&quot; that frequently canvassed the activities of the inhabitants on the server of the same name. Under the pseudonym Urizenus, Ludlow observed, wrote about, and interviewed users engaging in practices including scams, sadomasochism, prostitution, and organised crime. Of particular concern was a reported griefer, Evangeline, who claimed to be a seventeen-year-old male who operated a brothel offering virtual sex services in the game. Ludlow, among other academics, noted the ethical grey area of these activities, although the potential of &quot;real money&quot; being exchanged for simoleons opened up issues around the &quot;exploitation&quot; of users. Ludlow&#x27;s account on &quot;The Sims Online&quot; was banned by EA on the basis that he had included a link to his website in his player profile, raising mainstream commentary on the merits of Ludlow&#x27;s reporting, the potential harms of virtual crime, and the adequacy of moderation in the game.

Following release, the development team used surveys, feedback and demographic studies on the player base to plan a growth strategy for the game, aiming to provide more specific goals and activities, enhance the social aspects of the game, and integrating more features from &quot;The Sims&quot; into the game. Initial features added by the development team included clothing racks to customise outfits, a player trading feature, non-player characters that provide services, and pets from &quot;The Sims Unleashed&quot;; however, the introduction of the clothing rack also introduced an exploit into the game that allowed players to generate large amounts of money. Despite being fixed, the exploit led to hyperinflation and permanently impacted the game&#x27;s virtual economy.

In February 2008, EA announced that &quot;The Sims Online&quot; would be relaunched as a free-to-play reworked version titled &quot;EA-Land&quot;. The launch was the product of ongoing development from a small development team led by EA studio head Luc Barthelet from 2007 under the initial name TSO-E, designed as a single, merged city. As part of this process, several features were introduced into the game, including the introduction of the ability for players to upload custom content into the game, and the integration of web and social media features, including Facebook apps and user-created widgets. The relaunch announcement was met with an unenthusiastic reception; Jim Rossignol of &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; described the relaunch as &quot;horribly rebranded&quot; and &quot;buzzwordery&quot;, and &quot;Eurogamer&quot; didn&#x27;t &quot;understand any of it&quot;.

=== Closure ===

On 29 April 2008, weeks after the relaunch of the game, EA announced the &quot;EA-Land&quot; service would be shut down from 1 August. The announcement was met with disappointment from users, with Barthelet noting the difficult and &quot;particularly complex&quot; reasons for ending the service weeks after relaunch. &quot;EA-Land&quot; shut down at 4:35am PST on 1 August 2008. To commemorate the closure, EA developers held a &#x27;See You Soon&#x27; party where players congregated until the shutdown of the game. The final moments of the game at this party were recorded by Henry Lowood&#x27;s research team as part of &quot;Archiving Virtual Worlds&quot; and &quot;Preserving Virtual Worlds&quot;, two Congress-funded projects to investigate and develop measures to archive software content.

== Reception ==

=== Sales ===

&quot;The Sims Online&quot; was a commercial disappointment, peaking in sixth place in United States PC sales charts in December 2002. At launch, the game sold 105,000 units, a quarter of its production shipment. By early 2003, the game was reported as having between 80,000 and 85,000 subscribers at launch, 40,000 of whom remained on a free trial. Citing an &quot;error on expectations&quot; for sales, EA immediately dropped the retail price of the game from $49.99 to $29.99. The subscription base, which remained under 100,000 for most of 2003, underperformed industry expectations, and fell short of EA goals of reaching 200,000 by March and 400,000 subscribers by the end of the year. Analyst Bruce Woodcock estimated active player subscriptions for &quot;The Sims Online&quot; peaked near 105,000 in 2003, sharply declining in the years after.

=== Reviews ===

&quot;The Sims Online&quot; received &quot;mixed to average&quot; review scores according to review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers generally praised the social networking features of the game, with several comparing it to the functionality of a chat room. Describing the game as a &quot;chat room come to life&#x27;, Michael Lafferty of &quot;GameZone&quot; considered the interactive social gameplay to be a highlight of &quot;The Sims Online&quot; due to the diversity of the player base. A. A. White of &quot;Game Revolution&quot; commended the &quot;realized&quot; and &quot;excellent&quot; integration of in-game instant messaging and email. Jessica Theon of &quot;Computer Games&quot; praised the game&#x27;s design and social features in encouraging player co-operation, although she found the map and search function making it difficult to navigate to find others. &quot;Game Informer&quot; enjoyed the communal aspect of the game, but wished there were more gameplay options than &quot;mindless genial interaction&quot;. Scott Steinberg of &quot;PC Zone&quot; highlighted the game&#x27;s &quot;unique approach to massive online play&quot; and focus of the game mechanics to &quot;bring people together&quot;, but found the lack of a chat log made it difficult to monitor and continue conversations. Several critics also discussed the negative aspects of player interaction. Steve Butts of &quot;IGN&quot; noted the gameplay was open to &quot;confusion&quot; and &quot;abuse&quot;, observing easy ways to exploit the property manager system. Dana Jongewaard of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; found players were generally unwilling to interact in gameplay and were primarily focused on making money. In contrast, Jessica Theon of &quot;Computer Games&quot; found players to be &quot;incredibly friendly and helpful&quot;.

Many critics questioned the merits of the game&#x27;s changes compared to &quot;The Sims&quot;. Steve Butts of &quot;IGN&quot; noted the gameplay lacked &quot;challenge and conflict&quot; due to the individual focus of gameplay and less scripted nature of other players. T. J. Deci of &quot;Allgame&quot; considered the social mechanics to detract from the appeal of &quot;The Sims&quot;, citing the lack of player customisation to differentiate players. Dana Jongewaard of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; noted the design of &quot;The Sims Online&quot; omitted large aspects of the original game, including its events, careers, and special characters. A. A. White of &quot;Game Revolution&quot; noted the game&#x27;s greater emphasis on collective activities was effective, but reduced the uniqueness of individual sims, their interests and personality traits. Scott Steinberg of &quot;PC Zone&quot; lamented the absence of the &quot;little details&quot; from &quot;The Sims&quot;, such as disasters.

The game&#x27;s business simulation mechanics were also critiqued. Steve Butts of &quot;IGN&quot; noted that the lack of a &quot;player-run market of commodities and items&quot; limited the incentive of focusing on the money-making aspects of the game. &quot;GameSpot&quot; similarly cited the functionality of the economy as a problem for the game, finding skill building and money making activities to be limited and repetitive. A. A. White of &quot;Game Revolution&quot; found the money-making activities generic, &quot;non-interactive&quot;, and limited in progression, leading to an &quot;intense emphasis on drudgery&quot; and the proliferation of &quot;sweatshop&quot; lots on the game to facilitate money-making. Carla Harker of &quot;GameSpy&quot; similarly described them as a &quot;boring&quot;, &quot;time-consuming&quot;, and &quot;repetitive chore&quot;. Describing money as the &quot;downfall of the game&quot;, Scott Steinberg of &quot;PC Zone&quot; noted the job objects to dominant player participation and interaction, stating &quot;the emphasis on cash and beauty leaves the game unbalanced, offering little reward to the player who wants to pursue a different path&quot;.

=== Retrospective reception ===

Initial post-release reception of &quot;The Sims Online&quot; evaluated the game as falling far below the cultural, commercial and critical impact of &quot;The Sims&quot;, with some labelling the game as a failure. Early assessments from analysts suggested the game&#x27;s disappointing performance arose from a late December release too close to Christmas, poor reviews, and a limited time from announcement to release to generate support for a subscription service. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; assessed that whilst the game was meant to be a &quot;breakthrough&quot; game, &quot;players stayed away in droves&quot;. Several authors categorized &quot;The Sims Online&quot; as part of a trend of failed launches of massively multiplayer online games in the early millennium. 

Many writers attempted to assess the reasons for the underperformance of &quot;The Sims Online&quot;. Henry Jenkins and Kurt Squire of &quot;Computer Games&quot; cited the game&#x27;s difficulties in attracting a &quot;diverse player base&quot; and &quot;role-playing and storytelling community&quot; due to the medium of a massively multiplayer online game being &quot;expensive&quot; and &quot;time-intensive&quot; for players to maintain. Dan Whitehead of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; wrote that the mixture of pre-broadband performance issues and lack of infrastructure failed to &quot;support the infinitely malleable persistent virtual world &quot;The Sims&quot; required&quot;. Describing the game as an &quot;imperfect&quot; transition of &quot;The Sims&quot;, Steen et al. attributed the underperformance of the game to the &quot;disassociation&quot; between the idea of the player as an avatar and the dissatisfying social and economic gameplay mechanics that dominated the online experience, creating a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on natural social interaction. Dan Morris of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; stated the game needed a &quot;well-defined narrative, not just a sandbox&quot;. Graham Smith of &quot;Rock Paper Shotgun&quot; described the game as a &quot;mess&quot;, citing the vulnerability of its player-driven economy to bugs and the unscrupulous nature of players. Leah Williams of &quot;Kotaku&quot; noted the game was a &quot;bold experiment&quot; with a sound concept, but &quot;faded quickly&quot; due to the newness of the internet, the lack of players and available features, and constant development changes. Describing the game as a &quot;letdown&quot;, video game historian Phil Salvador assessed that whilst the concept &quot;should have worked&quot;, the game&#x27;s economic features were &quot;a constant grind&quot; with &quot;non-existent&quot; entertainment venues, but noted that &quot;its communal work interactions anticipated the sort of social games that are popular today&quot;.

== Legacy == 

Developers of &quot;The Sims Online&quot; retrospectively shared views that the game was a disappointment. Will Wright believes that the game&#x27;s lack of success was due to the online subscription model not fitting with &quot;The Sims&quot;″ core audience. He has observed that &quot;Online&quot; was &quot;a very different game&quot;, and that many of the constraints of the game came from the limitations of creating a multiplayer online game. Executive producer Gordon Walton stated that the game was not shipped with the complete features envisioned by the development team due to time constraints, writing &quot;not having a fully functioning economy and more fun activities ... made the game less appealing than we wanted&quot;. Although later added in &quot;EA-Land&quot;, &quot;The Sims&quot; developer Don Hopkins considered the initial lack of support for player-created content was also a major factor in the game&#x27;s failure. Associate producer Jessica Lewis speculated the game&#x27;s higher price and subscription fee at launch deterred some consumers, who could purchase expansion packs for &quot;The Sims&quot; for cheaper. &quot;The Sims 2&quot;, a single-player title and sequel to &quot;The Sims&quot;, was developed by Maxis and published by EA in 2004. &quot;Sims 2&quot; producer Tim LeTourneau assessed that &quot;The Sims Online&quot; was &quot;ahead of its time&quot; even though it &quot;never resonated as strongly as the regular &quot;Sims&quot; game did&quot;.

&quot;The Sims Online&quot; frequently arose in discussions about online integration in future &quot;Sims&quot; titles, with journalists noting the failure of the game suggested the unpopularity of the concept. &quot;The Sims Online&quot; was also noted to foreshadow later business practices by EA to increase online integration and monetization of the &quot;Sims&quot; franchise. In 2011, EA published the online game &quot;The Sims Social&quot; on Facebook, which featured similar social networking features on the platform. Following negative feedback to the online integration of the 2013 title &quot;SimCity&quot;, EA announced &quot;The Sims 4&quot; would be &quot;an offline, client-based game&quot;. In discussing the future direction of the &quot;Sims&quot; franchise in 2020, EA CEO Andrew Wilson noted &quot;The Sims Online&quot; had been influential in the studio&#x27;s approach to considering how &quot;social interactions and competitive elements&quot; could be integrated into the gameplay experience for future &quot;Sims&quot; titles. 

=== FreeSO ===

&quot;FreeSO&quot;, a free fan-made recreation of &quot;The Sims Online&quot; created by developer Rhys Simpson in C# and MonoGame, was launched in open beta on 6 January 2017. The game is a non-commercial, legal re-implementation of &quot;The Sims Online&quot;, acting as a client to read the game&#x27;s original assets, and has been approved by EA. Simpson had developed the game from July 2016, seeking to &quot;recapture the feeling&quot; of &quot;The Sims Online&quot;. Initially featuring a shared area named Sunrise Crater that accommodated 200 users, demand for the beta was so high that the servers crashed under a load of 1,000 accounts.

FreeSO was shut down in December 2024 after being online for nearly eight years.

<doc id="184412" wikidata="Q543887" url="?curid=184412" title="Lockheed Model 9 Orion">
<text>The Lockheed Model 9 Orion is a single-engined passenger aircraft built in 1931 for commercial airlines. It was faster than any American military aircraft of that time. Designed by Richard A. von Hake, it was the last wood aircraft produced by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.

==Design==
The Orion was the last design using many identical elements from the Lockheed designs preceding it. It primarily used all the elements of the Altair, but included a forward top cockpit similar to the Vega, plus the NACA cowling introduced in the Air Express. Lockheed used the same basic fuselage mold and wing for all these wooden designs (the Explorer wing was unique), hence the close similarities between them. The Orion featured an enclosed cabin with seating for six passengers. The Orion received its Approved Type Certificate on 6 May 1931.

Gerard F. Vultee was Lockheed&#x27;s chief engineer in 1928 through 1931 and was involved in the designs of all the Lockheed variants of that time and specifically designed Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s Sirius.

==Operational history==
Although designed with the passenger market in mind, its speed made it a natural for air races. The first Bendix race of 1931 had a showing of two Orions, three Altairs and one Vega in a race that had only nine aircraft competing. On 11 July 1935, Laura H. Ingalls flew a Lockheed Orion, powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp engine, from Floyd Bennett Field to Burbank, California, establishing an East-West record for women. Two months later she flew it back to set a West-East record.

The first Orion entered service with Bowen Air Lines at Fort Worth, Texas, in . Northwest Airways, later renamed to Northwest Airlines, operated the plane from 1933 to 1935. American Airways, itself also renamed to American Airlines in 1934, operated several 9D Orions. Many safe miles were flown in airline service and the headlines won by a few expert speed pilots proved the advanced design and reliability of the Orion. Those that went into airline use as a passenger transport had their lifespan limited, however. In 1934, the Civil Aeronautics Authority issued a ruling prohibiting further use of single-engined passenger aircraft from operating on all major networks. It also became mandatory to have a copilot and therefore a two-seat cockpit arrangement on all such flights. The requirements of the ruling brought an end to the &quot;Orion&quot; as a passenger-carrying airlines airplane. They were then used for cargo or mail carrying or sold for private use and charter. Because the aircraft had a complicated wood construction and needed to be sent back to Lockheed in Burbank California to be repaired, they were often disposed of after any type of significant accident. At least 12 of the used &quot;Orions&quot; were purchased for service in the Spanish Civil War and destroyed in use.

In 1935, a single Model 9 Orion was modified by Lockheed as a news camera plane for the Detroit News. To work in the role, a pod was built into the front leading edge of the right wing about eight feet out from the fuselage. This pod had a glass dome on the front and mounted a camera. To aim the camera the pilot was provided with a primitive grid similar to a gunsight on his windshield.

The Orion Explorer was a modified 9E. It had a damaged wing replaced with the wing of the Explorer 7 after a crash, and was fitted with a Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp S3H1 engine. Fixed landing gear and later floats were also fitted. It was used by Wiley Post and Will Rogers for a round-the-world flight attempt, but both men died when the aircraft crashed in Alaska on 15 August 1935.

==Variants==
;Orion 9: 14 built, Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp A or Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp C
;Orion 9A Special: one aircraft with Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp SC engine
;Orion 9B: two aircraft supplied to Swissair, Wright R-1820-E engine
;Orion 9C: redesignated Altair DL-2A
;Orion 9D: 13 built
;Orion 9E: three aircraft with Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp SC-1 engine
;Orion 9F: one executive aircraft with a Wright R-1820-F2 engine
;Orion 9F-1: one executive aircraft with a Wright R-1820-F2 engine
;UC-85: one Orion 9D to USAAF in June 1942
;Orion-Explorer: modified Orion 9E, Pratt &amp; Whitney Wasp S3H1 engine

==Surviving aircraft==

In all, Lockheed built a total of 35 Orions costing each new (equivalent to in ). It is not known if any survived past the 1940s except the one that survives to the present day. This lone remaining Orion was originally built as an experimental Altair with a metal fuselage. This Altair (built in 1931) was damaged in a belly landing accident in Columbus, Ohio, in 1933. It was returned to Lockheed where it was converted in 1934 to an Orion 9C configuration by the original designer of the Orion, Richard A. von Hake, and others who worked for free during a slow period when the Lockheed factory was going into bankruptcy.

It was sold to Shell Aviation Corp., painted yellow-orange and red and named &quot;Shellightning.&quot; It was used by Shell&#x27;s aviation manager, James H. Doolittle, on cross-county and exhibition flights. Jimmy Doolittle made hundreds of trips in this Lockheed, and the aircraft was very much in evidence at air shows, airport dedications, and business meetings across the territories of all three Shell companies in the United States.

In 1936, &quot;Shellightning&quot; was again involved in an accident, in St. Louis, and was stored there. Two years later, Paul Mantz caught the racing bug in addition to his aeronautical movie work. He bought the damaged &quot;Shellightning&quot; and had it rebuilt at Parks Air College in St. Louis, Missouri with a more powerful Wright Cyclone engine and some streamlining to add to its speed. It was repainted red with white trim and Mantz flew the plane in the Bendix Races in 1938 and 1939, coming in third both times. In 1943, he sold the plane and it went through a series of owners until Mantz bought it back in 1955. He retained ownership until selling it to TallMantz Aviation, Inc. in 1962.

In 1964, the plane was sitting out in the open on the flightline at Orange County Airport, now John Wayne Airport, in blue-and-white American Airways trim. Some time in the 1960s it was purchased by Swiss Air and rebuilt to flying status by the famous &quot;Fokker&quot; restoration team and is on display at the Swiss Transport Museum in Lucerne, Switzerland in the livery of the original Swiss Air Orion.

<text>Amy Johnson (born 1 July 1903 – disappeared 5 January 1941) was a pioneering English pilot who was the first woman to fly solo from London to Australia.

Flying solo or with her husband, Jim Mollison, she set many long-distance records during the 1930s. In 1933, Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s character in the film &quot;Christopher Strong&quot; was inspired by Johnson. She flew in the Second World War as a part of the Air Transport Auxiliary. Her aircraft crashed into the Thames Estuary: she died after bailing out. Because her body was never recovered, the precise cause of her death—drowning, hypothermia or being pulled into a warship&#x27;s moving propellers, is unknown and has been a subject of discussion since the possibility of friendly fire was raised in 1999 (see below).

== Early life ==
Born in 1903 in Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, Amy Johnson was the daughter of Amy Hodge, granddaughter of William Hodge, a Mayor of Hull, and John William Johnson whose family were fish merchants in the firm of Andrew Johnson, Knudtzon and Company. She was the eldest of three sisters, the next in age being Irene who was a year younger.

Johnson was educated at Boulevard Municipal Secondary School, later Kingston High School, and the University of Sheffield, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. She then worked in London as secretary to a solicitor, William Charles Crocker. She was introduced to flying as a hobby, gaining an aviator&#x27;s certificate, No. 8662, on 28 January 1929, and a pilot&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; licence, No. 1979, on 6 July 1929, both at the London Aeroplane Club under the tutelage of Captain Valentine Baker. In 1929 she became the first British woman to obtain a ground engineer&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; licence.

Johnson was a friend and collaborator of Fred Slingsby whose Yorkshire based company, Slingsby Aviation of Kirbymoorside, North Yorkshire, became the UK&#x27;s most famous glider manufacturer. Slingsby helped found Yorkshire Gliding Club at Sutton Bank and during the 1930s she was an early member and trainee.

== Aviation ==
Johnson got the money to buy her first aircraft from her father, who was always one of her strongest supporters, and Lord Wakefield. She bought a secondhand de Havilland DH.60 Gipsy Moth G-AAAH and named it &quot;Jason&quot; after her father&#x27;s business trade mark.

In 1930, Johnson achieved worldwide recognition when she became the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia. Flying &quot;Jason&quot;, she left Croydon Airport, Surrey, on 5 May and landed at Darwin, Northern Territory on 24 May, a distance of 11,000 miles (18,000 km). Six days after, she damaged her aircraft while landing downwind at Brisbane airport and flew to Sydney with Captain Frank Follett while the aircraft was repaired. &quot;Jason&quot; was later flown to Mascot, Sydney, by Captain Lester Brain. &quot;Jason&quot; is now on permanent display in the Flight Gallery of the Science Museum in London.

She was awarded the Harmon Trophy and also the CBE in George V&#x27;s 1930 Birthday Honours in recognition of this achievement, and was honoured with the No. 1 civil pilot&#x27;s licence under Australia&#x27;s 1921 Air Navigation Regulations.

Johnson next bought a de Havilland DH.80 Puss Moth G-AAZV which she named &quot;Jason II&quot;. In July 1931, she and co-pilot Jack Humphreys became the first people to fly from London to Moscow in one day, completing the journey in approximately 21 hours. From there, they continued across Siberia and on to Tokyo, setting a record time for Britain to Japan.

In 1932, Johnson married Scottish pilot Jim Mollison, who had proposed to her during a flight together eight hours after they had first met. In July 1932, Johnson set a solo record for a flight from London to Cape Town, South Africa in the Puss Moth G-ACAB &quot;Desert Cloud&quot;, breaking her new husband&#x27;s record. De Havilland Co and Castrol Oil featured this flight in advertising campaigns.

In July 1933, Johnson and Mollison attempted to fly the de Havilland DH.84 Dragon I &quot;G-ACCV&quot;, named &quot;Seafarer&quot;, nonstop from Pendine Sands, South Wales, heading to Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York. They hoped to then fly &quot;Seafarer&quot; to Baghdad in an attempt to gain the record for a non-stop long-distance flight.

Running low on fuel and flying in the dark, the pair made the decision to land short of New York. Spotting the lights of Bridgeport Municipal Airport (now Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Stratford, Connecticut) they circled it five times before crash landing some distance outside the field in a drainage ditch. Both were thrown from the aircraft but suffered only cuts and gashes. After recuperating, the pair were feted by New York society and received a ticker tape parade down Wall Street.

In 1934, the Mollisons set a record time for a flight from Britain to India in a de Havilland DH.88 Comet named &quot;Black Magic,&quot; as part of the England to Australia MacRobertson Air Race. They were forced to retire from the race at Allahabad because of engine trouble

In September 1934, Johnson, under her married name of Mollison, became the youngest president of the Women&#x27;s Engineering Society, having been vice-president since 1934. Johnson succeeded Elizabeth M. Kennedy in the role. Johnson was succeeded as President by Edith Mary Douglas. She was active in the society until her death.

On 4 May 1936, Johnson made her last record-breaking flight, starting from Gravesend Airport and regaining her Britain to South Africa record in &quot;G-ADZO&quot;, a Percival Gull Six. In 1936, she was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club.

She further honed her gliding skills with the Midland Gliding Club, based in Shropshire, which she joined in October 1937, and remained an active flying member until gliding was suspended following the outbreak of the Second World War. In 1938, Johnson overturned her glider, when landing after a display at Walsall Aerodrome in England, but was not seriously hurt. Following the accident, she told reporters, &quot;I still declare that gliding is the safest form of flying.&quot; 

She divorced Mollison in 1937 and reverted to her maiden name. Johnson began to explore other ways to make a living through business ventures, journalism and fashion. She modelled clothes for the designer Elsa Schiaparelli and created her a travelling bag sold under her own name.

In 1939, Johnson found work flying with the Portsmouth, Southsea and Isle of Wight Aviation Company, piloting short flights across the Solent and flying as a target for searchlight batteries and anti-aircraft gunners to practise on.

== Second World War ==
During the Second World War, Johnson&#x27;s employing company&#x27;s aircraft were taken over by the Air Ministry in March 1940. She was served a notice of redundancy alongside all other pilots in the company, as all the aircraft were requisitioned for the war effort. She received a week&#x27;s pay and a further four weeks&#x27; pay of £40 as a redundancy package.

Two months later, Johnson joined the newly formed Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), which transported Royal Air Force aircraft around the country. She rose to first officer under the command of her friend and fellow pilot Pauline Gower. Her former husband also flew for the ATA throughout the war. Johnson described a typical day in her life in the ATA in a humorous article, published posthumously in 1941, for &quot;The Woman Engineer&quot; journal.

== Death ==
In a last letter to her friend, Caroline Haslett, on New Year&#x27;s Day 1941, Johnson wrote: &quot;I hope the gods will watch over you this year, and I wish you the best of luck (the only useful thing not yet taxed!)&quot;. On 5 January 1941, while flying an Airspeed Oxford for the ATA from Prestwick via RAF Squires Gate to RAF Kidlington near Oxford, it is suggested that Johnson ran out of fuel in adverse weather conditions. 

Five hours after her departure, a convoy of wartime vessels in the Thames Estuary spotted a parachute coming down and saw a person alive in the water calling for help, witnesses describing the voice as female. Conditions were poor: there was a heavy sea and a strong tide, snow was falling and it was intensely cold. Lt Cmdr Walter Fletcher, the Captain of HMS &quot;Haslemere&quot;, navigated his ship to attempt a rescue. The crew of the vessel threw ropes out to the person but they were unable to reach them and they were lost under the ship. A number of witnesses believed there was a second body in the water. 

Fletcher dived in and swam out to this, rested on it for a few minutes and then let go. When the lifeboat reached him he was unconscious and as a result of the intense cold he died in hospital days later. Johnson&#x27;s watertight flying bag, her log book and cheque book later washed up, and were recovered near the crash site.

A memorial service was held for Johnson in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields on 14 January 1941. Lt Cmdr Walter Fletcher was posthumously awarded the Albert Medal in May 1941.

=== Disputed circumstances ===
In 1999, it was reported that Johnson&#x27;s death may have been caused by friendly fire. Tom Mitchell, from Crowborough, Sussex, claimed to have shot Johnson&#x27;s aircraft down when she twice failed to give the correct identification code during the flight. Mitchell explained how the aircraft was sighted and contacted by radio. A request was made for the signal. She gave the wrong one twice. &quot;Sixteen rounds of shells were fired and the plane dived into the Thames Estuary. We all thought it was an enemy plane until the next day when we read the papers and discovered it was Amy. The officers told us never to tell anyone what happened.&quot;

In 2016, Alec Gill, a historian, claimed that the son of a ship&#x27;s crew member stated that Johnson had died because she was sucked into the blades of the ship&#x27;s propellers. The crewman did not observe this to occur, but believes it is true.

As a member of the ATA with no known grave and her body never recovered, Johnson is commemorated, under the name of Amy V. Johnson, by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission on the Air Forces Memorial at Runnymede.
== Honours and tributes ==

In June 1930, Johnson&#x27;s flight to Australia was the subject of a contemporary popular song, &quot;Amy, Wonderful Amy&quot;, composed by Horatio Nicholls and recorded by Harry Bidgood, Jack Hylton, Arthur Lally, Arthur Rosebery and Debroy Somers. She was also the guest of honour at the opening of the first Butlins holiday camp, in Skegness in 1936. From 1935 to 1937, Johnson was President of the Women&#x27;s Engineering Society.

A collection of Amy Johnson souvenirs and mementos was donated by her father to Sewerby Hall in 1958. The hall now houses a room dedicated to Amy Johnson in its museum. 

In 1974, Harry Ibbetson&#x27;s statue of Amy Johnson was unveiled in Prospect Street, Hull where a girls&#x27; school was named after her (the school closed in 2004).

In 2016, new statues of Johnson were unveiled to commemorate the 75th anniversary of her death. The first, on 17 September, was at Herne Bay, close to the site where she was last seen alive, and the second, on 30 September, was unveiled by Maureen Lipman near Hawthorne Avenue, Hull, close to Johnson&#x27;s childhood home. In 2017, &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed this second statue as one of the &quot;best female statues in Britain&quot;.

A blue plaque commemorates Johnson at Vernon Court, Hendon Way, in Childs Hill, London NW2. She is commemorated with a green plaque on The Avenues, Kingston upon Hull. She is commemorated with another blue plaque in Princes Risborough where she lived for a year.
Buildings named in Johnson&#x27;s honour include:
*&quot;Amy Johnson Building&quot; housing the department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering at the University of Sheffield.
*&quot;Amy Johnson Primary School&quot; situated on Mollison Drive on the Roundshaw Estate, Wallington, Surrey, which is built on the former runway site of Croydon Airport.
*&quot;The Hawthornes @ Amy Johnson&quot; in Hull, a major housing development by Keepmoat Homes on the site of the former Amy Johnson School.
*&quot;Amy Johnson Comet Restoration Centre&quot; at Derby Airfield, where the Mollisons&#x27; DH.88 Comet &quot;Black Magic&quot; is being restored to flying condition.
* &quot;Amy Johnson House&quot; in Cherry Orchard Road, Croydon was named for her; built in the 20th century, it was demolished in the mid-2010s.
* &quot;Amy&#x27;s Restaurant and Bar&quot; at the Hilton hotels at both London Gatwick and Stansted airports are named after her.

&quot;Amy Johnson Avenue&quot; is a main road running northwards from Tiger Brennan Drive, Winnellie, to McMillans Rd, Karama, in Darwin, Australia.

&quot;Amy Johnson Way&quot; is a road linking commercial premises in Blackpool, Lancashire, UK, adjacent to Blackpool Airport. It is also the name of a road in Clifton Moor, York.

&quot;Johnson Road&quot; is one of the roads built on the site of the former Heston Aerodrome in west London.

In 2011 the Royal Aeronautical Society established the annual Amy Johnson Named Lecture to celebrate a century of women in flight and to honour Britain&#x27;s most famous female aviator. Carolyn McCall, Chief Executive of EasyJet, delivered the Inaugural Lecture on 6 July 2011 at the Society&#x27;s headquarters in London. The Lecture is held on or close to 6 July every year to mark the date in 1929 when Amy Johnson was awarded her pilot&#x27;s licence.

Over a six-month period, inmates of Hull Prison built a full-size model of the Gipsy Moth aircraft used by Johnson to fly solo from Britain to Australia. In February 2017 this went on public display at Hull Paragon Interchange.

In 2017, Google commemorated Johnson&#x27;s 114th birthday with a Google Doodle.

In 2017, the airline Norwegian painted the tail fin of two of its aircraft with a portrait of Johnson. She is one of the company&#x27;s &quot;British tail fin heroes&quot;, joining Queen singer Freddie Mercury, children&#x27;s author Roald Dahl, England&#x27;s World Cup winning captain Bobby Moore and aviation entrepreneur Sir Freddie Laker.

A mural reading QUEEN OF THE AIR (which was a nickname the British press gave Johnson) was painted in Cricklewood railway station to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of women obtaining the right to vote in the UK.

St Mary&#x27;s Church in Beverley, East Yorkshire announced their intention of installing a stone carving of Amy Johnson as part of a programme of celebrating women in the restoration of the stonework of the medieval church in 2021. The other eight figures will include fellow engineer and WES member Hilda Lyon, Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Seacole, Marie Curie, Rosalind Franklin, Helen Sharman and Ada Lovelace.

== In popular culture ==
Johnson&#x27;s life has been the subject of a number of treatments in film and television, some more accurately biographical than others. In 1942, a film of Johnson&#x27;s life, &quot;They Flew Alone&quot;, (released in the US as &quot;Wings and the Woman&quot;) was made by director-producer Herbert Wilcox, starring Anna Neagle as Johnson and Robert Newton as Mollison. 

&quot;Amy!&quot; (1980) was an avant-garde documentary written and directed by feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey and semiologist Peter Wollen. A 1984 BBC television film &quot;Amy&quot; starred Harriet Walter in the title role. In the 1991, Australian television miniseries &quot;The Great Air Race&quot;, aka &quot;Half a World Away&quot;, based on the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race, Johnson was portrayed by Caroline Goodall.

Johnson earned a passing mention in other works such as the 2007 British film adaption of Noel Streatfeild&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;Ballet Shoes&quot;, in which the character Petrova is inspired by Johnson in her dreams of becoming an aviator.

In radio, the 2002 BBC Radio broadcast &quot;The Typist who Flew to Australia&quot;, a play by Helen Cross, presented the theme that Johnson&#x27;s aviation career was prompted by years of boredom in an unsatisfying job as a typist and sexual adventures including a seven-year affair with a Swiss businessman who married someone else.

In music, Johnson inspired a number of works, including the song &quot;Flying Sorcery&quot; from Scottish singer-songwriter Al Stewart&#x27;s album, &quot;Year of the Cat&quot; (1976). &quot;A Lone Girl Flier&quot; and &quot;Just Plain Johnnie&quot; (Jack O&#x27;Hagan) sung by Bob Molyneux, and &quot;Johnnie, Our Aeroplane Girl&quot; sung by Jack Lumsdaine. &quot;Queen of the Air&quot; (2008) by Peter Aveyard is a musical tribute to Johnson. Indie pop band The Lucksmiths used a clip of her Australia welcome speech as an intro to their song &quot;The Golden Age of Aviation&quot;.

More fictionalised portrayals include a &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic story in 2013 titled &quot;A Wing and a Prayer&quot;, in which the time-travelling Doctor encounters Johnson in 1930. He tells Clara Oswald her death is a fixed point in time. Clara realises what&#x27;s important is that it appears Amy died. They save her from drowning and then take her to the planet Cornucopia.

The character Worrals in the series of books by Captain W. E. Johns was modelled on Amy Johnson.

In 2023, screenwriter Sally Wainwright, best known for &quot;Happy Valley&quot;, revealed that she was interested in writing a drama about Johnson but &quot;failed to convince&quot; TV channels.

<doc id="184414" wikidata="Q208488" url="?curid=184414" title="Spoonbill">
<text>Spoonbills are a genus, Platalea, of large, long-legged wading birds. The spoonbills have a global distribution, being found on every continent except Antarctica. The genus name &quot;Platalea&quot; derives from Ancient Greek and means &quot;broad&quot;, referring to the distinctive shape of the bill. Six species are recognised, which although usually placed in a single genus have sometimes been split into three genera.

All spoonbills have large, flat, spatulate bills and feed by wading through shallow water, sweeping the partly opened bill from side to side. The moment any small aquatic creature touches the inside of the bill—an insect, crustacean, or tiny fish—it is snapped shut. Spoonbills generally prefer fresh water to salt but are found in both environments. They need to feed many hours each day.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Platalea&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The genus name is Latin for &quot;spoonbill&quot; and is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;platea&quot; meaning &quot;broad&quot;, referring to the distinctive shape of the bill. The type species was designated as the Eurasian spoonbill (&quot;Platalea leucorodia&quot;) by George Robert Gray in 1840.

They have traditionally been thought to form one of two subfamilies, Plataleinae, in the family Threskiornithidae, which also includes the ibises (Threskiornithinae). Molecular studies, including a 2013 study, have suggested instead that they form a clade within the family with several cosmopolitan ibis genera, separate from another clade of New World ibises.

A 2010 study of mitochondrial DNA of the spoonbills by Chesser and colleagues found that the roseate and yellow-billed spoonbills were each other&#x27;s closest relative, and the two were descended from an early offshoot from the ancestors of the other four spoonbill species. They felt the genetic evidence meant it was equally valid to consider all six to be classified within the genus &quot;Platalea&quot; or alternatively for two of the species to be placed in monotypic genera named as &quot;Platibis&quot; and &quot;Ajaja&quot;. However, as the six species were so similar morphologically, keeping them within the one genus made more sense.

==Description==
Spoonbills are most easily distinguished from ibises in the shape of their bill, which is long and flat and wider at the end. The nostrils are located near the base of the bill so that the bird can breathe while the bill is submerged in water. The eyes are positioned to provide spoonbills with binocular vision, although, when foraging, tactile senses are important too. Like ibises, spoonbills have bare patches of skin around the bill and eyes.

==Breeding==

Spoonbills are monogamous, but, so far as is known, only for one season at a time. Most species nest in trees or reed beds, often with ibises or herons. The male gathers nesting material—mostly sticks and reeds, sometimes taken from an old nest—the female weaves it into a large, shallow bowl or platform which varies in its shape and structural integrity according to species.

The female lays a clutch of about three smooth, oval, white eggs and both parents incubate; chicks hatch one at a time rather than all together. The newly hatched young are blind and cannot care for themselves immediately; both parents feed them by partial regurgitation. Chicks&#x27; bills are short and straight, and only gain the characteristic spoonbill shape as they mature. Their feeding continues for a few weeks longer after the family leaves the nest. The primary cause of brood failure appears not to be predation but starvation.

==Species and distribution==
The six species of spoonbill are distributed over much of the world.

In his comic book appearances, Deadpool is initially depicted as a supervillain of the New Mutants and X-Force, though later stories would portray him as an antihero. Deadpool is the alter ego of Wade Wilson, a disfigured Canadian mercenary with superhuman regenerative healing abilities. 

Originally created as a parody of the DC Comics villain Deathstroke (Slade Wilson), the character was an instant success with readers, becoming a breakout character in the &quot;X-Men&quot; books, quickly developing a distinctive backstory and earning his own series and a joint book alongside the character Cable with whom he is frequently paired. Part of the reason for his popularity is his tendency to joke incessantly and break the fourth wall for humorous effect.

The character&#x27;s popularity has seen him featured in numerous other media outlets. In the 2004 series &quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot;, he refers to his own scarred appearance as &quot;Ryan Renolds crossed with a Shar Pei&quot;. Reynolds developed an interest in portraying the character after reading the comic, which was ultimately realized in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series, including &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; (2009), &quot;Deadpool&quot; (2016), and its sequels &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018) and Marvel Cinematic Universe&#x27;s &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024), in the latter of which Reynolds&#x27; wife Blake Lively, Matthew McConaughey, Paul Mullin, Nathan Fillion, Peggy, and Reynolds&#x27; children Inez and Olin portray alternate universe variants of Deadpool.

==Publication history==
===1990s===
Created by artist/writer Rob Liefeld and writer Fabian Nicieza, Deadpool made his first appearance on the pages of &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #98 cover-dated Feb. 1991. According to Nicieza, Liefeld came up with the character&#x27;s visual design and name, and Nicieza himself came up with the character&#x27;s speech mannerisms.

Liefeld&#x27;s favorite comic title before &quot;X-Men&quot; was &quot;Avengers&quot;, which featured weapons like Captain America&#x27;s shield, Thor&#x27;s hammer and Hawkeye&#x27;s bow and arrow. Because of this, he also decided to give weapons to his new characters. Liefeld, a fan of the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; comics, showed his new character to then-writer Fabian Nicieza. Upon seeing the costume and noting his characteristics (killer with super agility), Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying, &quot;This is Deathstroke from Teen Titans&quot;. Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of &quot;Wade Wilson&quot; as an inside-joke to being &quot;related&quot; to &quot;Slade Wilson&quot;, Deathstroke.

Liefeld spoke on how the character was influenced by Spider-Man: &quot;The simplicity of the mask was my absolute jealousy over Spider-Man and the fact that both of my buddies, [fellow Marvel artists] Erik Larsen and Todd McFarlane, would tell me, &#x27;I love drawing Spider-Man. You just do an oval and two big eyes. You’re in, you’re out.&#x27; ... The Spider-Man I grew up with would make fun of you or punch you in the face and make small cracks. That was the entire intent with Deadpool. ... I specifically told Marvel, &#x27;He&#x27;s Spider-Man, except with guns and swords.&#x27; The idea was, he&#x27;s a jackass.&quot;
Other inspirations were Wolverine and Snake Eyes. Liefeld states: &quot;Wolverine and Spider-Man were the two properties I was competing with at all times. I didn&#x27;t have those, I didn&#x27;t have access to those. I had to make my own Spider-Man and Wolverine. That&#x27;s what Cable and Deadpool were meant to be, my own Spider-Man and my own Wolverine.&quot; &quot;&quot;G.I. Joe&quot; was my first obsession. Those were the toys in the sandbox with me, kung fu grip, eagle eye, I had them all. &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; is a world of characters that I have always aspired to participate in. Snake Eyes was a profound influence on my creating Deadpool.&quot;

Both Deadpool and Cable were also meant to be tied into Wolverine&#x27;s history already from the start, as Liefeld describes: &quot;Wolverine was my guy. If I could tie anything into Wolverine, I was winning.&quot; Like Wolverine, Deadpool is (or is thought to be) Canadian. The original story had him joining the Weapon X program after being kicked out of the U.S. Army Special Forces and given an artificial healing factor based on Wolverine&#x27;s, thanks to Dr. Emrys Killebrew, one of the head scientists.
In his first appearance, Deadpool is hired by Tolliver to attack Cable and the New Mutants. After subsequently appearing in &quot;X-Force&quot; as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles, such as &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Daredevil&quot;, and &quot;Heroes for Hire&quot;. In 1993, the character received his own miniseries, titled &quot;The Circle Chase&quot;, written by Fabian Nicieza and pencilled by Joe Madureira. It was a relative success and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by Mark Waid, pencilled by Ian Churchill, and inked by Jason Temujin Minor and Bud LaRosa. Waid later commented, &quot;Frankly, if I&#x27;d known Deadpool was such a creep when I agreed to write the mini-series, I wouldn&#x27;t have done it. Someone who hasn&#x27;t paid for their crimes presents a problem for me.&quot;

In 1997, Deadpool was given his own ongoing title, the first volume of &quot;Deadpool&quot;, written by sequentially Joe Kelly, Christopher Priest and Gail Simone. &quot;Deadpool&quot; became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother Blind Al and his best friend Weasel. The ongoing series gained cult popularity for its unorthodox main character, its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained.

===2000s===
&quot;Deadpool&quot; lasted until issue #69, at which point it was relaunched as a new title with a similar character called &quot;Agent X&quot; in 2002. This occurred during a line-wide revamp of X-Men-related comics, with &quot;Cable&quot; becoming &quot;Soldier X&quot; and &quot;X-Force&quot; becoming &quot;X-Statix&quot;. It appeared that Deadpool was killed in an explosion fighting the supervillain Black Swan. Deadpool&#x27;s manager Sandi Brandenberg later founded Agency X with a mysterious man called Alex Hayden, who took the name dubbed Agent X. Deadpool later returned to the series, which would conclude with issues 13–15.

Deadpool&#x27;s next starring appearance came in 2004, with the launch of &quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot; written by Fabian Nicieza, where Deadpool became partnered with his former enemy, Cable, teaming up in various adventures. This title was canceled with issue #50 and replaced by a new &quot;Cable&quot; series in March 2008. Deadpool then appeared briefly in the &quot;&quot; title by writer Daniel Way before Way and Paco Medina launched another &quot;Deadpool&quot; title in September 2008. Medina was the main series artist, with Carlo Barberi filling in on the first issue after the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; tie-in.

A new &quot;Deadpool&quot; ongoing series began as a &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; tie-in. In the first arc, the character is seen working with Nick Fury to steal data on how to kill the Skrull queen Veranke. Norman Osborn steals the information that Deadpool had stolen from the Skrulls, and subsequent stories deal with the fallout from that. The story also sees the return of Bob, Agent of HYDRA. This all led directly to a confrontation with the new Thunderbolts in &quot;Magnum Opus&quot; which crossed over between &quot;Deadpool&quot; vol. 2 #8–9 and &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; #130–131. In &quot;Deadpool&quot; #15, Deadpool decides to become a hero resulting in conflicts with proper heroes like Spider-Man (who he had recently encountered in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #611 as part of &quot;The Gauntlet&quot;) and leading to a 3-issue arc where he takes on Hit-Monkey, a character who debuted in the same month in a digital, then-print, one-shot.

Another ongoing Deadpool series, &quot;Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth&quot;, launched in July 2009, written by Victor Gischler, with art by Bong Dazo. In it Deadpool teams with Headpool from &quot;Marvel Zombies 3&quot; and &quot;4&quot;.

A special anniversary issue titled &quot;Deadpool&quot; #900 was released in October 2009. A third Deadpool ongoing series, &quot;Deadpool Team-Up&quot;, launched in November 2009 (with issue numbers counting in reverse starting with issue #899), written by Fred Van Lente, with art by Dalibor Talajic. This series features Deadpool teaming up with different heroes from the Marvel Universe in each issue, such as Hercules. Deadpool also joined the cast of the new &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; team.

===2010s===
Another Deadpool series by Gischler titled &quot;Deadpool Corps&quot; was released in April 2010. Besides Deadpool himself, this series featured alternate versions of Deadpool, including a female version of himself named Wanda Wilson / Lady Deadpool (who debuted in &quot;Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth&quot; #7), Headpool (the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; universe incarnation, now reduced to a severed head), and two new characters; Kidpool, a child, and Dogpool, a dog. The series lasted twelve issues.

Marvel also published &quot;Deadpool&quot; titles through the Marvel Knights and MAX imprints: &quot;Deadpool: Wade Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;, by Duane Swierczynski and Jason Pearson, and &quot;Deadpool MAX&quot; by David Lapham and Kyle Baker.

Deadpool vol. 2 was written by Daniel Way and drawn by Alé Garza. In the story arc &quot;DEAD&quot;, Wade is &quot;cured&quot; of his healing ability and becomes mortal. As a side effect, he also has his old, unscarred face once again. Although he spent the majority of the story arc looking forward to dying, he suppresses his desires in order to protect his friend and sidekick Hydra Bob.

After he loses his healing factor, Wilson claims he felt &quot;more alive than ever.&quot; However, after a harsh beating from Intelligencia, Wade realized that he had let his ability to heal compensate for skill so he decided to ask for help from Taskmaster in training. Taskmaster asked Wilson to help him steal Pym Particles from S.H.I.E.L.D., but actually, he allowed Black Box to study Wade in order to prepare his vengeance against Wilson, even letting him know Deadpool lost his healing factor.

Wade managed to defeat Black Box, Black Tom and Black Swan, but in the process, his face was burned and disfigured again. Former FBI agent Allison Kemp wanted to get revenge on Deadpool because of his involvement in an accident which left her in a wheelchair, and she called other enemies of Deadpool such as T-Ray and Slayback and trained them to kill Deadpool. Deadpool infiltrated their base and managed to get T-Ray and Slayback killed when Kemp was about to kill herself in an explosion which would kill Wade in the process, he convinced her not to attack him. At that moment, he was surprised by the returned Evil Deadpool, who informed Wade that the serum they took was not permanent, which was why Wade&#x27;s face did not heal or a finger he lost grew back, so Wade would return after Evil Deadpool shot him. Daniel Way&#x27;s Deadpool series concluded with issue 63.

As part of Marvel&#x27;s Marvel NOW! initiative, a new &quot;Deadpool&quot; ongoing series was launched. He is also a member of the Thunderbolts. In the 27th issue of his new series, as part of &quot;All-New Marvel NOW!&quot;, Deadpool was married for the third time. Initially a secret, his bride was revealed in the webcomic &quot;Deadpool: The Gauntlet&quot; to be Shiklah, Queen of the Undead. Deadpool also discovers that he has a daughter, Eleanor, from a former flame named Carmelita.

During the events of &quot;Original Sin&quot;, it was revealed that Deadpool was tricked into killing his parents by a scientist known as Butler (who abducted Eleanor and gave her to his brother); however, Deadpool does not know about it.

Much later, he clashed with Carnage, believing the universe was telling the latter to defeat him. After several fights and getting torn to pieces, Deadpool bonds with four symbiotes: Riot, Phage, Lasher and Agony. Playing mind games, Deadpool tricked Shriek by using his shapeshifting abilities to make her disoriented and having her flee. After the symbiotic Deadpool and Carnage fought again, Deadpool captures Shriek and forces her to impersonate himself, making it trick Carnage into almost killing her in the process. Feeling broken after a mental breakdown, Carnage allowed himself to be arrested and was placed in an unlocked cell. While sitting in the cell until he was his own self, Carnage swore vengeance on Deadpool. Deadpool, after defeating Carnage, gives the four symbiotes to a war dog who helped Deadpool fight Carnage to deliver them to the government.

During the &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, Deadpool appears as a member of Magneto&#x27;s unnamed supervillain group during the fight against Red Skull&#x27;s Red Onslaught form. The group of villains becomes inverted to heroes, after a spell cast by Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom. This group was later named the Astonishing Avengers. This Deadpool, referred to as &quot;Zenpool&quot;, was pivotal in turning Apocalypse to fighting the Inverted Avengers.

Deadpool&#x27;s death occurs in &quot;Deadpool&quot; #250. Deadpool faces off in a final showdown with ULTIMATUM and Flag-Smasher, killing all of them, and gives up the &quot;Deadpool&quot; identity, wishing to have a better life. He, along with his family and friends, are all killed when the Earth collides with an alternate universe&#x27;s Earth. Deadpool laments that the Secret Wars should have stayed an Avengers event, but then dies at peace, content that everybody else is dying with him.

====All New, All Different Marvel====
Eight months after the events of &quot;Secret Wars&quot; and the restoration of Earth, Deadpool is seen working for Steve Rogers. After stealing some potentially life-saving chemicals needed by an ailing Rogue, he is offered membership in the Avengers Unity Squad.

&quot;Deadpool&quot; Vol. 4 began in 2016. In the course of the following months, Deadpool&#x27;s popularity skyrocketed after the mercenary Solo impersonated him to piggyback on Deadpool&#x27;s reputation and take jobs at a higher pay rate. One of Solo&#x27;s jobs in Washington, D.C. had Deadpool&#x27;s public opinion drastically change for the better when he saved an ambassador from his telepathically manipulated agents. After learning of Solo&#x27;s impersonation, Deadpool came up with the idea to form a group of mercenaries called the Mercs for Money to extend his reach across the globe. However, Deadpool&#x27;s newfound popularity forced him to leave his family behind, fearing his enemies could endanger them. Deadpool additionally joined the Avengers Unity Division and used his popularity as a means of funding the team, with the profit from the merchandise.

Madcap additionally returned to Deadpool&#x27;s life, though Wade was unaware his experience inside his mind left Madcap emotionally damaged and vengeful. Madcap initially posed as an ally, joining the Mercs for Money, but eventually showed his true intentions after he was discovered impersonating Deadpool to defame and threaten his loved ones. Seeing as he had had enough fun, Madcap used an alien weapon to molecularly disintegrate himself. For his second coming, the villain had Deadpool unwittingly become the carrier of a deadly airborne virus with which he infected his family. Wade found a cure, though had to resort to Cable&#x27;s evil clone Stryfe to find it. Around this time, tensions between Shiklah&#x27;s domain and the surface world sparked an invasion of Manhattan from Monster Metropolis, which in turn led to Shiklah divorcing Deadpool, opting to return to Dracula instead.

Not long after Wade joined the Avengers Unity Division, the real Steve Rogers was secretly supplanted by an evil fascist counterpart from another timeline that operated as a Hydra sleeper agent within the superhero community. When Phil Coulson became suspicious of Steve, Rogers convinced Deadpool to kill him, claiming that Coulson had gone rogue. A short time afterward, Captain America&#x27;s machinations resulted in Hydra rising to power, taking over the United States of America. When Hydra&#x27;s conquest had barely begun, Preston found out about Coulson&#x27;s death and confronted Deadpool about it. The fight ended in Preston&#x27;s death. As Hydra&#x27;s empire grew stronger, Wade joined its own version of the Avengers out of blind loyalty for Captain America. Plagued by guilt, Wade held back when tasked with hunting down the rebel alliance known as the Underground and eventually helped, behind the scenes, to lay part of the foundation of Hydra&#x27;s eventual defeat. With his mistakes costing the lives of two of his friends, the love of his daughter, and any respect the world had for him, Deadpool turned his back on what little remained of the life he had built.

In &quot;Deadpool&quot; (vol. 9), Deadpool adopts Princess, a symbiote and clone of Carnage who takes a hyena-like form.

==Characterization==
===Personality===
Deadpool is aware that he is a fictional comic book character. He commonly breaks the fourth wall, which is done by few other characters in the Marvel Universe, and this is used to humorous effect, for instance, by having Deadpool converse with his own &quot;inner monologue&quot;, represented by caption boxes. In stories by writer Daniel Way between 2008 and 2012, Deadpool was, without explanation, shown to have developed a second &quot;voice in his head&quot;, represented by a second set of captions with a different font; &quot;Deadpool&quot; vol. 3 Annual #1 (2014) would retroactively explain that this voice belonged to Madcap, a psychotic Captain America villain, who had become molecularly entangled with Deadpool.

The character&#x27;s back-story has been presented as vague and subject to change, and within the narrative, he is unable to remember his personal history due to a mental condition. Whether or not his name was even Wade Wilson is subject to speculation since one of his nemeses, T-Ray, claims in &quot;Deadpool&quot; #33 that he is the real Wade Wilson and that Deadpool is a vicious murderer who stole his identity. There have been other dubious stories about his history—at one point the supervillain Loki claimed to be his father. Frequently, revelations are later retconned or ignored altogether, and in one issue, Deadpool himself joked that whether or not he is actually Wade Wilson depends on which writer the reader prefers.

Deadpool is depicted as having a regenerative healing factor, which not only prevents him from being permanently injured through enhanced cell regeneration throughout his body, but also causes psychosis and mental instability, as his neurons are also affected by the accelerated regeneration. It is thought that while his psychosis is a handicap, it is also one of his assets as it makes him an extremely unpredictable opponent. Taskmaster, who has photo-reflexive memory which allows him to copy anyone&#x27;s fighting skills by observation, was unable to defeat Deadpool due to his chaotic and improvised fighting style. Taskmaster has also stated that Deadpool is an expert at distracting his opponents.

Deadpool has sometimes been portrayed to have a strong sense of core morality. In &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot;, he storms out after Wolverine tries to rationalize Fantomex killing Apocalypse, who was at the time in a child form. After Wolverine argues that Deadpool is motivated solely by money, Archangel reveals that Deadpool never cashed any of his checks.

===Sexual orientation===
In December 2013, Deadpool was confirmed as being pansexual by &quot;Deadpool&quot; writer Gerry Duggan via Twitter. However, this post on Twitter has since been deleted by Gerry Duggan. When asked about Deadpool&#x27;s sexuality, co-creator Fabian Nicieza stated, &quot;Deadpool is whatever sexual inclination his brain tells him he is in THAT moment. And then the moment passes.&quot; Nicieza has also stated,

Not trying to be dismissive, but readers always want to &#x27;make a character their own&#x27;, and often that is to the exclusion of what the character might mean to other fans. I&#x27;ve been dogged with the DP sexuality questions for YEARS. It is a bit tiring. He is NO sex and ALL sexes. He is yours and everyone else&#x27;s. So not dismissive, but rather the epitome of inclusive.

===Powers and abilities===
Deadpool&#x27;s primary power is an accelerated healing factor, depicted by various writers at differing levels of efficiency. The speed of his healing factor depends on the severity of the wound and Deadpool&#x27;s mental state. It works most efficiently when he is awake, alert, and in good spirits. Deadpool&#x27;s accelerated healing factor is strong enough that he has survived complete incineration and decapitation more than once. Although his head normally has to be reunited with his body to heal a decapitation wound, he was able to regrow his head after having it pulverized by the Hulk in the graphic novel &quot;Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe&quot;.

Deadpool&#x27;s brain cells are similarly affected, with dying neurons being rejuvenated at a super accelerated rate. This allows Deadpool to recover from any head wounds, and it renders him nearly invulnerable to psychic and telepathic powers, although this ability is inconsistent. It has been revealed that at the time his healing ability was given to him, Deadpool suffered from some form of cancer; after the healing factor was given to him, it made his normal cells as well as his cancerous cells unable to die, giving him a heavily scarred appearance beneath his suit.

Deadpool&#x27;s body is highly resistant to most drugs and toxins, due to his accelerated healing factor. For example, it is extremely difficult for him to become intoxicated. He can be affected by certain drugs, such as tranquilizers if he is exposed to a large enough dosage. Unlike Wolverine, Deadpool has some degree of pain insensitivity, often referring to his gore and impalement injuries as being &quot;ticklish&quot;.

Deadpool is effectively immortal, although he has died several times. He is still alive 800 years in the future when the new X-Force encounters him. In addition, Thanos once declared that Deadpool should &quot;consider yourself cursed... with life!&quot; out of jealousy over Deadpool&#x27;s status as Death&#x27;s love interest. His enemy T-Ray later resurrected him, under Thanos&#x27; instruction, using an artifact he had given him. Later, Deadpool was informed that Thanos had placed a curse on him, and tracked Thanos down. He revealed that the only thing keeping Wade alive was his &quot;spell of darkest necromancy&quot;. Although Thanos removed this curse in order to kill Deadpool, he felt forced to immediately bring him back using &quot;a fusion of necromancy and science&quot; in order to request his aid in tracking down Mistress Death, who had gone missing.

Deadpool is a highly trained assassin and mercenary. He is adept in multiple forms of martial arts, including Savate. Deadpool is an extraordinary athlete, and an expert swordsman and marksman. He is skilled in the use of multiple weapons, including katanas, knives, grenades, and guns. His accelerated healing factor may contribute to his abilities, allowing him to perform the intense exercise for extended periods of time with minimal aches and fatigue. Although in earlier years he was originally portrayed as having superhuman strength, he is no longer depicted as having this ability.

Over the years, Deadpool has owned a number of personal teleportation devices. Also, during Deadpool&#x27;s first ongoing comic, he possesses a device that projected holographic disguises, allowing him to go undercover or conceal his appearance. Deadpool is multilingual, with the ability to speak fluently in German, Spanish, ASL, and Japanese, in addition to his native English.

Since Deadpool is aware that he is a fictional character, he uses this knowledge to his advantage to deal with opponents or gain knowledge to which he should not normally have access, such as reading past issues of his and others&#x27; comics.

Despite his otherwise exemplary physical skills, Deadpool cannot dunk in basketball at all.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; timeline, Deadpool was redubbed Dead Man Wade and reimagined as a bitter, humorless member of Apocalypse&#x27;s Pale Riders, having received his flawed healing factor from Apocalypse&#x27;s eugenics program. Sent with his team to invade the Savage Land, he attempted to unleash chaos upon the sanctuary but was killed by Nightcrawler, who teleported his head off his body and hid it in a crater. Later, Dead Man Wade was revealed to be resurrected like many of the other Alpha mutants.

===Apocalypse Wars===
In the &quot;Extraordinary X-Men&quot; Apocalypse Wars crossover, Deadpool is a Horseman of Apocalypse.

===&quot;Captain America: Who Won&#x27;t Wield the Shield&quot;===
The World War II-era version of Deadpool is introduced in the one-shot parody issue &quot;Captain America: Who Won&#x27;t Wield the Shield&quot;. Frederick &quot;Wheezy&quot; Wilson, the nephew of President Woodrow Wilson, is a soldier who is experimented on by the Nazis to become &#x27;Veapon X&#x27;. Despite the nature of the story as a period piece, Wilson peppers his speech with anachronistic slang from the 1990s.

===Deadpool Corps===
===&quot;Deadpool Killology&quot;===
====&quot;Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe&quot;====
In the storyline &quot;Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe&quot;, the X-Men send Deadpool to a mental hospital for therapy. The doctor treating him is actually Psycho-Man in disguise, who attempts to torture and brainwash Deadpool into becoming his personal minion. The procedure fails but leaves Deadpool even more mentally unhinged, erasing the &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;Screwball&quot; voices in his head and replacing them with a voice that only wants destruction. Under &quot;Evil Voice&#x27;s&quot; influence, Deadpool develops a more nihilistic world view and as a result, after killing Psycho-Man by repeatedly smashing him against a desk, (and after he burns the hospital by using gasoline) he begins assassinating every superhero and supervillain on Earth, starting with the Fantastic Four and even killing the Watcher, in an apparent attempt to rebel against his comic book creators. The book ends with him breaking into the &quot;real&quot; world and confronting the Marvel writers and artists who are writing the book. He says to the reader that once he is done with this universe, &quot;I&#x27;ll find you soon enough.&quot;

====&quot;Deadpool Killustrated&quot;====
After the events of &quot;Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe&quot;, Deadpool has killed many versions of Marvel superheroes and villains across the multiverse to no effect and comes to a conclusion that infinite alternate versions of the heroes and villains he killed exist. In the series, Deadpool hires a team of scientists to help him get rid of all Marvel characters. The Mad Thinker gives the Merc with a Mouth a device that transports him to the &quot;Ideaverse&quot;, a universe that contains the classic characters that inspired Marvel characters. In each book, he hunts down and murders characters such as the Headless Horseman (who inspired the Green Goblin and Ghost Rider), the characters of &quot;Little Women&quot; (Black Widow, She-Hulk, Elektra), Captain Ahab (General Thunderbolt Ross), the Little Mermaid (Namor), Mowgli (Ka-Zar), Count Dracula (Marvel&#x27;s Dracula, Morbius, Blade) and more. He also installs his own brain into Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, giving his dark inner voice a body to help him with. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson enlist Beowulf, Hua Mulan and Natty Bumppo to stop him.

====&quot;Deadpool Kills Deadpool&quot;====
On April 4, 2013, Cullen Bunn revealed that, following the publication of &quot;Deadpool Killustrated&quot;, the next and last part of the &quot;Deadpool Killology&quot; is &quot;Deadpool Kills Deadpool&quot;, stating that the murderous, nihilistic Deadpool that appeared in &quot;Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe&quot; and &quot;Killustrated&quot; is now called &quot;Dreadpool&quot; and, in the series, he hunts down all versions of Deadpool, while &quot;our&quot; Deadpool, the light-hearted Merc With A Mouth, hunted down Dreadpool. Bunn stated that the Deadpool Corps appeared along with many other versions of Deadpool and new versions. The first book was released in July 2013. The first issue opens with Deadpool dealing with yet another attack by ULTIMATUM, after which the Deadpool Corps quickly ropes the titular character into the crisis. Over the course of the storyline, the Deadpool Corps is killed (not including Headpool, who was already killed prior to the events of the storyline), and it concludes in Issue #4, where Deadpool clashes with Dreadpool, who is eventually shown the error of his ways and killed by Deadpool in vengeance for causing the death of his friends. Somehow, the mainstream Deadpool finds his way back, but not before the reader is aware that Dreadpool is still alive and scheming.

====&quot;Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe Again&quot;====
In the storyline &quot;Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe Again&quot;, in another universe diverging from the events of &quot;&quot;, the villains of the world elect to use a brainwashed Deadpool instead of Wolverine to wipe out the X-Men, and in-turn all the other heroes of the world. Once Mr. Knight&#x27;s assistant Gwen Poole realises what is going on, just after Deadpool has killed every hero in the alternative continuity but for her, she makes a sacrifice play and uses his trigger word to set him against the villains instead.

===&quot;Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth&quot;===

Several alternate incarnations of Deadpool are introduced in the series &quot;Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth&quot;. Attempting to return Headpool to the Marvel Zombies universe, Deadpool encounters multiple versions of himself as they exist in other universes, including a female version of himself named Lady Deadpool, Major Wade Wilson, a militant but sane version of Deadpool, and The Deadpool Kid (KidPool), a cowboy version of Deadpool who exists within a universe resembling the Wild West.

===Deadpool Pulp===

&quot;Deadpool Pulp&quot; is a four-issue limited series from writers Mike Benson and Adam Glass and artist Laurence Campbell, with Deadpool set in the 1950s drawing on pulp fiction (similar to the Marvel Noir fictional universe).

This version retains his twin katanas and wears a ninja style mask.

===Deadpool: Samurai===

===Hulked-Out Heroes===

Appearing first in &quot;Hulk&quot; vol. 2 #21, Deadpool is &quot;hulked-out&quot; near the end of the Fall of the Hulks storyline.

===Identity Wars===
When Deadpool, Spider-Man, and Hulk went to another universe, Deadpool found Death Wish who looked like Deadpool but the red part of his costume was green. Deadpool and Death Wish started hanging out with each other and having a lot of fun until Wade Wilson of this universe named Death Mask came in and killed Death Wish who was revealed to be the Victor von Doom of this universe gone crazy. Then Deadpool vowed revenge against Death Mask for killing Death Wish and killed all of the members of Death Mask&#x27;s group. After that Deadpool defeated Death Mask by throwing a bomb at him, which knocked him out. Deadpool started impersonating Death Mask until he and the other Heroes went back to their universe.

===Marvel 2099===

She has taken an older Wade prisoner and forces him to watch political debates while chained up, angered that he has ruined her life and hopes she can use him to find her mother. Wade reveals he and Shiklah had a falling out after the death of Ellie, which led to a battle between the two former lovers in Hell. The new Deadpool is also being pursued by a woman who wears a costume that looks like Wade&#x27;s &quot;Zenpool&quot; identity from Axis. The mysterious woman rescues Wade and gives him access to her bike to a hologram Preston. She then battles Warda and is revealed to be an alive Ellie, who plans to reclaim the Deadpool name. Wade and Preston break into the old hideout of the Uncanny Avengers for Wade to gear up. Warda and Ellie continue fighting until Warda reveals she will unleash a demonic monster unless Ellie does not get Wade to confess where Shiklah is. After Wade and Preston reunite with Ellie, Wade tells Ellie to search for Shiklah&#x27;s casket at Doc Samson&#x27;s grave while he and Preston then go to the Little Italy of 2099 to seek the help of one of the few heroes alive in this time period: Iron Fist.

The heroes and Danny&#x27;s Iron Fists confront Warda in Madison Star Garden, where the Iron Fists fend off the giant monster while Wade tries to prevent his daughters from fighting by promising to tell Warda where Shiklah is. Despite his plea, Warda murders Ellie with liquid napalm and takes Wade to the sewer to interrogate him, where Wade reveals that Ellie&#x27;s mutant ability is to regenerate all at once into her teenage body, allowing her to survive Warda&#x27;s attack. After Wade, Preston, and Ellie defeat Warda, Wade tells her that he and Shiklah had an on-and-off-again relationship, but were always on the path for war which eventually resulted in her death, as on Earth, those who refuse to co-exist cease to exist (with Wade bringing up the Skrulls to support his point). He implants Preston into Warda&#x27;s head so she can aid Warda in clearing her conscious and becoming a better person and tells his daughters that they can both be Deadpool. He later tells Ellie that he now plans to travel the world and rid the planet of his old enemies and that Shiklah&#x27;s resting place is in a shrunken glass coffin located on top of his heart.

===Marvel 2997===
In Messiah War Deadpool is locked in a freezer for eight hundred years. When he escapes he is captured by the armed forces of the few surviving humans left. He helps Cable to get Hope Summers back from Stryfe who is later revealed to be inside this version of Deadpool&#x27;s head. After seemingly defeating Stryfe, this version of Deadpool is quickly ripped in half and appears to die shortly after, his last words being a joke on &quot;severance&quot; pay.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the first &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; limited series, a zombie version of Deadpool is seen fighting the Silver Surfer. The zombie Deadpool eventually loses his body and appears as a disembodied head beginning in &quot;Marvel Zombies 3&quot;. This incarnation of Deadpool, frequently referred to as Headpool, entered the mainstream Marvel continuity when he is encountered and captured by the original Deadpool in &quot;Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth&quot;. Along with several other alternate versions of Deadpool, Headpool went on to appear in &quot;Deadpool Corps&quot; with a propeller beanie mounted to his head, granting him flight.

===Spider-Man &amp; Deadpool===
In an alternate future, Spider-Man is an old man who got paralyzed from a Life Model Decoy Deadpool and lives in a retirement home with an elderly Deadpool. Unknown to Spider-Man, Oldpool was giving his blood to Peter so he would not die due to his old age. In a battle between LMD Deadpools, Oldpool uses a time machine and mistakenly switches places with the mainstream Deadpool. After they got to the main timeline they are reunited with the main Spider-Man and Oldpool. Then after stopping Master Matrix (the LMD master created by Peter&#x27;s parents) and Chameleon, Old Man Peter and Oldpool fade away to their timeline.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; version of Deadpool is Sergeant &quot;Wadey&quot; Wilson, a Gulf War veteran. Depicted as an anti-mutant extremist, he is a cyborg and leader of the Reavers who hunt mutants for sport on a reality TV show. Beneath the mask, Deadpool appears to be a skull with an exposed brain, his skin formed by a transparent shell. He also has the ability to mimic an individual&#x27;s appearance and voice, though not their powers. Wadey reappears in &quot;Deadpool Kills Deadpool&quot; (written by Cullen Bunn and released in 2013) as a member of the Evil Deadpool Corps, led by Dreadpool, whose aim was to exterminate alternate versions of Deadpool across the multiverse, including the regular Deadpool Corps. In issue #4, he is killed by the mainstream Deadpool.

===Venomverse===
In &quot;Edge of Venomverse&quot;, Deadpool from another universe investigated a facility where illegal experiments were being performed with parasitic worms.

===Weapon X: Days of Future Now===
In the alternate Earth ending of the &quot;Weapon X&quot; comic, Deadpool is recruited by Wolverine to be part of a new team of X-Men after the old team is killed. He joins, claiming Wolverine only wants him as the &quot;token human&quot;. This version of Deadpool is killed by Agent Zero&#x27;s Anti-Healing Factor corrosive acid. This version of Deadpool speaks in white text boxes.

===What If...?===
In a &quot;What If...?&quot; one-shot titled &quot;Demon in the Armor&quot;, which happens to take place in Earth-90211, Wade Wilson, like Deadpool, is hired by Galactus to kill the Beyonder for merging MODOK to Galactus&#x27;s rear end in exchange for the Community Cube. He was given a weapon called the Recton Expungifier, the only weapon that could kill the Beyonder. When Deadpool tracked down his target to a nightclub, he was enticed into the Beyonder&#x27;s partying lifestyle, getting Jheri curls in the process. While hanging out with the Beyonder in a flying limousine, Spider-Man broke into the car and demanded the symbiote costume be removed from himself. Beyonder&#x27;s driver shoots Spider-Man out of the limousine, the symbiote leaves Spider-Man and merges with Deadpool, creating Venompool. However, after years of partying, Beyonder grew tired and threw Venompool to the world, snapping him out of Beyonder&#x27;s magic. Venompool attempted to resume his contract and kill the Beyonder, but he accidentally pawned the Recton Expungifier. He decides to get himself clean by kidnapping and selling a drunken Tony Stark to A.I.M. Unfortunately, he cannot join any major superhero teams, like the Avengers, Defenders and Fantastic Four because of his newly acquired Jheri curls.

<text>Forkhead box protein P2 (FOXP2) is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the &quot;FOXP2&quot; gene. FOXP2 is a member of the forkhead box family of transcription factors, proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to DNA. It is expressed in the brain, heart, lungs and digestive system.

&quot;FOXP2&quot; is found in many vertebrates, where it plays an important role in mimicry in birds (such as birdsong) and echolocation in bats. &quot;FOXP2&quot; is also required for the proper development of speech and language in humans. In humans, mutations in &quot;FOXP2&quot; cause the severe speech and language disorder developmental verbal dyspraxia. Studies of the gene in mice and songbirds indicate that it is necessary for vocal imitation and the related motor learning. Outside the brain, &quot;FOXP2&quot; has also been implicated in development of other tissues such as the lung and digestive system.

Initially identified in 1998 as the genetic cause of a speech disorder in a British family designated the KE family, &quot;FOXP2&quot; was the first gene discovered to be associated with speech and language and was subsequently dubbed &quot;the language gene&quot;. However, other genes are necessary for human language development, and a 2018 analysis confirmed that there was no evidence of recent positive evolutionary selection of &quot;FOXP2&quot; in humans.

== Structure and function ==
As a FOX protein, FOXP2 contains a forkhead-box domain. In addition, it contains a polyglutamine tract, a zinc finger and a leucine zipper. The protein attaches to the DNA of other proteins and controls their activity through the forkhead-box domain. Only a few targeted genes have been identified, however researchers believe that there could be up to hundreds of other genes targeted by the FOXP2 gene. The forkhead box P2 protein is active in the brain and other tissues before and after birth, and many studies show that it is paramount for the growth of nerve cells and transmission between them. The FOXP2 gene is also involved in synaptic plasticity, making it imperative for learning and memory.

&quot;FOXP2&quot; is required for proper brain and lung development. Knockout mice with only one functional copy of the &quot;FOXP2&quot; gene have significantly reduced vocalizations as pups. Knockout mice with no functional copies of &quot;FOXP2&quot; are runted, display abnormalities in brain regions such as the Purkinje layer, and die an average of 21 days after birth from inadequate lung development.

&quot;FOXP2&quot; is expressed in many areas of the brain, including the basal ganglia and inferior frontal cortex, where it is essential for brain maturation and speech and language development. In mice, the gene was found to be twice as highly expressed in male pups than female pups, which correlated with an almost double increase in the number of vocalisations the male pups made when separated from mothers. Conversely, in human children aged 4–5, the gene was found to be 30% more expressed in the Broca&#x27;s areas of female children. The researchers suggested that the gene is more active in &quot;the more communicative sex&quot;.

The expression of &quot;FOXP2&quot; is subject to post-transcriptional regulation, particularly microRNA (miRNA), causing the repression of the FOXP2 3&#x27; untranslated region.

Three amino acid substitutions distinguish the human &quot;FOXP2&quot; protein from that found in mice, while two amino acid substitutions distinguish the human &quot;FOXP2&quot; protein from that found in chimpanzees, but only one of these changes is unique to humans. Evidence from genetically manipulated mice and human neuronal cell models suggests that these changes affect the neural functions of &quot;FOXP2&quot;.

== Clinical significance ==
The FOXP2 gene has been implicated in several cognitive functions including; general brain development, language, and synaptic plasticity. The FOXP2 gene region acts as a transcription factor for the forkhead box P2 protein. Transcription factors affect other regions, and the forkhead box P2 protein has been suggested to also act as a transcription factor for hundreds of genes. This prolific involvement opens the possibility that the FOXP2 gene is much more extensive than originally thought. Other targets of transcription have been researched without correlation to FOXP2. Specifically, FOXP2 has been investigated in correlation with autism and dyslexia, however with no mutation was discovered as the cause. One well identified target is language. Although some research disagrees with this correlation, the majority of research shows that a mutated FOXP2 causes the observed production deficiency.

There is some evidence that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the &quot;FOXP2&quot; gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control. Brain imaging of affected individuals indicates functional abnormalities in language-related cortical and basal ganglia regions, demonstrating that the problems extend beyond the motor system.

Mutations in FOXP2 are among several (26 genes plus 2 intergenic) loci which correlate to ADHD diagnosis in adults – clinical ADHD is an umbrella label for a heterogeneous group of genetic and neurological phenomena which may result from FOXP2 mutations or other causes.

A 2020 genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicates single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FOXP2 in susceptibility to cannabis use disorder.

=== Language disorder ===
It is theorized that the translocation of the 7q31.2 region of the FOXP2 gene causes a severe language impairment called developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD) or childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) So far this type of mutation has only been discovered in three families across the world including the original KE family. A missense mutation causing an arginine-to-histidine substitution (R553H) in the DNA-binding domain is thought to be the abnormality in KE. This would cause a normally basic residue to be fairly acidic and highly reactive at the body&#x27;s pH. A heterozygous nonsense mutation, R328X variant, produces a truncated protein involved in speech and language difficulties in one KE individual and two of their close family members. R553H and R328X mutations also affected nuclear localization, DNA-binding, and the transactivation (increased gene expression) properties of FOXP2.

These individuals present with deletions, translocations, and missense mutations. When tasked with repetition and verb generation, these individuals with DVD/CAS had decreased activation in the putamen and Broca&#x27;s area in fMRI studies. These areas are commonly known as areas of language function. This is one of the primary reasons that FOXP2 is known as a language gene. They have delayed onset of speech, difficulty with articulation including slurred speech, stuttering, and poor pronunciation, as well as dyspraxia. It is believed that a major part of this speech deficit comes from an inability to coordinate the movements necessary to produce normal speech including mouth and tongue shaping. Additionally, there are more general impairments with the processing of the grammatical and linguistic aspects of speech. These findings suggest that the effects of FOXP2 are not limited to motor control, as they include comprehension among other cognitive language functions. General mild motor and cognitive deficits are noted across the board. Clinically these patients can also have difficulty coughing, sneezing, or clearing their throats.

While FOXP2 has been proposed to play a critical role in the development of speech and language, this view has been challenged by the fact that the gene is also expressed in other mammals as well as birds and fish that do not speak. It has also been proposed that the FOXP2 transcription-factor is not so much a hypothetical &#x27;language gene&#x27; but rather part of a regulatory machinery related to externalization of speech.

== Evolution ==
The &quot;FOXP2&quot; gene is highly conserved in mammals. The human gene differs from that in non-human primates by the substitution of two amino acids, a threonine to asparagine substitution at position 303 (T303N) and an asparagine to serine substitution at position 325 (N325S). In mice it differs from that of humans by three substitutions, and in zebra finch by seven amino acids. One of the two amino acid differences between human and chimps also arose independently in carnivores and bats. Similar &quot;FOXP2&quot; proteins can be found in songbirds, fish, and reptiles such as alligators.

DNA sampling from &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; bones indicates that their &quot;FOXP2&quot; gene is a little different though largely similar to those of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (i.e. humans). Previous genetic analysis had suggested that the &quot;H. sapiens&quot; FOXP2 gene became fixed in the population around 125,000 years ago. Some researchers consider the Neanderthal findings to indicate that the gene instead swept through the population over 260,000 years ago, before our most recent common ancestor with the Neanderthals. Other researchers offer alternative explanations for how the &quot;H. sapiens&quot; version would have appeared in Neanderthals living 43,000 years ago.

According to a 2002 study, the &quot;FOXP2&quot; gene showed indications of recent positive selection. Some researchers have speculated that positive selection is crucial for the evolution of language in humans. Others, however, were unable to find a clear association between species with learned vocalizations and similar mutations in &quot;FOXP2&quot;. A 2018 analysis of a large sample of globally distributed genomes confirmed there was no evidence of positive selection, suggesting that the original signal of positive selection may be driven by sample composition. Insertion of both human mutations into mice, whose version of &quot;FOXP2&quot; otherwise differs from the human and chimpanzee versions in only one additional base pair, causes changes in vocalizations as well as other behavioral changes, such as a reduction in exploratory tendencies, and a decrease in maze learning time. A reduction in dopamine levels and changes in the morphology of certain nerve cells are also observed.

== Interactions ==
FOXP2 is known to regulate &quot;CNTNAP2&quot;, &quot;CTBP1&quot;, &quot;SRPX2&quot; and &quot;SCN3A&quot;.

FOXP2 downregulates &quot;CNTNAP2&quot;, a member of the neurexin family found in neurons. &quot;CNTNAP2&quot; is associated with common forms of language impairment.

FOXP2 also downregulates &quot;SRPX2&quot;, the &#x27;Sushi Repeat-containing Protein X-linked 2&#x27;. It directly reduces its expression, by binding to its gene&#x27;s promoter. SRPX2 is involved in glutamatergic synapse formation in the cerebral cortex and is more highly expressed in childhood. SRPX2 appears to specifically increase the number of glutamatergic synapses in the brain, while leaving inhibitory GABAergic synapses unchanged and not affecting dendritic spine length or shape. On the other hand, FOXP2&#x27;s activity does reduce dendritic spine length and shape, in addition to number, indicating it has other regulatory roles in dendritic morphology.

== In other animals ==

=== Chimpanzees ===
In chimpanzees, FOXP2 differs from the human version by two amino acids. A study in Germany sequenced FOXP2&#x27;s complementary DNA in chimps and other species to compare it with human complementary DNA in order to find the specific changes in the sequence. FOXP2 was found to be functionally different in humans compared to chimps. Since FOXP2 was also found to have an effect on other genes, its effects on other genes is also being studied. Researchers deduced that there could also be further clinical applications in the direction of these studies in regards to illnesses that show effects on human language ability.

=== Mice ===
In a mouse &quot;FOXP2&quot; gene knockouts, loss of both copies of the gene causes severe motor impairment related to cerebellar abnormalities and lack of ultrasonic vocalisations normally elicited when pups are removed from their mothers. These vocalizations have important communicative roles in mother–offspring interactions. Loss of one copy was associated with impairment of ultrasonic vocalisations and a modest developmental delay. Male mice on encountering female mice produce complex ultrasonic vocalisations that have characteristics of song. Mice that have the R552H point mutation carried by the KE family show cerebellar reduction and abnormal synaptic plasticity in striatal and cerebellar circuits.

Humanized FOXP2 mice display altered cortico-basal ganglia circuits. The human allele of the FOXP2 gene was transferred into the mouse embryos through homologous recombination to create humanized FOXP2 mice. The human variant of FOXP2 also had an effect on the exploratory behavior of the mice. In comparison to knockout mice with one non-functional copy of &quot;FOXP2&quot;, the humanized mouse model showed opposite effects when testing its effect on the levels of dopamine, plasticity of synapses, patterns of expression in the striatum and behavior that was exploratory in nature.

When FOXP2 expression was altered in mice, it affected many different processes including the learning motor skills and the plasticity of synapses. Additionally, FOXP2 is found more in the sixth layer of the cortex than in the fifth, and this is consistent with it having greater roles in sensory integration. FOXP2 was also found in the medial geniculate nucleus of the mouse brain, which is the processing area that auditory inputs must go through in the thalamus. It was found that its mutations play a role in delaying the development of language learning. It was also found to be highly expressed in the Purkinje cells and cerebellar nuclei of the cortico-cerebellar circuits. High FOXP2 expression has also been shown in the spiny neurons that express type 1 dopamine receptors in the striatum, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus and ventral tegmental area. The negative effects of the mutations of FOXP2 in these brain regions on motor abilities were shown in mice through tasks in lab studies. When analyzing the brain circuitry in these cases, scientists found greater levels of dopamine and decreased lengths of dendrites, which caused defects in long-term depression, which is implicated in motor function learning and maintenance. Through EEG studies, it was also found that these mice had increased levels of activity in their striatum, which contributed to these results. There is further evidence for mutations of targets of the FOXP2 gene shown to have roles in schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism, bipolar disorder and intellectual disabilities.

=== Bats ===
&quot;FOXP2&quot; has implications in the development of bat echolocation. Contrary to apes and mice, &quot;FOXP2&quot; is extremely diverse in echolocating bats. Twenty-two sequences of non-bat eutherian mammals revealed a total number of 20 nonsynonymous mutations in contrast to half that number of bat sequences, which showed 44 nonsynonymous mutations. All cetaceans share three amino acid substitutions, but no differences were found between echolocating toothed whales and non-echolocating baleen cetaceans. Within bats, however, amino acid variation correlated with different echolocating types.

=== Birds ===
In songbirds, &quot;FOXP2&quot; most likely regulates genes involved in neuroplasticity. Gene knockdown of &quot;FOXP2&quot; in area X of the basal ganglia in songbirds results in incomplete and inaccurate song imitation. Overexpression of &quot;FOXP2&quot; was accomplished through injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) into area X of the brain. This overexpression produced similar effects to that of knockdown; juvenile zebra finch birds were unable to accurately imitate their tutors. Similarly, in adult canaries, higher &quot;FOXP2&quot; levels also correlate with song changes.

Levels of &quot;FOXP2&quot; in adult zebra finches are significantly higher when males direct their song to females than when they sing song in other contexts. &quot;Directed&quot; singing refers to when a male is singing to a female usually for a courtship display. &quot;Undirected&quot; singing occurs when for example, a male sings when other males are present or is alone. Studies have found that FoxP2 levels vary depending on the social context. When the birds were singing undirected song, there was a decrease of FoxP2 expression in Area X. This downregulation was not observed and FoxP2 levels remained stable in birds singing directed song.

Differences between song-learning and non-song-learning birds have been shown to be caused by differences in &quot;FOXP2&quot; gene expression, rather than differences in the amino acid sequence of the &quot;FOXP2&quot; protein.

=== Zebrafish ===
In zebrafish, FOXP2 is expressed in the ventral and dorsal thalamus, telencephalon, diencephalon where it likely plays a role in nervous system development. The zebrafish FOXP2 gene has an 85% similarity to the human FOX2P ortholog.

== History ==
&quot;FOXP2&quot; and its gene were discovered as a result of investigations on an English family known as the KE family, half of whom (15 individuals across three generations) had a speech and language disorder called developmental verbal dyspraxia. Their case was studied at the Institute of Child Health of University College London. In 1990, Myrna Gopnik, Professor of Linguistics at McGill University, reported that the disorder-affected KE family had severe speech impediment with incomprehensible talk, largely characterized by grammatical deficits. She hypothesized that the basis was not of learning or cognitive disability, but due to genetic factors affecting mainly grammatical ability. (Her hypothesis led to a popularised existence of &quot;grammar gene&quot; and a controversial notion of grammar-specific disorder.) In 1995, the University of Oxford and the Institute of Child Health researchers found that the disorder was purely genetic. Remarkably, the inheritance of the disorder from one generation to the next was consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance, i.e., mutation of only a single gene on an autosome (non-sex chromosome) acting in a dominant fashion. This is one of the few known examples of Mendelian (monogenic) inheritance for a disorder affecting speech and language skills, which typically have a complex basis involving multiple genetic risk factors.
In 1998, Oxford University geneticists Simon Fisher, Anthony Monaco, Cecilia S. L. Lai, Jane A. Hurst, and Faraneh Vargha-Khadem identified an autosomal dominant monogenic inheritance that is localized on a small region of chromosome 7 from DNA samples taken from the affected and unaffected members. The chromosomal region (locus) contained 70 genes. The locus was given the official name &quot;SPCH1&quot; (for speech-and-language-disorder-1) by the Human Genome Nomenclature committee. Mapping and sequencing of the chromosomal region was performed with the aid of bacterial artificial chromosome clones. Around this time, the researchers identified an individual who was unrelated to the KE family but had a similar type of speech and language disorder. In this case, the child, known as CS, carried a chromosomal rearrangement (a translocation) in which part of chromosome 7 had become exchanged with part of chromosome 5. The site of breakage of chromosome 7 was located within the SPCH1 region.

In 2001, the team identified in CS that the mutation is in the middle of a protein-coding gene. Using a combination of bioinformatics and RNA analyses, they discovered that the gene codes for a novel protein belonging to the forkhead-box (FOX) group of transcription factors. As such, it was assigned with the official name of FOXP2. When the researchers sequenced the &quot;FOXP2&quot; gene in the KE family, they found a heterozygous point mutation shared by all the affected individuals, but not in unaffected members of the family and other people. This mutation is due to an amino-acid substitution that inhibits the DNA-binding domain of the &quot;FOXP2&quot; protein. Further screening of the gene identified multiple additional cases of &quot;FOXP2&quot; disruption, including different point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, providing evidence that damage to one copy of this gene is sufficient to derail speech and language development.

<doc id="184424" wikidata="Q1153267" url="?curid=184424" title="Vega 1">
<text>Vega 1 (along with its twin Vega 2) was a Soviet space probe, part of the Vega program. The spacecraft was a development of the earlier &quot;Venera&quot; craft. They were designed by Babakin Space Centre and constructed as [[5VK]] by Lavochkin at Khimki. The name VeGa (ВеГа) combines the first two letters from the Russian words for Venus (Венера: &quot;Venera&quot;) and Halley (Галлея: &quot;Galleya&quot;).

The craft was powered by twin large solar panels and instruments included an antenna dish, cameras, spectrometer, infrared sounder, magnetometers (MISCHA), and plasma probes. The craft was launched by a Proton-K rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Tyuratam, Kazakh SSR. Both Vega 1 and 2 were three-axis stabilized spacecraft. The spacecraft were equipped with a dual bumper shield for dust protection from Halley&#x27;s comet.

== Venus mission ==
The descent module arrived at Venus on 11 June 1985, two days after being released from the Vega 1 flyby probe. The module, a sphere with a diameter of , contained a surface lander and a balloon explorer. The flyby probe performed a gravitational assist maneuver using Venus, and continued its mission to intercept the comet.

===Descent craft===

The surface lander was identical to that of Vega 2 as well as six previous &quot;Venera&quot; missions. The objective of the probe was the study of the atmosphere and the exposed surface of the planet. The scientific payload included an ultraviolet spectrometer, temperature and pressure sensors, a water concentration meter, a gas-phase chromatograph, an X-ray spectrometer, a mass spectrometer, and a surface sampling device. Since the probe made a nighttime landing, no images were taken. Several of these scientific tools (the UV spectrometer, the mass spectrograph, and the devices to measure pressure and temperature) were developed in collaboration with French scientists.

The lander successfully touched down at in the Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra. Due to excessive turbulence, some surface experiments were inadvertently activated above the surface. Only the mass spectrometer was able to return data.

Tools on the lander include:
* Thermometers
* Barometers
* UV absorption spectrometer—ISAV-S
* Optical aerosol analyzer, Nephelometer—ISAV-A
* Aerosol particle-size counter—LSA
* Aerosol mass spectrometer—MALAKHIT-M 
* Aerosol gas chromatograph—SIGMA-3
* Aerosol X-ray fluorescence spectrometer—IFP
* Hygrometer—VM-4
* Soil X-ray fluorescence spectrometer—BDRP-AM25 
* Gamma-ray spectrometer—GS-15STsV
* Penetrometer / Soil ohmmeter—Prop-V
* Stabilized oscillator / Doppler radio

===Balloon===
The Vega 1 Lander/Balloon capsule entered the Venusian atmosphere ( altitude) at 2:06:10 UT (Earth received time; Moscow time 5:06:10 a.m.) on 11 June 1985 at roughly . At approximately 2:06:25 UT the parachute attached to the landing craft cap opened at an altitude of . The cap and parachute were released 15 seconds later at altitude. The balloon package was pulled out of its compartment by parachute 40 seconds later at altitude, at 8.1 degrees N, 176.9 degrees east. A second parachute opened at an altitude of , 200 seconds after entry, extracting the furled balloon. The balloon was inflated 100 seconds later at and the parachute and inflation system were jettisoned. The ballast was jettisoned when the balloon reached roughly and the balloon floated back to a stable height between some 15 to 25 minutes after entry.

The mean stable height was , with a pressure of and a temperature of in the middle, most active layer of the Venus three-tiered cloud system. The balloon drifted westward in the zonal wind flow with an average speed of about () at nearly constant latitude. The probe crossed the terminator from night to day at 12:20 UT on 12 June after traversing . The probe continued to operate in the daytime until the final transmission was received at 00:38 UT on 13 June from 8.1 N, 68.8 E after a total traverse distance of or about 30% of the circumference of the planet. It is not known how much farther the balloon traveled after the final communication.

== Halley mission ==
After their encounters, the Vegas&#x27; motherships used the gravity of Venus, also known as a gravity assist, to intercept Halley&#x27;s Comet.

Images started to be returned on 4 March 1986, and were used to help pinpoint Giotto&#x27;s close flyby of the comet. The early images from Vega showed two bright areas on the comet, which were initially interpreted as a double nucleus. The bright areas would later turn out to be two jets emitting from the comet. The images also showed the nucleus to be dark, and the infrared spectrometer readings measured a nucleus temperature of , much warmer than expected for an ice body. The conclusion was that the comet had a thin layer on its surface covering an icy body.

Vega 1 made its closest approach on 6 March at around (at 07:20:06 UT) of the nucleus. It took more than 500 pictures via different filters as it flew through the gas cloud around the coma. Although the spacecraft was battered by dust, none of the instruments were disabled during the encounter.

The data intensive examination of the comet covered only the three hours around closest approach. They were intended to measure the physical parameters of the nucleus, such as dimensions, shape, temperature and surface properties, as well as to study the structure and dynamics of the coma, the gas composition close to the nucleus, the dust particles&#x27; composition and mass distribution as functions of distance to the nucleus and the cometary-solar wind interaction.

The Vega images showed the nucleus to be about long with a rotation period of about 53 hours. The dust mass spectrometer detected material similar to the composition of carbonaceous chondrites meteorites and also detected clathrate ice.

After subsequent imaging sessions on 7 and 8 March 1986, Vega 1 headed out to deep space. In total Vega 1 and Vega 2 returned about 1500 images of Comet Halley. Vega 1 ran out of attitude control propellant on 30 January 1987, and contact with Vega 2 continued until 24 March 1987.

Vega 1 is currently in heliocentric orbit, with perihelion of 0.70 AU, aphelion of 0.98 AU, eccentricity of 0.17, inclination of 2.3 degrees and orbital period of 281 days.

<doc id="184426" wikidata="Q3461202" url="?curid=184426" title="Saducismus Triumphatus">
<text>Saducismus triumphatus is a book on witchcraft by Joseph Glanvill, published posthumously in England in 1681.

The editor is presumed to have been Henry More, who certainly contributed to the volume; and topical material on witchcraft in Sweden was supplied by Anthony Horneck to later editions. By 1683 this appeared as a lengthy appendix. Horneck&#x27;s contribution came from a Dutch pamphlet of 1670. Its composition is mentioned in the chapter on Transportation by an invisible power in the Miscellanies of John Aubrey.

The book affirmed the existence of witches with supernatural powers of magic, and attacked skepticism concerning their abilities. Glanvill likened these skeptics to the Sadducees, members of a Jewish sect from around the time of Jesus who were said to have denied the immortality of the soul. The book is also noted for the account of the Drummer of Tedworth, an early poltergeist story, and for one of the earliest descriptions of the use of a witch bottle, a countercharm against witchcraft.
==Influence==

The book strongly influenced Cotton Mather in his &quot;Discourse on Witchcraft&quot; (1689) and the Salem witch trials held in 1692–3 in Salem, Massachusetts. Mather&#x27;s &quot;Wonders of the Invisible World&quot; (1693) is largely modelled after this book and its reports, particularly the material relating to the Mora witch trial of 1669. Shirley Jackson quoted passages from the book in her short story collection &quot;The Lottery and Other Stories&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The book is mentioned in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s short story &quot;The Festival&quot;:

&quot;Pointing to a chair, table, and pile of books, the old man now left the room; and when I sat down to read I saw that the books were hoary and mouldy, and that they included old Morryster’s wild Marvells of Science, the terrible Saducismus Triumphatus of Joseph Glanvill, published in 1681, the shocking Daemonolatreia of Remigius, printed in 1595 at Lyons, and worst of all, the unmentionable Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, in Olaus Wormius’ forbidden Latin translation; a book which I had never seen, but of which I had heard monstrous things whispered.&quot;

<text>The de Havilland Aircraft Company Limited () was a British aviation manufacturer established in late 1920 by Geoffrey de Havilland at Stag Lane Aerodrome Edgware on the outskirts of north London. Operations were later moved to Hatfield in Hertfordshire.

Known for its innovation, de Havilland was responsible for a number of important aircraft, including the Moth biplane which revolutionised aviation in the 1920s; the 1930s Fox Moth, a commercial light passenger aircraft; the wooden World War II Mosquito multirole aircraft; and the pioneering passenger jet airliner Comet.

The de Havilland company became a member of the Hawker Siddeley group in 1960, but lost its separate identity in 1963. Later, Hawker Siddeley merged into what is eventually known today as BAE Systems, the British aerospace and defence business. The de Havilland name lives on in de Havilland Canada, which owns the rights to the name and the aircraft produced by de Havilland&#x27;s former Canadian subsidiary, including the Dash 8 regional airliner previously produced by Bombardier Aerospace.

==History==
===Origins===
In January 1920, Geoffrey de Havilland was working for Airco as technical director and chief designer. Airco were in poor financial position after the war with a lack of demand for civilian aircraft. BSA bought Airco on 20 January 1920 from George Holt Thomas on the say-so of one BSA director, Percy Martin, in order to acquire their factories and equipment, BSA having no interest in aviation. The resulting losses were so great BSA was unable to pay a dividend for the next three years. 

With Thomas&#x27;s help, de Havilland took modest premises at the nearby Stag Lane Aerodrome and formed a limited liability company, de Havilland Aircraft Company Limited, incorporated 26 September 1920. The directors were de Havilland, Arthur Edwin Turner who had come from the War Office, and chief engineer Charles Clement Walker. Nominal capital was £50,000. Most of the capital came from Geoffrey de Havilland (£3,000) and George Holt Thomas (£10,000), with various others adding a further £1,000. As well as securing release from any contractual obligations to BSA, alongside other Airco assets de Havilland bought the Airco DH.18, two DH.14s and repair work on the DH.9 from BSA. Thomas contribution was contingent on A E Turner, Airco&#x27;s financial manager, becoming chairman.

Banking on an order worth about £2,500 originally intended for Airco de Havilland brought his close-knit team in from Airco: friends Charles Clement Walker (aerodynamics and stressing), Wilfred E. Nixon (company secretary), Francis E. N. St. Barbe (business and sales) and from Airco&#x27;s experimental department, Frank T Hearle (works manager). Hugh Burroughes went to the Gloster Aircraft Company. The fledgling enterprise was lucky to be approached the next year by a man wanting a new aeroplane built for him, Alan Samuel Butler. He invested heavily in the business. The first year&#x27;s turnover was £32,782 and net profit £2,387 and in early 1922 they bought Stag Lane aerodrome for £20,000. They survived until 1925 when de Havilland&#x27;s own design, the Moth (first flown 22 February 1925) proved to be just what the flying world was waiting for. In 1928, de Havilland Aircraft Company Limited went public.

Initially de Havilland concentrated on single and two-seat biplanes, continuing the DH line of aircraft built by Airco but adapting them for airline use, but then they introduced a series of smaller aircraft powered by de Havilland&#x27;s own Gipsy engines. These included the Gipsy Moth and Tiger Moth. These aircraft set many aviation records, many piloted by de Havilland himself. Amy Johnson flew solo from England to Australia in a Gipsy Moth in 1930.

The Moth series of aeroplanes continued with the more refined Hornet Moth, with enclosed accommodation, and the Moth Minor, a low-wing monoplane constructed of wood. One of de Havilland&#x27;s trademarks was that the name of the aircraft type was painted on using a particularly elegant Roman typeface, all in capital letters. When there was a strike at the plant, the artisans who painted the name on the planes used the same typeface to make the workers&#x27; protest signs.

The DH.84 Dragon was the first aeroplane purchased by Aer Lingus in 1936; they later operated the DH.86B Dragon Express and the DH.89 Dragon Rapide. De Havilland continued to produce high-performance aircraft including the twin piston-engined DH.88 Comet racers, one of which became famous as the winner of the MacRobertson Air Race from England to Australia in 1934.

===Second World War===
The high-performance designs and wooden construction methods culminated in the Mosquito, constructed primarily of wood, which avoided use of strategic materials such as aluminium during the Second World War. The company followed this with the even higher-performing Hornet fighter, which was one of the pioneers of the use of metal-wood and metal-metal bonding techniques.

In 1937 de Havilland set up a factory at what is now known as De Havilland Way in Lostock to produce variable pitch propellers for the RAF. The site was of strategic importance and became a German Luftwaffe target. On 3 July 1942 two Ju 88 bombers attempted a low-altitude bombing raid, using the Rivington reservoir chain to navigate but the mission went off course.

===After the war===
After the Second World War de Havilland continued with advanced designs in both the military and civil fields, but several public disasters doomed the company as an independent entity. The experimental tailless jet-powered de Havilland DH.108 Swallow crashed in the Thames Estuary, killing Geoffrey de Havilland Jr., son of the company&#x27;s founder. A large additional aircraft factory was acquired in 1948 at Hawarden Airport at Broughton near Chester, where production supplemented the Hatfield output. The de Havilland Comet was put into service in 1952 as the eagerly anticipated first commercial jet airliner, twice as fast as previous alternatives and a source of British national pride. Operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation, on 2 May 1952 the flight registered G-ALYP took off with fare-paying passengers and inaugurated scheduled service from London to Johannesburg. Powered by four de Havilland Ghost jet engines, the Comet could reach speeds of 500 miles per hour (halving journey times around the world), and fly at an altitude of 40,000 feet, a performance previously the preserve of military jet fighters. Twenty months after the launch, there were 17 Comets in service. The Comet suffered three high-profile crashes in two years. Two of these were found to be caused by structural failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframe, a phenomenon not fully understood at the time; the other was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe weather. Sir Arnold Hall led the RAE research team that made the discovery that the rivets punched into the metal caused a minute fatigue crack.

Because of the structural problems of the Comet, in 1954 all remaining examples were withdrawn from service, with de Havilland launching a major effort to build a new version that would be both larger and stronger. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned, with oval windows, structural reinforcements and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the lessons learned from the Comet while developing their own aircraft. The Comet 4 enabled the de Havilland airliner to return to the skies in 1958. By then the United States had its Boeing 707 jet and the Douglas DC-8, both of which were faster and more economical to operate. Orders for the Comet dried up.

Hawker Siddeley bought de Havilland in 1960 but kept it as a separate company until 1963. In that year it became the de Havilland Division of Hawker Siddeley Aviation and all types in production or development changed their designations from &quot;DH&quot; to &quot;HS&quot;. De Havilland&#x27;s final designs became the Hawker Siddeley Trident (originally the DH.121) and the innovative Hawker Siddeley HS.125, originally the DH.125.

The DH.121 design was modified to be smaller to fit the needs of one airline—British European Airways. Other airlines found it unattractive and turned to a rival tri-jet, the Boeing 727 which was much the same size as the initial DH.121 design. De Havilland, as Hawker Siddeley, built only 117 Tridents, while Boeing went on to sell over 1,800 727s.

De Havilland also entered the field of long-range missiles, developing the liquid-fuelled Blue Streak. It did not enter military service, but became the first stage of Europa, a launch vehicle for use in space flight. In flight tests, the Blue Streak performed well but the upper stages, built in France and Germany, repeatedly failed. In 1973, the Europa programme was cancelled, with Blue Streak dying as well.

===de Havilland Canada===

de Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd. was formed in 1928 to build de Havilland aircraft for the Canadian market, in some cases adapted to suit to the harsh Canadian environment. When World War II arrived, this set-up was ready made to expand production to augment British aircraft factories, without any possible threat from enemy bombers. After the war de Havilland Canada developed its own range of designs, identified as DHC-1 through to DHC-8, which were also often tailor-made for Canadian use, but as rugged and/or STOL designs, also found markets in other environments. DHC became a Canadian Crown Corporation during the war, was sold to Boeing in December 1985, then on to Bombardier Aerospace in 1992. 

In November 2018, Longview Aviation Capital Corp. acquired the Dash 8 programme and the de Havilland Canada brand from Bombardier, adding them to the rights and type certificates for all of the out-of-production aircraft (DHC-1 through DHC-7) already sold to its subsidiary Viking Air in 2005. The deal, which closed on 3 June 2019 following regulatory approval, brought the entire de Havilland Canada product line under the same banner for the first time in decades, under a new holding company bearing a name almost identical to the original, De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited.

===de Havilland Australia===
The first overseas subsidiary was set up in Australia in March 1927 as de Havilland Aircraft Pty. Ltd. The company moved from Melbourne to Sydney during 1930 where it acted as an agency for the parent company, with assembly, repair and spares facilities for the company&#x27;s popular sporting and airliner types. Aircraft design and full manufacture by de Havilland Australia (DHA) did not take place until the Second World War, when the company began production of the DH.82 Tiger Moth primary trainer at Bankstown, NSW.

During the Second World War, DHA designed a small troop-carrying glider to be used if Australia was invaded by Japan. The DH-G1 emerged in mid-1942 and used the DH.84 Dragon forward fuselage, 87 of which were in production at the same factory as navigational trainers. The two built served as prototypes for the definitive DH-G2 produced the following year but the need had passed by this time and only six DH-G2s were built. The company also began to manufacture the Mosquito, with deliveries to the RAAF being first made in 1944. A total of 212 Mosquitos were built at Bankstown between 1943 and 1948. Some of these aircraft continued in RAAF service until 1953.

Licensed production of the de Havilland Vampire began in 1948, with the first of 190 built flying in 1949.

Another DHA design, the de Havilland Australia DHA-3 Drover, was manufactured between 1948 and 1953. Only 20 were produced, mostly for the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS), Trans Australia Airlines and Qantas. The DHA-3 Drover was a three-engined light transport derived from the DH.104 Dove, capable of carrying six to eight passengers. It was designed as a replacement for the DH.84 Dragon, which was common in Australia due to its wartime production by DHA. The engine chosen for the new design was the de Havilland Gipsy Major Mk-10 4s. Several Drovers were later re-engined with more powerful Lycoming O-360 horizontally-opposed engines to improve performance.

In 1959 a boat building division known as de Havilland Marine was established at the Bankstown factory.

The de Havilland Australia concern was purchased by Boeing Australia and was renamed Hawker de Havilland Aerospace. On 6 February 2009, Boeing announced that Hawker de Havilland Aerospace had changed its name to Boeing Aerostructures Australia.

===de Havilland New Zealand===
To meet the demand for Tiger Moth trainers for the Royal New Zealand Air Force and potentially for RAF training to be conducted in New Zealand, the de Havilland (New Zealand) Company Limited was established in March 1939, and work commenced on New Zealand&#x27;s first aircraft factory at Rongotai. After World War II, the company undertook maintenance and refurbishment work until taken over by Hawker Siddeley International NZ Ltd in 1964. The site of the factory is now part of Wellington International Airport.

===de Havilland Engines===
As well as a prolific aircraft builder, de Havilland was also a significant producer of aero engines. This went against usual practice: usually engines are designed and produced by a dedicated company though in the UK the Bristol Aeroplane Company had a substantial engine business and Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft was part of the same business as Armstrong Siddeley The successful &quot;Gipsy&quot; and the later developments such as the Gipsy Major were successful and popular power units, being used in nearly all of de Havilland&#x27;s light designs and several aircraft from other manufacturers. Gipsy engines were relatively unusual by the 1930s/40s because they were in-line engines, at a time when radial or opposed-action engine layouts were more popular. The de Havilland company was also a competitor to Rolls-Royce and Metrovick in the early years of jet engine development. Employing the services of Frank Halford then buying out his company they produced the de Havilland Goblin and de Havilland Ghost engines for first their jet fighters then the Comet.

===de Havilland Propellers===
A company set up in 1935 for the manufacture of Hamilton Standard propellers under licence, and which later produced guided and other missiles such as the Firestreak and Blue Streak.

=== Key technical staff ===

==Legacy==
The de Havilland company donated a site to Hertfordshire County Council for educational use: the site was then developed as Hatfield Technical College, which is now the College Lane Campus of the University of Hertfordshire. De Havilland was purchased by Hawker Siddeley in 1960 and merged into British Aerospace in 1978. The BAE site then closed in 1993, and the University of Hertfordshire purchased part of the site for the de Havilland Campus. Hatfield&#x27;s aerospace history is recorded today in the names of local streets, such as Comet Way and Dragon Road.

In September 2003 part of the former British aerospace site became the de Havilland campus of the University of Hertfordshire.

<doc id="184433" wikidata="Q181036" url="?curid=184433" title="Hyperbole">
<text>Hyperbole (; adj. hyperbolic ) is the use of exaggeration as a rhetorical device or figure of speech. In rhetoric, it is also sometimes known as auxesis (literally &#x27;growth&#x27;). In poetry and oratory, it emphasizes, evokes strong feelings, and creates strong impressions. As a figure of speech, it is usually not meant to be taken literally.

== Etymology ==
&#x27;Hyperbole&#x27; is derived from the &quot;huperbolḗ&quot; by way of Latin. The word is composed from &quot;hupér&quot; &#x27;above, beyond&#x27; and &quot;bállō&quot; &#x27;throw&#x27;.

Unlike most English words beginning with &quot;hyper-&quot;, it is stressed on the second syllable. The first known use is in the 15th century.

==Usage==
Hyperbole is often used for emphasis or effect. In casual speech, it functions as an intensifier: saying &quot;the bag weighed a ton&quot; simply means that the bag was extremely heavy. The rhetorical device may be used for serious or ironic or comic effects. Understanding hyperbole and its use in context can help understand the speaker&#x27;s point. Hyperbole generally conveys feelings or emotions from the speaker, or from those who the speaker may talk about. It can be used in a form of humor, excitement, distress, and many other emotions, all depending on the context in which the speaker uses it.

=== In popular culture ===
Hyperbole is one of the most widely recognized and used forms of figurative language in everyday life. It is used heavily in advertising and entertainment. Advertisers use hyperbole to exaggerate the benefits of products to boost sales. Repetitive hyperbole is used in public relations to increase the popularity of a person or product. It is also used in propaganda, giving it a bad reputation.

=== US case law ===
Rhetorical hyperbole is defined as &quot;extravagant exaggeration employed for rhetorical effect&quot; for First Amendment purposes. Greenbelt Cooperative Pub. Ass&#x27;n v. Bresler (1970), Letter Carriers v. Austin (1974) and Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. (1989) are notable cases. In Watts v. United States (1969) the defendant was absolved of federal anti-threat punishment for saying &quot;the first person he would put in his scope is L.B.J.&quot;; the court found this to be &quot;political hyperbole&quot;.

=== In literature ===
Hyperbole has been used throughout literature for many centuries. Heroic drama, which is drama with an emphasis on grandeur and excess, often makes use of hyperbole to extend the effect and epic nature of the genre. Modern tall tales also make use of hyperbole to exaggerate the feats and characteristics of their protagonists. For example, the American tall tale about Paul Bunyan relies heavily on hyperbole to establish Bunyan&#x27;s giant stature and abilities.

For hyperbole to be effective it needs to be obvious, deliberate, and outlandish. Using hyperbolic speech as a character trait can denote an unreliable narrator.

Emerson&#x27;s &quot;Concord Hymn&quot; uses hyperbole in the lines &quot;Here once the embattled farmers stood / And fired the shot heard round the world.&quot;

In Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;, the protagonist emerges from his shelter to find total destruction, and makes the hyperbolic statement that &quot;Dresden was like the moon now, nothing but minerals.&quot; The hyperbole conveys how completely the city was ruined.

=== Literally ===
One of the most frequently used hyperboles in English is the word &quot;literally&quot;. It became a controversial issue when millennials began to convolute &quot;literally&quot; by using the word to artificially substantiate a position. Many dictionaries now document the meaning as &quot;to acknowledge that something is not literally true but is used for emphasis or to express strong feeling&quot;. Hence, &quot;literally&quot; has become one of the primary ways to exaggerate and hyperbolize a statement.

=== Common examples ===

* He was so angry, I thought he was going to kill somebody.
* She had a thousand missed calls.
* I was so embarrassed, I wanted to die.

<text>Carolyn Janice Cherry (born September 1, 1942), better known by the pen name C. J. Cherryh, is an American writer of speculative fiction. She has written more than 80 books since the mid-1970s, including the Hugo Award–winning novels &quot;Downbelow Station&quot; (1981) and &quot;Cyteen&quot; (1988), both set in her Alliance–Union universe, and her &quot;Foreigner&quot; series. She is known for worldbuilding, depicting fictional realms with great realism supported by vast research in history, language, psychology, and archeology.

Cherryh (pronounced &quot;Cherry&quot;) appended a silent &quot;h&quot; to her real name because editor Donald A. Wollheim felt &quot;Cherry&quot; sounded too much like a romance writer. She used only her initials, C. J., to disguise that she was female at a time when the majority of science fiction authors were male.

The asteroid 77185 Cherryh is named in the author&#x27;s honor. The asteroid&#x27;s discoverers wrote of Cherryh: &quot;She has challenged us to be worthy of the stars by imagining how mankind might grow to live among them.&quot;

==Biography==

Cherryh was born in 1942 in St. Louis, Missouri and raised primarily in Lawton, Oklahoma. She began writing stories at the age of ten when she became frustrated with the cancellation of her favorite TV show, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. In 1964, she received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Latin from the University of Oklahoma (Phi Beta Kappa), with academic specializations in archaeology, mythology, and the history of engineering. In 1965, she received a Master of Arts degree in classics from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where she was a Woodrow Wilson fellow. In the early 1980’s, she was an artist in residence at the University of Central Oklahoma.

After graduation, Cherryh taught Latin, Ancient Greek, the classics, and ancient history at John Marshall High School in the Oklahoma City public school system. While her job was teaching Latin, her passion was the history, religion, and culture of Rome and Ancient Greece. During the summers, she would conduct student tours of the ancient ruins in England, France, Spain, and Italy. In her spare time, she would write, using the mythology of Rome and Greece as plots for her stories of the future. Cherryh did not follow the professional path typical of science fiction writers at the time, which was to first publish short stories in science fiction and fantasy magazines and then progress to novels; she did not consider writing short stories until she had had several novels published.

Cherryh wrote novels in her spare time away from teaching and submitted these manuscripts directly for publication. Initially, she met with little success; various publishers lost manuscripts she had submitted. She was thus forced to retype them from her own carbon copies, time-consuming but cheaper than paying for photocopying. (Using carbon paper to make at least one copy of a manuscript was standard practice until the advent of the personal computer.)

Cherryh&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1975 when Donald A. Wollheim purchased the two manuscripts she had submitted to DAW Books, &quot;Gate of Ivrel&quot; and &quot;Brothers of Earth&quot;. About the former, Cherryh stated in an interview on &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;:

It was the first time a book really found an ending and really worked, because I had made contact with Don Wollheim at DAW, found him interested, and was able to write for a specific editor whose body of work and type of story I knew. It was a good match. It was a set of characters I&#x27;d invented when I was, oh, about thirteen. So it was an old favorite of my untold stories, and ended up being the first in print.

The two novels were published in 1976, &quot;Gate of Ivrel&quot; preceding &quot;Brothers of Earth&quot; by several months (although she had completed and submitted &quot;Brothers of Earth&quot; first). The books won her immediate recognition and the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 1977.

Although not all of her works have been published by DAW Books, during this early period Cherryh developed a strong relationship with the Wollheim family and their publishing company, frequently travelling to New York City and staying with the Wollheims in their Queens family home. Other companies who have published her novels include Baen Books, HarperCollins, Warner Books, and Random House (under its Del Rey Books imprint). She published six additional novels in the late 1970s.

In 1979, her short story &quot;Cassandra&quot; won the Best Short Story Hugo, and she quit teaching to write full-time. She has since won the Hugo Award for Best Novel twice, first for &quot;Downbelow Station&quot; in 1982 and then again for &quot;Cyteen&quot; in 1989.

In addition to developing her own fictional universes, Cherryh has contributed to several shared world anthologies, including &quot;Thieves&#x27; World&quot;, &quot;Heroes in Hell&quot;, &quot;Elfquest&quot;, &quot;Witch World&quot;, &quot;Magic in Ithkar&quot;, and the &quot;Merovingen Nights&quot; series, which she edited. Her writing has encompassed a variety of science fiction and fantasy subgenres and includes a few short works of non-fiction. Her books have been translated into Czech, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish. She has also translated several published works of fiction from French into English.

She now lives near Spokane, Washington with her wife, the science fiction/fantasy author and artist Jane Fancher. She enjoys skating and travelling and regularly makes appearances at science fiction conventions.

Her brother David A. Cherry is a science fiction and fantasy artist.

==Writing style==
Cherryh uses a writing technique she has variously labeled &quot;very tight limited third person&quot;, &quot;intense third person&quot;, and &quot;intense internal&quot; voice. In this approach, the only things the writer narrates are those that the viewpoint character specifically notices or thinks about. The narration may not mention important features of the environment or situation with which the character is already familiar, even though these things might be of interest to the reader, because the character does not think about them owing to their familiarity.

==Worldbuilding==
Cherryh&#x27;s works depict fictional worlds with great realism supported by her strong background in languages, history, archaeology, and psychology. In her introduction to Cherryh&#x27;s first book, Andre Norton compared the effect of the work to Tolkien&#x27;s: &quot;Never since reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; have I been so caught up in any tale as I have been in &quot;Gate of Ivrel&quot;.&quot; Another reviewer commented, &quot;Her blend of science and folklore gives the novels an intellectual depth comparable to Tolkien or Gene Wolfe.&quot; Cherryh creates believable alien cultures, species, and perspectives, causing the reader to reconsider basic assumptions about human nature. Her worlds have been praised as complex and realistic because she presents them through implication rather than explication. She describes the difficulties of translating/expressing concepts between differing languages. This is best demonstrated in both the &quot;Chanur&quot; and &quot;Foreigner&quot; series.

She has described the process she uses to create alien societies for her fiction as being akin to asking a series of questions, and letting the answers to these questions dictate various parameters of the alien culture. In her view, &quot;culture is how biology responds to its environment and makes its living conditions better.&quot; Some of the issues she considers critical to take into account in detailing an intelligent alien race are:

* The physical environment in which the species lives
* The location and nature of the race&#x27;s dwellings, including the spatial relationships between those dwellings
* The species&#x27; diet, method(s) of obtaining and consuming food, and cultural practices regarding the preparation of meals and eating (if any)
* Processes which the aliens use to share knowledge
* Customs and ideas regarding death, dying, the treatment of the race&#x27;s dead, and the afterlife (if any)
* Metaphysical issues related to self-definition and the aliens&#x27; concept of the fictional universe they inhabit

In a 2005 interview, the interviewer asks CJ Cherryh “How much science is there in science fiction?” Cherryh responds with “Quite a bit and if I get something wrong, I know I’m going to hear about it.” 02:15 She then later goes on and states “I’ve had operational conferences with astronauts.” 3:03 

==Major themes==

Her protagonists often attempt to uphold existing social institutions and norms in the service of the greater good while the antagonists often attempt to exploit, subvert or radically alter the predominant social order for selfish gain. She uses the theme of the outsider finding his (or her) place in society and how individuals interact with The Other. A number of Cherryh&#x27;s novels focus on military and political themes. One underlying theme of her work is an exploration of gender roles. Her characters reveal both strengths and weaknesses regardless of their gender, although her female protagonists are portrayed as especially capable and determined, and many of her male characters are portrayed as damaged, abused, or otherwise vulnerable.

==Works==
Her career began with publication of her first books in 1976, &quot;Gate of Ivrel&quot; and &quot;Brothers of Earth&quot;. Since that time, she has published over 80 novels, short-story compilations, with continuing production as her blog attests. Ms. Cherryh has received the Hugo, Locus, and Prometheus Awards for some of her novels. Her novels are divided into various spheres, focusing mostly around the Alliance–Union universe, The Chanur novels, the Foreigner series, and her fantasy novels.

<text>) is the capital and most populous city of Akita Prefecture, Japan, and has been designated a core city since 1 April 1997. , the city has an estimated population of 300,502 persons in 136,628 households and a population density of 332 persons per km². The total area of the city is .

==History==
The area of present-day Akita was part of ancient Dewa Province, and has been inhabited for thousands of years. The Jizōden ruins within the city limits are a major archaeological site with artifacts from the Japanese Paleolithic period through the Jōmon and Yayoi periods. During the Nara period, the imperial court established Akita Castle in 733 AD to bring the local Emishi tribes under its control. The area was ruled by a succession of local samurai clans in the Sengoku period, before coming under the control of the Satake clan of Kubota Domain during the Edo period. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, a castle town developed around Kubota Castle.

===Meiji and Taishō Eras===
With the start of the Meiji period, Kubota Domain was abolished, and its castle town divided into the towns of Akita and Kubota. Akita Prefecture was established in 1871, and Shima Yoshitake was named the first governor. Ancient Akita District was divided into Kitaakita and Minamiakita Districts in 1878. Most of Akita town burned down in a great fire on 30 April 1886.

With the establishment of the modern municipalities system on 1 April 1889, the city of Akita was officially established, including former Kubota and Akita towns. The port area was separated into Tsuchizaki-Minato Town, which became part of Minamiakita District. The first city hall was located inside the former Minamiakita District office. In September 1898, the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s 17th Infantry Regiment was based in Akita. The first public library was opened in 1898, electrification of Tsuchizaki began in 1901, and Akita Station was opened in 1902, as well as running water and telephone services in 1907.

The Taishō period brought further development to Akita with Nippon Oil Corporation developing the nearby Kurokawa Oil Fields in 1914, and a branch of the Bank of Japan opening in Akita in 1917.

===Shōwa Era===
In 1935, Nippon Kogyo (the forerunner of Jomo) began development of the nearby Yabase Oil Fields. Akita Bank was established in 1941.

War devastated the city on 14 August 1945. During the Tsuchizaki air raid, over 250 people were killed when 134 USAAF B-29 Superfortress, attacked the city from midnight to the early dawn. A Nippon Oil oil refinery in the Tsuchizaki area was targeted.

During the post-war period, the 16th National Sports Festival of Japan was held in Akita in 1961. During the tsunami following the 1983 Sea of Japan earthquake, three Akita residents were killed.

===Heisei Era===
On 1 April 1997, Akita was designated as a core city with increased autonomy. The Akita Shinkansen began operations the same year. In August 2001, the World Games were held in Akita, with the opening ceremony held in the Yabase Track and Field Stadium. In 2004, the city celebrated its 400th anniversary and its beginnings as Kubota Castle town.

On 11 January 2005, the towns of Kawabe and Yūwa (both from Kawabe District) were merged into Akita. Kawabe District was dissolved as a result of this merger. The location of Akita City Hall did not change, and former Kawabe and Yūwa Town Halls are used as civic centers. The 62nd National Sports Festival of Japan was held in Akita in 2007.

<text>Francis Brett Young (29 June 1884 – 28 March 1954) was an English novelist, poet, playwright, composer, doctor and soldier.

==Life==

Francis Brett Young was born in Halesowen, Worcestershire. He received his early education at Iona, a private school in Sutton Coldfield. His father, Thomas Brett Young, was a doctor and his mother also came from a medical family, so it was natural that he go to the school for the sons of doctors, Epsom College. He was there when, at fourteen, he suffered the death of his beloved mother. He later went on to train at the University of Birmingham to become a qualified physician. He met his future wife, Jessie Hankinson, while he was lodging at Edgbaston in Birmingham and she was training at Anstey College of Physical Education, then housed in nearby The Leasowes (the former home of William Shenstone, the author he most admired).

He started medical practice on the steamship SS &quot;Kintuck&quot;, on a long voyage to the Far East. He returned with the money to purchase his own medical practice at Cleveland House, Brixham, Devon, in 1907. Established in his first secure job, he was able to be secretly married to Hankinson in December 1908. She was also a singer and he accompanied her, as well as composing two sets of songs for her, published in 1912 and 1913. 

His first attempt at a novel, &quot;Undergrowth&quot;, was a collaboration with his younger brother, Eric. Eric subsequently forged a writing career of his own which, while less successful, produced novels such as &quot;The Murder at Fleet&quot; and &quot;The Dancing Beggars&quot;.

During the First World War he saw service in German East Africa in the Royal Army Medical Corps (he was a medical officer of the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment), but was invalided out in 1918, and no longer able to practise medicine. His own account of these wartime events is given in his book &quot;Marching on Tanga&quot;; passages censored from that book were later covertly used in his novel &quot;Jim Redlake&quot;.

Unable to work as a doctor, he decided to devote himself to his writing, and in 1919 he began the first of his Mercian novels. From 1920, the couple went to live in Capri until 1929 but also travelled widely, including trips to South Africa, the United States and summers in the Lake District of England. They returned to live in England, initially as neighbours of fellow novelist Hugh Walpole in the Lake District. Here they lived in Esthwaite Lodge, a country house, still standing, south of Hawkshead on the west side of Esthwaite Water. Then, from 1932, they settled at the dilapidated Craycombe House, Fladbury, Worcestershire, which he was able to buy and slowly renovate due to his continuing success as a writer. His income also enabled him to spend the winters in Capri, which was vital due to his poor health. This changed as Italy became fascist and war approached, and in 1937 he purchased Talland House between Looe and Polperro as an alternative winter retreat. When war came in 1939, Craycombe House was requisitioned by the Red Cross and turned into a convalescent home for the armed services.

In 1944, near to the war&#x27;s end, he published his epic poem &quot;The Island&quot;, recounting in verse the whole history of Britain from the Bronze Age to the Battle of Britain. The entire first edition of 23,500 sold out immediately, even in wartime conditions, and was then reprinted.

The winters and wartime privations in England had taken their toll on his poor health. In October 1944, having seen &quot;The Island&quot; through to publication, he had a serious heart attack. At the end of the Second World War he moved to Montagu in the Klein Karoo, South Africa. The climate suited him, and he was even able to complete the writing of a non-fiction guide book for the South African Tourist Board.

==Death==
He died in Cape Town on 28 March 1954, aged 69. He was cremated and his ashes were returned to England, and are buried in Worcester Cathedral.

==Work==

Like many authors he used the places and occupations he knew as the backdrops for his work. There is much description of the sea, war and medical practice set in places as far apart as the West Midlands and West Country of England and South Africa. 

His first published novel &quot;Deep Sea&quot; (1914) has Brixham as a background while &quot;Portrait of Clare&quot; (1927) is set in the West Midlands, as are several of his works from this period. &quot;The Iron Age&quot; (1916) is set partly in Ludlow, Shropshire.

==Mercian novels==
The central project of Francis Brett Young&#x27;s career was a series of linked novels set in a loosely fictionalised version of the English West Midlands and Welsh Borders. The Mercian novels were originally inspired by the construction of Birmingham Corporation&#x27;s Elan Valley Reservoirs from 1893 to 1904, and the country traversed by their associated aqueduct. 

&quot;The Black Diamond&quot; (1921) tells the story of a labourer working on the aqueduct in the region around Knighton, while &quot;The House Under the Water&quot; (1932) deals at length with the construction of the reservoirs themselves. The series expanded into a wide-ranging study of Midlands society from the 1890s through to the outbreak of the Second World War. Although linked by recurring characters, each of the Mercian novels can be read as an independent work. They range in style from the atmospheric psychological horror of &quot;Cold Harbour&quot; (1924; praised by H. P. Lovecraft) to the romantic family saga of &quot;Portrait of Clare&quot; (1927), which won that year&#x27;s James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

Like Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex novels, the Mercian novels are unified by their setting—a semi-fictionalised realisation of an actual geographical region. While some actual place-names appear unchanged (e.g., Kidderminster, Ludlow, Malvern, Shrewsbury, Worcester), most locations appear under a fictional name (Birmingham = North Bromwich, Halesowen = Halesby; Dudley = Dulston; River Elan = River Garon). Other locations appear to be fictional conflations of various real-world places; e.g., the Black Country town of Wednesford; resembling in many respects the actual town of Wednesbury but located by the author in the Stour Valley (and seemingly unrelated to Hednesford, near Cannock), and the hamlet of Cold Harbour; modelled on Wassell Grove near Hagley but described by him as overlooking the Black Country.

<text>Chicoutimi ( , ) is the most populous borough (arrondissement) of the city of Saguenay in Quebec, Canada.

It is situated at the confluence of the Saguenay and Chicoutimi rivers. During the 20th century, it became the main administrative and commercial centre of the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region. In 2002 it merged into the new city of Saguenay and forms the heart of the 5th-largest urban area of the province of Quebec. At the 2021 census, its population was 69,004.

==History==

What was ultimately to become the centre of the borough of Chicoutimi was first settled by French colonists in 1676 as a trading post in the fur trade. At that time, the Saguenay and the Chicoutimi rivers had been used as waterways by the Montagnais tribes for centuries. The name &quot;Chicoutimi&quot; derives from the . After the British seized Lower Canada, the Chicoutimi trading post continued to operate only until 1782, as the fur trade had moved further west of the Great Lakes.

The city of Chicoutimi was officially incorporated in 1845 as a municipality by Peter McLeod, a Métis timber contractor who built a sawmill there in 1842. The town was designated in 1855 as the seat of Chicoutimi County and the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chicoutimi in 1878.

The arrival of the Canadian National Railway in 1893 stimulated the growth of Chicoutimi&#x27;s pulp and paper industries, particularly mechanical pulp production. The railway also built Chicoutimi station, which served the city until 1988. The Chicoutimi Pulp Co. was founded in 1896 backed by French-Canadian investors. The Chicoutimi Pulp Mill became the biggest producer of mechanical pulp in Canada by 1910.

Since the Great Depression, the city has become an administrative and commercial centre. New centres of education and culture were established: in 1967, the Conservatoire de musique de Saguenay; and in 1969, the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi. The city also played host to the Quebec Summer Games in 1972.

In the municipal amalgamations of 1976, Chicoutimi annexed the neighbouring towns of Chicoutimi-Nord and Rivière-du-Moulin. In a much larger round of Municipal reorganization in Quebec in 2002, the cities of Chicoutimi, Jonquière, La Baie, Lac-Kénogami, Laterrière, Shipshaw and part of Tremblay merged to form the new city of Saguenay. Chicoutimi became a borough of Saguenay.

During the summer of 1996, a record rainfall in the region caused major flooding in the downtown, as well as outlying areas. Dams were overrun, many bridges were destroyed throughout the region. The total cost of the disaster was recorded as 1.5 billion Canadian dollars. The flood also killed seven people.

Chicoutimi&#x27;s sister city is Camrose, Alberta.

==Geography and cityscape==
Chicoutimi is located in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region on the western end of the Saguenay Fjord; most of the borough, including the downtown section, is on the south shore of the Saguenay River. It is the geographical centre of the city of Saguenay; the Jonquière and La Baie boroughs adjoin on the west and east sides. Chicoutimi is about north of Quebec City and northwest upriver from Tadoussac, at the confluence of the St. Lawrence River. The former cities of Chicoutimi borough are Chicoutimi, Laterrière, Canton-Tremblay, Chicoutimi-Nord and Rivière-du-Moulin. They have maintained their names as wards in the amalgamated city.

The landscape of Chicoutimi consists of hills, valleys and plains, with the terrain becoming steeper near the Saguenay River. Its two major physical features are the Saguenay Graben, a rift valley of the Laurentian Highlands in which the city spreads, and the Saguenay Fjord, the glacier-carved steep shores of the Saguenay River. Mount Valin at is the tallest mountain of the region, and overlooks Chicoutimi north-east. The Chicoutimi, Du Moulin and Valin rivers all empty in the Saguenay river in Chicoutimi.

<doc id="184445" wikidata="Q3308069" url="?curid=184445" title="Vicar of Bray (term)">
<text>The Vicar of Bray is a satirical description of an individual fundamentally changing his principles to remain in ecclesiastical office as external requirements change around him. The religious upheavals in England from 1533 to 1559 (and then from 1633 to 1715) made it impossible for any devout clergyman to comply with all the successive requirements of the established church. The original figure was the vicar Simon Aleyn, although clerics who faced vicissitudes resulted in revised versions of the story.
A satirical 18th-century song, &quot;The Vicar of Bray&quot;, recounts the career of a vicar of Bray, Berkshire, towards the end of this period and his contortions of principle in order to retain his ecclesiastic office despite the changes through the course of several monarchs from Charles II to George I. A comic opera covers a later period in 18th-century history, while a film set in Bray, County Wicklow, in Ireland, covers Charles I, the English Civil War, the Commonwealth of England, The Protectorate, and restoration of Charles II.

&quot;The Vicar of Bray&quot; &quot;personif(ies) the archetypically Anglican knack for tasteful ambiguity that precludes the vulgar dialectic of yes or no. &quot;So, is it both/and or either/or, your Grace?&quot; &quot;Well, surely we must say it&#x27;s both, mustn&#x27;t we?&quot; It&#x27;s a talent developed to an art form in the Anglican tradition.&quot; 

==Historical basis==

The parish alluded to in most versions of the song is Bray, Berkshire, which at the time was almost wholly rural and agrarian. An early textual source for the legend of a long-standing, resilient and pliable incumbent of the parish of Bray was provided by Thomas Fuller (d. 1661) in his &quot;Worthies of England&quot;. Fuller&#x27;s account of the story runs as follows:

However, according to the facts of who held the benefice, the vicar alluded to by Fuller seems actually to have been two or more separate incumbents. Simon Symonds was vicar of Bray in 1522-51 during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI. Simon Aleyn was vicar in 1557–1565 under Mary I and Elizabeth I.

It seems that Bray&#x27;s Tudor clerics set a precedent, and the commonest version of the song today is based on events in the Stuart period. The incumbent during that period was Francis Carswell, vicar for 42 years, from 1667, who died in Bray in 1709. He was among very few clerics in England to minister to parishioners throughout such a long and fraught historical period, including the years after The Restoration and the Glorious Revolution.

Several other clerics inspired variants of the tradition and song, according to their location and date. They include:
*Andrew Perne (1519–89), sometime Dean of Ely whose initials were variously said to stand for &quot;A Papist&quot;, &quot;A Protestant&quot; and &quot;A Puritan&quot;, subject to the prevailing wind
*Thomas Barlow (1607–1691), Bishop of Lincoln
*Timothy Bray (1480–1539), Abbot of Heath, Derbyshire
*Edmund Waller (1606–1687), poet and politician.

==The song==

In the song &quot;The Vicar of Bray&quot;, the eponymous vicar was the clergyman of St Michael&#x27;s Church, Bray. The most familiar version of the lyrics recount his adaptability (some would say amorality) over half a century, from the reigns of Charles II to George I. Over this period, he embraced whichever form of liturgy, Protestant or Catholic, was favoured by the monarch of the day in order to retain his position as vicar of Bray.

==Comic opera==
&quot;The Vicar of Bray&quot; is an 1882 comic opera by Sydney Grundy and Edward Solomon. The opera is based on the character described in the 18th-century song, as well as on &quot;The History of Sandford and Merton&quot;, a series of 18th century moral tales.

==1937 film version==

A film version of the tale was released in 1937 starring Stanley Holloway as the vicar. In the film, the vicar (of Bray, County Wicklow, in Ireland) is given a more positive character and events are placed at a slightly earlier period, during the English Civil War. He successfully protects his parishioners by adopting a diplomatic approach during the turbulent events and secures forgiveness for moderate rebels from the restored Charles II.

==Cultural impact==
The Tower of Bray is also referred to in the song &quot;Parlour Songs&quot; in the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, although the song has been removed from more recent performances of that musical. 

George Orwell wrote an essay called &quot;A Good Word for the Vicar of Bray&quot;.

A scientific hypothesis is named after the Vicar of Bray that attempts to explain why sexual reproduction might be favoured over asexual reproduction.

&quot;Vicar of Bray&quot; is the name of the last-known surviving Whitehaven wooden-built ship. It was launched on 22 April 1841 by Robert Hardy.

<text>Seven ships of the Royal Navy have been named Warspite. The origins of the name are unclear, although it is probably from the word &quot;&quot; – an Elizabethan-era spelling variation of both &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; – in part embodying contempt for the Navy&#x27;s enemies, but which was also the common name for the green woodpecker, suggesting the &#x27;Warspight&#x27; would poke holes in enemy ships&#x27; (wooden) hulls. Until 1919 a woodpecker was used as the ships&#x27; crest; the official badge was a cannon, although the woodpecker continued to be used on the ships&#x27; tompions or gun muzzle plugs. &quot;Warspite&quot; carries the most battle honours of any ship in the Royal Navy, with the sixth &quot;Warspite&quot; being awarded fifteen of them.

* was a 29-gun galleon, originally known as &quot;Warspight&quot;. She was launched in 1596 and sold in 1649.
* was a 70-gun third-rate ship of the line launched in 1666. She was renamed in 1721, rebuilt three times and broken up in 1771.
* was a 74-gun third rate launched in 1758. She was on harbour service from 1778, was renamed in 1800 and was broken up in 1801.
* was a 76-gun third rate launched in 1807, razeed in 1840 and paid off in 1846. Lent to The Marine Society in 1862, she became a training ship until destroyed by fire in 1876.
* was an first-class armoured cruiser launched in 1884 and scrapped in 1905.
* was a launched in 1913. She served in the First World War and in numerous operations in the Second World War, earning the most battle honours of any Royal Navy ship. She ran aground on her way to be broken up in 1947 and was scrapped in 1950.
* was a nuclear-powered submarine launched in 1965 and decommissioned in 1991. She is currently awaiting disposal.
* HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; is the third planned ballistic missile submarine.

<text>The Housing Corporation was the non-departmental public body that funded new affordable housing and regulated housing associations in England. It was established by the Housing Act 1964. On 1 December 2008, its functions were transferred to two new organisations, the Homes and Communities Agency and the Tenant Services Authority. The Corporation was formally dissolved on 1 April 2009.

The last Chairman of the Housing Corporation was Peter Dixon, and his deputy was Shaukat Moledina.

==Successor bodies==
On 17 January 2007, Ruth Kelly announced proposals to bring together the investment functions of the Housing Corporation, English Partnerships and parts of the Department for Communities and Local Government to form a new unified housing and regeneration agency.

In the following months, Professor Martin Cave, Director of the Centre for Management under Regulation at University of Warwick, led the most comprehensive review of English housing regulation for 30 years. Reporting in June, the Cave Review recommended that a new regulatory agency be set up, separating the regulation and investment responsibilities of the Housing Corporation.

On 15 October 2007, Yvette Cooper announced that the Government accepted the recommendation of the Cave Review to transfer the Corporation&#x27;s regulatory powers to an independent body. Initially this was to be named the Office for Tenants and Social Landlords, but its name was subsequently changed to the Tenant Services Authority. The new investment body was initially announced as &quot;Communities England&quot;, later renamed as the Homes and Communities Agency.

The legislative framework for both new bodies is contained in the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, which gained royal assent on 22 July 2008. They became operational on 1 December 2008.

==Energy efficiency==

As the Corporation required the housing associations it funded to achieve EcoHomes standards, the Housing Corporation was indirectly responsible for building the greatest number of environmentally friendly homes in the UK. Eco-performance standards are to be raised further for grants provided in 2008–2010, when compliance exceeding Level 3 of the new Code for Sustainable Homes will be required.

<text>Circumlocution (also called circumduction, circumvolution, [[periphrasis]], [[kenning]], or ambage) is the use of an unnecessarily large number of words to express an idea. It is sometimes necessary in communication (for example, to work around lexical gaps that might otherwise lead to untranslatability), but it can also be undesirable (when an uncommon or easily misunderstood figure of speech is used). It can also come in the form of roundabout speech wherein many words are used to describe something that already has a common and concise term (for example, saying &quot;a tool used for cutting things such as paper and hair&quot; instead of &quot;scissors&quot;). Most dictionaries use circumlocution to define words. Circumlocution is often used by people with aphasia and people learning a new language, where simple terms can be paraphrased to aid learning or communication (for example, paraphrasing the word &quot;grandfather&quot; as &quot;the father of one&#x27;s father&quot;). Among other usages, circumlocution can be used to construct euphemisms, innuendos, and equivocations.

== Language acquisition ==
Circumlocution is often used by beginner and intermediate second language speakers to convey the meaning of a word they don&#x27;t know in their target language. Relative clauses are often used for circumlocution in English. For example,[Firefighters] are the people &quot;who&quot; you call when your house is on fire. A [spider] is an arachnid &quot;that&quot; catches insects in its web.Synonyms and simile are two other common circumlocution strategies. A pomegranate could be described using these techniques as follows:It&#x27;s a kind of fruit, it&#x27;s red and it has lots and lots of little seeds in it.

==Euphemisms==

&quot;Euphemistic language&quot; often uses circumlocution to avoid saying words that are taboo or considered offensive. For example, &quot;Holy mother of Jesus!&quot; is a circumlocution of &quot;Mary!&quot;, but &quot;heck&quot;, while still euphemistic, is not a circumlocution of &quot;hell&quot;.

Euphemistic circumlocution is also used to avoid saying &quot;unlucky words&quot;—words which are taboo for reasons connected with superstition: for example, calling the devil &quot;Old Nick&quot;, calling Macbeth &quot;the Scottish Play&quot; or saying &quot;baker&#x27;s dozen&quot; instead of thirteen.

==Innuendo==

&quot;Innuendo&quot; refers to something suggested but not explicitly stated.

==Equivocation==

&quot;Equivocation&quot; is the use of ambiguous language to avoid telling the truth or forming commitments.

<doc id="184453" wikidata="Q2002250" url="?curid=184453" title="Elizabeth de Clare">
<text>Elizabeth de Clare, 11th Lady of Clare (16 September 1295 – 4 November 1360) was the heiress to the lordships of Clare, Suffolk, in England and Usk in Wales. She was the youngest of the three daughters of Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford and Joan of Acre, and sister of Gilbert de Clare, who later succeeded as the 7th Earl. She is often referred to as Elizabeth de Burgh ( ), due to her first marriage to John de Burgh. Her two successive husbands were Theobald II de Verdun (of the Butler-de Verdun family) and Roger d&#x27;Amory.

==Marriages==
Elizabeth de Clare married three times. She had three children; one by each husband. Her father had been one of England&#x27;s wealthiest and most powerful nobles, and her mother was a daughter of King Edward I of England. When Elizabeth&#x27;s only brother Gilbert, 7th Earl of Hertford was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 aged only 23 and leaving no surviving issue, his property, estimated to be worth £6,000/year, was equally divided between his three full sisters, Elizabeth, Eleanor and Margaret. This made Elizabeth one of the greatest heiresses in England. 

===First marriage===
She accompanied her brother Gilbert to Ireland for their double wedding to two siblings: the son and daughter of the Earl of Ulster. Elizabeth married John de Burgh on 30 September 1308. He was the heir to the Earl of Ulster, and Elizabeth could expect to be a countess in due course. She gave birth to their only child, a son, in 1312; he would become William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster. Only a year later, her husband John was unexpectedly killed in a minor skirmish. A widow, Elizabeth remained in Ireland until the death of her brother, Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford and 8th Earl of Gloucester, at the Battle of Bannockburn compelled her immediate return to England in July 1314.

===Second marriage===

Edward II placed her in Bristol Castle, but his plans to marry her to one of his supporters were dashed in February 1316, when Elizabeth was abducted from Bristol by Theobald II de Verdun, the former Justiciar of Ireland. He claimed that he and Elizabeth had been engaged before she was called back to England. She was Lady Verdun for only six months until Theobald died on 27 July 1316, at Alton, Staffordshire, from typhoid. He left behind three daughters from prior marriages and Elizabeth, who was pregnant. She fled to Amesbury Priory, where she stayed under the protection of her aunt Mary de Burgh, who was a nun there. At Amesbury she gave birth to Theobald&#x27;s posthumous daughter, Isabel de Verdun (named for the Queen), who was born on 21 March 1317, and was baptised by the Bishop of Salisbury. The Verdun estates were partitioned among Theobald&#x27;s four daughters as coheiresses and their husbands, and were granted to Elizabeth&#x27;s third husband until the daughter came of age.

===Third marriage===

Just a few weeks later after Isabel&#x27;s birth, Edward II married Elizabeth to Sir Roger D&#x27;Amory, Lord D&#x27;Amory, Baron of Amory in Ireland. D&#x27;Amory had been a knight in her brother&#x27;s service who rose to prominence as a favourite of Edward II. Now married to him, Elizabeth was caught up in the political upheavals of her uncle&#x27;s reign and was still only about 21 years old. She gave birth to another daughter, Elizabeth D&#x27;Amory, in May 1318. Roger was reckless and violent, and made a deadly enemy of his brother-in-law, Hugh Despenser the younger. D&#x27;Amory switched sides, joining the Marcher Lords led by Roger Mortimer and Thomas, Earl of Lancaster in the rebellion known as the Despenser War. He died of his wounds at Tutbury Castle, Staffordshire after 16 March 1322, having been captured by the royalist forces at the Battle of Boroughbridge where the rebels were soundly defeated. Elizabeth was captured at Usk Castle and imprisoned at Barking Abbey with her children by the victorious faction.

==Loss and recovery of property==

Elizabeth&#x27;s brother-in-law, Hugh Despenser the younger, lord of Glamorgan, became a particular favourite of King Edward II. With the support of the king he began to take over the adjacent lordships in south Wales, with the aim to consolidate a huge landholding by fair means or foul. He concentrated on the lordships held by his sisters-in law and their husbands: Margaret and Hugh D&#x27;Audley (lordship of Gwynllwg or Newport), and Elizabeth and Roger Damory (lordship of Usk). Faced with this threat, the Marcher lords of south Wales, led by Damory, rose up against Despenser in May 1321 capturing his castles at Caerphilly and Cardiff. Their success contributed to the king&#x27;s banishment of Hugh and his father on 14 August that year. This success was only short-lived as the king recalled the Despensers in October 1321 and launched a counter-offensive against the Marcher lords and their allies. Elizabeth was taken prisoner at Usk Castle in January 1322, and imprisoned in Barking Abbey, London, with her husband dying two months later. Elizabeth was forced by the king to exchange her lordship of Usk with Despenser&#x27;s less-valuable lordship of Gower.

The rebellion of Queen Isabella of France and her lover Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, saw King Edward II and Hugh Despenser flee to south Wales in October 1326. By this date Elizabeth seems to have been back in residence at Usk Castle, and she regained this lordship after Despenser&#x27;s execution. She held a very elaborate Christmas feast that year in Usk Castle, perhaps partly in celebration of her adversary&#x27;s death, for which the long list of food and drink survives in the collection of the National Archives. She also undertook building works at Usk and the nearby Llangibby Castle, where she would entertain her friends, Marie de St Pol, countess of Pembroke, first amongst these. She stayed at Usk from October 1348 until April 1350, perhaps to escape the Black Death.

==Later life ==
After D&#x27;Amory&#x27;s death, Elizabeth de Clare never remarried and styled herself the &#x27;Lady of Clare&#x27; after her principal estate in Suffolk. She also had a residence at Anglesey Abbey, Cambridgeshire, Great Bardfield, Essex, and in 1352 she built a London house in the precinct of the Franciscan Convent of the Minoresses, Aldgate. A good idea of her lifestyle in the last 25 years of her life can be taken from the extensive survival of her household and other records. These throw light on the activities of and provision of food and drink for the household (numbering up to 100 people) of one of the richest and most influential women of the fourteenth century. Amongst the records are the works of her personal goldsmith in 1333.

Elizabeth was a religious benefactress and in her records she also lists alms giving and patronage towards her favourite religious houses, such as the priories at Clare, Anglesey, and Walsingham (founded on her manor), and Denny Abbey. Her most important and long-lasting foundation was Clare College, Cambridge. This began when she was asked to support University Hall, founded by Richard de Badew, in 1326. When Richard handed over his rights as patron to Elizabeth in 1346, she made further grants, including providing the college with statutes in 1359, and it became known as Clare Hall.

==Death==

Elizabeth de Burgh died on 4 November 1360 and was buried at the convent of the Minoresses following a funeral costing £200. Her tomb has not survived but must have been elaborate. Her will with its extensive bequests is published along with her household records. Her seals are held in the collections at the British Library. 

== Issue ==

* Elizabeth de Clare&#x27;s eldest daughter, Isabel de Verdun married Henry de Ferrers, 2nd Baron Ferrers of Groby. The marriage produced at least five children, four of whom survived infancy. 

* Her younger daughter, Elizabeth d&#x27;Amory, married John Bardolf, 3rd Lord Bardolf of Wormegay, Knight Banneret (1314–1363). They had three children.

* Her son William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster and 4th Baron of Connaught married Maud of Lancaster, the daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster and Maud Chaworth. His wardship had been granted to her father. By his wife, William had one daughter, Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster, who was her father&#x27;s sole heiress. She was betrothed to Edward III&#x27;s third but second surviving son Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, in 1341, and they married on 9 September 1342 at the Tower of London.

<text>The 1907 Isle of Man TT races were the inaugural International Tourist Trophy for motor-cycles held on the Isle of Man. The event was held on Tuesday 28 May 1907 over the St John&#x27;s Short Course consisting of a Single Cylinder and a Twin-Cylinder class. The race was ten laps of the 15 mile 1,430 yards course, a total race distance of 158 miles 220 yards (226.071 km).

At 10am on the Tuesday 28 May 1907, 25 riders started in pairs in a time-trial format for the road-legal touring motorcycles with exhaust silencers, saddles, pedals and mud-guards. On lap 1, Jack Marshall riding a Triumph suffered a fall and Frank Applebee Junior a puncture to his 5 hp Rex machine. By lap 2, Stanley Webb riding a 5 hp Triumph had to stop at St. Johns to adjust a drive-belt and retired on lap 3 with an engine exhaust-valve problem. At the compulsory 10‑minute replenishment stop, Oliver Godfrey had to retire when his 5 hp Rex motorcycle caught fire.

The Single Cylinder class race was won by Charles R. Collier riding a Matchless in 4 hours, 8 minutes and 8 seconds at an average race speed of 38.21 mph. His brother Harry Collier, also riding a Matchless, had problems with an engine seizure on lap 2 and eventually retired on lap 9.

The Twin-Cylinder class and overall race was initially led by Rem Fowler riding a Norton. On lap 1, Fowler completed the course in 23 minutes and 19 seconds, in second place was Billy Wells in a time of 23 minutes and 21 seconds and Charlie Collier in the single-cylinder class with a time of 23 minutes and 45 seconds. The overall lead fell away as Fowler suffered a number of problems with drive-belts and spark-plugs, and on lap 7 crashed at nearly 60 mph due to a burst tyre at the &quot;Devils Elbow&quot; on the Kirk Michael to Peel section of the course. Fowler nearly gave up, but was told by a spectator that he led the twin-cylinder class by 30 minutes from Billy Wells and went on to win at an average race speed of 36.22 mph and set the fastest lap of the race at 42.91 mph.

<doc id="184462" wikidata="Q92751" url="?curid=184462" title="David H. Bailey (mathematician)">
<text>David Harold Bailey (born 14 August 1948) is a mathematician and computer scientist. He received his B.S. in mathematics from Brigham Young University in 1972 and his Ph.D. in mathematics from Stanford University in 1976. He worked for 14 years as a computer scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, and then from 1998 to 2013 as a Senior Scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He is now retired from the Berkeley Lab.

Bailey is perhaps best known as a co-author (with Peter Borwein and Simon Plouffe) of a 1997 paper that presented a new formula for π (pi), which had been discovered by Plouffe in 1995. This Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula permits one to calculate binary or hexadecimal digits of pi beginning at an arbitrary position, by means of a simple algorithm. Subsequently, Bailey and Richard Crandall showed that the existence of this and similar formulas has implications for the long-standing question of &quot;normality&quot;—whether and why the digits of certain mathematical constants (including pi) appear &quot;random&quot; in a particular sense.

Bailey was a long-time collaborator with Jonathan Borwein (Peter&#x27;s brother). They co-authored five books and over 80 technical papers on experimental mathematics.

Bailey also does research in numerical analysis and parallel computing. He has published studies on the fast Fourier transform (FFT), high-precision arithmetic, and the PSLQ algorithm (used for integer relation detection). He is a co-author of the NAS Benchmarks, which are used to assess and analyze the performance of parallel scientific computers. A &quot;4-step&quot; method of calculating the FFT is widely known as Bailey&#x27;s FFT algorithm (Bailey himself credits it to W. M. Gentleman and G. Sande).

He has also published articles in the area of mathematical finance, including a 2014 paper &quot;Pseudo-mathematics and financial charlatanism,&quot; which emphasizes the dangers of statistical overfitting and other abuses of mathematics in the financial field.

In 1993, Bailey received the Sidney Fernbach award from the IEEE Computer Society, as well as the Chauvenet Prize and the Hasse Prize from the Mathematical Association of America. In 2008 he was a co-recipient of the Gordon Bell Prize from the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2017 he was a co-recipient of the Levi L. Conant Prize from the American Mathematical Society.

Bailey is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has positioned himself as an advocate of the teaching of science and that accepting the conclusions of modern science is not incompatible with a religious view.

<text>Fifi D&#x27;Orsay (born Marie-Rose Angelina Yvonne Lussier; April 16, 1904 – December 2, 1983) was a Canadian-American actress and singer.

==Early life==
Fifi D&#x27;Orsay was born Marie-Rose Angelina Yvonne Lussier in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to a father who was a postal clerk. The D&#x27;Orsays were a large family, with Fifi having 11 siblings. She was educated at the Academy of the Sacred Heart in Montreal before graduating and finding work as a secretary.

==Biography==
As a young stenographer, she wished to become an actress, and moved to New York City. Once there she found work with the Greenwich Village Follies, after an audition in which she sang &quot;Yes! We Have No Bananas&quot; in French. When asked where she was from, she told the director she was from Paris, France, and that she had worked in the Folies Bergère. The impressed director hired her, billing her as &quot;Mademoiselle Fifi&quot;.

While working in the Follies, she became involved with Ed Gallagher, a veteran actor who was half of the successful Broadway comedy team of Gallagher and Shean. Gallagher and D&#x27;Orsay put together a vaudeville act, and he coached her in the art of show business. After touring in vaudeville, she headed to Hollywood and adopted the surname &quot;D&#x27;Orsay&quot; (after a favorite perfume). Soon after she began working in films, often cast as the &quot;naughty French girl&quot; from &quot;gay Paris&quot;.

She became a U.S. citizen in 1936, just as her career as a film star came to a sharp halt when she walked out on her contract at Fox Studios and was blacklisted.

While never becoming a major top-billing name, she found steady work, and appeared with such stalwarts as Bing Crosby and Buster Crabbe. For years she worked in both film and vaudeville; pacing her appearances in film with continued performances in vaudeville. When age put an end to the glamour roles, she took jobs in television; including 2 appearances each on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot; (as a mother superior in the episode &quot;Castaways&quot;), and the CBS legal drama &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (in the episodes &quot;The Case of the Grumbling Grandfather&quot; and &quot;The Case of the Bountiful Beauty&quot;)—as well as appearing in the CBS sitcom &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;. She was a contestant on Groucho Marx&#x27;s &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; (February 23, 1956), and at the age of 67 she bookended her career with a return to the Broadway stage in the Tony Award-winning musical, &quot;Follies&quot;.

==Personal life==
D&#x27;Orsay married twice. Her first husband was Earl Hill (also billed as &quot;Maury Hill&quot; &amp; &quot;Morgan Hill&quot;), the son of a Chicago manufacturer. She divorced Hill in 1939 and married Peter LaRicos in 1947, a restaurateur and agent.

D&#x27;Orsay died from cancer, aged 79, on December 2, 1983, at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. She was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Legacy==
D&#x27;Orsay was credited as the girl who made the phrase &quot;Ooh La La&quot; widely known.

<doc id="184469" wikidata="Q2368238" url="?curid=184469" title="Florence La Badie">
<text>Florence La Badie (born Florence Russ; April 27, 1888 – October 13, 1917) was an American-Canadian actress in the early days of the silent film era. She was a major star between 1911 and 1917. Her career was at its height when she died at age 29 from injuries sustained in an automobile accident.

==Early life==
Florence La Badie was born Florence Russ on April 27, 1888, the second child of Horace Blancard and Marie Lynch (Chester) Russ in New York City. After the death of her father in 1890 and her mother&#x27;s inability to provide sufficient care, Florence, at age three, was adopted by Joseph E. and Amanda J. La Badie of Montreal, Canada. She was given their surname.

Florence&#x27;s adoptive father, Joseph E. La Badie, was a prominent attorney in Montreal. His wife, former Amanda Victor, is said to have been born in Europe, possibly Paris. Florence&#x27;s adoptive uncle, Oddiehon LaBadie, maintained an estate in nearby St. Lambert. Florence was educated in New York City schools and at the Convent of Notre Dame in Montreal.

==Actress==
Florence La Badie moved to New York after school and became one of the most important and popular actresses of the early motion picture era. Starting in 1909, she appeared in 30 films for Biograph, and 166 silent films from 1911 through 1917 for the Thanhouser studio in New Rochelle, New York.

A daredevil at heart, she was known as &quot;Fearless Flo&quot; for taking risks and performing many of her own stunts. She was a frequent subject for articles and letters in fan and trade magazines, and over a period of years, she was the most publicized and beloved of all Thanhouser players.

==Career success==

Having completed her studies, she was offered work as a fashion model in New York City. Once there, in early 1908 she obtained a small part in a stage play. Following this, she signed to tour with a road company for the next two years and appeared on stage in various places in the eastern part of the United States. During this period she met a fellow Canadian, the young actress Mary Pickford, who suggested she &quot;try pictures&quot;. In 1909 Pickford invited La Badie to watch the making of a motion picture at the Biograph studio in Manhattan. Given an impromptu bit part, La Badie was invited back to Biograph&#x27;s studios to participate in another film later that year. She would go on to make several films under the renowned D. W. Griffith, with her first credited film being in the 1909 film &quot;The Politician&#x27;s Love Story&quot;, starring Mack Sennett and Kathlyn Williams. 

In 1911, La Badie&#x27;s career took a leap forward when she was hired by Edwin Thanhouser of the Thanhouser Film Corporation in New Rochelle, New York. With her sophistication and beauty, Florence La Badie soon became Thanhouser&#x27;s most prominent actress, appearing in dozens of films over the next two years. Her most remembered films of that period were &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1911); &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1912), a film adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson story; and the first film of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot; (1914). Her most well-known work was in the 1914-1915 serial, &quot;The Million Dollar Mystery&quot;. In 1915, she was featured in the magazine &quot;Reel Life&quot;, which described her as &quot;the beautiful and talented Florence La Badie, of the Thanhouser Studios, considered one of the foremost of American screen players&quot;. Over a course of six years, La Badie&#x27;s career had taken her to top-billing as a film actress.

==World War I==
When World War I broke out in Europe in 1914, Canada immediately joined the war as an ally of the United Kingdom. Several of La Badie&#x27;s young male friends and relatives from Montreal were quickly shipped overseas. She had many movie fans in Canada and, according to one New York newspaper, in 1915 a young soldier fighting in the trenches at the Front in Northern France wrote to her, sending dozens of photographs that graphically depicted the horrors of the war.

Deeply affected, La Badie became a vigorous advocate for peace, traveling the United States with a stereopticon slide show of the soldier&#x27;s photographs, warning about the terrible dangers of going to war. 

==Personal life==
For a time, La Badie was engaged to a Cadillac salesman named Val Hush but they broke up. She later became involved with Daniel Carson Goodman, a writer who worked on the scenario for Thanhouser&#x27;s serial &quot;Zudora&quot;.

==Death==
In August 1917, La Badie was at the height of her motion picture success. She had appeared in 185 films since 1909, 32 fewer than Mary Pickford&#x27;s 217 films during the same period. Her film &quot;The Woman in White&quot; had just been released in July 1917.

Her most recent two films, &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot;, a film adaptation of Edward Everett Hale&#x27;s &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot;, and &quot;War and the Woman&quot;, were scheduled to be released, both on September 9, 1917.

Although the Thanhouser Corporation had been struggling since the 1914 death of Charles J. Hite in an automobile accident, La Badie&#x27;s career was thriving and had been their saving grace. Less than a month earlier, she had announced that she was leaving Thanhouser. She said that several other film corporations were willing to pick her up on contract immediately.

On August 28, 1917, while driving near Ossining, New York, in the company of her fiancé, Daniel Carson Goodman, La Badie found her brakes failed and the vehicle plunged down a hill, overturning at the bottom. She was thrown from the vehicle and suffered serious injuries, including a compound fracture of the pelvis, while Goodman escaped with only a broken leg. Hospitalized, she clung to life for more than six weeks and seemed to be improving, but suddenly died on October 13, from sepsis.

La Badie was the first major female film star to die while her career was at its peak, and the movie-going public mourned her death. After a large funeral, she was interred in an unmarked grave in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. In a deposition in a legal proceeding days before La Badie&#x27;s death, Marie C. Russ swore in a deposition to have been her biological mother. Obituary notices stated La Badie was survived by her mother, Amanda La Badie, with no mention of her having been adopted. The property of the pilot&#x27;s estate was divided between Mr. and Mrs. Joseph La Badie.

In 2014, Ned Thanhouser, the grandson of Edwin Thanhouser, raised money for a headstone for La Badie, which was installed on April 27 of that year, on what would have been her 126th birthday.

<doc id="184473" wikidata="Q446120" url="?curid=184473" title="Marie Prevost">
<text>Marie Prevost (born Mary Bickford Dunn; November 8, 1896 – January 21, 1937) was a Canadian film actress. During her 20-year career, she made 121 silent and sound films.

Prevost began her career during the silent film era. She was discovered by Mack Sennett who signed her to contract and made her one of his &quot;Bathing Beauties&quot; in the late 1910s. Prevost appeared in dozens of Sennett&#x27;s short comedy films before moving on to feature-length films for Universal. In 1922, she signed with Warner Bros. where her career flourished as a leading lady. She was a favorite of director Ernst Lubitsch who cast her in three of his comedy films: &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot; (1924), &quot;Three Women&quot; (1924) and &quot;Kiss Me Again&quot; (1925).

After being let go by Warner Bros in early 1926, Prevost&#x27;s career began to decline and she was relegated to secondary roles. She was also beset with personal problems, including the death of her mother in 1926 and the breakdown of her marriage to actor Kenneth Harlan in 1927, which fueled her depression. She began to abuse alcohol and binge eat, resulting in a weight gain that made it difficult for her to secure acting jobs. By 1935, Prevost was only able to secure bit parts in films. She made her last onscreen appearance in 1936.

After years of drinking, Prevost died of acute alcoholism at the age of 40 in January 1937. Prevost&#x27;s estate was valued at $300 since she had squandered most of her earnings. Her death prompted the Hollywood community to create the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital.

==Early life==
Prevost was born in Sarnia, Ontario, to Hughina Marion (née Bickford) and Arthur &quot;Teddy&quot; Dunn. Her father worked as a railway conductor. When she was an infant, Teddy Dunn was killed when gas seeped into the St. Clair Tunnel. Hughina later married Frank Prevost and the family moved to Denver. In 1900, Hughina gave birth to another daughter, Marjorie, called Peg. Marie&#x27;s stepfather, who worked as a miner and surveyor, frequently moved the family around the country following up on various get-rich-quick schemes. After living in Ogden, Utah; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, the family finally settled in Los Angeles. Hughina and Frank Prevost later divorced. Frank Prevost died in September 1933 and bequeathed Marie $1.

While living in Los Angeles, Prevost attended Manual Arts High School. By 1915, Prevost landed a job as a secretary at a law firm which represented the Keystone Film Company. While running an office errand at the Keystone Studios, Prevost was asked to appear in a bit part for the film &quot;His Father&#x27;s Footsteps&quot;. Mack Sennett, Keystone&#x27;s owner, was impressed by Prevost&#x27;s performance and sent word that he wanted to see Prevost in his office. Prevost later recalled the day to &quot;Motion Picture World&quot; magazine: &quot;I asked for Mr. Sennett and was ushered in right away. He looked very stern as I walked into his office. I was ready to cry. Suddenly, he smiled. &#x27;I want your signature today. Sign right here.&#x27; I suddenly realized the paper he pushed in front of me was a contract. I was to be one of his Sennett Bathing Beauties. Best of all I was to be paid $15 a week. I signed without reading a word. Fifteen dollars was a lot of money.&quot;

As her career was beginning to rise, Prevost married socialite Henry Charles &quot;Sonny&quot; Gerke in June 1918. The couple soon separated, and Prevost kept news of the marriage a secret.

==Career==

===Early years===
Initially cast in minor comedic roles as the sexy, innocent young girl, she worked in numerous films for Sennett&#x27;s studio. In 1919, Sennett cast Prevost in her first lead role in &quot;Yankee Doodle in Berlin&quot;. The film was a hit and helped to solidify Prevost&#x27;s career. She scored another success in the 1920 romantic film &quot;Love, Honor, and Behave&quot;, opposite George O&#x27;Hara, another newcomer and Sennett protégé. By 1921, Prevost wanted to move to another studio, later stating that she left Keystone because Sennett was only interested in making money and was unconcerned with creativity. Director King Baggot helped secure her a contract with Universal for $1,000 per week. Prevost was released from her contract with Keystone, and she signed with Universal in 1921.

At Universal, Irving Thalberg took an interest in Prevost and became determined to make her a star. Thalberg ensured that she received a great deal of publicity and staged numerous events which put her in the public spotlight. After announcing that he had selected two films in which Prevost would star, &quot;The Moonlight Follies&quot; (1921) and &quot;Kissed&quot; (1922), Thalberg sent Prevost to Coney Island where she burned her bathing suit to symbolize the end of her bathing beauty days.

===Stardom===
While at Universal, Prevost still was relegated to light comedies. After her contract expired, Jack L. Warner signed her to a two-year contract at $1,500 per week at Warner Bros. in 1922. During this time, Prevost was dating actor Kenneth Harlan. Jack Warner also had signed Harlan to a contract and cast the couple in the lead roles in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot;. To publicize the film, Warner announced that the couple would marry on the film&#x27;s set. The publicity stunt worked, and thousands of fans sent gifts and letters to the couple. In August 1923, Sonny Gerke, Prevost&#x27;s first husband filed for divorce. The &quot;Los Angeles Mirror&quot; got wind that Prevost still was married and ran a story with the headline &quot;Marie Prevost Will Be a Bigamist if She Marries Kenneth Harlan&quot;. Warner was livid over the negative publicity and Prevost&#x27;s failure to disclose her first marriage despite the fact that the publicity stunt was his idea.

In spite of the bad publicity, Prevost&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; brought good reviews. Director Ernst Lubitsch chose her for a major role opposite Adolphe Menjou in 1924&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage Circle&quot;. Of her performance as the beautiful seductress, Lubitsch said that she was one of the few actresses in Hollywood who knew how to underplay comedy to achieve the maximum effect. This performance, praised by &quot;The New York Times,&quot; resulted in Lubitsch casting her in &quot;Three Women&quot; in 1924 and in &quot;Kiss Me Again&quot; the following year.

In early 1926, Warner Bros. decided to not renew Prevost and Harlan&#x27;s contracts (the two quietly married in 1924 after Prevost&#x27;s divorce was finalized). Shortly after she was dismissed by Warner Bros., Prevost&#x27;s mother Hughina died in an automobile accident in Lordsburg, New Mexico, on February 5, 1926. Hughina had been traveling to Palm Beach, Florida, with actress Vera Steadman and Hollywood studio owner Al Christie when their vehicle overturned. Hughina was crushed by the vehicle and died at the scene. Steadman and Christie sustained serious injuries, but survived.

Actress Phyllis Haver, who had been friends with Prevost since her bathing beauty days, later stated in an interview that she believed the loss of Prevost&#x27;s and Harlan&#x27;s contracts with Warner Bros. caused problems in the marriage and was one of the causes of Prevost&#x27;s alcoholism.

===Decline===
Devastated by the loss of her only remaining parent, Prevost began drinking heavily and developed an addiction to alcohol. Prevost tried to get past her personal torment by burying herself in her work, starring in numerous roles as the temptingly beautiful seductress who in the end was always the honorable heroine. Adding to her depression was the end of her marriage to Kenneth Harlan – the two separated in 1927.

After seeing Prevost in &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot;, Howard Hughes cast her as the lead in &quot;The Racket&quot; (1928). Hughes and Prevost later had a brief affair. After the affair ended, Prevost was heartbroken which furthered her depression. Her role in &quot;The Racket&quot; proved to be Prevost&#x27;s last leading role.

Prevost&#x27;s depression caused her to binge on food resulting in significant weight gain. Her career continued but she was relegated to secondary roles. In 1929, Cecil B. DeMille offered her a co-starring role in his final silent film &quot;The Godless Girl&quot;, starring Lina Basquette. In her 1990 autobiography, Basquette recalled that Prevost was not outwardly bitter about losing her leading lady status, stating &quot;Aw, hell, that&#x27;s the way it is.&quot; Prevost received generally good reviews for her role in the film. The following year, she signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

While at MGM, Prevost worked steadily but was offered only secondary parts. In 1930, she appeared in &quot;Paid&quot;, starring Joan Crawford. While Prevost&#x27;s role was secondary, she garnered good reviews. In 1931, she played Academy Award winner Helen Hayes&#x27; loyal friend in &quot;The Sin of Madelon Claudet&quot;. In 1932, she was one of the three leads in the film &quot;Three Wise Girls&quot;, starring Jean Harlow. By 1934, she had no work at all, and her financial situation deteriorated dramatically. The downward spiral became aggravated when her weight problems forced her into repeated crash dieting to keep whatever bit part a movie studio offered. Prevost made her last on screen appearance in a bit part as a waitress in &quot;Ten Laps to Go&quot; (1936).

==Personal life==

Prevost was married twice with both marriages ending in divorce. Her first marriage was to socialite Henry Charles &quot;Sonny&quot; Gerke in June 1918. The marriage was not known to the public until Gerke filed for divorce in August 1923 citing desertion. Gerke claimed that the marriage was kept a secret because Prevost feared it would damage her budding acting career. News of the marriage was revealed shortly after Jack L. Warner devised a publicity stunt in which he claimed that Prevost and her &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; co-star Kenneth Harlan would marry on the film&#x27;s set in real life. To avoid negative publicity, Prevost did not fight the divorce. In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Prevost admitted that she and Gerke married on a whim and had separated shortly after marrying. She also stated that she and Gerke had remained friendly and dated on occasion. Gerke&#x27;s divorce petition was granted in October 1923.

In October 1924, Prevost married actor Kenneth Harlan. The two starred in several films together, including &quot;The Beautiful and the Damned&quot; and &quot;Bobbed Hair&quot;. Prevost and Harlan separated in May 1927, and Prevost filed for divorce. Later that year, she was granted an interlocutory divorce. However, the couple reconciled in June 1928. The reconciliation proved to be brief and their divorce was finalized in January 1929.

==Death==
Prevost died on January 21, 1937, at the age of 40, evidently from the combination of acute alcoholism and malnutrition stemming from anorexia nervosa. Her body was not discovered until January 23 after neighbors complained about her dog&#x27;s incessant barking. A houseboy found her body after entering her room. Police found several empty liquor bottles in the room along with a promissory note to Joan Crawford for $110.

Her funeral (which was paid for by Joan Crawford) at the Hollywood Memorial Cemetery was attended by Crawford, Clark Gable, Wallace Beery, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Mack Sennett, and Barbara Stanwyck. Prevost&#x27;s sister had her remains cremated and combined them with those of their mother, who had died in 1926.

In February 1937, it was discovered that Prevost&#x27;s estate was valued at $300. Prevost&#x27;s fate as well as that of others prompted the Hollywood community to create the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital to provide medical care for employees of the television and motion picture industry.

On February 8, 1960, Prevost was honored for her contribution to the motion picture industry with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6211 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Filmography==
==In popular culture==
* Prevost&#x27;s death was featured in the book &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; by Kenneth Anger. In the book, Anger claims Prevost&#x27;s dog consumed her remains over the ensuing days to survive. However, Anger&#x27;s claims that Prevost&#x27;s dog made &quot;mincemeat out of his mistress&quot; are false. While Prevost&#x27;s pet dachshund Maxie did bite her legs in an effort to wake her, the dog did not attempt to eat her body.
* Nick Lowe&#x27;s song &quot;Marie Provost&quot; (sic) from the 1978 album &quot;Jesus of Cool&quot; details her life and Anger&#x27;s account of her death. The song includes the lyric in the chorus &quot;She was a winner/that became the doggie&#x27;s dinner&quot;. The song references the date July 29, which is now known amongst Lowe&#x27;s fans as &#x27;Marie Prevost Day&#x27;.
* In 2019, novelist Laini Giles released &quot;Bathing Beauty,&quot; a novel that details Prevost&#x27;s life.

<text>Sunderland Association Football Club is a professional football club based in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England, which competes in the Championship, the second tier of English football. 

Formed in 1879, the club has won six top-flight titles (1892, 1893, 1895, 1902, 1913, and 1936) in the First Division, and finished runners-up five times. The club has also won the FA Cup twice (1937 and 1973), and been runners-up twice (1913 and 1992), and won the FA Charity Shield in 1936. They were also Football League Cup finalists in 1985 and 2014.

Nicknamed the Black Cats, Sunderland play home games at the 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light, having moved from Roker Park in 1997. The club has a long-standing rivalry with nearby Newcastle United, with whom the Tyne–Wear derby has been contested since 1898. They play in red and white-striped shirts and black shorts.

==History==


===Early years and the &quot;Team of All Talents&quot; (1879–1908)===
The club was founded as Sunderland and District Teachers A.F.C. by schoolmaster James Allan in what has commonly been believed to be October 1879. However, evidence suggests that the club was not formally created until a year later, on 25 September 1880. It was renamed as Sunderland A.F.C. and became open to more than just school teachers in October 1880.
Sunderland joined The Football League for the 1890–91 season. Tom Watson became Sunderland&#x27;s first manager when he was appointed in 1888. During the late 19th century, they were declared the &quot;Team of All Talents&quot; by William McGregor, the founder of the league, after a 7–2 win against Aston Villa. Sunderland won the league championship in the 1891–92 season, one season after joining The Football League, and this performance led &quot;The Times&quot; to describe the players as &quot;a wonderfully fine team&quot;. Sunderland successfully defended the title the following season, aided by their Scottish centre forward John Campbell, who broke the 30-goal mark for the second time in consecutive seasons. In the process, they became the first team to score 100 goals in a season, a feat not matched until 1919–20.

Sunderland came close to winning a third successive league championship in the 1893–94 season, finishing second behind Aston Villa. However, they regained the title in the 1894–95 season, with Campbell becoming league top scorer for the third time. Sunderland then beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian in a game described as the &quot;World Championship&quot; match. Their goalkeeper Ned Doig set a 19th-century world record by not conceding any goals in 87 of his 290 top division appearances (30%). From 1886 until 1898, Sunderland&#x27;s home ground was in Newcastle Road. In 1898, the club moved to what would become their home for almost a century, Roker Park. Initially the ground had a capacity of 30,000.

After taking Sunderland to three English League championship titles manager Watson resigned at the end of the 1895–96 season, in order to join Liverpool. Robert Campbell replaced him. Campbell did not achieve the same playing success as Watson, as Sunderland failed to win any titles in his three seasons at the club.

Scotsman Alex Mackie replaced Campbell as manager for the 1899 season. Following a second-place finish in 1900–01, the club won their fourth league title in the 1901–02 season, and followed this up with victory in the Sheriff of London Charity Shield.

In December 1902, Arthur Bridgett joined Sunderland. He went on to captain the &quot;Black Cats&quot; for ten years and gain eleven England caps, making him the club&#x27;s second most-capped England international behind Dave Watson.

===Further league championship titles (1908–1945)===

On 5 December 1908, Sunderland achieved their highest ever league win, 9–1 against north-east rivals Newcastle United. Under Irish manager Bob Kyle and with Scottish Charles Thomson as captain, the club won the league again in 1913, but lost their first FA Cup final 1–0 to Aston Villa.

Two seasons later the First World War brought the league to a halt. After the league&#x27;s resumption, Sunderland came close to winning another championship in the 1922–23 season, when they were runners-up to Liverpool. They also came close the following season, finishing third. The club escaped relegation from the First Division by one point in the 1927–28 season despite 35 goals from Dave Halliday. 
Halliday improved his goal scoring to 43 goals in 42 games the following season, an all-time Sunderland record for goals scored in a single season.

The club&#x27;s sixth league championship came in the 1935–36 season under Scottish manager Johnny Cochrane. They scored 109 goals during the season, with Raich Carter and Bobby Gurney each scoring 31. They followed this by winning the Charity Shield against FA Cup winners Arsenal.

Despite winning the league, the season did not go without tragedy. The young goalkeeper of the team, Jimmy Thorpe, died as a result of being kicked after he had picked up the ball following a backpass against Chelsea. He continued to take part until the match finished, but collapsed at home and died in hospital four days later. This incident led to a change in the rules, whereby players were no longer allowed to raise their foot to a goalkeeper when he had control of the ball in his arms.

They won the FA Cup the following season, after a 3–1 victory against Preston North End at Wembley Stadium. Some football was still played during the Second World War as a morale boosting exercise, in the form of the Football League War Cup. Sunderland were finalists in the tournament in 1942.

===&quot;The Bank of England&quot; club, financial troubles and three cup finals (1945–1995)===

For Sunderland, the immediate post-war years were characterised by significant spending; the club paid £18,000 (£ today) for Carlisle United&#x27;s Ivor Broadis in January 1949. Broadis was also Carlisle&#x27;s manager at the time, and this is the first instance of a player transferring himself to another club. This, along with record-breaking transfer fees to secure the services of Len Shackleton and the Welsh international Trevor Ford, led to a contemporary nickname, the &quot;Bank of England club&quot;. The club finished third in the First Division in 1950, their highest finish since the 1936 championship.

The late 1950s saw a sharp downturn in Sunderland&#x27;s fortunes, and the club was once again implicated in a major financial scandal in 1957. Found guilty of making payments to players in excess of the maximum wage, they were fined £5,000 (£ today), and their chairman and three directors were suspended. The following year, Sunderland were relegated from the highest division for the first time in their 68-year league history.
Sunderland&#x27;s absence from the top flight lasted six years. After a close call in the previous season, the club was promoted to Division One in 1964 after finishing in second place. At the end of the decade, they were again relegated to the Second Division after finishing 21st.
Sunderland won their last major trophy in 1973, in a 1–0 victory over Don Revie&#x27;s Leeds United in the FA Cup Final. A Second Division club at the time, Sunderland won the game thanks mostly to the efforts of their goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery. Ian Porterfield scored a volley in the 30th minute to beat Leeds and take the trophy. Since 1973 only two other clubs, Southampton in 1976, and West Ham United in 1980, have equalled Sunderland&#x27;s achievement of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football.

By winning the FA Cup, Sunderland qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, the club&#x27;s only appearance in European competition to date. They beat Vasas Budapest but then lost on aggregate to Sporting of Portugal in the second round. After spending six seasons in the Second Division, Sunderland were promoted to Division One in the 1975–76 season, but were relegated again the following season, despite a late-season comeback which saw them win two matches 6–0 and 6–1.

Sunderland appeared in their first League Cup final in 1985, but lost 1–0 to Norwich City. In 1987, Sunderland saw one of the lowest points in their history, when they were relegated to the Third Division of the English league for the first time. Under new chairman Bob Murray and new manager Denis Smith, the club was promoted the following season. In 1990, they were promoted back to the top flight in unusual circumstances, losing to Swindon Town in the play-off final, but Swindon&#x27;s promotion was revoked after the club was found guilty of financial irregularities and Sunderland were promoted instead. They stayed up for one year before being relegated on the final day of the following season.

Sunderland&#x27;s next outing in a major final came in 1992 when, as a Second Division club, they returned to the FA Cup final. There was to be no repeat of the heroics of 1973, as Sunderland lost 2–0 to Liverpool.

===New stadium, promotions and relegations (1995–2006)===
In 1995, they faced the prospect of a return to the third-tier of English football. Peter Reid was brought in as manager, and quickly turned things around. Reid&#x27;s time in charge had a stabilising effect; he remained manager for seven years. After promotion from Division One in the 1995–96 season, Sunderland began their first season in the Premier League, but finished third from the bottom and were relegated back to the First Division.

In 1997, Sunderland left Roker Park and moved to the Stadium of Light, a 42,000-seat arena that, at the time, was the largest stadium built in England after the Second World War. The capacity was later increased to 49,000.

Sunderland returned to the Premier League as First Division champions in 1999 with a then-record 105 points. At the end of the season Sunderland finished seventh, with Kevin Phillips winning the European Golden Shoe in his first top-flight season, scoring 30 goals.

Another seventh-place finish in the 2000–01 season was followed by two less successful seasons, and they were relegated to the second-tier with a then-record low 19 points in 2003. Former Ireland manager Mick McCarthy took over at the club, and, in 2005, he took Sunderland up as champions for the third time in less than 10 years. However, the club&#x27;s stay in the top flight was short-lived as Sunderland were once again relegated, this time with a new record-low total of 15 points. McCarthy left the club in mid-season, and he was replaced temporarily by former Sunderland player Kevin Ball.

===Drumaville Consortium takeover and Ellis Short era (2006–2016)===

Following Sunderland&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League, the club was taken over by the Irish Drumaville Consortium, headed by ex-player Niall Quinn, who appointed former Manchester United captain Roy Keane as the new manager. Under Keane, the club rose steadily up the table with an unbeaten run of 17 games to win promotion to the Premier League, Following an inconsistent start to the 2008–09 season, Keane resigned. Before the start of the following campaign, Irish-American businessman Ellis Short completed a full takeover of the club, and Steve Bruce was announced as the next manager on 3 June.

One of Bruce&#x27;s first signings, Darren Bent, cost a club record fee of £10 million, broken a year later when they bought Ghana international Asamoah Gyan for around £13 million. Sunderland started the 2010–11 season strongly, but after Bent left for Aston Villa in January 2011 in a deal potentially worth £24 million, a record transfer fee received for the club, they eventually finished 10th—which was still their highest top-flight finish for 10 years. After being named Sunderland&#x27;s Young Player of the Year for two seasons in a row, local player Jordan Henderson was transferred to Liverpool at the end of the 2010–11 season, where he went on to win the Champions League among other achievements.

Short replaced Quinn as chairman in October 2011, with Quinn initially becoming Director of International Development; he left the club with immediate effect in February 2012. Bruce was sacked in November 2011, and replaced by Martin O&#x27;Neill. O&#x27;Neill was sacked in March 2013 and Italian Paolo Di Canio was announced as his replacement the following day to widespread controversy. Sunderland went on to avoid relegation with one game to go. Di Canio was sacked after a poor start to the 2013–14 season, and reports of a complete breakdown in relations with his players. Gus Poyet was announced as his replacement, and led Sunderland to the 2014 Football League Cup Final, where they were defeated 3–1 by Manchester City. In March 2015 Poyet was sacked, and veteran Dutchman Dick Advocaat was appointed, saving the club from relegation. Eight games into the 2015–16 season he resigned from the position. Sam Allardyce was appointed the next manager in October 2015, and the club was again saved from relegation at the end of the season.

===Divisional movements and ownership changes (2016–present)===
In July 2016, Allardyce left the club to be announced as manager for the England national team, and David Moyes was appointed as his replacement. Under Moyes, Sunderland made the worst ever start to a Premier League season, taking just two points from their opening 10 matches. The club was relegated for the first time in 10 years at the end of 2016–17, finishing bottom of the table, and Moyes resigned. In June 2017, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, a product of Sunderland&#x27;s academy, was transferred to Everton for a fee of £25 million, rising to a possible £30 million—a record for a British goalkeeper.

Following relegation, Simon Grayson was announced as the new manager. The club made a very poor start to the 2017–18 EFL Championship season (which was documented in the Netflix series &quot;Sunderland &#x27;Til I Die&quot;) and Grayson was sacked at the end of October, with Chris Coleman replacing him. In April 2018, after a second consecutive relegation, this time to League One, the club was sold to Stewart Donald and Juan Sartori. Coleman was then released from his contract.

Jack Ross was appointed as the new manager in May 2018. In the club&#x27;s first season in League One they got to the final of the EFL Trophy and finished 5th and reached the play-off final, but lost to Charlton Athletic at Wembley. After a disappointing start to the following 2019–20 season, Ross was sacked. He was replaced by former Bolton Wanderers manager Phil Parkinson. Sunderland finished the season in 8th place, their lowest ever league position, with the final standings ultimately being determined by points per game due to football&#x27;s suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parkinson was sacked in November 2020 and was replaced by Lee Johnson the following month. Later that month, the club reached an agreement with Kyril Louis-Dreyfus for him to purchase a controlling stake in the club. The takeover was completed on 18 February 2021. In May 2021, the club again fell short of promotion after losing to Lincoln City 3–2 on aggregate in the semifinals of the play-offs.

In February 2022, former Norwich City manager Alex Neil was appointed as head coach, following Johnson&#x27;s dismissal after a 6–0 loss to Bolton in January. After finishing fifth in League One at the end of the season, Sunderland qualified for the playoffs. In the semi-finals, they beat Sheffield Wednesday 2–1 on aggregate, and went on to beat Wycombe Wanderers 2–0 in the final to secure a return to the second flight of English football for the first time in four years. Tony Mowbray took over as head coach in August that year following Neil&#x27;s departure to manage Stoke City. Sunderland ended the season in 6th, and were knocked out of the playoff semi-final by Luton Town. Mowbray was sacked in December 2023 and replaced by Michael Beale, who was himself sacked after 12 games, the shortest managerial stint in Sunderland&#x27;s history; interim manager Mike Dodds ended the 2023–24 season in 16th. French manager Régis Le Bris was announced as head coach in June 2024, joining from Lorient.

In 2023, Stewart Donald officially left Sunderland, when Juan Sartori bought the remainder of his shares. According to Sunderland, Louis-Dreyfus owns 64% of the club, while Sartori owns the remaining 36%.

==Colours and crest==

Sunderland played in an all blue strip from their formation until 1884, when they adopted a red and white halved strip. They assumed the current strip of red and white stripes in the 1887–88 season. Their badge included a ship, the upper part of the Sunderland coat of arms, a black cat, and a football in front of Sunderland&#x27;s red and white stripes. In 1972 the badge was changed, removing the black cat but still including a ship, a football and the background of red and white stripes. This badge was first used on the match day shirt in 1977, replacing the simple black &#x27;SAFC&#x27; initials which had been used since 1973. The top section and border of the badge was coloured in blue until 1991, when it changed to black.

To coincide with the move from Roker Park to the Stadium of Light in 1997, Sunderland released a new crest divided into four quarters; the upper right and lower left featured their traditional red and white colours, but the ship was omitted. The upper left section features the Penshaw Monument and the lower right section shows the Wearmouth Bridge. A colliery wheel at the top of the crest commemorates County Durham&#x27;s mining history, and the land the Stadium of Light was built on, formerly the Monkwearmouth Colliery. The crest also contains two lions, the black cats of Sunderland, and a banner displaying the club&#x27;s motto, &quot;Consectatio Excellentiae&quot;, which means &quot;In pursuit of excellence&quot;.

==Stadium==

Sunderland have had eight grounds throughout their history; the first was at Blue House Field in Hendon in 1879. The ground was close to the place where Sunderland formed, at Hendon Board School; at that time the rent for use of the ground was £10 (£ today). The club then used a number of fields, one of which was near The Cedars road, before relocating to Groves Field in Ashbrooke in 1882 for one season. The club&#x27;s third stadium was Horatio Street in Roker, the first Sunderland stadium north of the River Wear; the club played a single season there before another move, this time to Abbs Field in Fulwell for two seasons. Abbs Field was notable for being the first Sunderland ground to which they charged admission.

Sunderland moved to Newcastle Road in 1886. By 1898, the ground reached a capacity of 15,000 after renovations, and its rent had risen to £100 (£ today) a year. Near the turn of the 20th century, Sunderland needed a bigger stadium. They returned to Roker and set up home in Roker Park. It was opened on 10 September 1898, and the home team played a match the same day against Liverpool, which they won. The stadium&#x27;s capacity increased to 50,000 after redevelopment with architect Archibald Leitch in 1913. Sunderland were nearly bankrupted by the cost of renovating the Main Stand, and Roker Park was put up for sale but no further action was taken. On 8 March 1933, an overcrowded Roker Park recorded the highest ever attendance at a Sunderland match, 75,118 against Derby County in a FA Cup sixth round replay. Roker Park suffered a bombing in 1943, in which one corner of the stadium was destroyed. A special constable was killed while patrolling the stadium. By the 1990s, the stadium was no longer large enough, and had no room for possible expansion. In January 1990, the Taylor Report was released after overcrowding at Hillsborough Stadium resulted in the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans. The report recommended that all major stadiums must be converted to an all-seater design. As a result, Roker Park&#x27;s capacity was reduced. It was demolished in 1997 and a housing estate built in its place.

In 1997, Sunderland moved to their present ground, Stadium of Light in Monkwearmouth, which was opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Built with an original capacity of 42,000, it hosted its first game against Dutch team Ajax. The stadium bears a similar name to the Portuguese club Benfica&#x27;s ground Estádio da Luz, albeit in a different language. A stadium expansion in 2000 saw the capacity increase to 49,000. A Davy lamp monument stands outside the stadium, and a miners banner was presented to the club by the Durham Miners&#x27; Association, as a reminder of the Monkwearmouth Colliery pit the stadium was built on.

==Supporters and rivalries==
===Attendance and following===
The club has had a historically large and passionate following, with the club seeing attendance figures larger than other more fashionable clubs. For instance a 2019 by the International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) showed that over the prior 5 seasons (2013 to 2018) Sunderland recorded the 38th highest average attendance in world football with an average of 39,249 fans at the Stadium of Light. Sunderland&#x27;s average attendance were higher over that period than perennial title challengers such as Juventus FC in Italy and FC Porto in Portugal. Despite relegation from the Premier League in 2017 the club has continued to post large annual average attendance figures, recording over 30,000 for the 2019 and 2020 seasons, enough for 16th in the country. Following relegation from the Championship at the end of the 2017–18 season, Sunderland subsequently broke the League One division attendance record on 26 December 2018 in a match against Bradford City with a total of 46,039 fans.

===Popular songs, music and chants===
A song Sunderland fans sing every game before kickoff and has been described as the anthem of the club is a rendition of &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot; by Elvis Presley, with &quot;Sunderland&quot; being sung repeatedly after &quot;but I can&#x27;t help falling in love with you.&quot; &quot;Dance of the Knights&quot; from Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s ballet &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is traditionally played before the teams take the field; the club&#x27;s walk-on song is &quot;Ready to Go&quot; by Republica, with the crowd typically singing its chorus. Also, during Gus Poyet&#x27;s tenure, Sunderland supporters started singing &quot;Things Can Only Get Better&quot; by D:Ream. The fans launched a campaign to get the song back into the charts, to coincide with their team&#x27;s 2014 League Cup Final. A day after the Final, the song re-entered the UK Dance Chart at number 19.

Two of the most famous chants by Sunderland supporters are &quot;I&#x27;m Sunderland till I die&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re by far the greatest team, the world has ever seen&quot;—with the former being chosen as the title of the Netflix show &quot;Sunderland &#x27;Til I Die&quot;. One of the oldest Sunderland chants is &quot;Ha&#x27;way the lads&quot; which was sung at Sunderland games as far back as the 1960s.

According to a YouGov poll in 2014, supporters of Sunderland showed a tendency towards left politics. They sometimes sing a version of &quot;The Red Flag&quot; during games.

Ain&#x27;t No Stopping Us Now, was SAFC&#x27;s official release when the club reached the 1992 FA Cup Final against Liverpool. The song featured the first team squad and was released on A Love Supreme Records. 

Cheer Up Peter Reid was released by fans in 1996 after the terrace chant about the manager became popular. It sold 40,000 copies and peaked at 41 in the UK charts, and was number one in the NME Indie Charts. The proceeds of Cheer Up Peter Reid were donated to cancer charities. Another chant became a recording when A Love Supreme released Niall Quinn&#x27;s Disco Pants in 1999. It reached number one in the NME Indie Charts.

===Fanzines and fan produced material===
The fanzine &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; was first published in 1989 and has won nine awards for Fanzine of the Year. A Love Supreme has its base opposite the Stadium of Light, where its staff design the magazine, update their website, social media and create and sell their own range of fan related merchandise and provide coach travel for SAFC fans to every away game. Since 2010 the online fanzine &quot;Roker Report&quot; has operated on the SB Nation blogging network. Roker Report has since grown in popularity amongst Sunderland fans, producing daily articles and interaction with fans. In 2016 Roker Report started a podcast called RokerRapport which has three or four episodes weekly. They occasionally interview current and former footballers, managers, owners and prominent fans of Sunderland. Since 2013 an independent podcast called Wise Men Say was created and was initially one episode weekly; however, it has since grown in popularity and now does three episodes weekly. In 2021 we began publishing opinion pieces on wisemensay.co.uk with a team of writers producing a wide range of features and informative articles. And, in 2021, the Wise Men Say Podcast was nominated Club Podcast of the Year at the 2021 Football Supporters Association Awards. In 2022, Wise Men Say reached 2million downloads through its host platform Acast. The club also previously had an official monthly subscription magazine, called the &quot;Legion of Light&quot;, which season ticket holders received for no cost. Others in the past have been &quot;It&#x27;s The Hope I Can&#x27;t Stand&quot;, &quot;Sex and Chocolate&quot;, &quot;Wise Men Say&quot;, and &quot;The Roker Roar&quot; (later &quot;The Wearside Roar&quot;).

===Supporters clubs and officially recognised organisations===
According to the club there are over 70 branches of official Supporters&#x27; Clubs in England and around the world, including North Korea. The Official clubs are represented collectively by a Branch Liaison Council that was formed in the 1970s. In addition the club has had a SAFC Liaison Group (SLG) since 1994 that works with fans on club issues and an independent supporters group, the Red &amp; White Army (RAWA).

===Rivalries and close ties===

Traditionally, Sunderland&#x27;s two main rivals have been Newcastle United and Middlesbrough, against whom the Tyne–Wear derby and Tees–Wear derby are competed for respectively. Although both are generally geographically close, Newcastle are considered their main rivals. The club were rivals with fellow Sunderland-based team Sunderland Albion in the 1880s and 1890s, a breakaway club formed by Sunderland&#x27;s founder James Allan, until the club was made defunct. A more recent rivalry is with Coventry City, sparked by a controversial match in 1977 which, combined with results elsewhere, relegated Sunderland from the First Division but kept Coventry up.

Sunderland also share good relations and a mutual friendship with Dutch club Feyenoord; this was developed after Wearside shipbuilders found jobs in Rotterdam during the 1970s and 80s. The club also has good relations and a mutual friendship with Norwich City, with matches between the two clubs being known as the &quot;Friendship Trophy,&quot; following good rapport in the 1985 Milk Cup final.

==Charitable associations==

In 2001, the chairman Bob Murray established the Foundation of Light charity, to help educational development through football, and offers learning centres in addition to scholarships. The organisation engaged 280 children within a year, and three years after foundation opened a £1.6m facility along with double-decker buses redeveloped as classrooms.

==In popular culture==
Sunderland were the subject, together with Aston Villa, of one of the earliest football paintings in the world when in 1895 the artist Thomas M. M. Hemy painted a picture of a game between the teams at Sunderland&#x27;s then ground Newcastle Road.

In 1973, comedian Bobby Knoxall recorded &quot;Sunderland All the Way&quot; for the 1973 FA Cup Final record.

In 1996, a group of Sunderland fans under the name Simply Red and White released a song called &quot;Daydream Believer (Cheer Up Peter Reid)&quot; to the melody of &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; dedicated to the manager Peter Reid. The song peaked at number 41 in the UK Singles &amp; Album Chart. The fans recorded the song due to the fact the manager often had a dour demeanour, whilst the team was doing well, and even won promotion at the end of the season.

Sunderland were mentioned in the May 1997 State Opening of Parliament when Chris Mullin, MP for Sunderland South, stated in his seconding of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Gracious Speech:
Sunderland has been through hard times in the past, and has survived; as before, we will pick ourselves up, dust ourselves down and come out fighting. Sunderland looks to the future, not the past, and we shall soon be back in the Premier League.

In 1998 and following the demolition of Roker Park, playwright Tom Kelly and actor Paul Dunn created a one-man play called &quot;I Left My Heart at Roker Park&quot; about a fan struggling with the move and what Roker Park meant for him – the play originally ran in 1997, and has had a few revivals since.

In 1998, the BBC broadcast a six-part documentary named &quot;Premier Passions&quot;. It chronicled Sunderland&#x27;s 1996–97 season, in which the club was relegated from the Premier League, the year after winning promotion from the Football League First Division, and the move to Stadium of Light.

In 2018, Netflix released an eight-part documentary called Sunderland &#x27;Til I Die. It documented the events around Sunderland&#x27;s 2017–18 season which saw them relegated from the EFL Championship. As a result of the success of the first series, a second season was confirmed, despite opposition from many club members. The opposition was mostly to do with players fearing the series would cause their failures being associated with them for the rest of their careers.

==Nicknames==
Sunderland&#x27;s official nickname is &quot;The Black Cats&quot;. The name was made official in a public vote in 2000. Despite the nickname being made official only relatively recently, the black cat has been used as an emblem of the club throughout most of its history. Photographs exist of players holding a black cat which made Roker Park its home in the 1900s and 1910s, and which was fed and watered by the football club. The club&#x27;s first official badge featured a black cat sitting prominently in its centre and since the 1960s the emblem of the Sunderland A.F.C. Supporters Association has been a black cat. A Sunderland supporter, Billy Morris, took a black cat in his chest pocket as a good luck charm to the 1937 FA Cup final in which Sunderland brought home the trophy for the first time and reference has also been made to a &quot;Black Cat Battery&quot;, an Artillery battery based on the River Wear during the Napoleonic Wars.

Before this when the team still played at Roker Park, they were known as the Rokerites. This was made obsolete after the club left Roker Park for the Stadium of Light in 1997. Other nicknames used by the media and include the Mackems (believed to be related to the ship building industry and a name for inhabitants of Sunderland) or the Wearsiders, as a reference to the river that the city and broader region of Wearside sits alongside, and in contrast to their Tyneside rivals Newcastle United.

As well as club nicknames, names have been used to define memorable periods in the club&#x27;s history. The &quot;Team of All Talents&quot; moniker was used during Sunderland&#x27;s successful period in the 1890s, and Sunderland were known as the &quot;Bank of England club&quot; during the 1950s. This was in reference to the club&#x27;s spending in the transfer market at the time, which saw the transfer-record broken twice.

==Statistics and records==

The holder of the record for the most league appearances is Jimmy Montgomery, having made 527 first team appearances between 1961 and 1976. The club&#x27;s top league goal scorer is Charlie Buchan, who scored 209 goals from 1911 to 1925; Bobby Gurney is the record goalscorer over all competitions with 228 goals between 1926 and 1939. Dave Halliday holds the record for the most goals scored in a season: 43 in the 1928–29 season in the First Division. As of October 2014 John O&#x27;Shea is the most capped player for the club, making 100 appearances for the Republic of Ireland.

The club&#x27;s widest margin of victory in the league was in the 9–1 win against Newcastle United in the First Division in 1908. Sunderland&#x27;s biggest ever win in the FA Cup was an 11–1 victory against Fairfield in 1895. Their heaviest defeats in the league were 8–0 against Sheffield Wednesday in 1911, West Ham United in 1968, Watford in 1982 and Southampton in 2014 Sunderland joined the top division in England, The Football League, in the 1890–91 season and were not relegated until 1957–58 (a span of 67 years, although only 56 seasons of competitive football were played due to the suspension of league football between 1915–1919 and 1939–1946 due to the First and Second World Wars). In October 2015, Sunderland defeated rivals Newcastle United for the sixth consecutive time, a new record.

Sunderland&#x27;s record home attendance is 75,200, set during a sixth round FA Cup replay against Derby County on 8 March 1933.

==Kit sponsorship==

The first sponsor to appear on Sunderland kits was Cowie&#x27;s, the business group of then chairman Tom Cowie, between 1983 and 1985. The club was sponsored by the Vaux Breweries between 1985 and 1999, with drink brands such as Lambtons sometimes appearing on kits. Subsequently, the club were sponsored by Sunderland car dealership company Reg Vardy from 1999 to 2007. Sunderland were sponsored by the Irish bookmaker Boylesports, who signed a four-year contract with the club in 2007 estimated to be worth £8 million. In April 2010, Sunderland signed a two-year shirt sponsorship deal with tombola, a local online bingo company. On 25 June 2012, Sunderland announced the strengthening of their partnership with the Invest in Africa initiative, with the initiative becoming the club&#x27;s shirt sponsor for two years. The project is closely linked with Tullow Oil. However, after a year the club announced a new sponsorship deal with South African company Bidvest. On 1 June 2015 Sunderland announced a new sponsorship with Dafabet to appear on the kits for the following season.

The first kit manufacturer to appear on Sunderland kits was Umbro, between 1975 and 1981. French brand Le Coq Sportif produced kits between 1981 and 1983. Nike&#x27;s first stint as kit manufacturer came between 1983 and 1986, before kits from Patrick (1986–88), Hummel (1988–94), Avec (1994–97) and Asics (1997–00). Nike returned between 2000 and 2004. Diadora produced kits for a solitary season, 2004–05, and Lonsdale made kits between 2005 and 2007. Umbro returned for five seasons between 2007 and 2012, before Adidas became the club&#x27;s kit manufacturer for the first time in 2012. Nike then returned for a third time as Sunderland&#x27;s kit manufacturer in 2020.

<text>Braunau am Inn (; ) is a town in Upper Austria on the border with Germany. It is known for being the birthplace of Adolf Hitler.

==Geography==

The town is on the lower river Inn below its confluence with the Salzach, where it forms the border with the German state of Bavaria, halfway on the road between the state capital Linz and the Bavarian capital Munich, about north of Salzburg. Braunau is connected by bridges over the Inn with its Bavarian counterpart Simbach am Inn. A traditional port of entry, all border controls have been abolished since the implementation of the Schengen Agreement by Austria in 1997.

The town gave its name to the administrative district (&quot;&quot;). The population of Braunau am Inn was 16,182 in 2011.

==History==

While the abbey of Ranshofen was already mentioned in the course of the deposition of Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria, in 788, Braunau itself first appeared as &quot;Prounaw&quot; in an 1120 deed. The Innviertel region then was part of the Duchy of Bavaria.

Braunau received town rights in 1260, one of the first in present-day Austria. It became a fortress town and important trading route junction, dealing with the salt trade and with ship traffic on the Inn. As a major Bavarian settlement, the town played an outstanding role in the Bavarian uprising against the Austrian occupation during the War of the Spanish Succession, when it hosted the Braunau Parliament, a provisional Bavarian Parliament in 1705 headed by Georg Sebastian Plinganser (born 16 April 1680 in Pfarrkirchen; died 7 May 1738 in Augsburg).

The Late Gothic Braunau parish church dedicated to Saint Stephen was built from 1439 to 1466, replacing an older chapel. Its high spire is one of the tallest in Austria and the town&#x27;s landmark. The remains of the fortress today house a museum and parts of the former town walls can still be seen. Another museum is housed in refurbished 18th-century public baths.

Within 40 years, Braunau changed hands three times: In 1779, it became an Austrian town under the terms of the Treaty of Teschen, which settled the War of the Bavarian Succession. During War of the Third Coalition, the Nuremberg bookseller Johann Philipp Palm was arrested at the Braunau fortress by French troops and executed for high treason by personal order of Napoleon in 1806. Under the terms of the 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn, Braunau became Bavarian again in 1809. In 1816, during reorganisation of Europe after the Napoleonic Wars at the Congress of Vienna, the Kingdom of Bavaria ceded the town to the Austrian Empire and was compensated by the gain of Aschaffenburg. Braunau has been Austrian ever since.

Braunau remained a garrison town of the Austro-Hungarian Army and became the site of a large prisoner of war camp in World War I. After the Nazi &#x27; to Nazi Germany in 1938, Ranshofen, which at that time had one of Austria&#x27;s largest aluminium plants, was incorporated into Braunau. Since 1992, the annual Braunau Contemporary History Days initiated by Andreas Maislinger concentrate on accounting for the past; the town&#x27;s administration awards the Egon Ranshofen-Wertheimer Award, named after native diplomat Egon Ranshofen-Wertheimer, to honour committed Austrians abroad. Several &#x27; were installed in Braunau by the artist Gunter Demnig.

===Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birthplace===

Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn where his father Alois Hitler served as a customs official since 1875. He and his family left Braunau and moved to Passau in 1892. Hitler was born in an apartment building recorded at Salzburger Vorstadt 15 in an 1890 register, which housed a craft brewery and several rental flats, one of them occupied by Alois Hitler, his third wife Klara, their son Adolf, and his elder half-siblings Alois Jr. and Angela.

In April 1934, the Passau &#x27; published a commemorative article, marking the room where Hitler was born. In April 1938, Braunau renamed to &#x27;, and its town plaza to &quot;&quot;, but the building itself remained a , with a sign advertising beer on tap.

That same year, Hitler&#x27;s personal secretary Martin Bormann purchased the house on behalf of the Nazi Party, it then became a cult centre containing an art gallery and a public library.

At the end of World War II in 1945, American soldiers occupied the house and prevented Nazi supporters from blowing it up. It was then used to temporarily house a documentary exhibition on Nazi concentration camps. In 1952, it was repurchased by its former owners, the Pommer family, and thereafter was used as a city library, a technical college and lastly a day-care centre for disabled people (&quot;Lebenhilfe&quot;).

Since World War II, the house had been controversial for both the local village and the Austrian government. In 1972 the Austrian Ministry of the Interior took over the main lease on the building to further discourage any notion of making it a pilgrimage site, and thereafter paid its owner approximately 4,800 euros in monthly rental.

In the process of coming to terms with the history of Austria in the time of National Socialism, the mayor of Braunau, Gerhard Skiba, presided over the installation of the Hitler birthplace memorial stone in front of the building. The installation took place in April 1989, two weeks before Hitler&#x27;s centenary. The stone, commemorating the victims of World War II, is made of granite from the quarry at the Mauthausen concentration camp. It states, &quot;&quot; (&quot;For peace, freedom and democracy; never again fascism: millions of dead remind us&quot;). The memorial also serves as a disincentive to &quot;Hitler tourism&quot;.

In 2011, the &quot;Lebenhilfe&quot; moved out and the Ministry requested permission to renovate the property. But Gerlinde Pommer, the then current owner, refused and she also refused the offer by the Ministry to purchase the house. The house has remained vacant since then.

In 2011, the Braunau town council voted to revoke any honorary citizenship that may have been conferred on Hitler in 1933. The action was described as &quot;precautionary&quot;, as no archival evidence could be found to confirm that he had received it in the first place.

In 2016, the Ministry pressed for the expropriation of the house by the government. This required a special law in the Austrian parliament. At the same time, an Austrian governmental commission was considering a number of options for the future of the house, turning it into apartments again, using it for a center or a museum that would confront Austria&#x27;s Nazi past, and even its demolition, replacing the original building with an entirely new structure.

On 18 October 2016, Austrian interior minister Wolfgang Sobotka said the building would instead be changed to the extent that it &quot;will not be recognizable.&quot; The contract was awarded to the architectural firm Marte Marte Architekten. The house was to be restored to its 1790 configuration with a double-gable roof, the removal of all of the 1938 Nazi additions, and a whitewash of the front.

In June 2020, it was announced that, after the restoration, the house would serve as a police station. Restoring the house was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and costs considerably increased. In 2023 it was announced that, in addition to the police station, the house would be used as a training center. The restoration is expected to be completed in 2025, with the police station and district police headquarters able to move in in 2026.

<text>Samuel Alfred De Grasse (June 12, 1875 – November 29, 1953) was a Canadian actor. He was the uncle of cinematographer Robert De Grasse.

==Biography==
Samuel Alfred De Grasse was born in Bathurst, New Brunswick to Lange De Grasse and Helene ( Comeau), both of French-Canadian descent. He trained to be a dentist, and married Annie McDonnell in 1904. Their daughter, Clementine Bell, was born in 1906. Annie died in 1909 while giving birth to another daughter, Olive, who also died. In 1910, Samuel was practicing dentistry and he and his daughter Clementine were living in Providence, Rhode Island along with his older sister, Mrs. Clementine Fauchy, and her 14-year-old son, Jerome Fauchy.

He married British actress Ada Fuller Golden and became a step-father to her three children. His own elder brother, Joe, went into the fledgling movie business and Sam decided to also give it a try. He traveled to New York City and, in 1912, he appeared in his first motion picture. At first he played standard secondary characters such as Dr. Robert Armstrong in &quot;Blind Husbands&quot; (1919), but when fellow Canadian Mary Pickford set up her own studio with her husband Douglas Fairbanks, he joined them. He portrayed the villainous Prince John in Douglas Fairbanks&#x27; 1922 &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. Afterward, he began to specialize in crafty or slimy villainous roles, such as Senator Charles Summer in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), the mill owner Arthur Jenkins in &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916), John Carver in &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot; (1923), Colonel Lestron in &quot;The Eagle of the Sea&quot; (1926), a pirate lieutenant in &quot;The Black Pirate&quot; (1926), a Pharisee in &quot;The King of Kings&quot; (1927) and King James in &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; (1928). Mary Pickford named him as one of her favorite stars. 

In the 1960s, Jackie Coogan claimed Jean Harlow had lived in De Grasse&#x27;s apartment for two years and was married to him when she was 16. At the time both de Grasse and Harlow were deceased. The claim was untrue -- Harlow was married to Charles McGrew when she was 16. However, she did appear as an extra in the film &quot;Honor Bound&quot; (1928), in which De Grasse played &quot;Blood Keller&quot;.

==Death==
De Grasse lived on the west coast until his death at age 78 in Hollywood from a heart attack during his sleep. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<text>Joseph Louis De Grasse (May 4, 1873 – May 25, 1940) was a Canadian film director. Born in Bathurst, New Brunswick, he was the elder brother of actor Sam De Grasse.

==Biography==
Joseph De Grasse had studied and was a first-class graduate of accounting and he began his career as a journalist, but soon became enamored with the theater and took work as a stage actor. In 1903, he quit his full-time job as the City of Boston&#x27;s bookkeeper to pursue acting. In 1910, he acted in his first motion picture and although he would appear as an actor in 13 films, and write 2 screenplays, his real interest was in directing.

While working in Hollywood for Universal Pictures, De Grasse met and married one of the few female directors working at the time, Ida May Park (1879–1954). In 1915, he became a founding member of the Motion Picture Directors Association, a forerunner to today&#x27;s Directors Guild of America.

During his career he directed a total of 86 films. In 1924, actor Lon Chaney said of the De Grasses:
Joe and Sam De Grasses are two of the most talented personalities in today&#x27;s film industry. Joe, a very skilled actor, is also the consummate director, firm in his demands yet gentle in his way of dealing with many different temperaments to be found in the movie industry. Sam is the only actor I know who can horrify an audience without make-up and without grotesque posturing and playing to the camera. He is the only actor I know who pulls teeth on the set in between takes. A rare pair, they have given the industry not one but two dimensions.

Joseph De Grasse died in Eagle Rock, California; he collapsed on a street while walking, and was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. The cause of his death was a heart attack.

<text>Berton Churchill (December 9, 1876 – October 10, 1940) was a Canadian stage and film actor.

==Early years==
Churchill was born in Toronto, Ontario. After his family moved to New York City, he graduated from high school there, studied law at night, and was a weekly participant in the William J. Florence Dramatic Society in Jersey City. 
As a young man interested in the theater, he appeared in stock companies as early as 1903 and worked as a newspaper pressman, eventually becoming a foreman and leader of his union. Progressing in his acting, he began performing with the Berkely Lyceum.

== Career ==
Churchill acted for two years with a traveling repertory company, developing skills that eventually took him to Broadway. The death of his father caused him to return home to work as a press foreman. Eventually he returned to acting in small parts. His career received a boost when E. F. Albee saw him perform in Boston. Albee added him to his summer stock company at Pawtucket, where Churchill continued to perform almost every summer for at least two decades.

His first performance on Broadway was in &quot;The Barber of New Orleans&quot; (1909), and his last was in &quot;Five Star Final&quot; (1930). 

He was one of the earliest members of Actors Equity and sat on the union&#x27;s Council. In 1919, he was in charge of the New York headquarters during the Equity strike.

Around 1929, Churchill began to perform in motion pictures. Following the use of sound in film, he moved to Hollywood, California. There, he landed numerous supporting roles, usually as the stern or pompous character with such roles as a banker, a state governor, or a land baron. He was much in demand, &quot;establishing what was believed to be a record by appearing in 34 in 1932 alone.&quot; In more than 125 films, Churchill worked for some of the great directors such as Otto Preminger, John Ford, and Frank Capra. As well, he performed with many of the most famous stars of the day, such as Bette Davis (&quot;The Cabin in the Cotton&quot;), Jeanette MacDonald, Tyrone Power, Edward G. Robinson, and Will Rogers. Churchill is perhaps best known for his role as Gatewood, the absconding banker in John Ford&#x27;s highly acclaimed 1939 film &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, starring John Wayne.

In 1925, Churchill helped found the Masquers club that led to him and five other actors creating the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.

== Death ==
Churchill died in Medical Arts Center Hospital in New York City, of uremic poisoning. His body was returned to the west coast to be interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

<text>Intentionality is the mental ability to refer to or represent something. Sometimes regarded as the &quot;mark of the mental&quot;, it is found in mental states like perceptions, beliefs or desires. For example, the perception of a tree has intentionality because it represents a tree to the perceiver. A central issue for theories of intentionality has been the problem of &quot;intentional inexistence&quot;: to determine the ontological status of the entities which are the objects of intentional states.

An early theory of intentionality is associated with Anselm of Canterbury&#x27;s ontological argument for the existence of God, and with his tenets distinguishing between objects that exist in the understanding and objects that exist in reality. The idea fell out of discussion with the end of the medieval scholastic period, but in recent times was resurrected by empirical psychologist Franz Brentano and later adopted by contemporary phenomenological philosopher Edmund Husserl. Today, intentionality is a live concern among philosophers of mind and language. A common dispute is between naturalism, the view that intentional properties are reducible to natural properties as studied by the natural sciences, and the phenomenal intentionality theory, the view that intentionality is grounded in consciousness.

== Overview ==
The concept of intentionality was reintroduced in 19th-century contemporary philosophy by Franz Brentano (a German philosopher and psychologist who is generally regarded as the founder of act psychology, also called intentionalism) in his work &quot;Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint&quot; (1874). Brentano described intentionality as a characteristic of all acts of consciousness that are thus &quot;psychical&quot; or &quot;mental&quot; phenomena, by which they may be set apart from &quot;physical&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; phenomena.
Brentano coined the expression &quot;intentional inexistence&quot; to indicate the peculiar ontological status of the contents of mental phenomena. According to some interpreters the &quot;in-&quot; of &quot;in-existence&quot; is to be read as locative, i.e. as indicating that &quot;an intended object ... exists in or has &quot;in-existence&quot;, existing not externally but in the psychological state&quot; (Jacquette 2004, p. 102), while others are more cautious, stating: &quot;It is not clear whether in 1874 this ... was intended to carry any ontological commitment&quot; (Chrudzimski and Smith 2004, p. 205).

A major problem within discourse on intentionality is that participants often fail to make explicit whether or not they use the term to imply concepts such as agency or desire, i.e. whether it involves teleology. Dennett (see below) explicitly invokes teleological concepts in the &quot;intentional stance&quot;. However, most philosophers use &quot;intentionality&quot; to mean something with no teleological import. Thus, a thought of a chair can be about a chair without any implication of an intention or even a belief relating to the chair. For philosophers of language, what is meant by intentionality is largely an issue of how symbols can have meaning. This lack of clarity may underpin some of the differences of view indicated below.

To bear out further the diversity of sentiment evoked from the notion of intentionality, Husserl followed on Brentano, and gave the concept of intentionality more widespread attention, both in continental and analytic philosophy. In contrast to Brentano&#x27;s view, French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre (&quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;) identified intentionality with consciousness, stating that the two were indistinguishable. German philosopher Martin Heidegger (&quot;Being and Time&quot;), defined intentionality as &quot;care&quot; (&quot;Sorge&quot;), a sentient condition where an individual&#x27;s existence, facticity, and being in the world identifies their ontological significance, in contrast to that which is merely ontic (&quot;thinghood&quot;).

Other 20th-century philosophers such as Gilbert Ryle and A. J. Ayer were critical of Husserl&#x27;s concept of intentionality and his many layers of consciousness. Ryle insisted that perceiving is not a process, and Ayer that describing one&#x27;s knowledge is not to describe mental processes. The effect of these positions is that consciousness is so fully intentional that the mental act has been emptied of all content, and that the idea of pure consciousness is that it is nothing. (Sartre also referred to &quot;consciousness&quot; as &quot;nothing&quot;).

Platonist Roderick Chisholm has revived the Brentano thesis through linguistic analysis, distinguishing two parts to Brentano&#x27;s concept, the ontological aspect and the psychological aspect. Chisholm&#x27;s writings have attempted to summarize the suitable and unsuitable criteria of the concept since the Scholastics, arriving at a criterion of intentionality identified by the two aspects of Brentano&#x27;s thesis and defined by the logical properties that distinguish language describing psychological phenomena from language describing non-psychological phenomena. Chisholm&#x27;s criteria for the intentional use of sentences are: existence independence, truth-value indifference, and referential opacity.

In current artificial intelligence and philosophy of mind, intentionality is sometimes linked with questions of semantic inference, with both skeptical and supportive adherents. John Searle argued for this position with the Chinese room thought experiment, according to which no syntactic operations that occurred in a computer would provide it with semantic content. Others are more skeptical of the human ability to make such an assertion, arguing that the kind of intentionality that emerges from self-organizing networks of automata will always be undecidable because it will never be possible to make our subjective introspective experience of intentionality and decision making coincide with our objective observation of the behavior of a self-organizing machine.

==The problem of intentional inexistence==
A central issue for theories of intentionality has been &quot;the problem of intentional inexistence&quot;: to determine the ontological status of the entities which are the objects of intentional states. This is particularly relevant for cases involving objects that have no existence outside the mind, as in the case of mere fantasies or hallucinations.

For example, assume that Mary is thinking about Superman. On the one hand, it seems that this thought is intentional: Mary is &quot;thinking about something&quot;. On the other hand, Superman &quot;does not exist&quot;. This suggests that Mary either is &quot;not thinking about something&quot; or is &quot;thinking about something that does not exist&quot; (that Superman fiction exists is beside the point). Various theories have been proposed in order to reconcile these conflicting intuitions. These theories can roughly be divided into &quot;eliminativism&quot;, &quot;relationalism&quot;, and &quot;adverbialism&quot;. Eliminativists deny that this kind of problematic mental state is possible. Relationalists try to solve the problem by interpreting intentional states as relations while Adverbialists interpret them as properties.

===Eliminativism===
&quot;Eliminativists&quot; deny that the example above is possible. It might seem to us and to Mary that she is thinking about something but she is not really thinking at all. Such a position could be motivated by a form of semantic externalism, the view that the meaning of a term, or in this example the content of a thought, is determined by factors external to the subject. If meaning depends on successful reference then failing to refer would result in a lack of meaning. The difficulty for such a position is to explain why it seems to Mary that she is thinking about something and how seeming to think is different from actual thinking.

===Relationalism===
&quot;Relationalists&quot; hold that having an intentional state involves standing in a relation to the intentional object. This is the most natural position for non-problematic cases. So if Mary perceives a tree, we might say that a perceptual relation holds between Mary, the subject of this relation, and the tree, the object of this relation. Relations are usually assumed to be existence-entailing: the instance of a relation entails the existence of its relata. This principle rules out that we can bear relations to non-existing entities. One way to solve the problem is to deny this principle and argue for a kind of &quot;intentionality exceptionalism&quot;: that intentionality is different from all other relations in the sense that this principle does not apply to it.

A more common relationalist solution is to look for existing objects that can play the role that the non-existing object was supposed to play. Such objects are sometimes called &quot;proxies&quot;, &quot;traces&quot;, or &quot;ersatz objects&quot;. It has been suggested that abstract objects or Platonic forms can play this role. Abstract objects have actual existence but they exist outside space and time. So when Mary thinks about Superman, she is standing in a thinking relation to the abstract object or the Platonic form that corresponds to Superman. A similar solution replaces abstract objects with concrete mental objects. In this case, there exists a mental object corresponding to Superman in Mary&#x27;s mind. As Mary starts to think about Superman, she enters into a relationship with this mental object. One problem for both of these theories is that they seem to mischaracterize the experience of thinking. As Mary is thinking about Superman, she is neither thinking about a Platonic form outside space-time nor about a mental object. Instead, she &quot;is&quot; thinking about a concrete physical being. A related solution sees possible objects as intentional objects. This involves a commitment to modal realism, for example in the form of the Lewisian model or as envisioned by Takashi Yagisawa.

===Adverbialism===
&quot;Adverbialists&quot; hold that intentional states are properties of subjects. So no independent objects are needed besides the subject, which is how adverbialists avoid the problem of non-existence. This approach has been termed &quot;adverbialism&quot; since the object of the intentional state is seen as a modification of this state, which can be linguistically expressed through adverbs. Instead of saying that &quot;Mary is thinking about Superman&quot;, it would be more precise, according to adverbialists, to say that &quot;Mary is thinking in a superman-ly manner&quot; or that &quot;Mary is thinking superman-ly&quot;. Adverbialism has been challenged on the grounds that it puts a strain on natural language and the metaphysical insights encoded in it. Another objection is that, by treating intentional objects as mere modifications of intentional states, adverbialism loses the power to distinguish between different complex intentional contents, the so-called many-property-problem.
== Dennett&#x27;s taxonomy of current theories about intentionality ==
Daniel Dennett offers a taxonomy of the current theories about intentionality in Chapter 10 of his book &quot;The Intentional Stance&quot;. Most, if not all, current theories on intentionality accept Brentano&#x27;s thesis of the irreducibility of intentional idiom. From this thesis the following positions emerge:
* intentional idiom is problematic for science;
* intentional idiom is not problematic for science, which is divided into:
** Eliminative materialism;
** Epistemological realism;
** Quinean double standard (see below) which is divided into:
*** adherence to Normative Principle (epistemology), which is divided into:
**** who makes an Assumption of Rationality;
**** who follows the Principle of Charity;
*** adherence to Projective Principle.

Roderick Chisholm (1956), G.E.M. Anscombe (1957), Peter Geach (1957), and Charles Taylor (1964) all adhere to the former position, namely that intentional idiom is problematic and cannot be integrated with the natural sciences. Members of this category also maintain realism in regard to intentional objects, which may imply some kind of dualism (though this is debatable).

The latter position, which maintains the unity of intentionality with the natural sciences, is further divided into three standpoints:
* &quot;Eliminative materialism&quot;, supported by W.V. Quine (1960) and Churchland (1981)
* &quot;Realism&quot;, advocated by Jerry Fodor (1975), as well as Burge, Dretske, Kripke, and the early Hilary Putnam
* those who adhere to the &quot;Quinean double standard&quot;.

Proponents of the &quot;eliminative materialism&quot;, understand intentional idiom, such as &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;desire&quot;, and the like, to be replaceable either with behavioristic language (e.g. Quine) or with the language of neuroscience (e.g. Churchland).

Holders of &quot;realism&quot; argue that there is a deeper fact of the matter to both translation and belief attribution. In other words, manuals for translating one language into another cannot be set up in different yet behaviorally identical ways and ontologically there are intentional objects. Famously, Fodor has attempted to ground such realist claims about intentionality in a language of thought. Dennett comments on this issue, Fodor &quot;attempt[s] to make these irreducible realities acceptable to the physical sciences by grounding them (somehow) in the &#x27;syntax&#x27; of a system of physically realized mental representations&quot; (Dennett 1987, 345).

Those who adhere to the so-called &quot;Quinean double standard&quot; (namely that &quot;ontologically there is nothing intentional, but that the language of intentionality is indispensable&quot;), accept Quine&#x27;s thesis of the indeterminacy of radical translation and its implications, while the other positions so far mentioned do not. As Quine puts it, indeterminacy of radical translation is the thesis that &quot;manuals for translating one language into another can be set up in divergent ways, all compatible with the totality of speech dispositions, yet incompatible with one another&quot; (Quine 1960, 27). Quine (1960) and Wilfrid Sellars (1958) both comment on this intermediary position. One such implication would be that there is, in principle, no deeper fact of the matter that could settle two interpretative strategies on what belief to attribute to a physical system. In other words, the behavior (including speech dispositions) of any physical system, in theory, could be interpreted by two different predictive strategies and both would be equally warranted in their belief attribution. This category can be seen to be a medial position between the realists and the eliminativists since it attempts to blend attributes of both into a theory of intentionality. Dennett, for example, argues in &quot;True Believers&quot; (1981) that intentional idiom (or &quot;folk psychology&quot;) is a predictive strategy and if such a strategy successfully and voluminously predicts the actions of a physical system, then that physical system can be said to have those beliefs attributed to it. Dennett calls this predictive strategy the intentional stance.

They are further divided into two theses:
* adherence to the &quot;Normative Principle&quot;
* adherence to the &quot;Projective Principle&quot;

Advocates of the former, the Normative Principle, argue that attributions of intentional idioms to physical systems should be the propositional attitudes that the physical system ought to have in those circumstances (Dennett 1987, 342). However, exponents of this view are still further divided into those who make an &quot;Assumption of Rationality&quot; and those who adhere to the &quot;Principle of Charity&quot;. Dennett (1969, 1971, 1975), Cherniak (1981, 1986), and the more recent work of Putnam (1983) recommend the Assumption of Rationality, which unsurprisingly assumes that the physical system in question is rational. Donald Davidson (1967, 1973, 1974, 1985) and Lewis (1974) defend the Principle of Charity.

The latter is advocated by Grandy (1973) and Stich (1980, 1981, 1983, 1984), who maintain that attributions of intentional idioms to any physical system (e.g. humans, artifacts, non-human animals, etc.) should be the propositional attitude (e.g. &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;desire&quot;, etc.) that one would suppose one would have in the same circumstances (Dennett 1987, 343).

== Basic intentionality types according to Le Morvan ==
Working on the intentionality of vision, belief, and knowledge, Pierre Le Morvan (2005) has distinguished between three basic kinds of intentionality that he dubs &quot;transparent&quot;, &quot;translucent&quot;, and &quot;opaque&quot; respectively. The threefold distinction may be explained as follows. Let&#x27;s call the &quot;intendum&quot; what an intentional state is about, and the &quot;intender&quot; the subject who is in the intentional state. An intentional state is transparent if it satisfies the following two conditions: (i) it is genuinely relational in that it entails the existence of not just the intender but the intendum as well, and (ii) substitutivity of identicals applies to the intendum (i.e. if the intentional state is about a, and a = b, then the intentional state is about b as well). An intentional state is translucent if it satisfies (i) but not (ii). An intentional state is opaque if it satisfies neither (i) nor (ii).

==Intentionalism==
Intentionalism is the thesis that all mental states are intentional, i.e. that they are about something: about their intentional object. This thesis has also been referred to as &quot;representationalism&quot;. Intentionalism is entailed by Brentano&#x27;s claim that intentionality is &quot;the mark of the mental&quot;: if all and only mental states are intentional then it is surely the case that all mental states are intentional.

Discussions of intentionalism often focus on the intentionality of conscious states. One can distinguish in such states their phenomenal features, or what it is like for a subject to have such a state, from their intentional features, or what they are about. These two features seem to be closely related to each other, which is why intentionalists have proposed various theories in order to capture the exact form of this relatedness.

===Forms of intentionalism===
These theories can roughly be divided into three categories: pure intentionalism, impure intentionalism, and qualia theories. Both pure and impure intentionalism hold that there is a supervenience relation between phenomenal features and intentional features, for example, that two intentional states cannot differ regarding their phenomenal features without differing at the same time in their intentional features. Qualia theories, on the other hand, assert that among the phenomenal features of a mental state there are at least some non-intentional phenomenal properties, so-called &quot;Qualia&quot;, which are not determined by intentional features. Pure and impure intentionalism disagree with each other concerning which intentional features are responsible for determining the phenomenal features. Pure intentionalists hold that only intentional content is responsible, while impure intentionalists assert that the manner or mode how this content is presented also plays a role.

Tim Crane, himself an impure intentionalist, explains this difference by distinguishing three aspects of intentional states: the intentional object, the intentional content, and the intentional mode. For example, seeing that an apple is round and tasting that this apple is sweet both have the same intentional object: the apple. But they involve different contents: the visual perception ascribes the property of roundness to the apple while the gustatory perception ascribes the property of sweetness to the apple. Touching the apple will also result in a perceptual experience ascribing roundness to the apple, but the roundness is presented in a different manner. So the visual perception and the haptic perception agree in both intentional object and intentional content but differ in intentional mode. Pure intentionalists may not agree with this distinction. They may argue, for example, that the difference in the last case also belongs to intentional content, because two different properties are ascribed to the apple: seen-roundness and felt-roundness.

===Mental states without intentionality ===
Critics of intentionalism, so-called anti-intentionalists, have proposed various apparent counterexamples to intentionalism: states that are considered mental but lack intentionality.

Some anti-intentionalist theories, such as that of Ned Block, are based on the argument that phenomenal conscious experience or qualia is also a vital component of consciousness, and that it is not intentional. (The latter claim is itself disputed by Michael Tye.)

Another form of anti-intentionalism associated with John Searle regards phenomenality itself, not intentionality, as the &quot;mark of the mental&quot; and thereby sidelines intentionality, since such anti-intentionalists &quot;might accept the thesis that intentionality coincides with the mental, but they hold the view that intentionality derives from consciousness&quot;.

A further form argues that some unusual states of consciousness are non-intentional, although an individual might live a lifetime without experiencing them. Robert K.C. Forman argues that some of the unusual states of consciousness typical of mystical experience are &quot;pure consciousness events&quot; in which awareness exists, but has no object, is not awareness &quot;of&quot; anything.

== Phenomenal intentionality ==

&quot;Phenomenal intentionality&quot; is the type of intentionality grounded in phenomenal or conscious mental states. It contrasts with &quot;non-phenomenal intentionality&quot;, which is often ascribed to e.g. language and unconscious states. The distinction is important to philosophers who hold that phenomenal intentionality has a privileged status over non-phenomenal intentionality. This position is known as the &quot;phenomenal intentionality theory&quot;. This privileged status can take two forms. In the moderate version, phenomenal intentionality is privileged because other types of intentionality depend on it or are grounded in it. They are therefore not intrinsically intentional. The stronger version goes further and denies that there are other types of intentionality. &quot;Phenomenal intentionality theory&quot; is commonly contrasted with naturalism about intentionality, the view that intentional properties are reducible to natural properties as studied by the natural sciences.

== Intentionality and self-consciousness ==
Several authors have attempted to construct philosophical models describing how intentionality relates to the human capacity to be self-conscious. Cedric Evans contributed greatly to the discussion with his &quot;The Subject of Self-Consciousness&quot; in 1970. He centered his model on the idea that executive attention need not be propositional in form.

<doc id="184485" wikidata="Q182682" url="?curid=184485" title="Sadducees">
<text>The Sadducees (; ) were a sect of Jews active in Judea during the Second Temple period, from the second century BCE to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. The Sadducees are described in contemporary literary sources in contrast to the two other major sects at the time, the Pharisees and the Essenes.

Josephus, writing at the end of the 1st century CE, associates the sect with the upper echelons of Judean society. As a whole, they fulfilled various political, social, and religious roles, including maintaining the Temple in Jerusalem. The group became extinct sometime after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE.

== Etymology ==
The English term entered via Latin from . The name Zadok is related to the root , (to be right, just), which could be indicative of their aristocratic status in society in the initial period of their existence.

==History==
According to Abraham Geiger, the Sadducee sect of Judaism derived their name from that of Zadok, the first High Priest of Israel to serve in Solomon&#x27;s Temple. The leaders of the sect were proposed as the Kohanim (priests, the &quot;Sons of Zadok&quot;, descendants of Eleazar, son of Aaron). The aggadic work Avot of Rabbi Natan tells the story of the two disciples of Antigonus of Sokho (3rd century BCE), Zadok and Boethus. Antigonus having taught the maxim, &quot;Be not like the servants who serve their masters for the sake of the wages, but be rather like those who serve without thought of receiving wages&quot;, his students repeated this maxim to their students. Eventually, either the two teachers or their pupils understood this to express the belief that there was neither an afterlife nor a resurrection of the dead, and founded the Sadducee and Boethusian sects. They lived luxuriously, using silver and golden vessels, because (as they claimed) the Pharisees led a hard life on earth and yet would have nothing to show for it in the world to come. The two sects of the Sadducees and Boethusians are thus, in all later Rabbinic sources, always mentioned together, not only as being similar, but as originating at the same time. The use of gold and silver vessels perhaps argues against a priestly association for these groups, as priests at the time would typically use stone vessels, to prevent transmission of impurity.

Josephus mentioned in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; that &quot;one Judas, a Gaulonite, of a city whose name was Gamala, who taking with him Sadduc, a Pharisee, became zealous to draw them to a revolt&quot;. Paul L. Maier suggests that the sect drew their name from the Sadduc mentioned by Josephus.

=== The Second Temple period ===
The Second Temple period is the period between the construction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 516 BCE and its destruction by the Romans during the Siege of Jerusalem. Throughout the Second Temple period, Jerusalem saw several shifts in rule. In Achaemenid Judea, the Temple in Jerusalem became the center of worship in Judea. Its priests and attendants appear to have been powerful and influential in secular matters as well, a trend that would continue into the Hellenistic period.

This power and influence also brought accusations of corruption. Alexander&#x27;s conquest of the Mediterranean world brought an end to Achaemenid control of Jerusalem (539–334/333 BCE) and ushered in the Hellenistic period, which saw the spread of Greek language, culture, and philosophical ideas, which intermixed with Judaism and created Hellenistic Judaism.

After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, his generals divided the empire amongst themselves, and for the next 30 years they fought for control of the empire. Judea was first controlled by Ptolemaic Egypt () and later by the Seleucid Empire of Syria (). During this period, the High Priest of Israel was generally appointed with the direct approval of the Greek rulership, continuing the intermixing of religious politics with government. King Antiochus IV Epiphanes of the Seleucids began a persecution of traditional Jewish practices around 168–167 BCE, which set off a rebellion in Judea. The most successful rebels were led by the Hasmonean family in what became the Maccabean Revolt, and eventually established the independent Hasmonean kingdom around 142 BCE. While the Sadducees are not attested to this early, many scholars presume that the later sects began to form during the Maccabean era (see Jewish sectarianism below). It is often speculated that the Sadducees grew out of the Judean religious elite in the early Hasmonean period, under rulers such as John Hyrcanus.

Hasmonean rule lasted until 63 BCE, when the Roman general Pompey conquered Jerusalem, at which point the Roman period of Judea began. The province of Roman Judea was created in 6 CE (see also Syria Palaestina). While cooperation between the Romans and the Jews had been strongest during the reigns of Herod and his grandson, Agrippa I, the Romans moved power out of the hands of vassal kings and into the hands of Roman administrators, beginning with the Census of Quirinius in 6 CE. The First Jewish–Roman War broke out in 66 CE. After a few years of conflict, the Romans retook Jerusalem and destroyed the temple, bringing an end to the Second Temple period in 70 CE.

===After the Temple destruction===
After the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in 70 CE, the Sadducees appear only in a few references in the Talmud and some Christian texts. In the beginning of Karaite Judaism, the followers of Anan ben David were called &quot;Sadducees&quot; and set a claim of the former being a historical continuity from the latter.

The Sadducee concept of the mortality of the soul is reflected on by Uriel da Costa, who mentions them in his writings.

== Role of the Sadducees ==

===Religious===
The religious responsibilities of the Sadducees included the maintenance of the Temple in Jerusalem. Their high social status was reinforced by their priestly responsibilities, as mandated in the Torah. The priests were responsible for performing sacrifices at the Temple, the primary method of worship in ancient Israel. This included presiding over sacrifices during the three festivals of pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Their religious beliefs and social status were mutually reinforcing, as the priesthood often represented the highest class in Judean society. However, Sadducees and the priests were not completely synonymous. Cohen writes that &quot;not all priests, high priests, and aristocrats were Sadducees; many were Pharisees, and many were not members of any group at all.&quot;

===Political===
The Sadducees oversaw many formal affairs of the state. Members of the Sadducees:
* Administered the state domestically
* Represented the state internationally
* Participated in the Sanhedrin, and often encountered the Pharisees there.
* Collected taxes. These also came in the form of international tribute from Jews in the Diaspora.
* Equipped and led the army
* Regulated relations with the Roman Empire
* Mediated domestic grievances

==Beliefs==
Knowledge about the beliefs of the Sadducees is limited by the fact that not a single line of their own writings has survived out of antiquity, as the destruction of Jerusalem and much of the Judean elite in 70 CE seems to have broken them. Extant writings on the Sadducees are often from sources hostile to them; Josephus was a rival Pharisee, Christian records were generally not sympathetic, and the rabbinic tradition (descended from the Pharisees) is uniformly hostile.

=== General ===
The Sadducees rejected the Oral Torah as proposed by the Pharisees. Rather, they saw the Written Torah as the sole source of divine authority. Later writings of the Pharisees criticized this belief as one that strengthened the Sadducees&#x27; own power.

According to Josephus, the Sadducees beliefs included:
* Rejection of the idea of fate or a pre-ordained future.
* God does not commit or even think evil.
* Man has free will; &quot;man has the free choice of good or evil&quot;.
* The soul is not immortal and there is no afterlife, and no rewards or penalties after death.
* It is a virtue to debate and dispute with philosophy teachers.

The Sadducees did not believe in resurrection of the dead, but believed (contrary to the claim of Josephus) in the traditional Jewish concept of Sheol for those who had died. Josephus also includes a claim that the Sadducees are rude compared to loving and compassionate Pharisees, but this is generally considered more of a sectarian insult rather than an unbiased judgment of the Sadducees on their own terms. Similarly, Josephus brags that the Sadducees were often forced to back down if their judgments clashed with the Pharisees, as he says that the Pharisees were more popular with the multitude.

The Sadducees occasionally show up in the Christian gospels, but without much detail: usually merely as parts of a list of opponents of Jesus. The Christian Acts of the Apostles contains somewhat more information:
* The Sadducees were associated with the party of the high priest of the era, and seem to have had a majority of the Sanhedrin, if not all (Gamaliel is a Pharisee member).
* The Sadducees did not believe in resurrection, whereas the Pharisees did. In Acts, Paul of Tarsus chose this point of division to attempt to gain the protection of the Pharisees (around 59 CE).
* The Sadducees rejected the notion of spirits or angels, whereas the Pharisees acknowledged them.

=== Disputes with the Pharisees ===
* According to the Sadducees, spilt water becomes ritually impure through its pouring. The Pharisees denied that this was sufficient grounds for impurity in Mishnah Yadaim 4:7. Many Pharisee–Sadducee disputes revolved around issues of ritual purity.
* According to the Jewish laws of inheritance, the property of a deceased man is inherited by his sons. If the man had only daughters, his property would be inherited by his daughters upon his death, according to Numbers 27:8. The Sadducees, however, whenever dividing the inheritance among the relatives of the deceased, such as when the deceased left no issue, would perfunctorily seek familial ties so that the near of kin to the deceased and who inherits his property could, hypothetically, be his paternal aunt. The Sadducees would justify their practice by &quot;a fortiori&quot;, an inference from minor to major premise, saying: &quot;If the daughter of his son&#x27;s son can inherit him (i.e., such as when her father left no male issue), is it not then fitting that his own daughter inherit him?!&quot; (i.e., who is more closely related to him than his great-granddaughter), according to the Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Baba Bathra&quot; 21b). The early Jewish sage Yohanan ben Zakkai tore down their argument, saying that the only reason the daughter was empowered to inherit her father was because her father left no male issue. However, a man&#x27;s daughter – where there are sons, has no power to inherit her father&#x27;s estate. Moreover, a deceased man who leaves no issue always has a distant male relative to whom his estate can be given. The Sadducees eventually agreed with the Pharisaic teaching. The vindication of Yohanan ben Zakkai and the Pharisees over the Sadducees gave rise to this date being held in honor in the &quot;Megillat Taanit&quot; according to the Rashbam in the Babylonian Talmud, &quot;Baba Bathra&quot; 115b–116a); Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Baba Bathra&quot; 8:1 [21b–22a])
* The Sadducees demanded that a master pay for damages caused by his slave. The Pharisees imposed no such obligation, viewing that a slave could intentionally cause damage to see the liability for it brought on his master in Mishnah Yadaim 4:7
* The Pharisees posited that false witnesses should be executed if the verdict was pronounced based on their testimony—even if not yet carried out. The Sadducees argued that false witnesses should be executed only if the death penalty had already been carried out on the falsely accused in Mishnah Makot 1.6.

Later rabbinic literature took a dim view of both the Sadducees and Boethusians, not only due to their perceived carefree approach to keeping to the Torah and the Oral Torah but also due to their attempts to persuade the common folk to join their ranks according to Sifri to Deuteronomy (p. 233, Torah Ve&#x27;Hamitzvah edition). Maimonides viewed the Sadducees as rejecting the Oral Torah as an excuse to interpret the Written Torah in a lenient, personally convenient manner in his commentary to &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot;, 1.3.1 1:3. He described the Sadducees as &quot;harming Israel and causing the nation to stray from following God&quot; in the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, Hilchoth Avodah Zarah 10:2.

==Jewish sectarianism==

The Jewish community of the Second Temple period is often defined by its sectarian and fragmented attributes. Josephus, in &quot;Antiquities&quot;, contextualizes the Sadducees as opposed to the Pharisees and the Essenes. The Sadducees are also notably distinguishable from the growing Jesus movement, which later evolved into Christianity. These groups differed in their beliefs, social statuses, and sacred texts. Though the Sadducees produced no primary works themselves, their attributes can be derived from other contemporaneous texts, including the New Testament, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and later, the Mishnah and Talmud. Overall, the Sadducees represented an aristocratic, wealthy, and traditional elite within the hierarchy.

===Opposition to the Essenes===
The Dead Sea Scrolls, which are often attributed to the Essenes, suggest clashing ideologies and social positions between the Essenes and the Sadducees. In fact, some scholars suggest that the Essenes originated as a sect of Zadokites, which would indicate that the group itself had priestly, and thus Sadducaic origins. Within the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Sadducees are often referred to as Manasseh. The scrolls suggest that the Sadducees (Manasseh) and the Pharisees (Ephraim) became religious communities that were distinct from the Essenes, the true Judah. Clashes between the Essenes and the Sadducees are depicted in the &quot;Pesher on Nahum&quot;, which states &quot;They [Manasseh] are the wicked ones ... whose reign over Israel will be brought down ... his wives, his children, and his infant will go into captivity. His warriors and his honored ones [will perish] by the sword.&quot; The reference to the Sadducees as those who reign over Israel corroborates their aristocratic status as opposed to the more fringe group of Essenes. Furthermore, it suggests that the Essenes challenged the authenticity of the rule of the Sadducees, blaming the downfall of ancient Israel and the siege of Jerusalem on their impiety. The Dead Sea Scrolls specify the Sadducaic elite as those who broke the covenant with God in their rule of the Judean state, and thus became targets of divine vengeance.

===Opposition to the early Christian church===

The New Testament, in the books of Mark, the Matthew, and the Luke, describe anecdotes which hint at hostility between Jesus and the Sadducaic establishment. A pericope in Mark 12 and Matthew 22 recounts a dispute between Jesus and a Sadducee who challenged the resurrection of the dead by asking who the husband of a resurrected woman would be who had been married to each of seven brothers at one point. Jesus responds by saying that the resurrected &quot;neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.&quot; He also insults them on their own terms as knowing neither the scriptures nor the power of God, presumably a claim that even though the Sadducee insisted on the written law, Jesus considered them to have gotten it wrong.

Matthew records John the Baptist calling both the Pharisees and Sadducees a &quot;brood of vipers&quot;.

===Opposition to the Pharisees===
Josephus, the author of the most extensive historical account of the Second Temple Period, gives a lengthy account of Jewish sectarianism in both &quot;The Jewish War&quot; and &quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot;. In &quot;Antiquities&quot;, he describes &quot;the Pharisees have delivered to the people a great many observances by succession from their fathers, which are not written in the law of Moses, and for that reason it is that the Sadducees reject them and say that we are to esteem those observance to be obligatory which are in the written word, but are not to observe what are derived from the tradition of our forefathers.&quot; The Sadducees rejected the Pharisaic use of the Oral Torah to enforce their claims to power, citing the Written Torah as the sole manifestation of divinity.

The rabbis, who are traditionally seen as the descendants of the Pharisees, describe the similarities and differences between the two sects in Mishnah Yadaim. The Mishnah explains that the Sadducees state, &quot;So too, regarding the Holy Scriptures, their impurity is according to (our) love for them. But the books of Homer, which are not beloved, do not defile the hands.&quot; A passage from the book of Acts suggests that both Pharisees and Sadducees collaborated in the Sanhedrin, the high Jewish court.
