<text>[[Poaceae]], also known as the true grasses, is the fourth largest plant family in the world with around 12,000 species and roughly 800 genera. They contain, among others, the cereal crop species and other plants of economic importance, such as the bamboos, and several important weeds.

Grasses probably originated in the understory of tropical rainforests in the Late Cretaceous, but have since come to occupy a wide range of different habitats. Notably, they are the dominant species in grasslands, open habitats that cover around one fifth of the earth&#x27;s terrestrial surface. The C4 photosynthetic pathway has evolved at least 22 times independently in the grasses; C4 species are more competitive than C3 plants in open habitats with high light intensity and warm temperatures.

The deeper relationships in the family have been resolved by recent molecular phylogenetic work. This has been translated into a modern classification which divides the grasses into twelve subfamilies and a number of tribes, with large tribes further divided into subtribes.

Anomochlooideae, Pharoideae and Puelioideae are early diverging lineages containing only a few species. Most of the diversity falls into the two big BOP and PACMAD clades, which each contain roughly half of the family&#x27;s species. C4 lineages have only evolved in the PACMAD clade, whereas many lineages in the BOP clade have evolved adaptations to cold climate.

While the higher-level classification of the grasses is now relatively well understood, taxonomic efforts continue at the species and genera level, and with continuing phylogenetic research, a number of names is likely to change. The list of genera below is therefore likely to evolve with further study.

<text>Ermine Street is a major Roman road in England that ran from London (&quot;Londinium&quot;) to Lincoln (&quot;Lindum Colonia&quot;) and York (&quot;Eboracum&quot;). The Old English name was &quot;Earninga Strǣt&quot; (1012), named after a tribe called the &quot;Earningas&quot;, who inhabited a district later known as &quot;Armingford Hundred&quot;, around Arrington, Cambridgeshire, and Royston, Hertfordshire. &quot;Armingford&quot;, and &quot;Arrington&quot; share the same Old English origin. The original Celtic and Roman names for the route remain unknown. It is also known as the Old North Road from London to where it joins the A1 Great North Road near Godmanchester.

==Course==
Ermine Street begins at Bishopsgate, where one of the seven gates in the wall surrounding Roman London was located. From here it runs north up Norton Folgate, Shoreditch High Street and Kingsland Road through Stoke Newington (forming Stoke Newington Road and Stoke Newington High Street), Tottenham, Edmonton and eastern Enfield (Ponders End, Enfield Highway, Enfield Wash and Freezywater) to Royston. This section of Ermine Street from London to Royston is now largely part of the A10. At this point it crosses the Icknield Way. From Royston, it was formerly the A14 to the A1 but now it is the A1198 to Godmanchester (&quot;Durovigutum&quot;). Ignoring bypasses and modern diversions, the road through Huntingdon to the Alconbury junction on the A1 gives the line. The section from Alconbury to Water Newton, ignoring modern bypasses such as that at Stilton, follows the A1. Ermine street used to pass through &quot;Durobrivae&quot;, the slight remains of which can be seen to the east, alongside the A1 at Peterborough. The modern road returns to Ermine Street north-west of Stamford, near Great Casterton, through which Ermine Street ran.

The post-Roman road wandered off for through Colsterworth, but Ermine Street continues as the B6403, through Ancaster to the A17. It then continues as a public right of way, easily walked, until Waddington airfield blocks it at . The route from Colsterworth, through Ancaster, to Bracebridge Heath is known as High Dike. It runs roughly parallel with and to the east of the A607 between Carlton Scroop and Harmston. High Dike takes to the level, open, dry country of the Lincolnshire Heath while the A607 wanders through the villages on the spring line below. From the Antonine Itinerary there is known to have been a Roman Settlement on the road in South Lincolnshire, called &quot;Causennae&quot; which has been variously identified with Ancaster Roman Town or Saltersford, south of Grantham.

Another long section remains, now the A15, running north out of Lincoln, past RAF Scampton and Caenby Corner, past Kirton in Lindsey at grid reference , and continuing almost to the Humber at Winteringham. Before the diversion was made round the extended runway at Scampton, with a very slight diversion at Broughton, it was possible to travel about , from the Newport Arch, the Roman north gate at Lincoln, to the Parish of Winteringham along a road so slightly curved as to be regarded as straight.

Roman Winteringham was the terminal for the ferry to &quot;Petuaria&quot; (Brough) on the north shore of the Humber. From there, the road curved westwards to York.

This landing place on the south shore of the Humber is significant because Winteringham translates as &quot;the homestead of Winta&#x27;s people&quot;. Apart from Woden, the god, the first leader on Lindsey&#x27;s list of kings is Winta. Clearly, the end of the Jurassic limestone ridge at the Humber was significant in the English settlement of Lincolnshire. Winterton is a little further inland. Ermine Street and the River Trent together were evidently an important early route of entry into early post-Roman Britain.

==Alternative courses==

The author Thomas Codrington proposed a more westerly route for &quot;Erming&quot; Street north of London, going via what is now Theobalds Park. This route is marked on many maps.

The Roman Map of Britain above shows a sector of Ermine Street for which there was an alternative route. As Ermine Street extended north out of Lincoln and past Scampton an alternative course of Ermine Street curved left and formed a semicircle on a wide heading west of the Humber Estuary. The straight northerly route, traced in red on the map, between Lincoln and York was the shorter, but was not passable over the Humber Estuary during adverse weather conditions. Thus an alternative route was established (see also Roman roads in Britain). This &#x27;alternative&#x27; route is detailed in the Antonine Itinerary and linked York (Eboracum), Castleford (Lagecium), Doncaster (Danum), Littleborough (Agelocum) and Lincoln (Lindum). Beginning at the modern Lincolnshire Showground the portion of this route in Lincolnshire is known as Till Bridge Lane, the modern A1500. The route in the Doncaster area, and again north of Castleford, is known as the Roman Ridge or Roman Rigg.

A large section of this road formed for many later centuries the Great North Road between Nottinghamshire and West Yorkshire.

<text>Bernard of Chartres (; died after 1124) was a twelfth-century French Neo-Platonist philosopher, scholar, and administrator.

== Life ==

The date and place of his birth are unknown. He was previously believed to have been the elder brother of Thierry of Chartres and to be of Breton origin, but research has shown that this is unlikely. He is recorded at the cathedral school of Chartres by 1115 and was chancellor until 1124. There is no proof that he was still alive after 1124.

== Contemporary accounts ==

Gilbert de la Porrée and William of Conches were students of his, and their writings reference his work, as do the writings of John of Salisbury. According to the latter, Bernard composed a prose treatise named &quot;De expositione Porphyrii&quot;, a metrical treatise on the same subject, a moral poem on education, and probably a fourth work seeking to reconcile Plato and Aristotle. Fragments of these treatises are found in John&#x27;s &quot;Metalogicon&quot; (IV, 35) and &quot;Policraticus&quot; (VII, 3). Hauréau confounds Bernard of Chartres with Bernardus Silvestris, and assigns to the former works which are to be ascribed to the latter.

The earliest attribution of the phrase &quot;standing on the shoulders of giants&quot; is to Bernard (by John of Salisbury):
== Doctrines ==

Bernard, like others of his school, studied the &quot;Timaeus&quot; and the Neo-Platonists more than Aristotle&#x27;s dialectical treatises and Boethius&#x27;s commentaries. Consequently, he not only discussed the problem of universals (distinguishing between the abstract, the process, and the concrete—exemplified, for instance, by the Latin words &quot;albedo&quot;, &quot;albet&quot;, and &quot;album&quot;) but also addressed problems of metaphysics and cosmology.

=== Metaphysics ===

According to Bernard, there are three categories of reality: God, matter, and idea. God is supreme reality. Matter was brought out of nothingness by God&#x27;s creative act and is the element which, in union with Ideas, constitutes the world of sensible things. Ideas are the prototypes by means of which the world was from all eternity present to the Divine Mind; they constitute the world of Providence (&quot;in qua omnia semel et simul fecit Deus&quot;), and are eternal but not coeternal with God. According to John of Salisbury, Bernard also taught that there exist native forms—copies of the Ideas created with matter—which are alone united with matter. It is difficult, however, to determine what was Bernard&#x27;s doctrine on this point. It is sufficient to note that he reproduced in his metaphysical doctrines many of the characteristic traits of Platonism and Neo-Platonism: the intellect as the habitat of Ideas, the world-soul, eternal matter, matter as the source of imperfection, etc.

=== Cosmology ===

Bernard argued that matter, although caused by God, existed from all eternity. In the beginning, before its union with the Ideas, it was in a chaotic condition. It was by means of the native forms, which penetrate matter, that distinction, order, regularity, and number were introduced into the universe.

==Glosses on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;==

Paul Edward Dutton has shown that a set of anonymous glosses on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; must be attributed to Bernard. These glosses edited by Dutton are Bernard&#x27;s only extant work.

<text>The New Orleans Rhythm Kings (NORK) were one of the most influential jazz bands of the early to mid-1920s. The band included New Orleans and Chicago musicians who helped shape Chicago jazz and influenced many younger jazz musicians.

They composed and recorded several jazz standards such as &quot;Bugle Call Rag&quot;, &quot;Milenburg Joys&quot;, &quot;Farewell Blues&quot;, and &quot;Tin Roof Blues&quot;. The 1954 pop song &quot;Make Love to Me&quot; was based on their music for &quot;Tin Roof Blues&quot;.

==History==

The New Orleans Rhythm Kings in its earliest stages was the creation of the drummer Mike &quot;Ragbaby&quot; Stevens, solely in that he sent the first telegram to Albert Brunies about going to Chicago to form a band and find better gigs than New Orleans had to offer. Albert &quot;Abbie&quot; Brunies and his younger brother, the trombonist George Brunies, were initially hesitant but suggested the idea to a friend, the trumpet player Paul Mares, who immediately took the opportunity. 

&quot;So I says Paul, I says, Abbie don&#x27;t want to go to Chicago and I&#x27;m kind of leery, I&#x27;m afraid&quot;, George recalled. &quot;Paul says, &#x27;man, give me that wire. I&#x27;ll go.&#x27; So Paul went up [to Chicago] and introduced himself to Ragbaby Stevens and Ragbaby liked him… and Paul got the railroad fare from his father and sent me $60&quot;.

George Brunies packed his trombone and set off to join Mares in Chicago, playing gigs and going to after-hours clubs with Mares. At one such club the pair met some of their future bandmates, the drummer Frank Snyder, the pianist Elmer Schoebel, and the saxophonist Jack Pettis. 

The name &quot;New Orleans Rhythm Kings&quot; did not initially refer to this group but rather was the name of a group under the direction of Bee Palmer, a vaudeville performer. Palmer&#x27;s group did not last, but within several months of the breakup of the band, a member of the group, the clarinetist Leon Roppolo, was playing on riverboats in Chicago with Elmer Schoebel, Jack Pettis, Frank Snyder, George Brunies, the banjoist Louis Black and (possibly) Paul Mares. 
Mares, ready to move on from riverboat life, found the group an engagement at the Friar&#x27;s Inn, a club owned by Mike Fritzel. The bassist Arnold Loyocano joined forces with the growing band, and thus began the group&#x27;s engagement at the Friar&#x27;s Inn, which lasted 17 months beginning in 1921. During this time the group performed as the Friar&#x27;s Society Orchestra.

While at the Friar&#x27;s Inn, the group attracted the interest not only of fans but of other musicians. The cornetist Bix Beiderbecke, who had been sent to school in Chicago by his parents in the hopes of removing him from jazz influences, regularly attended their shows and was often allowed to perform with the band.

The group recorded a series of records for Gennett Records in 1922 and 1923. On July 17 and 18 1923, they were joined by the pianist and composer Jelly Roll Morton. These sessions with Morton have sometimes been incorrectly called the first mixed-race recording session; while they are noteworthy, early examples, there were earlier instances such as the 1919 Gennett and Okeh recording of Creole clarinetists Achille Bauquet in Jimmy Durante&#x27;s New Orleans Jazz Band. 

After their engagement at the Friar&#x27;s Inn ended, the New Orleans Rhythm Kings were largely scattered and disorganized. They re-formed periodically to make recordings, with significant member turnover (Roppolo and Mares were more or less the leaders and constants of the group), but the group never played all together again. They went their separate ways: Paul Mares continued to play music, releasing a record in 1935 and ran the P&amp;M New Orleans Barbeque with his wife in the late 1930s. Leon Roppolo was (and always had been) mentally unstable and spent the last years of his life in and out of institutions until his early death in 1943, though he managed to keep playing music as best he could. Most of the other members of the NORK also kept successful musical careers after the group dissolved.

==Recordings==
In 1922 the group released the first of several records for Gennett Records, located in Richmond, Indiana. Gennett&#x27;s studio was next to a railroad track, which was cursed by many frustrated musicians whose recording sessions were disturbed by the rattling trains. In the first session at Gennett, the Friars Society Orchestra (the name under which the recording was released) recorded eight songs: &quot;Panama&quot;, &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;, and &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot;, representing the New Orleans jazz standbys; the original compositions &quot; Oriental&quot;, &quot;Discontented Blues&quot;, and &quot;Farewell Blues&quot;; and a never-released Original Dixieland Jazz Band song, &quot;Eccentric&quot;.

Paul Mares scheduled another two-day recording session at Gennett later, but the band had recently dissolved somewhat, moving in different directions following their stint at the Friar&#x27;s Inn. For the session Mares got Brunies, Roppolo, Stitzel, and Pollack together to release a record as the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, the first time the name had been used since it had referred to Bee Palmer&#x27;s travelling vaudeville act. 

The group&#x27;s recordings demonstrate a more serious, crafted style than that of the then-famous Original Dixieland Jazz Band (ODJB). While the ODJB advertised their music as a novelty act, the NORK sought to distance themselves from the popular image of jazz as a novelty and instead marketed it as a genuine musical genre.

The third recording session occurred after Mares and Roppolo had spent some time playing in a small band in New York City. They returned to Chicago and scheduled another session with Gennett Records as the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. This session is notable because of the participation of famed jazz pianist and arranger Ferdinand &quot;Jelly Roll&quot; Morton. Morton was a Creole from New Orleans, and though he identified strongly with the white &quot;French&quot; side of being Creole, he was generally viewed by society as black (though he was fairly light-skinned and could sometimes &quot;pass&quot; as Latin-American) and therefore was subjected to many of the same social pressures as other blacks of the day. In 1923 the country was still largely racially segregated, as were jazz bands. White bands were beginning to spring up attempting to imitate the &quot;hot&quot; jazz style that the black musicians played, but rarely did any racial mixing occur in a professional setting (In a non-professional setting, however it was becoming more and more common). Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s participation in recording with the all white New Orleans Rhythm Kings was history in the making: it is an early example of mixed race recordings. 
Mares and Roppolo went on to conduct two more recording sessions in New Orleans as the New Orleans Rhythm Kings in 1925 before the group dissolved altogether and its members went their separate ways.

===Record reissues===
A significant period of time after NORK disbanded, several record labels began reissuing the band&#x27;s material. The first revival was by Riverside Records, which reissued NORK&#x27;s Gennett recordings. The second reissue was from Milestone Records. Both of these reissues were important in keeping NORK&#x27;s music commercially available and boosting their visibility to critics and historians. In the 1990s Milestone released the band&#x27;s Gennett sides on compact disc. Six of the first eight recordings for Gennett under the Friars Society Orchestra name are on disk A of the four-CD &quot;Gennett Jazz&quot; set issued by JSP Records (JSP926). In 2019 Rivermont Records released a two-CD set featuring new transfers by Doug Benson. Using newly developed restoration technology, Benson stabilized the intermittent speed fluctuations that affected records from the band&#x27;s 1922 session as Friar&#x27;s Society Orchestra.

Compositions and arrangements by the New Orleans Rhythm Kings continue to be played by &quot;traditional jazz&quot; or Dixieland bands all over the world today. Some of their famous compositions and contributions to the jazz repertory include &quot;Bugle Call Rag&quot;, &quot;Milenburg Joys&quot;, &quot;Farewell Blues&quot;, &quot;Angry&quot;, &quot;Baby&quot;, &quot;Discontented Blues&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Crying for Me&quot;, &quot;Oriental&quot;, &quot;I Never Knew What a Girl Could Do&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Somebody Blues&quot;, and &quot;Tin Roof Blues&quot;.

&quot;Make Love to Me&quot;, a 1954 pop song by Jo Stafford, using the New Orleans Rhythm King&#x27;s music from the 1923 jazz standard &quot;Tin Roof Blues&quot;, became a number 1 hit. Anne Murray and B. B. King also recorded &quot;Make Love to Me&quot;. Jo Stafford&#x27;s recording of &quot;Make Love to Me&quot; was number 1 for three weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart and number 2 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; chart.

===NORK sound===

The ODJB and the NORK were the two leading white bands of the day, but their musical styles were very different. As opposed to the short, choppy style of the ODJB, NORK played more legato pieces. Leon Roppolo&#x27;s famous clarinet sound gave the band its characteristic, bluesy feel.
Richard M. Sudhalter, in his book &quot;Lost Chords: White Musicians and Their Contributions to Jazz&quot;, wrote that 
&quot;Three takes of &#x27;Tin Roof Blues&#x27; exist, three opportunities to listen to Roppolo&#x27;s mind at work, arranging and rearranging the pieces of his elegiac little statement. He begins all three on his high G (concert F), ends all three on the same two-bar resolution. But the differences in between, matters of tone, dynamics, and shading as much as specific notes, are spellbinding.

&quot;This solo, in each of its three variants, contains many &#x27;bent&#x27; notes, the exact pitches of which resist attempts at formal notation. In certain cases…. a sustained note will have both a &#x27;sharp&#x27; sign and a &#x27;flat&#x27; sign above it, indicating a progression from one pitch variation to the other, in the order given.&quot;
Earlier in the same chapter, Sudhalter described the full band&#x27;s sound in their first Gennett recordings:

&quot;The notion of tunefulness implies particular attention to the aesthetics of sound. The tutti passages on &#x27;Farewell Blues&#x27;, with their echoes of railroad whistles, the carefully arranged interludes and fadeout ending on Schoebel&#x27;s unusual &#x27;Discontented Blues&#x27;, bespeak rehearsal and behind-the-scenes work aimed at achieving a polished and varied band sound. Nothing on any record by a black band of the early &#x27;20s is anywhere near as aesthetically venturesome.

==Race and cultural context==

At its roots, New Orleans jazz (which influenced Chicago jazz) represented an assimilation of Southern black traditions carried over from their African heritage mixed with white European traditions. The instrumentation was European (trumpets, trombones, etc.), while the melodic ideas and unconventional (at least, in the context of classical music) rhythms and musical forms were born from the ring shouts and country blues styles of black slaves. The very first jazz bands were mostly black and played for black audiences, though the genre progressively got picked up by white audiences too. Many of the musicians were unable to read music but instead relied heavily on head arrangements (learning the arrangement by ear and then committing it to memory) and an ability to improvise. In many other cases the musicians could read music, but white audiences were so captivated by the improvisational ability that they were convinced was inherent in black musicians that the musicians would memorize the arrangement beforehand and appear to improvise to cater to the expectations of white audiences. 
The New Orleans Rhythm Kings represents a contingent of white jazz bands that emerged from 1915 to the early 1920s. These bands, perhaps the best-known of which was the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, attempted to imitate the fast virtuosic style of their black counterparts.
&quot;The relatively small inner circles of acute jazz listeners in the 1920s recognized that black musicians played better, more mature, and more confident jazz&quot;.
Despite a significant bias that only black musicians could play &quot;real&quot; jazz, white bands such as the New Orleans Rhythm Kings and the Original Dixieland Jazz Band emerged and were successful, especially in their recordings. &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot; recorded by the ODJB in 1917 personified the vaudevillian style that white audiences sought in jazz: choppy, comedic, almost poking fun at itself with its animal sounds.
The New Orleans Rhythm Kings, however, brought a new flavor to recorded jazz. NORK and ODJB were not the first white jazz bands (there were many others that played around Chicago and New Orleans), but they were some of the first to make recordings, and the New Orleans Rhythm Kings was one of the first white jazz bands to make mixed-race recordings (with Jelly Roll Morton, a creole).

<text>Paul Mares (June 15, 1900 – August 18, 1949), was an American early dixieland jazz cornet and trumpet player, and leader of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings.

Mares established himself as a respected bandleader over a group of wild and strong-willed musicians, as The New Orleans Rhythm Kings (N.O.R.K.) became one of the best-regarded bands in Chicago in the early 1920s.

In January 1935 Mares played trumpet on, and fronted, a recording session with a band called &quot;Paul Mares and his Friars Society Orchestra&quot; - a name that referred to the Friar&#x27;s Inn club where the N.O.R.K. had first played in Chicago. The 1935 band included the white New Orleanian and N.O.R.K. veteran Santo Pecora on trombone, the black New Orleanian Omar Simeon on clarinet, and the Chicagoan altoist Boyce Brown, as well as George Wettling on drums, Jess Stacy on piano, Pat Pattison on bass, and Marvin Saxbe on guitar.

<text>Leon Joseph Roppolo (March 16, 1902 – October 5, 1943) was an American early jazz clarinetist, best known for his playing with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. He also played saxophone and guitar.

==Life and career==

Leon Roppolo (nicknamed &quot;Rap&quot; and sometimes misspelled as &quot;Rappolo&quot;) was born in Lutcher, Louisiana, United States, up-river from New Orleans. His family, of Sicilian origin, moved to the Uptown neighborhood of New Orleans about 1912. His first instrument was the violin. He was a fan of the marching bands he heard in the streets of New Orleans, and wanted to play clarinet. An older relative with the same name played that instrument in Papa Jack Laine&#x27;s Reliance Brass Band.

Roppolo soon excelled at the clarinet, and played youthful jobs with his friends Paul Mares and George Brunies for parades, parties, and at Milneburg on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. At the age of 15 he decided to leave home to travel with the band of Bee Palmer, which soon became the nucleus for the New Orleans Rhythm Kings.

The Rhythm Kings became (along with King Oliver&#x27;s band) one of the best regarded hot jazz bands in Chicago in the early 1920s. Roppolo&#x27;s style influenced many younger Chicago musicians, most notably Benny Goodman. Some critics have called Roppolo&#x27;s work on the Rhythm Kings Gennett Records the first recorded jazz solos.

After the breakup of the Rhythm Kings in Chicago, Roppolo and Paul Mares headed east to try their luck on the New York City jazz scene. Contemporary musicians recalled Roppolo making some recordings with Original Memphis Five and California Ramblers musicians in New York in 1924. These sides were presumably unissued, or if issued unidentified.

Roppolo and Mares then returned home to New Orleans where they briefly reformed the Rhythm Kings and made some more recordings. After this, Roppolo worked with other New Orleans bands such as the Halfway House Orchestra, with which he recorded on saxophone.
Roppolo exhibited ever more eccentric behavior and violent temper. This was finally too much for his family to take, and Leon was committed to the state mental hospital in 1925. Some writers have speculated that he was suffering from tertiary syphilis.

==Death==
Leon Roppolo died in New Orleans at the age of 41, and is buried in Greenwood Cemetery, within sight of the old Halfway House building where he played for years.

==Compositions==
Roppolo&#x27;s compositions include the jazz standards &quot;Farewell Blues&quot; and &quot;Milenberg Joys&quot;, &quot;Gold Leaf Strut&quot; or &quot;Golden Leaf Strut&quot;, &quot;Tin Roof Blues&quot; (1923), and &quot;Make Love to Me&quot;, which was a pop song using Leon Roppolo&#x27;s music (from &quot;Tin Roof Blues&quot;), recorded by Jo Stafford (in 1954), and later by Anne Murray and B. B. King.

==Personal life==
Roppolo married Mabel Alice Branchard on 17 May 1920 in New Orleans. They had one child, Epifanio Leon Roppolo.

<doc id="181934" wikidata="Q544321" url="?curid=181934" title="Simon of Trent">
<text>Simon of Trent (, also known as Simon Unverdorben (meaning Simon Immaculate in German); ), also known as Simeon (1472–1475), was a young boy from the city of Trent (now Trento in northern Italy), in the Prince-Bishopric of Trent, whose disappearance and death was judicially attributed to be the city&#x27;s Jewish community, based on evidence of exsanguination.

==Events==
At the time of the events, Prince-Bishop Johannes Hinderbach reigned in Trent under the ultimate jurisdiction of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III. In March 1475, an itinerant Franciscan preacher, Bernardine of Feltre, delivered a series of sermons in Trent that vilified the local Jews, essentially three households headed by Samuel (who arrived in 1461), Tobias, and Engel. They formed a distinct community marked by their professions and by their apparent wealth in comparison with the artisans and sharecroppers of the city: Samuel was a moneylender and Tobias a physician. The Prince-Bishop had renewed the Jewish community&#x27;s permission to reside and practice their professions in Trent a few years previously, in 1469. This dependence on the protection of the authorities later inclined the Jews, upon finding Simon&#x27;s body, to report the discovery.

The events themselves have been reconstructed from a careful study of the trial records by American historian Ronnie Hsia. Simon, almost two and a half years old, went missing about 5 p.m. on the evening of Thursday, 23 March 1475. The following day, Good Friday, Simon&#x27;s father approached the prince-bishop to ask for help in finding his missing child. The podestà, Giovanni de Salis, had his men spread a description of Simon through the city. Over the following couple of days, searches were carried out by Simon&#x27;s family and neighbours, by the servants of the podestà, and also by the Jewish community, who had been alerted to a rumour that they had taken the child and were concerned about the possibility of being framed. On Saturday, 25 March, Simon&#x27;s father appealed to the podestà specifically to search the Jews&#x27; houses, saying he had been advised they might have taken his child. Despite these searches, no sign of the child was found. Samuel&#x27;s property was extensive, including a hall that functioned as a synagogue, and a water cellar that was also used for ritual bathing and was supplied with water from a channel that ran beneath the property. According to the trial record, on Easter Sunday, 26 March, a cook named Seligman went to Samuel&#x27;s cellar to fetch water to prepare the evening meal and found Simon&#x27;s body in the water. Samuel himself, accompanied by two other Jews, went to the podestà to report the discovery. Later that evening, the podestà and some of his men retrieved the body, with his servant Ulrich being ordered to carry it to the hospital. The narrative summary based on the trial documents, drafted in 1478–1479, omitted the fact that the Jews had themselves reported finding the body, stating only that Ulrich had found Simon&#x27;s body in a ditch next to Samuel&#x27;s house.

Following the report of the body&#x27;s discovery, the entire Jewish community (both men and women) were arrested and forced under torture to confess to having murdered Simon to use his blood for ritual purposes (a classic example of the blood libel that Jews used Christian blood in their rituals). An examination of the corpse by city doctors determined that Simon had not died of natural causes but had been exsanguinated. In Hsia&#x27;s view, &quot;the narrative imperative, the official story of ritual murder, the trial record of 1475–76, represents nothing less than a Christian ethnography of Jewish rites&quot;.

Fifteen of the Jews, including Samuel, the head of the community, were sentenced to death and burnt at the stake. The Jewish women were accused as accomplices but argued their gender did not allow them to participate in the rituals restricted to men. They were freed from prison in 1478 due to papal intervention. One Jew, Israel, was allowed to convert to Christianity for a short while, but he was arrested again after other Jews confessed he was part of the Passover Seder. After a long period of torture he was also sentenced to death on 19 January. The Trent trial&#x27;s notoriety inspired a rise in Christian violence towards Jews in the surrounding areas of Veneto, Lombardy, and Tyrol, along with accusations of ritual murder, culminating in Vicenza with the prohibition of Jewish moneylending in 1479 and the expulsion of all Jews in 1486.

==Papal investigation==
On 3 August 1475, Pope Sixtus IV commanded Bishop Hinderbach to suspend judicial proceedings until the arrival of the papal representative, Battista dei Giudici, Bishop of Ventimiglia, who would conduct a joint investigation with the Bishop of Trent. Giudici arrived in Trent in September. The local authorities worked against his investigation, preventing him from visiting Jews in prison and impeding his access to trial records.

In the face of persistent hostility, he relocated to Rovereto, which was then under Venetian control, and summoned Hinderbach and the podestà to answer for their conduct. Instead of appearing, Hinderbach had an account of the proceedings drawn up to vindicate his own actions, circulating it widely and so giving general credence to the notion that Simon of Trent had in fact been murdered by Jews.

The case was reviewed in Rome, where Hinderbach had powerful friends, including the papal librarian Bartolomeo Sacchi, who accused Giudici of being in the pay of the Jews. Giudici wrote two treatises on the affair, an &quot;Apologia Iudaeorum&quot; defending the Jews, and an &quot;Invectiva contra Platinam&quot; (aimed at Sacchi) defending himself. A committee of cardinals, chaired by Giovan Francesco Pavini, former professor of canon law at the University of Padua and an old friend of the bishop of Trent, exonerated Hinderbach and censured Giudici. A papal bull was issued on 20 June 1478, accepting that the inquiries in Trent had been carried out in legal fashion but avoiding a finding of fact with regard to Simon&#x27;s death, while also reasserting papal protection for the Jews and the unlawfulness of ritual murder trials, in line with a decree of Pope Innocent IV from 1243.

==Veneration== 

Simon became the focus of attention for the local Catholic Church. The local bishop, Hinderbach of Trent, tried to have Simon canonized, producing a large body of documentation of the event and its aftermath. Over one hundred miracles were directly attributed to Simon within a year of his disappearance, and his cult spread across Italy, Austria and Germany. However, there was also skepticism from the beginning, as Giudici&#x27;s investigation showed.

Maximilian I, a future Holy Roman Emperor, was a strong proponent of Simon&#x27;s veneration and commissioned a silver monument of the child. He also had Simon&#x27;s relics carried in procession when he was made emperor in 1508.

The veneration received wider liturgical impetus in the 16th century. Joannes Molanus included a footnote on Simon of Trent in his 1568 edition of Usuard&#x27;s martyrology, and this was then incorporated into the new official edition of the &quot;Martyrologium Romanum&quot; in 1583, with 24 March having the additional text: &quot;Tridenti passio sancti Simeonis pueri, a Judaeis saevissime trucidati, qui multis postea miraculis coruscavit.&quot; (&quot;At Trent, the suffering of the holy boy Simeon, barbarously murdered by the Jews, who was afterwards glorified by many miracles.&quot;) In 1584 the use of this martyrology became obligatory in the Roman Rite. Furthermore, in 1588 Pope Sixtus V gave recognition to the local veneration of Simon as an established devotion, functionally equivalent to a decree of beatification.

In 1758, Cardinal Ganganelli (later Pope Clement XIV, 1769–1774) prepared a legal memorandum which, to the exclusion of all other allegations of ritual murders of infants the records of which were thoroughly made available to him, expressly admitted as proven only two: that of Simon of Trent and that of Andreas Oxner. At the same time, he extolled the glories and accomplishments of the Jewish people across history, writing that the murder of Simon of Trent did not suffice to injure the reputation of the entire Jewish people.

Simon&#x27;s cultus was permitted by the Popes for local public liturgical observance (effectively beatification) within the Diocese of Trent. In a letter to , Promoter of Faith, Pope Benedict XIV recognised that this was the case, but was careful to distinguish such authorization from canonization.

As was stated in one publication, &quot;It is simply untrue to say that the Church has &quot;canonized&quot; little Simon of Trent. A decree of beatification was issued by Sixtus V, which took the form simply of a confirmation of cultus and which allowed a Mass to be said locally in honour of the boy martyr. Everyone knows that beatification differs from canonization in this, that in the former case the infallibility of the Holy See is not involved, in the latter it is.&quot;

Following studies on the case, on 28 October 1965 (the same day as the publication of &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; by Pope Paul VI) archbishop of Trent abolished the cult of Simon, and the yearly procession where his relics were suppressed. Simon of Trent is not in the new Roman Martyrology of 2000, nor on any modern Catholic calendar. His relics, removed from their resting place in upon the cult&#x27;s suppression, were returned there in 2021, together with an exhibit about him curated by the &quot;&quot;.

==Controversies==
In the 21st century, historian Ariel Toaff, writing about the case of Simon of Trent, hypothesized that the notion that some Jews killed children to use their blood for ritual purposes may have been tenuously based on an actual &quot;ritual of blood&quot; that did not involve infanticide. In the same work, &quot;Passovers of Blood&quot;, Toaff theorises that some blood libel cases may be based on actual instances of infanticide where a Jewish perpetrator acted in retaliation for persecutions against the community. After criticism, the book was withdrawn from circulation and redacted by its author.

In 2020, the Italian artist painted a depiction of Simon&#x27;s death. He was later accused of antisemitism for this painting which was sold to a private collector.

In February 2022, a sculpture of Simon of Trent depicting the blood libel was used by QAnon conspiracy theorists to promote the conspiracy theory that Hollywood elites are harvesting adrenochrome from children through Satanic ritual abuse in order to become immortal.

<text>Don Murray (June 7, 1904 – June 2, 1929) was an American jazz clarinet and saxophone player.

==Early life==
Murray was born in Joliet, Illinois, and attended high school in Chicago. In his teens, he made a name for himself as one of the best young jazz clarinetists and saxophonists in the city.

== Career ==
In 1923, Murray recorded with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings; according to Rhythm Kings leader Paul Mares, Murray was not a regular member of the band, but was a friend who sometimes sat in with them. Murray also made early recordings with Muggsy Spanier. He then joined the Detroit, Michigan based band of Jean Goldkette, with whom he remained until 1927. It was here that he mentored the young Jimmy Dorsey. He also played baritone saxophone on some recordings with Joe Venuti and Eddie Lang, under the band name “Joe Venuti’s Blue Four” playing the baritone saxophone very much like Adrian Rollini’s bass saxophone style. 

After a brief stint with Adrian Rollini&#x27;s band, during which he contributed to several highly regarded recordings by Bix Beiderbecke, Murray was hired by Ted Lewis. Ted Lewis said that Murray was the greatest clarinetist he ever had in his band. Murray can be heard on the soundtrack of the Ted Lewis film &quot;Is Everybody Happy?&quot; (1929), which is considered a &quot;lost film.&quot;

In 2021, the Bix Beiderbecke Museum and World Archives in Davenport, Iowa, announced that it would raise $12,000 to renovate its permanent exhibit, including Murray&#x27;s saxophone.

== Death ==
Murray died in 1929 at a Los Angeles hospital after injuries sustained in an automobile accident. Apparently, he was standing on the running board of a moving roadster and fell; he struck the back of his head on the pavement and was then hospitalized with serious head injury. Murray is buried at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Skokie, Illinois.

<doc id="181946" wikidata="Q1338726" url="?curid=181946" title="Emmett Hardy">
<text>Emmett Louis Hardy (June 12, 1903 – June 16, 1925) was an American jazz cornet player during the early 1900s.

==Early life==
Hardy was born in the New Orleans suburb of Gretna, Louisiana, United States, and lived much of his life in the Algiers neighborhood, on the west bank of New Orleans. Hardy was a child prodigy, described as already playing marvelously in his early teens. Some New Orleans musicians remembered as a musical highlight of their lives, a 1919 cutting contest where, after long and intense struggle, Hardy succeeded in outplaying Louis Armstrong. (It is likely that Armstrong, although two years older than Hardy, had not yet hit his full stride at that time.)

==Career==
In Hardy&#x27;s early teens, he was a member of Papa Jack Laine&#x27;s band, then worked in the Carlisle Evans Band and Norman Brownlee&#x27;s Orchestra of New Orleans. He belonged to a small band that supported singer Bee Palmer. After moving to Chicago, he became a member of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. For a time during its Friar&#x27;s Inn residency/ the NORK used a two-cornet format – Paul Mares, leader and first cornet, and Emmett Hardy as second. As with other New Orleans jazz bands of that time (such as King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band and The Original Tuxedo Orchestra), the more creative player played the second part, with the first cornet staying closer to the lead line. Hardy did not appear on any of the Rhythm Kings recording sessions, never making any commercial recordings before his early death.

After returning to New Orleans in the early 1920s, he led his own band and played in the band of Norman Brownlee.

==Technique==
Hardy&#x27;s playing is described as being more lyrical than many of his New Orleans contemporaries, but with a driving rhythm. His tone was much admired.

&quot;Emmet... always preferred playing in some screwy, plenty tough keys like B-natural, F-sharp, C-sharp, D-flat, and E-natural, using all those keys on one tune and making his own modulations into and out of choruses. His tone was pure and wonderful and it sorta rolled forth, except with a drive like I&#x27;ve never heard anyone else get.&quot; —Monk Hazel, &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine, May 15, 1940 Hardy was an important influence on Bix Beiderbecke, and Monk Hazel pointed out that Beiderbecke on the Wolverines records sounded very much like Hardy.

:&quot;It’s no wonder that later, after the Wolverine era when Bix was forging ahead with Goldkette and Whiteman, Beiderbecke modestly paid tribute to Hardy as his greatest inspiration, and that he even wrote Emmet’s mother late in 1925 saying &#x27;Emmet was the greatest musician I have ever heard. If ever I can come near your son’s greatness I&#x27;ll die happy.&#x27;&quot;—Dave Dexter Jr., &quot;Down Beat&quot;, June 1, 1940

==Personality==
Hardy also did metal work, made his own mouthpieces for his horn, and modified his cornet to add an additional spit-valve. A relative remembered Hardy as being somewhat shy and unassuming, with a good dry sense of humor; that he was easily frightened by sudden loud noises, and superstitious about passing by graveyards.

==Illness and death==
When advancing tuberculosis started to make breathing difficult, Hardy taught himself banjo so he could continue playing music.

Hardy and some of his musician friends made some home recordings on wax phonograph cylinders for their own amusement. As Hardy&#x27;s tuberculosis worsened and his death seemed inevitable, the friends decided to preserve the cylinders as a memento of Hardy&#x27;s playing. At least one cylinder survived to the start of the 1950s; the relative who heard it then said Hardy&#x27;s playing reminded him of Sharkey Bonano. When Tulane University&#x27;s Jazz Archive was established in the late 1950s, however, a diligent search failed to turn up any of these recordings, which are presumed lost forever.

Hardy died of tuberculosis in New Orleans, just four days after his 22nd birthday, and was buried in Gretna, Louisiana.

<text>Yad Vashem (; ) is Israel&#x27;s official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. It is dedicated to preserving the memory of the Jews who were murdered; echoing the stories of the survivors; honoring Jews who fought against their Nazi oppressors and gentiles who selflessly aided Jews in need; and researching the phenomenon of the Holocaust in particular and genocide in general, with the aim of avoiding such events in the future. Yad Vashem&#x27;s vision, as stated on its website, is: &quot;To lead the documentation, research, education and commemoration of the Holocaust, and to convey the chronicles of this singular Jewish and human event to every person in Israel, to the Jewish people, and to every significant and relevant audience worldwide.&quot;

Established in 1953, Yad Vashem is located on the Mount of Remembrance, on the western slope of Mount Herzl, a height in western Jerusalem, above sea level and adjacent to the Jerusalem Forest. The memorial consists of a complex containing two types of facilities: some dedicated to the scientific study of the Holocaust, and memorials and museums catering to the needs of the larger public. Among the former there are an International Research Institute for Holocaust Research, an archives, a library, a publishing house and the International School for Holocaust Studies; the latter include the Holocaust History Museum, memorial sites such as the Children&#x27;s Memorial and the Hall of Remembrance, the Museum of Holocaust Art, sculptures, outdoor commemorative sites such as the Valley of the Communities, as well as a synagogue.

A core goal of Yad Vashem&#x27;s founders was to recognize non-Jews who, at personal risk and without financial or evangelistic motives, chose to save Jews from the ongoing genocide during the Holocaust. Those recognized by Israel as Righteous Among the Nations are honored in a section of Yad Vashem known as the Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations.

Yad Vashem is the second-most-visited Israeli tourist site, after the Western Wall, with approximately one million visitors each year. It charges no admission fee.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Yad Vashem&quot; is taken from a verse in the Book of Isaiah (56:5):
&quot;[To] them will I give in my house and within my walls a [memorial] and a [name], better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting [name], that shall not be cut off [from memory].&quot;
 ). Naming the Holocaust memorial &quot;yad vashem&quot; (, &quot;yād wā-šêm&quot;, literally &quot;a memorial and a name&quot;) conveys the idea of establishing a national depository for the names of Jewish victims who have no one to carry their name after death. The original verse referred to eunuchs who, although they could not have children, could still live for eternity with the Lord.

==History==
The desire to establish a memorial in the historical Jewish homeland for Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust originated during World War II, in response to emerging accounts of the mass murder of Jews in Nazi-occupied countries. Yad Vashem was first proposed in September 1942, at a board meeting of the Jewish National Fund, by Mordecai Shenhavi, a member of Kibbutz Mishmar Ha&#x27;emek. In August 1945, the plan was discussed in greater detail at a Zionist meeting in London. A provisional board of Zionist leaders was established that included David Remez as chairman, Shlomo Zalman Shragai, Baruch Zuckerman, and Shenhavi. In February 1946, Yad Vashem opened an office in Jerusalem and a branch office in Tel Aviv, and in June that year convened its first plenary session. In July 1947, the First Conference on Holocaust Research was held at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. However, the outbreak of the 1947–1949 Palestine war brought operations to a standstill for two years.

On 19 August 1953, the Knesset, Israel&#x27;s Parliament, unanimously passed the Yad Vashem Law, establishing the Holocaust Martyrs&#x27; and Heroes&#x27; Remembrance Authority, the aim of which was &quot;the commemoration in the Homeland of all those members of the Jewish people who gave their lives, or rose up and fought the Nazi enemy and its collaborators,&quot; and to set up &quot;a memorial to them, and to the communities, organizations and institutions that were destroyed because they belonged to the Jewish people.&quot;
On 29 July 1954, the cornerstone for the Yad Vashem building was laid on a hill in western Jerusalem, to be known as the Mount of Remembrance (); the organization had already begun projects to collect the names of individuals killed in the Holocaust; acquire Holocaust documentation and personal testimonies of survivors for the Archives and Library; and develop research and publications. The memorial and museum opened to the public in 1957.

The location of Yad Vashem on the western side of Mount Herzl – an area devoid of weighty historical associations, distinct from the Chamber of the Holocaust, founded in 1948 on Mount Zion – was chosen because it was far from the Jerusalem city center, and the founders of the memorial site did not want to erect a grim, sorrowful memorial, amidst population concentration. The conceptual connection of &quot;From Holocaust to Rebirth&quot; was made only with hindsight: Only in 2003 the Connecting Path between Yad Vashem and the National Cemetery in Mount Herzl was created and paved. The &quot;Valley of the Communities&quot; monument at Yad Vashem commemorates over 5,000 Jewish communities destroyed or damaged during the Holocaust, the names of which are engraved on its towering walls. The position of Yad Vashem is that the Holocaust is incomparable to any other calamity previously inflicted on the Jewish people, and therefore the Holocaust cannot be regarded as a continuation of the death and destruction that plagued Jewish communities over the centuries, but rather as a unique phase in history, an unprecedented endeavor to totally annihilate the Jewish people.

In 1982, Yad Vashem sponsored the International Conference on Holocaust and Genocide, which included six presentations on the Armenian genocide. It later withdrew from the conference after threats by the Turkish government that Jewish lives would be put in danger if the conference went ahead.

On 15 March 2005, a new Museum complex four times larger than the old one opened at Yad Vashem. It included the Holocaust History Museum with a new Hall of Names, a Museum of Holocaust Art, an Exhibitions Pavilion, a Learning Center and a Visual Center. The new Yad Vashem museum was designed by Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie, replacing the previous 30-year-old exhibition. It was the culmination of a $100 million decade-long expansion project.

==Administration==
In November 2008, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau was appointed chairman of Yad Vashem&#x27;s council, replacing Tommy Lapid. The vice chairman of the council is Moshe Kantor. Yitzhak Arad was vice chairman until his death on May 6, 2021. Elie Wiesel was vice chairman of the council until his death on 2 July 2016.

Yitzhak Arad served as the chairman of the directorate from 1972 to 1993. He was succeeded by Avner Shalev, who served as chairman until February 2021. Shalev was succeeded as chairman by Dani Dayan in August 2021.

The members of the Yad Vashem directorate are Yossi Ahimeir, Daniel Atar, Michal Cohen, Avraham Duvdevani, Boleslaw (Bolek) Goldman, Vera H. Golovensky, Shlomit Kasirer, Yossi Katribas, Yehiel Leket, Dalit Stauber, Zehava Tanne, Shoshana Weinshall, and Dudi Zilbershlag. Former deceased members were Matityahu Drobles, Moshe Ha-Elion and Baruch Shub.

The CEO is Tzvika Fayirizen. The Director of the International Institute for Holocaust Research is Iael Nidam-Orvieto. The chair for Holocaust studies is Dan Michman. and Prof. Dina Porat is Senior Academic Advisor. She also served as Chief Historian between the years 2011-2022. Prior to that Prof. Yehuda Bauer had that position.

==Objectives==
The aims of Yad Vashem are education, research and documentation, and commemoration. Yad Vashem organizes professional development courses for educators both in Israel and throughout the world; develops age-appropriate study programs, curricula, and educational materials for Israeli and foreign schools in order to teach students of all ages about the Holocaust; holds exhibitions about the Holocaust; collects the names of Holocaust victims; collects photos, documents, and personal artifacts; and collects Pages of Testimony memorializing victims of the Holocaust. Yad Vashem seeks to preserve the memory and names of the six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust, and the numerous Jewish communities destroyed during that time. It holds ceremonies of remembrance and commemoration; supports Holocaust research projects; develops and coordinates symposia, workshops, and international conferences; and publishes research, memoirs, documents, albums, and diaries related to the Holocaust. Yad Vashem also honors non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust.

The International Institute for Holocaust Studies at Yad Vashem, founded in 1993, offers guides and seminars for students, teachers, and educators, and develops pedagogic tools for use in the classroom. Yad Vashem trains thousands of domestic and foreign teachers every year.

Yad Vashem operates a web site in several languages, including English, German, Hebrew, Persian, French, Russian, Spanish and Arabic. In 2013 Yad Vashem launched an online campaign in Arabic, promoting Yad Vashem&#x27;s website. The campaign reached over 2.4 million Arabic speakers from around the globe, and the traffic to Yad Vashem&#x27;s website was tripled.

The institution&#x27;s policy is that the Holocaust &quot;cannot be compared to any other event&quot;. In 2009 Yad Vashem fired a docent for comparing the trauma Jews suffered in the Holocaust to the trauma Palestinians suffered during 1947–1949 Palestine war, including the Deir Yassin massacre.

===&quot;Yad Vashem Studies&quot;===

&quot;Yad Vashem Studies&quot; is a peer-reviewed semi-annual scholarly journal on the Holocaust. Published since 1957, it appears in both English and Hebrew editions.

==Museum==

Yad Vashem building on the Mount of Remembrance was inaugurated in 1957. Its first exhibits, opened on 1958, focused on documentation of the Holocaust. The second exhibition, opened in 1959, presented paintings from the Holocaust Ghettos and camps.

In 1993, planning began for a larger, more technologically advanced museum to replace the old one. The new building, designed by Canadian-Israeli architect Moshe Safdie, consists of a long corridor connected to 10 exhibition halls, each dedicated to a different chapter of the Holocaust. The museum combines the personal stories of 90 Holocaust victims and survivors and presents approximately 2,500 personal items including artwork and letters donated by survivors and others. The old historical displays revolving around anti-Semitism and the rise of Nazism have been replaced by exhibits that focus on the personal stories of Jews killed in the Holocaust. According to Avner Shalev, the museum&#x27;s curator and chairman, a visit to the new museum revolves around &quot;looking into the eyes of the individuals. There weren&#x27;t six million victims, there were six million individual murders.&quot;

The new museum was dedicated on 15 March 2005 in the presence of leaders from 40 states and then Secretary General of the UN Kofi Annan. President of Israel Moshe Katzav said that Yad Vashem serves as &quot;an important signpost to all of humankind, a signpost that warns how short the distance is between hatred and murder, between racism and genocide&quot;.

In April 2019, Yad Vashem started a new collection center to house and conserve millions of artifacts from the Holocaust.

==Architecture==

The first architect involved in the design of Yad Vashem was Munio Weinraub, who worked on the project from 1943 till the 1960s, together with his architectural partner Al Mansfield. He was approached for this purpose by Mordechai Shenhavi, the initiator and first director of the institution. Weinraub&#x27;s plans were not realised as a whole, but some of his ideas are visible in Yad Vashem today.

The new Holocaust History Museum, designed by Moshe Safdie, is shaped like a triangular concrete prism that cuts through the landscape, illuminated by a skylight. Visitors follow a preset route that takes them through underground galleries that branch off from the main hall. Safdie is also the architect behind the Children&#x27;s Memorial and the Deportees (cattle-car) Memorial.

The gates are the work of the sculptor David Palombo (1920–1966).

==Hall of Names==

The Hall of Names is a memorial to the six million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. The main hall is composed of two cones: one ten meters high, with a reciprocal well-like cone excavated into the underground rock, its base filled with water. On the upper cone is a display featuring 600 photographs of Holocaust victims and fragments of Pages of Testimony. These are reflected in the water at the bottom of the lower cone, commemorating those victims whose names remain unknown. Surrounding the platform is the circular repository, housing the approximately 2.7 million Pages of Testimony collected to date, with empty spaces for those yet to be submitted.

Since the 1950s, Yad Vashem has collected approximately 110,000 audio, video, and written testimonies by Holocaust survivors. As the survivors age, the program has expanded to visiting survivors in their homes, to tape interviews. Adjoining the hall is a study area with a computerized data bank where visitors can do online searches for the names of Holocaust victims.

==Archives==
The Archive is the oldest department of Yad Vashem. Before presenting an exhibition, Yad Vashem collects items. The best known of these are the historical photographs, as well as the Pages of Testimonies collected from survivors. The latter is a database of personal information about those who survived and those who were murdered in the Holocaust. Yad Vashem has also acquired access to the database of the International Tracing Service of Bad Arolsen of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and these two databases complement each other for research purposes.

==Righteous Among the Nations==

One of Yad Vashem&#x27;s tasks is to honor non-Jews who risked their lives, liberty, or positions to save Jews during the Holocaust. To this end, a special independent commission, headed by a retired Supreme Court justice, was established. The commission members, including historians, public figures, lawyers, and Holocaust survivors, examine and evaluate each case according to a well-defined set of criteria and regulations. The Righteous receive a certificate of honor and a medal, and their names are commemorated in the Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations, on the Mount of Remembrance, Yad Vashem. This is an ongoing project that will continue for as long as there are valid requests, substantiated by testimonies or documentation. Five hundred and fifty-five individuals were recognized during 2011, and , more than 27,921 individuals have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations.

Yad Vashem&#x27;s declared policy is not to provide meaningful recognition, even in a possible new category, to Jews who rescued Jews, regardless of the number of people their activism saved. The stated reason is that Jews had an obligation to save fellow Jews and do not deserve recognition.

== Controversies ==

=== Ładoś Group ===
In April 2019 the Yad Vashem granted the title of Righteous Among the Nations to Konstanty Rokicki and offered &quot;appreciation&quot; to Aleksander Ładoś and Stefan Ryniewicz arguing that Rokicki headed the Ładoś Group. The document erroneously called Ładoś and Ryniewicz &quot;consuls&quot;. The decision sparked outrage and frustration among the family members of the two other late Polish diplomats, and among survivors. Thirty one of them signed an open letter to Yad Vashem. Rokicki&#x27;s cousin refused to accept the medal until two other Polish diplomats, Rokicki&#x27;s superior are recognized as Righteous Among The Nations, too. Polish Ambassador to Switzerland Jakub Kumoch who contributed to the discovery of Rokicki also refuted the Yad Vashem&#x27;s interpretation stating that Rokicki worked under Ładoś and Ryniewicz. Eldad Beck of &quot;Israel Hayom&quot; suggested that this decision was politically inspired and related to the worsening of Israel-Poland relations due to the controversy over the Amendment to the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance.
===Political interference and leadership===
In 2018, Yad Vashem chief historian Dina Porat participated in developing an compromise agreement between the Israeli and Polish governments about Poland’s record during the Holocaust, and moderating a Polish law criminalizing any assertion of any Polish complicity in the Holocaust or other Nazi crimes. By agreement between the Israeli and Polish governments, the law was reworded to acknowledge some Polish misconduct, in exchange for a joint declaration by Polish government and Israeli Knesset that many Poles committed &quot;heroic&quot; efforts &quot;to save Jewish people.&quot; However, the museum, itself, argued the declaration &quot;contains highly problematic wording that contradicts existing and accepted historical knowledge in this field,&quot; and harshly disparaged the deal, saying the agreement would stifle free research about the subject.

In February 2020, Yad Vashem apologized for “inaccuracies” and “partial” facts that had been presented in Jerusalem at the previous month’s World Holocaust Forum (attended by Russian president Vladimir Putin and other world leaders). The criticism alleged the program excessively emphasized Russia’s role in ending World War II, and suppressed information unpalatable to Russia&#x27;s government.

In 2020 plans to appoint Effi Eitam to head the institutions have been criticized, due to alleged racist remarks made by the appointee.

In summer 2023, a number of scholars, politicians and media figures have criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Education Minister Yoav Kisch for an attempt to remove Yad Vashem Chairman Dani Dayan from his position, noting that this reduces the independence and hence, credibility, of the institution.

==Art gallery==
Yad Vashem houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of artwork produced by Jews and other victims of Nazi occupation in 1933–1945. The Yad Vashem Art Department supervises a 10,000-piece collection, adding 300 pieces a year, most of them donated by survivors&#x27; families or discovered in attics. Included in the collection are works by Alexander Bogen, Alice Lok Cahana, Samuel Bak, and Felix Nussbaum.

<doc id="181970" wikidata="Q504485" url="?curid=181970" title="Jack Teagarden">
<text>Weldon Leo &quot;Jack&quot; Teagarden (August 20, 1905 – January 15, 1964) was an American jazz trombonist and singer. Initially, he was a sideman for Paul Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra, and later for his lifelong friend Louis Armstrong, playing in Louis Armstrong&#x27;s All-Stars from 1946 to 1951.

==Early life==
Jack Teagarden was born in Vernon, Texas, United States, the oldest of four siblings. His first public performances were in movie theaters, with accompaniment from his mother, who was a pianist. His siblings also pursued professional musical careers, with Charlie playing trumpet, norma playing piano, and Clois (&quot;Cub&quot;) playing drums. 

Jack’s early exposure to music came from his family. His father Charles, worked in the oil fields and played the cornet part-time, while his mother Helen, was a semi-professional pianist. His mother taught music to all of her children and the family often played music together. These moments of family unity fostered his deep love for music. His father, an amateur brass band trumpeter, made him start with a baritone horn. Eight year old Jack received his first trombone as a Christmas gift, which made him transition from the tenor-valve horn he had previously mastered. He would &quot;fake&quot; notes beyond his reach due to his short arms, which would later define his unique trombone style.

Teagarden became the youngest member of the Paul Goetze Band at age of 11, where his improvisational tendencies often surprised his instructors. Jack faced challenges in his relationship with his father, whose struggles with the cornet contrasted with Jack’s rapid musical growth. Nevertheless, music remained a shared passion and helped to unite the family as it was recorded that they often played music together during their leisure time. 

==Music career==

During his early career, Jack played at venues like the Horn Palace in San Antonio, where he formed a close bond with clarinetist George Hill. The duo earned acclaim from both local patrons and fellow musicians. After his stint with Bailey’s band, Jack joined Peck Kelley’s ensemble, a group that included several of his close collaborators.

By 1920, Teagarden was playing professionally in San Antonio, including with the band of pianist Peck Kelley. Kelley’s mentorship and Jack’s innovative approach to trombone playing helped establish his reputation. His unique phrasing and improvisational skills soon made him a sought-after performer, setting the stage for his future collaborations with players like Louis Armstrong. In the mid-1920s, he traveled widely around the United States in a quick succession of different bands. In 1927, he came to New York City to work with several other bands. By 1928 he played for the Ben Pollack band. 

Teagarden’s early career included significant milestones such as joining Ben Pollack’s band in 1928, where he recorded over 300 tracks. Notably, he participated in one of the first integrated jazz recording sessions in 1929, a landmark event organized by Eddie Condon, that produced the track &quot;Knocking a Jug.&quot; Teagarden’s career continued with Paul Whiteman’s orchestra, though the band’s limited jazz repertoire prompted him to leave after a five-year contract. These early experiences solidified his reputation as one of the era’s leading jazz trombonists.

In the late 1920s, he recorded with such bandleaders and sidemen as Armstrong, Benny Goodman, Bix Beiderbecke, Red Nichols, Jimmy McPartland, Mezz Mezzrow, Glenn Miller, Eddie Condon, and Fats Waller. In 1931, Teagarden’s early orchestra recorded the tune “Chances Are” with Fats Waller playing piano and Jack singing and playing trombone. Miller and Teagarden collaborated to provide lyrics and a verse to Spencer Williams&#x27; &quot;Basin Street Blues,&quot; which became one of the numbers that Teagarden played most frequently.

Teagarden sought financial security during the Great Depression and signed an exclusive contract to play for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra from 1933 through 1938. In 1946, Teagarden joined Louis Armstrong&#x27;s All-Stars. Teagarden remained committed to jazz even as the genre underwent significant transformations. Critics noted his ability to inject fresh emotion and energy into classic jazz standards. 

Teagarden’s tenure with Louis Armstrong’s All-Stars was a significant moment in his career, showcasing his versatility as both a trombonist and vocalist. During this period, his relaxed, bluesy style complemented Armstrong’s high-energy performances, resulting in numerous collaborations such as their rendition of “Rockin’ Chair.” Despite the group’s demanding touring schedule, Teagarden thrived in this environment, often described as the happiest period of his professional life. In late 1951, Teagarden left to again lead his own band.

== Later Life and Death ==
Teagarden was found deceased in his hotel room in New Orleans on January 15, 1964, just hours before he was scheduled to perform. His death was later attributed to bronchial pneumonia. Teagarden’s death at the age of 58 brought an outpouring of tributes from musicians and fans, commemorating his contributions to the genre.

At the time of his death, Teagarden was actively touring around the country. The Los Angeles Times noted that Teagarden was widely regarded as a towering figure in jazz, celebrated for his innovations in trombone technique and his soulful, blues-inflected vocals.

== Style and Technique ==
Teagarden&#x27;s trombone style was largely self-taught, and he developed many unusual alternative positions and novel special effects on the instrument. He is usually considered the most innovative jazz trombone stylist of the pre-bebop era – Pee Wee Russell once called him &quot;the best trombone player in the world&quot;.

Jack Teagarden’s trombone playing was marked by a smoothness and fluidity that set him apart from other musicians of his era. Critics often praised his &quot;bluesy&quot; phrasing and ability to make the trombone sing in ways that emulated the human voice. His improvisational skill was unparalleled, allowing him to blend seamlessly into ensembles while maintaining a unique presence. Beyond his trombone mastery, Teagarden was celebrated as a jazz vocalist with a rich, emotive tone that added depth to his performances. His approach was deeply personal, eschewing rigid technique for a style that felt spontaneous and heartfelt.

Jack Teagarden’s trombone playing combined smooth, horizontal melodic phrasing with a distinctive use of vertical, arpeggiated lines. His improvisational style, particularly in performances like his 1953 solo on &quot;Lover,&quot; showcased a balance between technical prowess and melodic fluidity. Teagarden’s approach often involved juxtaposing scalar runs with chromatic arpeggios, creating harmonically rich improvisations that remained firmly rooted in the song’s structure. His playing rejected the traditional slide techniques of early jazz trombonists in favor of lip flexibility and embouchure control, allowing for seamless, legato phrasing. Critics have highlighted his ability to maintain a warm, vocal-like tone throughout his performances, making even complex passages sound effortless.

== Legacy ==
Jack Teagarden was celebrated for his global reach, performing for diverse audiences that included royal families in Cambodia and Thailand. His ability to connect with people across cultures made him vital in bringing jazz to the world stage. Despite the challenges of a musician’s life, including financial struggles during the Great Depression, Jack reflected on his career with pride, viewing the acceptance of jazz as one of the greatest cultural achievements of his time. 

He bridged the gap between traditional Dixieland and modern swing styles. Jazz historian Gunther Schuller described Teagarden as possessing “effortless sovereign technical mastery, richness of tone, and a total lack of exhibitionism,” qualities that distinguished him from his contemporaries. His influence is particularly evident in the work of later jazz trombonists, who have cited his melodic inventiveness and relaxed phrasing as major inspirations.

Teagarden’s unique contributions to jazz earned him widespread admiration from fellow musicians and critics. Trombonist Tommy Dorsey reportedly altered his own style to avoid comparisons to Teagarden’s playing, and Glenn Miller downplayed his trombone skills after working alongside Teagarden in Ben Pollack’s band. Jazz historian Gunther Schuller praised Teagarden’s unmatched ability to combine technical brilliance with emotional depth, cementing his legacy as one of the greatest jazz musicians of all time.

Teagarden’s death highlighted the sacrifices he made for his music, including a grueling tour schedule and personal health challenges. In the years following his passing, his recordings and performances were celebrated as touchstones of jazz history, ensuring that his legacy endured. Teagarden’s influence was further solidified through retrospective evaluations of his work. The Los Angeles Times highlighted his unique ability to elevate the trombone within jazz ensembles, carving out a role for the instrument as a lead voice rather than a supporting one. His recordings, including iconic collaborations with Louis Armstrong, remain celebrated examples of jazz excellence.

Following his death in 1964, Jack Teagarden was remembered not only for his musical innovations but also for his warm personality and generosity toward fellow musicians. He was often described as a gentle, unassuming figure who prioritized his artistry over personal gain. He was celebrated in numerous tributes and retrospectives, cementing his status as a cornerstone of jazz history.

<doc id="181973" wikidata="Q2080471" url="?curid=181973" title="Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln">
<text>Hugh of Lincoln (1246 – 27 August 1255) was an English boy whose death in Lincoln was falsely attributed to Jews. He is sometimes known as Little Saint Hugh or Little Sir Hugh to distinguish him from the adult saint, Hugh of Lincoln (died 1200). The boy Hugh was not formally canonised, so &quot;Little Saint Hugh&quot; is a misnomer.

Hugh became one of the best known of the blood libel &quot;saints&quot;: generally Christian children whose deaths were interpreted as Jewish human sacrifices. It is believed by some historians that the church authorities of Lincoln steered events in order to establish a profitable flow of pilgrims to the shrine of a martyr and saint. 

Hugh&#x27;s death is significant because it was the first time that the Crown gave credence to ritual child murder allegations, through the direct intervention of King Henry III. It was further bolstered by Matthew Paris&#x27; account of the events, and by Edward I&#x27;s support for the cult after his ordering of the expulsion of Jews from England, particularly his projection of power through the renovation of the tomb in the style of the Eleanor crosses. 

As a result, in contrast to other English blood libels, the story entered the historical record, medieval literature and in ballads that circulated until the twentieth century.

==Background==

Allegations of ritual child murder had become increasingly common following the circulation of &quot;The Life and Miracles of St William of Norwich&quot; by Thomas of Monmouth, the hagiography of William of Norwich, a child-saint said to have been crucified by Jews in 1144. Other accusations followed, such as that of Harold of Gloucester (1168) and Robert of Bury (1181). The story of William and similar rumours influenced the myth that developed around Hugh. The accusations may have been promoted by church officials hoping to establish local cults to attract pilgrims and donations.

During the years running up to the accusation, King Henry III taxed English Jews heavily. This in turn forced Jewish moneylenders to ensure their debts were paid, with no flexibility, or to sell their debt bonds to Christians. The King&#x27;s relatives and courtiers in particular would buy debt bonds, with the intention to seize the debtors&#x27; property as collateral. These policies of King Henry would later provoke the Second Barons&#x27; War.

Church restrictions against Jews also built up in the period. Pronouncements were made by the Vatican ordering that Jews live separate from Christians, that Christians were not to work for Jews, especially in their homes, and that Jews were to wear yellow badges to identify themselves. Church pronouncements in particular led to a number of English towns expelling their Jewish communities. Henry III codified most of the Church&#x27;s demands and put them into enforceable law in his 1253 Statute of Jewry.

At the time of the Hugh of Lincoln murder accusations, Henry III had sold his rights to tax English Jews to his brother, Richard, Earl of Cornwall. The King decreed that if any Jew were convicted of a crime, his money and property would then be forfeit to the Crown.

A number of Jews from across England had gathered in Lincoln to attend a wedding at the time of the child&#x27;s death.

==The accusation and myth==

The nine-year-old Hugh disappeared on 31 July, and his body was discovered in a well on 29 August. It was claimed that Jews had imprisoned Hugh, during which time they tortured and eventually crucified him. It was said that the body had been thrown into the well after attempts to bury it failed, when the earth had expelled it.

The chronicler Matthew Paris described the supposed murder, implicating all the Jews in England:

This year [1255] about the feast of the apostles Peter and Paul [27 July], the Jews of Lincoln stole a boy called Hugh, who was about eight years old. After shutting him up in a secret chamber, where they fed him on milk and other childish food, they sent to almost all the cities of England in which there were Jews, and summoned some of their sect from each city to be present at a sacrifice to take place at Lincoln, in contumely and insult of Jesus Christ. For, as they said, they had a boy concealed for the purpose of being crucified; so a great number of them assembled at Lincoln, and then they appointed a Jew of Lincoln judge, to take the place of Pilate, by whose sentence, and with the concurrence of all, the boy was subjected to various tortures. They scourged him till the blood flowed, they crowned him with thorns, mocked him, and spat upon him; each of them also pierced him with a knife, and they made him drink gall, and scoffed at him with blasphemous insults, and kept gnashing their teeth and calling him Jesus, the false prophet. And after tormenting him in diverse ways they crucified him, and pierced him to the heart with a spear. When the boy was dead, they took the body down from the cross, and for some reason disembowelled it; it is said for the purpose of their magic arts.
While the Paris account is significant as the most famous and influential version of the myth, due to his own popularity as a chronicler and talent as storyteller, it is also thought to be the least reliable, and most fabricated, of the contemporary accounts of what had supposedly taken place. Other contemporary accounts include the Annals of Waverley and of Burton Abbey.

===Role of the Bishop===
A Jew, Copin, reportedly confessed to the murder. He was also offered immunity from sentencing in return for his confession according to contemporary accounts. Copin appears to have been interrogated under torture by John of Lexington, brother of Henry, the new Bishop of Lincoln, and servant of the King. This leads to the conclusion by modern historians that there was likely clerical collusion to give credence to the accusation, with the aim of profiting from a new cult with pilgrims and their gifts.

===Royal intervention===
A number of circumstances exacerbated the impact of this event. Henry III arrived in Lincoln around a month after the initial arrest and confession. He ordered Copin to be executed, and for ninety Jews to be arrested at random in connection with Hugh&#x27;s disappearance and death and held in the Tower of London. They were charged with ritual murder. Eighteen of the Jews were hanged for refusing to participate in the proceedings, claiming this was a show trial and refusing to throw themselves on the mercy of a Christian jury. Gavin I. Langmuir says:

What distinguished the Lincoln affair from other accusations of ritual murder was that the king took personal cognizance and had one Jew executed immediately and eighteen others spectacularly executed later. That royal substantiation of the truth of the charge was probably decisive for Hugh&#x27;s fame, which far outshadowed that of William of Norwich, Harold of Gloucester, Robert of Bury St. Edmunds, and the poor anonymous infant of St. Paul&#x27;s.

Garcias Martini, knight of Toledo, interceded for the release of Benedict son of Moses of London, probably the father of Belaset, whose wedding had been taking place. In January a further pardon was extended to a Christian Jew, John, after the intervention of a Dominican friar. A trial took place on 3 February at Westminster for the remaining 71 prisoners. They were condemned to death by a jury of 48. After this point either the Dominicans or Franciscans interceded, together with Richard of Cornwall. By May, the prisoners were released. It may be that doubt as to their guilt had set in, as it is unlikely that the monks or Richard would have interceded without thinking the charge was false, given the severity of the charge.

The difficulty remains as to why King Henry and his servant John of Lexington would have believed the accusations in the first place. For Lexington, his motivations may be his personal connections to the clerics of Lincoln, including his brother the Bishop, who stood to benefit from the veneration of the &#x27;martyr&#x27; Hugh. He may have believed, or wished to believe, what he heard. While the decision to act belonged to the King, Langmuir believes that he was weak and easily manipulated by Lexington. Langmuir says Henry III has been described as; &quot;a suspicious person who flung charges of treason recklessly, [who] was credulous and poor in judgment, and often appeared like a petulant child. When to these qualities we add his addiction to touring the shrines of England, it becomes easier to understand why he acted as he did, both when he heard Copin&#x27;s confession and when the friars and cooler heads intervened later.&quot; Langmuir therefore concludes that Lexington &quot;incited the weakly credulous Henry III to give the ritual murder fantasy the blessing of royal authority&quot;. Jacobs on the other hand sees the financial benefits that Henry received as a major factor, conscious or unconscious, in his decision to arrest en masse and execute Jews. As noted above, he had mortgaged his income from the Jews to Richard of Cornwall, but was still entitled to the property of any Jew executed, adding that Henry, &quot;like most weak princes, was cruel to the Jews&quot;.

===Veneration===

After news spread of his death, miracles were attributed to Hugh; and he became one of the youngest individual candidates for sainthood, with 27 July unofficially made his feast day. Many local &#x27;saints&#x27; of the medieval period were not canonised but were locally dubbed saints and venerated. &#x27;Little Saint Hugh&#x27; was for a while acclaimed as a saint by local people but never officially recognised as one. Over time, the issue of the rush to sainthood was raised, and Hugh was never canonised and was never a part of the official Catholic calendar of saints. The Vatican never included the child Hugh in Catholic martyrology and his traditional English feast day is not celebrated.

Lincoln Cathedral benefited from the episode; Hugh was regarded as a Christian martyr, and sites associated with his life became objects of pilgrimage.

The shrine dated to the period immediately after the expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290, partly funded by Edward I, as a propaganda tool helping to justify his actions by emphasising the danger that Jews supposedly posed to Christians. The royal coat of arms was prominently displayed. As Stacey notes: &quot;A more explicit identification of the crown with the ritual crucifixion charge can hardly be imagined.&quot; The design included decoration commemorating Edward I&#x27;s wife Eleanor of Castile, who had been widely disliked for large-scale buying and selling of Jewish bonds, with the aim of requisitioning the lands and properties of those indebted; it may have deliberately echoed that of the Eleanor crosses, also commemorating her. This intervention was a major &quot;propaganda coup&quot; rehabilitating Edward and Eleanor&#x27;s image and claiming credit for the Expulsion.

While popular into the 1360s, the cult seems to have declined in the next half century, as it was raising just 10½d. in 1420–21. The shrine was largely destroyed after the English Reformation. During the Cathedral restoration of 1790 a stone coffin, 3 feet 3 inches (1 metre) long, was found containing the skeleton of a boy; this was drawn by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm.

==Legacy and significance==

The myth of ritual child murder was a continuing theme in anti-semitism and long-standing in English culture. The Hugh story is referenced by Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; in &quot;The Prioress&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Christopher Marlowe also apparently refers to the story in &quot;The Jew of Malta&quot;, where Friar Jacomo at the end of Act Three asks of a Jew, &quot;What, has he crucified a child?&quot; Again, Marlowe may have known the story through Paris&#x27;s account. The story is retold as fact in Thomas Fuller&#x27;s 1662 &quot;Worthies of England&quot;.

Ballads referring to the incident circulated in England, Scotland and France. The earliest English and French versions appear to have been composed near the time. The &quot;Sir Hugh&quot; ballad went through many variations, and was still well known into the nineteenth and twentieth century, when versions could be found in the United States.

Langmuir describes the fantasy concocted by Lexington as contributing to some of the darkest strands of anti-Jewish prejudice. Lexington:

inspired Matthew Paris to write a vivid garbled yarn that would ring in men&#x27;s minds for centuries and blind modern historians. A century and a half later, Geoffrey Chaucer, after letting the legend of the singing boy slip from the prioress&#x27;s lips, would inevitably be reminded of England&#x27;s most famous proof of Jewish evil and conclude with an invocation to young Hugh – whose alleged fate neither he nor his audience were likely to question. John de Lexinton died in January, 1257, and his elegant learning will not be described in any history of mediaeval thought, yet his tale of young Hugh of Lincoln became a strand in English literature and a support for irrational beliefs about Jews from 1255 to Auschwitz. It is time he received his due &#x27;credit&#x27; for such wickedness.

The Hugh myth continued to resonate into the nineteenth century, when European antisemitic polemicists attempted to &#x27;prove&#x27; the veracity of the story. In the twentieth century, a well in the former Jewish neighbourhood of Jews&#x27; Court, Lincoln was advertised as &#x27;the well in which Hugh&#x27;s body was found&#x27;, however this was found to have been constructed some time prior to 1928 to increase the tourist attraction of the property. A Lincolnshire preparatory school, St Hugh&#x27;s School, Woodhall Spa, was named after Little St Hugh in 1925; its school badge featured a ball travelling over a wall.

In 1955, the Church of England placed a plaque at the site of Little Hugh&#x27;s former shrine in Lincoln Cathedral, bearing these words:
By the remains of the shrine of &quot;Little St Hugh&quot;.

Trumped up stories of &quot;ritual murders&quot; of Christian boys by Jewish communities were common throughout Europe during the Middle Ages and even much later. These fictions cost many innocent Jews their lives. Lincoln had its own legend and the alleged victim was buried in the Cathedral in the year 1255.

Such stories do not redound to the credit of Christendom, and so we pray:

Lord, forgive what we have been,&lt;br&gt;
amend what we are,&lt;br&gt;
and direct what we shall be.

<doc id="181974" wikidata="Q612871" url="?curid=181974" title="Anusvara">
<text>Anusvara (, ), also known as Bindu (), is a symbol used in many Indic scripts to mark a type of nasal sound, typically transliterated or in standards like ISO 15919 and IAST. Depending on its location in the word and the language for which it is used, its exact pronunciation can vary. In the context of ancient Sanskrit, &quot;anusvara&quot; is the name of the particular nasal sound itself, regardless of written representation.

== Sanskrit ==
In Vedic Sanskrit, the anusvāra (lit. &quot;after-sound&quot; or &quot;subordinate sound&quot;) was an allophonic (derived) nasal sound.

The exact nature of the sound has been subject to debate. The material in the various ancient phonetic treatises points towards different phonetic interpretations, and these discrepancies have historically been attributed to either differences in the description of the same pronunciation or to dialectal or diachronic variation. In a 2013 reappraisal of the evidence, Cardona concludes that these reflect real dialectal differences.

The environments in which the anusvara could arise, however, were well defined. In the earliest Vedic Sanskrit, it was an allophone of /m/ at a morpheme boundary, or of /n/ within morphemes, when it was preceded by a vowel and followed by a fricative (). In later Sanskrit its use expanded to other contexts, first before /r/ under certain conditions, then, in Classical Sanskrit, before and .

Later still, Pāṇini gave anusvara as an alternative pronunciation as word-final sandhi, and later treatises also prescribed it at morpheme junctions and within morphemes. In the later written language, the diacritic used to represent anusvara was optionally used to indicate a nasal stop having the same place of articulation as a following plosive, which was written in some evolved scripts (e.g. in Bengali-Assamese) as an additional sandhi letter (no longer as a diacritic) for Vedic transcriptions of Sanskrit, to distinguish it with the anusvara diacritic that was used to transcribe other phonemes.

== Devanagari script ==
In the Devanagari script, anusvāra is represented with a dot (&quot;bindu&quot;) above the letter (e.g. मं). In the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST), the corresponding symbol is ṃ (&quot;m&quot; with an underdot). Some transcriptions render notation of phonetic variants used in some Vedic shakhas with variant transcription (ṁ).

In writing Sanskrit, the anusvara is often used as an alternative representation of the nasal stop with the same place of articulation as the following plosive. For example, &#x27;limb (of the body)&#x27; may be written with either a conjunct, अङ्ग &quot;aṅga&quot;, or with an anusvara, अंग &quot;aṃga&quot;. A variant of the anusvara, the anunāsika or &#x27;chandrabindu&#x27;, was used more explicitly for nasalized vowels, as in अँश &quot;aṃśa&quot; for &#x27;portion&#x27;.

=== Hindi ===
In Standard Hindi, the anusvāra is traditionally defined as representing a nasal consonant homorganic to a following plosive, in contrast to the (), which indicates vowel nasalization. In practice, however, the two are often used interchangeably.

The precise phonetic value of the phoneme, whether it is represented by or , is dependent on the phonological environment.

Word-finally, it is realized as nasalization of the preceding vowel: &#x27; , &quot;a well&quot;. It results in vowel nasalization also medially between a short vowel and a non-obstruent (&#x27; &quot;a youth&quot;, &#x27; &quot;a long-handled axe&quot;) and, in native words, between a long vowel and a voiceless plosive (&#x27; &quot;tooth&quot;, &#x27; &quot;a snake&quot;, &#x27; &quot;tail&quot;).

It is pronounced as a homorganic nasal, with the preceding vowel becoming nasalized allophonically, in the following cases: between a long vowel and a voiced plosive (&#x27; &quot;copper&quot;, &#x27; &quot;silver&quot;), between a long vowel and a voiceless plosive in loanwords (&#x27; &quot;repressed&quot;, &#x27; &quot;a bank&quot;, &#x27; &quot;cashier&quot;), and between a short vowel and an obstruent (&#x27; &quot;to support&quot;, &quot;&quot; &quot;a chest&quot;).

The last rule has two sets of exceptions in which the results only in the nasalization of the preceding short vowel. Words from the first set are morphologically derived from words with a long nasalized vowel (&#x27; , &quot;to be divided&quot; from &#x27; , &quot;to divide&quot;; &#x27; , &quot;irrigation&quot; from &#x27; , &quot;to irrigate&quot;). In such cases, the vowel is sometimes denasalized (, instead of , ). The second set is composed of a few words like &quot;(&quot; , &quot;to arrive&quot; and &#x27; , &quot;to laugh&quot;).

=== Marathi ===
In Marathi, the anusvāra is pronounced as a nasal that is homorganic to the following consonant (with the same place of articulation). For example, it is pronounced as the dental nasal न् before dental consonants, as the bilabial nasal म् before bilabial consonants, etc
. Unlike in other Indic languages, the same dot designating the anusvāra in Marathi is also used to mark a retension of the inherent vowel (it is inconsistently placed over a consonant after which the short central vowel is to be pronounced and not elided).

===Nepali===
In Nepali, the candrabindu indicates vowel nasalization. Therefore, there is a great deal of variation regarding which occurs in any given position. Many words containing anusvara thus have alternative spellings with a chandrabindu instead of the anusvāra and vice versa. Anusvara is used when there is too little space for the chandrabindu. The anusvāra can represent a nasal vowel, a homoorganic nasal, or both.

==Other Indic script languages==
Anusvara is used in other languages using Indic scripts as well, usually to represent suprasegmental phones (such as phonation type or nasalization) or other nasal sounds.

===Bengali===

In the Bengali script, the anusvara diacritic () is written as a circle above a slanted line (ং), and represents /ঙ্/. It is used in the name of the Bengali language বাংলা and has merged in pronunciation with the letter ঙ &quot;unga&quot; in Bengali.

Although the anusvara is a consonant in Bengali phonology, it is treated in the written system as a diacritic in that it is always directly adjacent to the preceding consonant, even when consonants are spaced apart in titles or banners: বাং-লা-দে-শ &quot;baṅ-la-de-ś&quot;, not বা-ং-লা-দে-শ &quot;ba-ṅ-la-de-ś&quot; for বাংলাদেশ &quot;Bangladesh&quot;. It is never pronounced with the inherent vowel &#x27;ô&#x27;, and it cannot take a vowel sign (instead, the consonant ঙ &quot;uṅô&quot; is used before vowels).

===Burmese===
In the Burmese script, the anusvara ( &quot;auk myit&quot; (့) ) is represented as a dot under a nasalised final to indicate a creaky tone (with a shortened vowel).

Burmese also uses a dot above a letter to indicate the nasalized ending (called &quot;Myanmar Sign Anusvara&quot; in Unicode), called &quot;thay thay tin&quot; () (ံ)

===Sinhala===
In the Sinhala script, the anusvara is not a nonspacing combining mark but a spacing combining mark. It has a circular shape and follows its base letter ( ං). It is called in Sinhala, which means &quot;dot&quot;. The anusvara represents at the end of a syllable. It is used in the name of the Sinhala language සිංහල . It has merged in pronunciation with the letter ඞ ṅa in Sinhala.

===Telugu===
The Telugu script has full-zero (sunna) ం , half-zero (arasunna) and &quot;visarga&quot; to convey various shades of nasal sounds. Anusvara is represented as a circle shape after a letter: క - ka and కం - kam.

===Thai===
The equivalent of the anusvara in the Thai alphabet is the &quot;nikkhahit&quot; (◌ํ). Used in rendering Sanskrit and Pali texts, it is written as an open circle above the consonant (for example ). Its pronunciation depends on the following sound: if it is a consonant, the nikkhahit is pronounced as a homorganic nasal, and if it is at the end of a word, it is pronounced as a voiced velar nasal.

==Anunasika==
Anunasika (&quot;&quot;) is a form of vowel nasalization, often represented by an anusvara. It is a form of open-mouthed nasalization, akin to the nasalization of vowels followed by &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; in Parisian French. When &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; follows a vowel, the &quot;n&quot; or &quot;m&quot; becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasal (it is pronounced with the soft palate extended downward to allow part or all of the air to leave through the nostrils). Anunasika is sometimes called a &quot;subdot&quot; because of its IAST representation.

In Devanagari and related scripts, the anunasika is represented by the chandrabindu diacritic (&quot;example&quot;: माँ).

In Burmese, the anunasika, called () and represented as , creates the nasalized ending when it is attached as a dot above a letter. The anunasika represents the -m final in Pali.

<doc id="181983" wikidata="Q1072904" url="?curid=181983" title="Fermi gas">
<text>A Fermi gas is an idealized model, an ensemble of many non-interacting fermions. Fermions are particles that obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, like electrons, protons, and neutrons, and, in general, particles with half-integer spin. These statistics determine the energy distribution of fermions in a Fermi gas in thermal equilibrium, and is characterized by their number density, temperature, and the set of available energy states. The model is named after the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi.

This physical model is useful for certain systems with many fermions. Some key examples are the behaviour of charge carriers in a metal, nucleons in an atomic nucleus, neutrons in a neutron star, and electrons in a white dwarf.

==Description==
An ideal Fermi gas or free Fermi gas is a physical model assuming a collection of non-interacting fermions in a constant potential well. Fermions are elementary or composite particles with half-integer spin, thus follow Fermi–Dirac statistics. The equivalent model for integer spin particles is called the Bose gas (an ensemble of non-interacting bosons). At low enough particle number density and high temperature, both the Fermi gas and the Bose gas behave like a classical ideal gas.

By the Pauli exclusion principle, no quantum state can be occupied by more than one fermion with an identical set of quantum numbers. Thus a non-interacting Fermi gas, unlike a Bose gas, concentrates a small number of particles per energy. Thus a Fermi gas is prohibited from condensing into a Bose–Einstein condensate, although weakly-interacting Fermi gases might form a Cooper pair and condensate (also known as BCS-BEC crossover regime). The total energy of the Fermi gas at absolute zero is larger than the sum of the single-particle ground states because the Pauli principle implies a sort of interaction or pressure that keeps fermions separated and moving. For this reason, the pressure of a Fermi gas is non-zero even at zero temperature, in contrast to that of a classical ideal gas. For example, this so-called degeneracy pressure stabilizes a neutron star (a Fermi gas of neutrons) or a white dwarf star (a Fermi gas of electrons) against the inward pull of gravity, which would ostensibly collapse the star into a black hole. Only when a star is sufficiently massive to overcome the degeneracy pressure can it collapse into a singularity.

It is possible to define a Fermi temperature below which the gas can be considered degenerate (its pressure derives almost exclusively from the Pauli principle). This temperature depends on the mass of the fermions and the density of energy states.

The main assumption of the free electron model to describe the delocalized electrons in a metal can be derived from the Fermi gas. Since interactions are neglected due to screening effect, the problem of treating the equilibrium properties and dynamics of an ideal Fermi gas reduces to the study of the behaviour of single independent particles. In these systems the Fermi temperature is generally many thousands of kelvins, so in human applications the electron gas can be considered degenerate. The maximum energy of the fermions at zero temperature is called the Fermi energy. The Fermi energy surface in reciprocal space is known as the Fermi surface.

The nearly free electron model adapts the Fermi gas model to consider the crystal structure of metals and semiconductors, where electrons in a crystal lattice are substituted by Bloch electrons with a corresponding crystal momentum. As such, periodic systems are still relatively tractable and the model forms the starting point for more advanced theories that deal with interactions, e.g. using the perturbation theory.

==1D uniform gas==
The one-dimensional infinite square well of length &quot;L&quot; is a model for a one-dimensional box with the potential energy:
formula_1

It is a standard model-system in quantum mechanics for which the solution for a single particle is well known. Since the potential inside the box is uniform, this model is referred to as 1D uniform gas, even though the actual number density profile of the gas can have nodes and anti-nodes when the total number of particles is small.

The levels are labelled by a single quantum number &quot;n&quot; and the energies are given by:

formula_2
where formula_3 is the zero-point energy (which can be chosen arbitrarily as a form of gauge fixing), formula_4 the mass of a single fermion, and formula_5 is the reduced Planck constant.

For &quot;N&quot; fermions with spin- in the box, no more than two particles can have the same energy, i.e., two particles can have the energy of formula_6, two other particles can have energy formula_7 and so forth. The two particles of the same energy have spin (spin up) or − (spin down), leading to two states for each energy level. In the configuration for which the total energy is lowest (the ground state), all the energy levels up to &quot;n&quot; = &quot;N&quot;/2 are occupied and all the higher levels are empty.

Defining the reference for the Fermi energy to be formula_3, the Fermi energy is therefore given by
formula_9
where formula_10 is the floor function evaluated at &quot;n&quot; = &quot;N&quot;/2.

=== Thermodynamic limit ===
In the thermodynamic limit, the total number of particles &quot;N&quot; are so large that the quantum number &quot;n&quot; may be treated as a continuous variable. In this case, the overall number density profile in the box is indeed uniform.

The number of quantum states in the range formula_11 is:
formula_12

Without loss of generality, the zero-point energy is chosen to be zero, with the following result:

formula_13

Therefore, in the range:
formula_14
the number of quantum states is:
formula_15

Here, the degree of degeneracy is:

formula_16

And the density of states is:

formula_17

In modern literature, the above formula_18 is sometimes also called the &quot;density of states&quot;. However, formula_19 differs from formula_18 by a factor of the system&#x27;s volume (which is formula_21 in this 1D case).

Based on the following formula:

formula_22

the Fermi energy in the thermodynamic limit can be calculated to be:

formula_23

==3D uniform gas==

The three-dimensional isotropic and non-relativistic uniform Fermi gas case is known as the &quot;Fermi sphere&quot;.

A three-dimensional infinite square well, (i.e. a cubical box that has a side length &quot;L&quot;) has the potential energy
formula_24

The states are now labelled by three quantum numbers &quot;n&quot;&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;&quot;y&quot;, and &quot;n&quot;&quot;z&quot;. The single particle energies are
formula_25
where &quot;n&quot;&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;&quot;y&quot;, &quot;n&quot;&quot;z&quot; are positive integers. In this case, multiple states have the same energy (known as degenerate energy levels), for example formula_26.

=== Thermodynamic limit ===
When the box contains &quot;N&quot; non-interacting fermions of spin-, it is interesting to calculate the energy in the thermodynamic limit, where &quot;N&quot; is so large that the quantum numbers &quot;n&quot;&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;&quot;y&quot;, &quot;n&quot;&quot;z&quot; can be treated as continuous variables.

With the vector formula_27, each quantum state corresponds to a point in &#x27;n-space&#x27; with energy
formula_28

With formula_29denoting the square of the usual Euclidean length formula_30.
The number of states with energy less than &quot;E&quot;F + &quot;E&quot;0 is equal to the number of states that lie within a sphere of radius formula_31 in the region of n-space where &quot;n&quot;&quot;x&quot;, &quot;n&quot;&quot;y&quot;, &quot;n&quot;&quot;z&quot; are positive. In the ground state this number equals the number of fermions in the system:

formula_32
The factor of two expresses the two spin states, and the factor of 1/8 expresses the fraction of the sphere that lies in the region where all &quot;n&quot; are positive.
formula_33
The Fermi energy is given by
formula_34

Which results in a relationship between the Fermi energy and the number of particles per volume (when &quot;L&quot;2 is replaced with &quot;V&quot;2/3):
: = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left( \frac{3 \pi^2 N}{V} \right)^{2/3} &lt;/math&gt;}}

This is also the energy of the highest-energy particle (the formula_35th particle), above the zero point energy formula_3. The formula_37th particle has an energy of
formula_38

The total energy of a Fermi sphere of formula_35 fermions (which occupy all formula_35 energy states within the Fermi sphere) is given by:

formula_41

Therefore, the average energy per particle is given by:
formula_42

=== Density of states ===

For the 3D uniform Fermi gas, with fermions of spin-, the number of particles as a function of the energy formula_43 is obtained by substituting the Fermi energy by a variable energy formula_44:

formula_45

from which the density of states (number of energy states per energy per volume) formula_19 can be obtained. It can be calculated by differentiating the number of particles with respect to the energy:

formula_47

This result provides an alternative way to calculate the total energy of a Fermi sphere of formula_35 fermions (which occupy all formula_35 energy states within the Fermi sphere):

formula_50

===Thermodynamic quantities===
====Degeneracy pressure====

By using the first law of thermodynamics, this internal energy can be expressed as a pressure, that is
formula_51
where this expression remains valid for temperatures much smaller than the Fermi temperature. This pressure is known as the degeneracy pressure. In this sense, systems composed of fermions are also referred as degenerate matter.

Standard stars avoid collapse by balancing thermal pressure (plasma and radiation) against gravitational forces. At the end of the star lifetime, when thermal processes are weaker, some stars may become white dwarfs, which are only sustained against gravity by electron degeneracy pressure. Using the Fermi gas as a model, it is possible to calculate the Chandrasekhar limit, i.e. the maximum mass any star may acquire (without significant thermally generated pressure) before collapsing into a black hole or a neutron star. The latter, is a star mainly composed of neutrons, where the collapse is also avoided by neutron degeneracy pressure.

For the case of metals, the electron degeneracy pressure contributes to the compressibility or bulk modulus of the material.

====Chemical potential====

Assuming that the concentration of fermions does not change with temperature, then the total chemical potential &quot;μ&quot; (Fermi level) of the three-dimensional ideal Fermi gas is related to the zero temperature Fermi energy &quot;E&quot;F by a Sommerfeld expansion (assuming formula_52):
formula_53
where &quot;T&quot; is the temperature.

Hence, the internal chemical potential, &quot;μ&quot;-&quot;E&quot;0, is approximately equal to the Fermi energy at temperatures that are much lower than the characteristic Fermi temperature &quot;T&quot;F. This characteristic temperature is on the order of 105 K for a metal, hence at room temperature (300 K), the Fermi energy and internal chemical potential are essentially equivalent.

===Typical values===

====Metals====
Under the free electron model, the electrons in a metal can be considered to form a uniform Fermi gas. The number density formula_54 of conduction electrons in metals ranges between approximately 1028 and 1029 electrons per m3, which is also the typical density of atoms in ordinary solid matter. This number density produces a Fermi energy of the order:
formula_55
where &quot;me&quot; is the electron rest mass. This Fermi energy corresponds to a Fermi temperature of the order of 106 kelvins, much higher than the temperature of the Sun&#x27;s surface. Any metal will boil before reaching this temperature under atmospheric pressure. Thus for any practical purpose, a metal can be considered as a Fermi gas at zero temperature as a first approximation (normal temperatures are small compared to &quot;T&quot;F).

====White dwarfs====
Stars known as white dwarfs have mass comparable to the Sun, but have about a hundredth of its radius. The high densities mean that the electrons are no longer bound to single nuclei and instead form a degenerate electron gas. The number density of electrons in a white dwarf is of the order of 1036 electrons/m3. This means their Fermi energy is:

formula_56

====Nucleus====
Another typical example is that of the particles in a nucleus of an atom. The radius of the nucleus is roughly:
formula_57
where &quot;A&quot; is the number of nucleons.

The number density of nucleons in a nucleus is therefore:

formula_58

This density must be divided by two, because the Fermi energy only applies to fermions of the same type. The presence of neutrons does not affect the Fermi energy of the protons in the nucleus, and vice versa.

The Fermi energy of a nucleus is approximately:
formula_59
where &quot;m&quot;p is the proton mass.

The radius of the nucleus admits deviations around the value mentioned above, so a typical value for the Fermi energy is usually given as 38 MeV.

== Arbitrary-dimensional uniform gas ==

=== Density of states ===
Using a volume integral on formula_60 dimensions, the density of states is:

formula_61

The Fermi energy is obtained by looking for the number density of particles:
formula_62

To get:
formula_63
where formula_64 is the corresponding &quot;d&quot;-dimensional volume, formula_65 is the dimension for the internal Hilbert space. For the case of spin-, every energy is twice-degenerate, so in this case formula_66.

A particular result is obtained for formula_67, where the density of states becomes a constant (does not depend on the energy):
formula_68

== Fermi gas in harmonic trap ==

The harmonic trap potential:

formula_69

is a model system with many applications in modern physics. The density of states (or more accurately, the degree of degeneracy) for a given spin species is:

formula_70

where formula_71 is the harmonic oscillation frequency.

The Fermi energy for a given spin species is:

formula_72

==Related Fermi quantities==
Related to the Fermi energy, a few useful quantities also occur often in modern literature.

The Fermi temperature is defined as formula_73, where formula_74 is the Boltzmann constant. The Fermi temperature can be thought of as the temperature at which thermal effects are comparable to quantum effects associated with Fermi statistics. The Fermi temperature for a metal is a couple of orders of magnitude above room temperature. Other quantities defined in this context are Fermi momentum formula_75, and Fermi velocity formula_76, which are the momentum and group velocity, respectively, of a fermion at the Fermi surface. The Fermi momentum can also be described as formula_77, where formula_78 is the radius of the Fermi sphere and is called the Fermi wave vector.

Note that these quantities are &quot;not&quot; well-defined in cases where the Fermi surface is non-spherical.

==Treatment at finite temperature==

===Grand canonical ensemble===
Most of the calculations above are exact at zero temperature, yet remain as good approximations for temperatures lower than the Fermi temperature. For other thermodynamics variables it is necessary to write a thermodynamic potential. For an ensemble of identical fermions, the best way to derive a potential is from the grand canonical ensemble with fixed temperature, volume and chemical potential &quot;μ&quot;. The reason is due to Pauli exclusion principle, as the occupation numbers of each quantum state are given by either 1 or 0 (either there is an electron occupying the state or not), so the (grand) partition function formula_79 can be written as
:formula_80
where formula_81, formula_82 indexes the ensembles of all possible microstates that give the same total energy formula_83 and number of particles formula_84, formula_85 is the single particle energy of the state formula_86 (it counts twice if the energy of the state is degenerate) and formula_87, its occupancy. Thus the grand potential is written as
:formula_88
The same result can be obtained in the canonical and microcanonical ensemble, as the result of every ensemble must give the same value at thermodynamic limit formula_89. The grand canonical ensemble is recommended here as it avoids the use of combinatorics and factorials.

As explored in previous sections, in the macroscopic limit we may use a continuous approximation (Thomas–Fermi approximation) to convert this sum to an integral:
formula_90
where is the total density of states.

===Relation to Fermi–Dirac distribution===
The grand potential is related to the number of particles at finite temperature in the following way
formula_91
where the derivative is taken at fixed temperature and volume, and it appears
formula_92
also known as the Fermi–Dirac distribution.

Similarly, the total internal energy is 
formula_93

===Exact solution for power-law density-of-states===
Many systems of interest have a total density of states with the power-law form:
formula_94
for some values of , , . The results of preceding sections generalize to dimensions, giving a power law with:
* for non-relativistic particles in a -dimensional box,
* for non-relativistic particles in a -dimensional harmonic potential well,
* for hyper-relativistic particles in a -dimensional box.
For such a power-law density of states, the grand potential integral evaluates exactly to:
formula_95
where formula_96 is the complete Fermi–Dirac integral (related to the polylogarithm). From this grand potential and its derivatives, all thermodynamic quantities of interest can be recovered.

==Extensions to the model==

===Relativistic Fermi gas===

The article has only treated the case in which particles have a parabolic relation between energy and momentum, as is the case in non-relativistic mechanics. For particles with energies close to their respective rest mass, the equations of special relativity are applicable. Where single-particle energy is given by:
formula_97

For this system, the Fermi energy is given by:
formula_98
where the formula_99 equality is only valid in the ultrarelativistic limit, and
formula_100

The relativistic Fermi gas model is also used for the description of massive white dwarfs which are close to the Chandrasekhar limit. For the ultrarelativistic case, the degeneracy pressure is proportional to formula_101.

===Fermi liquid===
In 1956, Lev Landau developed the Fermi liquid theory, where he treated the case of a Fermi liquid, i.e., a system with repulsive, not necessarily small, interactions between fermions. The theory shows that the thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas and a Fermi liquid do not differ that much. It can be shown that the Fermi liquid is equivalent to a Fermi gas composed of collective excitations or quasiparticles, each with a different effective mass and magnetic moment.

<text>Henry James &quot;Red&quot; Allen Jr. (January 7, 1908 – April 17, 1967) was an American jazz trumpeter and vocalist whose playing has been described by Joachim-Ernst Berendt and others as the first to fully incorporate the innovations of Louis Armstrong.

==Life and career==
Allen was born in the Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of the bandleader Henry Allen Sr. He took early trumpet lessons from Peter Bocage and Manuel Manetta.

Allen&#x27;s career began in Sidney Desvigne&#x27;s Southern Syncopators. He was playing professionally by 1924 with the Excelsior Brass Band and the jazz dance bands of Sam Morgan, George Lewis and John Casimir. After playing on riverboats on the Mississippi River, he went to Chicago in 1927 to join King Oliver&#x27;s band. Around this time he made recordings on the side in the band of Clarence Williams.

After returning briefly to New Orleans, where he worked with the bands of Fate Marable and Fats Pichon, he was offered a recording contract with Victor Records and went to New York City, where he joined the Luis Russell band, which was later fronted by Louis Armstrong in the late 1930s.

In 1929, Allen joined Luis Russell&#x27;s Orchestra, in which he was a featured soloist until 1932. He took part in recording sessions that year organized by Eddie Condon, some of which featured Fats Waller and Tommy Dorsey. He also made a series of recordings in late 1931 with Don Redman. In 1932 he recorded with the Rhythmakers in New York City. In 1933 he joined Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s Orchestra, in which he stayed until 1934. He played with Lucky Millinder&#x27;s Mills Blue Rhythm Band from 1934 to 1937, when he returned to Russell for three more years, by which time Russell&#x27;s orchestra was fronted by Louis Armstrong. Allen seldom received any solo space on recordings with Armstrong, but was prominently featured in the band&#x27;s live performances, even getting billing as a featured attraction.

As a bandleader, Allen recorded for Victor from 1929 through 1930. He made a series of recordings as co-leader with Coleman Hawkins in 1933 for ARC (Banner, Melotone, Oriole, Perfect, Romeo, etc.) and continued as an ARC recording artist through 1935, when he was moved to ARC&#x27;s Vocalion label for a popular series of swing records from 1935 through late 1937. A number of these were popular at the time. He did a solitary session for Decca in 1940 and two sessions for OKeh in 1941. After World War II, he recorded for Brunswick in 1944, Victor in 1946, and Apollo in 1947.

Allen continued making many recordings under his own name and also with Fats Waller and Jelly Roll Morton and accompanied such vocalists as Victoria Spivey and Billie Holiday. After a short stint with Benny Goodman, Allen began to lead his own band at the Famous Door in Manhattan. He then toured with the band around the United States into the late 1950s.

In December 1957, Allen appeared with Pee Wee Russell on the television program &quot;Sound Of Jazz&quot;. In 1959, he made his first tour of Europe when he joined Kid Ory&#x27;s band. He led the house band at New York&#x27;s Metropole Cafe from 1954, until the club ceased its jazz policy in 1965.

== Personal life and death ==
Allen was Catholic.

Allen returned to working under his own name and made numerous tours of the United States and Europe. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in late 1966. After undergoing surgery, he made a final tour of England, which ended six weeks before his death, on April 17, 1967, in New York City. He is buried, in the newer section of Saint Raymond&#x27;s Cemetery in the Bronx, in grave 52 of section 15. He was survived by his widow, Pearly May, and a son, Henry Allen III.

==Style and influence==
Allen&#x27;s trumpet style has been described by Joachim-Ernst Berendt and others as the first to fully incorporate the innovations of Louis Armstrong, and to develop an emphasis on phrasing. Allen&#x27;s recordings received much favorable attention. His versatility is shown by his winning of &quot;DownBeat&quot; awards in both the traditional jazz and the modern jazz categories.

In 2022, the New Orleans City Council voted to rename &quot;Slidell Street&quot; in Algiers to &quot;Red Allen Way&quot;, in his honor.

<text>Leroy Eldridge Cleaver (August 31, 1935 – May 1, 1998) was an American writer and political activist who became an early leader of the Black Panther Party.

In 1968, Cleaver wrote &quot;Soul on Ice&quot;, a collection of essays that, at the time of its publication, was praised by &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; as &quot;brilliant and revealing&quot;. Cleaver stated in &quot;Soul on Ice&quot;: &quot;If a man like Malcolm X could change and repudiate racism, if I myself and other former Muslims can change, if young whites can change, then there is hope for America.&quot;

Cleaver went on to become a prominent member of the Black Panthers, having the titles Minister of Information and Head of the International Section of the Panthers, while a fugitive from the United States criminal justice system in Cuba and Algeria. Cleaver was convicted of a series of crimes including burglary, assault, rape, and attempted murder and eventually served time in Folsom and San Quentin prisons until being released on parole in 1968. In 1968 he became a fugitive after leading an ambush on Oakland police officers, during which two officers were wounded. Cleaver was wounded during the clash and Black Panther member Bobby Hutton was killed. As editor of the official Panthers&#x27; newspaper, &quot;The Black Panther&quot;, Cleaver&#x27;s influence on the direction of the party was rivaled only by founders Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale. Cleaver and Newton eventually fell out with each other, resulting in a split that weakened the party.

After spending seven years in exile in Cuba, Algeria, and France, Cleaver returned to the U.S. in 1975, where he became involved in various religious groups (Unification Church and CARP) before joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as becoming a conservative Republican, appearing at Republican events.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Eldridge Cleaver was born in Wabbaseka, Arkansas. As a child he moved with his large family to Phoenix and then to Los Angeles. He was the son of Leroy Cleaver and Thelma Hattie Robinson. He had four siblings: Wilhelima Marie, Helen Grace, James Weldon, and Theophilus Henry. Both of his grandfathers were Protestant preachers.

As a teenager, he was involved in petty crime and spent time in youth detention centers. At the age of 18, he was convicted of a felony drug charge (marijuana) and sent to the adult prison at Soledad. In 1958, he was convicted of rape and assault with intent to murder, and served time in Folsom and San Quentin prisons. While in prison, he was given a copy of &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;.

Cleaver was released on parole December 12, 1966, with a discharge date of March 20, 1971. In 1968 he was arrested on violation of parole by association with individual(s) of bad reputation, and control and possession of firearms. Cleaver petitioned for habeas corpus to the Solano County Court, and was granted it along with a release of a $50,000 bail.

===Black Panther Party===

Cleaver was released from prison on December 12, 1966, with the help of Edward Michael Keating, founder of &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine. He was writing for &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine and organizing efforts to revitalize the Organization of Afro-American Unity. The Black Panther Party (BPP) was only two months old. He then joined the Oakland-based BPP, serving as Minister of Information, or spokesperson. What initially attracted Cleaver to the Panthers, as opposed to other prominent groups, was their commitment to armed struggle.

In 1967, Cleaver, along with Marvin X, Ed Bullins, and Ethna Wyatt, formed the Black House political/cultural center in San Francisco. Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Askia Toure, Sarah Webster Fabio, Art Ensemble of Chicago, Avotcja, Reginald Lockett, Emory Douglas, Samuel Napier, Bobby Hutton, Huey Newton, and Bobby Seale were Black House regulars. The same year, he married Kathleen Neal Cleaver (divorced 1987), with whom he would have son Ahmad Maceo Eldridge (born 1969, Algeria; died 2018, Saudi Arabia) and daughter Joju Younghi (born July 31, 1970, North Korea).
Cleaver was a presidential candidate in 1968 on the ticket of the Peace and Freedom Party. Having been born on August 31, 1935, Cleaver would not have been the requisite 35 years of age until more than a year after Inauguration Day 1969. (Although the Constitution requires that the president be at least 35 years of age, it does not specify whether he need have reached that age at the time of nomination, or election, or inauguration.) Courts in both Hawaii and New York held that he could be excluded from the ballot because he could not possibly meet the constitutional criteria.

In the aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, there were riots across the nation. On April 6, Cleaver and 14 other Panthers were involved in a confrontation with Oakland police officers, during which two of the officers were wounded. Cleaver was wounded during the ambush and 17-year-old Black Panthers member Bobby Hutton was killed. They were armed with M16 rifles and shotguns. In 1980, he claimed that he had led the Panther group on a deliberate ambush of the police officers, thus provoking the shootout.

Some reporters were surprised by this move, because it was in the context of an uncharacteristic speech in which Cleaver also discredited the Black Panthers, stating, &quot;we need police as heroes&quot;, and said that he denounced civilian review boards of police shootings for the &quot;bizarre&quot; reason that &quot;it is a rubber stamp for murder&quot;. Some speculated Cleaver&#x27;s admission could have been a pay-off to the Alameda County justice system, whose judge had only just days earlier let him avoid prison time; Cleaver was sentenced to community service after getting charged with three counts of assault against three Oakland police officers. The PBS documentary &quot;A Huey Newton Story&quot; claims that &quot;Bobby Hutton was shot more than twelve times after he had already surrendered and stripped down to his underwear to prove he was not armed.&quot;

Charged with attempted murder after the incident, Cleaver jumped bail to flee to Cuba in late 1968. Initially treated with hospitality by the Cuban government, this ended with reports that Fidel Castro had received information of the CIA infiltrating the Black Panther Party. Cleaver then decided to head to Algeria, sending word to his wife to meet him there. Elaine Klein normalized his status by getting him an invitation to attend the Pan-African Cultural festival, rendering him temporarily safe from prosecution.

The festival allowed him to network with revolutionaries from all over Africa in order to discuss the perils of white supremacy and colonialism. Cleaver was outspoken in his call to violence against the United States, contributing to his mission to &quot;position the Panthers within the revolutionary nationalist camp inside the United States and as disciples of Fanon on the world stage&quot;. Cleaver had set up an international office for the Black Panthers in Algeria. Following Timothy Leary&#x27;s Weather Underground-assisted prison escape, Leary stayed with Cleaver in Algiers; however, Cleaver placed Leary under &quot;revolutionary arrest&quot; as a counter-revolutionary for promoting drug use.

Cleaver cultivated an alliance with North Korea in 1969, and BPP publications began reprinting excerpts from Kim Il Sung&#x27;s writings. Although leftists of the time often looked to Cuba, China, and North Vietnam for inspiration, few had paid any attention to the secretive Pyongyang regime. Bypassing U.S. travel restrictions on North Korea, Cleaver and other BPP members made two visits to North Korea in 1969–1970 with the idea that the &quot;juche&quot; model could be adapted to the revolutionary liberation of African-Americans. Taken on an official tour of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, also known as North Korea, Cleaver expressed admiration at &quot;the DPRK&#x27;s stable, crime-free society which provided guaranteed food, employment, and housing for all, and which had no economic or social inequalities&quot;.

In the summer of 1970, Cleaver traveled to China as part a U.S. People&#x27;s Anti-Imperialist Delegation along with another prominent party member, Elaine Brown.

Byron Vaughn Booth (former Panther Deputy Minister of Defense) claimed that, after a trip to North Korea, Cleaver discovered that his wife had been having an affair with Clinton Robert Smith Jr., a fellow Black Panther. Booth told the FBI he had witnessed Cleaver shoot and kill Smith with an AK-47 in Algeria. Elaine Mokhtefi, in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, writes that Cleaver confessed the murder to her shortly after committing it.

In his 1978 book &quot;Soul on Fire&quot;, Cleaver made several claims regarding his exile in Algeria, including that he was supported by regular stipends from the government of North Vietnam, which the United States was then bombing. Cleaver stated that he was followed by other former criminals turned revolutionaries, many of whom (including Booth and Smith) hijacked planes to get to Algeria.

===Split and new directions===
Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton eventually had a disagreement over the necessity of armed struggle as a response to COINTELPRO and other actions by the government against the Black Panthers and other radical groups, which led to Cleaver&#x27;s eventual expulsion from the BPP. Also Cleaver&#x27;s interest in North Korea and global anti-imperialist struggle drew ire from other BPP members who felt that he was neglecting the needs of African-Americans at home in the U.S. Following his expulsion from the Black Panthers in 1971, the group&#x27;s ties with North Korea were quickly forgotten.

Cleaver advocated the escalation of armed resistance into urban guerrilla warfare, while Newton suggested the best way to respond was to put down the gun, which he felt alienated the Panthers from the rest of the black community, and focus on more pragmatic reformist activity by lobbying for increased social programs to aid African-American communities and anti-discrimination laws. Cleaver accused Newton of being an Uncle Tom for choosing to cooperate with white interests rather than overthrow them.

Cleaver left Algeria in 1972, moving to Paris, France, becoming a born again Christian during time in isolation living underground. He turned his hand to fashion design; three years later, he released codpiece-revival &quot;virility pants&quot; that he called &quot;the Cleavers&quot;, enthusing that they would give men &quot;a chance to assert their masculinity&quot;.
Cleaver returned to the United States in 1975 to face the unresolved attempted murder charge.

By September 1978, out on bail as the proceedings dragged on, he had incorporated Eldridge Cleaver Ltd, running a factory and West Hollywood shop exploiting his &quot;Cleavers&quot;, which he claimed liberated men from &quot;penis binding&quot;. He saw no conflict between this and his newfound Christianity, drawing support for his overtly sexual design from Deuteronomy 22. The long-outstanding charge was subsequently resolved on a plea bargain reducing it to assault. A sentence of 1,200 hours&#x27; community service was imposed.

===Later life===
In the early 1980s, Cleaver became disillusioned with what he saw as the commercial nature of evangelical Christianity and examined alternatives, including Sun Myung Moon&#x27;s campus ministry organization CARP. He was also Catholic for a time. He later led a short-lived revivalist ministry called Eldridge Cleaver Crusades, &quot;a hybrid synthesis of Islam and Christianity he called &#x27;Christlam&#x27;&quot;, along with an auxiliary called the &quot;Guardians of the Sperm&quot;.

Cleaver was then baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) on December 11, 1983. He periodically attended regular services and lectured by invitation at LDS gatherings.

By the 1980s, Cleaver had become a conservative Republican. He appeared at various Republican events and spoke at a California Republican State Central Committee meeting regarding his political transformation. In 1984, he ran for election to the Berkeley City Council but lost. Undaunted, he promoted his candidacy in the Republican Party primary for the 1986 Senate race but was again defeated. The next year, his 20-year marriage to Kathleen Neal Cleaver came to an end.

In 1988, Cleaver was placed on probation for burglary and was briefly jailed later in the year after testing positive for cocaine. He entered drug rehabilitation for a stated crack cocaine addiction two years later, but was arrested for possession by Oakland and Berkeley police in 1992 and 1994. Shortly after his final arrest, he moved to Southern California, falling into poor health.

===Death===
Cleaver died at age 62 on May 1, 1998, at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center in Pomona, California. He is buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena, California.

==&quot;Soul on Ice&quot; (1968)==
 
While in prison, he wrote a number of philosophical and political essays, first published in &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine and then in book form as &quot;Soul on Ice&quot;.

In the most controversial part of the book, Cleaver acknowledges committing acts of rape, stating that he initially raped black women in the ghetto &quot;for practice&quot; and then embarked on the serial rape of white women. He described these crimes as politically inspired, motivated by a genuine conviction that the rape of white women was &quot;an insurrectionary act&quot;. When he began writing &quot;Soul on Ice&quot;, he unequivocally renounced rape and all his previous reasoning about it.

The essays in &quot;Soul on Ice&quot; are divided into four thematic sections: &quot;Letters from Prison&quot;, describing Cleaver&#x27;s experiences with and thoughts on crime and prisons; &quot;Blood of the Beast&quot;, discussing race relations and promoting black liberation ideology; &quot;Prelude to Love – Three Letters&quot;, love letters written to Cleaver&#x27;s attorney, Beverly Axelrod; and &quot;White Woman, Black Man&quot;, on gender relations, black masculinity, and sexuality.

<text>Lee Ann Remick (; December 14, 1935 – July 2, 1991) was an American actress and singer. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for the film &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; (1962) and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her role in &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; (1966). She also earned seven Emmy Award nominations.

Remick made her film debut in &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957). Her other notable film roles include &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959), &quot;Wild River&quot; (1960), &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; (1962), &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot; (1968), &quot;The Detective&quot; (1968), &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Europeans&quot; (1979). 

She won Golden Globe Awards for the TV film &quot;The Blue Knight&quot; (1973), and for playing the title role in the miniseries &quot;&quot; (1974). For the latter role, she won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress. In April 1991, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Remick was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, the daughter of Gertrude Margaret (two sources say Patricia) (née Waldo), an actress, and Francis Edwin &quot;Frank&quot; Remick, who owned a department store. She had one older brother, Bruce. One of her maternal great-grandmothers, Eliza Duffield, was a preacher born in England.

Remick attended the Swoboda School of Dance and The Hewitt School.

==Career==
===Broadway and television===
Remick made her Broadway theatre debut, age 18, in the 1953 production &quot;Be Your Age&quot;. She began guest starring on episodes of TV anthology series such as &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

===Early films===
Remick made her film debut in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957). While filming the movie in Arkansas, Remick lived with a local family and practiced baton twirling so that she would be believable as the teenager who wins the attention of Lonesome Rhodes (played by Andy Griffith).

After appearing as Eula Varner, the hot-blooded daughter-in-law of Will Varner (Orson Welles) in &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot; (1958), she appeared in &quot;These Thousand Hills&quot; (1959) as a dance hall girl, both for 20th Century Fox.

===Film stardom===
Remick came to prominence portraying a rape victim whose husband is tried for killing her attacker in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959).

She made a second film with Kazan, &quot;Wild River&quot; (1960), which co-starred Montgomery Clift and Jo Van Fleet. That year she played Miranda in a television version of &quot;The Tempest&quot; with Richard Burton.

Remick was top-billed in &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1961) alongside Yves Montand. She appeared in &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1962) on television. She starred opposite Glenn Ford in the Blake Edwards suspense-thriller &quot;Experiment in Terror&quot; (1962). The same year, she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as the alcoholic wife of Jack Lemmon in &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; (1962), also directed by Edwards. Bette Davis, also nominated that year for &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;, said &quot;Miss Remick&#x27;s performance astonished me, and I thought, if I lose the Oscar, it will be to her.&quot; They both lost to Anne Bancroft in &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;.

When Marilyn Monroe was fired during the filming of the comedy &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot;, the studio announced that Remick would be her replacement. Co-star Dean Martin refused to continue, however, saying that while he admired Remick, he had signed on to the picture strictly to work with Monroe. Remick did &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1963) with Laurence Harvey and &quot;The Wheeler Dealers&quot; (1963), with James Garner.

===Return to Broadway and 1965 films===
Remick next appeared in the 1964 Broadway musical &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot;, with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book and direction by Arthur Laurents, which ran for only one week. Remick&#x27;s performance is captured on the original cast recording. This began a friendship between Remick and Sondheim, and she later appeared in the 1985 concert version of his musical &quot;Follies&quot;.

Remick returned to films with &quot;Baby the Rain Must Fall&quot; (1965), with Steve McQueen from a script by Horton Foote, and &quot;The Hallelujah Trail&quot; (1965) with Burt Lancaster.

In 1966, she starred in the Broadway play &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; under the direction of Arthur Penn and co-starring Robert Duvall. It was a big success, and it ran for 373 performances; Remick was nominated for a Tony award for Best Actress (Dramatic). It was adapted into a successful film the following year starring Audrey Hepburn.

===More films and 1970s===
She performed in &quot;Damn Yankees!&quot; (1967) for TV and starred in &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot; (1968) with Rod Steiger and George Segal, &quot;The Detective&quot; (1968) with Frank Sinatra, and &quot;Hard Contract&quot; (1969) with James Coburn.

Remick went to the UK to make &quot;Loot&quot; (1970) and &quot;A Severed Head&quot; (1971). Back in the U.S., she was in &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot; (1971). 

She appeared in &quot;Hennessy&quot; (1975), with Rod Steiger. She co-starred with Gregory Peck in the 1976 horror film &quot;The Omen&quot;. The film was a commercial success.

Remick followed it up with leading actress roles in &quot;Telefon&quot; (1977), with Charles Bronson; &quot;The Medusa Touch&quot; (1978) with Richard Burton; the television miniseries &quot;Wheels&quot; (1979) with Rock Hudson; &quot;&quot; (1979) portraying Kay Summersby; and &quot;The Europeans&quot; (1979) for director James Ivory.

Remick starred in many TV movies beginning with &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1972) with Orson Welles. She followed it with &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; (1972) for British TV; &quot;And No One Could Save Her&quot; (1973); &quot;Of Men and Women&quot; (1973), an unsuccessful pilot; &quot;The Blue Knight&quot; (1973) with William Holden; &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; (1973) with Katharine Hepburn; &quot;QB VII&quot; (1974); &quot;Touch Me Not&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;The Hunted&quot; (1974); &quot;&quot; (1975), playing the title role, which earned her an Emmy nomination; &quot;Hustling&quot; (1975) with Jill Clayburgh; &quot;A Girl Named Sooner&quot; (1975); &quot;Breaking Up&quot; (1978); and &quot;Torn Between Two Lovers&quot; (1979) with George Peppard.

===1980s===
Remick played Margaret Sullavan in &quot;Haywire&quot; (1980) and earned an Emmy nomination (as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Special). She had the lead in &quot;The Women&#x27;s Room&quot; (1980) and supporting roles in &quot;The Competition&quot; (1980) and &quot;Tribute&quot; (1980), the latter with Lemmon.

Remick starred in &quot;The Letter&quot; (1982), &quot;The Gift of Love: A Christmas Story&quot; (1983) and a TV adaptation of &quot;I Do! I Do!&quot; (1984). She had a role in the miniseries &quot;Mistral&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1984), adapted from the novel by Judith Krantz. The reviewer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Remick for portraying Kate &quot;to fresh-faced clawing perfection&quot;.

Remick was in &quot;Rearview Mirror&quot; (1984), &quot;Toughlove&quot; (1985), &quot;Of Pure Blood&quot; (1986), and &quot;&quot; (1987), earning another Emmy nomination (as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Special). She went to Australia to make &quot;Emma&#x27;s War&quot; (1987).

Remick&#x27;s later performances include &quot;The Vision&quot; (1987) with Dirk Bogarde, &quot;Jesse&quot; (1988), &quot;Bridge to Silence&quot; (1989) and playing Sarah Bernhardt in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1989). Her last performance was the lead in the TV movie &quot;Dark Holiday&quot; (1989).

==Recognition==
Remick was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award in 1990.

She has a star in the Motion Pictures section on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6104 Hollywood Boulevard. It was dedicated on April 29, 1991.

==Personal life==

Remick married producer Bill Colleran, whose credits include &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot; and &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot; on August 3, 1957. They had two children, Katherine Lee Colleran (b. January 27, 1959) and Matthew Remick Colleran (b. June 7, 1961). Remick and Colleran divorced in 1968.

Remick married British producer William Rory &quot;Kip&quot; Gowans on December 18, 1970. He was an assistant director on films such as &quot;Darling&quot; (1965), &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (1968) before they married, and afterward worked on &quot;Sleuth&quot; (1972), &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Human Factor&quot; (1979). She moved with Gowans to England and remained married to him until her death. She starred in four telefilms he produced, &quot;The Women&#x27;s Room&quot; (1980), &quot;The Letter&quot; (1982), &quot;Rearview Mirror&quot; (1984) and &quot;Of Pure Blood&quot; (1986). Remick and Gowans spent time in both England and Osterville, Massachusetts, which she considered her &quot;true home&quot;.

In the spring of 1989, Remick was diagnosed with kidney cancer. Treatments at first seemed to be successful. However, this proved not to be true, and she died on July 2, 1991, at the age of 55.

==Popular culture==
Remick was the subject of &quot;Lee Remick&quot;, the 1978 debut single by the Australian indie rock band The Go-Betweens.Remick was American-born and raised (as were her parents); after 1970, she divided her time between England (where she had family ancestry) and the U.S. 

The English indie rock band Hefner recorded a song titled &quot;Lee Remick&quot; in 1998, unrelated to the Go-Betweens&#x27; single.

<text>&lt;section begin=&quot;lede&quot;/&gt;The Gulf War was an armed conflict between Iraq and a 42-country coalition led by the United States. The coalition&#x27;s efforts against Iraq were carried out in two key phases: Operation Desert Shield, which marked the military buildup from August 1990 to January 1991; and Operation Desert Storm, which began with the aerial bombing campaign against Iraq on 17 January 1991 and came to a close with the American-led liberation of Kuwait on 28 February 1991.

On 2 August 1990, Iraq, governed by Saddam Hussein, invaded neighboring Kuwait and fully occupied the country within two days. The invasion was primarily over disputes regarding Kuwait&#x27;s alleged slant drilling in Iraq&#x27;s Rumaila oil field, as well as to cancel Iraq&#x27;s large debt to Kuwait from the recently ended Iran-Iraq War. After Iraq briefly occupied Kuwait under a rump puppet government known as the Republic of Kuwait, it split Kuwait&#x27;s sovereign territory into the Saddamiyat al-Mitla&#x27; District in the north, which was absorbed into Iraq&#x27;s existing Basra Governorate, and the Kuwait Governorate in the south, which became Iraq&#x27;s 19th governorate. 

The invasion of Kuwait was met with immediate international condemnation, including the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 660, which demanded Iraq&#x27;s immediate withdrawal from Kuwait, and the imposition of comprehensive international sanctions against Iraq with the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 661. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. president George H. W. Bush deployed troops and equipment into Saudi Arabia and urged other countries to send their own forces. Many countries joined the American-led coalition forming the largest military alliance since World War II. The bulk of the coalition&#x27;s military power was from the United States, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and Egypt as the largest lead-up contributors, in that order. 

United Nations Security Council Resolution 678, adopted on 29 November 1990, gave Iraq an ultimatum, expiring on 15 January 1991, to implement Resolution 660 and withdraw from Kuwait, with member-states empowered to use &quot;all necessary means&quot; to force Iraq&#x27;s compliance. Initial efforts to dislodge the Iraqis from Kuwait began with aerial and naval bombardment of Iraq on 17 January, which continued for five weeks. As the Iraqi military struggled against the coalition attacks, Iraq fired missiles at Israel to provoke an Israeli military response, with the expectation that such a response would lead to the withdrawal of several Muslim-majority countries from the coalition. The provocation was unsuccessful; Israel did not retaliate and Iraq continued to remain at odds with most Muslim-majority countries. Iraqi missile barrages against coalition targets in Saudi Arabia were also largely unsuccessful, and on 24 February 1991, the coalition launched a major ground assault into Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. The offensive was a decisive victory for the coalition, who liberated Kuwait and promptly began to advance past the Iraq–Kuwait border into Iraqi territory. A hundred hours after the beginning of the ground campaign, the coalition ceased its advance into Iraq and declared a ceasefire. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas straddling the Iraq–Saudi Arabia border.

The conflict marked the introduction of live news broadcasts from the front lines of the battle, principally by the American network CNN. It has also earned the nickname &quot;Video Game War&quot;, after the daily broadcast of images from cameras onboard American military aircraft during Operation Desert Storm. The Gulf War has also gained fame for some of the largest tank battles in American military history: the Battle of Medina Ridge, the Battle of Norfolk, and the Battle of 73 Easting.&lt;section end=&quot;lede&quot;/&gt;

==Names==
The war is also known under other names, such as the Second Gulf War (not to be confused with the 2003 Iraq War, also referred to as such), Persian Gulf War, Kuwait War, First Iraq War, or Iraq War before the term &quot;Iraq War&quot; became identified with the 2003 Iraq War (also known in the US as &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot;). The war was named (&quot;mother of all battles&quot;) by Iraqi officials. After the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Gulf War of 1990–1991 is often known as the &quot;First Iraq War&quot;.

The following names have been used to describe the conflict itself:
&quot;Gulf War&quot; and &quot;Persian Gulf War&quot; are the most common terms for the conflict used within western countries, though it may also be called the &quot;First Gulf War&quot; (to distinguish it from the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent Iraq War). Some authors have called it the &quot;Second Gulf War&quot; to distinguish it from the Iran–Iraq War. &quot;Liberation of Kuwait&quot; () (&quot;taḥrīr al-kuwayt&quot;) is the term used by Kuwait and most of the coalition&#x27;s Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates. Terms in other languages include and (&quot;War of Kuwait&quot;); (&quot;Gulf War&quot;) and (&quot;Second Gulf War&quot;).

===Operational names===
Most of the coalition states used various names for their operations and the war&#x27;s operational phases. These are sometimes incorrectly used as the conflict&#x27;s overall name, especially the US &quot;Desert Storm&quot;:
* &quot;Operation Desert Shield&quot; was the US operational name for the US buildup of forces and Saudi Arabia&#x27;s defense from 2 August 1990 to 16 January 1991
* &quot;Operation Desert Storm&quot; was the US name of the airland conflict from 17 January 1991 through 28 February 1991
** &quot;Operation Desert Sabre&quot; (early name &quot;Operation Desert Sword&quot;) was the US name for the air and land offensive against the Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (the &quot;100-hour war&quot;) from 24 to 28 February 1991, in itself, part of &quot;Operation Desert Storm&quot;
* Operation Desert Farewell was the name given to the return of US units and equipment to the US in 1991 after Kuwait&#x27;s liberation, sometimes referred to as &quot;Operation Desert Calm&quot;
* Operativo Alfil was the Argentine name for Argentine military activities
* Opération Daguet was the French name for French military activities in the conflict
* Operation Friction was the name of the Canadian operations
* Operation Granby was the British name for British military activities during the operations and conflict
* Operazione Locusta (Italian for Locust) was the Italian name for the operations and conflict

===Campaign names===
The US divided the conflict into three major campaigns:
* &quot;Defense of Saudi Arabian country&quot; for the period 2 August 1990, through 16 January 1991
* &quot;Liberation and Defense of Kuwait&quot; for the period 17 January 1991, through 11 April 1991
* &quot;Southwest Asia Cease-Fire&quot; for the period 12 April 1991, through 30 November 1995, including Operation Provide Comfort

==Background==
Throughout the Cold War, Iraq had been an ally of the Soviet Union, and there was a history of friction between Iraq and the United States. The US was concerned with Iraq&#x27;s position on Israeli–Palestinian politics. The US also disliked Iraqi support for Palestinian militant groups, which led to Iraq&#x27;s inclusion on the developing US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism in December 1979.

The US remained officially neutral after Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Iran in 1980, which became the Iran–Iraq War, although it provided resources, political support, and some &quot;non-military&quot; aircraft to Iraq. In March 1982, Iran began a successful counteroffensive (Operation Undeniable Victory), and the US increased its support for Iraq to prevent Iran from forcing a surrender. In a US bid to open full diplomatic relations with Iraq, the country was removed from the US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Ostensibly, this was because of improvement in the regime&#x27;s record, although former US Assistant Defense Secretary Noel Koch later stated: &quot;No one had any doubts about [the Iraqis&#x27;] continued involvement in terrorism ... The real reason was to help them succeed in the war against Iran.&quot;

With Iraq&#x27;s newfound success in the war, and the Iranian rebuff of a peace offer in July, arms sales to Iraq reached a record spike in 1982. When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein expelled Abu Nidal to Syria at the US&#x27;s request in November 1983, the Reagan administration sent Donald Rumsfeld to meet Saddam as a special envoy and to cultivate ties. By the time the ceasefire with Iran was signed in August 1988, Iraq was heavily debt-ridden and tensions within society were rising. Most of its debt was owed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Iraq&#x27;s debts to Kuwait amounted to $14 billion. Iraq pressured both nations to forgive the debts, but they refused.

The Iraq–Kuwait border dispute involved Iraqi claims to Kuwaiti territory. Kuwait had been a part of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s province of Basra, something that Iraq claimed made Kuwait rightful Iraqi territory. Kuwait&#x27;s ruling dynasty, the al-Sabah family, had concluded a protectorate agreement in 1899 that assigned responsibility for Kuwait&#x27;s foreign affairs to the United Kingdom. The UK drew the border between Kuwait and Iraq in 1922, making Iraq almost entirely landlocked. Kuwait rejected Iraqi attempts to secure further provisions in the region.

Iraq also accused Kuwait of exceeding its OPEC quotas for oil production. In order for the cartel to maintain its desired price of $18 per barrel, discipline was required. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were consistently overproducing; the latter at least in part to repair losses caused by Iranian attacks in the Iran–Iraq War and to pay for the losses of an economic scandal. The result was a slump in the oil priceas low as with a resulting loss of $7 billion a year to Iraq, equal to its 1989 balance of payments deficit. Resulting revenues struggled to support the government&#x27;s basic costs, let alone repair Iraq&#x27;s damaged infrastructure. Jordan and Iraq both looked for more discipline, with little success. The Iraqi government described it as a form of economic warfare, which it claimed was aggravated by Kuwait slant-drilling across the border into Iraq&#x27;s Rumaila oil field. According to oil workers in the area, Iraq&#x27;s slant drilling claim was fabricated, as &quot;oil flows easily from the Rumaila field without any need for these techniques.&quot; At the same time, Saddam looked for closer ties with those Arab states that had supported Iraq in the war. This move was supported by the US, who believed that Iraqi ties with pro-Western Gulf states would help bring and maintain Iraq inside the US&#x27; sphere of influence.

In 1989, it appeared that Saudi–Iraqi relations, strong during the war, would be maintained. A pact of non-interference and non-aggression was signed between the countries, followed by a Kuwaiti-Iraqi deal for Iraq to supply Kuwait with water for drinking and irrigation, although a request for Kuwait to lease Iraq Umm Qasr was rejected. Saudi-backed development projects were hampered by Iraq&#x27;s large debts, even with the demobilization of 200,000 soldiers. Iraq also looked to increase arms production so as to become an exporter, although the success of these projects was also restrained by Iraq&#x27;s obligations; in Iraq, resentment to OPEC&#x27;s controls mounted.

Iraq&#x27;s relations with its Arab neighbors, particularly Egypt, were degraded by mounting violence in Iraq against expatriate groups, who were well-employed during the war, by unemployed Iraqis, among them demobilized soldiers. These events drew little notice outside the Arab world because of fast-moving events directly related to the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. However, the US did begin to condemn Iraq&#x27;s human rights record, including the well-known use of torture. The UK also condemned the execution of Farzad Bazoft, a journalist working for the British newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot;. Following Saddam&#x27;s declaration that &quot;binary chemical weapons&quot; would be used on Israel if it used military force against Iraq, Washington halted part of its funding. A UN mission to the Israeli-occupied territories, where riots had resulted in Palestinian deaths, was vetoed by the US, making Iraq deeply skeptical of US foreign policy aims in the region, combined with the reliance of the US on Middle Eastern energy reserves.

In early July 1990, Iraq complained about Kuwait&#x27;s behavior, such as not respecting their quota, and openly threatened to take military action. On the 23rd, the CIA reported that Iraq had moved 30,000 troops to the Iraq-Kuwait border, and the US naval fleet in the Persian Gulf was placed on alert. Saddam believed an anti-Iraq conspiracy was developingKuwait had begun talks with Iran, and Iraq&#x27;s rival Syria had arranged a visit to Egypt. On 15 July 1990, Saddam&#x27;s government laid out its combined objections to the Arab League, including that policy moves were costing Iraq $1 billion a year, that Kuwait was still using the Rumaila oil field, and that loans made by the UAE and Kuwait could not be considered debts to its &quot;Arab brothers&quot;. He threatened force against Kuwait and the UAE, saying: &quot;The policies of some Arab rulers are American ... They are inspired by America to undermine Arab interests and security.&quot; The US sent aerial refuelling planes and combat ships to the Persian Gulf in response to these threats. Discussions in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, mediated on the Arab League&#x27;s behalf by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, were held on 31 July and led Mubarak to believe that a peaceful course could be established.

During Saddam Hussein&#x27;s 2003–2004 interrogation following his capture he claimed that in addition to economic disputes, an insulting exchange between the Kuwaiti emir Al Sabah and the Iraqi foreign minister – during which the emir stated his intention to turn &quot;every Iraqi woman into a $10 prostitute&quot; by bankrupting the country – was a decisive factor in triggering the Iraqi invasion.

On the 25th, Saddam met with April Glaspie, the US Ambassador to Iraq, in Baghdad. The Iraqi leader attacked American policy with regards to Kuwait and the UAE:

Glaspie replied:

Saddam stated that he would attempt last-ditch negotiations with the Kuwaitis but Iraq &quot;would not accept death.&quot;

According to Glaspie&#x27;s own account, she stated in reference to the precise border between Kuwait and Iraq, &quot;... that she had served in Kuwait 20 years before; &#x27;then, as now, we took no position on these Arab affairs&#x27;.&quot; Glaspie similarly believed that war was not imminent.

On 26 July 1990, only a few days before the Iraqi invasion, OPEC officials said that Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates had agreed to a proposal to limit their oil output to per day, &quot;down from the nearly 2 million barrels a day they had each been pumping,&quot; thus potentially settling differences over oil policy between Kuwait and Iraq.

==Invasion of Kuwait==


The result of the Jeddah talks was an Iraqi demand for $10 billion to cover the lost revenues from Rumaila; Kuwait offered $500 million. The Iraqi response was to immediately order an invasion, which started on 2 August 1990 with the bombing of Kuwait&#x27;s capital, Kuwait City.

Before the invasion, the Kuwaiti military was believed to have numbered 16,000 men, arranged into three armored, one mechanized infantry and one under-strength artillery brigade. The pre-war strength of the Kuwait Air Force was around 2,200 Kuwaiti personnel, with 80 fixed-wing aircraft and 40 helicopters. In spite of Iraqi saber rattling, Kuwait did not mobilize its force; the army had been stood-down on 19 July, and during the Iraqi invasion many Kuwaiti military personnel were on leave.

By 1988, at the end of the Iran–Iraq war, the Iraqi Army was the world&#x27;s fourth largest army, consisting of 955,000 standing soldiers and 650,000 paramilitary forces in the Popular Army. According to John Childs and André Corvisier, a low estimate shows the Iraqi Army capable of fielding 4,500 tanks, 484 combat aircraft and 232 combat helicopters. According to Michael Knights, a high estimate shows the Iraqi Army capable of fielding one million troops and 850,000 reservists, 5,500 tanks, 3,000 artillery pieces, 700 combat aircraft and helicopters; it held 53 divisions, 20 special-forces brigades, and several regional militias, and had a strong air defense.
Iraqi commandos infiltrated the Kuwaiti border first to prepare for the major units, which began the attack at midnight. The Iraqi attack had two prongs, with the primary attack force driving south straight for Kuwait City down the main highway, and a supporting attack force entering Kuwait farther west, but then turning and driving east, cutting off Kuwait City from the country&#x27;s southern half. The commander of a Kuwaiti armored battalion, 35th Armoured Brigade, deployed them against the Iraqi attack and conducted a robust defense at the Battle of the Bridges near Al Jahra, west of Kuwait City.

Kuwaiti aircraft scrambled to meet the invading force, but approximately 20% were lost or captured. A few combat sorties were flown against Iraqi ground forces.

The main Iraqi thrust into Kuwait City was conducted by commandos deployed by helicopters and boats to attack the city from the sea, while other divisions seized the airports and two airbases. The Iraqis attacked the Dasman Palace, the Royal Residence of Kuwait&#x27;s Emir, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, which was defended by the Emiri Guard supported with M-84 tanks. In the process, the Iraqis killed Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Emir&#x27;s youngest brother.

Within 12 hours, most resistance had ended within Kuwait, and the royal family had fled, allowing Iraq to control most of Kuwait. After two days of intense combat, most of the Kuwaiti military were either overrun by the Iraqi Republican Guard, or had escaped to Saudi Arabia. The Emir and key ministers fled south along the highway for refuge in Saudi Arabia. Iraqi ground forces consolidated their control of Kuwait City, then headed south and redeployed along the Saudi border. After the decisive Iraqi victory, Saddam initially installed a puppet regime known as the &quot;Provisional Government of Free Kuwait&quot; before installing his cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid as Kuwait&#x27;s governor on 8 August.
After the invasion, the Iraqi military looted over $1 billion in banknotes from Kuwait&#x27;s Central Bank. At the same time, Saddam Hussein made the Kuwaiti dinar equal to the Iraqi dinar, thereby lowering the Kuwaiti currency to one-twelfth of its original value. In response, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah ruled the banknotes as invalid and refused to reimburse stolen notes, which became worthless because of a UN embargo. After the conflict ended, many of the stolen banknotes made their way back into circulation. The stolen banknotes are a collectible for numismatists.

===Kuwaiti resistance movement===
Kuwaitis founded a local armed resistance movement following the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. The casualty rate far exceeded that of the coalition military forces and Western hostages. The resistance predominantly consisted of ordinary citizens who lacked any form of training and supervision.

==Run-up to the war==
===Diplomatic means===
A key element of US political, military and energy economic planning occurred in early 1984. The Iran–Iraq war had been going on for five years by that time and both sides sustained significant casualties, reaching into the hundreds of thousands. Within President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s National Security Council concern was growing that the war could spread beyond the boundaries of the two belligerents. A National Security Planning Group meeting was formed, chaired by then Vice President George H. W. Bush, to review US options. It was determined that the conflict would likely spread into Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states, but that the United States had little capability to defend the region. Furthermore, it was determined that a prolonged war in the region would induce much higher oil prices and threaten the fragile recovery of the world economy, which was just beginning to gain momentum. On 22 May 1984, President Reagan was briefed on the project conclusions in the Oval Office by William Flynn Martin who had served as the head of the NSC staff that organized the study. (The full declassified presentation can be seen here:) The conclusions were threefold: first, oil stocks needed to be increased among members of the International Energy Agency and, if necessary, released early if the oil market was disrupted; second, the United States needed to beef up the security of friendly Arab states in the region; and third, an embargo should be placed on sales of military equipment to Iran and Iraq. The plan was approved by President Reagan and later affirmed by the G7 leaders headed by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in the London Summit of 1984. The plan was implemented and became the basis for US preparedness to respond to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1991.

Within hours of the invasion, Kuwait and US delegations requested a meeting of the UN Security Council, which passed Resolution 660, condemning the invasion and demanding a withdrawal of Iraqi troops. On 3 August 1990, the Arab League passed its own resolution, which called for a solution to the conflict from within the league, and warned against outside intervention. Iraq and Libya were the only two Arab League states that opposed the resolution for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait; the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) opposed it as well. The Arab states of Yemen and Jordana Western ally which bordered Iraq and relied on the country for economic supportopposed military intervention from non-Arab states. Separately, Sudan, also an Arab League member, aligned itself with Saddam.

On 6 August, Resolution 661 placed economic sanctions on Iraq. Resolution 665 followed soon after, which authorized a naval blockade to enforce the sanctions. It said the &quot;use of measures commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be necessary ... to halt all inward and outward maritime shipping in order to inspect and verify their cargoes and destinations and to ensure strict implementation of resolution 661.&quot;

The US administration had at first been indecisive with an &quot;undertone ... of resignation to the invasion and even adaptation to it as a fait accompli&quot; until the UK&#x27;s prime minister Margaret Thatcher played a powerful role, reminding the President that appeasement in the 1930s had led to war, that Saddam would have the whole Gulf at his mercy along with 65 percent of the world&#x27;s oil supply, and famously urging President Bush &quot;not to go wobbly&quot;.

Once persuaded, US officials insisted on a total Iraqi pullout from Kuwait, without any linkage to other Middle Eastern problems, accepting the British view that any concessions would strengthen Iraqi influence in the region for years to come.

On 12 August 1990, Saddam &quot;propose[d] that all cases of occupation, and those cases that have been portrayed as occupation, in the region, be resolved simultaneously&quot;. Specifically, he called for Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, Syria to withdraw from Lebanon, and &quot;mutual withdrawals by Iraq and Iran and arrangement for the situation in Kuwait.&quot; He also called for a replacement of US troops that mobilized in Saudi Arabia in response to Kuwait&#x27;s invasion with &quot;an Arab force&quot;, as long as that force did not involve Egypt. Additionally, he requested an &quot;immediate freeze of all boycott and siege decisions&quot; and a general normalization of relations with Iraq. From the beginning of the crisis, President Bush was strongly opposed to any &quot;linkage&quot; between Iraq&#x27;s occupation of Kuwait and the Palestinian issue.

On 23 August, Saddam appeared on state television with Western hostages to whom he had refused exit visas. In the video, he asks a young British boy, Stuart Lockwood, whether he is getting his milk, and goes on to say, through his interpreter, &quot;We hope your presence as guests here will not be for too long. Your presence here, and in other places, is meant to prevent the scourge of war.&quot;

Another Iraqi proposal communicated in August 1990 was delivered to US National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft by an unidentified Iraqi official. The official communicated to the White House that Iraq would &quot;withdraw from Kuwait and allow foreigners to leave&quot; provided that the UN lifted sanctions, allowed &quot;guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf through the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warbah&quot;, and allowed Iraq to &quot;gain full control of the Rumaila oil field that extends slightly into Kuwaiti territory&quot;. The proposal also &quot;include[d] offers to negotiate an oil agreement with the United States &#x27;satisfactory to both nations&#x27; national security interests,&#x27; develop a joint plan &#x27;to alleviate Iraq&#x27;s economical and financial problems&#x27; and &#x27;jointly work on the stability of the gulf.&#x27;&quot;

On 29 November 1990, the Security Council passed Resolution 678, which gave Iraq until 15 January 1991 to withdraw from Kuwait, and empowered states to use &quot;all necessary means&quot; to force Iraq out of Kuwait after the deadline.

In December 1990, Iraq made a proposal to withdraw from Kuwait provided that foreign troops left the region and that an agreement was reached regarding the Palestinian problem and the dismantlement of both Israel&#x27;s and Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction. The White House rejected the proposal. The PLO&#x27;s Yasser Arafat expressed that neither he nor Saddam insisted that solving the Israel–Palestine issues should be a precondition to solving the issues in Kuwait, though he did acknowledge a &quot;strong link&quot; between these problems.

Ultimately, the US and UK stuck to their position that there would be no negotiations until Iraq withdrew from Kuwait and that they should not grant Iraq concessions, lest they give the impression that Iraq benefited from its military campaign. Also, when US Secretary of State James Baker met with Tariq Aziz in Geneva, Switzerland, for last minute peace talks in early 1991, Aziz reportedly made no concrete proposals and did not outline any hypothetical Iraqi moves.

On 14 January 1991, France proposed that the UN Security Council call for &quot;a rapid and massive withdrawal&quot; from Kuwait along with a statement to Iraq that Council members would bring their &quot;active contribution&quot; to a settlement of the region&#x27;s other problems, &quot;in particular, of the Arab–Israeli conflict and in particular to the Palestinian problem by convening, at an appropriate moment, an international conference&quot; to assure &quot;the security, stability and development of this region of the world.&quot; The French proposal was supported by Belgium (at the moment one of the rotating Council members), Germany, Spain, Italy, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and several non-aligned states. The US, the UK, and the Soviet Union rejected it; US Ambassador to the UN Thomas Pickering stated that the French proposal was unacceptable, because it went beyond previous Council resolutions on the Iraqi invasion. France dropped this proposal when it found &quot;no tangible sign of interest&quot; from Baghdad.

===Military means===


One of the main concerns in the Western world was the significant threat Iraq posed to Saudi Arabia. Following Kuwait&#x27;s conquest, the Iraqi Army was within easy striking distance of Saudi oil fields. Control of these fields, along with Kuwaiti and Iraqi reserves, would have given Saddam control over the majority of the world&#x27;s oil reserves. Iraq also had a number of grievances with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis had lent Iraq 26 billion dollars during its war with Iran. The Saudis had backed Iraq in that war, as they feared the influence of Shia Iran&#x27;s Islamic revolution on its own Shia minority. After the war, Saddam felt he should not have to repay the loans due to the help he had given the Saudis by fighting Iran.

Soon after his conquest of Kuwait, Saddam began verbally attacking the Saudis. He argued that the US-supported Saudi state was an illegitimate and unworthy guardian of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. He combined the language of the Islamist groups that had recently fought in Afghanistan with the rhetoric Iran had long used to attack the Saudis.

Acting on the Carter Doctrine policy, and out of fear the Iraqi Army could launch an invasion of Saudi Arabia, US President George H. W. Bush quickly announced that the US would launch a &quot;wholly defensive&quot; mission to prevent Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia, under the codename Operation Desert Shield. The operation began on 7 August 1990, when US troops were sent to Saudi Arabia, due also to the request of its monarch, King Fahd, who had earlier called for US military assistance. This &quot;wholly defensive&quot; doctrine was quickly abandoned when, on 8 August, Iraq declared Kuwait to be Iraq&#x27;s 19th province and Saddam named his cousin, Ali Hassan Al-Majid, as its military-governor.
The US Navy dispatched two naval battle groups built around the aircraft carriers USS &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; and USS &quot;Independence&quot; to the Persian Gulf, where they were ready by 8 August. The US also sent the battleships USS &quot;Missouri&quot; and USS &quot;Wisconsin&quot; to the region. A total of 48 US Air Force F-15s from the 1st Fighter Wing at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, landed in Saudi Arabia and immediately commenced round-the-clock air patrols of the Saudi–Kuwait–Iraq border to discourage further Iraqi military advances. They were joined by 36 F-15 A-Ds from the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing at Bitburg, Germany. The Bitburg contingent was based at Al Kharj Air Base, approximately an hour south east of Riyadh. The 36th TFW would be responsible for 11 confirmed Iraqi Air Force aircraft shot down during the war. Two Air National Guard units were stationed at Al Kharj Air Base, the South Carolina Air National Guard&#x27;s 169th Fighter Wing flew bombing missions with 24 F-16s flying 2,000 combat missions and dropping of munitions, and the New York Air National Guard&#x27;s 174th Fighter Wing from Syracuse flew 24 F-16s on bombing missions. Military buildup continued from there, eventually reaching 543,000 troops, twice the number used in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Much of the material was airlifted or carried to the staging areas via fast sealift ships, allowing a quick buildup. As part of the buildup, amphibious exercises were carried out in the Gulf, including Operation Imminent Thunder, which involved the USS &quot;Midway&quot; and 15 other ships, 1,100 aircraft, and a thousand Marines. In a press conference, General Schwarzkopf stated that these exercises were intended to deceive the Iraqi forces, forcing them to continue their defense of the Kuwaiti coastline.

===Creating a coalition===
A series of UN Security Council resolutions and Arab League resolutions were passed regarding Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait. Resolution 678, passed on 29 November 1990, gave Iraq a withdrawal deadline until 15 January 1991 and authorized &quot;all necessary means to uphold and implement Resolution 660&quot;, and a diplomatic formulation authorizing the use of force if Iraq failed to comply.

To ensure that the US received economic backing, James Baker went on an 11-day journey to nine countries in September 1990, which the press dubbed &quot;The Tin Cup Trip&quot;. The first stop was Saudi Arabia, which a month before had already granted permission to the United States to use its facilities. However, Baker believed that Saudi Arabia should assume some of the cost of the military efforts to defend it. When Baker asked King Fahd for $15 billion, the King readily agreed, with the promise that Baker ask Kuwait for the same amount.

The next day, 7 September, he did just that, and the Emir of Kuwait, displaced in a Sheraton hotel outside his invaded country, easily agreed. Baker then moved to enter talks with Egypt, whose leadership he considered &quot;the moderate voice of the Middle East&quot;. President Mubarak of Egypt was furious with Saddam for his invasion of Kuwait, and for the fact that Saddam had assured Mubarak that an invasion was not his intention. Egypt received approximately $7 billion in debt forgiveness for its providing of support and troops for the US-led intervention.

After stops in Helsinki and Moscow to smooth out Iraqi demands for a Middle-Eastern peace conference with the Soviet Union, Baker traveled to Syria to discuss its role in the crisis with its President Hafez Assad. Assad had a deep personal enmity towards Saddam, which was defined by the fact that &quot;Saddam had been trying to kill him [Assad] for years.&quot; Harboring this animosity and impressed with Baker&#x27;s diplomatic initiative to visit Damascus (relations had been severed since the 1983 bombing of US Marine barracks in Beirut), Assad agreed to pledge up to 100,000 Syrian troops to the coalition effort. This was a vital step in ensuring Arab states were represented in the coalition. In exchange, Washington gave al-Assad the green light to wipe out forces opposing Syria&#x27;s rule in Lebanon and arranged for weapons valued at a billion dollars to be provided to Syria, mostly through Gulf states. In exchange for Iran&#x27;s support for the US-led intervention, the US government promised the Iranian government to end US opposition to World Bank loans to Iran. On the day before the ground invasion began, the World Bank gave Iran the first loan of $250m.

Baker flew to Rome for a brief visit with the Italians in which he was promised the use of some military equipment, before journeying to Germany to meet with American ally Chancellor Kohl. Although Germany&#x27;s constitution (which was brokered essentially by the United States) prohibited military involvement outside Germany&#x27;s borders, Kohl committed a two billion dollar contribution to the coalition&#x27;s war effort, as well as further economic and military support of coalition ally Turkey, and the transportation of Egyptian soldiers and ships to the Persian Gulf.

A coalition of forces opposing Iraq&#x27;s aggression was formed, consisting of forces from 42 countries: Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States. It was the largest coalition since World War II. A group of Afghan mujahideen soldiers also reportedly joined towards the end of the war.

US Army General Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. was designated to be the commander of the coalition forces in the Persian Gulf area. The Soviet Union condemned Baghdad&#x27;s aggression against Kuwait, but did not support the United States and allied intervention in Iraq and tried to avert it.

Although they did not contribute any forces, Japan and Germany made financial contributions totaling $10 billion and $6.6 billion respectively. Luxembourg also provided financial support to the coalition. US troops represented 73% of the coalition&#x27;s 956,600 troops in Iraq.

Many of the coalition countries were reluctant to commit military forces. Some felt that the war was an internal Arab affair or did not want to increase US influence in the Middle East. In the end, however, many governments were persuaded by Iraq&#x27;s belligerence towards other Arab states, offers of economic aid or debt forgiveness, and threats to withhold aid.

====Justification for intervention====
The US and the UN gave several public justifications for involvement in the conflict, the most prominent being the Iraqi violation of Kuwaiti territorial integrity. In addition, the US moved to support its ally Saudi Arabia, whose importance in the region, and as a key supplier of oil, made it of considerable geopolitical importance. Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, US Defense Secretary Dick Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested US military assistance. During a speech in a special joint session of the US Congress given on 11 September 1990, Bush summed up the reasons with the following remarks: &quot;Within three days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia. It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression.&quot;

The Pentagon stated that satellite photos showing a buildup of Iraqi forces along the border were the source of this information, but this was later alleged to be false. A reporter for the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; acquired two commercial Soviet satellite images made at the time, which showed nothing but empty desert.

Other justifications for foreign involvement included Iraq&#x27;s history of human rights abuses under Saddam. Iraq was also known to possess biological weapons and chemical weapons, which Saddam had used against Iranian troops during the Iran–Iraq War and against his own country&#x27;s Kurdish population in the Al-Anfal campaign. Iraq was also known to have a nuclear weapons program; the report about it from January 1991 was partially declassified by the CIA on 26 May 2001.

====Public relations campaign targeting the public====

Although the Iraqi military committed human rights abuses during the invasion, the alleged incidents that received the most publicity in the US were fabrications of the public relations firm hired by the government of Kuwait to persuade Americans to support military intervention. Shortly after Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, the organization &quot;Citizens for a Free Kuwait&quot; was formed in the US. It hired the public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton for about $11 million, paid by Kuwait&#x27;s government.

Among many other means of influencing US opinion, such as distributing books on Iraqi atrocities to US soldiers deployed in the region, &quot;Free Kuwait&quot; T-shirts and speakers to college campuses, and dozens of video news releases to television stations, the firm arranged for an appearance before a group of members of the US Congress in which a young woman identifying herself as a nurse working in the Kuwait City hospital described Iraqi soldiers pulling babies out of incubators and letting them die on the floor.

The story helped tip both the public and Congress towards a war with Iraq: six Congressmen said the testimony was enough for them to support military action against Iraq and seven Senators referenced the testimony in debate. The Senate supported the military actions in a 52–47 vote. However, a year after the war, this allegation was revealed to be a fabrication. The young woman who had testified was found to be a member of Kuwait&#x27;s royal family and the daughter of Kuwait&#x27;s ambassador to the US. She had not lived in Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion.

The details of the Hill &amp; Knowlton public relations campaign, including the incubator testimony, were published in John R. MacArthur&#x27;s &quot;Second Front: Censorship and Propaganda in the Gulf War&quot;, and came to wide public attention when an Op-ed by MacArthur was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. This prompted a reexamination by Amnesty International, which had originally promoted an account alleging even greater numbers of babies torn from incubators than the original fake testimony. After finding no evidence to support it, the organization issued a retraction. President Bush then repeated the incubator allegations on television.

In reality, the Iraqi Army did commit various well-documented crimes during its occupation of Kuwait, such as the summary execution without trial of three brothers, after which their bodies were stacked and left to decay in a public street. Iraqi troops also ransacked and looted private Kuwaiti homes; one residence was repeatedly defecated in. A resident later commented: &quot;The whole thing was violence for the sake of violence, destruction for the sake of destruction ... Imagine a surrealistic painting by Salvador Dalí&quot;.

US President Bush repeatedly compared Saddam Hussein to Hitler.

==Early battles==

===Air campaign===

The Gulf War began with an extensive aerial bombing campaign on 16 January 1991. For 42 consecutive days and nights, the coalition forces subjected Iraq to one of the most intensive air bombardments in military history. The coalition flew over 100,000 sorties, dropping 88,500 tonnes of bombs, which widely destroyed military and civilian infrastructure.

Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses, including man-portable air-defense systems, were surprisingly ineffective against enemy aircraft, and the coalition suffered only 75 aircraft losses in over 100,000 sorties, 44 due to Iraqi action. Two of these losses are the result of aircraft colliding with the ground while evading Iraqi ground-fired weapons. One of these losses is a confirmed air-air victory.

===Iraqi Scud missile strikes on Israel and Saudi Arabia===

Iraq&#x27;s government made no secret that it would attack Israel if invaded. Prior to the war&#x27;s start, in the aftermath of the failed US–Iraq peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, a reporter asked Iraq&#x27;s English-speaking Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz: &quot;Mr. Foreign Minister, if war starts ... will you attack Israel?&quot; His response was: &quot;Yes, absolutely, yes.&quot;

Five hours after the first attacks, Iraq&#x27;s state radio broadcast declared that &quot;The dawn of victory nears as this great showdown begins.&quot; Iraq fired eight missiles the next day. These missile attacks were to continue throughout the war. Iraq fired 88 Scud missiles during the war&#x27;s seven weeks.

Iraq hoped to provoke a military response from Israel. The Iraqi government hoped that many Arab states would withdraw from the Coalition, as they would be reluctant to fight alongside Israel. Following the first attacks, Israeli Air Force jets were deployed to patrol the northern airspace with Iraq. Israel prepared to militarily retaliate, as its policy for the previous 40 years had always been retaliation. However, President Bush pressured Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir not to retaliate and withdraw Israeli jets, fearing that if Israel attacked Iraq, the other Arab states would either desert the coalition or join Iraq. It was also feared that if Israel used Syrian or Jordanian airspace to attack Iraq, they would intervene in the war on Iraq&#x27;s side or attack Israel. The coalition promised to deploy Patriot missiles to defend Israel if it refrained from responding to the Scud attacks.

The Scud missiles targeting Israel were relatively ineffective, as firing at extreme range resulted in a dramatic reduction in accuracy and payload. Two Israeli civilians died as a direct result of the missile attacks. Between 11 and 74 were killed from incorrect use of gas masks, heart attacks, and incorrect use of the anti-chemical weapons drug atropine. Approximately 230 Israelis were injured. Extensive property damage was also caused, and, according to the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, &quot;Damage to general property consisted of 1,302 houses, 6,142 apartments, 23 public buildings, 200 shops and 50 cars.&quot; It was feared that Iraq would fire missiles filled with nerve agents such as sarin. As a result, Israel&#x27;s government issued gas masks to its citizens. When the first Iraqi missiles hit Israel, some people injected themselves with an antidote for nerve gas. It has been suggested that the sturdy construction techniques used in Israeli cities, coupled with the fact that Scuds were only launched at night, played an important role in limiting the number of casualties from Scud attacks.

In response to the threat of Scuds on Israel, the US rapidly sent a Patriot missile air defense artillery battalion to Israel along with two batteries of MIM-104 Patriot missiles for the protection of civilians. The Royal Netherlands Air Force also deployed a Patriot missile squadron to Israel and Turkey. The Dutch Defense Ministry later stated that the military use of the Patriot missile system was largely ineffective, but its psychological value for the affected populations was high.

Coalition air forces were also extensively exercised in &quot;Scud hunts&quot; in the Iraqi desert, trying to locate the camouflaged trucks before they fired their missiles at Israel or Saudi Arabia. On the ground, special operations forces also infiltrated Iraq, tasked with locating and destroying Scuds – including the ill-fated Bravo Two Zero patrol of the SAS. Once special operations were combined with air patrols, the number of attacks fell sharply, then increased slightly as Iraqi forces adjusted to coalition tactics.

As the Scud attacks continued, the Israelis grew increasingly impatient, and considered taking unilateral military action against Iraq. On 22 January 1991, a Scud missile hit the Israeli city of Ramat Gan, after two coalition Patriots failed to intercept it. Three elderly people suffered fatal heart attacks, another 96 people were injured, and 20 apartment buildings were damaged. After this attack, the Israelis warned that if the US failed to stop the attacks, they would. At one point, Israeli commandos boarded helicopters prepared to fly into Iraq, but the mission was called off after a phone call from US Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, reporting on the extent of coalition efforts to destroy Scuds and emphasizing that Israeli intervention could endanger US forces.

In addition to the attacks on Israel, 47 Scud missiles were fired into Saudi Arabia, and one missile was fired at Bahrain and another at Qatar. The missiles were fired at both military and civilian targets. One Saudi civilian was killed, and 78 others were injured. No casualties were reported in Bahrain or Qatar. The Saudi government issued all its citizens and expatriates with gas masks in the event of Iraq using missiles with warheads containing chemical weapons. The government broadcast alerts and &#x27;all clear&#x27; messages over television to warn citizens during Scud attacks.

On 25 February 1991, a Scud missile hit a US Army barracks of the 14th Quartermaster Detachment, out of Greensburg, Pennsylvania, stationed in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 soldiers and injuring over 100. A subsequent investigation found that the assigned Patriot missile battery had failed to engage due to the loss of significance effect in the onboard computer&#x27;s floating point calculations compounding over 100 hours of consecutive use, shifting the range gate position far enough to lose contact with the Scud during tracking action.

===Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia (Battle of Khafji)===


On 29 January, Iraqi forces attacked and occupied the lightly defended Saudi city of Khafji with tanks and infantry. The Battle of Khafji ended two days later when the Iraqis were driven back by the Saudi Arabian National Guard, supported by Qatari forces and US Marines. The allied forces used extensive artillery fire.

Both sides suffered casualties, although Iraqi forces sustained substantially more dead and captured than the allied forces. Eleven Americans were killed in two separate friendly fire incidents, an additional 14 US airmen were killed when their AC-130 gunship was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile, and two US soldiers were captured during the battle. Saudi and Qatari forces had a total of 18 dead. Iraqi forces in Khafji had 60–300 dead and 400 captured.

The Battle of Khafji was an example of how air power could single-handedly hinder the advance of enemy ground forces. Upon learning of Iraqi troop movements, 140 coalition aircraft were diverted to attack an advancing column consisting of two armored divisions in battalion-sized units. Precision stand-off attacks were conducted during the night and through to the next day. Iraqi vehicle losses included 357 tanks, 147 armored personnel carriers, and 89 mobile artillery pieces. Some crews simply abandoned their vehicles upon realizing that they could be destroyed by guided bombs, stopping the divisions from massing for an organized attack on the town. One Iraqi soldier, who had fought in the Iran–Iraq War, remarked that his brigade &quot;had sustained more punishment from allied airpower in 30 minutes at Khafji than in eight years of fighting against Iran.&quot;

==Counter reconnaissance for 2nd Armoured Division==
Task Force 1-41 Infantry was a US Army heavy battalion task force from the 2nd Armoured Division (Forward). 2nd Armoured Division (Forward) included the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 66th Armor Regiment, and the 4th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment. Task Force 1–41 was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991, and to conduct ground combat operations in Iraq against the enemy on 17 February 1991. Shortly after arrival in theatre &quot;..the battalion received, for planning, a brigade cross-boundary counter-reconnaissance mission.&quot; 1–41 Infantry was assisted by the 1st Squadron, 4th Armored Cavalry Regiment. This joint effort would become known as Task Force Iron. Counter-reconnaissance generally includes destroying or repelling the enemy&#x27;s reconnaissance elements and denying their commander any observation of friendly forces. On 15 February 1991 4th Battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment fired on a trailer and a few trucks in the Iraqi sector observing American forces.

On 16 February 1991 several groups of Iraqi vehicles appeared to be performing reconnaissance on the Task Force and were driven away by fire from 4–3 FA. Another enemy platoon, including six vehicles, was reported as being to the northeast of the Task Force. They were engaged with artillery fire from 4–3 FA. Later that evening another group of Iraqi vehicles was spotted moving towards the center of the Task Force. They appeared to be Iraqi Soviet-made BTRs and tanks. For the next hour the Task Force fought several small battles with Iraqi reconnaissance units. TF 1–41 IN fired TOW missiles at the Iraqi formation destroying one tank. The rest of the formation was destroyed or driven away by artillery fire from 4–3 FA. On 17 February 1991 the Task Force took enemy mortar fire, but the enemy forces managed to escape. Later that evening the Task Force received enemy artillery fire but suffered no casualties. That same evening the Task Force identified an Iraqi mortar position and engaged it with both direct and indirect fires. The Iraqis continued probing operations against the Task Force for approximately two hours. For the next two days the Task Force observed Iraqi wheeled vehicles and small units move in front of them. Several times Iraqi mortars fired on Task Force 1–41 Infantry positions. On 18 February Iraqi mortar positions continued to conduct fire missions against the Task Force. The Task Force returned fire on the Iraqi positions with artillery fire from 4–3 FA and 1st Infantry Division Artillery. During the Iraqi mortar attacks two American soldiers were wounded. Iraqi reconnaissance elements continued to patrol the area between the Task Force and the 1st Cavalry Division. VII Corps air units and artillery conducted combat operations against Iraqi defensive positions.

==Breach==


Task Force 1–41 Infantry was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991 and conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991. Prior to this action the Task Force&#x27;s primary fire support battalion, 4th Battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, participated in a massive artillery preparation. Around 300 guns from multiple countries participated in the artillery barrage. Over 14,000 rounds were fired during these missions. M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems contributed an additional 4,900 rockets fired at Iraqi targets. Iraq lost close to 22 artillery battalions during the initial stages of this barrage, including the destruction of approximately 396 Iraqi artillery pieces.

By the end of these raids Iraqi artillery assets had all but ceased to exist. One Iraqi unit that was totally destroyed during the preparation was the Iraqi 48th Infantry Division Artillery Group. The group&#x27;s commander stated his unit lost 83 of its 100 guns to the artillery preparation. The artillery bombardment was supplemented by Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombing raids and Lockheed AC-130 attacks. AH-64 Apache attack helicopters from the 1st Infantry Division and B-52 bombers attacked the Iraqi 110th Infantry Brigade. Under enemy fire, the 1st and 9th Engineer Battalions marked and proofed assault lanes to secure a foothold in enemy territory and pass the 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Armoured Division forward.
On 24 February 1991 the 1st Cavalry Division fired its artillery against Iraqi artillery units. One artillery mission struck a series of Iraqi bunkers, reinforced by Iraqi T-55 tanks, in the sector of the Iraqi 25th Infantry Division. The same day the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division with the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor, and the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry destroyed Iraqi bunkers and combat vehicles in the sector of the Iraqi 25th Infantry Division. On 24 February 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division rolled through the breach in the Iraqi defense west of Wadi al-Batin and also cleared the northeastern sector of the breach site of enemy resistance. Task Force 3–37th Armor breached the Iraqi defense clearing four passage lanes and expanding the gap under direct enemy fire. Also on 24 February the 1st Infantry Division along with the 1st Cavalry Division destroyed Iraqi outposts and patrols belonging to the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division. The two divisions also began capturing prisoners. The 1st Infantry Division cleared a zone between Phase Line Vermont and Phase Line Kansas. Once the 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, 37th Armor reached the Iraqi rear defensive positions it destroyed an Iraqi D-30 artillery battery and many trucks and bunkers.

Task Force 1–41 Infantry was given the task of breaching Iraq&#x27;s initial defensive positions along the Iraq–Saudi Arabia border. The 1st Squadron, 4th Armored Cavalry Regiment handled similar responsibilities in its sector of operations. The 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s 5th Battalion, 16th Infantry also played a significant role clearing the trenches and captured 160 Iraqi soldiers in the process. Once into Iraqi territory Task Force 1–41 Infantry encountered multiple Iraqi defensive positions and bunkers. These defensive positions were occupied by a brigade-sized element. Task Force 1–41 Infantry elements dismounted and prepared to engage the enemy soldiers who occupied these well-prepared and heavily fortified bunkers. The Task Force found itself engaged in six hours of combat in order to clear the extensive bunker complex. The Iraqis engaged the Task Force with small arms fire, RPGs, mortar fire, and what was left of Iraqi artillery assets. A series of battles unfolded resulting in heavy Iraqi casualties and the Iraqis being removed from their defensive positions with many becoming prisoners of war. Some escaped to be killed or captured by other coalition forces. In the process of clearing the bunkers, Task Force 1–41 captured two brigade command posts and the command post of the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division. The Task Force also captured a brigade commander, several battalion commanders, company commanders, and staff officers. As combat operations progressed Task Force 1–41 Infantry engaged at short range multiple dug in enemy tanks in ambush positions. For a few hours, bypassed Iraqi RPG-equipped anti-tank teams, T-55 tanks, and dismounted Iraqi infantry fired at passing American vehicles, only to be destroyed by other US tanks and fighting vehicles following the initial forces.

The 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s Task Force 2–16 Infantry cleared four lanes simultaneously through an enemy fortified trench system while inflicting heavy casualties on Iraqi forces. Task Force 2–16 continued the attack clearing over of entrenched enemy positions resulting in the capture and destruction of numerous enemy vehicles, equipment, personnel and command bunkers.

==Ground campaign==

A 90,000 round artillery preparation fire on Iraqi defensive positions preceded the major ground assault, lasting 2.5 hours. 1st Infantry Division Artillery, which included 4-3 FA battalion, was decisive during artillery combat operations performing multiple raids and fire missions. These combat operations resulted in the destruction of 50 enemy tanks, 139 APCs, 30 air defense systems, 152 artillery pieces, 27 missile launchers, 108 mortars, and 548 wheeled vehicles, 61 trench lines and bunker positions, 92 dug in and open infantry targets, and 34 logistical sites. The ground campaign consisted of three or possibly four of the largest tank battles in American military history. The battles at 73 Easting, Norfolk, and Medina Ridge are well noted for their historical significance. Some consider the Battle of Medina Ridge the largest tank battle of the war. Other sources consider the Battle of Norfolk the largest tank battle of the war and the second largest tank battle in American history. The U.S. Marine Corps also fought the biggest tank battle in its history at Kuwait International Airport. The U.S. 3rd Armored Division also fought a significant battle at Objective Dorset not far from where the Battle of Norfolk was taking place. The U.S. 3rd Armored Division destroyed approximately 300 enemy combat vehicles during this particular encounter with Iraqi forces.

The U.S. VII Corps was the primary combat formation of the coalition forces. It was a formidable fighting force consisting of 1,487 tanks, 1,384 infantry fighting vehicles, 568 artillery pieces, 132 MLRS, 8 missile launchers, and 242 attack helicopters. It had a total troop strength of 146,321 troops. Its primary full strength fighting formations were the 1st Armored Division (United States), the 3rd Armored Division (United States) and the 1st Infantry Division (United States). The 2nd Armored Division (Forward) was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division as its third maneuver brigade. Its Task Force 1-41 Infantry would be the spearhead of VII Corps. In addition, the corps had the 2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States) to act as a scouting and screening force, and two further heavy divisions, the 1st Cavalry Division (United States) and the United Kingdom&#x27;s 1st Armoured Division, as well as the U.S. 11th Aviation Group. VII Corps fought a number of large battles against Iraqi forces. Some of them historical in scope and size. Three of the battles at Norfolk, Medina Ridge, and 73 Easting are considered among the largest tank battles in history. By the end of combat operations on 28 February 1991, U.S. VII Corps had driven , captured 22,000 Iraqi soldiers, and destroyed 1,350 Iraqi tanks, 1,224 armored personnel carriers, 285 artillery pieces, 105 air defense systems, and 1,229 trucks.
The primary combat vehicles of the American divisions were the M1A1 Abrams tank and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle. The primary American artillery system was the self propelled M109 howitzer. The primary American attack helicopter was the Boeing AH-64 Apache (Army) with the Bell AH-1 Cobra (Army and Marines) also being in theatre. The U.S. Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft would distinguish itself during the Gulf War aided by the OH-58D JAATT eyes in the sky. Together they inflicted significant damage on Iraqi ground forces. U.S. A-10 &quot;Warthog&quot; crews would destroy 900 Iraqi tanks, 2,000 other military vehicles and 1,200 artillery pieces during combat operations.

The U.S. Marine Corps was represented by the 1st Marine Division and the 2nd Marine Division. They were supported by the U.S. Army&#x27;s 2nd Armored Division&#x27;s Tiger Brigade to provide the Marines with additional armor support. Marine armor units mostly consisted of the older M-60 tank. The 1st Marine Division destroyed around 60 Iraqi tanks near the Burgan oil field without suffering any losses. The 1st Marine Division Task Force Ripper led the drive to the Kuwait International Airport on 27 February 1991. Marine Task Force Ripper destroyed about 100 Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers, including T-72 tanks. The division commander Maj. Gen. J.M. Myatt said, &quot;During the first day of combat operations 1st Platoon, D Company, 3rd Tank Battalion destroyed 15 Iraqi tanks&quot;. The Marines also destroyed 25 APCs and took 300 prisoners of war. The U.S.M.C. would often encounter the Iraqi 3rd Armored Division in their theater of operations. Once the 1st Marine Division reached Kuwait International Airport they found what remained of the Iraqi 12th Armored Brigade, 3rd Armored Division defending it. The Marines destroyed 30 to 40 Iraqi T-72 tanks which had taken up defensive positions around the airport. The Iraqi 3rd Armored Division losses included more than 250 T-55/62s and 70 T-72 tanks by the end of combat operations. The Iraqi 3rd Armored Division would be totally destroyed. The 2nd Marine Division played a major role repelling the attempted Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia which is known as the Battle of Khafji. The 2nd Marine Division also faced heavy resistance during the Battle of Kuwait International Airport. The battle featured the &quot;Reveille Engagement&quot; which went on to become the largest tank battle in United States Marine Corps&#x27; entire history. Marine Reserve unit Bravo Company, 4th Tank Battalion, 4th Marine division was assigned to the 2nd Marine Division. Bravo Company destroyed a total of 119 enemy vehicles and took over 800 POWs by the end of combat operations. The 1st Tank Battalion claimed 50 Iraqi T-55 and T-62 tanks and 25 APCs. The 3rd Battalion claimed 57 T-55s and T-62s along with 5 T-72s, 7 APCs, and 10 trucks. The 8th Battalion destroyed more than three dozen tanks and a number of other vehicles. U.S. Marine Corps armor units would destroy hundreds of Iraqi tanks by the end of combat operations. U.S. Marine Corps tank losses would be light as they suffered the loss of ten M-60 tanks during combat operations.

The United Kingdom was represented by its 1st Armoured Division known as the Desert Rats. The British 1st Armoured Division fielded approximately 176 Challenger 1 tanks. British infantry rode into battle on the Warrior tracked armoured vehicle. It had reasonable armour protection and a 30mm gun. Modified versions of the vehicle included mortar carriers, MILAN antitank systems, and command and control vehicles; and the British possessed a variety of excellent light armoured vehicles built on their FV101 Scorpion chassis. British artillery was primarily American made M109 howitzers (155mm), M110 howitzers (203mm), and M270 MLRS which were compatible with American systems. Their air support consisted of Gazelle helicopters, used for reconnaissance, and the Lynx helicopter which was comparable to the American AH-1 Cobra. The British had their full contingent of engineer, logistics, and medical units.

The British 1st Armoured Division was responsible for protecting the right flank of VII Corps. It was assumed by the Corps&#x27; planners the Iraqi 52nd Armored Division would counterattack VII Corps once their penetration into Iraqi defenses was discovered. The British 1st Armoured Division had two brigades (the 4th and 7th) which participated in Operation Granby, the name given to the British military operations during the 1991 Gulf War. The British 1st Armoured Division had traveled 217 miles in 97 hours. The British 1st Armored Division had captured or destroyed about 300 Iraqi tanks and a very large number of armored personnel carriers, trucks, reconnaissance vehicles, etc. The Desert Rats also destroyed multiple Iraqi artillery positions. The division also took over 7,000 Iraqi prisoners of war including two division commanders and two other general officers. The British 1st Armoured Division destroyed or isolated four Iraqi infantry divisions (the 26th, 48th, 31st, and 25th) and overran the Iraqi 52nd Armored Division in several sharp engagements. The Iraqi 80th Armored Brigade would also fall victim to the British 1st Armoured Division.

Iraq was represented mostly by its own VII Corps and its Jihad Corps. Its most notable participants were its elite Republican Guard Divisions Tawakalna, Medina, Hammurabi, and Adnan. The first three of these had a strength of over 660 tanks, 660 infantry fighting vehicles, and thousands of antitank weapons, self propelled artillery, and other combat systems. The Tawakalna Republican Guard Division was Iraq&#x27;s most powerful division which included approximately 14,000 soldiers, 220 T-72 tanks, 284 infantry fighting vehicles, 126 artillery pieces, and 18 MLRS. The Iraqi 52nd Armored Division was also a primary participant. It was a powerful division consisting of 245 tanks and 195 armored fighting vehicles. The Iraqi 10th and 12th Armored Divisions were also present. The two divisions formed the foundation of the Jihad Corps. The Iraqi 10th Armored Division was considered the best regular division in the Iraqi Army. It had more modern equipment than the other regular Iraqi units. It was equipped with T-72 and T-62 tanks. The T-62 tank being its primary system. Overall the primary tank of the Iraqi forces was the T-55 tank. The Iraqis fielded them in great numbers. The Iraqis also had elements of two other independent armored brigades in theatre, those being the 50th and 29th Armored Brigades.
Iraq would also field multiple Infantry Divisions.

The Iraqis suffered the loss of over 3,000 tanks and over 2,000 other combat vehicles during these battles against the American-led coalition. It is estimated that Iraqi forces suffered 20,000–50,000 troops killed during combat operations. It is also estimated that over 75,000 Iraqi soldiers were wounded. Between 80,000 and 175,000 Iraqi troops were taken prisoner. Iraqi forces inflicted very minimal damage on Coalition forces.

===Liberation of Kuwait===


US decoy attacks by air attacks and naval gunfire the night before Kuwait&#x27;s liberation were designed to make the Iraqis believe the main coalition ground attack would focus on central Kuwait. For months, American units in Saudi Arabia had been under almost constant Iraqi artillery fire, as well as threats from Scud missiles and chemical attacks. On 24 February 1991, the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions and the 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion crossed into Kuwait and headed toward Kuwait City. They encountered trenches, barbed wire, and minefields. However, these positions were poorly defended, and were overrun in the first few hours. Several tank battles took place, but otherwise coalition troops encountered minimal resistance, as most Iraqi troops surrendered. The general pattern was that the Iraqis would put up a short fight before surrendering. However, Iraqi air defenses shot down nine US aircraft. Meanwhile, forces from Arab states advanced into Kuwait from the east, encountering little resistance and suffering few casualties.

Despite the successes of coalition forces, it was feared that the Iraqi Republican Guard would escape into Iraq before it could be destroyed. It was decided to send British armored forces into Kuwait 15 hours ahead of schedule, and to send US forces after the Republican Guard. The coalition advance was preceded by a heavy artillery and rocket barrage, after which 150,000 troops and 1,500 tanks began their advance. Iraqi forces in Kuwait counterattacked against US troops, acting on a direct order from Saddam Hussein himself. Despite the intense combat, the Americans repulsed the Iraqis and continued to advance towards Kuwait City.

Kuwaiti forces were tasked with liberating the city. Iraqi troops offered only light resistance. The Kuwaitis quickly liberated the city despite losing one soldier and having one plane shot down. On 27 February, and President Bush declared it liberated. However, an Iraqi unit at Kuwait International Airport appeared not to have received the message and fiercely resisted. US Marines had to fight for hours before securing the airport, after which Kuwait was declared secure. After four days of fighting, Iraqi forces were expelled from Kuwait. As part of a scorched earth policy, they set fire to nearly 700 oil wells and placed land mines around the wells to make extinguishing the fires more difficult.

===Initial moves into Iraq===

The war&#x27;s ground phase was officially designated Operation Desert Saber. The first units to move into Iraq were three patrols of the British Special Air Service&#x27;s B squadron, call signs Bravo One Zero, Bravo Two Zero, and Bravo Three Zero, in late January. These eight-man patrols landed behind Iraqi lines to gather intelligence on the movements of Scud mobile missile launchers, which could not be detected from the air, as they were hidden under bridges and camouflage netting during the day. Other objectives included the destruction of the launchers and their fiber-optic communications arrays that lay in pipelines and relayed coordinates to the TEL operators launching attacks against Israel. The operations were designed to prevent any possible Israeli intervention. Due to lack of sufficient ground cover to carry out their assignment, One Zero and Three Zero abandoned their operations, while Two Zero remained, and was later compromised, with only Sergeant Chris Ryan escaping to Syria.

Elements of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Battalion 5th Cavalry of the 1st Cavalry Division of the US Army performed a direct attack into Iraq on 15 February 1991, followed by one in force on 20 February that led directly through seven Iraqi divisions which were caught off guard. On 17 January 1991 the 101st Airborne Division Aviation Regiment fired the first shots of the war when eight AH-64 helicopters successfully destroyed two Iraqi early warning radar sites. From 15 to 20 February, the Battle of Wadi al-Batin took place inside Iraq; this was the first of two attacks by 1 Battalion 5th Cavalry of the 1st Cavalry Division. It was a feint attack, designed to make the Iraqis think that a coalition invasion would take place from the south. The Iraqis fiercely resisted, and the Americans eventually withdrew as planned back into the Wadi al-Batin. Three US soldiers were killed and nine wounded, with one M2 Bradley IFV turret destroyed, but they had taken 40 prisoners and destroyed five tanks, and successfully deceived the Iraqis. This attack led the way for the XVIII Airborne Corps to sweep around behind the 1st Cav and attack Iraqi forces to the west. On 22 February 1991, Iraq agreed to a Soviet-proposed ceasefire agreement. The agreement called for Iraq to withdraw troops to pre-invasion positions within six weeks following a total ceasefire, and called for monitoring of the ceasefire and withdrawal to be overseen by the UN Security Council.

The coalition rejected the proposal, but said that retreating Iraqi forces would not be attacked, and gave 24 hours for Iraq to withdraw its forces. On 23 February, fighting resulted in the capture of 500 Iraqi soldiers. On 24 February, British and American armored forces crossed the Iraq–Kuwait border and entered Iraq in large numbers, taking hundreds of prisoners. Iraqi resistance was light, and four Americans were killed.

===Coalition forces enter Iraq===
Shortly afterwards, the US VII Corps, in full strength and spearheaded by the 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, launched an armored attack into Iraq early on 24 February, just to the west of Kuwait, surprising Iraqi forces. Simultaneously, the US XVIII Airborne Corps launched a sweeping &quot;left-hook&quot; attack across southern Iraq&#x27;s largely undefended desert, led by the US 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized). This movement&#x27;s left flank was protected by the French Division Daguet. The 101st Airborne Division conducted a combat air assault into enemy territory. The 101st Airborne Division had struck behind enemy lines. It was the deepest air assault operation in history. Approximately 400 helicopters transported 2,000 soldiers into Iraq where they destroyed Iraqi columns trying to flee westward and prevented the escape of Iraqi forces. The 101st Airborne Division travelled a further into Iraq. By nightfall, the 101st cut off Highway 8 which was a vital supply line running between Basra and the Iraqi forces. The 101st had lost 16 soldiers in action during the 100-hour war and captured thousands of enemy prisoners of war.

The French force quickly overcame Iraq&#x27;s 45th Infantry Division, suffering light casualties and taking a large number of prisoners, and took up blocking positions to prevent an Iraqi counterattack on the coalition&#x27;s flank. The movement&#x27;s right flank was protected by the United Kingdom&#x27;s 1st Armoured Division. Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory, they turned eastward, launching a flank attack against the elite Republican Guard before it could escape. The Iraqis resisted fiercely from dug-in positions and stationary vehicles, and even mounted armored charges.

Unlike many previous engagements, the destruction of the first Iraqi tanks did not result in a mass surrender. The Iraqis suffered massive losses and lost dozens of tanks and vehicles, while US casualties were comparatively low, with a single Bradley knocked out. Coalition forces pressed another into Iraqi territory, and captured their objective within three hours. They took 500 prisoners and inflicted heavy losses, defeating Iraq&#x27;s 26th Infantry Division. A US soldier was killed by an Iraqi land mine, another five by friendly fire, and 30 wounded during the battle. Meanwhile, British forces attacked Iraq&#x27;s Medina Division and a major Republican Guard logistics base. In nearly two days of some of the war&#x27;s most intense fighting, the British destroyed 40 enemy tanks and captured a division commander.

Meanwhile, US forces attacked the village of Al Busayyah, meeting fierce resistance. The US force destroyed military hardware and took prisoners, while suffering no casualties.

On 25 February 1991, Iraqi forces fired a Scud missile at an American barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The missile attack killed 28 US military personnel.

The coalition&#x27;s advance was much swifter than US generals had expected. On 26 February, Iraqi troops began retreating from Kuwait, after they had set 737 of its oil wells on fire. A long convoy of retreating Iraqi troops formed along the main Iraq–Kuwait highway. Although they were retreating, this convoy was bombed so extensively by coalition air forces that it came to be known as the Highway of Death. Thousands of Iraqi troops were killed. American, British, and French forces continued to pursue retreating Iraqi forces over the border and back into Iraq, eventually moving to within of Baghdad, before withdrawing back to Iraq&#x27;s border with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

==End of active hostilities==
In coalition-occupied Iraqi territory, a peace conference was held where a ceasefire agreement was negotiated and signed by both sides. At the conference, Iraq was authorized to fly armed helicopters on their side of the temporary border, ostensibly for government transit due to the damage done to civilian infrastructure. Soon after, these helicopters and much of Iraq&#x27;s military were used to fight an uprising in the south. On March 1, 1991, one day after the Gulf War ceasefire, a revolt broke out in Basra against the Iraqi government. The uprising spread within days to all of the largest Shia cities in southern Iraq: Najaf, Amarah, Diwaniya, Hilla, Karbala, Kut, Nasiriyah and Samawah. The rebellions were encouraged by an airing of &quot;The Voice of Free Iraq&quot; on 24 February 1991, which was broadcast from a CIA-run radio station out of Saudi Arabia. The Arabic service of the Voice of America supported the uprising by stating that the rebellion was well supported, and that they would soon be liberated from Saddam.

In the North, Kurdish leaders took American statements that they would support an uprising to heart, and began fighting, hoping to trigger a coup d&#x27;état. However, when no US support came, Iraqi generals remained loyal to Saddam and brutally crushed the Kurdish uprising and the uprising in the south. Millions of Kurds fled across the mountains to Turkey and Kurdish areas of Iran. On April 5, the Iraqi government announced &quot;the complete crushing of acts of sedition, sabotage and rioting in all towns of Iraq.&quot; An estimated 25,000 to 100,000 Iraqis were killed in the uprisings. These events later resulted in no-fly zones being established in northern and southern Iraq.

In Kuwait, the Emir was restored, and suspected Iraqi collaborators were repressed. Eventually, over 400,000 people were expelled from the country, including a large number of Palestinians, because of PLO support of Saddam. Yasser Arafat did not apologize for his support of Iraq, but after his death Mahmoud Abbas formally apologized in 2004 on behalf of the PLO. This came after the Kuwaiti government formally forgave the group.

There was some criticism of the Bush administration, as they chose to allow Saddam to remain in power instead of pushing on to capture Baghdad and overthrowing his government. In their co-written 1998 book, &quot;A World Transformed&quot;, Bush and Brent Scowcroft argued that such a course would have fractured the alliance, and would have had many unnecessary political and human costs associated with it.

In 1992, the US Defense Secretary during the war, Dick Cheney, made the same point:

On 10 March 1991, 540,000 US troops began moving out of the Persian Gulf.

On 15 March 1991, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah returned to Kuwait, staying at the private home of a wealthy Kuwaiti as his own palace had been destroyed. He was met with a symbolic arrival with several dozens cars filled with people honking their horns and waving Kuwaiti flags who tried to follow the Emir&#x27;s convoy. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he faced a population divided between those who stayed and those who fled, a government straining to reassert control and a rejuvenated opposition that is pressing for greater democracy and other postwar changes, including voting rights for women. Democracy advocates had been calling for restoration of Parliament that the Emir had suspended in 1986.

==Coalition involvement==

Coalition members included Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Luxembourg, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States. The United States had 700,000 troops.

Germany and Japan provided financial assistance and donated military hardware, although they did not send direct military assistance. This later became known as &quot;checkbook diplomacy&quot;.

===Australia===
Australia contributed a Naval Task Group, which formed part of the multi-national fleet in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, under Operation Damask. In addition, medical teams were deployed aboard a US hospital ship, and a naval clearance diving team took part in de-mining Kuwait&#x27;s port facilities following the end of combat operations. Australian forces experienced a number of incidents in the first number of weeks of the Desert Storm Campaign including the detection of significant air threats from Iraq as a part of the outer perimeter of Battle Force Zulu; the detection of free sea floating mines and assistance to the aircraft carrier . The Australian Task Force was also placed at great risk with regard to the sea mine threat, with narrowly avoiding a mine. The Australians played a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following Kuwait&#x27;s invasion. Following the war&#x27;s end, Australia deployed a medical unit on Operation Habitat to northern Iraq as part of Operation Provide Comfort.

===Argentina===

Argentina was the only South American country to participate in the 1991 Gulf War. It sent a destroyer, ARA Almirante Brown (D-10), a corvette, ARA Spiro (P-43) (later replaced by another corvette, ARA Rosales (P-42)) and a supply ship, ARA &quot;Bahía San Blas&quot; (B-4) to participate on the United Nations blockade and sea control effort of the Persian Gulf. The success of &quot;Operación Alfil&quot; (English: &quot;Operation Bishop&quot;) with more than 700 interceptions and sailed in the theatre of operations helped to overcome the so-called &quot;Malvinas syndrome&quot;.

Argentina was later classified by the US as a major non-NATO ally due to its contributions during the war.

===Canada===
Canada was one of the first countries to condemn Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, and it quickly agreed to join the US-led coalition. In August 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney committed the Canadian Forces to deploy a Naval Task Group. The destroyers and joined the maritime interdiction force supported by the supply ship in Operation Friction. The Canadian Task Group led the coalition&#x27;s maritime logistics forces in the Persian Gulf. A fourth ship, , arrived in-theater after hostilities had ceased and was the first allied ship to visit Kuwait.

Following the UN-authorized use of force against Iraq, the Canadian Forces deployed a CF-18 Hornet and CH-124 Sea King squadron with support personnel, as well as a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war. When the air war began, the CF-18s were integrated into the coalition force and provided air cover and attacked ground targets. This was the first time since the Korean War that the Canadian Armed Forces had participated in an offensive. The only CF-18 Hornet to record an official victory during the conflict was an aircraft involved in the beginning of the Battle of Bubiyan against the Iraqi Navy.

===France===

The second largest European contingent was from France, which committed 18,000 troops. Operating on the left flank of the US XVIII Airborne Corps, the French Army force was the Division Daguet, including troops from the French Foreign Legion. Initially, the French operated independently under national command and control, but coordinated closely with the Americans (via CENTCOM) and Saudis. In January, the Division was placed under the tactical control of the XVIII Airborne Corps. France also deployed several combat aircraft and naval units. The French called their contribution Opération Daguet.

===Italy===
Following the invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq, on September 25, 1990, the Italian Government sent eight multirole fighter bombers Tornado IDS (plus two spare) in the Persian Gulf, belonging to the 6º, 36º and 50º Stormo, which were deployed at the Al Dhafra Air Base, near Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. During the 42 days of war, Italian fighters made 226 sorties for a total of 589 flight hours. The Italian Air Force recorded the loss of a single aircraft in the Gulf War. The use of Italian aircraft as part of the Desert Storm operation represented the first operational employment in combat missions of Italian Air Force aircraft since the end of World War II.

===United Kingdom===

The United Kingdom committed the largest contingent of any European state that participated in the war&#x27;s combat operations. Operation Granby was the code name for the operations in the Persian Gulf. British Army regiments (mainly with the 1st Armoured Division), Royal Air Force, Naval Air Squadrons and Royal Navy vessels were mobilized in the Persian Gulf. Both Royal Air Force and Naval Air Squadrons, using various aircraft, operated from airbases in Saudi Arabia and Naval Air Squadrons from various vessels in the Persian Gulf. The United Kingdom played a major role in the Battle of Norfolk, where its forces destroyed over 200 Iraqi tanks and a large quantity of other vehicles. After 48 hours of combat the British 1st Armoured Division destroyed or isolated four Iraqi infantry divisions (the 26th, 48th, 31st, and 25th) and overran the Iraqi 52nd Armored Division in several sharp engagements.

Chief Royal Navy vessels deployed to the Persian Gulf included &quot;Broadsword&quot;-class frigates, and &quot;Sheffield&quot;-class destroyers; other R.N. and RFA ships were also deployed. The light aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea.

Several SAS squadrons were deployed.

A British Challenger 1 achieved the longest range confirmed tank kill of the war, destroying an Iraqi tank with an armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot (APFSDS) round fired over —the longest tank-on-tank kill shot recorded.

==Casualties==

===Civilian===

Over 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians were killed by Iraqis. More than 600 Kuwaitis went missing during Iraq&#x27;s occupation, and approximately 375 remains were found in mass graves in Iraq. The increased importance of air attacks from both coalition warplanes and cruise missiles led to controversy over the number of civilian deaths caused during Desert Storm&#x27;s initial stages. Within Desert Storm&#x27;s first 24 hours, more than 1,000 sorties were flown, many against targets in Baghdad. The city was the target of heavy bombing, as it was the seat of power for Saddam and the Iraqi forces&#x27; command and control. This ultimately led to civilian casualties.

In one noted incident, two USAF stealth planes bombed a bunker in Amiriyah, causing the deaths of 408 Iraqi civilians in the shelter. Scenes of burned and mutilated bodies were subsequently broadcast, and controversy arose over the bunker&#x27;s status, with some stating that it was a civilian shelter, while others contended that it was a center of Iraqi military operations, and that the civilians had been deliberately moved there to act as human shields.

Saddam&#x27;s government gave high civilian casualty to draw support from Islamic countries. The Iraqi government claimed that 2,300 civilians died during the air campaign. According to the Project on Defense Alternatives study, 3,664 Iraqi civilians were killed in the conflict.

During the nationwide uprisings against the Ba&#x27;athist Iraqi government that directly followed the end of the Gulf War in March and April, an estimated 25,000 to 100,000 Iraqis were killed, overwhelmingly civilians.

A Harvard University study released in June 1991 predicted that there would be tens of thousands of additional Iraqi civilian deaths by the end of 1991 due to the &quot;public health catastrophe&quot; caused by the destruction of the country&#x27;s electrical generating capacity. &quot;Without electricity, hospitals cannot function, perishable medicines spoil, water cannot be purified and raw sewage cannot be processed,&quot;. The US government refused to release its own study of the effects of the Iraqi public health crisis.

An investigation in 1992 by Beth Osborne Daponte estimated about 13,000 civilians were directly killed in the war, while another 70,000 died indirectly from the war&#x27;s other effects. According to a 1992 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine by researchers known as the International Study Team (IST), child mortality increased threefold as a result of the war, with 46,900 children under the age of 5 dying between January and August 1991. However, these figures have been challenged by a 2017 study published in The BMJ, which stated that the &quot;IST survey probably understated the level of child mortality that prevailed during 1985–1990 and overstated the level during 1991.&quot; According to this study, &quot;there was no major rise in child mortality in Iraq after 1990&quot;. A report published in 2002 by Medact estimated the total number of Iraqi deaths caused directly and indirectly by the Gulf War to be between 142,500 and 206,000, including 100,000–120,000 military deaths, and 20,000–35,000 civilian deaths in the civil war and 15,000–30,000 refugee deaths after the end of the Gulf war.

Iraq also launched numerous attacks on civilian targets in Israel and Saudi Arabia. A 1991 report by Middle East Watch said that at least one Saudi civilian was killed after they were hit by Iraqi shelling in Riyadh. A disputed number of people were also killed during the Iraqi rocket attacks on Israel.

===Iraqi===

A United Nations report in March 1991 described the effect on Iraq of the US-led bombing campaign as &quot;near apocalyptic&quot;, bringing back Iraq to the &quot;pre-industrial age.&quot; The exact number of Iraqi combat casualties is unknown, but is believed to have been heavy. Some estimate that Iraq sustained between 20,000 and 35,000 fatalities. A report commissioned by the US Air Force estimated 10,000–12,000 Iraqi combat deaths in the air campaign, and as many as 10,000 casualties in the ground war. This analysis is based on Iraqi prisoner of war reports.

According to the Project on Defense Alternatives study, between 20,000 and 26,000 Iraqi military personnel were killed in the conflict while 75,000 others were wounded.

According to Kanan Makiya, &quot;For the Iraqi people, the cost of enforcing the will of the United Nations has been grotesque.&quot; General Schwarzkopf talked about &quot;a very, very large number of dead in these units, a very, very large number indeed.&quot; The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Les Aspin, estimated that &quot;at least 65,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed&quot;. A figure was supported by Israeli sources who speak of &quot;one to two hundred thousand Iraqi casualties.&quot; Most of the killing &quot;took place during the ground war. Fleeing soldiers were bombed with a device known as a &#x27;fuel-air explosive.&#x27;&quot;

===Coalition===


The US Department of Defense reports that US forces suffered 148 battle-related deaths (35 to friendly fire), with one pilot listed as MIA (his remains were found and identified in August 2009). A further 145 Americans died in non-combat accidents. The UK suffered 47 deaths (nine to friendly fire, all by US forces), France nine, and the other countries, not including Kuwait, suffered 37 deaths (18 Saudis, one Egyptian, six UAE and three Qataris). At least 605 Kuwaiti soldiers were still missing 10 years after their capture.

The largest single loss of life among coalition forces happened on 25 February 1991, when an Iraqi Al Hussein missile hit a US military barrack in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 28 US Army Reservists from Pennsylvania. In all, 190 coalition troops were killed by Iraqi fire during the war, 113 of whom were American, out of 358 coalition deaths. Another 44 soldiers were killed and 57 wounded by friendly fire. 145 soldiers died of exploding munitions or non-combat accidents.

The largest accident among coalition forces happened on 21 March 1991, when a Royal Saudi Air Force C-130H crashed in heavy smoke on approach to Ras Al-Mishab Airport, Saudi Arabia. 92 Senegalese soldiers and six Saudi crew members were killed.

The number of coalition wounded in combat was 776, including 458 Americans.

190 coalition troops were killed by Iraqi combatants, the rest of the 379 coalition deaths were from friendly fire or accidents. This number was much lower than expected. Among the American combat dead were four female soldiers.

====Friendly fire====
While the death toll among coalition forces engaging Iraqi combatants was very low, a substantial number of deaths were caused by accidental attacks from other Allied units. Of the 148 US troops who died in battle, 24% were killed by friendly fire, a total of 35 service personnel. A further 11 died in detonations of coalition munitions. Nine British military personnel were killed in a friendly fire incident when a USAF A-10 Thunderbolt II destroyed a group of two Warrior IFVs.

==Aftermath==
===Gulf War illness===

Many returning coalition soldiers reported illnesses following their action in the war, a phenomenon known as Gulf War syndrome (GWS) or Gulf War illness (GWI). Common symptoms reported are chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, and gastrointestinal disorder. There has been widespread speculation and disagreement about the causes of the illness and the possibly related birth defects. Researchers found that infants born to male veterans of the 1991 war had higher rates of two types of heart valve defects. Some children born after the war to Gulf War veterans had a certain kidney defect that was not found in Gulf War veterans&#x27; children born before the war. Researchers have said that they did not have enough information to link birth defects with exposure to toxic substances.

In 1994, the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs with Respect to Export Administration published a report entitled, &quot;U.S. Chemical and Biological Warfare-Related Dual Use Exports to Iraq and their Possible Impact on the Health Consequences of the Gulf War&quot;. This publication, called the Riegle Report, summarized testimony this committee had received establishing that the U.S. had in the 1980s supplied Saddam Hussein with chemical and biological warfare technology, that Saddam had used such chemical weapons against Iran and his own native Kurds, and possibly against U.S. soldiers as well, plausibly contributing to the GWS.

A 2022 study by Dr. Robert W. Haley of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, &quot;et al.&quot;, of 1,016 U.S. Gulf War veterans found evidence of a causal link between GWS and exposure to low levels of the nerve agent sarin, which was released into the air by coalition bombing of Iraqi chemical weapons facilities. Significantly, the study found an increased incidence of GWS not only among veterans who recounted hearing nerve agent alarms, but also among veterans with the RR or QR (as opposed to the QQ) forms of the PON1 gene, which produces an enzyme that deactivates organophosphates (including sarin) through hydrolysis. By contrast, GWS was &quot;inversely&quot; associated with higher levels of the type Q isozyme, which is more efficient at breaking down sarin than its type R counterpart. The authors &quot;found that the PON1 genotype and hearing nerve agent alarms were independent and the findings robust to both measured and unmeasured confounding, supporting a mechanistic [gene–environment] interaction. ... Moreover, the change in the combined effect from one category to the next was significantly greater than the sum of the independent effects of the environmental exposure and the genotype&quot;.

===Effects of depleted uranium===

The US military used depleted uranium in tank kinetic energy penetrators and cannon ordnance. Significant controversy regarding the long term safety of depleted uranium exists, including claims of pyrophoric, genotoxic, and teratogenic heavy metal effects. Many have cited its use during the war as a contributing factor to a number of major health issues in veterans and in surrounding civilian populations, including in birth defects and child cancer rates. Scientific opinion on the risk is mixed. In 2004, Iraq had the highest mortality rate due to leukemia of any country.

Depleted uranium has 40% less radioactivity than natural uranium, but the negative effects should not be overlooked. Depleted uranium is not a significant health hazard unless it is taken into the body. External exposure to radiation from depleted uranium is generally not a major concern because the alpha particles emitted by its isotopes travel only a few centimeters in air or can be stopped by a sheet of paper. Also, the uranium-235 that remains in depleted uranium emits only a small amount of low-energy gamma radiation. However, if allowed to enter the body, depleted uranium, like natural uranium, has the potential for both chemical and radiological toxicity with the two important target organs being the kidneys and the lungs.

===Highway of Death===
In the night of 26–27 February 1991, some Iraqi forces began leaving Kuwait on the main highway north of Al Jahra in a column of some 1,400 vehicles. A patrolling E-8 Joint STARS aircraft observed the retreating forces and relayed the information to the DDM-8 air operations center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. These vehicles and the retreating soldiers were subsequently attacked by two A-10 aircraft, resulting in a stretch of highway strewn with debris—the Highway of Death. &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Maureen Dowd wrote, &quot;With the Iraqi leader facing military defeat, Mr. Bush decided that he would rather gamble on a violent and potentially unpopular ground war than risk the alternative: an imperfect settlement hammered out by the Soviets and Iraqis that world opinion might accept as tolerable.&quot;

Chuck Horner, Commander of US and allied air operations, has written:

=== Bulldozer assault===
Another incident during the war highlighted the question of large-scale Iraqi combat deaths. This was the &quot;bulldozer assault&quot;, wherein two brigades from the US 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) were faced with a large and complex trench network, as part of the heavily fortified &quot;Saddam Hussein Line&quot;. After some deliberation, they opted to use anti-mine plows mounted on tanks and combat earthmovers to simply plow over and bury alive the defending Iraqi soldiers. Not a single American was killed during the attack. Reporters were banned from witnessing the attack, near the neutral zone that touches the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Every American in the assault was inside an armored vehicle.

Patrick Day Sloyan of &quot;Newsday&quot; reported, &quot;Bradley Fighting Vehicles and Vulcan armored carriers straddled the trench lines and fired into the Iraqi soldiers as the tanks covered them with mounds of sand. &#x27;I came through right after the lead company,&#x27; [Col. Anthony] Moreno said. &#x27;What you saw was a bunch of buried trenches with peoples&#x27; arms and things sticking out of them. However, after the war, the Iraqi government said that only 44 bodies were found. In his book &quot;The Wars Against Saddam&quot;, John Simpson alleges that US forces attempted to cover up the incident. After the incident, the commander of the 1st Brigade said: &quot;I know burying people like that sounds pretty nasty, but it would be even nastier if we had to put our troops in the trenches and clean them out with bayonets.&quot; Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney did not mention the First Division&#x27;s tactics in an interim report to Congress on Operation Desert Storm. In the report, Cheney acknowledged that 457 enemy soldiers were buried during the ground war.

===Palestinian exodus from Kuwait===
A Palestinian exodus from Kuwait took place during and after the Gulf War. During the Gulf War, more than 200,000 Palestinians fled Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait due to harassment and intimidation by Iraqi security forces, in addition to getting fired from work by Iraqi authority figures in Kuwait. After the Gulf War, the Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait in 1991. Kuwait&#x27;s policy, which led to this exodus, was a response to alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the PLO with Saddam Hussein.

The Palestinians who fled Kuwait were Jordanian citizens. In 2013, 280,000 Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin lived in Kuwait. In 2012, 80,000 Palestinians (without Jordanian citizenship) lived in Kuwait.

Saudi Arabia expelled Yemeni workers after Yemen supported Saddam during the Gulf War.

===Coalition bombing of Iraq&#x27;s civilian infrastructure===
In the 23 June 1991 edition of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, reporter Bart Gellman wrote: 

In the Jan/Feb 1995 edition of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, French diplomat Eric Rouleau wrote: 

However, the UN subsequently spent billions rebuilding hospitals, schools, and water purification facilities throughout the country.

===Abuse of Coalition POWs===
During the conflict, coalition aircrew shot down over Iraq were displayed as prisoners of war on TV, most with visible signs of abuse. Amongst several testimonies to poor treatment, USAF Captain Richard Storr was allegedly tortured by Iraqis during the Persian Gulf War. Iraqi secret police broke his nose, dislocated his shoulder and punctured his eardrum. Royal Air Force Tornado crew John Nichol and John Peters have both alleged that they were tortured during this time. Nichol and Peters were forced to make statements against the war on television. Members of British Special Air Service Bravo Two Zero were captured while providing information about an Iraqi supply line of Scud missiles to coalition forces. Only one, Chris Ryan, evaded capture while the group&#x27;s other surviving members were violently tortured. Flight surgeon (later General) Rhonda Cornum was sexually assaulted by one of her captors after the Black Hawk helicopter in which she was riding was shot down while searching for a downed F-16 pilot.

===Operation Southern Watch===

Since the war, the US has had a continued presence of 5,000 troops stationed in Saudi Arabiaa figure that rose to 10,000 during the 2003 conflict in Iraq. Operation Southern Watch enforced the no-fly zones over southern Iraq set up after 1991; oil exports through the Persian Gulf&#x27;s shipping lanes were protected by the Bahrain-based US Fifth Fleet.

Since Saudi Arabia houses Mecca and Medina, Islam&#x27;s holiest sites, many Muslims were upset at the permanent military presence. The continued presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia after the war was one of the stated motivations behind the 11 September terrorist attacks, the Khobar Towers bombing, and the date chosen for the 1998 US embassy bombings (7 August), which was eight years to the day that US troops were sent to Saudi Arabia. Osama bin Laden interpreted the Islamic prophet Muhammad as banning the &quot;permanent presence of infidels in Arabia&quot;. In 1996, bin Laden issued a fatwa, calling for US troops to leave Saudi Arabia. In a December 1999 interview with Rahimullah Yusufzai, bin Laden said he felt that Americans were &quot;too near to Mecca&quot; and considered this a provocation to the entire Islamic world.

===Sanctions===
On 6 August 1990, after Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 661 which imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, providing for a full trade embargo, excluding medical supplies, food and other items of humanitarian necessity, these to be determined by the council&#x27;s sanctions committee. From 1991 until 2003, the effects of government policy and sanctions regime led to hyperinflation, widespread poverty and malnutrition.

During the late 1990s, the UN considered relaxing the sanctions imposed because of the hardships suffered by ordinary Iraqis. Studies dispute the number of people who died in south and central Iraq during the years of the sanctions.

===Draining of the Qurna Marshes===

The draining of the Qurna Marshes was an irrigation project in Iraq during and immediately after the war, to drain a large area of marshes in the Tigris–Euphrates river system. Formerly covering an area of around , the large complex of wetlands were nearly emptied of water, and the local Shi&#x27;ite population relocated, following the war and 1991 uprisings. By 2000, the United Nations Environment Programme estimated that 90% of the marshlands had disappeared, causing desertification of over .

The draining occurred in Iraq and to a smaller degree in Iran between the 1950s and 1990s to clear large areas of the marshes. Formerly covering an area of around , the large complex of wetlands was 90% drained before the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. The marshes are typically divided into three main sub-marshes, the Hawizeh, Central, and Hammar Marshes and all three were drained at different times for different reasons. Initial draining of the Central Marshes was intended to reclaim land for agriculture but later all three marshes would become a tool of war and revenge.

Many international organizations such as the UN Human Rights Commission, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, the Wetlands International, and Middle East Watch have described the project as a political attempt to force the Marsh Arabs out of the area through water diversion tactics.

===Oil spill===

On 23 January, Iraq dumped of crude oil into the Persian Gulf, causing the largest offshore oil spill in history at that time. It was reported as a deliberate natural resources attack to keep US Marines from coming ashore (&quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; had shelled Failaka Island during the war to reinforce the idea that there would be an amphibious assault attempt). About 30–40% of this came from allied raids on Iraqi coastal targets.

===Kuwaiti oil fires===

The Kuwaiti oil fires were caused by the Iraqi military setting fire to 700 oil wells as part of a scorched earth policy while retreating from Kuwait in 1991 after conquering the country but being driven out by coalition forces. The fires started in January and February 1991, and the last one was extinguished by November.

The resulting fires burned uncontrollably because of the dangers of sending in firefighting crews. Land mines had been placed in areas around the oil wells, and a military cleaning of the areas was necessary before the fires could be put out. Somewhere around of oil were lost each day. Eventually, privately contracted crews extinguished the fires, at a total cost of US$1.5 billion to Kuwait. By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately 10 months, causing widespread pollution.

==Cost==

The cost of the war to the United States was calculated by the US Congress in April 1992 to be $61.1 billion (equivalent to $ in ). About $52 billion of that amount was paid by other countries: $36 billion by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf; $16 billion by Germany and Japan (which sent no combat forces due to their constitutions). About 25% of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s contribution was paid with in-kind services to the troops, such as food and transportation. US troops represented about 74% of the combined force, and the global cost was therefore higher.

===Effect on developing countries===
Apart from the impact on Arab States of the Persian Gulf, the resulting economic disruptions after the crisis affected many states. The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) undertook a study in 1991 to assess the effects on developing states and the international community&#x27;s response. A briefing paper finalized on the day that the conflict ended draws on their findings which had two main conclusions: Many developing states were severely affected and while there has been a considerable response to the crisis, the distribution of assistance was highly selective.

The ODI factored in elements of &quot;cost&quot; which included oil imports, remittance flows, re-settlement costs, loss of export earnings and tourism. For Egypt, the cost totaled $1 billion, 3% of GDP. Yemen had a cost of $830 million, 10% of GDP, while it cost Jordan $1.8 billion, 32% of GDP.

International response to the crisis on developing states came with the channeling of aid through The Gulf Crisis Financial Co-ordination Group. They were 24 states, comprising most of the OECD countries plus some Gulf states: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait. The members of this group agreed to disperse $14 billion in development assistance.

The World Bank responded by speeding up the disbursement of existing project and adjustment loans. The International Monetary Fund adopted two lending facilitiesthe Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the Compensatory &amp; Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF). The European Community offered $2 billion in assistance.

==Media coverage==
US policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the Vietnam War. The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled &quot;Annex Foxtrot&quot;. Most of the press information came from briefings organized by the military. Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers. Those visits were always conducted in the presence of officers, and were subject to both prior approval by the military and censorship afterward. This was ostensibly to protect sensitive information from being revealed to Iraq. This policy was heavily influenced by the military&#x27;s experience with the Vietnam War, in which public opposition within the US grew throughout the war&#x27;s course. It was not only the limitation of information in the Middle East; media were also restricting what was shown about the war with more graphic depictions like Ken Jarecke&#x27;s image of a burnt Iraqi soldier being pulled from the American AP wire whereas in Europe it was given extensive coverage.

Two BBC journalists, John Simpson and Bob Simpson (no relation), defied their editors and remained in Baghdad to report on the war&#x27;s progress. They were responsible for a report which included an &quot;infamous cruise missile that travelled down a street and turned left at a traffic light.&quot;

Alternative media outlets provided views opposing the war. Deep Dish Television compiled segments from independent producers in the US and abroad, and produced a 10-hour series that was distributed internationally, called The Gulf Crisis TV Project. The series&#x27; first program &quot;War, Oil and Power&quot; was compiled and released in 1990, before the war broke out. &quot;News World Order&quot; was the title of another program in the series; it focused on the media&#x27;s complicity in promoting the war, as well as Americans&#x27; reactions to the media coverage.

Media watchdog group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) critically analyzed media coverage during the war in various articles and books, such as the 1991 &quot;Gulf War Coverage: The Worst Censorship was at Home&quot;.

==Technology and equipments==
Precision-guided munitions were heralded as key in allowing military strikes to be made with a minimum of civilian casualties compared to previous wars, although they were not used as often as more traditional, less accurate bombs. Specific buildings in downtown Baghdad could be bombed while journalists in their hotels watched cruise missiles fly by.

Precision-guided munitions amounted to approximately 7.4% of all bombs dropped by the coalition. Other bombs included cluster bombs, which disperse numerous submunitions, and daisy cutters, 15,000-pound bombs which can disintegrate everything within hundreds of yards.

Global Positioning System (GPS) units were relatively new at the time and were important in enabling coalition units to easily navigate across the desert. Since military GPS receivers were not available for most troops, many used commercially available units. To permit these to be used to best effect, the &quot;selective availability&quot; feature of the GPS system was turned off for the duration of Desert Storm, allowing these commercial receivers to provide the same precision as the military equipment.

Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) and satellite communication systems were also important. Two examples of this are the US Navy&#x27;s Grumman E-2 Hawkeye and the US Air Force&#x27;s Boeing E-3 Sentry. Both were used in command and control area of operations. These systems provided essential communications links between air, ground, and naval forces. It is one of several reasons coalition forces dominated the air war.

American-made color photocopiers were used to produce some of Iraq&#x27;s battle plans. Some of the copiers contained concealed high-tech transmitters that revealed their positions to American electronic warfare aircraft, leading to more precise bombings.

===Scud and Patriot missiles===

The role of Iraq&#x27;s Scud missiles featured prominently in the war. Scud is a tactical ballistic missile that the Soviet Union developed and deployed among the forward deployed Soviet Army divisions in East Germany.

Scud missiles utilize inertial guidance which operates for the duration that the engines operate. Iraq used Scud missiles, launching them into both Saudi Arabia and Israel. Some missiles caused extensive casualties, while others caused little damage.

The US Patriot missile was used in combat for the first time. The US military claimed a high effectiveness against Scuds at the time, but later analysis gives figures as low as 9%, with 45% of the 158 Patriot launches being against debris or false targets. The Dutch Ministry of Defense, which also sent Patriot missiles to protect civilians in Israel and Turkey, later disputed the higher claim. Further, there is at least one incident of a software error causing a Patriot missile&#x27;s failure to engage an incoming Scud, resulting in deaths. Both the US Army and the missile manufacturers maintained the Patriot delivered a &quot;miracle performance&quot; in the Gulf War.

==In popular culture==
The Gulf War has been the subject of several video games including &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gulf War: Operation Desert Hammer&quot;, and &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&quot;. There have also been numerous depictions in film including &quot;Jarhead&quot; (2005), which is based on US Marine Anthony Swofford&#x27;s 2003 memoir of the same name. The 2016 Bollywood movie &quot;Airlift&quot; is based on 1990 airlift of Indians from Kuwait, the evacuation of Indian citizens stranded in Kuwait during the Gulf War.

<doc id="182001" wikidata="Q16843725" url="?curid=182001" title="History of Saxony-Anhalt">
<text>The history of Saxony-Anhalt began with Old Saxony, which was conquered by Charlemagne in 804 and transformed into the Duchy of Saxony within the Carolingian Empire. Saxony went on to become one of the so-called stem duchies of the German Kingdom and subsequently the Holy Roman Empire which formed out of the eastern partition of the Carolingian Empire. The duchy grew to become a powerful state within the empire, ruling over much of what is now northern Germany, but following conflicts with the emperor it was partitioned into numerous minor states, including the Principality of Anhalt, around the end of the 12th century and early 13th century. The territories of the Duchy of Saxony, the Principality of Anhalt, and their successors are now part of the modern German state of Saxony-Anhalt.

The ducal title and electoral dignity passed to the Ascanian Bernhard of Anhalt, but the title only came with a few small eastern parts of the former territory. Following his death in 1212 his possessions were divided between his sons: Henry established Anhalt as a county while Albert I took on the ducal title and the remaining possessions.

Anhalt was raised to a principality in 1218 but was divided in 1252 between Henry&#x27;s sons, forming Anhalt-Aschersleben, Anhalt-Bernburg and Anhalt-Zerbst. Over the centuries, numerous additional divisions and reunifications of the Anhalt territory took place, resulting in the creation of Anhalt-Köthen, Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-Pless and Anhalt-Plötzkau, as well as the recreation of several of the divisions; after 1252 it was only ruled as a single entity between 1570 and 1603.

Meanwhile, after Albert I&#x27;s death in 1260, the Duchy of Saxony was co-ruled by his sons John I and Albert II, and subsequently also by John I&#x27;s sons. However, the geographic separation of the territories – Wittenberg, Lauenburg and Hadeln – led to them being increasingly administered separately. In 1296 the duchy was officially separated into two separate duchies: John&#x27;s sons became rulers of Saxe-Lauenburg (which also included the Hadeln exclave) while Albert II became ruler of Saxe-Wittenberg. In addition to the duchy, Albert had acquired the County of Gommern in 1295, and in 1290 his son and heir Rudolph had been enfeoffed with the lands of the former County of Brehna on Wittenberg&#x27;s southern border. The status of the electoral dignity was contested by both lines until it was officially settled in Saxe-Wittenberg&#x27;s favour by the Golden Bull of 1356, after which time it became known as the Electorate of Saxony. In 1423 the Electorate was inherited by the Wettin Frederick I, who was also the Margrave of Meissen and Landgrave of Thuringia. Since Prince-elector was a higher rank than either landgrave or margrave, the whole of Frederick&#x27;s territory became known as the Electorate of Saxony; the lands around Wittenberg, Brehna and Gommern became known as the &quot;&quot; or &quot;Electoral Circle&quot;.

After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the remaining Anhalt divisions – Bernburg, Dessau and Köthen – were elevated to duchies by Napoleon while the Electorate of Saxony became a Kingdom; all were part of Napoleon&#x27;s Confederation of the Rhine until 1813.

In 1813 the Kingdom of Prussia occupied large amounts of Saxony&#x27;s territory in the Battle of Leipzig, including the Electoral Circle (which had been renamed the &quot;Wittenberg Circle&quot; in 1807); in May 1815 a treaty was signed in which Saxony ceded this territory to Prussia. In June 1815 they all became part of the German Confederation. In 1816 Prussia reorganised its annexed territory, merging it with the former Duchy of Magdeburg, Principality of Halberstadt, Principality of Erfurt, the Eichsfeld, and the former Imperial Cities of Mühlhausen and Nordhausen, along with the Altmark and other parts of Brandenburg west of the Elbe, into the Province of Saxony.

In 1863 the Anhalt duchies were finally reunited to form the Duchy of Anhalt. The duchy became part of the Prussian-led North German Confederation in 1867 and finally the German Empire in 1871.

Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, Anhalt became the Free State of Anhalt while the Province of Saxony continued as a constituent of the Free State of Prussia (both within the Weimar Republic). During Nazi rule, all of the previous subdivisions, including Anhalt and the Province of Saxony, ceased to exist &quot;de facto&quot; as they were replaced with &quot;&quot; in 1934.

After World War II what had been Anhalt and the Province of Saxony formed the basis of the occupying Soviet administration&#x27;s state (&#x27;) of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. Along with the other states of [[East Germany]], Saxony-Anhalt was dissolved in 1952 and replaced with various [[Administrative divisions of East Germany|districts]] (&#x27;); Saxony-Anhalt roughly corresponds to the former Magdeburg and Halle districts. However, the states, including Saxony-Anhalt, came back into being following German reunification in 1990, albeit with different borders than the original East German states.

== Duchy of Saxony ==

After Charlemagne&#x27;s conquest of the Saxons (772–804), their land was incorporated into the Carolingian empire, and late in the 9th century, it became the first Duchy of Saxony. It occupied nearly all the territory between the Elbe and Saale rivers to the east and the Rhine to the west; it bordered on Franconia and Thuringia in the south. It was itself divided into four provinces: Westphalia, Angria, Eastphalia, and Nordalbingia, with modern Saxony-Anhalt mostly lying within Eastphalia. Duke Henry I (Henry the Fowler) of Saxony was elected German king in 919, and his son, Emperor Otto I, bestowed (961) Saxony on Hermann Billung (d. 973), a Saxon nobleman, whose descendants held the duchy until the extinction of the male line in 1106. Lothair of Supplinburg bestowed it on his Guelphic son-in-law, Henry the Proud, who was already Duke of Bavaria.
In 1142 the duchy passed to Henry the Lion, son of Henry the Proud. The struggle between Henry the Lion and Emperor Frederick I ended with Henry&#x27;s loss of all his fiefs in 1180. The stem duchy was broken up into numerous fiefs. The Guelphic heirs of Henry the Lion retained only their allodial lands, the Duchy of Brunswick. The ducal title of Saxony went to Bernhard of Anhalt, a younger son of Albert the Bear of Brandenburg and founder of the Ascanian line of Saxon dukes. Besides Anhalt, Bernard received Lauenburg and the country around Wittenberg on the Elbe. These widely separate territories continued after 1260 under separate branches of the Ascanians as Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg.

== Electorate and Kingdom of Saxony ==
The Golden Bull of 1356 raised the Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg to the permanent rank of elector, with the right to participate in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor. Electoral Saxony, as his territory was called, was a relatively small area along the middle Elbe. Extending to the south of Electoral Saxony was the Margraviate of Meissen, ruled by the increasingly powerful house of Wettin. The margraves of Meissen acquired (13th–14th century) the larger parts of Thuringia, Lower Lusatia and the intervening territories, and in 1423 Margrave Frederick the Warlike added Electoral Saxony; in 1425 he became Elector Frederick I. Thus, Saxony shifted to east-central and east Germany from northwest Germany.

In 1485 the Wettin lands were partitioned between two sons of Elector Frederick II; the division came to be permanent. Ernest, founder of the Ernestine branch of Wettin, received Electoral Saxony with Wittenberg and most of the Thuringian lands. Albert, founder of the Albertine branch, received a ducal rank and the Meissen territories, including Dresden and Leipzig. Duke Maurice of Saxony, a grandson of Albert and a Protestant, received the electoral title in the 16th century; it remained in the Albertine branch until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.

The rivalry between Saxony and Brandenburg (after 1701 the kingdom of Prussia) was a decisive factor in later Saxon history, as was the election in 1697 of Augustus II (who was Frederick Augustus I as Elector of Saxony) as King of Poland; the election led to an economic partnership between the declining Poland and Saxony, whose prestige was thereby diminished. In the War of the Austrian Succession, Saxony adhered to what had become its traditional wavering policy, changing sides in the middle of the conflict. The death in 1763 of Augustus III ended the union with Poland.

The period of Saxon rule in Poland marked a time of economic and social decay but also of cultural and artistic flowering. Augustus II and Augustus III were lavish patrons of art and learning and greatly beautified their capital, Dresden. The universities of Wittenberg and Leipzig had long been leading intellectual centers, and 18th-century Leipzig led in the rise of German literature as well as in music, which reached its first peak with Bach.

Saxony sided with Prussia against France early in the French Revolutionary Wars but changed sides in 1806. For this act its elector was raised to royal rank, becoming King Frederick Augustus I. His failure to change sides again before Napoleon&#x27;s fall cost him (1815) nearly half his kingdom at the Congress of Vienna. The Kingdom of Saxony lost Lower Lusatia, part of Upper Lusatia, and all its northern territory including Wittenberg and Merseburg to Prussia. Its principal remaining cities were Dresden, Leipzig, Chemnitz, and Plauen. The larger part of the territories ceded in 1815 was incorporated with several other Prussian districts into the Prussian province of Saxony, with Magdeburg as its capital. This was united after 1945 with Anhalt to form the state of Saxony-Anhalt and became part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1949. From 1952 to 1990 Saxony-Anhalt was divided into the East German districts of Halle and Magdeburg. In 1990, prior to German reunification, the districts were reintegrated as a state.

== Counts of Anhalt ==
During the 9th century, the greater part of Anhalt was included in the Duchy of Saxony. In the 12th century, it came under the rule of Albert the Bear, Margrave of Brandenburg. Albert was descended from Adalbert, Count of Ballenstedt, whose son Esico (d. 1059 or 1060) appears to have been the first to bear the title of Count of Anhalt. Esico&#x27;s grandson, Otto the Rich, Count of Ballenstedt, was the father of Albert the Bear, who united Anhalt with Brandenburg. When Albert died in 1170, his son Bernard I, who received the title of Duke of Saxony in 1180, became the first Count of Anhalt. Bernard I died in 1212, and Anhalt, separated from Saxony, passed to his son Henry, who in 1218 took the title of prince and was the real founder of the house of Anhalt. Henry is included among the Minnesingers in the Codex Manesse.

== Princes of Anhalt ==

On Henry&#x27;s death in 1252 his three sons partitioned the principality, founding the lines of Aschersleben, Bernburg and Zerbst. The family ruling in Aschersleben became extinct in 1315, and this district was subsequently incorporated into the neighbouring Bishopric of Halberstadt, thus dividing the territory of Anhalt-Bernburg into two separate pieces. The last prince of the original line of Anhalt-Bernburg died in 1468 and his lands were inherited by the princes of the sole remaining line, that of Anhalt-Zerbst. The territory belonging to this branch of the family had been divided in 1396, and after the acquisition of Bernburg, Prince George I made a further partition of Zerbst (Zerbst and Dessau). Early in the 16th century, owing to the death or abdication of several princes, the family had narrowed down to the two branches of Anhalt-Köthen and Anhalt-Dessau (both issued from Anhalt-Dessau in 1471).

Wolfgang of Anhalt, called &quot;The Confessor&quot;, who became prince of Anhalt-Köthen in 1508, was the second ruler in the world to introduce the Reformation in his territory. He was a co-signer of the Augsburg Confession in 1530, and after the Battle of Mühlberg in 1547 was placed under Imperial ban and deprived of his lands by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. After the peace of Passau in 1552 he bought back his principality, but as he was childless he surrendered it in 1562 to his kinsmen, the princes of Anhalt-Dessau. Ernest I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau (d. 1516), left three sons, John II, George III, and Joachim, who jointly ruled their lands for many years and favoured the reformed doctrines, which thus became dominant in Anhalt. About 1546 the three brothers divided their principality and founded the lines of Zerbst, Plötzkau and Dessau. This division, however, was only temporary, as the acquisition of Köthen, and a series of deaths among the ruling princes, enabled Joachim Ernest, a son of John II, to unite the whole of Anhalt under his rule in 1570.

Joachim Ernest died in 1586, and his five sons ruled the land in common until 1603, when Anhalt was again divided, and the lines of Dessau, Bernburg, Plötzkau, Zerbst, and Köthen were re-established. The principality was ravaged during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and in the earlier part of this struggle Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg took an important part. In 1635 an arrangement was made by the various princes of Anhalt to authorize the eldest member of the family to represent the principality as a whole. This action was probably due to the necessity of maintaining an appearance of unity in view of the disturbed state of European politics at the time.

In 1665 the Anhalt-Köthen branch became extinct, and according to a family compact, this district was inherited by Lebrecht, Prince of Anhalt-Plötzkau, who surrendered Plötzkau to Bernburg and took the title of prince of Anhalt-Köthen. In the same year the princes of Anhalt decided that if any branch of the family became extinct its lands should be equally divided among the remaining branches. This arrangement was carried out after the death of Frederick Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, in 1793, and Zerbst was divided between the three remaining princes. During these years the policy of the different princes was marked, perhaps intentionally, by considerable uniformity. Once or twice Calvinism was favoured by one of the princes, but in general, the house was loyal to the doctrines of Martin Luther. The growth of Prussia provided Anhalt with a formidable neighbour, and the establishment and practice of primogeniture by all branches of the family prevented the further division of the principality.

== 19th century duchies ==

In 1806 Napoleon elevated the remaining states of Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-Dessau, and Anhalt-Köthen to duchies. (Anhalt-Plötzkau and Anhalt-Zerbst had in the meantime ceased to exist.) These duchies were united in 1863 to form a single Duchy of Anhalt, again due to the extinction of the Köthen and Bernburg lines. The new duchy consisted of two large portions: Eastern and Western Anhalt, separated by the interposition of a part of the Prussian Province of Saxony, and five exclaves surrounded by Prussian territory, namely Alsleben, Muhlingen, Dornburg, Goednitz and Tilkerode-Abberode. The eastern and larger portion of the duchy was enclosed by the Prussian government district of Potsdam (in the Prussian province of Brandenburg), and Magdeburg and Merseburg (belonging to the Prussian province of Saxony). The smaller western part (the so-called Upper Duchy or Ballenstedt) was also enclosed by the two latter districts as well as by the duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

The capital of Anhalt (whenever it was a united state) was Dessau.

In 1918 Anhalt became a state within the Weimar Republic (see Free State of Anhalt). After World War II it was united with the former Prussian province of Saxony, forming the new state of Saxony-Anhalt. The state was dissolved in 1952 by the German Democratic Republic government, but was re-established prior to German reunification and is now one of the German .

== State of Saxony-Anhalt ==
Saxony-Anhalt was formed as a province of Prussia in 1945, from the territories of the former Prussian Province of Saxony (except the &quot;&quot; Erfurt), the Free State of Anhalt, the Free State of Brunswick (Calvörde and the eastern part of the former Blankenburg district) and the formerly Thuringian town Allstedt. See the respective articles for the history of the area before 1945.

When Prussia was disbanded in 1947, the province became the state of Saxony-Anhalt. It became part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1949. From 1952 to 1990 Saxony-Anhalt was divided into the East German districts of Halle and Magdeburg. In 1990, in the course of German reunification, the districts were reintegrated as a state.

== Geography ==
The land is undulating in the west and mountainous in the extreme north-west, where it forms part of the Harz range, the Ramberg peak marking the highest elevation at 1900  ft (579 m). From the Harz, the country gently shelves down to the Saale and is fertile between this river and the Elbe. East of the Elbe, the land is mostly a flat sandy plain, with extensive pine forests, interspersed with bog-land and rich pastures. The Elbe is the chief river, intersecting the eastern portion of the former duchy from east to west and joining the Mulde at Rosslau. The navigable Saale takes a northerly direction through the central portion of the territory and receives, on the right, the Fuhne and, on the left, the Wipper and Bode rivers.

The climate is generally mild, less so in the higher regions to the south-west. The area of the former duchy is 906 sq mi (2300 km2), and the population in 1905 was 328,007, a ratio of about 351/sq mi (909/km2).

== Political and religious structure of Anhalt in 1911 ==
As of 1911, Anhalt was divided into the districts of Dessau, Köthen, Zerbst, Bernburg and Ballenstedt, Bernburg being the most populous and Ballenstedt the least. Four towns – Dessau, Bernburg, Köthen, and Zerbst – had populations exceeding 20,000. The inhabitants of the former duchy, who mainly belonged to the upper Saxon race, were, with the exception of about 12,000 Roman Catholics and 1,700 Jews, members of the Evangelical Church of the Union. The supreme ecclesiastical authority was the consistory in Dessau. A synod of 39 members, elected for six years, assembled periodically to deliberate on internal matters pertaining to the organization of the church. The Roman Catholics were under the bishop of Paderborn.

By virtue of a fundamental law proclaimed on September 17, 1859, and subsequently modified by various decrees, the duchy was a constitutional monarchy. The duke bore the title of &quot;Highness&quot; and wielded the executive power while sharing legislative powers with the estates. The diet (Landtag) was composed of thirty-six members, of whom two were appointed by the duke, eight were representatives of landowners paying the highest taxes, two were chosen from among the highest assessed members of the commercial and manufacturing classes, fourteen were electors of the towns and ten represented the rural districts. These representatives were chosen for six years by indirect vote and had to be at least 25 years of age. The duke governed through a minister of state, who was the head of all the departments: finance, home affairs, education, public worship, and statistics.

<doc id="182007" wikidata="Q653703" url="?curid=182007" title="List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)">
<text>The Holy Roman Empire was a highly decentralized state for most of its history, composed of hundreds of smaller states, most of which operated with some degree of independent sovereignty. Although in the earlier part of the Middle Ages, under the Salian and Hohenstaufen emperors, it was relatively centralized, as time went on the Emperor lost more and more power to the Princes. The membership of the Imperial Diet in 1792, late in the Empire&#x27;s history but before the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars, gives some insight as to the composition of the Holy Roman Empire at that time.

==Structure of the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire in 1792==
The year 1792 was just before the vast changes inspired by the French Revolutionary incursions into Germany. The empire was, at that time, divided into several thousand immediate (&quot;unmittelbar&quot;) territories, but only about three hundred of these had &quot;Landeshoheit&quot; (the special sort of quasi-sovereignty enjoyed by the states of the Empire), and had representation in the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire (German &quot;Reichstag&quot;). The Imperial Diet was divided into three so-called &quot;collegia&quot;—the Council of Electors, the Council of Princes, and the Council of Cities. As those who received votes had gradually changed over the centuries, many princes held more than one vote. Certain territories which had once held votes in the Diet, as for instance the County of Waldeck or the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, no longer retained them, due to the extinction of a dynasty or other causes.

===The Council of Electors===
The council included the following eight members:
* The King of Bohemia (also Archduke of Austria and King of Hungary) (Emperor Leopold II)
* The Archbishop of Mainz (Frederick Charles Joseph of Erthal)
* The Archbishop of Trier (Clement Wenceslaus of Saxony)
* The Archbishop of Cologne (Maximilian Francis of Austria)
* The Count Palatine of the Rhine (also Duke of Bavaria) (Charles IV Theodore)
* The Duke of Saxony (Frederick Augustus III)
* The Margrave of Brandenburg (King of Prussia) (Frederick William II)
* The Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Elector of Hanover, King of Great Britain) (George III)

===The Council of Princes===
This is ordered based on the official order of voting in the Diet:
* The Archduke of Austria (also King of Bohemia) (Emperor Leopold II)
* The Duke of Burgundy (also Archduke of Austria) (Emperor Leopold II)

====The Ecclesiastical Bench====

* The Bishop of Liège (Prince-Bishop César-Constantin-François de Hoensbroeck)
* The Bishop of Lübeck (a Protestant bishopric) (Peter Friedrich Ludwig of Holstein-Gottorp)
* The Bishop of Chur (Franz Dionysius von Rost)
* The Bishop of Fulda (Adalbert von Harstall)
* The Abbot of Kempten (Ruprecht von Neuenstein)
* The Provost of Ellwangen (Clemens Wenzeslaus of Saxony, the Elector of Trier)

<text>A public library is a library, most often a lending library, that is accessible by the general public and is usually funded from public sources, such as taxes. It is operated by librarians and library paraprofessionals, who are also civil servants.

There are five fundamental characteristics shared by public libraries:
# they are generally supported by taxes (usually local, though any level of government can and may contribute);
# they are governed by a board to serve the public interest;
# they are open to all, and every community member can access the collection;
# they are entirely voluntary, no one is ever forced to use the services provided; and
# they provide library and information services without charge.

Public libraries exist in many countries across the world and are often considered an essential part of having an educated and literate population. Public libraries are distinct from research libraries, school libraries, academic libraries in other states and other special libraries. Their mandate is to serve the general public&#x27;s information needs rather than the needs of a particular school, institution, or research population. Public libraries also provide free services such as preschool story times to encourage early literacy among children. They also provide a quiet study and learning areas for students and professionals and foster the formation of book clubs to encourage the appreciation of literature by the young and adults. Public libraries typically allow users to borrow books and other materials outside the library premises temporarily, usually for a given period of time. They also have non-circulating reference collections and provide computer and Internet access to their patrons.

==Overview==
The culmination of centuries of advances in the printing press, moveable type, paper, ink, publishing, and distribution, combined with an ever-growing information-oriented middle class, increased commercial activity and consumption, new radical ideas, massive population growth and higher literacy rates forged the public library into the form that it is today.

Public access to books is not new. Romans made scrolls in dry rooms available to patrons of the baths, and tried with some success to establish libraries within the empire. Public libraries existed in the Roman Empire by the 1st century BC.

In the middle of the 19th century, the push for truly public libraries, paid for by taxes and run by the state gained force. Matthew Battles states that:
It was in these years of class conflict and economic terror that the public library movement swept through Britain, as the nation&#x27;s progressive elite recognized that the light of cultural and intellectual energy was lacking in the lives of commoners.

Public libraries were often started with a donation, or were bequeathed to parishes, churches, schools or towns. These social and institutional libraries formed the base of many academic and public library collections of today.

The establishment of circulating libraries in the 18th century by booksellers and publishers provided a means of gaining profit and creating social centers within the community. The circulating libraries not only provided a place to sell books, but also a place to lend books for a price. These circulating libraries provided a variety of materials including the increasingly popular novels. Although the circulating libraries filled an important role in society, members of the middle and upper classes often looked down upon these libraries that regularly sold material from their collections and provided materials that were less sophisticated.

Circulating libraries also charged a subscription fee. However, these fees were set to entice their patrons, providing subscriptions on a yearly, quarterly or monthly basis, without expecting the subscribers to purchase a share in the circulating library. This helped patrons who could not afford to buy books, to be able to borrow books to read, and then return. This also created a more popular demand, as book fees were growing, and more books were being copied. Circulating libraries were very popular; the first one was located in 1725, in Edinburgh, Scotland, by Allan Ramsay.

Circulating libraries were not exclusively lending institutions and often provided a place for other forms of commercial activity, which may or may not be related to print. This was necessary because the circulating libraries did not generate enough funds through subscription fees collected from its borrowers. As a commerce venture, it was important to consider the contributing factors such as other goods or services available to the subscribers.

The Malatestiana Library (), also known as the Malatesta Novello Library, is a public library dating from 1452 in Cesena, Emilia-Romagna (Italy). It was the first European civic library, i.e. belonging to the Commune and open to everybody. It was commissioned by the Lord of Cesena, Malatesta Novello. The works were directed by Matteo Nuti of Fano (a scholar of Leon Battista Alberti) and lasted from 1447 to 1452.

==History==

===Early history===
The first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing – the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in temple rooms in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC. They appeared five thousand years ago in Southwest Asia&#x27;s Fertile Crescent, an area that ran from Mesopotamia to the Nile in Africa. Known as the cradle of civilization, the Fertile Crescent was likewise the birthplace of writing, sometime before 3000 BC. (Murray, Stuart A.P.) These first libraries, which mainly consisted of the records of commercial transactions or inventories, mark the end of prehistory and the start of history.

Things were very similar in the government and temple records on papyrus of Ancient Egypt. The earliest discovered private archives were kept at Ugarit; besides correspondence and inventories, texts of myths may have been standardized practice-texts for teaching new scribes.

Persia at the time of the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC) was home to some outstanding libraries that were serving two main functions: keeping the records of administrative documents (e.g., transactions, governmental orders, and budget allocation within and between the Satrapies and the central ruling State) and collection of resources on different sets of principles e.g. medical science, astronomy, history, geometry and philosophy.

A public library was established in Rome by the first century BC, in the Atrium Libertatis (see and ). However, the first major public library is said to have been established in Athens by Pisistratus in the sixth century BC (see ), and by the end of the Hellenistic period, public libraries are said to have been widespread in the Eastern Mediterranean (see ).

Historian Yahya of Antioch (d. 1066) reported that the Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah () financed and established libraries open to the public, where anyone, even the simple non-specialists, could choose whatever books they wanted and have them copied by public scribes, free of charge. However, as with many of his other decisions, Al-Hakim later ordered this policy to be reversed.

In Cesena, Italy, the first community-run public library, the Malatestiana Library, was established in 1447, provided both secular and religious texts in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and was fully open to all members of the public.

Another early library that allowed access to the public was Kalendars or Kalendaries, a brotherhood of clergy and laity who were attached to the Church of All-Halloween or All Saints in Bristol, England. Records show that in 1464, provision was made for a library to be erected in the house of the Kalendars. A reference is made to a deed of that date by which it was &quot;appointed that all who wish to enter for the sake of instruction shall have &#x27;free access and recess&#x27; at certain times.&quot;

In 1598, Francis Trigge established a library in a room above St. Wulfram&#x27;s Church in Grantham, Lincolnshire and decreed that it should be open to the clergy and residents of the surrounding neighborhood. Some scholars consider this library an &quot;ancestor&quot; to public libraries since its patrons did not need to belong to an existing organization like a church or college to use it. However, all the books in the library were chained to stalls and unavailable to borrow, hence its name: the Francis Trigge Chained Library.
In the early years of the 17th century, many famous collegiate and town libraries were founded in England. Norwich City library was established in 1608 (six years after Thomas Bodley founded the Bodleian Library, which was open to the &quot;whole republic of the learned&quot;) and Chetham&#x27;s Library in Manchester, which claims to be the oldest public library in the English-speaking world, opened in 1653.

Biblioteca Palafoxiana in Puebla City, Mexico, is recognized by UNESCO for being the first public library in the Americas. It was founded in 1646 by Juan de Palafox y Mendoza. 
In his seminal work (1644) the French scholar and librarian Gabriel Naudé asserted that only three libraries in all Europe granted in his times regular access to every scholar, namely the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, the in Rome, and the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

===Enlightenment-era libraries===
Claude Sallier, the French philologist and churchman, operated an early form of a public library in the town of Saulieu from 1737 to 1750. He wished to make culture and learning accessible to all people.

The Załuski Library (, ) was built in Warsaw 1747–1795 by Józef Andrzej Załuski and his brother, Andrzej Stanisław Załuski, both Roman Catholic bishops. The library was open to the public and was the first Polish public library, the biggest in Poland, and one of the earliest public libraries in Europe.

At the start of the 18th century, libraries were becoming increasingly public and were more frequently lending libraries. The 18th century saw the switch from closed parochial libraries to lending libraries. Before this time, public libraries were parochial in nature, and libraries frequently chained their books to desks. Libraries also were not uniformly open to the public. In 1790, The Public Library Act would not be passed for another sixty-seven years.
Even though the British Museum existed at this time and contained over 50,000 books, the national library was not open to the public or even to most of the population. Access to the museum depended on passes, for which there was sometimes a waiting period of three to four weeks. Moreover, the library was not open for browsing. Once a pass to the library had been issued, the reader was taken on a tour of the library. Many readers complained that the tour was much too short. Similarly, the Bibliothèque du Roi in Paris required a potential visitor to be &quot;carefully screened&quot; and, even after this stipulation was met, the library was open only two days per week and only to view medallions and engravings, not books.

However, up until the mid-19th century, there were virtually no public libraries in the sense in which we now understand the term, i.e., libraries provided with public funds and freely accessible to all. Only one important library in Britain, namely Chetham&#x27;s Library in Manchester, was fully and freely accessible to the public. The Chesshyre Library in Halton, Cheshire was founded as a free public library in 1733 for all &quot;divines of the Church of England or other gentlemen or persons of letters&quot;, but it was limited to just 422 volumes of mostly ecclesiastical and legal works. In Germany, there was another occurrence of an accessible public library. The Ducal Library at Wolfenbüttel was open &quot;every weekday morning and afternoon&quot; and loaned its books to the public. Between 1714 and 1799, the library loaned 31,485 books to 1,648 different users. These types of public libraries, much closer to the present-day concept of the public library, were extremely rare as most libraries remained difficult to access.

The increase in secular literature at this time encouraged the spread of lending libraries, especially commercial subscription libraries. Commercial subscription libraries began when booksellers began renting out extra copies of books in the mid-18th century. Steven Fischer estimates that in 1790, there were &quot;about six hundred rental and lending libraries, with a clientele of some fifty thousand.&quot; The mid-to-late 18th century saw a virtual epidemic of feminine reading as novels became more and more popular. Novels, while frowned upon in society, were extremely popular. In England, there were many who lamented at the &quot;villainous profane and obscene books&quot;, and the opposition to the circulating library, on moral grounds, persisted well into the 19th century. Still, many establishments must have circulated many times the number of novels as of any other genre.

In 1797, Thomas Wilson wrote in &quot;The Use of Circulating Libraries&quot;: &quot;Consider that for a successful circulating library, the collection must contain 70% fiction&quot;. However, the overall percentage of novels mainly depended on the proprietor of the circulating library. While some circulating libraries were almost completely novels, others had less than 10% of their overall collection in the form of novels. The national average start of the 20th century hovered around novels comprising about 20% of the total collection. Novels varied from other types of books in many ways. They were read primarily for enjoyment instead of for study. They did not provide academic knowledge or spiritual guidance; thus, they were read quickly and far fewer times than other books. These were the perfect books for commercial subscription libraries to lend. Since books were read for pure enjoyment rather than for scholarly work, books needed to become both cheaper and smaller. Small duodecimo editions of books were preferred to the large folio editions. Folio editions were read at a desk, while the small duodecimo editions could be easily read like the paperbacks of today. The French journalist Louis-Sébastien Mercier wrote that the books were also separated into parts so that readers could rent a section of the book for some hours instead of a full day. This allowed more readers could have access to the same work at the same time, making it more profitable for the circulating libraries.

Much like paperbacks of today, many of the novels in circulating libraries were unbound. At this period of time, many people chose to bind their books in leather. Many circulating libraries skipped this process. Circulating libraries were not in the business of preserving books; their owners wanted to lend books as many times as they possibly could. Circulating libraries have ushered in a completely new way of reading. Reading was no longer simply an academic pursuit or an attempt to gain spiritual guidance. Reading became a social activity. Many circulating libraries were attached to the shops of milliners or drapers. They served as much for social gossip and the meeting of friends as coffee shops do today.
Another factor in the growth of subscription libraries was the increasing cost of books. In the last two decades of the century, especially, prices were practically doubled, so that a quarto work cost a guinea, an octavo 10 shillings or 12 shillings, and a duodecimo cost 4 shillings per volume. Price apart, moreover, books were difficult to procure outside London since local booksellers could not afford to carry large stocks. Commercial libraries, since they were usually associated with booksellers and also since they had a greater number of patrons, were able to accumulate greater numbers of books. The United Public Library was said to have a collection of some 52,000 volumes – twice as many as any private-subscription library in the country at that period. These libraries, since they functioned as a business, also lent books to non-subscribers on a per-book system.

Despite the existence of these subscription libraries, they were only accessible to those who could afford the fees and to those with time to read during the daylight. As stated by James Van Horn Melton, &quot;one should not overstate the extent to which lending libraries &#x27;democratized&#x27; reading&quot; since &quot;they were probably less important for creating new readers than for enabling those who already read to read more.&quot; For many people, these libraries, though more accessible than libraries such as the British Library, were still largely an institution for the middle and upper classes.

=== India ===
In A.D 1820, the State Central Library, Kerala started functioning in Trivandrum, India, which is not only India&#x27;s first public library but also the first such institution outside of Europe. However, there had come into being a whole network of library provisions on a private or institutional basis. Subscription libraries, both private and commercial, provided the middle to upper classes with a variety of books for moderate fees.

===Private-subscription libraries===

Private-subscription libraries functioned in much the same manner as commercial subscription libraries, though they varied in many important ways. One of the most popular versions of the private-subscription library was the &quot;gentlemen only&quot; library. The gentlemen&#x27;s subscription libraries, sometimes known as proprietary libraries, were nearly all organized on a common pattern. Membership was restricted to the proprietors or shareholders, and ranged from a dozen or two to between four and five hundred. The entrance fee, i.e. the purchase price of a share, was in early days usually a guinea, but rose sharply as the century advanced, often reaching four or five guineas during the French wars; the annual subscription, during the same period, rose from about six shillings to ten shillings or more. The book-stock was, by modern standards, small (Liverpool, with over 8,000 volumes in 1801, seems to have been the largest), and was accommodated, at the outset, in makeshift premises—very often over a bookshop, with the bookseller acting as librarian and receiving an honorarium for his pains.

The Liverpool subscription library was a gentlemen-only library. In 1798, it was renamed the Athenaeum when it was rebuilt with a newsroom and coffeehouse. It had an entrance fee of one guinea and annual subscription of five shillings. An analysis of the registers for the first twelve years provides glimpses of middle-class reading habits in a mercantile community at this period. The largest and most popular sections of the library were History, Antiquities, and Geography, with 283 titles and 6,121 borrowings, and Belles Lettres, with 238 titles and 3,313 borrowings. The most popular single work was John Hawkesworth&#x27;s &quot;Account of Voyages ... in the Southern Hemisphere&quot; (3 vols) which was borrowed on 201 occasions. The records also show that in 1796, membership had risen by 1/3 to 198 subscribers (of whom 5 were women) and the titles increased five-fold to 4,987. This mirrors the increase in reading interests. A patron list from the Bath Municipal Library shows that from 1793 to 1799, the library held a stable 30% of their patrons as female.

It was also uncommon for these libraries to have buildings designated solely as the library building during the 1790s, though in the 19th century, many libraries would begin building elaborate permanent residences. Bristol, Birmingham, and Liverpool were the few libraries with their own building. The accommodations varied from the shelf for a few dozen volumes in the country stationer&#x27;s or draper&#x27;s shop, to the expansion to a back room, to the spacious elegant areas of Hookham&#x27;s or those at the resorts like Scarborough, and four in a row at Margate.

Private-subscription libraries held a greater amount of control over both membership and the types of books in the library. There was almost a complete elimination of cheap fiction in the private societies. Subscription libraries prided themselves on respectability. The highest percentage of subscribers were often landed proprietors, gentry, and old professions.

Towards the end of the 18th century and in the first decades of the 19th century, the demand for books and general education made itself felt among social classes generated by the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. The late-18th century saw a rise in subscription libraries intended for the use of tradesmen. In 1797, there was established at Kendal what was known as the Economical Library, &quot;designed principally for the use and instruction of the working classes.&quot; There was also the Artizans&#x27; library established at Birmingham in 1799. The entrance fee was 3 shillings, and the subscription was 1 shilling 6 pence per quarter. This was a library of general literature. Novels, at first excluded, were afterwards admitted on condition that they did not account for more than one-tenth of the annual income.

===19th–20th centuries===
====United Kingdom====
In 1835, and against government opposition, James Silk Buckingham, MP for Sheffield and a supporter of the temperance movement, was able to secure the Chair of the select committee which would examine &quot;the extent, causes, and consequences of the prevailing vice of intoxication among the labouring classes of the United Kingdom&quot; and propose solutions. Francis Place, a campaigner for the working class, agreed that &quot;the establishment of parish libraries and district reading rooms, and popular lectures on subjects both entertaining and instructive to the community might draw off a number of those who now frequent public houses for the sole enjoyment they afford&quot;. Buckingham introduced to Parliament a Public Institution Bill allowing boroughs to charge a tax to set up libraries and museums, the first of its kind. Although this did not become law, it had a major influence on William Ewart MP and Joseph Brotherton MP, who introduced a bill which would &quot;[empower] boroughs with a population of 10,000 or more to raise a ½d for the establishment of museums&quot;. This became the Museums Act 1845.

The advocacy of Ewart and Brotherton then succeeded in having a select committee set up to consider public library provision. The Report argued that the provision of public libraries would steer people towards temperate and moderate habits. With a view to maximising the potential of current facilities, the committee made two significant recommendations. They suggested that the government should issue grants to aid the foundation of libraries and that the Museums Act 1845 should be amended and extended to allow for a tax to be levied for the establishment of public libraries.

Objections were raised about the increase in taxation, the potential infringement on private enterprise and the existing library provision such as mechanics&#x27; institutes and the fear that it would give rise to &quot;unhealthy social agitation&quot;. The bill passed through Parliament as most MPs felt that public libraries would provide facilities for self-improvement through books and reading for all classes, and that the greater levels of education attained by providing public libraries would result in lower crime rates.

Under the terms of the Museums Act 1845, the municipalities of Warrington and Salford established libraries in their museums. Warrington Municipal Library opened in 1848.

Although by the mid-19th century, England could claim 274 subscription libraries and Scotland, 266, the foundation of the modern public library system in Britain is the Public Libraries Act 1850. The act first gave local boroughs the power to establish free public libraries and was the first legislative step toward the creation of an enduring national institution that provides universal free access to information and literature. In the 1830s, at the height of the Chartist movement, there was a general tendency towards reformism in the United Kingdom. The middle classes were concerned that the workers&#x27; free time was not being well-spent. This was prompted more by Victorian middle class paternalism than by demand from the lower social orders. Campaigners felt that encouraging the lower classes to spend their free time on morally uplifting activities, such as reading, would promote greater social good.

Salford Museum and Art Gallery first opened in November 1850 as &quot;The Royal Museum &amp; Public Library&quot;, as the first unconditionally free public library in England. The library in Campfield, Manchester was the first library to operate a &quot;free&quot; lending library without subscription in 1852. Norwich lays claim to being the first municipality to adopt the Public Libraries Act 1850 (which allowed any municipal borough with a population of 100,000 or more to introduce a halfpenny rate to establish public libraries—although not to buy books). Norwich was the eleventh library to open, in 1857, after Winchester, Manchester, Liverpool, Bolton, Kidderminster, Cambridge, Birkenhead and Sheffield.

The Public Libraries Act 1850 was noteworthy because it established the principle of free public libraries. In 1866, an amending act, the Public Libraries Amendment Act 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. 114) was passed which eliminated the population limit for the establishment of a library and replaced the two-thirds majority previously required for adoption with a simple majority. It also allowed neighbouring parishes to combine with an existing or potential library authority. Despite the rise in the level of tax public libraries could levy, it was still very difficult for boroughs to raise enough capital to fund new libraries. The growth of the public library movement in the wake of the 1850 act relied heavily on the donations of philanthropists.

County libraries were a later development, which were made possible by the establishment of county councils in 1888. They normally have a large central library in a major town with smaller branch libraries in other towns and a mobile library service covering rural areas.

The Public Libraries Act 1964 required local authorities to provide a &quot;comprehensive and efficient&quot; library service. Public libraries built in the 1960s were characterized by modernism. 

====United States====

The modern public library grew at a great pace at the end of the 19th century especially in the English-speaking world. Philanthropists and businessmen, including John Passmore Edwards, Henry Tate and Andrew Carnegie, helped to fund the establishment of large numbers of public libraries for the edification of the masses.

Public libraries in North America developed from the 18th century to today; as the country grew more populous and wealthier, factors such as a push for education and desire to share knowledge led to broad public support for free libraries. In addition, money donations by private philanthropists provided the seed capital to get many libraries started. In some instances, collectors donated large book collections.
The first modern public library in the world supported by taxes was the Peterborough Town Library in Peterborough, New Hampshire. It was &quot;established in 1833&quot;. This was a small public library. The first large public library supported by taxes in the United States was the Boston Public Library, which was established in 1848 but did not open its doors to the public until 1854.

The Redwood Library and Athenaeum was founded in 1747 by a group led by Abraham Redwood. It was the first library in Rhode Island and the oldest lending library in America. Over half of its volumes were lost when it was used as the British Officers Club during the Revolutionary War. An effort was made to replace the original collection. Over 90% of the volumes lost were returned. The library is still in use.

A total of 1,689 Carnegie libraries were built in the United States between 1883 and 1929, including some belonging to universities. By 1930, half the American public libraries had been built by Carnegie.

Federal library legislation supporting public libraries has been a focus of the American Library Association, Washington Office. 

Democracy within the life of libraries in the 20th and 21st century has been explored in the essay, &quot;Libraries, Democracy, and
Citizenship: Twenty Years after 9/11.&quot;
====Other countries====

The first public library in Australia was the Melbourne Public Library (now the State Library of Victoria), which opened in 1856, just a few years after their introduction into Britain. This was however purely a reference library. In September 1869, the New South Wales (NSW) government opened as the Free Public Library, Sydney (now the State Library of New South Wales) by purchasing a bankrupt subscription library. In 1896, the Brisbane Public Library was established. The library&#x27;s collection, purchased by the Queensland Government from the private collection of Justice Harding. In 1935 the &quot;Free Library Movement&quot; was established in New South Wales advocating for free public libraries to be supported by municipal authorities. A similar movement was established in Victoria within a couple of years.

&quot;New Zealand was, by the third quarter of the nineteenth century, a veritable paradise for readers, with the formation of public libraries following closely on the heels of the settlers as they spread across the country.&quot;

Pre-Independence libraries in India have been discussed by R.K. Bhatt and K. Kandhasamy.

Eugène Morel, a writer and one of the librarians at the Bibliothèque nationale, pioneered modern public libraries in France. He put forward his ideas in the 1910 book &quot;La Librairie publique&quot;.

Mexican public libraries trace their origins to convent and monastery libraries in the sixteenth century, but the first modern public library dates from 1758 when the Biblioteca Turriana—named after its founder and donors, the three cathedral canons Luis Antonio Torres Quintero, Cayetano Antonio de Torres Tuñón, and Luis Antonio de Torres Tuñón—was established at the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral. Liberal governments seized its holdings in 1867 to establish the National Library.

Japanese public libraries greatly expanded in the 1950s with the Library Law.

==Services==
===Book borrowing and lending===

The main task of public libraries is to provide the public with access to books and periodicals. The American Library Association (ALA), addresses this role of libraries as part of &quot;access to information&quot; and &quot;equity of access&quot;; part of the profession&#x27;s ethical commitment that &quot;no one should be denied information because he or she cannot afford the cost of a book or periodical, have access to the internet or information in any of its various formats.&quot;

Libraries typically offer access to thousands, tens of thousands, or even millions of books, the majority of which are available for borrowing by anyone with the appropriate library card. A library&#x27;s selection of books is called its &quot;collection&quot;, and usually includes a range of popular fiction, classics, nonfiction and reference works, books of public interest or under public discussion, and subscriptions to popular newspapers and magazines. Most libraries offer quiet space for reading, known as reading rooms. Borrowers may also take books home, as long as they return them at a certain time and in good condition. If a borrowed book is returned late, the library may charge a small library fine, though some libraries have eliminated fines in recent years. About two-thirds of libraries now provide access to e-books and digital or digitized periodicals as well as printed books. Many libraries offer assistance to borrowers, to select books, through specialist Readers&#x27; Advisory Services librarians.

Public libraries also provide books and other materials for children. These items are often housed in a special section known as a children&#x27;s library and attended to by a specialized children&#x27;s librarian. Child oriented websites with on-line educational games and programs specifically designed for younger library users are becoming increasingly popular. Services may be provided for other groups, such as large print or braille materials, books on tape, young adult literature and other materials for teenagers, or materials in other than the national language (in foreign languages).

Libraries also lend books to each other, a practice known as interlibrary loan. Interlibrary loan allows libraries to provide patrons access to the collections of other libraries, especially rare, infrequently used, specialized and/or out-of-print books. Libraries within the same system, such as a county system, may lend their books to each other, or libraries in different states may even use an interlibrary loan system.

The selection, purchase and cataloging of books for a collection; the care, repair, and weeding of books; the organization of books in the library; readers&#x27; advisory; and the management of membership, borrowing and lending are typical tasks for a public librarian, an information professional with graduate-level education or experience in library and information science.

====Privacy====

In the United States, libraries are responsible for supporting the First Amendment and how it relates to their facilities through policies such as the American Library Association&#x27;s Library Bill of Rights. The right to freedom of speech and information is significant to public libraries; one way of upholding this doctrine is to protect the privacy of all patrons that belong to a library. The concept of confidentiality is important because the First Amendment may be violated if a patron&#x27;s information could possibly be shared. Patrons may not feel free to check out certain materials for fear it would later be revealed. Members of society need to be reassured that even if they borrow controversial or embarrassing materials, their privacy will be upheld.

Some libraries require staff to talk about confidentiality or direct the patron to literature on the subject when creating a new library card for patrons.

===Digital engagement===
Part of the public library mission has become attempting to help bridge the digital divide. As more books, information resources, and government services are being provided online (see e-commerce and e-government), public libraries increasingly provide access to the Internet and public computers for users who otherwise would not be able to connect to these services. They can also provide community spaces to encourage the general population to improve their digital skills through Library Coding Clubs and Library makerspace. Almost all public libraries now house a computer lab. Internationally, public libraries offer information and communication technology (ICT) services, giving &quot;access to information and knowledge&quot; the &quot;highest priority&quot;. While different countries and areas of the world have their own requirements, general services offered include free connection to the Internet, training in using the Internet, and relevant content in appropriate languages. In addition to typical public library financing, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and business fund services that assist public libraries in combating the digital divide.
In addition to access, many public libraries offer training and support to computer users. Once access has been achieved, there remains a large gap in people&#x27;s online abilities and skills. For many communities, the public library is the only agency offering free computer classes, information technology learning and an affordable, interactive way to build digital skills. , 91% of libraries offer free wireless Internet to their patrons; 76% offer e-books for borrowing; and 90% offer formal or informal technology training. A significant service provided by public libraries is assisting people with e-government access and use of federal, state and local government information, forms and services.
In 2006, 73% percent of library branches reported that they are the only local provider of free public computer and Internet access. A 2008 study found that &quot;100 percent of rural, high poverty outlets provide public Internet access.&quot; Access to computers and the Internet is now nearly as important to library patrons as access to books.

===Classroom and meeting space===

Public libraries have a long history of functioning as community centers or public spaces for reading, study and formal and informal public meetings. In 1898, Andrew Carnegie, a prominent library philanthropist, built a library in Homestead, Pennsylvania, where his main steel mills were located. Besides a book collection, it included a bowling alley, an indoor swimming pool, basketball courts and other athletic facilities, a music hall, and numerous meeting rooms for local organizations. It sponsored highly successful semi-pro football and baseball teams. Even before the development of the modern public library, subscription libraries were often used as clubs or gathering places. They served as much for social gossip and the meeting of friends, as coffee shops do today. Throughout history, public libraries were touted as alternatives to dance halls or gentleman&#x27;s clubs, and frequently built, organized and supported because of their equalizing and civilizing influence.

Today, in-person and on-line programs for reader development, language learning, homework help, free lectures and cultural performances, and other community service programs are common offerings. The library storytime, in which books are read aloud to children and infants, is a cultural touchstone. Most public libraries offer frequent storytimes, often daily or even several times a day for different age groups. Some libraries have begun offering sensory storytimes for children and adults on the autism spectrum. Sensory storytimes give patrons &quot;more ways to process information&quot;, especially considering people on the autism spectrum are concrete thinkers and/or might have sensory issues to fluorescent lightning or ambient noise other patrons might not notice.

One of the most popular programs offered in public libraries is &quot;summer reading&quot; for children, families, and adults. Summer reading usually includes a list of books to read during summer holidays, as well as performances, book discussions or other celebrations of reading, culture and the humanities. Many libraries offer classes to the community such as tech clinics where patrons can bring in laptops and electronic devices and receive one on one attention in solving their problems and learning how to use them.
Libraries may also offer free or inexpensive meeting space for community organizations and educational and entrepreneurial activity. The addition of makerspaces in libraries (this is usually referred to as community outreach), beginning with the Fayetteville Free Library in 2011, offers the potential for new roles for public spaces and public libraries. Attendance at library programs increased by 22% between 2004 and 2008.

===Programming===
While in the past libraries were merely buildings to house their collections, most now utilize their space to offer programs or clubs regularly. Although some libraries will have similar programs with different names, such as book club, writing club or computer programs, most programs will differ based on the specific library and the community they serve. New studies have shown that librarians must research what their specific community needs, &quot;because communities differ, however, the ways libraries implement these services differ as well. The [example of service response] offered at one library may vary significantly from [the same example] offered by another library. The differences are perfectly appropriate if they result from a tailoring of services to address local needs.&quot; Websites like Pinterest have numerous ideas for creating programs for local patrons, while the website Instructables has DIY tutorials, complete with pictures, which is helpful for libraries on a budget. &quot;Programs in the humanities and the arts that encourage people to think and talk about ethics and values, history, art, poetry, and other cultures are integral to the library&#x27;s mission.&quot;

====Adult programs====
Adult library programming in the United States initially had strong ties to adult education and adult literacy. Margaret E. Monroe traced these connections on the 25th anniversary of the U.S. Adult Education Act which was part of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964.

The American Library Association supported the &quot;Adult Services in the Eighties&quot; (ASE) project which replicated an earlier ALA 1952-53 survey, &quot;Adult Education Activities in Public Libraries&quot; by Helen Lyman Smith. The ASE project was conducted to provide planning for new directions for adult library services. Sources on the scope of adult services include &quot;Where Would We Be without Them? Libraries and Adult Education Activities: 1966–91&quot;, &quot;Twenty-First Century Public Library Adult Services&quot;,&quot;Adult Programs in the Library,&quot; and &quot;Designing Adult Services Strategies For Better Serving Your Community.&quot; A national study of public library service to older adults was conducted in 2015.

The New York Public Library offers over 93,000 programs to its patrons every year at its 87 different branches. Adult programs include Excel classes, writing club, adult coloring club, chess club, knitting club, and a jewelry making class.

The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Library has an adult coloring club, a crochet/knitting/sewing club, a gardening club, a bead and string class, and a bilingual computer class.

The Tampa–Hillsborough County Public Library System has 31 branches that offer the usual book clubs and writing clubs for adults. However, they also offer an early morning walking club, chair yoga classes, beginning computer classes, genealogy classes, walk-in tech help, and a coffee and French talk class.

====Teen programs====
The Orange County Library System offers numerous teen activities such as a Maker/DIY program, Audio Equipment Training, Sewing classes, Knitting classes, ESL classes, and Chess club.

The Springfield Greene County Library has writing and book clubs as well as a tech training class, board game nights, movie nights, craft classes, and a &quot;My Little Pony&quot; club.

The Pikes Peak Library District has math tutors for their teen patrons. They also offer writing and book clubs, a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; club, a coding lab, an anime club, guided meditation, and an occasional &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; Tournament.

====Children&#x27;s programs====
The Belmont Public Library offers an array of children&#x27;s programs including story times for various age groups, concerts, music classes, puppet shows, a maker club, and sing-along Saturdays.

The Saratoga Springs Public Library also has numerous story times as well as Yoga for children, parent/child workshops, Spanish workshops, a read-to-a-dog program, and a Kindness club.

The Chelmsford Public Library has a plethora of story times for ages birth to preschool. They also offer baby yoga, stay and play time, toddler rhyme time, a dads and donuts day, and an annual Gingerbread Festival.

===Diversity===

A significant goal of American libraries is to become more culturally diverse throughout the country. Public libraries are an equal access facility and want to make everyone feel welcome no matter their religion, race, ethnicity, sex, or financial status. To accomplish this goal, libraries are striving to find ways in which to make both staff and the library programs they provide more culturally sensitive.
A starting point for most libraries is to find out the demographics in which they are located. Once the library system learns more about the community they serve, they can start building a collection and programs around it. Another suggestion from multiple experts says to hire staff that represents the society that the library is located in order to better relate and serve members of that society.

By making culturally diverse programs, a library can be inviting to many members of the community. A few ways libraries accomplish this goal are by providing programs which are inclusive to many different cultures such as having lectures or events in different languages, including celebrations and holidays that are diverse, and by inviting speakers and authors from different cultures to come and talk. 
===Research assistance===

Librarians at most public libraries provide reference and research help to the general public. This can include assisting students in finding reliable sources for papers and presentations; helping the public find answers to questions or evidence in a debate; or providing resources related to a specific event or topic. Reference assistance is usually provided through a reference interview which is usually conducted at a public reference desk but may also be conducted by telephone or online. Reference librarians may also help patrons develop an appropriate bibliography or works cited page for an academic paper. Depending on the size of the library, there may be multiple reference desks that deal with different topics. Large public, academic or research libraries may employ librarians that are experts in specific topics or subjects. Often the children&#x27;s section in a public library has its own reference desk. At a smaller library, circulation and reference may occur at the same desk.
The Internet has had a significant effect on the availability and delivery of reference services. Many reference works, such as the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, have moved entirely online, and the way people access and use these works has changed dramatically in recent decades. The rise of search engines and crowd-sourced resources such as Wikipedia have transformed the reference environment. In addition to the traditional reference interview, reference librarians have an increasing role in providing access to digitized reference works (including the selection and purchase of databases not available to the general public) and ensuring that references are reliable and presented in an academically acceptable manner. Librarians also have a role in teaching information literacy, so that patrons can find, understand and use information and finding aids like search engines, databases and library catalogs: for instance, patrons who lack access to expensive academic subscriptions can be taught to Unpaywall to access open access literature easily.

Public and academic libraries in the US answer over seven million questions weekly. The Boston Public Library answers more than one million reference questions annually.

===Reference collections===

In addition to their circulating collection, public libraries usually offer a collection of reference books, such encyclopedias, dictionaries, phone books and unique or expensive academic works. These books may not be available for borrowing, except under special circumstances. Reference books that are frequently used, such as phone books, may be housed in a special section called &quot;ready reference&quot;.

Some libraries also keep historical documents relevant to their particular town, and serve as a resource for historians in some instances. The Queens Public Library kept letters written by unrecognized Tiffany lamp designer Clara Driscoll, and the letters remained in the library until a curator discovered them. Some libraries may also serve as archives or government depositories, preserving historic newspapers, property records or government documents. Collections of unique or historical works are sometimes referred to as special collections; except in rare cases, these items are reference items, and patrons must use them inside the library under the supervision or guidance of a librarian. Local libraries&#x27; special collections may be of particular interest to people researching their family history. Libraries that are focused on collecting works related to particular families are genealogical libraries and may be housed in the same building as a public library.
Many libraries—especially large, urban libraries—have large collections of photographs, digital images, rare and fragile books, artifacts and manuscripts available for public viewing and use. Digitization and digital preservation of these works is an ongoing effort, usually funded by grants or philanthropy. In 2005, the New York Public Library offered the &quot;NYPL Digital Gallery&quot; which made a collection of 275,000 images viewable over the web; while most of the contents are in the public domain, some images are still subject to copyright rules. Limited funding, copyright restrictions, a lack of expertise and poor provenance are barriers to the large-scale digitization of libraries&#x27; special collections.

===Other services===
Depending on a community&#x27;s desires and needs, public libraries may offer many other resources and services to the public. In addition to print books and periodicals, most public libraries today have a wide array of other media including audiobooks, e-books, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, and DVDs. Certain libraries stock general materials for borrowing, such as pots, pans, sewing machines, and similar household items in order to appeal to a larger population. Collections of books and academic research related to the local town or region are common, along with collections of works by local authors. Libraries&#x27; storage space and lending systems may be used to lend a wide range of materials, including works of art, cake pans, seeds, tools and musical instruments. Similar to museums and other cultural institutions, libraries may also host exhibits or exhibitions.

In addition to the extension of media variety and services, public libraries have been experimenting with different means to cater more specifically to their local patrons. One such program in California, Zip Books, works to provide books that libraries may not have in their collections for patrons who may be looking for them. Initially started as a pilot program in 2011 through an LSTA grant from the California Public Library system, the program works by patrons of partnered library districts initially making requests for books through Zip that their libraries does not possess. The libraries then purchase the books and have them sent directly to the patron requesting them. Then, once the patron has finished the books, they simply bring them to their local library, where the library will then incorporate them into their collection. Any libraries seeking to join the program can write out an application for their district to join Zip and their application then goes through a review process determined by need and the funding that is available. Funding is then distributed to members each year, with current members and libraries already on a waitlist taking first priority. This program, as of early 2022, has been expanded to 89 districts throughout California and any new applicants can apply for up to $35,000 worth of books in tangible formats. The maintenance of this program does fall onto the individual libraries and their librarians are then responsible for record keeping and managing the grant funds and their requests.

As more government services move online, libraries and librarians have a role in providing access to online forms and assistance with filling them out. For example, in 2013, American public libraries were promoted as a way for people to access online health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.
In rural areas, the local public library may have a bookmobile service, consisting of one or more buses or pack animals (such as burros, camels, donkey, or elephants) furnished as small public libraries, some equipped with Internet access points or computer labs, and serving the countryside according to a regular schedule. In communities that are extremely isolated or that have poor digital infrastructure, libraries may provide the only access to online education, telemedicine, or remote work. Libraries also partner with schools and community organizations to promote literacy and learning.

24-hour library access has been piloted in certain public libraries in North America, such as the Pioneer Library System&#x27;s Norman Public Library in Oklahoma and Ottawa Public Library in Ontario. Such access may involve anywhere from a &quot;library vending machine&quot;, in which print books are mechanically vended to (and dispensed from) patrons, to reduced staff during the night and early morning hours.

Libraries promote cultural awareness; in Newark, New Jersey, the public library celebrated African-American history with exhibits and programs. One account suggested libraries were essential to &quot;economic competitiveness&quot; as well as &quot;neighborhood vitality&quot; and help some people find jobs.
Libraries have in important role during emergencies and disasters, where they may be used as shelters, provide space to charge phones and access the Internet, and serve as locations for the distribution of aid, especially financial aid, which requires access to computers and the Internet. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency recognizes libraries as providing essential community service during times of disaster. Libraries have also had in increasingly important economic role during the recession, providing job search assistance, computer skills training and resume help to patrons.

In response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, many libraries have begun offering remote and distance learning options for patrons.
==Organization==
The establishment or development of a public library involves creating a legal authorization and governing structure, building a collection of books and media, as well as securing reliable funding sources, especially government sources. Most public libraries are small, serving a population of under 25,000, and are (or were) established in response to specific local needs. In &quot;A Library Primer&quot;, John Cotton Dana&#x27;s 1899 work on the establishment and management of libraries in the United States, Dana wrote:
Each community has different needs, and begins its library under different conditions. Consider then, whether you need most a library devoted chiefly to the work of helping the schools, or one to be used mainly for reference, or one that shall run largely to periodicals and be not much more than a reading room, or one particularly attractive to girls and women, or one that shall not be much more than a cheerful resting-place, attractive enough to draw man and boy from street corner and saloon. Decide this question early, that all effort may be concentrated to one end, and that your young institution may suit the community in which it is to grow, and from which it is to gain its strength.
After being established and funded through a resolution, public referendum or similar legal process, the library is usually managed by a board of directors, library council or other local authority. A librarian is designated as the library director or library manager. In small municipalities, city or county government may serve as the library board and there may be only one librarian involved in the management and direction of the library. Library staff who are not involved in management are known in the United States and some other English-speaking countries as &quot;library paraprofessionals&quot; or &quot;library support staff&quot;. They may or may not have formal education in library and information science. Support staff have important roles in library collection development, cataloging, technical support, and the process of preparing books for borrowing. All of these tasks may be referred to as &quot;technical services&quot;, whether or not they involve information technology. While the library&#x27;s governing board has ultimate authority to establish policy, many other organizations may participate in library management or library fundraising, including civic and voluntary associations, women&#x27;s clubs, Friends of the Library groups, and groups established to advise the library on the purchase and retention of books.

State and national governments may also have a role in the establishment and organization of public libraries. Many governments operate their own large libraries for public and legislative use (e.g., state libraries, the Library of Congress, the ). These governments can also influence local libraries by reserving formal recognition or funding for libraries that meet specific requirements. Finally, associations of library and information professionals, such as the American Library Association (ALA) and the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) help establish norms and standard procedures, secure funding, advocate at the state or national level and certify library schools or information schools.

==Funding==
 Public libraries are funded from a range of sources, the most significant of which is usually local or municipal funding. The citizens who use a local library support it via the city or county government, or through a special-purpose district, which is a local government body that has independent leadership and may levy its own taxes. Local funding may be supplemented by other government funding. For example, in the United States, the state and federal governments provide supplementary funding for public libraries through state aid programs, the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) and E-Rate. In England, Local Authorities have a statutory duty to provide residents with a library service as set out in the Local Government Act 1974. State and local governments may also offer cities and counties large grants for library construction or renovation. Private philanthropy has also had a significant role in the expansion and transformation of library services, and, like other educational institutions, some libraries may be partially funded by an endowment. Some proactive librarians have devised alliances with patron and civic groups to supplement their financial situations. Library &quot;friends&quot; groups, activist boards, and well organized book sales also supplement government funding.

Public funding has always been an important part of the definition of a public library. However, with local governments facing financial pressures due to the Great Recession, some libraries have explored ways to supplement public funding. Cafes, bakeries, bookstores, gift shops and similar commercial endeavors are common features of new and urban libraries. The Boston Public Library has two restaurants and an online store which features reproductions of photographs and artwork. Pressure on funding has also led to closer partnerships between libraries, and between libraries and for-profit ventures, in order to sustain the library as a public space while providing business opportunities to the community. While still fairly uncommon, public-private partnerships and &quot;mixed-use&quot; or &quot;dual-use&quot; libraries, which provide services to the public and one or more student populations, are occasionally explored as alternatives. Jackson County, Oregon (US), closed its entire 15-branch public library system for six months in 2007, reopening with under a public-private partnership and a reduced schedule. Small fees, such as library fines or printing fees, may also offset the cost of providing library services, though fines and fees do not usually have a significant role in library funding. The decline of support from local governments has left libraries compensating at the expense of their patrons. In the article &quot;Waking Up to Advocacy in a New Political Reality for Libraries&quot;, as early as the 1980s, libraries began charging fees and accruing fines for services rendered. These services included &quot;printing, notarizing, scanning, photocopying, photo services, library cards for those who live outside of the service area, meeting room usage, document searches, inter-library loan, and e-book checkouts, and among many others&quot;.

Data shows disparities in private and public libraries, exemplifying that libraries in rural areas possess weaker technological infrastructures and fewer full-time employees holding the title of Librarian. Data shows that funding and service levels differ across and within states. Rural libraries tend to have smaller collections, lower bandwidth rates, less staff and fewer hours of operations. Access to high quality internet may be limited for lower-income individuals, ethnic minorities and rural residents. Due to underused libraries in less-advantaged communities, local governments have permanently closed libraries, affecting individuals that are less educated.

Although usage of public libraries has increased significantly in recent decades, libraries are under intense financial pressure and scrutiny. The American Library Association says media reports it compiled in 2004 showed some $162 million in funding cuts to libraries nationwide. In 2009, 40% of states reported a decline in state aid for libraries. In 2012, Great Britain lost over 200 libraries to budget cuts, part of a general trend of fiscal austerity in Europe. However, there are signs of stabilization in library funding. , funding for construction and renovation of new libraries remains steady. Cities&#x27; plans to close public libraries are frequently cancelled or scaled back. In 2012, voters in 13 U.S. states approved new funding for library construction or operations. In the UK, the Library of Birmingham, which opened in 2013, is the largest cultural space in Europe.

Survey data suggests the public values free public libraries. A Public Agenda survey in 2006 reported 84% of the public said maintaining free library services should be a top priority for their local library. Public libraries received higher ratings for effectiveness than other local services such as parks and police. But the survey also found the public was mostly unaware of financial difficulties facing their libraries. In various cost-benefit studies libraries continue to provide returns on the taxpayer dollar far higher than other municipal spending. A 2008 survey discusses comprehensively the prospects for increased funding in the United States, saying in conclusion &quot;There is sufficient, but latent, support for increased library funding among the voting population.&quot; A 2013 Pew Research Center survey reported that 90% of Americans ages 16 and older said that the closing of their local public library would affect their community, with 63% saying it would have a &quot;major&quot; impact.

<text>Thomas Robert Bugeaud, marquis de la Piconnerie, duc d&#x27;Isly (15 October 178410 June 1849) was a Marshal of France and Governor-General of Algeria during the French colonization. Born an aristocrat, he has a complex legacy, serving as a soldier during the Napoleonic wars, focusing on agriculture during Bourbon rule, then serving the July monarchy in Algeria during which he achieved undoubted military success, while also being complicit in actions which today may be understood as war crimes and caused outrage at the time.

==Early life==
He was born at Limoges, a member of a noble family of Périgord (Occitania), the youngest of thirteen children. He ran away from home, and for some years lived in the country as an agricultural worker. At the age of twenty, he became a private soldier in the &quot;Vélites&quot; of the Imperial Guard, with which he took part in the Austerlitz campaign of the following year. Early in 1806, he was given a commission, and as a Second Lieutenant he served in the Jena and Eylau campaigns, winning his promotion to the rank of lieutenant at the Battle of Pultusk.

In 1808, he was in the first French corps to enter Spain, and was stationed in Madrid during the revolt of the Dos Mayo. At the Second Siege of Zaragossa, he won further promotion to the rank of captain, and in 1809–1810 found opportunities for winning distinction under Suchet in the eastern theatre of the Peninsular War, in which he rose to the rank of major and the command of a full regiment. At the first restoration he was made a colonel, but he rejoined Napoleon during the Hundred Days, and under his old chief Suchet distinguished himself in the war in the Alps.
==July monarchy==
He spent the fifteen years after the fall of Napoleon without employment, returning to agriculture and developing his home district of Périgord. 

The July Revolution of 1830 reopened his military career, and after a short tenure of regimental command he was in 1831 promoted brigadier-general (&quot;maréchal de camp&quot;). In the same year, he was elected to the French parliament&#x27;s lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, where he showed himself to be an inflexible opponent of democracy. In his military capacity, he was noted for his severity in suppressing riots. His conduct as gaoler of the Duchess of Berry led to a duel between Bugeaud and the deputy DulongFr] in which the latter was killed (1834); this affair, and the heavy-handed suppression of a further riot, exposed Bugeaud to ceaseless attacks in the Chamber and in the press, though his opinion was sought by all parties in matters connected with agriculture and industrial development. He was re-elected in 1834, 1837, and 1839.

===Algeria===
Although he initially disapproved of the conquest of Algeria, his undeviating adherence to Louis Philippe brought him into agreement with the government. He embarked on a campaign to win the swift, complete, and lasting subjugation of Algeria. He was sent to Africa with orders from Paris to bring the war in western Algeria to a satisfactory conclusion, wherein he proceeded to initiate his war of flying columns. He won his first victory on 6 July 1836 against an army of 10,000 regular and tribal warriors of Abd al-Qadir, and returned home with the rank of lieutenant-general. In the following year, he signed the Treaty of Tafna (30 May 1837), with Abd al-Qadir, which led to attacks upon him in the chamber, to the refutation of which Bugeaud devoted himself in 1839. Historian James McDougall argues in his &quot;History of Algeria&quot; that the treaty accomplished little for the French noting that Bugeaud by his own invention styled the amir a &#x27;great vassal of France&#x27; and while tribute was initially requested Bugeaud dropped this only securing concessions that Algerian trade would occur only in French held ports, however this provision was flouted by French and Algerian traders alike. 

There is also controversy about the language Bugeaud inserted into the differing versions of the treaty, in French article one read that Abd al-Qadir ‘recognised the sovereignty of France in Africa’. The Arabic text instead read that &quot;the amir ‘is aware of the rule of French power&quot; (ya‘rifu hukm saltanat firansa) in Africa’. McDougall argues on the basis of Abd al-Qadir&#x27;s letters to Bugeaud negotiating the treaty that it cannot have been a translation error and the differing meaning of the texts constitutes duplicity on Bugeaud&#x27;s part.

In addition to the public contents of the treaty Bugeaud and Abdelkader came to a number of private agreements in addition to the final treaties text. Bugeaud promised the emir modern weapons, to through French force of arms relocate the Dawa’ir and Zmala tribes away from Abd al-Qadirs domain and to exile from Algeria of their chiefs for which Bugeaud received a cash payment which he utilised to support his political career in France spending it to fund roadworks in his constituency.

The treaty allowed the French space to prioritise other threats to their control over Algeria, and avenge General Clauzel&#x27;s failure to subdue the Beylik of Constantine. Following the death of General Damrémont, at the subsequent years successful siege of Constantine, and the retirement due to ill health of Marshal Valée in 1840, Bugeaud was nominated governor-general of Algeria. 

Early in 1841 he put his system of flying columns, a controversial but successful tactic known as &quot;Razzia&quot; into effecr. His swiftness and energy drove back the forces of Abd al-Qadir from place to place, while the devotion of the to &quot;Père Bugeaud&quot; enabled him to carry all before him in action. In 1842, he secured the French positions by undertaking the construction of roads. In 1843, Bugeaud was made marshal of France, and in this and the following year he continued his operations with unvarying success. His great victory of Isly on 14 August 1844 defeated a Moroccan army that attempted to intervene in Algeria so decisively that effectively a civil war broke out between the Moroccans and Abd al-Qadir and won him the title of duke.

In 1845, however, he had to take the field again in consequence of the disaster of Sidi Brahim (22 September 1845), and up to his final retirement from Algeria (July 1846) he was almost constantly employed in the field, by ordering in February 1846 to General Jean-François Gentil to organize the second campaign against the rebels of Kabylia. His resignation was due to differences with the home government on the question of the future government of the province. Amidst his other activities he had found time to study the agricultural characteristics of the conquered country, and under his régime the number of French colonists had grown from 17,000 to 100,000.

== Counter insurgency strategy in Algeria and his legacy in military strategy ==

=== The Algerian conquest in context ===
Before Bugeaud there had been nine changes of governor in eleven years, politics in the metropole too was in flux with a coup in Paris only weeks after the initial landing in Algiers. France now a constitutional monarchy saw the composition of its legislature and its government change with political fortunes in a way that had not happened since the 1820 franchising reforms. Defeats in Algeria were deemed inexcusable and Generals were fired to quell outrage at home. Together these factors caused colonial policy to change rapidly, and in those eleven years French holdings expanded slowly from their initial coastal enclaves.

Initial French strategy was to fortify, garrison and thus ensure the obedience and loyalty of the native population. However this risked leaving each garrison - especially those in the hinterlands in a position of being so small they could not simultaneously defend their position and conduct some manoeuvre operation outside of it for doing so risked weakening themselves to the point of risking being defeated in detail by Algerian fighters.

Indeed such events transpired at the Battle of Macta in 1835 where a French force of 2,500 men was destroyed at the hands of Abd al-Qadir, the ensuring outrage provoking the replacement of the then governor by Bugeaud.

Bugeaud&#x27;s term as governor stands out both for its length in the conquest period, nearly seven years but also for his success. Where before French strategy revolved around garrisoning every new outpost, Bugeaud attempted to reconcile Algerians to French rule with great cruelty and violence but also self interest leading to some historians citing him as an early practitioner of counter insurgency operations and was especially influential in French military thinking in regard to colonial campaigns. Especially influenced where Generals Joseph Gallieni and Hubert Lyautey who were active in French colonial campaigns globally who innovated upon many ideas first set out by Bugeaud and subordinates in Algeria to create the &#x27;oil-spot&#x27; method of establishing colonial control and gaining local acquiescence. Comparatively, the &#x27;oil-spot&#x27; method involved a much lesser focus on violence, destruction of property and coercion than Bugeaud&#x27;s campaign in Algeria.

=== Trade, propaganda and a Fatwa ===
Bugeaud was aware of the potential of economic opportunities that came with French rule as a factor in increasing support for his occupation;

Not only did this strengthen French ties with native Algerians but it also provided propaganda at home that painted the French conquest of Algeria as a moral and civilizing mission ensuring support for his mission from liberal and leftist deputies.

Silvain d’Amboise a French convert to Islam during travels to Mecca, Cairo and Baghdad succeeded in having a fatwa drafted authorising Algerian Muslims to live under French rule, this contradicted an existing fatwa from a Moroccan Imam sought by Abd el-Qadirs which forbade Muslims from living under the rule of the French.

=== Razzias and military policy ===
One economic opportunity for native Algerians under French rule was service in native regiments, this not only granted certain tribes tax exemptions in exchange for service - under a similar arrangement that had been practiced under the Ottoman Regency. But it also netted friendly tribes a share of the loot obtained from raids undertaken. 

Bugeaud was influenced by French experience in the Vendee, Spain and also native warfare in innovating French military doctrine to meet the challenges posed by the little war in Algieria.

But the change in French fortunes against Algerian resistance is not solely a product of Bugeaud&#x27;s doctrinal and organisational reforms, his predecessors operated with less resources and manpower when Bugeaud assumed the governor-generalship total French forces in Algeria comprised some 60,000 men, by 1847 this was 109,000. 

Bugeaud was especially keen to recruit native cavalry as to match the capabilities of his opponents and to provide mobility to his flying columns. One of Bugeaud&#x27;s major changes in policy compared to his predecessors was a reduce the number of garrisons substantially, in arguing for this change in policy he argued to the war minister on the basis of the Russian failures to suppress resistance in the Caucasus.

With reduced garrisoning requirements as well as greater forces available to him Bugeaud was able to increase the number of and size of his &#x27;flying columns&#x27;, one of Bugeauds typical columns consisted of 4,000 infantrymen, 2,000 French Cavalrymen, 1,000 native Spahis and 3 batteries of artillery. In the artillery too there was a marked difference from his predecessors who had favoured larger calibres, Bugeaud emphasised lighter guns especially mountain batteries for their ability to keep pace with other elements of the column.

The &#x27;flying columns&#x27; undertook Razzias as a putative measures against tribes who had been hostile to France. Killing was often indiscriminate, and those not killed were kept in French camps providing additional leverage for their tribe to make peace. Crops were burnt and livestock taken, this had a significant effect on the native Algerian population, whose numbers collapsed from estimates of 3 million in 1830 before the French conquest to 2.5 million by 1851.

French officers under Bugeaud&#x27;s command justified raids on the basis that the Algerian hinterland by virtue of being an agrarian economy had no industrial or political centre by which an army could siege or capture and thus win a campaign and thus to wage war they must target the productive heart of the Algerian rural economy - agriculture.

In terms of personnel, in contrast to the situation he inherited was a revolving door of officers, he emphasised the need for army officers who had experience in Algeria to remain there, suggesting in his published work financial incentives to make that possible.

=== Atrocities ===
Under Bugeaud&#x27;s command the French army conducted the widespread use of razzias or raids, while they did not officially aim to kill non combatants this was not universally adhered to. One razzia conducted by General Gentil on the Beni Zeroual tribe in 1843 resulted in 150 killed, 712 prisoners, in exchange for 39 French casualties.

The cumulative effect of raids that targeted the agrarian economy of rural Algeria caused widespread famine and it was as much this combined with the leverage gained from taking prisoners that forced tribes to make peace.

A less common occurrence was a policy of &#x27;&quot;enfumades&quot;&#x27; where fires would be lit at the entrance to caves into which Algerians had retreated. The massacre of the Ouled Riah tribe in late 1842 killed some 800 members of the tribe indiscriminately. War Minister Marshal Soult attempted to cover up the case but despite that it was leaked to the press and widely condemned in France.

But under Bugeaud the practice continued infrequently with military officers claiming caves represented the final citadel of tribes. These aspects of his campaign clash sharply with his own writings that painted the French conquest of Algeria as a civilising mission.

Marina Miron&#x27;s analysis of Bugeaud as a counter insurgency commander was one on the extreme violent side of the scale, in comparison to other approaches taken by other commanders in similar situations at different points in history. Miron notes Bugeaud was able to adapt to local conditions and methods of war, use coercive force (though extremely) and institute controls upon population movement as well as building local infrastructure - all of the hallmarks although in different proportions of modern counter-insurgency doctrines.

==Later life==

In 1848, Bugeaud was in Paris during the revolution of 1848, but his orders prevented him from acting effectively to suppress it. He was asked, but eventually refused, to be a candidate for the presidency in opposition to Louis Napoleon. His last public service was the command of the army of the Alps, formed in 1848–1849 to observe events in Italy. He died in Paris in 1849.

Bugeaud&#x27;s writings were numerous, including his &quot;Œuvres militaires&quot;, collected by Weil (Paris, 1883), many official reports on Algeria and the war there, and some works on economics and political science. See: Comte d&#x27;Ideville, &quot;Le Maréchal Bugeaud&quot; (Paris, 1881–1882).

==Homage and criticism==
Streets and places have been given his name in the cities of Paris, Brest, Albertville, Auxerre, Lyon, Marseille, Périgueux, attempts to change these street names have always failed up to now.

In 2021, because of war crimes committed by Bugeaud during the French conquest of Algeria, the municipality of Marseille decides to change his name of a school, and give it those of Ahmed Litim Fr], an Algerian tirailleur killed during the liberation of the city in 1944.

<text>The Mayan languages form a language family spoken in Mesoamerica, both in the south of Mexico and northern Central America. Mayan languages are spoken by at least six million Maya people, primarily in Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras. In 1996, Guatemala formally recognized 21 Mayan languages by name, and Mexico recognizes eight within its territory. 

The Mayan language family is one of the best-documented and most studied in the Americas. Modern Mayan languages descend from the Proto-Mayan language, thought to have been spoken at least 5,000 years ago; it has been partially reconstructed using the comparative method. The proto-Mayan language diversified into at least six different branches: the Huastecan, Quichean, Yucatecan, Qanjobalan, Mamean and Chʼolan–Tzeltalan branches.

Mayan languages form part of the Mesoamerican language area, an area of linguistic convergence developed throughout millennia of interaction between the peoples of Mesoamerica. All Mayan languages display the basic diagnostic traits of this linguistic area. For example, all use relational nouns instead of prepositions to indicate spatial relationships. They also possess grammatical and typological features that set them apart from other languages of Mesoamerica, such as the use of ergativity in the grammatical treatment of verbs and their subjects and objects, specific inflectional categories on verbs, and a special word class of &quot;positionals&quot; which is typical of all Mayan languages.

During the pre-Columbian era of Mesoamerican history, some Mayan languages were written in the logo-syllabic Maya script. Its use was particularly widespread during the Classic period of Maya civilization (c. 250–900). The surviving corpus of over 5,000 known individual Maya inscriptions on buildings, monuments, pottery and bark-paper codices, combined with the rich post-Conquest literature in Mayan languages written in the Latin script, provides a basis for the modern understanding of pre-Columbian history unparalleled in the Americas.

==History==

===Proto-Mayan===

Mayan languages are the descendants of a proto-language called Proto-Mayan or, in Kʼicheʼ Maya, &quot;Nabʼee Mayaʼ Tzij&quot; (&quot;the old Maya Language&quot;). The Proto-Mayan language is believed to have been spoken in the Cuchumatanes highlands of central Guatemala in an area corresponding roughly to where Qʼanjobalan is spoken today. The earliest proposal which identified the Chiapas-Guatemalan highlands as the likely &quot;cradle&quot; of Mayan languages was published by the German antiquarian and scholar Karl Sapper in 1912. Terrence Kaufman and John Justeson have reconstructed more than 3000 lexical items for the proto-Mayan language.

According to the prevailing classification scheme by Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the first division occurred around 2200 BCE, when Huastecan split away from Mayan proper after its speakers moved northwest along the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Proto-Yucatecan and Proto-Chʼolan speakers subsequently split off from the main group and moved north into the Yucatán Peninsula. Speakers of the western branch moved south into the areas now inhabited by Mamean and Quichean people. When speakers of proto-Tzeltalan later separated from the Chʼolan group and moved south into the Chiapas Highlands, they came into contact with speakers of Mixe–Zoque languages. According to an alternative theory by Robertson and Houston, Huastecan stayed in the Guatemalan highlands with speakers of Chʼolan–Tzeltalan, separating from that branch at a much later date than proposed by Kaufman.

In the Archaic period (before 2000 BCE), a number of loanwords from Mixe–Zoquean languages seem to have entered the proto-Mayan language. This has led to hypotheses that the early Maya were dominated by speakers of Mixe–Zoquean languages, possibly the Olmec. In the case of the Xincan and Lencan languages, on the other hand, Mayan languages are more often the source than the receiver of loanwords. Mayan language specialists such as Campbell believe this suggests a period of intense contact between Maya and the Lencan and Xinca people, possibly during the Classic period (250–900).

===Classic period===

During the Classic period the major branches began diversifying into separate languages. The split between Proto-Yucatecan (in the north, that is, the Yucatán Peninsula) and Proto-Chʼolan (in the south, that is, the Chiapas highlands and Petén Basin) had already occurred by the Classic period, when most extant Maya inscriptions were written. Both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the Maya sites of the time, and both are commonly referred to as &quot;Classic Maya language&quot;. Although a single prestige language was by far the most frequently recorded on extant hieroglyphic texts, evidence for at least three different varieties of Mayan have been discovered within the hieroglyphic corpus—an Eastern Chʼolan variety found in texts written in the southern Maya area and the highlands, a Western Chʼolan variety diffused from the Usumacinta region from the mid-7th century on, and a Yucatecan variety found in the texts from the Yucatán Peninsula. The reason why only few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that these served as prestige dialects throughout the Maya region; hieroglyphic texts would have been composed in the language of the elite.

Stephen Houston, John Robertson and David Stuart have suggested that the specific variety of Chʼolan found in the majority of Southern Lowland glyphic texts was a language they dub &quot;Classic Chʼoltiʼan&quot;, the ancestor language of the modern Chʼortiʼ and Chʼoltiʼ languages. They propose that it originated in western and south-central Petén Basin, and that it was used in the inscriptions and perhaps also spoken by elites and priests. However, Mora-Marín has argued that traits shared by Classic Lowland Maya and the Chʼoltiʼan languages are retentions rather than innovations, and that the diversification of Chʼolan in fact post-dates the classic period. The language of the classical lowland inscriptions then would have been proto-Chʼolan.

===Colonial period===
During the Spanish colonization of Central America, all indigenous languages were eclipsed by Spanish, which became the new prestige language. The use of Mayan languages came to an end in many important domains of society, including administration, religion and literature. Yet the Maya area was more resistant to outside influence than others, and perhaps for this reason, many Maya communities still retain a high proportion of monolingual speakers. The Maya area is now dominated by the Spanish language. While a number of Mayan languages are moribund or are considered endangered, others remain quite viable, with speakers across all age groups and native language use in all domains of society.

===Modern period===

As Maya archaeology advanced during the 20th century and nationalist and ethnic-pride-based ideologies spread, the Mayan-speaking peoples began to develop a shared ethnic identity as Maya, the heirs of the Maya civilization.

The word &quot;Maya&quot; was likely derived from the postclassical Yucatán city of Mayapan; its more restricted meaning in pre-colonial and colonial times points to an origin in a particular region of the Yucatán Peninsula. The broader meaning of &quot;Maya&quot; now current, while defined by linguistic relationships, is also used to refer to ethnic or cultural traits. Most Maya identify first and foremost with a particular ethnic group, e.g. as &quot;Yucatec&quot; or &quot;Kʼicheʼ&quot;; but they also recognize a shared Maya kinship. Language has been fundamental in defining the boundaries of that kinship. Fabri writes: &quot;The term Maya is problematic because Maya peoples do not constitute a homogeneous identity. Maya, rather, has become a strategy of self-representation for the Maya movements and its followers. The Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG) finds twenty-one distinct Mayan languages.&quot; This pride in unity has led to an insistence on the distinctions of different Mayan languages, some of which are so closely related that they could easily be referred to as dialects of a single language. But, given that the term &quot;dialect&quot; has been used by some with racialist overtones in the past, as scholars made a spurious distinction between Amerindian &quot;dialects&quot; and European &quot;languages&quot;, the preferred usage in Mesoamerica in recent years has been to designate the linguistic varieties spoken by different ethnic group as separate languages.

In Guatemala, matters such as developing standardized orthographies for the Mayan languages are governed by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG; Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages), which was founded by Maya organisations in 1986. Following the 1996 peace accords, it has been gaining a growing recognition as the regulatory authority on Mayan languages both among Mayan scholars and the Maya peoples.

==Genealogy and classification==
===Relations with other families===
The Mayan language family has no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families. Similarities with some languages of Mesoamerica are understood to be due to diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into Mayan and not to common ancestry. Mesoamerica has been proven to be an area of substantial linguistic diffusion.

A wide range of proposals have tried to link the Mayan family to other language families or isolates, but none is generally supported by linguists. Examples include linking Mayan with the Uru–Chipaya languages, Mapuche, the Lencan languages, Purépecha, and Huave. Mayan has also been included in various Hokan, Penutian, and Siouan hypotheses. The linguist Joseph Greenberg included Mayan in his highly controversial Amerind hypothesis, which is rejected by most historical linguists as unsupported by available evidence.

Writing in 1997, Lyle Campbell, an expert in Mayan languages and historical linguistics, argued that the most promising proposal is the &quot;Macro-Mayan&quot; hypothesis, which posits links between Mayan, the Mixe–Zoque languages and the Totonacan languages, but more research is needed to support or disprove this hypothesis. In 2015, Campbell noted that recent evidence presented by David Mora-Marin makes the case for a relationship between Mayan and Mixe-Zoquean languages &quot;much more plausible&quot;.

===Subdivisions===
The Mayan family consists of thirty languages. Typically, these languages are grouped into 5–6 major subgroups (Yucatecan, Huastecan, Chʼolan–Tzeltalan, Qʼanjobʼalan, Mamean, and Kʼichean).
The Mayan language family is extremely well documented, and its internal genealogical classification scheme is widely accepted and established, except for some minor unresolved differences.

One point still at issue is the position of Chʼolan and Qʼanjobalan–Chujean. Some scholars think these form a separate Western branch (as in the diagram below). Other linguists do not support the positing of an especially close relationship between Chʼolan and Qʼanjobalan–Chujean; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language. An alternative proposed classification groups the Huastecan branch as springing from the Chʼolan–Tzeltalan node, rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-Mayan node.

==Distribution==

Studies estimate that Mayan languages are spoken by more than six million people. Most of them live in Guatemala where, depending on estimates, 40%–60% of the population speaks a Mayan language. In Mexico the Mayan speaking population was estimated at 2.5 million people in 2010, whereas the Belizean speaker population figures around 30,000.

===Western branch===
The Chʼolan languages were formerly widespread throughout the Maya area, but today the language with most speakers is Chʼol, spoken by 130,000 in Chiapas. Its closest relative, the Chontal Maya language, is spoken by 55,000 in the state of Tabasco. Another related language, now endangered, is Chʼortiʼ, which is spoken by 30,000 in Guatemala. It was previously also spoken in the extreme west of Honduras and El Salvador, but the Salvadorian variant is now extinct and the Honduran one is considered moribund. Chʼoltiʼ, a sister language of Chʼortiʼ, is also extinct. Chʼolan languages are believed to be the most conservative in vocabulary and phonology, and are closely related to the language of the Classic-era inscriptions found in the Central Lowlands. They may have served as prestige languages, coexisting with other dialects in some areas. This assumption provides a plausible explanation for the geographical distance between the Chʼortiʼ zone and the areas where Chʼol and Chontal are spoken.

The closest relatives of the Chʼolan languages are the languages of the Tzeltalan branch, Tzotzil and Tzeltal, both spoken in Chiapas by large and stable or growing populations (265,000 for Tzotzil and 215,000 for Tzeltal). Tzeltal has tens of thousands of monolingual speakers.

Qʼanjobʼal is spoken by 77,700 in Guatemala&#x27;s Huehuetenango department, with small populations elsewhere. The region of Qʼanjobalan speakers in Guatemala, due to genocidal policies during the Civil War and its close proximity to the Mexican border, was the source of a number of refugees. Thus there are now small Qʼanjobʼal, Jakaltek, and Akatek populations in various locations in Mexico, the United States (such as Tuscarawas County, Ohio and Los Angeles, California), and, through postwar resettlement, other parts of Guatemala. Jakaltek (also known as Poptiʼ) is spoken by almost 100,000 in several municipalities of Huehuetenango. Another member of this branch is Akatek, with over 50,000 speakers in San Miguel Acatán and San Rafael La Independencia.

Chuj is spoken by 40,000 people in Huehuetenango, and by 9,500 people, primarily refugees, over the border in Mexico, in the municipality of La Trinitaria, Chiapas, and the villages of Tziscau and Cuauhtémoc. Tojolabʼal is spoken in eastern Chiapas by 36,000 people.

===Eastern branch===
The Quichean–Mamean languages and dialects, with two sub-branches and three subfamilies, are spoken in the Guatemalan highlands.

Qʼeqchiʼ (sometimes spelled Kekchi), which constitutes its own sub-branch within Quichean–Mamean, is spoken by about 800,000 people in the southern Petén, Izabal and Alta Verapaz departments of Guatemala, and also in Belize by 9,000 speakers. In El Salvador it is spoken by 12,000 as a result of recent migrations.

The Uspantek language, which also springs directly from the Quichean–Mamean node, is native only to the Uspantán &quot;municipio&quot; in the department of El Quiché, and has 3,000 speakers.

Within the Quichean sub-branch Kʼicheʼ (Quiché), the Mayan language with the largest number of speakers, is spoken by around 1,000,000 Kʼicheʼ Maya in the Guatemalan highlands, around the towns of Chichicastenango and Quetzaltenango and in the Cuchumatán mountains, as well as by urban emigrants in Guatemala City. The famous Maya mythological document, &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, is written in an antiquated Kʼicheʼ often called Classical Kʼicheʼ (or Quiché). The Kʼicheʼ culture was at its pinnacle at the time of the Spanish conquest. Qʼumarkaj, near the present-day city of Santa Cruz del Quiché, was its economic and ceremonial center. Achi is spoken by 85,000 people in Cubulco and Rabinal, two &quot;municipios&quot; of Baja Verapaz. In some classifications, e.g. the one by Campbell, Achi is counted as a form of Kʼicheʼ. However, owing to a historical division between the two ethnic groups, the Achi Maya do not regard themselves as Kʼicheʼ. The Kaqchikel language is spoken by about 400,000 people in an area stretching from Guatemala City westward to the northern shore of Lake Atitlán. Tzʼutujil has about 90,000 speakers in the vicinity of Lake Atitlán. Other members of the Kʼichean branch are Sakapultek, spoken by about 15,000 people mostly in El Quiché department, and Sipakapense, which is spoken by 8,000 people in Sipacapa, San Marcos.

The largest language in the Mamean sub-branch is Mam, spoken by 478,000 people in the departments of San Marcos and Huehuetenango. Awakatek is the language of 20,000 inhabitants of central Aguacatán, another municipality of Huehuetenango. Ixil (possibly three different languages) is spoken by 70,000 in the &quot;Ixil Triangle&quot; region of the department of El Quiché. Tektitek (or Teko) is spoken by over 6,000 people in the municipality of Tectitán, and 1,000 refugees in Mexico. According to the Ethnologue the number of speakers of Tektitek is growing.

The Poqom languages are closely related to Core Quichean, with which they constitute a Poqom-Kʼichean sub-branch on the Quichean–Mamean node. Poqomchiʼ is spoken by 90,000 people in Purulhá, Baja Verapaz, and in the following municipalities of Alta Verapaz: Santa Cruz Verapaz, San Cristóbal Verapaz, Tactic, Tamahú and Tucurú. Poqomam is spoken by around 49,000 people in several small pockets in Guatemala.

===Yucatecan branch===

Yucatec Maya (known simply as &quot;Maya&quot; to its speakers) is the most commonly spoken Mayan language in Mexico. It is currently spoken by approximately 800,000 people, the vast majority of whom are to be found on the Yucatán Peninsula. It remains common in Yucatán and in the adjacent states of Quintana Roo and Campeche.

The other three Yucatecan languages are Mopan, spoken by around 10,000 speakers primarily in Belize; Itzaʼ, an extinct or moribund language from Guatemala&#x27;s Petén Basin; and Lacandón or Lakantum, also severely endangered with about 1,000 speakers in a few villages on the outskirts of the Selva Lacandona, in Chiapas.

===Huastecan branch===
Wastek (also spelled Huastec and Huaxtec) is spoken in the Mexican states of Veracruz and San Luis Potosí by around 110,000 people. It is the most divergent of modern Mayan languages. Chicomuceltec was a language related to Wastek and spoken in Chiapas that became extinct some time before 1982.

==Phonology==

===Proto-Mayan sound system===
Proto-Mayan (the common ancestor of the Mayan languages as reconstructed using the comparative method) has a predominant CVC syllable structure, only allowing consonant clusters across syllable boundaries. Most Proto-Mayan roots were &quot;monosyllabic&quot; except for a few disyllabic nominal roots.
Due to subsequent vowel loss, many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at both ends of syllables. Following the reconstruction of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It has been suggested that proto-Mayan was a tonal language, based on the fact that four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mochoʼ), but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated tone in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.

===Phonological evolution of Proto-Mayan===

The classification of Mayan languages is based on changes shared between groups of languages. For example, languages of the western group (such as Huastecan, Yucatecan and Chʼolan) all changed the Proto-Mayan phoneme * into , some languages of the eastern branch retained (Kʼichean), and others changed it into or, word-finally, (Mamean). The shared innovations between Huastecan, Yucatecan and Chʼolan show that they separated from the other Mayan languages before the changes found in other branches had taken place.

The palatalized plosives and are not found in most of the modern families. Instead they are reflected differently in different branches, allowing a reconstruction of these phonemes as palatalized plosives. In the eastern branch (Chujean-Qʼanjobalan and Chʼolan) they are reflected as and . In Mamean they are reflected as and and in Quichean as and . Yucatec stands out from other western languages in that its palatalized plosives are sometimes changed into and sometimes .

The Proto-Mayan velar nasal * is reflected as in the eastern branches (Quichean–Mamean), in Qʼanjobalan, Chʼolan and Yucatecan, in Huastecan, and only conserved as in Chuj and Jakaltek.

===Diphthongs===
Vowel quality is typically classified as having monophthongal vowels. In traditionally diphthongized contexts, Mayan languages will realize the V-V sequence by inserting a hiatus-breaking glottal stop or glide insertion between the vowels. Some Kʼichean-branch languages have exhibited developed diphthongs from historical long vowels, by breaking /e:/ and /o:/.

==Grammar==
The morphology of Mayan languages is simpler than that of other Mesoamerican languages, yet its morphology is still considered agglutinating and polysynthetic. Verbs are marked for aspect or tense, the person of the subject, the person of the object (in the case of transitive verbs), and for plurality of person. Possessed nouns are marked for person of possessor. In Mayan languages, nouns are not marked for case, and gender is not explicitly marked.

===Word order===
Proto-Mayan is thought to have had a basic verb–object–subject word order with possibilities of switching to VSO in certain circumstances, such as complex sentences, sentences where object and subject were of equal animacy and when the subject was definite. Today Yucatecan, Tzotzil and Tojolabʼal have a basic fixed VOS word order. Mamean, Qʼanjobʼal, Jakaltek and one dialect of Chuj have a fixed VSO one. Only Chʼortiʼ has a basic SVO word order. Other Mayan languages allow both VSO and VOS word orders.

===Numeral classifiers===
In many Mayan languages, counting requires the use of numeral classifiers, which specify the class of items being counted; the numeral cannot appear without an accompanying classifier. Some Mayan languages, such as Kaqchikel, do not use numeral classifiers. Class is usually assigned according to whether the object is animate or inanimate or according to an object&#x27;s general shape. Thus when counting &quot;flat&quot; objects, a different form of numeral classifier is used than when counting round things, oblong items or people. In some Mayan languages such as Chontal, classifiers take the form of affixes attached to the numeral; in others such as Tzeltal, they are free forms. Jakaltek has both numeral classifiers and noun classifiers, and the noun classifiers can also be used as pronouns.

The meaning denoted by a noun may be altered significantly by changing the accompanying classifier. In Chontal, for example, when the classifier &quot;-tek&quot; is used with names of plants it is understood that the objects being enumerated are whole trees. If in this expression a different classifier, &quot;-tsʼit&quot; (for counting long, slender objects) is substituted for &quot;-tek&quot;, this conveys the meaning that only sticks or branches of the tree are being counted:

===Possession===
The morphology of Mayan nouns is fairly simple: they inflect for number (plural or singular), and, when possessed, for person and number of their possessor. Pronominal possession is expressed by a set of possessive prefixes attached to the noun, as in Kaqchikel &quot;ru-kej&quot; &quot;his/her horse&quot;. Nouns may furthermore adopt a special form marking them as possessed. For nominal possessors, the possessed noun is inflected as possessed by a third-person possessor, and followed by the possessor noun, e.g. Kaqchikel &quot;ru-kej ri achin&quot; &quot;the man&#x27;s horse&quot; (literally &quot;his horse the man&quot;). This type of formation is a main diagnostic trait of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area and recurs throughout Mesoamerica.

Mayan languages often contrast alienable and inalienable possession by varying the way the noun is (or is not) marked as possessed. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts inalienably possessed &#x27; &quot;my photo (in which I am depicted)&quot; with alienably possessed &#x27; &quot;my photo (taken by me)&quot;. The prefix &quot;we-&quot; marks the first person singular possessor in both, but the absence of the &quot;-e&quot; possessive suffix in the first form marks inalienable possession.

===Relational nouns===
Mayan languages which have prepositions at all normally have only one. To express location and other relations between entities, use is made of a special class of &quot;relational nouns&quot;. This pattern is also recurrent throughout Mesoamerica and is another diagnostic trait of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area. In Mayan most relational nouns are metaphorically derived from body parts so that &quot;on top of&quot;, for example, is expressed by the word for &quot;head&quot;.

===Subjects and objects===
Mayan languages are ergative in their alignment. This means that the subject of an intransitive verb is treated similarly to the object of a transitive verb, but differently from the subject of a transitive verb.

Mayan languages have two sets of affixes that are attached to a verb to indicate the person of its arguments. One set (often referred to in Mayan grammars as set B) indicates the person of subjects of intransitive verbs, and of objects of transitive verbs. They can also be used with adjective or noun predicates to indicate the subject.
Another set (set A) is used to indicate the person of subjects of transitive verbs (and in some languages, such as Yucatec, also the subjects of intransitive verbs, but only in the incompletive aspects), and also the possessors of nouns (including relational nouns).
===Verbs===
In addition to subject and object (agent and patient), the Mayan verb has affixes signalling aspect, tense, and mood as in the following example:

Tense systems in Mayan languages are generally simple. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts only past and non-past, while Mam has only future and non-future. Aspect systems are normally more prominent. Mood does not normally form a separate system in Mayan, but is instead intertwined with the tense/aspect system. Kaufman has reconstructed a tense/aspect/mood system for proto-Mayan that includes seven aspects: incompletive, progressive, completive/punctual, imperative, potential/future, optative, and perfective.

Mayan languages tend to have a rich set of grammatical voices. Proto-Mayan had at least one passive construction as well as an antipassive rule for downplaying the importance of the agent in relation to the patient. Modern Kʼicheʼ has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus to the object and another that emphasizes the verbal action. Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: mediopassive, incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of applicative promoting an indirect argument such as a benefactive or recipient to the object position).

===Statives and positionals===
In Mayan languages, statives are a class of predicative words expressing a quality or state, whose syntactic properties fall in between those of verbs and adjectives in Indo-European languages. Like verbs, statives can sometimes be inflected for person but normally lack inflections for tense, aspect and other purely verbal categories. Statives can be adjectives, positionals or numerals.

Positionals, a class of roots characteristic of, if not unique to, the Mayan languages, form stative adjectives and verbs (usually with the help of suffixes) with meanings related to the position or shape of an object or person. Mayan languages have between 250 and 500 distinct positional roots:

In these three Qʼanjobʼal sentences, the positionals are &quot;telan&quot; (&quot;something large or cylindrical lying down as if having fallen&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;person sitting on a chairlike object&quot;), and &#x27; (&quot;curled up like a rope or snake&quot;).

===Word formation===
Compounding of noun roots to form new nouns is commonplace; there are also many morphological processes to derive nouns from verbs. Verbs also admit highly productive derivational affixes of several kinds, most of which specify transitivity or voice.

As in other Mesoamerican languages, there is a widespread metaphorical use of roots denoting body parts, particularly to form locatives and relational nouns, such as Kaqchikel &quot;-pan&quot; (&quot;inside&quot; and &quot;stomach&quot;) or &quot;-wi&quot; (&quot;head-hair&quot; and &quot;on top of&quot;).

==Mayan loanwords==
A number of loanwords of Mayan or potentially Mayan origins are found in many other languages, principally Spanish, English, and some neighboring Mesoamerican languages. In addition, Mayan languages borrowed words, especially from Spanish.

A Mayan loanword is &quot;cigar&quot;. The Mayan word for &quot;tobacco&quot; is and means &quot;to smoke tobacco leaves&quot;. This is the most likely origin for cigar and thus cigarette.

The English word &quot;hurricane&quot;, which is a borrowing from the Spanish word is considered by some to be related to the name of Maya storm deity Jun Raqan. However, it is more likely that the word passed into European languages from the Island Carib language or Taíno.

==Writing systems==

 The complex script used to write Mayan languages in pre-Columbian times and known today from engravings at several Maya archaeological sites has been deciphered almost completely. The script is a mix between a logographic and a syllabic system.

In colonial times Mayan languages came to be written in a script derived from the Latin alphabet; orthographies were developed mostly by missionary grammarians. Not all modern Mayan languages have standardized orthographies, but the Mayan languages of Guatemala use a standardized, Latin-based phonemic spelling system developed by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG). Orthographies for the languages of Mexico are currently being developed by the Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas (INALI).

===Glyphic writing===


The pre-Columbian Maya civilization developed and used an intricate and fully functional writing system, which is the only Mesoamerican script that can be said to be almost fully deciphered. Earlier-established civilizations to the west and north of the Maya homelands that also had scripts recorded in surviving inscriptions include the Zapotec, Olmec, and the Zoque-speaking peoples of the southern Veracruz and western Chiapas area—but their scripts are as yet largely undeciphered. It is generally agreed that the Maya writing system was adapted from one or more of these earlier systems. A number of references identify the undeciphered Olmec script as its most likely precursor.

In the course of the deciphering of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or &quot;graphemes&quot;) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe would have been able to write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.

At least two major Mayan languages have been confidently identified in hieroglyphic texts, with at least one other language probably identified. An archaic language variety known as Classic Maya predominates in these texts, particularly in the Classic-era inscriptions of the southern and central lowland areas. This language is most closely related to the Chʼolan branch of the language family, modern descendants of which include Chʼol, Chʼortiʼ and Chontal. Inscriptions in an early Yucatecan language (the ancestor of the main surviving Yucatec language) have also been recognised or proposed, mainly in the Yucatán Peninsula region and from a later period. Three of the four extant Maya codices are based on Yucatec. It has also been surmised that some inscriptions found in the Chiapas highlands region may be in a Tzeltalan language whose modern descendants are Tzeltal and Tzotzil. Other regional varieties and dialects are also presumed to have been used, but have not yet been identified with certainty.

Use and knowledge of the Maya script continued until the 16th century Spanish conquest at least. Bishop Diego de Landa Calderón of the Catholic Archdiocese of Yucatán prohibited the use of the written language, effectively ending the Mesoamerican tradition of literacy in the native script. He worked with the Spanish colonizers to destroy the bulk of Mayan texts as part of his efforts to convert the locals to Christianity and away from what he perceived as pagan idolatry. Later he described the use of hieroglyphic writing in the religious practices of Yucatecan Maya in his &quot;Relación de las cosas de Yucatán&quot;.

===Colonial orthography===
Colonial orthography is marked by the use of &quot;c&quot; for /k/ (always hard, as in &quot;cic&quot; /kiik/), &quot;k&quot; for /q/ in Guatemala or for /kʼ/ in the Yucatán, &quot;h&quot; for /x/, and &quot;tz&quot; for /ts/; the absence of glottal stop or vowel length (apart sometimes for a double vowel letter for a long glottalized vowel, as in &quot;uuc&quot; /uʼuk/), the use of &quot;u&quot; for /w/, as in &quot;uac&quot; /wak/, and the variable use of &quot;z, ç, s&quot; for /s/. The greatest difference from modern orthography, however, is in the various attempts to transcribe the ejective consonants.

About 1550, Francisco de la Parra invented distinctive letters for ejectives in the Mayan languages of Guatemala, the &quot;tresillo&quot; and &quot;cuatrillo&quot; (and derivatives). These were used in all subsequent Franciscan writing, and are occasionally seen even today [2005]. In 1605, Alonso Urbano doubled consonants for ejectives in Otomi (&quot;pp, tt, ttz, cc / cqu&quot;), and similar systems were adapted to Mayan. Another approach, in Yucatec, was to add a bar to the letter, or to double the stem.
*Only the stem of is doubled, but that is not supported by Unicode.

A ligature for is used alongside and . The Yucatec convention of for is retained in Maya family names such as Dzib.

===Modern orthography===
Since the colonial period, practically all Maya writing has used a Latin alphabet. Formerly these were based largely on the Spanish alphabet and varied between authors, and it is only recently that standardized alphabets have been established. The first widely accepted alphabet was created for Yucatec Maya by the authors and contributors of the &quot;Diccionario Maya Cordemex&quot;, a project directed by Alfredo Barrera Vásquez and first published in 1980. Subsequently, the Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages (known by its Spanish acronym ALMG), founded in 1986, adapted these standards to 22 Mayan languages (primarily in Guatemala). The script is largely phonemic, but abandoned the distinction between the apostrophe for ejective consonants and the glottal stop, so that ejective and the non-ejective sequence (previously &quot;tʼ &quot;and &quot;t7&quot;) are both written &quot;tʼ.&quot; Other major Maya languages, primarily in the Mexican state of Chiapas, such as Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Chʼol, and Tojolabʼal, are not generally included in this reformation, and are sometimes written with the conventions standardized by the Chiapan &quot;State Center for Indigenous Language, Art, and Literature&quot; (CELALI), which for instance writes &quot;ts&quot; rather than &quot;tz&quot; (thus Tseltal and Tsotsil).

For the languages that make a distinction between palato-alveolar and retroflex affricates and fricatives (Mam, Ixil, Tektitek, Awakatek, Qʼanjobʼal, Poptiʼ, and Akatek in Guatemala, and Yucatec in Mexico) the ALMG suggests the following set of conventions.

==Literature==
From the classic language to the present day, a body of literature has been written in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, conquest and calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as codices made of bark, only four of which have survived the ravages of time and the campaign of destruction by Spanish missionaries.

Shortly after the Spanish conquest, the Mayan languages began to be written with Latin letters. Colonial-era literature in Mayan languages include the famous &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, a mythico-historical narrative written in 17th century Classical Quiché but believed to be based on an earlier work written in the 1550s, now lost. The &quot;Título de Totonicapán&quot; and the 17th century theatrical work the &quot;Rabinal Achí&quot; are other notable early works in Kʼicheʼ, the latter in the Achí dialect. The &quot;Annals of the Cakchiquels&quot; from the late 16th century, which provides a historical narrative of the Kaqchikel, contains elements paralleling some of the accounts appearing in the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;. The historical and prophetical accounts in the several variations known collectively as the books of Chilam Balam are primary sources of early Yucatec Maya traditions. The only surviving book of early lyric poetry, the Songs of Dzitbalche by Ah Bam, comes from this same period.

In addition to these singular works, many early grammars of indigenous languages, called &quot;artes&quot;, were written by priests and friars. Languages covered by these early grammars include Kaqchikel, Classical Quiché, Tzeltal, Tzotzil and Yucatec. Some of these came with indigenous-language translations of the Catholic catechism.

While Mayan peoples continued to produce a rich oral literature in the postcolonial period (after 1821), very little written literature was produced in this period.

Because indigenous languages were excluded from the education systems of Mexico and Guatemala after independence, Mayan peoples remained largely illiterate in their native languages, learning to read and write in Spanish, if at all. However, since the establishment of the Cordemex and the Guatemalan Academy of Mayan Languages (1986), native language literacy has begun to spread and a number of indigenous writers have started a new tradition of writing in Mayan languages. Notable among this new generation is the Kʼicheʼ poet Humberto Ak&#x27;abal, whose works are often published in dual-language Spanish/Kʼicheʼ editions, as well as Kʼicheʼ scholar Luis Enrique Sam Colop (1955–2011) whose translations of the Popol Vuh into both Spanish and modern Kʼicheʼ achieved high acclaim.

<text>Hemer is a town in the Märkischer Kreis district, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

== Geography ==
Hemer is located at the north end of the Sauerland near the Ruhr river. The highest elevation, at , is in the &quot;Balver Wald&quot; in the south of the city. The lowest elevation, at , is at the &quot;Edelburg&quot; in the northeast.

== History ==
Burial mounds show that around 1250 BC, Bronze Age shepherds and farmers lived in the area. Graves from the time of the Merovingian Franks around the year 650 were found near the present city centre.

Hemer was first mentioned in 1072 by its old name &quot;Hademare&quot; in a document of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, granting lands to the newly founded Benedictine Grafschaft Abbey, including St. Vitus&#x27;s church and two farms, the later &quot;:de:Haus Hemer&quot; and the &quot;:de:Hedhof&quot;. In 1124 the parish of St. Vitus was separated from the parish of Menden.

Hemer remained an unimportant settlement without market rights, even when the Counts of the Mark gained independence from the episcopal state of Cologne in the 13th century, when Hemer found itself on the boundary of the two states. But despite the political insignificance of the &quot;Kirchspiel Hemer&quot; (&quot;Hemer parish&quot;), it was already quite densely settled, thanks to its location on the old road from the Rhineland to Middle Germany (now &quot;Bundesstrasse&quot; 7), and to the iron mining and smelting industries already developed here. The boundary with Cologne, formed by the valley of the Hönne river southeast of Hemer, was protected by Klusenstein Castle, built in 1353. Local government in the parish of Hemer was the responsibility of the &quot;Amt&quot; of Iserlohn until 1647, when it was transferred to the family of Wachtendonk, who owned Haus Hemer at that time.

The Reformation reached Hemer in the second half of the 16th century, when the Church of St. Vitus (Hemer) () became Protestant (it was demolished in 1818, and replaced by the new &quot;Ebbergkirche&quot; nearby, built in 1819/20). Between 1697 and 1700 , the bishop of Hildesheim and a relative of the new owners of Haus Hemer, built the church of Saints Peter and Paul in Baroque style as the new church for the Roman Catholics.

During the Napoleonic period Hemer was a &quot;mairie&quot; in the &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Hagen in the &quot;département&quot; of the Ruhr of the Napoleonic satellite Grand Duchy of Berg.

===Creation of Amt Hemer===
On October 31, 1841, the &quot;Amt Hemer&quot; was created by 14 municipalities previously administered by the &quot;Landbezirk Iserlohn&quot;. It originally consisted of the municipalities of de:Becke, :de:Brockhausen, :de:Calle, :de:Deilinghofen, :de:Evingsen, :de:Frönsberg, :de:Ihmert, :de:Kesbern, :de:Landhausen, :de:Lössel, :de:Niederhemer, :de:Oberhemer, :de:Sundwig and :de:Westig, as well as the manors (&quot;Rittergut&quot;) of Edelburg, Haus Hemer and Klusenstein. The &quot;Amt&quot; was part of the &quot;Kreis Iserlohn&quot;. In 1910 Niederhemer and Oberhemer were merged into Hemer. In 1920 Lössel became part of the &quot;Amt Oestrich&quot;.

===Communal reform of 1929===

The three industrial municipalities of Hemer, Sundwig and Westig had already grown into a single urban area by World War I. The idea of merging the three municipalities had already been mooted before the war, but due to the war it was not until 1920 that it was formally proposed. However, neither Sundwig nor Westig was initially enthusiastic and both later opposed the merger, mostly because the industrialists in the two places were worried that the tax rates would rise to the higher rates of Hemer. At the same time the city of Iserlohn unsuccessfully tried to incorporate several municipalities: Letmathe and Oestrich to the west, and also the industrial municipalities of the Amt Hemer. Because of the opposition, the merger of the three municipalities was delayed until 1929, when it was carried out by order of the Prussian Ministry of the Interior. At the same time the municipality of Calle was split into four parts: the northern Griesenbrauck was added to Landhausen; Bilveringsen passed to Hemer; the central part around Wermingsen was incorporated into Iserlohn; and the southern parts passed to Westig. With effect from August 1, 1929, Hemer, Sundwig and Westig, as well as Landhausen and the remains of Calle were merged, covering an area of and having a population of 13,809.

Also with effect from August 1, 1929, the municipality of Brockhausen was incorporated into Deilinghofen. The rural Brockhausen had only 588 inhabitants, and because of its low income was not considered to be financially viable as an independent unit.

On January 30, 1936, the municipality of Hemer received the right to call itself a city (&quot;Stadt&quot;).

===Military===
In 1934 Hemer became a garrison town. In January 1934 it was decided to build three barracks in neighboring Iserlohn, which however was unable also to provide enough free land for a training area. At a meeting in June, land around the village of Apricke was selected, of which 3 km2 was bought by the state in autumn of the same year. The hospital was also inspected and later acquired as a military hospital. This was very welcome to Hemer, as the hospital had turned out to be far too big and too expensive for the Amt, and in this way it was possible later to build a new smaller hospital.

In December 1934 temporary barracks for one battalion were also built in Hemer. On October 30, 1936, an official garrison contract between Hemer and the state was signed, which included the building of permanent barracks. Construction was still unfinished when World War II started in 1939, but was then rushed through and the buildings were reassigned as a prisoner of war camp, the &quot;Stalag VI-A&quot;.
The first Polish POWs arrived in October 1939, and had to sleep on the floor as the beds were still not finished. Inadequate equipment remained a problem throughout the whole of the war, both because the material was needed at the front, and also because the camp was permanently overpopulated. At first the inmates were mostly from Poland and France, but after the beginning of the war with the Soviet Union in 1941 Soviet POWs quickly became the majority.

It is estimated that during the six years of the war more than 200,000 inmates were held in the camp. Those who were capable of forced labour usually lived near their places of work, so the main camp was in a sense a &quot;dying camp&quot; for those who fell ill because of the bad living conditions and the hard labour. At an unconfirmed estimate, about 24,000 POWs were buried in Hemer. The fictional film &quot;Hart&#x27;s War&quot; is set in the camp in early 1945.

After the war the barracks of the Stalag, renamed to &quot;Camp Roosevelt&quot; were at first used as a camp for detaining Nazi prisoners. In 1947, it was renamed &quot;Casernes Ardennes&quot; and were used by the Belgian army till 1955. After the establishment of the German Bundeswehr the barracks became home of a tank battalion in 1957. Originally simply named after its location on the &quot;Jüberg&quot; hill, it received its final name, &quot;Blücher-Kaserne&quot;, in 1964.

In 1953 Canadian troops moved into newly built barracks in Deilinghofen (Forts Macleod and Prince of Wales) as well as two former German barrack complexes in Iserlohn (Forts QuèAppelle and Beausejour). Canadian soldiers and their families resided in two separate locations in Hemer. The main location centered on Berliner Strasse where the school and community center were located. The secondary location centered on Bredde Strasse, the site that was formerly used by the Belgians. In 1970 the Canadian military was transferred to bases in the Black Forest Region (Baden-Baden and Lahr) and most of the former Canadian holdings, including Married Quarters in Hemer, were taken over by British military. In 1994 the British left and the Deilinghofen barracks were converted to civil use with the barracks in Iserlohn either transferred back to the Bundeswehr or also converted to civil use.

Due to the changing duties of the Bundeswehr, tanks are not needed as much as they were during the Cold War. The closure of the barracks was announced in 2004, and on January 23, 2007, the last soldiers left Hemer, 50 years after the Bundeswehr moved into the barracks.

===Communal reform of 1975===
With the reorganization of the districts and municipalities in 1974 the &quot;Amt&quot; was dissolved. Evingsen had already become part of Altena in 1969. In 1974 Kesbern became part of Iserlohn, while the other municipalities of Becke, Deilinghofen, Frönsberg and Ihmert were added to the town of Hemer.

===List of mayors ===
Until 1995 the mayor was an honorary post with only formal duties, while the actual head of administration was the &quot;Stadtdirektor&quot;. This system was introduced in 1946 by the British military government, and was abolished in 1999. However, when Reiner Hermann was forced to resign in 1994, shortly after the new system was adopted, Hemer became the first commune of North Rhine-Westphalia to get a professional mayor in 1995.
==Religion==
As of 2005, 15.982 citizens were Protestants, 11,998 Roman Catholic, and 10,111 have other or no religion.

Five Roman Catholic parishes are located in the city - St. Peter and Paul (Niederhemer, Becke), Christ König (Stadtmitte), St. Peter Canisius (Westig), St. Mary (Bredenbruch, Ihmert) and St. Bonifatius (Sundwig, Deilinghofen). All five parishes work together in a parish cluster (&quot;Pastoralverbund&quot;). They are member of the deanery &quot;Märkisches Sauerland&quot; within the Archdiocese of Paderborn.

== Points of interest ==

The &quot;Heinrichshöhle&quot; is a Devonian limestone cave in Hemer, officially discovered in 1812, but probably known by locals long before. 470m of the cave system are accessible to visitors, with some stalactites and the skeleton of a cave bear on display.

The &quot;Felsenmeer&quot; nearby is a small Karst area, partially created by medieval mining, now located in a beech forest.

Shared with Menden and Balve is the Hönnetal, a narrow valley with some beautiful cliffs carved into the same limestone bedrock by the river Hönne.

== Coat of arms ==
The three golden wolf-hooks are derived from the arms of the Brabeck family, the owners of the manor Haus Hemer. The red and white fess on the left side is derived from the arms of the Counts of the Mark. The current coat of arms of the city was originally used by the &quot;Amt&quot;, but when the &quot;Amt&quot; was dissolved into the city in 1975 the city adopted it. It was chosen because it was heraldically and esthetically more satisfying, but also because the adoption of the coat of arms of the &quot;Amt&quot; symbolized the fact that the enlarged city continues the tradition of the &quot;Amt&quot;. The coat of arms was officially granted on March 16, 1976.
The former coat of arms of the city used the same heraldic elements, but in a different arrangement. The red and white motif was used in the form of a bordure round the whole shield, which was completely black with the three yellow wolf-hooks in the middle. This coat of arms was granted by the president of the province of Westphalia on January 14 (&quot;Amt&quot;) and January 15 (city) 1936.

In 1926 the municipality of Hemer was already planning the creation of a coat of arms. A draft using industrial symbols was made by Treude, but the director of the Prussian state archive in Münster, Professor Ludwig Schmitz-Kallenberg, advised against it. Instead he suggested two designs using the heraldic elements of families of Brabeck and of the Counts of the Mark. Hemer created new drafts using heraldic elements from the arms of previous owners of Haus Hemer (the families Overlacker and Wachtendonck), but in 1928 the topic was discontinued. When it was restarted in the 1930s the original suggestion of Professor Johannes Bauermann of the Prussian state archive was followed, with final artwork by the herald Waldemar Mallek.

In 1939 the other municipalities of the Amt also received coats of arms. All six took the three wolf-hooks as their common symbol, showing their membership in the &quot;Amt&quot;. Becke, Deilinghofen and Frönsberg combined them with coats of arms of former noble families of the municipality, while Evingsen, Ihmert and Kesbern combined them with symbols representing their main industries - shoe making for Evingsen, wire production for Ihmert and agriculture for Kesbern.

== Economics ==
Like most of the northern part of the present Märkischer Kreis, Hemer has a long industrial history. The most important industries in the beginning of the 20th century were wire production and wire manufacturing industries, but also rolling mills, foundries and machine production. Paper production was already declining at that time. In 1927 Hemer and Ihmert together had 27 wire factories - 23.7% of all wire factories in Germany at that time. However, as the factories were rather small the percentage is much less impressive when compared by number of employees.

Hemer was the home of Clarfeld &amp; Springmeyer, founded by Friedrich Clarfeld and Heinrich Springmeyer ca. 1870. In 1931, the name of the firm changed to Clarfeld &amp; Co. KG. They were producers of silver and silverplated tableware into the 1970s.

During the Great Depression as well as in the final part of World War II many companies went into bankruptcy, but even today the industrial sector is above average in Hemer. The worldwide known fittings producers &quot;Grohe&quot; and &quot;Keuco&quot; are based in Hemer.

== Transport ==
Hemer is located on autobahn 46, which has ended in the Iserlohn quarter of Bilveringsen just at the border of the Hemer since 1976. The connection with another section of the A46 at Arnsberg has been delayed ever since, as the original route was supposed to go through a nature reserve in Menden.

Hemer was connected to the railway system on 1 September 1882, when the line from Menden to Hemer was inaugurated. In 1885 the extension to Iserlohn was opened. In 1891 a short track was built as far as Sundwig; it was originally planned that this should be extended to Neuenrade but the extension was never built. Hemer had two railway stations - one in Oberhemer and one in Westig. Because of a significant decline both in passenger numbers and in quantity of goods traffic, the service was wound up, and the last regular train went through Hemer on 27 May 1989. The track to Iserlohn was taken up, while the track to Menden was thereafter only used by the Bundeswehr for transporting their tanks and this traffic ended in 2006.

Besides the regular railway, a narrow-gauge railway using gauge first reached a municipality of the Amt Hemer in 1909, when Buchenwäldchen (Calle) was connected with Iserlohn. It was quickly extended: in 1913 almost all the municipalities of Hemer were connected to the network of the &quot;Westfälische Kleinbahnen AG&quot;. The railway was used both for a tram and for goods transport, with the railway station at Westig serving as the junction between the narrow-gauge and the regular-gauge railway.

Renamed &quot;Iserlohner Kreisbahn AG&quot; in 1942, operations were only briefly interrupted after World War II. In the 1950s however more and more sections of the narrow-gauge railway had to be closed because they were no longer profit-making. The trams were replaced by buses, and trucks made the goods transport obsolete. In 1964 the goods transfer in Westig was closed; the trams had already closed in 1959.

<text>Captain William Hobson (26 September 1792 – 10 September 1842) was an Anglo-Irish officer in the British Royal Navy, who served as the first Governor of New Zealand. He was a co-author of the Treaty of Waitangi.

Hobson was dispatched from London in July 1839, with instructions to take the constitutional steps needed to establish a British colony in New Zealand. He was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor in Sydney (under George Gipps) and arrived in New Zealand on 29 January 1840.

On 5 February 1840, Hobson met with Māori chiefs at Waitangi, and the following morning they signed a treaty by which the chiefs purportedly voluntarily transferred sovereignty to the British Crown in return for guarantees respecting their lands and possessions and their rights as British subjects. Three months later, Hobson proclaimed British sovereignty over the islands of New Zealand. He also selected the site for a new capital, which he named Auckland.

In May 1841, New Zealand was constituted as a separate Crown colony, with Hobson promoted to Governor and Commander in Chief. In his final months Hobson was dogged by poor health which left him detached from political affairs. He died in office in September 1842.

== Early life and naval career ==
William Hobson was born in Waterford, Ireland, the son of Samuel Hobson, a barrister and Martha Jones. He grew up in an Anglo-Irish Anglican family. He attended a (barely) private school, but despite this disadvantage he joined the Royal Navy on 25 August 1803 as a second-class volunteer. He served in the Napoleonic Wars and was later involved in the suppression of piracy in the Caribbean. He became a midshipman in 1806 and some seven years later was a first lieutenant.

In September 1822 merchants at Nassau equipped two sloops to cruise against pirates, with proving officers and seamen to man the sloops. One sloop, with 23 men under the command of a midshipman, encountered a pirate schooner and felucca. The British repulsed the schooner and captured the felucca. Those of the felucca&#x27;s crew who were not killed jumped overboard and were drowned. British casualties amounted to two men killed and seven, including the midshipman, wounded. The second sloop had a worse fortune. The sloop &quot;Whim&quot; was under the command of Lieutenant William Hobson and two midshipmen from &quot;Tyne&quot; when on 29 September a pirate schooner captured her at Guanaha. The pirates held the British captive for several days, treating their prisoners badly, but all the British survived.

Between March 1823 and May 1824 Hobson commanded the schooner , in which he captured several pirate vessels, earning himself the nickname &quot;Lion Hobson&quot;. He was promoted to commander on 18 March 1824 and commanded between 1826 and 1828. In December 1834 he obtained a commission from the First Lord of the Admiralty – George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland – to the East Indies on .

== Australia ==
In 1836, he was ordered to Australia, arriving at Hobart on 5 August 1836, and at Sydney 18 days later. On 18 September 1836, left for Port Phillip District (later Melbourne) conveying Captain William Lonsdale and other officials to the new colony. During the next three months, Hobson and his officers thoroughly surveyed Port Phillip, the northern portion of which, by direction of Governor Sir Richard Bourke, was named Hobsons Bay, after him. (Thus the local government area of the City of Hobsons Bay is indirectly named after him.)

His ship was involved in the founding of the port of Williamstown. He was offered the position of Superintendent of the Bombay Marine at a salary of £2000 a year, but he had taken a liking to Australia and was a candidate for the governorship of Port Phillip, although the salary was not expected to be more than £800 a year.

== New Zealand ==
On 26 May 1837 Hobson sailed to the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, in response to a request for help from James Busby, the British Resident, who felt threatened by wars between Māori tribes. For three months in 1837 Pōmare II (Whiria) fought with Tītore until a peace agreement was negotiated by Tareha. On his return to England in 1838, Hobson submitted a report on New Zealand, in which he proposed establishing British sovereignty over the islands in small pockets similar to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in Canada.

=== Lieutenant-Governor ===

At the time, the British government recognised the sovereignty of the Māori people, as represented in the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand of October 1835. Hobson was appointed lieutenant-governor under the Governor of New South Wales, Sir George Gipps—ratified on 30 July 1839—and British consul to New Zealand—confirmed on 13 August 1839.

On 14 August 1839, Constantine Henry Phipps, 1st Marquess of Normanby issued Hobson with detailed instructions, giving the British government&#x27;s reasons for intervention in New Zealand and directions for the purchase of land &quot;by fair and equal contracts&quot;. The land was later resold to European settlers at a profit to provide for further operations.

Hobson arrived in the Bay of Islands aboard on 29 January 1840 with a small group of officials, including an executive council consisting of Colonial Secretary Willoughby Shortland, Colonial Treasurer George Cooper and Attorney-General Francis Fisher. The legislative council comprised the above officials and three Justices of the Peace. Hobson appointed as three Magistrates, Messrs. Shortland, Johnson, and Matthew.

=== Treaty of Waitangi ===

The Treaty of Waitangi was first proposed by Hobson on his return to Britain from his first visit to New Zealand. Upon arrival in New Zealand, Hobson almost immediately drafted the Treaty of Waitangi together with his secretary James Freeman and James Busby. Busby had previously drafted the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand.

Hobson headed the British signatories. Of the 40 or so Māori chiefs, the Ngāpuhi chief Hōne Heke was the first to sign the treaty. As each chief signed, Hobson said &quot;He iwi tahi tātou&quot;, meaning &quot;We are [now] one people&quot;. To enhance the authority of the treaty eight further copies were made and sent around the country to gather additional signatures. After obtaining signatures to the Treaty at the Bay of Islands (6 February 1840), he travelled to Waitematā Harbour to obtain more signatures and to survey a suitable location for a new capital (he also sent the Deputy Surveyor-General, William Cornwallis Symonds, to other areas to obtain more signatures). After suffering a stroke on 1 March 1840, he was taken back to the Bay of Islands, where he recovered sufficiently to continue work.

On 21 May 1840, in response to the creation of a &quot;republic&quot; by the New Zealand Company settlers of Port Nicholson, who were laying out a new town under the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, Hobson asserted British sovereignty over the whole of New Zealand, despite the incompleteness of the treaty signing. He sent Willoughby Shortland and some soldiers to Port Nicholson on 25 May 1840, and the council of the settlers was disbanded. Their leader, William Wakefield, later travelled to the Bay of Islands to pledge allegiance to the Crown. His suggestion to make Port Nicholson the capital was rejected in favour of Hobson&#x27;s plan for a new town on Waitematā Harbour, to be named Auckland after the Earl of Auckland.

On 11 July 1840, the French frigate &quot;L&#x27;Aube&quot; arrived at the Bay of Islands on its way to Banks Peninsula as part of the settlement plan of the Nanto-Bordelaise Company. Hobson immediately sent two magistrates to Akaroa to establish the British claim to sovereignty by holding courts. Near the end of 1840, the Port Nicholson settlers sent a petition to Queen Victoria calling for Hobson&#x27;s dismissal over his treatment of them. Hobson responded on 26 May 1841 to the Foreign Secretary.

=== Governor ===
In November 1840, the Queen signed a royal charter for New Zealand to become a Crown Colony separate from New South Wales. Hobson was sworn in by the Chief Justice as Governor of New Zealand on 3 May 1841. On the same day, the General Legislative Council came into being, with Hobson in charge of appointing its membership.

Hobson travelled to Wellington in August 1841, where he heard the complaints of settlers and selected magistrates. He then visited Akaroa to settle the French claims. Back in Auckland, he had some difficulty with the Māori, and his government was ridiculed by journalists in Wellington and Auckland. He responded by closing down the &quot;New Zealand Herald and Auckland Gazette&quot;. With his government low on funds, he resorted to issuing unauthorised bills on the British Treasury in 1842. Hobson faced opposition from the &quot;Senate clique&quot; radicals who sent a petition to the Foreign Secretary to have Hobson recalled. One of Hobson&#x27;s last actions was to declare an Auckland Anniversary Day, to mark the anniversary of his arrival in the Bay of Islands.

Hobson suffered a second stroke and died on 10 September 1842, prior to being recalled from office. He was buried in the Symonds Street cemetery in Auckland. 

==Legacy==
Several places in New Zealand are named after Hobson including:
*Hobsonville, Hobson initially considered this to be a potential site for the Government of New Zealand, but after advice from the Surveyor-General of New Zealand, Felton Matthew this idea was rejected. The area was later named after him.
*Hobson Bay
*Mount Hobson, Auckland
*Hobson Hill, a small hill located Northeast of Waitangi, Northland.
*Hobson Street

<doc id="182021" wikidata="Q383459" url="?curid=182021" title="The Slim Shady LP">
<text>The Slim Shady LP is the second studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released through Aftermath Entertainment, WEB Entertainment, and Interscope Records on February 23, 1999. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan, following Eminem&#x27;s recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Eminem himself, alongside Dr. Dre and the Bass Brothers. Featuring West Coast hip-hop, G-funk, and horrorcore musical styles, the majority of &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;″s lyrical content was written from the perspective of Eminem&#x27;s alter ego, named Slim Shady. The alter ego was introduced on his 1997 extended play &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot;, and concluded on his 2024 studio album &quot;The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)&quot;. The album contains cartoonish depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, which Eminem described as horror film-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of the lyrics on the album are considered to be satirical, Eminem also discusses his frustrations of living in poverty.

&quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; debuted at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, just below TLC&#x27;s &quot;FanMail&quot;, and number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It was a critical and commercial success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, dark humor lyrics, and unusual personality. &quot;My Name Is&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single, and became Eminem&#x27;s first entry on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; won Best Rap Album at the 2000 Grammy Awards, while &quot;My Name Is&quot; won Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2000, &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is often mentioned in lists of the greatest albums of all time. While &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;″s success turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on American youth.

== Background ==
Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at the age of 14. In 1996, Eminem released his debut studio album, &quot;Infinite&quot;, which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio being owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label, Web Entertainment. &quot;Infinite&quot; was a commercial failure and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. This experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: &quot;After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, &#x27;You&#x27;re a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don&#x27;t you go into rock &amp; roll?&#x27; All that type of shit started pissing me off.&quot; After the release of &quot;Infinite&quot;, Eminem&#x27;s personal struggles and abuse of methadone and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt.

The failure of &quot;Infinite&quot; inspired Eminem to create the alter ego Slim Shady: &quot;Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it.&quot; Slim Shady served as Eminem&#x27;s vent for his frustration and rage to the world. In the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot;. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot; to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for hip-hop producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. Dr. Dre recalled, &quot;In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, &#x27;Find him. Now. Some urged Dr. Dre not to take a chance on Eminem because he was white. Dr. Dre responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t give a fuck if you&#x27;re purple. If you can kick it, I&#x27;m working with you.&quot;

==Recording==

&quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; was recorded at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since listening to his group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous to work with him on the album: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I&#x27;m just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre.&quot; However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; &quot;Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for&quot;, Eminem recalled. He later said: &quot;Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them.&quot; On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished &quot;My Name Is&quot; in an hour. Three other songs, including &quot;Role Model&quot;, were also recorded that day.

&quot;&#x27;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;, which was formerly featured on the &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot; as &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot;, was re-recorded for &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; to feature his daughter Hailie&#x27;s vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend&#x27;s corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s. He explained, &quot;When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out.&quot; Eminem also said, &quot;When she [Hailie] gets old enough, I&#x27;m going to explain it to her. I&#x27;ll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren&#x27;t getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it.&quot; Eminem asked Marilyn Manson to guest appear on the song, but the singer declined because he felt that the song was &quot;too misogynistic&quot;. The song &quot;Guilty Conscience&quot; contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted Dee Barnes. Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre &quot;fell out of his chair laughing&quot; upon hearing the lyric.

&quot;Ken Kaniff&quot;, a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem&#x27;s breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums. Ken Kaniff would end up appearing in more Eminem albums over the course of his career and was last heard in &quot;The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)&quot;. Another skit, &quot;Bitch&quot;, is an answering machine message in which Zoe Winkler, daughter of actor Henry Winkler, tells a friend that she was disgusted by Eminem&#x27;s music. He met and had dinner with her in order to get permission to use the recording on the album. During the mixing process of &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;, at the same time, Kid Rock was recording his fourth studio album, &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot;; being friends with Kid Rock, Eminem asked Kid Rock to record scratching for Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;Just Don&#x27;t Give A Fuck&quot;, which appears on both &quot;Slim Shady EP&quot; &amp; &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;; in return, Eminem delivered a guest rap verse on Kid Rock&#x27;s song &quot;Fuck Off&quot; for &quot;Devil Without a Cause&quot;.

===Production===

The album&#x27;s production was handled primarily by Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem. The beats have been compared to West Coast hip-hop and G-funk musical styles. Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that &quot;The beats are full of bass-heavy hallucinations and create huge, scary sandboxes that allow Em to play.&quot; According to the staff at IGN, &quot;&#x27;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot; is backed by the &quot;lulling serenity of a super silky groove&quot;. &quot;Cum on Everybody&quot;; which features guest vocals from American singer Dina Rae contains an upbeat dance rhythm, while &quot;My Name Is&quot;, which is built around a sample from British musician Labi Siffre&#x27;s &quot;I Got The...&quot;, features a prominent bassline and psychedelic-style keyboards. &quot;I&#x27;m Shady&quot; was originally written over a Sade track, but after hearing a sample of Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Pusherman&quot; in Ice-T&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;m Your Pusher&quot;, Eminem decided it would be more fitting to use &quot;Pusherman&quot;.

Eminem&#x27;s vocal inflection on the album has been described as a &quot;nasal whine&quot;; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; likened his &quot;calmly sarcastic delivery&quot; to &quot;the early Beastie Boys turned cynical&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, columnist Greg Kot compared the rapper&#x27;s vocals to &quot;Pee-wee Herman with a nasal Midwestern accent&quot;. A skit entitled &quot;Lounge&quot; appears before &quot;My Fault&quot; featuring Eminem and the Bass Brothers imitating rat pack crooners. Jeff Bass came up with the line &quot;I never meant to give you mushrooms&quot; for the skit, which in turn inspired Eminem to write &quot;My Fault&quot;.

==Lyrical themes==

Many of the songs from &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; are written from the perspective of Eminem&#x27;s alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish depictions of violence, which he refers to as &quot;made-up tales of trailer-park stuff&quot;. The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: &quot;Why can&#x27;t people see that records can be like movies? The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren&#x27;t on a screen.&quot; Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, &quot;I have a fairly salty relationship with women ... But most of the time, when I&#x27;m saying shit about women, when I&#x27;m saying &#x27;bitches&#x27; and &#x27;hoes&#x27;, it&#x27;s so ridiculous that I&#x27;m taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don&#x27;t hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.&quot; Despite the album&#x27;s explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word &quot;nigga&quot; on the album, noting, &quot;It&#x27;s not in my vocabulary.&quot; &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; begins with a &quot;Public Service Announcement&quot; introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album&#x27;s explicit lyrical content. Later in the album, a skit entitled &quot;Paul&quot; features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to &quot;tone down&quot; his lyrics.

&quot;Guilty Conscience&quot; is a concept song featuring Dr. Dre. The song focuses on a series of characters who are faced with various situations, while Dr. Dre and Eminem serve as the &quot;angel&quot; and &quot;devil&quot; sides of the characters&#x27; conscience, respectively. The song draws inspiration from a scene in the 1978 comedy film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, in which a man takes advice from an angel and devil on his shoulder while considering raping an unconscious girl at a party. In the film, he ends up deciding not to go through with the rape, but in &quot;Guilty Conscience&quot;, the outcome is unclear. On &quot;My Fault&quot;, Eminem tells the story of a girl who overdoses on psychedelic mushrooms at a rave. &quot;&#x27;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot; features Eminem convincing his infant daughter to assist him in disposing of his wife&#x27;s corpse. It is an epilogue to the song &quot;Kim&quot;, although &quot;&#x27;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot; was released first. Eminem wrote the song at a time in which he felt that Kim was stopping him from seeing his daughter. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic explained that &quot;There have been more violent songs in rap, but few more disturbing, and it&#x27;s not because of what it describes, it&#x27;s how he describes it -- how the perfectly modulated phrasing enhances the horror and black humor of his words.&quot; On the song &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, Eminem discusses his childhood experiences with bullies at school, particularly recalling a traumatic incident where he sustained a serious concussion after he was severely beaten by a bully.

Although many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem&#x27;s frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;, Anthony Bozza of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Eminem as &quot;probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem. His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks.&quot; Eminem was inspired to write &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter&#x27;s birthday. The song bemoans human dependency on money, discussing its ability to brainwash an individual. He illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter, describing himself as &quot;discouraged, hungry, and malnourished.&quot; &quot;If I Had&quot; follows a similar theme, as he describes living on minimum wage and remarks that he is &quot;tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour&quot;. In the song, he expresses his irritation with fitting the &quot;white trash&quot; stereotype.

==Critical reception==

The album was met with critical acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper&#x27;s &quot;expansive vocabulary and vivid imagination&quot;, adding that &quot;Years later, as the shock has faded, it&#x27;s those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they&#x27;re what make &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; one of the great debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the album&#x27;s &quot;unapologetic outrageousness&quot; as a reaction to the &quot;soul positivity&quot; of conscious hip-hop, noting that &quot;&quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes ... Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch.&quot; Soren Baker of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that &quot;He isn&#x27;t afraid to say anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it&#x27;s a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time&quot; but lamented the &quot;sometimes flat production that takes away from the power of Eminem&#x27;s verbal mayhem.&quot;

Many reviewers commented on the album&#x27;s lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of &quot;Popular Communications&quot; states, &quot;Eminem&#x27;s music contains more than its fair share of misogynistic and homophobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn&#x27;t help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away.&quot; Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; enjoyed the record&#x27;s comedic nature, writing &quot;Simply put: Eminem will crack you up&quot;, but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that &quot;the wife-killing jokes of &#x27;97 Bonnie and Clyde&#x27; aren&#x27;t any funnier than Garth Brooks&#x27;, and &#x27;My Fault&#x27; belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record.&quot; Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt that although the album is &quot;sophomoric and uninspired&quot; at times, Eminem&#x27;s &quot;surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least a breath of fresh air in a rap world that&#x27;s despairingly low on new ideas.&quot; Mike Rubin of &quot;Spin&quot; noted that &quot;his scenarios are so far-fetched the songs almost never sound as ugly as they actually are.&quot; Chris Dafoe of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; opined that &quot;Abused by fellow students and teachers, cheated on by his girlfriend, despised by society, Shady goes over the top now and then - or rather way over the top - but Dre&#x27;s lean production, full of strange voice and comic interjections, hold things together.&quot; Reviewing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in 1999, Robert Christgau called the record a &quot;platinum-bound cause celebre&quot; and, despite succumbing to &quot;dull sensationalism&quot; toward the end, Eminem shows &quot;more comic genius than any pop musician since&quot;, possibly, Loudon Wainwright III.&quot;
===Accolades===

At the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the album won Best Rap Album, while &quot;My Name Is&quot; won Best Rap Solo Performance. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; number 275 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and 33 on its list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; as the 352nd greatest album of all time on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 248 in its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;Blender&quot; ranked it number 49 in its list of The 100 Greatest American Albums of All Time. &quot;Ken Kaniff&quot; was listed as number 15 on &quot;Complex&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest Hip-Hop Skits&quot; list, while the &quot;Public Service Announcement&quot; introduction to the album, along with the &quot;Public Service Announcement 2000&quot; introduction from &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;, was listed as number 50 on the list. &quot;Spin&quot; later included it in their list of &quot;The 300 Best Albums of 1985–2014&quot;.

==Legacy and aftermath==

After the success of &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;, Eminem went from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records; the first artist Eminem signed was rapper and his best friend Proof. Eminem, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle: &quot;This last Christmas, there were so many fucking presents under the tree ... My daughter wasn&#x27;t born with a silver spoon in her mouth. But she&#x27;s got one now. I can&#x27;t stop myself from spoiling her.&quot;

To promote &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;, Eminem embarked on an extensive tour schedule. He joined the Vans Warped Tour as a last-minute replacement for Cypress Hill, a schedule that included 31 North American dates from June 25 to July 31, beginning in San Antonio and ending in Miami. He often played a show in the afternoon on the Warped Tour, and then drove to another location to perform at a hip-hop club at night. During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut near the end of the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten feet down off the stage, cracking several ribs. He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, &quot;I knew I had to slow it down. The fall was like a reminder.&quot; However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;.

Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as &quot;misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence&quot;, and in an editorial by &quot;Billboard&quot; editor in chief Timothy White, the writer accused Eminem of &quot;making money by exploiting the world&#x27;s misery.&quot; During a radio interview in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about &quot;slapping a pregnant bitch&quot; to the extent that on air she broke a copy of &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;. The rapper defended himself by saying, &quot;My album isn&#x27;t for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it. That doesn&#x27;t mean younger kids won&#x27;t get it, but I&#x27;m not responsible for every kid out there. I&#x27;m not a role model, and I don&#x27;t claim to be.&quot;

==Lawsuits==
On September 17, 1999, Eminem&#x27;s mother, Debbie Mathers, filed a $10 million lawsuit against him for slander based on his claim that she uses drugs in the line &quot;I just found out my mom does more dope than I do&quot; from &quot;My Name Is&quot;. After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she received $1,600 after legal fees. Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a &quot;lawsuit queen&quot;, and alleging that &quot;That&#x27;s how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don&#x27;t remember her working a day in her life.&quot; She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed.

In December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor living in Roseville, Michigan, who was made the subject of the song &quot;Brain Damage&quot; in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and invasion of privacy. Bailey&#x27;s attorney stated &quot;Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a &#x27;pretender&#x27; in the industry ... Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism.&quot; In 1982, Eminem&#x27;s mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior. Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot;. The lawsuit was dismissed by judge Deborah Servitto in 2003, who wrote her ruling in the form of rap-like rhyme. She ruled that the lyrics—which include the school principal collaborating with Bailey, and Eminem&#x27;s entire brain falling out of his head—were too exaggerated for a listener to believe that they were recalling an actual event. The verdict was upheld in 2005, and Bailey&#x27;s lawyer ruled out any further appeals.

In September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that &quot;Guilty Conscience&quot; contains an unauthorized sample of &quot;Go Home Pigs&quot; composed for the film &quot;Getting Straight&quot; by her husband, Ronald Stein, who died in 1988. Although the album&#x27;s liner notes state that the song contains an interpolation of &quot;Go Home Pigs&quot;, Stein is not credited as a composer and his wife was not paid royalties for use of the song. The lawsuit requested for 5 percent of the retail list price of 90 percent all of the copies of the record sold in America, and 2.5 percent of the retail price of 90 percent of the copies of the album sold internationally. The suit was dismissed in June 2004 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

<text>Felice Orsini (; ; 10 December 1819 – 13 March 1858) was an Italian revolutionary and leader of the &quot;Carbonari&quot; who tried to assassinate Napoleon III, Emperor of the French.

==Early life==
Felice Orsini was born at Meldola in Romagna, then part of the Papal States. He was encouraged to become a priest, but he abandoned that lifestyle and became an ardent liberal, joining the &quot;Giovane Italia&quot;, a political society founded by Giuseppe Mazzini.

==Arrest and revolutionary activities==

Orsini was arrested in 1844 along with his father, implicated in revolutionary plots and condemned to imprisonment for life. The new pope, Pius IX set him free, and he led a company of young Romagnols in the First War of Italian Independence in 1848, distinguishing himself in the engagements at Treviso and Vicenza.

Orsini was elected member of the Roman Constituent Assembly in 1849, and after the fall of the revolutionary republic in Rome, he conspired against the papal autocracy in the interest of the Mazzinian party. Mazzini sent him on a secret mission to Hungary, but he was arrested in 1854 and imprisoned at Mantua. He escaped a few months later using a tiny saw to cut through two grids of bars, climbed out of the window 100 feet above ground and slid down using a rope he had made of bedsheets. Passing as a sympathetic peasant, he managed to get past the Austrian guards.

In 1856, he briefly visited Great Britain and received a favourable welcome. The daily news had published the first English translation of his tale of escape. He published &quot;The Memoirs and Adventures of Felice Orsini&quot; in 1856. In 1857, he also published an account of his prison experiences in English under the title of &quot;The Austrian Dungeons&quot; in Italy, which led to a rupture between him and Mazzini. Then he began to negotiate with Ausonio Franchi, editor of the &quot;Ragione&quot; of Turin, which he proposed to make the organ of pure republicans.

Orsini became convinced that Napoleon III was the chief obstacle to Italian independence and the principal cause of the anti-liberal reaction throughout Europe. He plotted his assassination with the logic that after the emperor&#x27;s death, France would rise in revolt and the Italians could exploit the situation to revolt themselves. He went to Paris in 1857 to conspire against the emperor.

At the end of 1857, Orsini briefly visited England, where he contacted gunsmith Joseph Taylor and asked him to make six copies of a bomb of Orsini&#x27;s own design; it would explode on impact and used fulminate of mercury as an explosive. The bomb was tested in Sheffield and Devon with the aid of French radical Simon Bernard. Satisfied, Orsini returned to Paris with the bombs and contacted other conspirators, Giovanni Andrea Pieri, Antonio Gomez and Carlo di Rudio (later changed to Charles DeRudio).

==Assassination attempt on Louis Napoleon==

On the evening of 14 January 1858, as the Emperor and Empress were on their way to the theatre in the Rue Le Peletier, the precursor of the Opera Garnier, to see Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot;, Orsini and his accomplices threw three bombs at the imperial carriage. The first bomb landed among the horsemen in front of the carriage. The second bomb wounded the animals and smashed the carriage glass. The third bomb landed under the carriage and seriously wounded a policeman who was hurrying to protect the occupants. Eight people were killed and 142 wounded, though the emperor and empress were unhurt. They judged it best to proceed to the performance and appear before the public in their box.

Orsini himself was wounded on the right temple and stunned. He tended his wounds and returned to his lodgings, where police found him the next day.

The attempted assassination actually increased Napoleon III&#x27;s popularity. Because the bombs had been made and tested in England, it caused a brief anti-British furore in France because of suspicion of British involvement. The Emperor refused to escalate the situation and the indignation eventually died down.

==Letter to Napoleon III==
On 11 February Orsini wrote his famous letter to Napoleon, in which he exhorted him to take up the cause of Italian independence—a cause Napoleon III had already supported in his youth. Modern historians have even suspected that Napoleon wrote some of the letter himself. He addressed another letter to the youth of Italy and condemned political assassination.

==Judgment==
Orsini was sentenced to death and went calmly to the guillotine on 13 March 1858. His accomplice Pieri was executed, and Gomez was condemned to hard labour for life. Di Rudio was sentenced to death, which was commuted to life imprisonment on Devil&#x27;s Island near Cayenne, whence he escaped, and he later went to America. He became an infantryman and later an officer in the United States Army, and served in the American Civil War. After the war, he gained a Regular Army commission in the infantry, later switching to the cavalry, and was appointed to the U.S. 7th Cavalry, and participated in—and survived—the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. He served many years in the Army, retiring in the 1890s.

<text>William Frederick Durst (born Frederick Allen Mayne III; August 20, 1970) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, actor, and director. He is the frontman and lyricist of the nu metal band Limp Bizkit, formed in 1994, with whom he has released six studio albums.

Since 2006, Durst has worked on a number of independent films. He co-starred in &quot;Population 436&quot;, and made his directorial debut in 2007 with &quot;The Education of Charlie Banks&quot;. He followed with &quot;The Longshots&quot; in 2008. His latest film, &quot;The Fanatic&quot;, came out in 2019.

==Early life==
Durst was born Frederick Allen Mayne III in Jacksonville, Florida, but soon moved to Orlando and then a farm in Cherryville, North Carolina, at one year old. His mother Anita had him rechristened as William Frederick Durst after remarrying Bill Durst, a local police officer. Shortly after, Durst&#x27;s parents had another child, his half-brother Cory Durst. In the fifth grade, he moved to Gastonia, North Carolina, where he graduated from Hunter Huss High School. As a child, Durst was bullied, which he incorporated into his music. At the age of 12, Durst took an interest in breakdancing, hip hop, punk rock, and heavy metal. He began to rap, skate, beatbox, and DJ. Leaving the Navy after two years (1988–1990), Durst moved back to Jacksonville with his father where he worked as a landscaper and a tattoo artist while developing an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip-hop.

==Career==
===Formation of Limp Bizkit (1994–1998)===
In 1994, Durst, Malachi Sage bassist Sam Rivers, and Rivers&#x27; highschool friend John Otto jammed together and wrote three songs. Guitarist Wes Borland later joined. Durst named the band Limp Bizkit because he wanted a name that would repel listeners. Limp Bizkit developed a cult following in the underground music scene when its covers of George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot; and Paula Abdul&#x27;s &quot;Straight Up&quot; began to attract curious concertgoers.

Later, when Korn performed in town as the opening act for Sick of It All, Durst invited Korn to his house. He was able to persuade bassist Reginald Arvizu to listen to demos of the songs &quot;Pollution&quot;, &quot;Counterfeit&quot;, and &quot;Stalemate&quot;. Korn added a then-unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours, which gave the band a new audience. DJ Lethal, formerly of the hip hop group House of Pain, joined the band as a turntablist. During this time Durst&#x27;s disagreements with Borland led the guitarist to briefly leave the band, but re-join soon after.

In 1997, Limp Bizkit signed with Flip Records, a subsidiary of Interscope Records, and released their debut album, &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; to moderate response. On October 23, 1997, Durst met the band Staind, but friction quickly emerged between the two over the cover art of Staind&#x27;s album. Durst unsuccessfully attempted to remove Staind from a concert bill shortly before their performance, but after hearing the band play, he was so impressed that he signed them to Flip/Elektra, recorded a demo with the band, and co-produced their next album, &quot;Dysfunction&quot;.

After Limp Bizkit finished a tour with the band Deftones, Durst and DJ Lethal were asked by Max Cavalera, formerly of the band Sepultura, to appear on &quot;Bleed&quot;, a song from the self-titled debut of his new band Soulfly. Cavalera stated that producer Ross Robinson recommended that he work with Durst. Durst also made an appearance on Korn&#x27;s album &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;. Jonathan Davis had intended to write a battle rap with B-Real of Cypress Hill, but the latter&#x27;s label wouldn&#x27;t let him do it, and Durst was tapped instead. Davis and Durst wrote the lyrics for &quot;All in the Family&quot;, which featured the two vocalists trading insults. Davis and Durst would often offer suggestions for each other&#x27;s lyrics; a lyric written by Durst as &quot;tootin&#x27; on your bagpipe&quot; was changed to &quot;fagpipes&quot; by Davis, who stated &quot;I helped him bag on me better&quot;.

Durst began to take an interest in filmmaking, directing the music video for Limp Bizkit&#x27;s single &quot;Faith&quot; in promotion for its appearance in the film &quot;Very Bad Things&quot;; he was unsatisfied with it and made a second video which paid tribute to tour mates Primus, Deftones and Mötley Crüe, who appeared in the video.

===Mainstream success (1998–2005)===
Limp Bizkit achieved mainstream success with the albums &quot;Significant Other&quot; (1999) and &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; (2000). In June 1999, Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A&amp;R at Interscope. Durst utilized his connections through the label and scouted numerous bands; landing record deals for Cold, Staind, Puddle of Mudd, and She Wants Revenge. Durst would also aid in attracting other bands such as 30 Seconds to Mars and Taproot, though Durst would pass on 30 Seconds to Mars, and he later engaged in a minor feud with Taproot after they rejected his original offer to sign the group to interscope in 1999.
In the summer of 1999, Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipated Woodstock &#x27;99 festival in front of approximately 200,000 people. The concert was tarnished by violent behavior from the crowd, much of which occurred during and after their performance, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during the song &quot;Break Stuff&quot;. Several sexual assaults were reported in the aftermath of the concert. Durst stated during the concert, &quot;People are getting hurt. Don&#x27;t let anybody get hurt. But I don&#x27;t think you should mellow out. That&#x27;s what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do. If someone falls, pick &#x27;em up. We already let the negative energy out. Now we wanna let out the positive energy&quot;. Durst later stated in an interview, &quot;I didn&#x27;t see anybody getting hurt. You don&#x27;t see that. When you&#x27;re looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you&#x27;re performing, and you&#x27;re feeling your music, how do they expect us to see something bad going on?&quot; Les Claypool told the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, &quot;Woodstock was just Durst being Durst. His attitude is &#x27;no press is bad press&#x27;, so he brings it on himself. He wallows in it. Still, he&#x27;s a great guy.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s easy to point the finger and blame [us], but they hired us for what we do — and all we did is what we do. I would turn the finger and point it back to the people that hired us,&quot; said Durst, in reference to original Woodstock co-founder, Michael Lang.

In June 2000, Limp Bizkit&#x27;s tour was sponsored by the controversial file sharing service Napster. Durst was an outspoken advocate of file sharing. During the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Durst performed Limp Bizkit&#x27;s song &quot;Livin&#x27; It Up&quot;, as a duet with Christina Aguilera. In response to the performance, Filter frontman Richard Patrick claimed that &quot;Fred getting onstage with Christina Aguilera embarrassed us all.&quot; In response to the negative reactions to the performance, Durst remarked, &quot;People always just wanna talk about Britney or Christina. What&#x27;s the problem? Because they make a type of music we aren&#x27;t allowed to like? Or you think they are the nemesis of what our music is about? Why segregate? Why be so musically fuckin&#x27; racist? What do you mean, I can&#x27;t hang out with these types of people? Clearly I didn&#x27;t give a fuck, which fed a lot of it, too. I mean, someone that&#x27;s not going to give in and apologise... it&#x27;s gonna make people carry on talking.&quot;

During a 2001 tour of Australia at the Big Day Out festival in Sydney, fans rushed the stage in the mosh pit, and teenager Jessica Michalik died of asphyxiation. In Auckland, New Zealand, on the same tour, Durst threw water over the head of a security personnel tasked with defusing a similar situation. During the Big Day Out crush, Durst has been accused of taunting security guards intervening in the situation. In court, Durst, represented by his long-time attorney, Ed McPherson, testified he had warned the concert&#x27;s organizers Aaron Jackson, Will Pearce and Amar Tailor and promoter Vivian Lees of the potential dangers of such minimal security. After viewing video and hearing witness testimony, the coroner said it was evident that the density of the crowd was dangerous at the time Limp Bizkit took the stage and Durst should have acted more responsibly when the problem became apparent. Durst stated that he was &quot;emotionally scarred&quot; because of the teenager&#x27;s death.

In 2002, Durst was tapped to write songs for Britney Spears, and later said that he was in a relationship with her. Spears denied Durst&#x27;s claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that &quot;I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.&quot; In February 2005, a sex tape featuring Durst was released on the Internet. Durst filed a $70 million lawsuit against ten websites that posted the video.

In May 2003, it was reported that Durst was working on a New Wave side-project alongside Limp Bizkit&#x27;s Results May Vary album. The band, named Pacifica, was reportedly in its &quot;very early stages&quot; and had a sound reminiscent of Duran Duran and Soft Cell. News about the band stopped quickly and no releases ever surfaced.

In July 2003, Limp Bizkit participated on the Summer Sanitarium Tour, headlined by Metallica. In the days preceding the tour&#x27;s stop in Chicago, local radio personality Mancow Muller mocked Durst and suggested that listeners who were attending the concert should heckle the singer and throw debris. With the crowd chanting &quot;fuck Fred Durst&quot; and pelting the stage with garbage, Durst erupted after six songs, threw the microphone down and walked off stage. Durst was eventually sued for breach of contract (for not completing the show) by Chicago lawyer Michael Young in a class-action suit.

In May 2005, &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot; was released. Sammy Siegler took over drumming duties for the band for much of the album. At Durst&#x27;s insistence, the album was released as an underground album, without any advertising or promotion. The album sold over 2,000,000 copies worldwide, peaking at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Durst later announced that despite the album&#x27;s title, no sequel to &quot;The Unquestionable Truth&quot; would be produced. Later in the year, the band released a &quot;Greatest Hitz&quot; album.

Having been bullied while growing up, Durst disliked seeing people &quot;using my music as fuel to torture other people&quot;; feeling that his music was being misinterpreted, he would later cite this as the reason for the band taking a hiatus.

Durst also said that he created a character for his music, but that he was also misunderstood by the public: &quot;I always knew the guy in the red cap was not me. I&#x27;m Dr Frankenstein and that&#x27;s my creature. Being a breakdancer, a graffiti artist, a tattoo artist and liking rock and hip hop was too much; it was a conscious effort to create Fred Durst and eventually I had to bring that guy out more than I wanted to. It took on a life of its own. I had to check into that character – the gorilla, the thing, the red cap guy. It&#x27;s a painful transformation, but I do it &#x27;cos that&#x27;s what I was taught to do when you have people pulling at you&quot;.

===Start of film career (2006–2009)===
While Limp Bizkit was on hiatus, Durst began working in independent films. In 2006, Durst costarred in the film &quot;Population 436&quot;. His directorial debut, &quot;The Education of Charlie Banks&quot;, was released the following year. The film, which starred Jesse Eisenberg, Chris Marquette and Jason Ritter, received mixed reviews; Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 48% based on reviews from 31 critics. The website&#x27;s consensus stated, &quot;Unevenness and earnestness mire this otherwise sweet, surprising coming of age drama.&quot; A second directorial effort, &quot;The Longshots&quot;, starring Ice Cube and Keke Palmer, was released in 2008. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 41% based on 71 reviews, with the site&#x27;s consensus indicating that the film was &quot;a largely formulaic affair, rarely deviating from the inspirational sports movie playbook.&quot; The same year, Durst appeared as a bartender in two episodes of the television medical drama &quot;House, M.D.&quot;

===Limp Bizkit reunion (2009–present)===
In 2009, the original lineup of Limp Bizkit reunited and began touring. Durst announced that they had begun to record a new album, &quot;Gold Cobra&quot;. The album was released on June 28, 2011, receiving mixed reviews. It peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 2012, Durst appeared on the Insane Clown Posse cover album &quot;Smothered, Covered &amp; Chunked&quot; on a cover of AMG&#x27;s &quot;Bitch Betta Have My Money&quot;. In February 2012, Lil Wayne announced in a radio interview that Limp Bizkit had signed to his label, Cash Money Records, which Durst confirmed on his Twitter page. A few months later Durst was featured alongside Lil Wayne and Birdman on the Kevin Rudolf song &quot;Champions&quot;, which peaked in the top 10 on iTunes.

Originally, Durst was to direct and produce the film &quot;Pawn Shop Chronicles&quot;, starring Paul Walker; but Wayne Kramer was later chosen to direct the film. In 2014, Durst shot three commercials for the website eHarmony, In February 2018, Durst began filming &quot;The Fanatic&quot;, starring John Travolta.

== Personal life ==
While serving in the Navy, Durst was stationed in Oakland, California, where he married his first wife Rachel Tergesen in 1990. They had a daughter named Adriana Durst, born on June 3, 1990. Durst and Tergesen divorced in 1993 following a domestic disturbance in which the couple engaged in a heated argument. Durst was later arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, receiving a fine of $5,000.

Durst has a son named Dallas born August 30, 2001, with his ex-girlfriend, actress Jennifer Thayer.

On July 13, 1999, Durst was arrested for kicking a stage security guard in the head. Durst was released on $50,000 bail and was later fined in exchange for reduced charges.

In 2007, Durst pleaded no-contest to seven misdemeanor charges, including battery, assault and reckless driving. According to court documents, Durst hit two Los Angeles residents with his car on October 25, 2006. He was given a 120-day suspended sentence, 20 hours community service and a $1,500 fine.

In 2009, Durst married Esther Nazarov and split after three months. Durst married his third wife, make-up artist Kseniya Beryazina, in 2012. They filed for divorce in September 2018 and finalized it in 2019. Durst married Arles Durst in 2022.

In 2015, Durst stated his interest in obtaining a Russian passport and spending half of the year in Crimea. On October 8, 2015, the Russian newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot; reported that Durst responded positively to Sergey Aksyonov&#x27;s call to settle in Crimea. He wrote a letter stating that Vladimir Putin is &quot;a great guy with clear moral principles and a nice person&quot;. Additionally, at a concert during the &#x27;Money Sucks Tour&#x27; in Voronezh, Russia, he picked up a flag thrown on stage, which he did not realize had an anti-Ukrainian slogan on it. Because of these controversies, he was banned by the Security Service of Ukraine from entering Ukraine for five years starting in November 2015 &quot;in the interests of guaranteeing the security&quot; of the country. In an official statement, Durst denied reports of asking to acquire Russian citizenship.

During the 2018 California wildfires, Durst&#x27;s house burned down and he lost a majority of his possessions. His bandmate, Wes Borland, also lost several pieces of equipment in the fire due to them being stored in Durst&#x27;s home in anticipation of a scheduled recording session.

Durst is known for regularly wearing a red New York Yankees baseball cap.

==Feuds==
=== Slipknot ===
Following Slipknot lead vocalist Corey Taylor&#x27;s (also known as &quot;#8&quot;) publicly displayed distaste for Korn drummer David Silveria&#x27;s magazine photo campaign for Calvin Klein, Taylor burned copies of the magazine issues during multiple Slipknot live performances, culminating in Durst taking offense to the gestures. It was rumored that Durst would later make retaliatory comments towards Slipknot&#x27;s fans in the spring of 1999, referring to them as &quot;fat, ugly kids&quot;. Durst has denied these comments. Slipknot singer Corey Taylor responded during a February 2000 appearance in Sydney by claiming that the fans of Slipknot &quot;for the most part, enjoy all kinds of music, like Limp Bizkit… maybe.&quot; Taylor went on to claim that insulting fans of Slipknot could also be insulting fans of Limp Bizkit. During an interview with VH1 in October 2000, Durst praised Slipknot&#x27;s music, expressing his desire to quell the tension between both sides, telling interviewers, &quot;Man this band is super phat, man; we don&#x27;t even know them. That&#x27;s their whole thing, that&#x27;s their chant, that&#x27;s their thing, that&#x27;s cool. Maybe all this hate that&#x27;s going around the world, that&#x27;s why I said &#x27;It&#x27;s all the world has even seen lately&#x27;&quot;. However, while Taylor responded with praise for Durst&#x27;s financial ventures, he also attacked Durst&#x27;s artistic motives and ability, claiming &quot;Fred Durst is a great businessman, but he is not an artist&quot;. Despite the hostility between the two bands, they both shared numerous UK festival dates in 2000, with some reports of Durst supporting Slipknot&#x27;s music.

The two would find themselves on friendlier terms in 2010, while Limp Bizkit was recording their album &quot;Gold Cobra&quot;; Durst included lyrics on the album&#x27;s song &quot;90.2.10&quot; as a shout-out to Taylor: &quot;Corey Taylor got a harem chasin&#x27; him around / We ain&#x27;t slippin&#x27; with his knot, then we goin&#x27; down&quot;. Taylor stated in a live interview in 2011 that Durst&#x27;s children were allegedly fans of Slipknot. Limp Bizkit was later booked on the 2014 Japanese leg of Slipknot&#x27;s Knotfest tour, along with Korn.

In 2021, after the death of ex-Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison, Limp Bizkit paid tribute to him at one of their shows. On May 19, 2024, Limp Bizkit brought Slipknot turntablist Sid Wilson and a fan dressed as Slipknot lead vocalist Corey Taylor on stage during their live performance at Sonic Temple Art &amp; Music Festival in Columbus, Ohio.

=== Britney Spears ===
Durst and Britney Spears were linked to have written numerous songs for her then-upcoming 2003 album In the Zone. At the time Spears was making numerous headlines as reports surfaced of her fractured relationship with former boyfriend Justin Timberlake (with whom Spears had split from in 2002), later linking her with Durst as the two were spotted together on numerous occasions. In response to initial allegations that Spears had engaged in an affair with Durst, Timberlake released the track Cry Me a River in November 2002, aimed at Spears. In January 2003, Durst claimed he and Spears were in a relationship stemming from their collaborations on three upcoming tracks for the album. Spears denied the two were in a relationship and said &quot;I&#x27;m confused about that whole thing. We worked together for three days and he&#x27;s a really cool guy, but there&#x27;s no relationship...He&#x27;s really sweet.&quot; Out of anger at Spears&#x27; denial of the affair; Durst scrapped his three songs for Spears&#x27; album and leaked the song &quot;Just Drop Dead&quot; on February 18, 2003, through Limp Bizkit&#x27;s website. The song depicts Durst&#x27;s vulgar recounting of their alleged relationship. Durst continued to expose numerous sexual encounters between the two during a later appearance on Howard Stern. During a 2009 interview, Durst explained that &quot;I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.&quot; In 2013, Durst later made another derogatory reference aimed at Spears on Limp Bizkit&#x27;s song Ready to Go.

=== Taproot and System of a Down ===
Taproot had been an up-and-coming band from Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1998, the band sent their demo to Durst who quickly befriended them, often invited them to various press releases in Los Angeles and occasionally bringing them to Limp Bizkit&#x27;s concerts throughout the region. During this time; Taproot were simultaneously receiving attention from other labels, notably Arista Records and Atlantic Records. Durst was impressed with the band&#x27;s material and had initially lined up Taproot to land a record contract through Interscope; however, executives from Interscope proved to be difficult to negotiate with as they wanted the rights to the 3 songs recorded by the band through their demo deal. The band eventually rejected the offer from Interscope and sought to sign with Atlantic Records through their new found friendship with System of a Down. Durst was enraged to eventually discover Taproot had defected to Atlantic, leading him to leave a threatening message on frontman Stephen Richards&#x27; mother&#x27;s answering machine. Durst was later alleged to have personally removed System of a Down from the 1999 Family Values Tour as a retaliatory action.

=== Creed ===
In June 2000, Limp Bizkit performed at the WXRK Dysfunctional Family Picnic in Holmdel, New Jersey, but arrived an hour late for their set. An Interscope spokesman later stated that there was confusion over the band&#x27;s set time. During the band&#x27;s performance, Durst criticized Creed and their lead singer Scott Stapp in a lengthy diatribe before the performance of &#x27;Break Stuff&#x27;, calling him &quot;an egomaniac&quot;. Creed&#x27;s representatives later presented Durst with an autographed anger management manual following the show, as described by Durst during an appearance on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;.

=== Placebo ===
A feud between Limp Bizkit and Placebo began at a show Durst was hosting at Irving Plaza in December 1998. A side stage spat with Placebo singer Brian Molko led to Durst asking the crowd to chant &quot;Placebo sucks!&quot; prior to Placebo&#x27;s performance. Molko later commented that nobody had told him that Durst would be hosting the show and that Placebo would have to follow opening act Kid Rock. Prior to introducing Staind as a part of K-Rock&#x27;s Dysfunctional Family Picnic in Holmdel, New Jersey in 1999, Durst once again encouraged the crowd to chant &quot;Fuck Placebo&quot;. The feud was reignited during Big Day Out 2001, on which Placebo were billed below Limp Bizkit. By 2004, the feud had supposedly ended.

=== Trent Reznor and Marilyn Manson ===
Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails was noted by Durst as an influence during several interviews. Displeased by Durst&#x27;s statements, Reznor repeatedly attacked Durst and Limp Bizkit to several interviews in response. In a profile for &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Reznor mocked Durst saying &quot;It&#x27;s one thing if you know your place; like, &#x27;Hey, I&#x27;m an idiot who plays shitty music but people buy it – fuck it, I&#x27;m having fun. But it&#x27;s another thing when you think you&#x27;re David Bowie after you&#x27;ve stayed up all night to write a song called &#x27;Break Stuff&#x27;. I mean, Fred Durst probably spelt the word &#x27;break&#x27; wrong the first couple of times. Fred Durst might be a cool guy; I don&#x27;t know him. But his &#x27;art&#x27; – in the word&#x27;s loosest sense – sucks.&quot; Durst in turn made several references to Nine Inch Nails in the Limp Bizkit song &quot;Hot Dog&quot;, leading to Reznor earning a co-writer credit. Reznor said there was no issue, jokingly stating that &quot;When his record was going to print, [Durst] realised &#x27;Fuck, I&#x27;d better ask permission first or I might get sued!&#x27; I let him do it – I wasn&#x27;t gonna hold his record up.&quot;.

In 1999, Marilyn Manson insulted Limp Bizkit and their fans, calling them &quot;illiterate apes that beat your ass in high school for being a &#x27;fag&#x27; and now sell you tuneless testosterone anthems of misogyny and pretend to be outsiders...&quot;.

Reznor and Manson once again took aim at Durst and Limp Bizkit during a 2000 interview when Manson was asked about his opinion of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; recent video for the single Starfuckers, Inc. in which the two take aim at multiple artists ranging from Billy Corgan, Michael Stipe, and notably Durst. Manson later exclaimed: &quot;With this video, we didn&#x27;t wanna seem bitching like about somehow that Limp Bizkit&#x27;s doing better than we are, in their mind.&quot; Reznor later exclaimed; &quot;I don&#x27;t have to say Limp Bizkit sucks, you know it, I know it, I shouldn&#x27;t have to say it&quot;.

Durst responded to Manson and Reznor&#x27;s insults: &quot;I understand that Marilyn Manson is very unhappy that his career has gone in a shambles and he&#x27;s alienated his fans so if he has to say things like that because he&#x27;s very mad at himself, I would forgive him. And Trent Reznor&#x27;s in the fucking same boat. Trent Reznor is obviously unhappy with how he&#x27;s alienated the world, how long he took to make a record, and how he thought he was immortal. We&#x27;re just here doing what we do and we have nothing to say about anybody. I wish them both luck and I feel sorry that they&#x27;re so jealous and mad at themselves that they have to talk shit.&quot;

Durst&#x27;s relationship with Manson had reportedly grown cordial as the two appeared on the cover of a Rolling Stone magazine issue in June 2003 alongside James Hetfield and Ozzy Osbourne.

Despite this, Limp Bizkit guitarist Wes Borland would join Manson&#x27;s touring band in 2008. During a show in Seoul, South Korea on August 15, 2008; Manson would introduce Borland onstage and attacked Limp Bizkit, claiming to the crowd &quot;Here&#x27;s our new guitarist, he used to play for a really bad band…&quot;. Borland would depart Manson&#x27;s touring band after less than nine months.

=== Puddle of Mudd ===
Due to the notoriety surrounding Puddle of Mudd receiving a record deal through Durst in 2000, the band was often asked in regards to their relationship with him. Wes Scantlin criticized Durst in an interview in 2004 with Canada&#x27;s &quot;Chart&quot; magazine: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t write our songs, he doesn&#x27;t produce our songs, he doesn&#x27;t do anything for us. He doesn&#x27;t do our videos anymore. He doesn&#x27;t do anything for this band. I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s doing, I don&#x27;t know what the guy&#x27;s like. All I know is that he&#x27;s like Mr Hollywood guy, Mr Celebrity. Like, &#x27;I don&#x27;t hang out with anybody except Hollywood celebrities&#x27;. Every single fucking interview I&#x27;ve ever fucking done, I get asked about that fucking guy... And for me to do interviews all the time and be asked about this certain individual... People think he writes music with me or something. He does not do that. I just don&#x27;t get it. We have nothing in common. He doesn&#x27;t even call us, he has his assistant call us to congratulate us on our record. Yeah, that&#x27;s how pathetic he is.&quot;

On April 22, 2008, in an interview with Artisan News Service, Wes Scantlin retracted his previous criticism of Fred Durst: &quot;Fred got our foot in the door and helped us out tremendously. I think nowadays he&#x27;s doing a lot of directing and we don&#x27;t really speak to him too much but we appreciate everything he&#x27;s ever done for our careers.&quot;

<doc id="182027" wikidata="Q6978347" url="?curid=182027" title="National Security Entry-Exit Registration System">
<text>The National Security Entry-Exit Registration System(NSEERS) or INS Special Registration was a system for registering certain non-citizens within the United States, initiated in September 2002 as part of the War on Terrorism. Portions were suspended as of April 27, 2011, and the entirety of the regulation was removed on December 23, 2016.

This system had two separate components: port-of-entry registration and domestic registration. In each case, those who registered were fingerprinted, photographed, and interviewed. They were required to provide detailed information about their plans and to update Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) if their plans changed. They were only permitted to enter and depart the U.S. through designated ports of entry. On December 22, 2016 the Obama administration announced that it would dismantle the NSEERS regulatory framework, which would essentially cancel the program.

== History ==
The Bush administration started the program in September 2002. A goal of the program was to increase screening of travelers from specific countries. Because a majority of these countries were predominantly Muslim cultures, the American Civil Liberties Union said the program unjustly targeted individuals based on religion.

In January 2003 a Justice Department spokesperson said NSEERS helped law enforcement authorities apprehend 330 &quot;known criminals&quot; and three &quot;known terrorists&quot;; The spokesperson made these remarks in order to advocate for renewed funding for the program, for which the Bush administration was requesting $16.8 million per fiscal year. However, by 1 December 2016, &quot;[n]o known terrorism convictions resulted from the program,&quot; according to a letter from some Democratic Members of Congress and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. By January 2003, at least 138,000 individuals were registered in NSEERS, according to testimony by the Department of Homeland Security to Congress. As of May 2003, 82,581 individuals had complied with the domestic portion of the program. Of these, at least 13,153 were placed in deportation proceedings. Although the program originally included a requirement to re-register annually, the Department of Homeland Security, which gained jurisdiction over the program, eliminated this requirement.

Immigrant rights advocates such as Rabia Chaudry criticized the program, particularly the domestic portion of it, for profiling on the basis of ethnicity and religion as well as generally undermining immigrants&#x27; rights. They noted that 24 of the 25 countries included on the list are predominantly Muslim, while all of the countries are in Asia or Africa. The ACLU said that the program was ineffective due to it producing no terrorism-related convictions in the 93,000 cases it created. Given the large numbers involved and the nature of the requirements, they argued, it was unlikely to find any members of Al Qaeda. NSEERS was probed in the documentary film &quot;Aliens Among Us&quot;, by Martina Radwan, for the effect it had on immigrant families of Arab origin.

=== Suspension ===
The system was discontinued in 2011 under the Obama administration, whereupon the Department of Homeland Security said that the registration system had become outdated in the wake of new technology.

NSEERS was indefinitely suspended as of April 27, 2011, when the US-VISIT program was instituted as its replacement. The Department of Homeland Security website said, &quot;Because the Secretary of Homeland Security&#x27;s authority under the NSEERS regulations is broader than the manual information flow based on country designation that has now ended, the underlying NSEERS regulation will remain in place in the event a special registration program is again needed.&quot;

=== Removal ===
On November 22, 2016, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee submitted a letter co-signed by nearly 200 organizations to President Barack Obama, calling on his administration to rescind the regulatory framework behind the NSEERS. The letter was submitted on behalf of nearly 200 civil and human rights, civil liberties, education, social justice, and inter-faith organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil Human Rights, American Immigration Council, Center for American Progress, National Council of La Raza, the National Immigration Forum, and the Southern Poverty Law Center. The letter reads in part, &quot;As organizations that represent diverse communities and that are committed to civil and immigrant rights, we firmly believe that removal of the NSEERS framework is a necessary imperative. We ask the Administration to immediately take steps to remove the regulatory structure of NSEERS and stop any future use of the program.&quot;

The registration system was ordered to be removed near the end of the President Obama&#x27;s second term in 2016. The removal order occurred after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman wrote, &quot;We can&#x27;t risk giving President-elect Trump the tools to create an unconstitutional religious registry.&quot; However, because the order occurred within the last 60 days of a President&#x27;s term, if it is a &quot;major regulation&quot; (major social policy significance or cost of more than $100 million), it is subject to Congressional review (see Midnight regulations) and may be voided by Congress under the Congressional Review Act. Trump&#x27;s advisers had suggested keeping the system to track immigrants. The Obama administration&#x27;s order to remove the system said the program was redundant because it called for manual collection of data that is now captured automatically.

== Registration ==
Port-of-entry registration was required for nationals of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and Syria (including those that were born in these countries but have a passport from a different country), in addition to any other non-citizen, non-permanent residents determined in advance by the United States Department of State or the INS, or as they enter the country by INS inspectors. According to the September 2002 notice signed by Attorney General John Ashcroft announcing the update to special registration in the Federal Register, some form of special registration was already in effect for the above countries as early as 1998. The new system began on September 11, 2002.

Certain non-citizens who were in the United States on or prior to September 10, 2002, were required to register in person at an INS office. This procedure was required of males over the age of sixteen who entered the United States legally on particular types of visa (primarily student, work, and tourist) from certain countries. Countries were named on four occasions:

*Group 1: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan or Syria
*Group 2: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Eritrea, Lebanon, Morocco, North Korea, Oman, Qatar, Somalia, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen
*Group 3: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
*Group 4: Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Kuwait

The deadlines for registration were December 16, 2002 (Group 1), January 10, 2003 (Group 2), February 21, 2003 (Group 3), and March 28, 2003 (Group 4). The deadlines for Group 1 and 2 registration were later extended to February 7, 2003. The deadlines for Groups 3 and 4 were extended to March 21, 2003 and April 25, 2003.
