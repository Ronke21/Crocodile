<doc id="180785" wikidata="Q531328" url="?curid=180785" title="Ring (film)">
<text>is a 1998 Japanese supernatural psychological horror film directed by Hideo Nakata and written by Hiroshi Takahashi, based on the 1991 novel by Koji Suzuki. The film stars Nanako Matsushima, Miki Nakatani, and Hiroyuki Sanada, and follows a reporter who is racing to investigate the mystery behind a cursed video tape; whoever watches the tape dies seven days after doing so. The film is also titled The Ring (stylized as the Ring) in Japan and was released in North America as Ringu.

Production took approximately nine months, and the film was shot back-to-back with a sequel, &quot;Spiral&quot;, featuring much of the same cast but involving neither Nakata or Takahashi; both films were released together in Japan on January 31, 1998, with the studio hoping for the popularity of the novel to make both films successful. After its release, &quot;Ring&quot; was a box office hit in Japan and internationally and was acclaimed by critics, who praised its atmosphere, slow-paced horror and themes.

Spawning a popular franchise, the film has been deemed very influential, triggering both a western popularization of Japanese horror, including with its own English-language adaptations starting with 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Ring&quot;, and a renaissance of Japanese horror films, inspiring other successful franchises such as &quot;Ju-On&quot; and &quot;The Grudge&quot; and spearheading Hollywood&#x27;s horror films&#x27; transition from slashers into more atmospheric films in the 2000s. Despite the success of the original film, &quot;Spiral&quot; was largely ignored upon release, leading to Nakata and Takahashi making &quot;Ring 2&quot; (1999), another sequel ignoring the events of &quot;Spiral&quot;.

==Plot==
During a sleepover, high schoolers Tomoko and Masami discuss an urban legend about a video tape that curses its viewers to die in seven days after a foreboding phone call. Tomoko then confesses that last week, she and her friends watched a strange videotape and received an inexplicable phone call afterwards. They receive a false alarm phone call, then Masami goes to the toilet. Tomoko witnesses the TV turn on by itself and is killed by an unseen presence or figure.

Reiko Asakawa, Tomoko&#x27;s aunt and a journalist investigating this urban legend, attends her funeral and learns that three of Tomoko&#x27;s friends, who watched the tape with her, all died at the same time and (presumably) the same way she did. Reiko finds an unmarked video tape in the resort cabin where the four stayed. It contains brief, seemingly unrelated scenes accompanied by screeching sounds, and ends with a shot of an eerie scene of a water well. After watching, Reiko sees an apparition and receives a phone call emitting the screeching sounds from the tape. Convinced she has been cursed, Reiko takes the tape and leaves the cabin.

Reiko enlists the help of her psychic ex-husband Ryūji Takayama. Examining a copy of the tape that Reiko made, the pair find a cryptic message spoken in an Ōshima dialect and prepare to go to Ōshima. Before departing, Reiko catches Yōichi, her son with Ryūji, watching the tape after being peer pressured by &quot;Tomoko.&quot;

In Ōshima, Reiko and Ryūji learn about Shizuko Yamamura, the woman in the tape. Before her suicide, Shizuko gained notoriety following a public demonstration of her psychic ability organized by ESP researcher Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, with whom she had an affair. When confronting Shizuko&#x27;s cousin Takashi, the pair learn through a vision that during the demonstration, Shizuko&#x27;s young daughter Sadako, whose name is hinted in the tape, psychically killed a journalist who decried Shizuko&#x27;s abilities. After failing to track down Sadako, Reiko realizes that Ryūji never received a phone call after watching the tape as she did at the cabin in Izu. They rush back to the cabin.

Reiko and Ryūji find a sealed well in the cabin&#x27;s crawlspace. Through another vision, they learn that Dr. Ikuma trapped Sadako inside the well. They conclude that Sadako remained alive and that the curse was born when a videotape &quot;recorded&quot; the rage she had projected. When draining the water, they find Sadako&#x27;s remains. Reiko&#x27;s seven-day deadline passes, and she remains alive, leading them to believe the curse is broken.

The next day, Ryūji&#x27;s TV turns on by itself, showing the well at the end of the tape. Sadako&#x27;s vengeful spirit staggers from the well and out of the TV, advancing toward Ryūji and killing him. Reiko, who has been trying to call Ryūji, hears his last moments over the phone. Guided by an apparition, Reiko realizes that she unwittingly found the actual way to survive the curse: copying the tape and showing it to someone else within seven days. Desperate to save Yōichi, Reiko drives to her father&#x27;s home to show him the tape.

==Themes and interpretations==
Critics have discussed &quot;Ring&quot;″s preoccupations with Japanese tradition&#x27;s collision with modernity. Colette Balmain identifies: &quot;In the figure of Sadako, &quot;Ring&quot; [utilises the] vengeful yūrei archetype of conventional Japanese horror&quot;. She argues how this traditional Japanese figure is expressed via a video tape which &quot;embodies contemporary anxieties, in that it is technology through which the repressed past reasserts itself&quot;.

Ruth Goldberg argues that &quot;Ring&quot; expresses &quot;ambivalence about motherhood&quot;. She reads Reiko as a mother who – due to the new potential for women&#x27;s independence – neglects her &quot;natural&quot; role as martyred homemaker in pursuit of an independent identity, subsequently neglecting her child. Goldberg identifies a doubling effect whereby the unconscious conflicts of Reiko&#x27;s family are expressed via the supernatural in the other family under Reiko&#x27;s investigation.

Jay McRoy reads the ending hopefully: if the characters therapeutically understand their conflicts, they can live on. Balmain, however, is not optimistic; she reads the replication of the video as technology spreading, virus-like, throughout Japan.

===Title===
The film&#x27;s title, &quot;Ring&quot;, can be interpreted in several ways, such as alluding to the never ending cyclical nature of the ring curse/virus. Another interpretation is that &quot;ring&quot; relates to the phone call which warns those that view the video tape that they will die in seven days, as well as to the view of the ring of light seen from the bottom of the well where Sadako&#x27;s body was left to decompose or the faint ethereal ring of light is said that people see in the afterlife possibly a metaphor of the well.

==Production==

After the moderate success of the 1991 novel &quot;Ring&quot; by Koji Suzuki, Kadokawa Shoten decided to adapt it into a motion picture.

Screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi and director Hideo Nakata collaborated to work on the script after reading Suzuki&#x27;s novel and watching Fuji Television&#x27;s 1995 made-for-TV film, directed by Chisui Takigawa. The broadcast version of the 1995 film was re-edited and released on home video under a new title, &quot;Ring: Kanzenban&quot; ( &quot;Ring: The Complete Edition&quot;; Nakata did not state which version of it he and Takahashi watched.

In their film script, Takashi and Nakata changed the protagonist&#x27;s gender (from male to female), name (from Kazuyuki Asakawa to Reiko Asakawa), marital status (from married to divorced) and child&#x27;s gender and name (from daughter Yoko to son Yoichi).

With the budget of US$1.5 million, the entire production took nine months and one week. According to director Nakata, the script and pre-production process took three or four months, shooting five weeks and post-production four months.

The special effects on the cursed video tape and some parts in the film were shot on a 35 mm film which was passed on to a laboratory in which a computer added a &quot;grainy&quot; effect. Extended visual effects were used in the scene in which the ghost of Sadako Yamamura climbs out of the television. First, they shot the kabuki actress Rie Inō walking backwards in a jerky, exaggerated motion. They then played the film in reverse to portray an unnatural-looking walk for Sadako now known in pop culture as &quot;the creepy japanese ghost girl walk&quot; as described by one of the editors friends.

Both Arrow&#x27;s single Blu-ray Disc and Blu-ray box set were later released in the United States and Canada on October 29, again under the transliterated title &quot;Ringu&quot;.

==Reception==

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 98% based on 43 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.5 out of 10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Ringu&quot; combines supernatural elements with anxieties about modern technology in a truly frightening and unnerving way&quot;.

&quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critic Mark Kermode praised the film&#x27;s &quot;timeless terror&quot;, with its &quot;combination of old folk devils and contemporary moral panics&quot; which appeal to both teen and adult audiences alike. While Adam Smith of &quot;Empire&quot; Online finds the film &quot;throttled by its over complexity, duff plotting and a distinct lack of actual action&quot;, Kermode emphasizes that &quot;one is inclined to conclude that it is the telling, rather than the content of the tale, that is all-important&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; agrees that the slow pace, with &quot;its gradual evocation of evil lying await beneath the surface of normality&quot;, is one of the film&#x27;s biggest strengths. &quot;Ring&quot; was listed as the twelfth best horror film of all time by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and also picked by Stuart Heritage in the same paper as the film that frightened him most.

&quot;Ring&quot; was ranked No. 69 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. In the early 2010s, &quot;Time Out&quot; conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. &quot;Ring&quot; placed at number 61 on their top 100 list.

==Influence==
The international success of the Japanese films launched a revival of horror film making in Japan that resulted in such pictures as Kiyoshi Kurosawa&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Pulse&quot; (known as in Japan), Takashi Shimizu&#x27;s (2000), Hideo Nakata&#x27;s , also based on a short story by Suzuki), and Higuchinsky&#x27;s &quot;Uzumaki&quot; (2000, a.k.a. &quot;Vortex&quot;, based on the Junji Ito horror manga of the same name who also takes a spin of the lucky symbol of spirals into a beautiful yet terrifying twist of horror leaving readers both hooked at the edge of their seat, and wanting to put bleach in their eyes).

===Influence on Western cinema===
&quot;Ring&quot; had some influence on Western cinema and gained cult status in the West.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Hollywood horror had largely been dominated by the slasher sub-genre, which relied on on-screen violence, shock tactics, and gore. &quot;Ring&quot;, whose release in Japan roughly coincided with &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; in the United States, helped to revitalize the genre by taking a more restrained approach to horror, leaving much of the terror to the audience&#x27;s imagination. The film initiated global interest in Japanese cinema in general and Japanese horror cinema in particular, a renaissance which led to the coining of the term &quot;J-Horror&quot; in the West. This &quot;New Asian Horror&quot; resulted in further successful releases, such as &quot;Ju-on: The Grudge&quot; and &quot;Dark Water&quot;. In addition to Japanese productions this boom also managed to bring attention to similar films made in East Asia at the same time such as &quot;A Tale of Two Sisters&quot; from South Korea and &quot;The Eye&quot; from Hong Kong.

All of these films were later remade in English. Released in 2002, &quot;The Ring&quot; reached number 1 at the box office and grossed slightly more in Japan than the original. The original &quot;Ring&quot; grossed in 1998, while &quot;The Ring&quot; remake grossed in 2002.

==Sequels and remakes==

The original sequel was &quot;Spiral&quot;, released in 1998, but due to its poor reception, a new sequel, &quot;Ring 2&quot;, was released in 1999 which continued the story line of this film. It was followed by a 2000 prequel, &quot;Ring 0: Birthday&quot;, followed by &quot;Sadako&quot; in 2019. &quot;Spiral&quot; in turn was followed by &quot;Sadako 3D&quot; in 2012 and &quot;Sadako 3D 2&quot; in 2013. Another installment, &quot;Sadako DX&quot;, was released in 2022.

A television series, &quot;&quot;, was made, with a similar storyline but many changes in characters and their backstories. A South Korean remake &quot;The Ring Virus&quot; was made in 1999, as well as an American remake, &quot;The Ring&quot;, in 2002 as previously mentioned.

<text>Hermeticism, or Hermetism, is a philosophical and religious tradition rooted in the teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a syncretic figure combining elements of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. This system encompasses a wide range of esoteric knowledge, including aspects of alchemy, astrology, and theurgy, and has significantly influenced various mystical and occult traditions throughout history. The writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, often referred to as the &quot;Hermetica&quot;, were produced over a period spanning many centuries () and may be very different in content and scope.

One particular form of Hermetic teaching is the religio-philosophical system found in a specific subgroup of Hermetic writings known as the &#x27;religio-philosophical&#x27; &quot;Hermetica&quot;. The most famous of these are the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;, a collection of seventeen Greek treatises written between approximately 100 and 300 CE, and the &quot;Asclepius&quot;, a treatise from the same period, mainly surviving in a Latin translation. This specific historical form of Hermetic philosophy is sometimes more narrowly referred to as Hermetism, to distinguish it from other philosophies inspired by Hermetic writings of different periods and natures.

The broader term, Hermeticism, may refer to a wide variety of philosophical systems drawing on Hermetic writings or other subject matter associated with Hermes. Notably, alchemy often went by the name of &quot;the Hermetic art&quot; or &quot;the Hermetic philosophy&quot;. The most famous use of the term in this broader sense is in the concept of Renaissance Hermeticism, which refers to the early modern philosophies inspired by the translations of the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; by Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) and Lodovico Lazzarelli (1447–1500), as well as by Paracelsus&#x27; (1494–1541) introduction of a new medical philosophy drawing upon the &#x27;technical&#x27; &quot;Hermetica&quot;, such as the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;.

Throughout its history, Hermeticism was closely associated with the idea of a primeval, divine wisdom revealed only to the most ancient of sages, such as Hermes Trismegistus. During the Renaissance, this evolved into the concept of &quot;prisca theologia &quot;or &quot;ancient theology&quot;, which asserted that a single, true theology was given by God to the earliest humans and that traces of it could still be found in various ancient systems of thought. This idea, popular among Renaissance thinkers like Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), eventually developed into the notion that divine truth could be found across different religious and philosophical traditions, a concept that came to be known as the perennial philosophy. In this context, the term &#x27;Hermetic&#x27; gradually lost its specificity, eventually becoming synonymous with the divine knowledge of the ancient Egyptians, particularly as related to alchemy and magic, a view that was later popularized by nineteenth- and twentieth-century occultists.

==Origins and early development==

===Late Antiquity===

In Late Antiquity, Hermetism originated in the cultural and religious melting pot of Hellenistic Egypt, a period marked by the fusion of Greek, Egyptian, and other Near Eastern religious and philosophical traditions. The central figure of Hermes Trismegistus, who embodies both the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth, emerged as a symbol of this syncretism. Hermes Trismegistus was revered as a divine sage and is credited with a vast corpus of writings known as the &quot;Hermetica&quot;, which expound on various aspects of theology, cosmology, and spiritual practice.

Hermetism developed alongside other significant religious and philosophical movements such as early Christianity, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, the Chaldean Oracles, and late Orphic and Pythagorean literature. These doctrines were &quot;characterized by a resistance to the dominance of either pure rationality or doctrinal faith.&quot; Plutarch&#x27;s mention of Hermes Trismegistus dates back to the first century CE, indicating the early recognition of this figure in Greek and Roman thought. Other significant figures of the time, such as Tertullian, Iamblichus, and Porphyry, were also familiar with Hermetic writings, which influenced their own philosophical and religious ideas.

The texts now known as the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; are generally dated by modern scholars to the beginning of the second century or earlier. These writings focus on the oneness and goodness of God, the purification of the soul, and the relationship between mind and spirit. Their predominant literary form is the dialogue, where Hermes Trismegistus instructs a perplexed disciple on various teachings of hidden wisdom.

In fifth-century Macedonia, Joannes Stobaeus compiled an extensive &quot;Anthology&quot; of Greek poetical, rhetorical, historical, and philosophical literature. Among the preserved excerpts are significant numbers of discourses and dialogues attributed to Hermes Trismegistus.

===Influence on Early Christianity and Gnosticism===
Hermeticism had a significant impact on early Christian thought, particularly in the development of Christian mysticism and esoteric interpretations of scripture. Some early Church Fathers, such as Lactantius, viewed Hermes Trismegistus as a wise pagan prophet whose teachings were compatible with Christianity. The Hermetic idea of a transcendent, ineffable God who created the cosmos through a process of emanation resonated with early Christian theologians, who sought to reconcile their faith with classical philosophy.

However, Hermeticism’s influence was most pronounced in Gnostic traditions, which shared with Hermeticism an emphasis on esoteric knowledge as the key to salvation. Both movements taught that the soul’s true home was in the divine realm and that the material world was a place of exile, albeit with a more positive view in Hermeticism. The Hermetic tradition of ascension through knowledge and purification paralleled Gnostic teachings about the soul’s journey back to the divine source, linking the two esoteric traditions.

==Core texts==

===The &quot;Hermetica&quot;===

The &quot;Hermetica&quot; is a collection of texts attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, and it forms the foundational literature of the Hermetic tradition. These writings were composed over several centuries, primarily during the Hellenistic, Roman, and early Christian periods, roughly between 200 BCE and 300 CE. The &quot;Hermetica&quot; is traditionally divided into two categories: the philosophical or theological Hermetica, and the technical Hermetica, which covers alchemy, astrology, and other forms of occult science.

The most famous and influential of the philosophical Hermetica is the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;, a collection of seventeen treatises that articulate the core doctrines of Hermeticism. These treatises are primarily dialogues in which Hermes Trismegistus imparts esoteric wisdom to a disciple, exploring themes such as the nature of the divine, the cosmos, the soul, and the path to spiritual enlightenment. Key texts within the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; include &quot;Poimandres&quot;, which presents a vision of the cosmos and the role of humanity within it, and &quot;Asclepius&quot;, which discusses theurgy, magic, and the divine spirit residing in all things.

Another significant text within the Hermetica is the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot;, a concise work that has become central to Western alchemical tradition. Although its exact origins are obscure, the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; encapsulates the Hermetic principle of &quot;as above, so below&quot;, which suggests a correspondence between the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (the individual soul). The &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; has been extensively commented upon and has significantly influenced medieval and Renaissance alchemy.

The technical &quot;Hermetica&quot; includes works focused on astrology, alchemy, and theurgy—practices that were seen as methods to understand and manipulate the divine forces in the world. These texts were highly influential in the development of the Western esoteric tradition, contributing to the knowledge base of medieval alchemists and astrologers, as well as to the broader tradition of occultism.

Other important original Hermetic texts include &quot;Isis the Prophetess to Her Son Horus&quot;, which consists of a long dialogue between Isis and Horus on the fall of man and other matters; the &quot;Definitions of Hermes Trismegistus to Asclepius&quot;; and many fragments, which are chiefly preserved in the anthology of Stobaeus.

===Interpretation and transmission===
The transmission and interpretation of the &quot;Hermetica&quot; played a crucial role in its influence on Western thought. During the Renaissance, these texts were rediscovered and translated into Latin, leading to a revival of interest in Hermetic philosophy. The translations by Marsilio Ficino and Lodovico Lazzarelli were particularly significant, as they introduced Hermetic ideas to Renaissance scholars and contributed to the development of early modern esotericism.

Renaissance thinkers like Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Giordano Bruno saw in Hermeticism a source of ancient wisdom that could be harmonized with Christian teachings and classical philosophy. The Hermetic emphasis on the divine nature of humanity and the potential for spiritual ascent resonated with the Renaissance ideal of human dignity and the pursuit of knowledge.

Throughout history, the &quot;Hermetica&quot; has been subject to various interpretations, ranging from philosophical and mystical readings to more practical applications in alchemy and magic. The esoteric nature of these texts has allowed them to be adapted to different cultural and intellectual contexts, ensuring their enduring influence across centuries.

==Philosophical and theological concepts==

===Cosmology and theology===
====God as &#x27;the All&#x27;====
In the religio-philosophical &quot;Hermetica&quot;, the ultimate reality is called by many names, such as God, Lord, Father, Mind (&quot;Nous&quot;), the Creator, the All, the One, etc. In the Hermetic view, God is both the all (Greek: &quot;to pan&quot;) and the creator of the all: all created things pre-exist in God and God is the nature of the cosmos (being both the substance from which it proceeds and the governing principle which orders it), yet the things themselves and the cosmos were all created by God. Thus, God (&#x27;the All&#x27;) creates itself, and is both transcendent (as the creator of the cosmos) and immanent (as the created cosmos). These ideas are closely related to the cosmo-theological views of the Stoics.

====&quot;Prima materia&quot;====

In Hermeticism, &quot;prima materia&quot; is a key concept in the alchemical tradition, representing the raw, undifferentiated substance from which all things originate. It is often associated with chaos, the formless and potential-filled state that precedes creation. The idea of &quot;prima materia&quot; has roots in Greco-Roman traditions, particularly in Orphic cosmogony, where it is linked to the cosmic egg, and in the biblical concept of &quot;Tehom&quot; from Genesis, reflecting a synthesis of classical and Christian thought during the Renaissance.

In alchemy, &quot;prima materia&quot; is the substance that undergoes transformation through processes such as &quot;nigredo&quot;, the blackening stage associated with chaos, which ultimately leads to the creation of the philosopher&#x27;s stone. This transformation symbolizes the &quot;magnum opus&quot; (&#x27;Great Work&#x27;) of the alchemist, seeking to purify and elevate the material to its perfected state. Renaissance figures like Paracelsus expanded on this concept, connecting it to the elements and the broader Hermetic belief in the unity of matter and spirit.

The significance of &quot;prima materia&quot; in Hermeticism lies in its representation of the potential for both material and spiritual transformation, embodying the Hermetic principle of &quot;as above, so below&quot;, where the macrocosm and microcosm reflect each other in the alchemical process.

===The nature of divinity===
====&quot;Prisca theologia&quot;====
Hermeticists adhere to the doctrine of &quot;prisca theologia&quot;, the belief that a single, true theology exists, which is present in all religions and was revealed by God to humanity in antiquity. Early Christian theologians, including Church Fathers such as Lactantius and Augustine, referenced Hermes Trismegistus, sometimes portraying him as a wise pagan prophet whose teachings could complement Christian doctrine.

During the Renaissance, scholars such as Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola sought to integrate Hermetic teachings into Christian theology, viewing the Hermetic writings as remnants of an ancient wisdom that predated and influenced all religious traditions, including Christianity. It was during this period that the association of Hermes Trismegistus with biblical figures like Moses, or as part of a lineage including Enoch and Noah, was more explicitly developed by these scholars to harmonize Hermetic thought with biblical narratives. This blending of traditions was part of a broader intellectual effort to reconcile pagan and Christian wisdom during this period.

====As above, so below====

&quot;As above, so below&quot; is a popular modern paraphrase of the second verse of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; (a compact and cryptic text attributed to Hermes Trismegistus and first attested in a late eight or early ninth century Arabic source), as it appears in its most widely divulged medieval Latin translation:

====The seven heavens====

In addition to the principles of &quot;prisca theologia&quot; and &quot;as above, so below,&quot; Hermeticism teaches that the soul&#x27;s journey back to the divine involves ascending through the seven heavens. These heavens correspond to the seven classical planets and represent stages of spiritual purification and enlightenment. As the soul transcends each heavenly sphere, it sheds the material influences and attachments associated with that level, progressively aligning itself with the divine order. This process symbolizes the soul&#x27;s return to its divine origin, ultimately seeking unity with The One—the source of all existence. The concept of the seven heavens underscores the Hermetic belief in the potential for spiritual transformation through divine knowledge and practice, guiding the soul toward its ultimate goal of reunification with the divine.

===Creation, the human condition, and spiritual ascent===
====Cosmogony and the fall of man====

A creation story is told by God to Hermes in the first book of the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;. It begins when God, by an act of will, creates the primary matter that is to constitute the cosmos. From primary matter God separates the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water). &quot;The Word (Logos)&quot; then leaps forth from the materializing four elements, which were unintelligent. Nous then makes the seven heavens spin, and from them spring forth creatures without speech. Earth is then separated from water, and animals (other than man) are brought forth. Then God orders the elements into the seven heavens (often held to be the spheres of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the Sun, and the Moon, which travel in circles and govern destiny). The God then created androgynous man, in God&#x27;s own image, and handed over his creation.

Man carefully observed the creation of nous and received from God man&#x27;s authority over all creation. Man then rose up above the spheres&#x27; paths to better view creation. He then showed the form of the All to Nature. Nature fell in love with the All, and man, seeing his reflection in water, fell in love with Nature and wished to dwell in it. Immediately, man became one with Nature and became a slave to its limitations, such as sex and sleep. In this way, man became speechless (having lost &quot;the Word&quot;) and he became &quot;double&quot;, being mortal in body yet immortal in spirit, and having authority over all creation yet subject to destiny.

The alternative account of the fall of man, as preserved in &quot;Isis the Prophetess to Her Son Horus&quot;, describes a process in which God, after creating the universe and various deities, fashioned human souls from a mysterious substance and assigned them to dwell in the astral region. These souls were then tasked with creating life on Earth. However, the souls became prideful and sought equality with the highest gods, which displeased God. As a consequence, God instructed Hermes to create physical bodies to imprison the souls as a form of punishment. The souls were told that their time on Earth would be marked by suffering, but if they lived worthily of their divine origin, they would eventually return to the heavenly realm. If not, they would face repeated reincarnation on Earth.

====Good and evil====
Hermes explains in Book 9 of the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; that nous (reason and knowledge) brings forth either good or evil, depending upon whether one receives one&#x27;s perceptions from God or from demons. God brings forth good, but demons bring forth evil. Among the evils brought forth by demons are: &quot;adultery, murder, violence to one&#x27;s father, sacrilege, ungodliness, strangling, suicide from a cliff and all such other demonic actions&quot;.

The word &quot;good&quot; is used very strictly. It is restricted to references to God. It is only God (in the sense of the nous, not in the sense of the All) who is completely free of evil. Men are prevented from being good because man, having a body, is consumed by his physical nature, and is ignorant of the Supreme Good. &quot;Asclepius&quot; explains that evil is born from desire which itself is caused by ignorance, the intelligence bestowed by God is what allows some to rid themselves of desire.

A focus upon the material life is said to be the only thing that offends God:
One must create, one must do something positive in one&#x27;s life, because God is a generative power. Not creating anything leaves a person &quot;sterile&quot; (i.e., unable to accomplish anything).

====Reincarnation and rebirth====

Reincarnation is mentioned in Hermetic texts. Hermes Trismegistus asked:

Rebirth appears central to the practice of hermetic philosophy. The process would begin with a candidate separating themselves from the world before they rid themselves of material vices; they are then reborn as someone completely different from who they were before.

==Historical development==
===Middle Ages===
A few primarily Hermetic occult orders were founded in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance. In England, it grew interwoven with the Lollard-Familist traditions.

====Etymology====
The term &#x27;Hermetic&#x27; derives from &quot;hermeticus&quot;, a Latin adjective that first emerged in the medieval period, derived from the name of the Greek god Hermes, to describe the esoteric writings and practices associated with Hermes Trismegistus. This term became widely used in reference to the &quot;Hermetica&quot;, a body of texts considered to contain secret wisdom on the nature of the divine, the cosmos, and the human soul.

In English, the word &#x27;Hermetic&#x27; appeared in the 17th century. One of the earliest instances in English literature is found in John Everard&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Pymander of Hermes&quot;, published in 1650. The term was used in reference to &quot;Hermetic writers&quot; such as Robert Fludd. The synonymous term &#x27;Hermetical&#x27; is found in Sir Thomas Browne’s &quot;Religio Medici&quot; (1643), where &quot;Hermetical Philosophers&quot; are mentioned, referring to scholars and alchemists who engaged in the study of the natural world through the lens of Hermetic wisdom.

The phrase &quot;hermetically sealed&quot; originates from alchemical practices and refers to an airtight sealing method used in laboratories. This term became a metaphor for the safeguarding of esoteric knowledge, representing the idea that such wisdom should be kept hidden from the uninitiated.

Over time, the word &#x27;Hermetic&#x27; evolved to encompass a broader range of meanings, often signifying something mysterious, occult, or impenetrable. This evolution reflects the central theme of secrecy within the Hermetic tradition, which emphasizes the importance of protecting sacred knowledge from those who are not prepared to receive it.

===Renaissance revival===

The Western esoteric tradition has been greatly influenced by Hermeticism. After centuries of falling out of favor, Hermeticism was reintroduced to the West when, in 1460, a man named Leonardo di Pistoia brought the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; to Pistoia. He was one of many agents sent out by Pistoia&#x27;s ruler, Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, to scour European monasteries for lost ancient writings. The work of such writers as Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, who attempted to reconcile Jewish kabbalah and Christian mysticism, brought Hermeticism into a context more easily understood by Europeans during the time of the Renaissance.

In 1614, Isaac Casaubon, a Swiss philologist, analyzed the Greek Hermetic texts for linguistic style. He concluded that the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus were not the work of an ancient Egyptian priest but in fact dated to the second and third centuries CE.

Even in light of Casaubon&#x27;s linguistic discovery (and typical of many adherents of Hermetic philosophy in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries), Thomas Browne in his &quot;Religio Medici&quot; (1643) confidently stated: &quot;The severe schools shall never laugh me out of the philosophy of Hermes, that this visible world is but a portrait of the invisible.&quot;

In 1678, flaws in Casaubon&#x27;s dating were discerned by Ralph Cudworth, who argued that Casaubon&#x27;s allegation of forgery could only be applied to three of the seventeen treatises contained within the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot;. Moreover, Cudworth noted Casaubon&#x27;s failure to acknowledge the codification of these treatises as a late formulation of a pre-existing oral tradition. According to Cudworth, the texts must be viewed as a terminus ad quem and not a terminus a quo. Lost Greek texts, and many of the surviving vulgate books, contained discussions of alchemy clothed in philosophical metaphor.

In 1964, Frances A. Yates advanced the thesis that Renaissance Hermeticism, or what she called &quot;the Hermetic tradition&quot;, had been a crucial factor in the development of modern science. While Yates&#x27;s thesis has since been largely rejected, the important role played by the &#x27;Hermetic&#x27; science of alchemy in the thought of such figures as Jan Baptist van Helmont (1580–1644), Robert Boyle (1627–1691) or Isaac Newton (1642–1727) has been amply demonstrated.

===Modern period===
Rosicrucianism is a movement which incorporates the Hermetic philosophy. It dates back to the 17th century. The sources dating the existence of the Rosicrucians to the 17th century are three German pamphlets: the &quot;Fama&quot;, the &quot;Confessio Fraternitatis&quot;, and &quot;The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot;. Some scholars believe these to be hoaxes of the time and say that later Rosicrucian organizations are the first actual appearance of a Rosicrucian society.

Hermetic magic underwent a 19th-century revival in Western Europe, where it was practiced by groups such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. It was also practiced by individual persons, such as Eliphas Lévi, William Butler Yeats, Arthur Machen, and Frederick Hockley. The &quot;Kybalion&quot; is a book anonymously published in 1908 by three people who called themselves the &quot;Three Initiates&quot;, and which expounds upon essential Hermetic principles.

In 1924, Walter Scott placed the date of the Hermetic texts shortly after 200 CE, but W. Flinders Petrie placed their origin between 200 and 500 BCE.

In 1945, Hermetic texts were found near the Egyptian town Nag Hammadi. One of these texts had the form of a conversation between Hermes and Asclepius. A second text (titled &quot;On the Ogdoad and Ennead&quot;) told of the Hermetic mystery schools. It was written in the Coptic language, the latest and final form in which the Egyptian language was written.

Gilles Quispel says &quot;It is now completely certain that there existed before and after the beginning of the Christian era in Alexandria a secret society, akin to a Masonic lodge. The members of this group called themselves &#x27;brethren,&#x27; were initiated through a baptism of the Spirit, greeted each other with a sacred kiss, celebrated a sacred meal and read the Hermetic writings as edifying treatises for their spiritual progress.&quot; On the other hand, Christian Bull argues that &quot;there is no reason to identify [Alexandria] as the birthplace of a Hermetic lodge as several scholars have done. There is neither internal nor external evidence for such an Alexandrian lodge, a designation that is alien to the ancient world and carries Masonic connotations.&quot;

According to Geza Vermes, Hermeticism was a Hellenistic mysticism contemporaneous with the Fourth Gospel, and Hermes Tresmegistos was &quot;the Hellenized reincarnation of the Egyptian deity Thoth, the source of wisdom, who was believed to deify man through knowledge (&quot;gnosis&quot;).&quot;

====Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn====

The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was a specifically Hermetic society that taught alchemy, qabalah, and the magic of Hermes, along with the principles of occult science. The Order was open to both sexes and treated them as equals. 

Arthur Edward Waite, a member and later the head of the Golden Dawn, wrote &quot;The Hermetic Museum&quot; and &quot;The Hermetic Museum Restored and Enlarged&quot;. He edited &quot;The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus&quot;, which was published as a two-volume set. He considered himself to be a Hermeticist and was instrumental in adding the word &quot;Hermetic&quot; to the official title of the Golden Dawn.

The Golden Dawn maintained the tightest of secrecy, which was enforced by severe penalties for those who disclosed its secrets. Overall, the general public was left oblivious of the actions, and even of the existence, of the Order, so few if any secrets were disclosed.

Its secrecy was broken first by Aleister Crowley in 1905 and later by Israel Regardie in 1937. Regardie gave a detailed account of the Order&#x27;s teachings to the general public.

====Scholarship on the &quot;Hermetica&quot;====

After the Renaissance and even within the 20th century, scholars did not study Hermeticism nearly as much as other topics; however, the 1990s saw a renewed interest in Hermetic scholarly works and discussion.

==Hermetic practices==
&quot;The three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe&quot; is a phrase derived from the Emerald Tablet referring to three disciplines of Hermeticism. Hermetic practices are diverse and deeply rooted in the esoteric traditions of alchemy, astrology, theurgy, and other occult disciplines. These practices are not merely ritualistic but are aimed at achieving spiritual transformation, aligning the practitioner with the divine order, and unlocking hidden knowledge about the self and the cosmos.

===Alchemy===
Alchemy, or the operation of the Sun, is perhaps the most well-known of the Hermetic practices, often misunderstood as merely a proto-scientific attempt to turn base metals into gold. In Hermeticism, however, alchemy is primarily a spiritual discipline, where the physical transformation of materials is a metaphor for the spiritual purification and perfection of the soul. The ultimate goal of alchemical work is the creation of the philosopher&#x27;s stone, which symbolizes the attainment of spiritual enlightenment and immortality. Alchemy is not merely the changing of lead into gold, which is called chrysopoeia. It is an investigation into the spiritual constitution, or life, of matter and material existence through an application of the mysteries of birth, death, and resurrection. 

The alchemical process is divided into stages, such as &quot;nigredo&quot; (blackening), &quot;albedo&quot; (whitening), and &quot;rubedo&quot; (reddening), each representing different phases of spiritual purification and enlightenment. &quot;Prima materia&quot;, or the original chaotic substance from which all things are formed, is central to alchemy. The various stages of chemical distillation and fermentation, among other processes, are aspects of these mysteries that, when applied, quicken nature&#x27;s processes to bring a natural body to perfection. By transmuting prima materia into the philosopher&#x27;s stone, the alchemist seeks to achieve unity with the divine and realize their true nature as a divine being. This perfection is the accomplishment of the Great Work ().

===Astrology===

Astrology in Hermeticism is not merely the study of celestial bodies&#x27; influence on human affairs but a means of understanding the divine order of the cosmos. The positions and movements of the planets and stars are seen as reflections of divine will and the structure of the universe, holding metaphorical value as symbols in the mind of the All. Hermetic astrology seeks to decode these celestial messages to align the practitioner’s life with the divine plan. It also plays a role in determining the timing of rituals and alchemical operations, as certain astrological conditions are believed to be more conducive to spiritual work. The discovery of astrology is attributed to Zoroaster, who is said to have discovered this part of the wisdom of the whole universe and taught it to man.

===Theurgy===

Theurgy is a practice focused on invoking the presence of gods or divine powers to purify the soul and facilitate its ascent through the heavenly spheres. Unlike purely magical operations aimed at influencing the physical world, theurgical practices are intended to bring the practitioner into direct contact with the divine. By engaging in theurgy, the Hermetic practitioner seeks to align their soul with higher spiritual realities, ultimately leading to union with The One. This practice often involves the assumption of godforms or the use of sacred names and symbols to draw down divine energy. In forms of Hermeticism influenced by Christian Kabbalah, this divine magic is reliant upon a hierarchy of angels, archangels, and the names of God.

&quot;Theurgy&quot; translates to the &quot;science or art of divine works&quot; and is the practical aspect of the Hermetic art of alchemy. Furthermore, alchemy is seen as the &quot;key&quot; to theurgy, the ultimate goal of which is to become united with higher counterparts, leading to the attainment of divine consciousness.

===Hermetic Qabalah===

Hermetic Qabalah is an adaptation and expansion of Jewish Kabbalistic thought within the context of Western esotericism. It plays a significant role in Hermetic practices by providing a framework for understanding the relationship between the divine, the cosmos, and the self. The central symbol in Hermetic Qabalah is the Tree of Life, which represents the structure of creation and the path of spiritual ascent. Each of the ten spheres (sephiroth) on the Tree corresponds to different aspects of divinity and stages of spiritual development.

Hermetic Qabalah integrates alchemical, astrological, and theurgical elements, allowing practitioners to work with these disciplines in a unified system. Through the study and application of Qabalistic principles, Hermetic practitioners seek to achieve self-knowledge, spiritual enlightenment, and ultimately, unity with the divine.

==Hermeticism and other religions==
Hermeticism has influenced and been influenced by major religious traditions, particularly Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. During the Renaissance, Christian scholars like Marsilio Ficino integrated Hermetic teachings into Christian theology, viewing them as ancient wisdom compatible with Christian doctrine. This led to the development of a Christianized Hermeticism that saw Hermes Trismegistus as a figure of proto-Christian knowledge.

In Judaism, Hermetic ideas merged with Kabbalistic thought, leading to the development of Hermetic Qabalah. This syncretic system combined Hermetic principles with Jewish mysticism, significantly influencing Western esotericism.

Islamic mysticism, particularly Sufism, and Islamic alchemy were also influenced by Hermeticism. Islamic scholars preserved and transmitted Hermetic texts, integrating them into Islamic philosophy and spiritual practices.

==Criticism and controversies==
Hermeticism, like many esoteric traditions, has faced criticism and sparked controversy over the centuries, particularly in relation to its origins, authenticity, and role in modern spiritual and occult movements.

===Scholarly debates===
The authenticity and historical origins of Hermetic texts have been a major point of debate among scholars. Some researchers argue that the &quot;Corpus Hermeticum&quot; and other Hermetic writings are not the remnants of ancient wisdom but rather syncretic works composed during the Hellenistic period, blending Greek, Egyptian, and other influences. The dating of these texts has been particularly contentious, with some scholars placing their origins in the early centuries CE, while others suggest even earlier roots.

Another scholarly debate revolves around the figure of Hermes Trismegistus himself. While traditionally considered an ancient sage or a syncretic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth, modern scholars often view Hermes Trismegistus as a symbolic representation of a certain type of wisdom rather than a historical figure. This has led to discussions about the extent to which Hermeticism can be considered a coherent tradition versus a loose collection of related ideas and texts.

===Reception and criticism in modern times===
In modern times, Hermeticism has been both embraced and criticized by various spiritual and occult movements. Organizations like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn have drawn heavily on Hermetic principles, integrating them into their rituals and teachings. However, some critics argue that the modern use of Hermeticism often distorts its original meaning, blending it with other esoteric traditions in ways that obscure its true nature.

Furthermore, Hermeticism&#x27;s emphasis on personal spiritual knowledge and its sometimes ambiguous relationship with orthodox religious teachings have led to criticism from more conservative religious groups. These critics often view Hermeticism as a form of occultism that promotes a dangerous or misleading path away from traditional religious values.

==Legacy and influence==
Hermeticism has left a profound legacy on Western thought, influencing a wide range of esoteric traditions, philosophical movements, and cultural expressions. Its impact can be traced from the Renaissance revival of Hermetic texts to modern esotericism and popular culture.

===Influence on Western esotericism===
Hermeticism is one of the cornerstones of Western esotericism, with its ideas deeply embedded in various occult and mystical traditions. The Renaissance saw a revival of Hermeticism, particularly through the works of scholars like Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, who integrated Hermetic teachings into Christian theology and philosophy. This revival laid the groundwork for the development of Western esoteric traditions, including Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.

The Hermetic principle of &quot;as above, so below&quot; and the concept of &quot;prisca theologia&quot;—the idea that all true knowledge and religion stem from a single ancient source—became central tenets in these esoteric movements. Hermeticism&#x27;s emphasis on personal spiritual transformation and the pursuit of esoteric knowledge has continued to resonate with various occult groups, influencing modern spiritual movements such as Thelema, founded by Aleister Crowley, and contemporary practices of alchemy, astrology, and magic.

===Influence on literature and culture===
Beyond its esoteric influence, Hermeticism has also permeated literature, art, and popular culture. The symbolism and themes found in Hermetic texts have inspired numerous writers, artists, and thinkers. For example, the works of William Blake, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Jorge Luis Borges contain elements of Hermetic philosophy, particularly its themes of spiritual ascent, divine knowledge, and the unity of all things.

In modern literature, Hermetic motifs can be seen in the works of authors like Umberto Eco, John Crowley, and Dan Brown, who explore themes of hidden knowledge, secret societies, and the mystical connections between the microcosm and macrocosm. Hermetic symbols, such as the caduceus of Hermes and the philosopher’s stone, have also found their way into popular culture, appearing in films, television shows, and video games as symbols of mystery, power, and transformation.

<text>In algebra, a cubic equation in one variable is an equation of the form
formula_1
in which is not zero.

The solutions of this equation are called roots of the cubic function defined by the left-hand side of the equation. If all of the coefficients , , , and of the cubic equation are real numbers, then it has at least one real root (this is true for all odd-degree polynomial functions). All of the roots of the cubic equation can be found by the following means:

* algebraically: more precisely, they can be expressed by a &quot;cubic formula&quot; involving the four coefficients, the four basic arithmetic operations, square roots, and cube roots. (This is also true of quadratic (second-degree) and quartic (fourth-degree) equations, but not for higher-degree equations, by the Abel–Ruffini theorem.)
* trigonometrically
* numerical approximations of the roots can be found using root-finding algorithms such as Newton&#x27;s method.

The coefficients do not need to be real numbers. Much of what is covered below is valid for coefficients in any field with characteristic other than 2 and 3. The solutions of the cubic equation do not necessarily belong to the same field as the coefficients. For example, some cubic equations with rational coefficients have roots that are irrational (and even non-real) complex numbers.

==History==

Cubic equations were known to the ancient Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, and Egyptians. Babylonian (20th to 16th centuries BC) cuneiform tablets have been found with tables for calculating cubes and cube roots. The Babylonians could have used the tables to solve cubic equations, but no evidence exists to confirm that they did. The problem of doubling the cube involves the simplest and oldest studied cubic equation, and one for which the ancient Egyptians did not believe a solution existed. In the 5th century BC, Hippocrates reduced this problem to that of finding two mean proportionals between one line and another of twice its length, but could not solve this with a compass and straightedge construction, a task which is now known to be impossible. Methods for solving cubic equations appear in &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;, a Chinese mathematical text compiled around the 2nd century BC and commented on by Liu Hui in the 3rd century. 

In the 3rd century AD, the Greek mathematician Diophantus found integer or rational solutions for some bivariate cubic equations (Diophantine equations). Hippocrates, Menaechmus and Archimedes are believed to have come close to solving the problem of doubling the cube using intersecting conic sections, though historians such as Reviel Netz dispute whether the Greeks were thinking about cubic equations or just problems that can lead to cubic equations. Some others like T. L. Heath, who translated all of Archimedes&#x27;s works, disagree, putting forward evidence that Archimedes really solved cubic equations using intersections of two conics, but also discussed the conditions where the roots are 0, 1 or 2. 
In the 7th century, the Tang dynasty astronomer mathematician Wang Xiaotong in his mathematical treatise titled Jigu Suanjing systematically established and solved numerically 25 cubic equations of the form , 23 of them with , and two of them with .

In the 11th century, the Persian poet-mathematician, Omar Khayyam (1048–1131), made significant progress in the theory of cubic equations. In an early paper, he discovered that a cubic equation can have more than one solution and stated that it cannot be solved using compass and straightedge constructions. He also found a geometric solution. In his later work, the &quot;Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra&quot;, he wrote a complete classification of cubic equations with general geometric solutions found by means of intersecting conic sections. Khayyam made an attempt to come up with an algebraic formula for extracting cubic roots. He wrote: “We have tried to express these roots by algebra but have failed. It may be, however, that men who come after us will succeed.”

In the 12th century, the Indian mathematician Bhaskara II attempted the solution of cubic equations without general success. However, he gave one example of a cubic equation: . In the 12th century, another Persian mathematician, Sharaf al-Dīn al-Tūsī (1135–1213), wrote the &quot;Al-Muʿādalāt&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Equations&quot;), which dealt with eight types of cubic equations with positive solutions and five types of cubic equations which may not have positive solutions. He used what would later be known as the &quot;Horner–Ruffini method&quot; to numerically approximate the root of a cubic equation. He also used the concepts of maxima and minima of curves in order to solve cubic equations which may not have positive solutions. He understood the importance of the discriminant of the cubic equation to find algebraic solutions to certain types of cubic equations.

In his book &quot;Flos&quot;, Leonardo de Pisa, also known as Fibonacci (1170–1250), was able to closely approximate the positive solution to the cubic equation . Writing in Babylonian numerals he gave the result as 1,22,7,42,33,4,40 (equivalent to 1 + 22/60 + 7/602 + 42/603 + 33/604 + 4/605 + 40/606), which has a relative error of about 10−9.

In the early 16th century, the Italian mathematician Scipione del Ferro (1465–1526) found a method for solving a class of cubic equations, namely those of the form . In fact, all cubic equations can be reduced to this form if one allows and to be negative, but negative numbers were not known to him at that time. Del Ferro kept his achievement secret until just before his death, when he told his student Antonio Fior about it.

In 1535, Niccolò Tartaglia (1500–1557) received two problems in cubic equations from Zuanne da Coi and announced that he could solve them. He was soon challenged by Fior, which led to a famous contest between the two. Each contestant had to put up a certain amount of money and to propose a number of problems for his rival to solve. Whoever solved more problems within 30 days would get all the money. Tartaglia received questions in the form , for which he had worked out a general method. Fior received questions in the form , which proved to be too difficult for him to solve, and Tartaglia won the contest.

Later, Tartaglia was persuaded by Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576) to reveal his secret for solving cubic equations. In 1539, Tartaglia did so only on the condition that Cardano would never reveal it and that if he did write a book about cubics, he would give Tartaglia time to publish. Some years later, Cardano learned about del Ferro&#x27;s prior work and published del Ferro&#x27;s method in his book &quot;Ars Magna&quot; in 1545, meaning Cardano gave Tartaglia six years to publish his results (with credit given to Tartaglia for an independent solution). 

Cardano&#x27;s promise to Tartaglia said that he would not publish Tartaglia&#x27;s work, and Cardano felt he was publishing del Ferro&#x27;s, so as to get around the promise. Nevertheless, this led to a challenge to Cardano from Tartaglia, which Cardano denied. The challenge was eventually accepted by Cardano&#x27;s student Lodovico Ferrari (1522–1565). Ferrari did better than Tartaglia in the competition, and Tartaglia lost both his prestige and his income.

Cardano noticed that Tartaglia&#x27;s method sometimes required him to extract the square root of a negative number. He even included a calculation with these complex numbers in &quot;Ars Magna&quot;, but he did not really understand it. Rafael Bombelli studied this issue in detail and is therefore often considered as the discoverer of complex numbers.

François Viète (1540–1603) independently derived the trigonometric solution for the cubic with three real roots, and René Descartes (1596–1650) extended the work of Viète.

==Factorization==
If the coefficients of a cubic equation are rational numbers, one can obtain an equivalent equation with integer coefficients, by multiplying all coefficients by a common multiple of their denominators. Such an equation 
formula_2
with integer coefficients, is said to be reducible if the polynomial on the left-hand side is the product of polynomials of lower degrees. By Gauss&#x27;s lemma, if the equation is reducible, one can suppose that the factors have integer coefficients.

Finding the roots of a reducible cubic equation is easier than solving the general case. In fact, if the equation is reducible, one of the factors must have degree one, and thus have the form
formula_3
with and being coprime integers. The rational root test allows finding and by examining a finite number of cases (because must be a divisor of , and must be a divisor of ).

Thus, one root is formula_4 and the other roots are the roots of the other factor, which can be found by polynomial long division. This other factor is 
formula_5
(The coefficients seem not to be integers, but must be integers if is a root.)

Then, the other roots are the roots of this quadratic polynomial and can be found by using the quadratic formula.

==Depressed cubic==
Cubics of the form 
formula_6
are said to be depressed. They are much simpler than general cubics, but are fundamental, because the study of any cubic may be reduced by a simple change of variable to that of a depressed cubic.

Let 
formula_7
be a cubic equation. The change of variable
formula_8
gives a cubic (in ) that has no term in .

After dividing by one gets the &quot;depressed cubic equation&quot; 
formula_9
with 
formula_10

The roots formula_11 of the original equation are related to the roots formula_12 of the depressed equation by the relations 
formula_13
for formula_14.

==Discriminant and nature of the roots==
The nature (real or not, distinct or not) of the roots of a cubic can be determined without computing them explicitly, by using the discriminant.

===Discriminant===
The discriminant of a polynomial is a function of its coefficients that is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root, or, if it is divisible by the square of a non-constant polynomial. In other words, the discriminant is nonzero if and only if the polynomial is square-free.

If are the three roots (not necessarily distinct nor real) of the cubic formula_15 then the discriminant is
formula_16

The discriminant of the depressed cubic formula_17 is 
formula_18

The discriminant of the general cubic formula_19 is 
formula_20
It is the product of formula_21 and the discriminant of the corresponding depressed cubic. Using the formula relating the general cubic and the associated depressed cubic, this implies that the discriminant of the general cubic can be written as 
formula_22

It follows that one of these two discriminants is zero if and only if the other is also zero, and, if the coefficients are real, the two discriminants have the same sign. In summary, the same information can be deduced from either one of these two discriminants.

To prove the preceding formulas, one can use Vieta&#x27;s formulas to express everything as polynomials in , and . The proof then results in the verification of the equality of two polynomials.

===Nature of the roots===
If the coefficients of a polynomial are real numbers, and its discriminant formula_23 is not zero, there are two cases:
* If formula_24 the cubic has three distinct real roots
* If formula_25 the cubic has one real root and two non-real complex conjugate roots.

This can be proved as follows. First, if is a root of a polynomial with real coefficients, then its complex conjugate is also a root. So the non-real roots, if any, occur as pairs of complex conjugate roots. As a cubic polynomial has three roots (not necessarily distinct) by the fundamental theorem of algebra, at least one root must be real.

As stated above, if are the three roots of the cubic formula_19, then the discriminant is 
formula_27

If the three roots are real and distinct, the discriminant is a product of positive reals, that is formula_28

If only one root, say , is real, then and are complex conjugates, which implies that is a purely imaginary number, and thus that is real and negative. On the other hand, and are complex conjugates, and their product is real and positive. Thus the discriminant is the product of a single negative number and several positive ones. That is formula_29

===Multiple root===
If the discriminant of a cubic is zero, the cubic has a multiple root. If furthermore its coefficients are real, then all of its roots are real.

The discriminant of the depressed cubic formula_30 is zero if formula_31 If is also zero, then , and 0 is a triple root of the cubic. If formula_32 and , then the cubic has a simple root
formula_33

and a double root
formula_34

In other words,
formula_35

This result can be proved by expanding the latter product or retrieved by solving the rather simple system of equations resulting from Vieta&#x27;s formulas.

By using the reduction of a depressed cubic, these results can be extended to the general cubic. This gives: If the discriminant of the cubic formula_36 is zero, then

*either, if formula_37 the cubic has a triple root formula_38 and formula_39
*or, if formula_40 the cubic has a double root formula_41 and a simple root, formula_42 and thus formula_43

===Characteristic 2 and 3===
The above results are valid when the coefficients belong to a field of characteristic other than 2 or 3, but must be modified for characteristic 2 or 3, because of the involved divisions by 2 and 3.

The reduction to a depressed cubic works for characteristic 2, but not for characteristic 3. However, in both cases, it is simpler to establish and state the results for the general cubic. The main tool for that is the fact that a multiple root is a common root of the polynomial and its formal derivative. In these characteristics, if the derivative is not a constant, it is a linear polynomial in characteristic 3, and is the square of a linear polynomial in characteristic 2. Therefore, for either characteristic 2 or 3, the derivative has only one root. This allows computing the multiple root, and the third root can be deduced from the sum of the roots, which is provided by Vieta&#x27;s formulas.

A difference with other characteristics is that, in characteristic 2, the formula for a double root involves a square root, and, in characteristic 3, the formula for a triple root involves a cube root.
==Cardano&#x27;s formula==
Gerolamo Cardano is credited with publishing the first formula for solving cubic equations, attributing it to Scipione del Ferro and Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia. The formula applies to depressed cubics, but, as shown in , it allows solving all cubic equations.

Cardano&#x27;s result is that if 
formula_44
is a cubic equation such that and are real numbers such that formula_45 is positive (this implies that the discriminant of the equation is negative) then the equation has the real root
formula_46
where formula_47 and formula_48 are the two numbers formula_49 and formula_50

See , below, for several methods for getting this result.

As shown in , the two other roots are non-real complex conjugate numbers, in this case. It was later shown (Cardano did not know complex numbers) that the two other roots are obtained by multiplying one of the cube roots by the primitive cube root of unity formula_51 and the other cube root by the other primitive cube root of the unity formula_52 That is, the other roots of the equation are formula_53 and formula_54 

If formula_55 there are three real roots, but Galois theory allows proving that, if there is no rational root, the roots cannot be expressed by an algebraic expression involving only real numbers. Therefore, the equation cannot be solved in this case with the knowledge of Cardano&#x27;s time. This case has thus been called &quot;casus irreducibilis&quot;, meaning &quot;irreducible case&quot; in Latin.

In &quot;casus irreducibilis&quot;, Cardano&#x27;s formula can still be used, but some care is needed in the use of cube roots. A first method is to define the symbols formula_56 and formula_57 as representing the principal values of the root function (that is the root that has the largest real part). With this convention Cardano&#x27;s formula for the three roots remains valid, but is not purely algebraic, as the definition of a principal part is not purely algebraic, since it involves inequalities for comparing real parts. Also, the use of principal cube root may give a wrong result if the coefficients are non-real complex numbers. Moreover, if the coefficients belong to another field, the principal cube root is not defined in general.

The second way for making Cardano&#x27;s formula always correct, is to remark that the product of the two cube roots must be . It results that a root of the equation is 
formula_58
In this formula, the symbols formula_56 and formula_57 denote any square root and any cube root. The other roots of the equation are obtained either by changing of cube root or, equivalently, by multiplying the cube root by a primitive cube root of unity, that is formula_61

This formula for the roots is always correct except when , with the proviso that if , the square root is chosen so that . However, Cardano&#x27;s formula is useless if formula_62 as the roots are the cube roots of formula_63 Similarly, the formula is also useless in the cases where no cube root is needed, that is when the cubic polynomial is not irreducible; this includes the case formula_64

This formula is also correct when and belong to any field of characteristic other than 2 or 3.

==General cubic formula==
A &quot;cubic formula&quot; for the roots of the general cubic equation (with )
formula_1
can be deduced from every variant of Cardano&#x27;s formula by reduction to a depressed cubic. The variant that is presented here is valid not only for real coefficients, but also for coefficients belonging to any field of characteristic other than 2 or 3. If the coefficients are real numbers, the formula covers all complex solutions, not just real ones.

The formula being rather complicated, it is worth splitting it in smaller formulas.

Let
formula_66

(Both formula_67 and formula_68 can be expressed as resultants of the cubic and its derivatives: formula_68 is times the resultant of the cubic and its second derivative, and formula_67 is times the resultant of the first and second derivatives of the cubic polynomial.)

Then let
formula_71
where the symbols formula_56 and formula_57 are interpreted as &quot;any&quot; square root and &quot;any&quot; cube root, respectively (every nonzero complex number has two square roots and three cubic roots). The sign &quot; before the square root is either &quot; or &quot;&quot;; the choice is almost arbitrary, and changing it amounts to choosing a different square root. However, if a choice yields (this occurs if formula_74), then the other sign must be selected instead. If both choices yield , that is, if formula_75 a fraction occurs in following formulas; this fraction must be interpreted as equal to zero (see the end of this section).
With these conventions, one of the roots is
formula_76

The other two roots can be obtained by changing the choice of the cube root in the definition of , or, equivalently by multiplying by a primitive cube root of unity, that is . In other words, the three roots are 
formula_77
where .

As for the special case of a depressed cubic, this formula applies but is useless when the roots can be expressed without cube roots. In particular, if formula_75 the formula gives that the three roots equal formula_79 which means that the cubic polynomial can be factored as formula_80 A straightforward computation allows verifying that the existence of this factorization is equivalent with formula_81

==Trigonometric and hyperbolic solutions==

===Trigonometric solution for three real roots===
When a cubic equation with real coefficients has three real roots, the formulas expressing these roots in terms of radicals involve complex numbers. Galois theory allows proving that when the three roots are real, and none is rational (&quot;casus irreducibilis&quot;), one cannot express the roots in terms of real radicals. Nevertheless, purely real expressions of the solutions may be obtained using trigonometric functions, specifically in terms of cosines and arccosines. More precisely, the roots of the depressed cubic
formula_82
are 
formula_83

This formula is due to François Viète. It is purely real when the equation has three real roots (that is formula_84). Otherwise, it is still correct but involves complex cosines and arccosines when there is only one real root, and it is nonsensical (division by zero) when .

This formula can be straightforwardly transformed into a formula for the roots of a general cubic equation, using the back-substitution described in . 

The formula can be proved as follows: Starting from the equation , let us set The idea is to choose to make the equation coincide with the identity
formula_85
For this, choose formula_86 and divide the equation by formula_87 This gives 
formula_88
Combining with the above identity, one gets 
formula_89
and the roots are thus 
formula_90

===Hyperbolic solution for one real root===

When there is only one real root (and ), this root can be similarly represented using hyperbolic functions, as 
formula_91
If and the inequalities on the right are not satisfied (the case of three real roots), the formulas remain valid but involve complex quantities.

When , the above values of are sometimes called the Chebyshev cube root. More precisely, the values involving cosines and hyperbolic cosines define, when , the same analytic function denoted , which is the proper Chebyshev cube root. The value involving hyperbolic sines is similarly denoted , when .

==Geometric solutions==

===Omar Khayyám&#x27;s solution===
For solving the cubic equation where , Omar Khayyám constructed the parabola , the circle that has as a diameter the line segment on the positive -axis, and a vertical line through the point where the circle and the parabola intersect above the -axis. The solution is given by the length of the horizontal line segment from the origin to the intersection of the vertical line and the -axis (see the figure).

A simple modern proof is as follows. Multiplying the equation by and regrouping the terms gives 
formula_92
The left-hand side is the value of on the parabola. The equation of the circle being , the right hand side is the value of on the circle.

===Solution with angle trisector===
A cubic equation with real coefficients can be solved geometrically using compass, straightedge, and an angle trisector if and only if it has three real roots.

A cubic equation can be solved by compass-and-straightedge construction (without trisector) if and only if it has a rational root. This implies that the old problems of angle trisection and doubling the cube, set by ancient Greek mathematicians, cannot be solved by compass-and-straightedge construction.

==Geometric interpretation of the roots==

===Three real roots===
Viète&#x27;s trigonometric expression of the roots in the three-real-roots case lends itself to a geometric interpretation in terms of a circle. When the cubic is written in depressed form (), , as shown above, the solution can be expressed as

formula_93

Here formula_94 is an angle in the unit circle; taking of that angle corresponds to taking a cube root of a complex number; adding for finds the other cube roots; and multiplying the cosines of these resulting angles by formula_95 corrects for scale.

For the non-depressed case () (shown in the accompanying graph), the depressed case as indicated previously is obtained by defining such that so . Graphically this corresponds to simply shifting the graph horizontally when changing between the variables and , without changing the angle relationships. This shift moves the point of inflection and the centre of the circle onto the -axis. Consequently, the roots of the equation in sum to zero.

===One real root===

====In the Cartesian plane====
When the graph of a cubic function is plotted in the Cartesian plane, if there is only one real root, it is the abscissa (-coordinate) of the horizontal intercept of the curve (point R on the figure). Further, if the complex conjugate roots are written as , then the real part is the abscissa of the tangency point H of the tangent line to cubic that passes through -intercept R of the cubic (that is the signed length OM, negative on the figure). The imaginary parts are the square roots of the tangent of the angle between this tangent line and the horizontal axis.

====In the complex plane====
With one real and two complex roots, the three roots can be represented as points in the complex plane, as can the two roots of the cubic&#x27;s derivative. There is an interesting geometrical relationship among all these roots.

The points in the complex plane representing the three roots serve as the vertices of an isosceles triangle. (The triangle is isosceles because one root is on the horizontal (real) axis and the other two roots, being complex conjugates, appear symmetrically above and below the real axis.) Marden&#x27;s theorem says that the points representing the roots of the derivative of the cubic are the foci of the Steiner inellipse of the triangle—the unique ellipse that is tangent to the triangle at the midpoints of its sides. If the angle at the vertex on the real axis is less than then the major axis of the ellipse lies on the real axis, as do its foci and hence the roots of the derivative. If that angle is greater than , the major axis is vertical and its foci, the roots of the derivative, are complex conjugates. And if that angle is , the triangle is equilateral, the Steiner inellipse is simply the triangle&#x27;s incircle, its foci coincide with each other at the incenter, which lies on the real axis, and hence the derivative has duplicate real roots.

==Galois group==
Given a cubic irreducible polynomial over a field of characteristic different from 2 and 3, the Galois group over is the group of the field automorphisms that fix of the smallest extension of (splitting field). As these automorphisms must permute the roots of the polynomials, this group is either the group of all six permutations of the three roots, or the group of the three circular permutations.

The discriminant of the cubic is the square of 
formula_96
where is the leading coefficient of the cubic, and , and are the three roots of the cubic. As formula_97 changes of sign if two roots are exchanged, formula_97 is fixed by the Galois group only if the Galois group is 
. In other words, the Galois group is if and only if the discriminant is the square of an element of .

As most integers are not squares, when working over the field of the rational numbers, the Galois group of most irreducible cubic polynomials is the group with six elements. An example of a Galois group with three elements is given by , whose discriminant is .

==Derivation of the roots==
This section regroups several methods for deriving Cardano&#x27;s formula.

===Cardano&#x27;s method===
This method is due to Scipione del Ferro and Tartaglia, but is named after Gerolamo Cardano who first published it in his book &quot;Ars Magna&quot; (1545).

This method applies to a depressed cubic . The idea is to introduce two variables and formula_99 such that formula_100 and to substitute this in the depressed cubic, giving
formula_101

At this point Cardano imposed the condition formula_102 This removes the third term in previous equality, leading to the system of equations
formula_103

Knowing the sum and the product of and formula_104 one deduces that they are the two solutions of the quadratic equation 
formula_105 
so
formula_106
The discriminant of this equation is formula_107, and assuming it is positive, real solutions to this equation are (after folding division by 4 under the square root):
formula_108
So (without loss of generality in choosing or formula_99):
formula_110
formula_111
As formula_112 the sum of the cube roots of these solutions is a root of the equation. That is 
formula_113
is a root of the equation; this is Cardano&#x27;s formula.

This works well when formula_114 but, if formula_55 the square root appearing in the formula is not real. As a complex number has three cube roots, using Cardano&#x27;s formula without care would provide nine roots, while a cubic equation cannot have more than three roots. This was clarified first by Rafael Bombelli in his book &quot;L&#x27;Algebra&quot; (1572). The solution is to use the fact that formula_116 that is, formula_117 This means that only one cube root needs to be computed, and leads to the second formula given in .

The other roots of the equation can be obtained by changing of cube root, or, equivalently, by multiplying the cube root by each of the two primitive cube roots of unity, which are formula_118

===Vieta&#x27;s substitution===
Vieta&#x27;s substitution is a method introduced by François Viète (Vieta is his Latin name) in a text published posthumously in 1615, which provides directly the second formula of , and avoids the problem of computing two different cube roots.

Starting from the depressed cubic , Vieta&#x27;s substitution is .

The substitution transforms the depressed cubic into
formula_119

Multiplying by , one gets a quadratic equation in :
formula_120

Let 
formula_121 
be any nonzero root of this quadratic equation. If , and are the three cube roots of , then the roots of the original depressed cubic are , , and . The other root of the quadratic equation is formula_122 This implies that changing the sign of the square root exchanges and for , and therefore does not change the roots. This method only fails when both roots of the quadratic equation are zero, that is when , in which case the only root of the depressed cubic is .

===Lagrange&#x27;s method===
In his paper &quot;Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations&quot; (&quot;Thoughts on the algebraic solving of equations&quot;), Joseph Louis Lagrange introduced a new method to solve equations of low degree in a uniform way, with the hope that he could generalize it for higher degrees. This method works well for cubic and quartic equations, but Lagrange did not succeed in applying it to a quintic equation, because it requires solving a resolvent polynomial of degree at least six. 
Apart from the fact that nobody had previously succeeded, this was the first indication of the non-existence of an algebraic formula for degrees 5 and higher; as was later proved by the Abel–Ruffini theorem. Nevertheless, modern methods for solving solvable quintic equations are mainly based on Lagrange&#x27;s method.

In the case of cubic equations, Lagrange&#x27;s method gives the same solution as Cardano&#x27;s. Lagrange&#x27;s method can be applied directly to the general cubic equation , but the computation is simpler with the depressed cubic equation, .

Lagrange&#x27;s main idea was to work with the discrete Fourier transform of the roots instead of with the roots themselves. More precisely, let be a primitive third root of unity, that is a number such that and (when working in the space of complex numbers, one has formula_123 but this complex interpretation is not used here). Denoting , and the three roots of the cubic equation to be solved, let
formula_124
be the discrete Fourier transform of the roots. If , and are known, the roots may be recovered from them with the inverse Fourier transform consisting of inverting this linear transformation; that is,
formula_125

By Vieta&#x27;s formulas, is known to be zero in the case of a depressed cubic, and for the general cubic. So, only and need to be computed. They are not symmetric functions of the roots (exchanging and exchanges also and ), but some simple symmetric functions of and are also symmetric in the roots of the cubic equation to be solved. Thus these symmetric functions can be expressed in terms of the (known) coefficients of the original cubic, and this allows eventually expressing the as roots of a polynomial with known coefficients. This works well for every degree, but, in degrees higher than four, the resulting polynomial that has the as roots has a degree higher than that of the initial polynomial, and is therefore unhelpful for solving. This is the reason for which Lagrange&#x27;s method fails in degrees five and higher.

In the case of a cubic equation, formula_126 and formula_127 are such symmetric polynomials (see below). It follows that formula_128 and formula_129 are the two roots of the quadratic equation formula_130 Thus the resolution of the equation may be finished exactly as with Cardano&#x27;s method, with formula_131 and formula_132 in place of and formula_133

In the case of the depressed cubic, one has formula_134 and formula_135 while in Cardano&#x27;s method we have set formula_136 and formula_137 Thus, up to the exchange of and formula_138 we have formula_139 and formula_140 In other words, in this case, Cardano&#x27;s method and Lagrange&#x27;s method compute exactly the same things, up to a factor of three in the auxiliary variables, the main difference being that Lagrange&#x27;s method explains why these auxiliary variables appear in the problem.

====Computation of and ====
A straightforward computation using the relations and gives 
formula_141
This shows that and are symmetric functions of the roots. Using Newton&#x27;s identities, it is straightforward to express them in terms of the elementary symmetric functions of the roots, giving
formula_142
with , and in the case of a depressed cubic, and , and , in the general case.

<text>Martha Elenor Maguire (née Erwin, previously Seidel; October 12, 1969) is an American musician who is a founding member of the country band the Chicks and the country bluegrass duo Court Yard Hounds. She won awards in national fiddle championships while still a teenager. Maguire is accomplished on several other instruments, including the mandolin, viola, double bass and guitar. She has written and co-written a number of the band&#x27;s songs, some of which have become chart-topping hits. She also contributes her skills in vocal harmony and backing vocals, as well as orchestrating string arrangements for the band.

Martie learned several instruments at a young age, honing her skills with her younger sister, Emily and two schoolmates (a brother and sister team, Troy and Sharon Gilchrist) for over five years as a part of a touring bluegrass quartet while in high school. After graduation, the sisters forged an alliance with two other women they had met through the Dallas music scene, Laura Lynch and Robin Lynn Macy, forming a bluegrass and country music band, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits for six years. After the departure of Macy, and the replacement of Lynch with singer Natalie Maines, the band widened their musical repertoire and appearance. The result was a trio so commercially successful that it took the country music industry by surprise, with 19 singles hitting the Billboard Country Charts, 2 Diamond Albums, 2 Platinum albums, and 13 Grammy Awards. Maguire subsequently stood by her bandmates as they were engulfed in a 2003 controversy for criticizing George W. Bush, which led to the Chicks being blacklisted by many country radio stations.

==Early life==
Martha Elenor Erwin, nicknamed Martie, was born October 12, 1969, in York, Pennsylvania.

Encouraged by her parents – educators at private schools – Martie began playing violin at age five, and by age 12, started to learn to play &quot;fiddle style&quot; after receiving a birthday gift of fiddle lessons. She also was active in her school orchestra.

Her sister Emily shared her love and interest in music, and displayed early talent herself. The two sisters were provided musical instruction on several instruments, and their talent for vocal harmony continued to be nurtured. Although Maguire became famous for her harmony and mastery of the fiddle, she also plays a variety of strings that include the viola, guitar, mandolin, and double bass. Maguire composes songs and arranges the use of stringed instruments for concert and recording performances.

==Early career==
By 1983, Martie was touring with her sister Emily and school friends siblings Troy and Sharon Gilchrist. The sisters showed an &quot;almost obsessive&quot; interest in busking at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals. The four students formed the teenage bluegrass group &quot;Blue Night Express&quot;, playing together for five years, from 1984 to 1989, while still attending private Greenhill School. &quot;We&#x27;d drive down to the west end of Dallas and open our cases, and that was our job,&quot; Martie said of it in a later interview to 60 Minutes II correspondent Dan Rather. &quot;That&#x27;s how we made money in high school.&quot; Also while in high school Martie performed at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington, TX, in a strolling duo with Troy Gilchrist for a summer.

In 1987, Martie was awarded second place for the fiddle in the National fiddle championships held yearly in Winfield, Kansas. Upon graduation from high school, with Emily still in high school, she spent a year attending college at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, from 1988 to 1989. She performed in the school orchestra there and again competed in the national fiddle championships at the Walnut Valley Festival, in Winfield, earning third place that year.

In the 90s she played occasionally with the slo-core band, Bedhead.

==The Chicks==

In 1989, Martie and Emily joined guitarist Robin Lynn Macy and Laura Lynch on double bass in the Dixie Chicks, playing what was at the time predominantly bluegrass music and a mix of country standards. Originally listed as Martha, and then Martie Erwin, she played fiddle, mandolin, viola and harmonized with Emily on backing vocals.

Martie had begun writing and recording songs on their debut independent album, &quot;Thank Heavens for Dale Evans&quot;, and in 2001, one song co-written with Laura Lynch called &quot;Pink Toenails&quot; resurfaced. The song was featured in the film, &quot;Don&#x27;t Say A Word&quot;, with Skye McCole Bartusiak performing the song.

When their second album had a more polished sound, Martie commented, &quot;I hope our fans won&#x27;t be disappointed [in &quot;The Little Ol&#x27; Cowgirl&quot;]; it&#x27;s got drums on every track; it&#x27;s no longer bluegrass, but we have to make a living and you can&#x27;t do that playing bluegrass.&quot;

Two albums later, after Natalie Maines became the lead vocalist of the Chicks, the band&#x27;s commercial success skyrocketed. Martie said of their music, &quot;It&#x27;s very rootsy, but then Natalie comes in with a rock and blues influence. That gave Emily and I a chance to branch out, because we loved those kinds of music but felt limited by our instruments.&quot;
Martie co-wrote the song, &quot;Cowboy Take Me Away&quot; on the Chicks&#x27; album &quot;Fly&quot; for her sister Emily. It was a tribute to Emily&#x27;s courtship with country music writer/singer Charlie Robison. Martie was singled out by BMI in 2000, and awarded Songwriter of the Year for writing and/or co-writing &quot;Cowboy Take Me Away&quot;, &quot;Ready To Run&quot; and &quot;You Were Mine&quot;. &quot;You Were Mine&quot; was co-written by the sisters about their parents&#x27; divorce.

In 1999, the Dixie Chicks performed two songs, recording a cover of the song, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurry Love&quot; as well as Martie&#x27;s &quot;Ready to Run&quot; for the Julia Roberts/ Richard Gere film &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;. In 2003, Martie was nominated for a Tony Award for co-composing the film score to &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;; the musical used her &quot;Cowboy Take Me Away&quot;.

After the band achieved massive commercial success with its first two Sony studio albums with Maines, they struggled with their record company over artistic direction on the third. Martie commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t think any of us ever trusted Nashville. When you&#x27;re in that town you know everybody is talking about everybody else. Everybody is wishing for the other guy to fail.&quot;

Although Martie and Emily often appear quiet and demure compared to their animated bandmate Natalie Maines, the trio have stood united on controversial subjects since they banded together to play in 1995, even when their opinions have had the potential to serve them more harm than good. In 2006, Martie said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather have a smaller following of really cool people who get it, who will grow with us as we grow and are fans for life, than people that have us in their five-disc changer with Reba McEntire and Toby Keith. We don&#x27;t want those kinds of fans. They limit what you can do.&quot;

==Court Yard Hounds==
With Natalie Maines taking a break from music, Martie was working on a solo fiddle album; however, it was announced in January 2010 that she and sister Emily Strayer have formed a side project called the Court Yard Hounds, with Emily on lead vocals. The band made their live debut in March at South by Southwest with an album released in May 2010.

==Personal life==
Martie married pharmaceutical representative Ted Seidel on June 17, 1995, and changed her last name to Seidel. She also was stepmother to his son. However, her marriage did not last, and she and Ted Seidel were divorced in November 1999.

At bandmate Natalie Maines&#x27; sister Kim&#x27;s wedding, Martie met Gareth Maguire, a Roman Catholic teacher and actor from Carnlough, Northern Ireland. The couple became engaged in June 2001 and married on August 10, 2001, in a civil ceremony in Hawaii; as explained at one of their concerts, the Dixie Chicks&#x27; song &quot;White Trash Wedding&quot; is based on Martie&#x27;s relationship with Gareth. Later they had a Catholic &quot;blessing&quot; ceremony in the groom&#x27;s hometown, Carnlough in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, on March 9, 2002, for all the guests that were not able to attend the first wedding. Martie said of the ceremony that the Catholic Church would not permit a wedding service due to her prior divorce. Martie said that there were many &quot;special&quot; people that they had wanted to include, but that they just could not wait to marry. Another reason for the rush was Gareth&#x27;s need to keep flying back and forth between the United States and Ireland because of visa considerations. After her second marriage, Martie changed her name to that of her new husband, which is why in her musical career she has been credited by all three of her surnames: Erwin, Seidel, and Maguire.

Martie and her second husband had three daughters together. Their third daughter was born in 2008. The couple divorced in 2013. In February 2022, it was revealed Martie is married to Clem Moore.

Martie has been frank about using in vitro fertilization to conceive their daughters. In an interview in &quot;Conceive&quot;, she said, &quot;All my paperwork said &#x27;unspecified origin.&#x27; We spent three years of active trying before we went to IVF. First I went on Clomid. Then I had some dye tests and found I had a collapsed tube, so I had laparoscopic surgery; the tube wasn&#x27;t blocked, just spasming.&quot; After three attempts at intrauterine insemination, she said, she and her husband didn&#x27;t think it was worth continuing in that manner, and switched to IVF. In August 2007, Martie began IVF again, resulting in their third daughter. In 2008, regarding the number of children the Dixie Chicks had produced in the past seven years (Maines had two; Emily had four in addition to Martie&#x27;s twins and newborn), Martie told &quot;People&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ll have to move over and let the little chicks take over! We&#x27;ve got a new band!&quot;

Martie and Emily co-wrote a song, &quot;So Hard&quot;, about their own personal experiences with infertility and their need to rely on other methods to conceive. They speak out about the difficulties they faced, but also their good fortune; both having options that for many women are financially prohibitive. Mentioning the stigma attached to IVF, Martie said, &quot;I think we feel a responsibility to break down some barriers. It&#x27;s much more of a common problem than people realize.&quot; A final concern Martie mentioned was the question of what to do with all the unused frozen embryos.Now that I have children, I see those embryos as possible children. So I have to think about what my options are if there are leftovers again. I could keep them in storage, and maybe they will help my children some day. Or I can try to donate them to stem cell research. I don&#x27;t think I could give them to another family. I would always worry: what if it&#x27;s an abusive family? What if they don&#x27;t get enough love?

Natalie Maines has noted that she and Martie learned Transcendental Meditation in the mid-1990s.

<doc id="180790" wikidata="Q585575" url="?curid=180790" title="Emily Strayer">
<text>Emily Burns Strayer ( Erwin, previously Robison; born August 16, 1972) is an American songwriter, singer, multi-instrumentalist, and a founding member of the country band the Chicks, formerly known as the Dixie Chicks. Strayer plays banjo, dobro, guitar, lap steel, bass, mandolin, accordion, fiddle, piano, and sitar. Initially in her career with the Chicks, she limited her singing to harmony with backing vocals, but within her role in the Court Yard Hounds, she took on the role of lead vocalist.

==Early life==

Emily Erwin was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Parents Paul Erwin and Barbara Trask moved the family to the suburban town of Addison, Texas, on the northern edge of Dallas, where she was raised with her two older sisters, Julia and Martha. Her parents were both educators and nurtured the growing interest that both Emily and Martha (later nicknamed Martie) shared, and together both sisters became proficient on several instruments while in elementary school.

Emily began playing the violin at age seven, and the banjo at age ten, afterward learning all the string instruments she could find. Years later, Martie joked that Emily was better than she at the fiddle, and because she wanted to keep the fiddle as her instrument, she forced Emily to learn something else. Emily responded by mastering the five string banjo, by reading books to teach herself the chord progressions.

From 1984–1989, Jane Frost (Director of the Patsy Montana Museum and the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas) remembers watching the sisters mature, teaming up with schoolmates Troy and Sharon Gilchrist. The foursome were touring in a teenage bluegrass group they named the Blue Night Express, in part because of the amount of traveling they had to do to reach far away festivals, frequently with a parent or friend of the family towing them back home long after dark at night. They thought it was worth the sacrifices to meet their musical heroes and experienced the friendly camaraderie and tricks of the trade on instruments from others. The sisters were said to have an &quot;almost obsessive&quot; interest in busking at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals. After Martie graduated from secondary school at Greenhill School with Emily still completing her studies, both remained active in the bluegrass scene.

==The Chicks==
In 1989, after years of attending bluegrass festivals and busking where they could, Emily joined her sister Martie, guitarist Robin Lynn Macy, and upright bass player Laura Lynch. Frost, again, recalls being privy to the discussion that the four women had about the possibility of a successful career as musicians together. Martie felt they could do well. Robin said, &quot;.. It&#x27;s going to be a &#x27;hot&#x27; band,&quot; to which Emily responded, &quot;I give it six months, and if we aren&#x27;t making money by then, I&#x27;m out of here!&quot;. Emily was shy, and the youngest member of the group. She had enjoyed playing throughout school, but was at an age where she was already entertaining thoughts of working hard to be accepted by the United States Air Force Academy.

By 1993, the band had evolved into a new direction. Macy left the group for a &quot;purer&quot; bluegrass sound. Lynch, thrust into the position of sole lead singer, was replaced by the sisters in 1995 with singer composer Natalie Maines after the group was unable to garner anything more than local interest. Emily commented, &quot;We were prepared to pay our dues for as long as it took; we were prepared for longevity. We know that we will always be playing music together, so we wanted to find someone who is just as determined and energetic as we are.&quot;

But in later interviews, the sisters revealed what many had thought for a long time: the reason Lynch was replaced was not commitment but a perceived lack of talent. In an article in the April/May edition of &quot;Country Music Magazine&quot;, Emily stated, &quot;We felt we needed the next calibre of singer.&quot;

From there, massive commercial success ensued, with their 1998 and 1999 albums &quot;Wide Open Spaces&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot; both achieving diamond record status. Emily was a key element of the group&#x27;s look, with her hair dyed blond to match the other two at first, and then allowing it to return to her natural brunette color, and distinguishing herself visually from the other two. Emily and Martie&#x27;s instrumental virtuosity set the Dixie Chicks apart from many other country acts, male and female. Emily&#x27;s songwriting has also been a factor in the Chicks&#x27; recording career. 

Emily stood by Maines when the controversy over Maines&#x27; remarks about U.S. President George W. Bush hit the newswire on the eve before the Iraq War in 2003. She was the only bandmate to realize that - while in the U.K., there was a big anti-war sentiment in the audience - back in the United States, Maines&#x27; criticism of President Bush would not be well received. Nevertheless, even when her home was trashed, and plenty of editorials were predicting the end of the Dixie Chicks&#x27; successful careers in music, she remained loyal to Maines, as did her sister.
==Court Yard Hounds==

Emily spent at least half of her life busking and touring nearly non-stop since high school, first with her older sister, and then with the changing lineups of the Dixie Chicks. After the bandmates celebrated their five Grammy Awards for &quot;Taking the Long Way&quot;, the trio all had young children and took time out to spend with them, but Emily was eager to return to writing and touring. When Emily&#x27;s marriage came to an end, she began expressing herself by songwriting. Some of her compositions include her feelings about the breakup with her former husband, and expected that soon, the band would resume its former schedule of writing and performing, but Natalie Maines was reluctant to do so. After four years, Emily became &quot;angry and frustrated&quot;, and in sending her new songs to her sister, conveyed her increasing disappointment. With Natalie Maines taking a break from music, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine announced in January 2010 that Emily and sister Martie have formed a side project called the Court Yard Hounds, with Emily as lead vocalist. The band made their live debut in March at South by Southwest with an album released in May 2010. Emily wrote all but one of the songs on their album.

==Personal life==
On May 1, 1999, she married country singer Charlie Robison. Their wedding was held at the Cibolo Creek Ranch. Martie Maguire later revealed on a VH1 program that during their courtship, she had written the romantic hit song, &quot;Cowboy Take Me Away&quot; for them. They have three children. They divorced on August 6, 2008.

She became romantically involved with Martin Strayer while composing the Court Yard Hounds album. With Strayer, she has a daughter. The couple later married in 2013.

<text>Johann Georg Walch (17 June 1693 – 13 January 1775) was a German Lutheran theologian.

==Life==
He was born in Meiningen, where his father, Georg Walch, was general superintendent. He studied at Leipzig and Jena, amongst his teachers being J. F. Buddeus, whose only daughter he married. He published in 1716 a work, &quot;Historia critica Latinae linguae&quot;, which soon came into wide use. Two years later he became professor extraordinarius of philosophy at Jena. In 1719, he was appointed professor ordinarius of rhetoric, in 1721 of poetry, and in 1724 professor extraordinarius of theology. In 1728 he became professor ordinarius of theology, and in 1730 professor primarius.

His theological position was that of moderate orthodoxy, greatly influenced by the philosophy and controversies of the Deistic period. His university lectures and published works ranged over the wide fields of church history in its various branches, particularly the literature and the controversies of the church, dogmatics, ethics and pastoral theology.

Of his works the most valuable were &quot;Bibliotheca theologica&quot; (1757–1765); &quot;Bibliotheca patristica&quot; (1770); his edition of Luther&#x27;s works in 24 vols. (1740–1752); &quot;Historische und theologische Einleitung in die religiösen Streitigkeiten, welche sonderlich ausser der evangelische-lutherischen Kirche entstanden&quot; (5 vols., 1733 ff.); the companion work to this, &quot;Einleitung in die Religionsstreitigkeiten der evangel.-luth. Kirche&quot; (1730–1739), and &quot;Philosophisches Lexikon&quot; (1726, 4th ed. 1775).

Also important is the &quot;Historia logicae&quot;, published in Leipzig in 1721.

His life, with a complete list of his writings, which amounted to 287, &quot;Leben und Charakter des Kirchenraths J. G. Walch&quot;, was published anonymously by his son CWF Walch (Jena, 1777). Cf. Wilhelm Gass, &quot;Protestantische Dogmatik&quot;, iii. p. 205 sq.

His sons, Johann Ernst Immanuel and Christian Wilhelm Franz Walch were also noted theologians. Son Karl Friedrich Walch became a law professor.

Johann Georg Walch died in Jena on 13 January 1775.

<text>Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch (29 August 1725 – 1 December 1778) was a German theologian, linguist, and naturalist from Jena.

==Life==
The son of the theologian Johann Georg Walch, he studied Semitic languages at the University of Jena, and also natural science and mathematics. In 1749 he published &quot;Einleitung in die Harmonie der Evangelien&quot;, and in 1750 was appointed professor extraordinarius of theology. Five years later he became professor ordinarius of logic and metaphysics; in 1759 he exchanged this for a professorship of rhetoric and poetry.

Amongst his theological works were &quot;Dissertationes in Acta Apostolorum&quot; (1756–1761); (1772); and after his death appeared &quot;Observationes in Matthaeum ex Graecis inscriptionibus&quot; (1779). He also edited a periodical &quot;Der Naturforscher&quot; (1774–1778), and during the years 1749-1756 took an active part in editing the &quot;Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen&quot;.

In the later part of his career Walch found interest in the natural sciences, particularly fossils and geology. One significant result was the beautifully illustrated, four-volume &quot;Die Naturgeschichte der Versteinerungen&quot; (&quot;The Natural History of
Petrifactions&quot;), released from 1768 to 1773, and also published in French and Dutch editions. A comprehensive chapter on trilobites in 1771
contains the first use of the word &quot;trilobite&quot; and predates other equally comprehensive treatments by 50 years.

Walch died in Jena. His brother Christian Wilhelm Franz Walch was also theologian.

<text>STS-9 (also referred to Spacelab 1) was the ninth NASA Space Shuttle mission and the sixth mission of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. Launched on November 28, 1983, the ten-day mission carried the first Spacelab laboratory module into orbit.

STS-9 was also the last time the original STS numbering system was used until STS-26, which was designated in the aftermath of the 1986 &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster of STS-51-L. Under the new system, STS-9 would have been designated as STS-41-A. STS-9&#x27;s originally planned successor, STS-10, was canceled due to payload issues; it was instead followed by STS-41-B. After this mission, &quot;Columbia&quot; was taken out of service for renovations and did not fly again until STS-61-C in early January 1986.

STS-9 sent the first non-U.S. citizen into space on the Shuttle, Ulf Merbold, becoming the first ESA and first West German citizen to go into space.

== Crew ==

=== Support crew ===
* John E. Blaha (entry CAPCOM)
* Franklin R. Chang-Diaz
* Mary L. Cleave
* Anna L. Fisher
* William F. Fisher
* Guy S. Gardner (ascent CAPCOM)
* Charles Lewis (Marshall CAPCOM)
* William Bock (Marshall CAPCOM)
* Bryan D. O&#x27;Connor
* Wubbo Ockels

=== Crew seat assignments ===
== Mission background ==
STS-9&#x27;s six-member crew, the largest of any human space mission at the time, included John W. Young, commander, on his second shuttle flight; Brewster H. Shaw, pilot; Owen K. Garriott and Robert A. Parker, both mission specialists; and Byron K. Lichtenberg and Ulf Merbold, payload specialists – the first two non-NASA astronauts to fly on the Space Shuttle. Merbold, a citizen of West Germany, was the first foreign citizen to participate in a Space Shuttle flight. Lichtenberg was a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Prior to STS-9, the scientist-astronaut Garriott had spent 56 days in orbit in 1973 aboard Skylab. Commanding the mission was veteran astronaut John W. Young, making his sixth and final flight over an 18-year career that saw him fly twice each in Project Gemini, Apollo, and the Space Shuttle, which included two journeys to the Moon and making him the most experienced space traveler to date. Young, who also commanded &quot;Columbia&quot; on its maiden voyage STS-1, was the first person to fly the same space vehicle into orbit more than once. STS-9 marked the only time that two pre-Shuttle era astronaut veterans (Garriott and Young) would fly on the same Space Shuttle mission. STS-9 was also the first Space Shuttle mission to have more than one veteran astronaut.

The mission was devoted entirely to Spacelab 1, a joint NASA/European Space Agency (ESA) program designed to demonstrate the ability to conduct advanced scientific research in space. Both the mission specialists and payload specialists worked in the Spacelab module and coordinated their efforts with scientists at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Payload Operations Control Center (POCC), which was then located at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Texas. Funding for Spacelab 1 was provided by the ESA.

== Shuttle processing ==
After &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; return from STS-5 in November 1982, it received several modifications and changes in preparation for STS-9. Most of these changes were intended to support the Spacelab module and crew, such as the addition of a tunnel connecting the Spacelab to the orbiter&#x27;s airlock, and additional provisions for the mission&#x27;s six crew members, such as a galley and sleeping bunks. &quot;Columbia&quot; also received the more powerful Space Shuttle Main Engines introduced with &quot;Challenger&quot;, which were rated for 104% maximum thrust; its original main engines were later refurbished for use with &quot;Atlantis&quot;, which was still under construction at the time. Also added to the shuttle were higher capacity fuel cells and a Ku-band antenna for use with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS).

The mission&#x27;s original launch date of October 29, 1983, was scrubbed due to concerns with the exhaust nozzle on the right solid rocket booster (SRB). For the first time in the history of the shuttle program, the shuttle stack was rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), where it was destacked and the orbiter returned to the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF), while the suspect booster underwent repairs. The shuttle was restacked and returned to the launch pad on November 8, 1983.

== Launch attempts ==
== Mission insignia ==
The mission&#x27;s main payload, Spacelab 1, is depicted in the payload bay of the &quot;Columbia&quot;. The nine stars and the path of the orbiter indicate the flight&#x27;s numerical designation, STS-9.

== Mission summary ==
STS-9 launched successfully from Kennedy Space Center at 11:00:00 a.m. EST on November 28, 1983. The shuttle&#x27;s crew was divided into two teams, each working 12-hour shifts for the duration of the mission. Young, Parker and Merbold formed the Red Team, while Shaw, Garriott and Lichtenberg made up the Blue Team. Usually, Young and Shaw were assigned to the flight deck, while the mission and payload specialists worked inside the Spacelab.

Over the course of the mission, 72 scientific experiments were carried out, spanning the fields of atmospheric and plasma physics, astronomy, solar physics, material sciences, technology, astrobiology and Earth observations. The Spacelab effort went so well that the mission was extended an additional day to 10 days, making it the longest-duration shuttle flight at that time. In addition, Garriott made the first ham radio transmissions by an amateur radio operator in space during the flight. This led to many further space flights incorporating amateur radio as an educational and back-up communications tool.

The Spacelab 1 mission was highly successful, proving the feasibility of the concept of carrying out complex experiments in space using non-NASA persons trained as payload specialists in collaboration with a POCC. Moreover, the TDRS-1 satellite, now fully operational, was able to relay significant amounts of data through its ground terminal to the POCC.

During orbiter orientation, four hours before re-entry, one of the flight control computers crashed when the Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters were fired. A few minutes later, a second crashed in a similar fashion, but was successfully rebooted. Young delayed the landing, letting the orbiter drift. He later testified: &quot;Had we then activated the Backup Flight Software, loss of vehicle and crew would have resulted&quot;. Post-flight analysis revealed the GPCs &quot;(General Purpose Computers)&quot; failed when the RCS thruster motion knocked a piece of solder loose and shorted out the CPU board. A GPC running BFS may or may not have the same soldering defect as the rest of the GPCs. Switching the vehicle to the BFS from normal flight control can happen relatively instantaneously, and that particular GPC running the BFS could also be affected by the same failure due to the soldering defect. If such a failure occurred, switching the vehicle back to normal flight control software on multiple GPCs from a single GPC running BFS takes a lot longer, in essence leaving the vehicle without any control at all during the change.

&quot;Columbia&quot; landed on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base on December 8, 1983, at 03:47:24 p.m. PST, having completed 167 orbits and travelled over the course of its mission. Right before landing, two of the orbiter&#x27;s three auxiliary power units (APUs) caught fire due to a hydrazine leak, but the orbiter nonetheless landed successfully. &quot;Columbia&quot; was ferried back to KSC on December 15, 1983. The leak was later discovered after it had burned itself out and caused major damage to the compartment. By this time, &quot;Discovery&quot; had been delivered just three weeks before the launch of STS-9. This allowed NASA to take &quot;Columbia&quot; out of service for an extensive renovation and upgrade program to bring it up to date with &quot;Challenger&quot; as well as &quot;Discovery&quot; and later on &quot;Atlantis&quot;, which would be delivered in 1985. As a result, &quot;Columbia&quot; would not fly at all during 1984–1985.

<text>Menander I Soter (, ; ), sometimes called Menander the Great, was a Greco-Bactrian and later Indo-Greek King (reigned /155 –130 BC) who administered a large territory in the Northwestern regions of the Indian Subcontinent and Central Asia. Menander is noted for having become a patron and convert to Greco-Buddhism and he is widely regarded as the greatest of the Indo-Greek kings. 

Menander might have initially been a king of Bactria. After conquering the Punjab, as far as Taxila, he established an empire which stretched from the Kabul River in the west to the Ravi River in the east, and from the Swat River valley in the north to Arachosia (the Helmand Province). The Greek geographer Strabo wrote that he &quot;conquered more tribes than Alexander the Great.&quot; Ancient Indian writers indicate that he possibly launched expeditions southward into Rajasthan and as far east down the Ganges River Valley as Pataliputra (Patna) though he failed to retain these conquests.

Large numbers of Menander’s coins have been unearthed, attesting to both the flourishing commerce and longevity of his realm. Menander was also a patron of Buddhism, and his conversations with the Buddhist sage Nagasena are recorded in the important Buddhist work, the &quot;Milinda Panha&quot; (&quot;The Questions of King Milinda&quot;; &quot;panha&quot; meaning &quot;question&quot; in Pali). After his death in 130 BC, he was succeeded by his wife Agathocleia, perhaps the daughter of Agathocles, who ruled as regent for his son Strato I. Buddhist tradition relates that he handed over his kingdom to his son and retired from the world, but Plutarch says that he died in camp while on a military campaign, and that his remains were divided equally between the cities to be enshrined in monuments, probably stupas, across his realm.

==Reign==
Menander was born into a Greek family in a village called Kalasi adjacent to Alexandria of the Caucasus (present day Bagram, Afghanistan), although another source says he was born near Sagala (modern Sialkot in the Punjab, Pakistan). His territories covered Bactria (modern-day Balkh Province) and extended to India (modern-day regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Greater Punjab.

His capital is supposed to have been Sagala, a prosperous city in northern Punjab (believed to be modern Sialkot, Pakistan).



Accounts describe Indo-Greek campaigns to Mathura, Panchala, Saketa, and potentially Pataliputra. The sage Patanjali around 150 BC, describes Menander campaigning as far as Mathura. The Hathigumpha inscription inscribed by Kharavela the King of Kalinga also places the Yavanas, or Indo-Greeks, in Mathura. Kharavela states to have forced the demoralized Yavana army to retreat back to Mathura:

Menander may have campaigned as far as the Shunga capital Pataliputra resulting in a conflict. The religious scripture Yuga Purana, which describes events in the form of a prophecy, states:
Strabo also suggests that Indo-Greek conquests went up to the Shunga capital Pataliputra in northeastern India (today Patna):

The events and results of these campaigns are unknown. Surviving epigraphical inscriptions during this time such as the Hathigumpha inscription states that Kharavela sacked Pataliputra. Furthermore, numismatics from the Mitra dynasty are concurrently placed in Mathura during the time of Menander. Their relationship is unclear, but the Mithra may potentially be vassals.

In the West, Menander seems to have repelled the invasion of the dynasty of Greco-Bactrian usurper Eucratides, and pushed them back as far as the Paropamisadae, thereby consolidating the rule of the Indo-Greek kings in the northwestern part of the Indian Subcontinent.

The &quot;Milinda Panha&quot; gives some glimpses of his military methods:

Generous findings of coins testify to the prosperity and extent of his empire: (with finds as far as Britain) the finds of his coins are the most numerous and the most widespread of all the Indo-Greek kings. Precise dates of his reign, as well as his origin, remain elusive, however. Guesses among historians have been that Menander was either a nephew or a former general of the Greco-Bactrian king Demetrius I, but the two kings are now thought to be separated by at least thirty years. Menander&#x27;s predecessor in Punjab seems to have been the king Apollodotus I.

Menander&#x27;s empire survived him in a fragmented manner until the last Greek king Strato II disappeared around 10 AD.

The 1st-2nd century AD &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; further testifies to the reign of Menander and the influence of the Indo-Greeks in India:
According to Numismatist Joe Cribb, the accounts of Menander’s kingdom stretching as far as Sialkot, is hard to believe, as there is no numismatic evidence of him east of Taxila, even more hard is to believe is stretching even further east as thought earlier by historians based upon Indian references, which most likely are referring to Kushans. However, numerous coins of Menander (and Hellenistic pottery shards) were in the Siranwali hoard found near Sialkot, and further coins of Menander were in the Sonipat hoard from present-day Haryana. Additional corroboration for mentions of Indo-Greek expeditions into the Gangetic Plains may be furnished by the Yavanarajya inscription discovered in Mathura, and discoveries of Menander&#x27;s coins in western Uttar Pradesh including the Pachkhura hoard of coins unearthed near the Yamuna River in Hamirpur district, Uttar Pradesh, and the unearthing of a clay pot filled with coins of preceding kings (Diodotus I, Diodotus II, and Euthydemus I) in Vaishali district, Bihar.

==Menander and Buddhism==

===The &quot;Milinda Panha&quot;===

According to tradition, Menander embraced the Buddhist faith, as described in the &quot;Milinda Panha&quot;, a classical Pali Buddhist text on the discussions between Milinda and the Buddhist sage Nāgasena. He is described as constantly accompanied by an elite guard of 500 Greek (&quot;Yavana&quot;) soldiers, and two of his counsellors are named Demetrius and Antiochus.

In the &quot;Milinda Panha&quot;, Menander is introduced as
Buddhist tradition relates that, following his discussions with Nāgasena, Menander adopted the Buddhist faith:

He then handed over his kingdom to his son and retired from the world:


There is however little besides this testament to indicate that Menander in fact abdicated his throne in favour of his son. Based on numismatic evidence, William Tarn believed that he in fact died, leaving his wife Agathocleia to rule as a regent, until his son Strato could rule properly in his stead. Despite the success of his reign, it is clear that after his death, his &quot;loosely hung&quot; empire splintered into a variety of Indo-Greek successor kingdoms, of various sizes and stability.

His legacy as a Buddhist arhat reached the Greco-Roman world and Plutarch writes:

The above seems to corroborate the claim: 
===Other Indian accounts===

* A 2nd century BC relief from a Buddhist stupa in Bharhut, in eastern Madhya Pradesh (today at the Indian Museum in Calcutta), the Bharhut Yavana, represents a foreign soldier with the curly hair of a Greek and the royal headband with flowing ends of a Greek king, and maybe a depiction of Menander. In his right hand, he holds a branch of ivy, a symbol of Dionysos. Also, parts of his dress, with rows of geometrical folds, are characteristically Hellenistic in style. On his sword appears the Buddhist symbol of the three jewels, or Triratana.
* A Buddhist reliquary found in Bajaur, the Shinkot casket, bears a dedicatory inscription referring to &quot;the 14th day of the month of Kārttika&quot; of a certain year in the reign of &quot;Mahārāja Minadra&quot; (&quot;Great King Menander&quot;):

* According to an ancient Sri Lankan source, the Mahavamsa, Greek monks seem to have been active proselytizers of Buddhism during the time of Menander: the Yona (Greek) Mahadhammarakkhita () is said to have come from &quot;Alasandra&quot; (thought to be Alexandria of the Caucasus, the city founded by Alexander the Great, near today’s Kabul) with 30,000 monks for the foundation ceremony of the Maha Thupa (&quot;Great stupa&quot;) at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka, during the 2nd century BC:

===Buddhist constructions===

A coin of Menander I was found in the second oldest stratum (GSt 2) of the Butkara stupa suggesting a period of additional constructions during the reign of Menander. It is thought that Menander was the builder of the second oldest layer of the Butkara stupa, following its initial construction during the Maurya empire.

These elements tend to indicate the importance of Buddhism within Greek communities in northwestern India, and the prominent role Greek Buddhist monks played in them, probably under the sponsorship of Menander.

==Coinage==

Menander has left behind an immense corpus of silver and bronze coins, more so than any other Indo-Greek king. During his reign, the fusion between Indian and Greek coin standards reached its apogee. The coins feature the legend ( / Kharoshthi: MAHARAJA TRATARASA MENADRASA).
* According to Bopearachchi, his silver coinage begins with a rare series of drachma depicting on the obverse Athena and on the reverse her attribute the owl. The weight and monograms of this series match those of earlier king Antimachus II, indicating that Menander succeeded Antimachus II.
* On the next series, Menander introduces his own portrait, a hitherto unknown custom among Indian rulers. The reverse features his dynastical trademark: the so-called Athena Alkidemos throwing a thunderbolt, an emblem used by many of Menander&#x27;s successors and also the emblem of the Antigonid kings of Macedonia.
* In a further development, Menander changed the legends from circular orientation to the arrangement seen on coin 4 to the right. This modification ensured that the coins could be read without being rotated, and was used without exception by all later Indo-Greek kings.

These alterations were possibly an adaption on Menander&#x27;s part to the Indian coins of the Bactrian Eucratides I, who had conquered the westernmost parts of the Indo-Greek kingdom, and are interpreted by Bopearachchi as an indication that Menander recaptured these western territories after the death of Eucratides.
* Menander also struck very rare Attic standard coinage with monolingual inscriptions (coin 5), which were probably intended for use in Bactria (where they have been found), perhaps thought to demonstrate his victories against the Bactrian kings, as well as Menander&#x27;s own claim to the kingdom.
* There exist bronze coins of Menander featuring a manifold variation of Olympic, Indian, and other symbols. It seems as though Menander introduced a new weight standard for bronzes.
Menander was the first Indo-Greek ruler to introduce the representation of Athena Alkidemos (&quot;Athena, saviour of the people&quot;) on his coins, probably in reference to a similar statue of Athena Alkidemos in Pella, capital of Macedon. This type was subsequently used by most of the later Indo-Greek kings.

==Menander the Just==

A king named Menander with the epithet &quot;Dikaios&quot;, &quot;the Just&quot;, ruled in Punjab after 100 BC. Earlier scholars, such as A. Cunningham and W. W. Tarn, believed there was only one Menander, and assumed that the king had changed his epithet and/or was expelled from his western dominions. A number of coincidences led them to this assumption:
* The portraits are relatively similar, and Menander II usually looks older than Menander I.
* The coins of Menander II feature several Buddhist symbols, which were interpreted as proof of the conversion mentioned in the &quot;Milinda Panha&quot;.
* The epithet &quot;Dikaios&quot; of Menander II was translated into Kharosthi as &quot;Dharmikasa&quot; on the reverse of his coins, which means &quot;Follower of the Dharma&quot; and was interpreted likewise.

However, modern numismatists such as Bopearachchi and R.C. Senior have shown, by differences in coin findings, style, and monograms, that there were two distinct rulers. The second Menander could have been a descendant of the first, and his Buddhist symbols may have been a means of alluding to his ancestor&#x27;s conversion. However, Menander I struck a rare bronze series with a Buddhist wheel (coin 3).

==Menander&#x27;s death==
Plutarch reports that Menander died in camp while on campaign, thereby differing with the version of the Milindapanha. Plutarch gives Menander as an example of benevolent rule, contrasting him with disliked tyrants such as Dionysius, and goes on to explain that his subject towns fought over the honour of his burial, ultimately sharing his ashes among them and placing them in &quot;monuments&quot; (possibly stupas), in a manner reminiscent of the funerals of the Buddha.

Despite his many successes, Menander&#x27;s last years may have been fraught with another civil war, this time against Zoilos I who reigned in Gandhara. This is indicated by the fact that Menander probably overstruck a coin of Zoilos.

The Milinda Panha might give some support to the idea that Menander&#x27;s position was precarious, since it describes him as being somewhat cornered by numerous enemies into a circumscribed territory:

===Theories of Menander&#x27;s successors===
Menander was the last Indo-Greek king mentioned by ancient historians, and developments after his death are therefore difficult to trace.

a) The traditional view, supported by W.W. Tarn and Bopearachchi, is that Menander was succeeded by his queen Agathoclea, who acted as regent to their infant son Strato I until he became an adult and took over the crown. Strato I used the same reverse as Menander I, Athena hurling a thunderbolt, and also the title Soter.

According to this scenario, Agathoclea and Strato I only managed to maintain themselves in the eastern parts of the kingdom, Punjab, and at times Gandhara. Paropamisadae and Pushkalavati were taken over by Zoilos I, perhaps because some of Agathokleia&#x27;s subjects may have been reluctant to accept an infant king with a queen regent.

b) On the other hand, R.C. Senior and other numismatics such as David Bivar have suggested that Strato I ruled several decades after Menander: they point out that Strato&#x27;s and Agathoclea&#x27;s monograms are usually different from Menander&#x27;s, and overstrikes and hoard findings also associate them with later kings.

In this scenario, Menander was briefly succeeded by his son Thrason, of whom a single coin is known. After Thrason was murdered, competing kings such as Zoilos I or Lysias may have taken over Menander&#x27;s kingdom. Menander&#x27;s dynasty was thus dethroned and did not return to power until later, though his relative Nicias may have ruled a small principality in the Kabul valley.

For the family tree that illustrates these relationships, see Family tree of the Indo-Greek kings (see the Menanderid dynasty).

==Legacy==

===Buddhism===
After the reign of Menander I, Strato I and several subsequent Indo-Greek rulers, such as Amyntas, Nicias, Peucolaus, Hermaeus, and Hippostratus, depicted themselves or their Greek deities forming with the right hand a symbolic gesture identical to the Buddhist vitarka mudra (thumb and index joined together, with other fingers extended), which in Buddhism signifies the transmission of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching. At the same time, right after the death of Menander, several Indo-Greek rulers also started to adopt on their coins the Pali title of &quot;Dharmikasa&quot;, meaning &quot;follower of the Dharma&quot; (the title of the great Indian Buddhist king Ashoka was &quot;Dharmaraja&quot; &quot;King of the Dharma&quot;). This usage was adopted by Strato I, Zoilos I, Heliocles II, Theophilus, Peucolaus and Archebius.

Altogether, the conversion of Menander to Buddhism suggested by the Milinda Panha seems to have triggered the use of Buddhist symbolism in one form or another on the coinage of close to half of the kings who succeeded him. Especially, all the kings after Menander who are recorded to have ruled in Gandhara (apart from the little-known Demetrius III) display Buddhist symbolism in one form or another.

Both because of his conversion and because of his unequaled territorial expansion, Menander may have contributed to the expansion of Buddhism in Central Asia. Although the spread of Buddhism to Central Asia and Northern Asia is usually associated with the Kushans, a century or two later, there is a possibility that it may have been introduced in those areas from Gandhara &quot;even earlier, during the time of Demetrius and Menander&quot; (Puri, &quot;Buddhism in Central Asia&quot;).
A frieze in Sanchi executed during or soon after the reign of Menander depicts Buddhist devotees in Greek attire. The men are depicted with short curly hair, often held together with a headband of the type commonly seen on Greek coins. The clothing too is Greek, complete with tunics, capes and sandals. The musical instruments are also quite characteristic, such as the double flute called aulos. Also visible are Carnyx-like horns. They are all celebrating at the entrance of the stupa. These men would probably be nearby Indo-Greeks from northwest India visiting the Stupa.

===Representation of the Buddha===

The anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha is absent from Indo-Greek coinage, suggesting that the Indo-Greek kings may have respected the Indian an-iconic rule for depictions of the Buddha, limiting themselves to symbolic representation only. Consistently with this perspective, the actual depiction of the Buddha would be a later phenomenon, usually dated to the 1st century, emerging from the sponsorship of the syncretic Kushan Empire and executed by Greek, and, later, Indian and possibly Roman artists. Datation of Greco-Buddhist statues is generally uncertain, but they are at least firmly established from the 1st century.

Another possibility is that just as the Indo-Greeks routinely represented philosophers in statues (but certainly not on coins) in Antiquity, the Indo-Greek may have initiated anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha in statuary only, possibly as soon as the 2nd-1st century BC, as advocated by Foucher and suggested by Chinese murals depicting Emperor Wu of Han worshipping Buddha statues brought from Central Asia in 120 BC (&quot;See picture&quot;). An Indo-Chinese tradition also explains that Nagasena, also known as Menander&#x27;s Buddhist teacher, created in 43 BC in the city of Pataliputra a statue of the Buddha, the Emerald Buddha, which was later brought to Thailand.

Stylistically, Indo-Greek coins generally display a very high level of Hellenistic artistic realism, which declined drastically around 50 BC with the invasions of the Indo-Scythians, Yuezhi and Indo-Parthians. The first known statues of the Buddha are also very realistic and Hellenistic in style and are more consistent with the pre-50 BC artistic level seen on coins.

This would tend to suggest that the first statues were created between 130 BC (death of Menander) and 50 BC, precisely at the time when Buddhist symbolism appeared on Indo-Greek coinage. From that time, Menander and his successors may have been the key propagators of Buddhist ideas and representations: &quot;the spread of Gandhari Buddhism may have been stimulated by Menander&#x27;s royal patronage, as may have the development and spread of Gandharan sculpture, which seems to have accompanied it&quot; (Mcevilley, &quot;The Shape of Ancient Thought&quot;, p. 378).

===Education===
The Milind College in the city of Aurangabad, India, is named after King Menander I using the Pali translation of his name, &quot;Milind&quot;. The college was founded in part by Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, an Indian leader of the Dalit Buddhist movement and writer to the constitution of the Republic of India.

===Geography===
In Classical Antiquity, from at least the 1st century, the &quot;Menander Mons&quot;, or &quot;Mountains of Menander&quot;, came to designate the mountain chain at the extreme east of the Indian subcontinent, today&#x27;s Naga Hills and Arakan, as indicated in the Ptolemy world map of the 1st century geographer Ptolemy.

<text>The Thai lunar calendar (, , , literally, &quot;Specific days according to lunar norms&quot;), or [[Tai peoples|Tai]] calendar, is a lunisolar Buddhist calendar. It is used for calculating lunar-regulated holy days. Based on the SuriyaYatra, with likely influence from the traditional Hindu &quot;Surya Siddhanta&quot;, it has its own unique structure that does not require the Surya Siddhanta to calculate. Lunisolar calendars combine lunar and solar calendars for a nominal year of 12 months. An extra day or an extra 30-day month is intercalated at irregular intervals.

==Legal versus religious calendar==
The Thai solar calendar (, , ), Thailand&#x27;s version of the Gregorian calendar, replaced the &quot;patithin chanthrakhati&quot; in AD 1888 / 2431 BE for legal and commercial purposes. In both calendars, the four principal lunar phases determine Buddhist Uposathas, obligatory holy days for observant Buddhists. Significant days also include feast days.

Note that the Thai and the Chinese lunar calendars do not directly correspond. Thai Chinese likewise observe their Uposatha and traditional Chinese holidays according to solar terms, two of which correspond to one lunar phase. These also move with respect to the solar calendar, and so it is common for Thai calendars to incorporate both Thai and Chinese lunar calendar-based events.

Mundane astrology also figures prominently in Thai culture, so modern Thai birth certificates include lunar calendar dates and the appropriate Thai Zodiacal animal year-name for Thai Hora (, ). The Thai Zodiac is similar to the Chinese, though the Dragon is replaced by the Naga (งูใหญ่), and in Northern Thailand the Pig is occasionally replaced with an Elephant.

==Years==
To keep the years in sync with the seasons, Thai lunar years may add a day to the 7th month or repeat the 8th month. Therefore, years may have one of three lengths – 354, 355 or 384 days – yet retain a nominal length of twelve months.

*The 354-day-long years consist of 12 &quot;normal months&quot;, and such a year is called a &quot;normal-month year&quot; (, , ).
*The 355-day-long years add an extra day to the normally 29-day-long 7th month; such a year is called an &quot;extra-day year&quot; (, , ).
*The 384-day-long years repeat the 30-day-long 8th month, thus keeping the month count at 12. Nevertheless, a year of 384 days is called an &quot;extra-month year&quot; (, , ).

===New year===
The Thai lunar calendar does not mark the beginning of a new year when it starts a new 1-to-12 count, which occurs most frequently in December.
The Thai solar calendar determines a person&#x27;s legal age and the dates of secular holidays, including the civil new year and the three days of the traditional Thai New Year, which begin the next Twelve-year animal cycle. Should the holidays fall on a weekend, it also accommodates these as well as some of the principal lunar festivals with a compensatory day off (, ).

=== Twelve-year animal cycle ===

13 April of the solar calendar occasions the beginning of the traditional Thai New Year (Songkran) and is the day that a year assumes the name of the next animal in the twelve-year animal cycle; Thai Chinese communities may observe the name-change earlier in accordance with the Chinese New Year.

The Thai names of the months were borrowed from Khmer, which were in turn borrowed from Archaic Vietnamese.

== Months ==
In the modern Thai calendar, months (, , , meaning &quot;month&quot; or &quot;Lunation&quot;) are defined by lunar cycles. Successive months (or lunations) are numbered from 1 to 12 within the Thai year. As in other Buddhist calendars, these months have names that derive from Sanskrit, but for the most part are only known by Thai astrologers.

Two successive lunations take slightly more than 59 days. The Thai lunar calendar approximates this interval with &quot;normal-month&quot; pairs (, ) that are alternately 29 and 30 days long. 29-day &quot;hollow months&quot; (, , ) are odd-numbered (, , ); 30-day &quot;full months&quot; (, , ) are even-numbered (, , ).

To keep the beginning of the month in sync with the new moon, from time to time either the normally &quot;hollow&quot; Month 7 takes an extra day, or an extra &quot;full&quot; Month 8 follows a normal &quot;full&quot; Month 8.

Months 1 and 2 are named in archaic alternate numbers, with the remainder being named in modern numbers.

=== Months 1 – 6 ===
Month 1, &quot;duean ai&quot; (, ), begins the cycle of counting the months anew, most frequently in December, but does not signify the beginning of a new year. &quot;Ai&quot;, an archaic word in Thai but not in other dialects, means &quot;first&quot;. An odd-numbered hollow month, it is 29 days long.

Month 2, &quot;duean yi&quot;, (, , from archaic ญี่ meaning &quot;2&quot;) is an even-numbered full month.

Months 3–6, &quot;duean 3–6&quot;, use the modern reading of Thai numerals, as do all remaining months. Months 3–6, alternate between 29-day hollow months and 30-day full months.

=== Month 7 and athikawan ===
Month 7, &quot;duean 7&quot;, a hollow month is normally 29 days long in years of 354 days, but adds an extra day ( ) when required for 355-day-long years (, ).

===Month 8 ===
The eighth month, &quot;duean 8&quot;, is a 30-day full month.

=== Month 8/8 &quot;athikamat&quot; ===
Athikamat (, )) is the extra month needed for a 384-day-long &quot;pi athikamat&quot; (extra-month year; , ). Month 8 repeats as เดือน ๘/๘ or Month 8/8, variously read as &quot;duean paet thab paet&quot; () or &quot;duean paet lang&quot; ()

===Months 9 – 12 ===
Months 9–12, &quot;duean 9–12&quot;, complete the lunar cycle.

===Month divisions===
Months divide into two periods designated by whether they are waxing or waning:
*Waxing : &quot;khang khuen&quot; (), the period from new moon to full moon, is always 15 days long.
*Waning : &quot;khang raem&quot; (), the period from full moon to new moon, which is 14 days long in hollow months, except when Month 7 adds an extra day, and 15 days long in full months.

== Weeks ==

A week is called &quot;Sapda/Sappada&quot; (, ). The term is defined by the Royal Institute Dictionary (RID) as a 7-day period beginning on Sunday and ending Saturday. When referring to lunations, however, it is the 7-, 8- or (rarely) 9-day interval between quartile lunar phases; that is, from one &quot;wan phra&quot; () to the next.

==Days==
While solar-calendar weekdays have names, lunar-calendar days number sequentially from 1 to 14 or 15 in two segments depending on whether the moon is waxing or waning. For example, &quot;raem 15 kham duean 12 &quot; means &quot;Waning of the 15th Night of the 12th Lunar Month&quot;.

&quot;Kham &quot;, evening, is considered to be the evening of the common day that begins and ends at midnight, rather than of a day that begins and ends at dusk. Past practice may have been different.

==Named lunar days==
*&quot;Wan Phra&quot; , Buddhist holy days
**&quot;Wan Thamma Sawana&quot; Buddhist Uposatha regularly fall on:
***&quot;Khuen 8&quot; first-quarter moon
***&quot;Khuen 15&quot; full moon; also called &quot;wan phen&quot; day [of] full [moon]. However, &quot;Wan Deuan Phen&quot; , the actual day of the full moon and khuen 15 kham do not always fall on the same day.
***&quot;Raem 8&quot; third-quarter moon
***&quot;Raem 14 (15)&quot; the last day of the lunar month; also called &quot;wan dap&quot; day [moon is] quenched, [or goes] out.
*&quot;Wan wai phra chan&quot; , called &quot;Day [of] Respect [for] the Holy Moon&quot;, is the actual day the Harvest moon becomes full. It occurs on &quot;khuen 14 (15) kham duean 10&quot; (Waxing 14 (15) Evening, Month 10.)

==Holidays regulated by the moon==

Uposatha, colloquially called , are the New, First-quarter, Full, and Third-quarter Moon-days. These are not normally days off (), except for butcher, barber, and beautician shops that observe the Eight Precepts. Annual holidays and seasonal festivals collectively are called .

Festivals or fairs are called ; these may be further styled as &quot;traditional&quot; and as , &quot;rite&quot; or &quot;ceremony&quot;. The table shows the principal ones governed by the moon in yellow.

Work holidays prescribed by the government are called ; those regulated by the moon are red.

Weekends are normally days off; if a holiday normally observed by a day off falls on a weekend, the following Monday is a compensatory day off .

Notes:
: † The Chinese New Year uses different methods of determining intercalary months, so this festival sometimes occurs a month earlier or later.
: ‡ Month 8/8 in years with the extra month.

==Thai year vocabulary==
Thai orthography spells most native words phonetically, though there is no definitive system for
transcription into Roman letters. Here, native Thai words are immediately followed by a vocabulary entry in this pattern:
:&quot;Phonetic&quot; Thai (Thai phonetic respelling, if different) [Comment] definition; variant definitions.
Example:
:&quot;Thai&quot; ไทย (ไท) [Archaic] free, frank; Thai race, language, alphabet; citizen of Thailand.

Sanskrit loan words follow different rules [the way English grammatical rules vary for words of Greek and Latin origin (&#x27;ph-&#x27; in &#x27;phonetic&#x27; being pronounced /f/, for example.)] Entered below in order of first appearance, these vocabulary entries are in this pattern:

<text>Albrecht Benjamin Ritschl (25 March 182220 March 1889) was a German Protestant theologian.

Starting in 1852, Ritschl lectured on systematic theology. According to this system, faith was understood to be irreducible to other experiences, beyond the scope of reason. Faith, he said, came not from facts but from value judgments. Jesus&#x27; divinity, he argued, was best understood as expressing &quot;revelational-value&quot; of Christ for the community that trusts him as God. He held the Christ&#x27;s message to be committed to a community.

==Biography==
Ritschl was born in Berlin. His father, Georg Karl Benjamin Ritschl (1783–1858), became in 1810 a pastor at the church of St Mary in Berlin, and from 1827 to 1854 was general superintendent and evangelical bishop of Pomerania. Albrecht Ritschl studied at Bonn, Halle, Heidelberg and Tübingen. At Halle he came under Hegelian influences through the teaching of Julius Schaller and Johann Erdmann. In 1845 he became a follower of the Tübingen school, and in his work &quot;Das Evangelium Marcions und das kanonische Evangelium des Lukas&quot;, published in 1846 and in which he argued that the Gospel of Luke was based on the apocryphal Gospel of Marcion, he appears as a disciple of the Hegelian New Testament scholar Ferdinand Baur. This did not last long with him, however, for the second edition (1857) of his most important work, on the origin of the Old Catholic Church (&quot;Die Entstehung der alt-kathol. Kirche&quot;), shows considerable divergence from the first edition (1850), and reveals an entire emancipation from Baur&#x27;s method.
Ritschl was professor of theology at Bonn (extraordinarius 1852; ordinarius 1859) and Göttingen (1864; &quot;Consistorialrath&quot; also in 1874), his addresses on religion delivered at the latter university showing the impression made upon his mind by his enthusiastic studies of Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Schleiermacher. Finally, in 1864, Ritschl came the influence of Hermann Lotze. He wrote a large work on the Christian doctrine of justification and atonement, &quot;Die Christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung&quot;, published during the years 1870–1874, and in 1882–1886 a history of pietism (&quot;Die Geschichte des Pietismus&quot;). His system of theology is contained in the former. He died at Göttingen in 1889. His son, Otto Ritschl, was also a theologian.

==Theology==
Ritschl claimed to carry on the work of Luther and Schleiermacher, especially in ridding faith of the tyranny of scholastic philosophy. His system shows the influence of Kant&#x27;s destructive criticism of the claims of Pure Reason, recognition of the value of morally conditioned knowledge, and doctrine of the kingdom of ends; of Schleiermacher&#x27;s historical treatment of Christianity, regulative use of the idea of religious fellowship, emphasis on the importance of religious feeling; and of Lotze&#x27;s theory of knowledge and treatment of personality. He attempted to demonstrate that Kant&#x27;s epistemology was compatible with Lutheranism. Ritschl&#x27;s work made a profound impression on German thought and gave a new confidence to German theology, while at the same time it provoked a storm of hostile criticism. In spite of this resistance the Ritschlian &quot;school&quot; grew with remarkable rapidity, with followers dominating German theological faculties in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This is perhaps mainly due to the bold religious positivism with which he assumes that spiritual experience is real and that faith has not only a legitimate but even a paramount claim to provide the highest interpretation of the world. The life of trust in God is a fact, not so much to be explained as to explain everything else. Ritschl&#x27;s standpoint is not that of the individual subject. The objective ground on which he bases his system is the religious experience of the Christian community. The &quot;immediate object of theological knowledge is the faith of the community,&quot; and from this positive religious datum theology constructs a &quot;total view of the world and human life.&quot; Thus the essence of Ritschl&#x27;s work is systematic theology. Nor does he painfully work up to his master-category, for it is given in the knowledge of Jesus revealed to the community. That God is love and that the purpose of his love is the moral organization of humanity in the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; – this idea, with its immense range of application – is applied in Ritschl&#x27;s initial datum.

From this vantage-ground Ritschl criticizes the use of Aristotelianism and speculative philosophy in scholastic and Protestant theology. He holds that such philosophy is too shallow for theology. Hegelianism attempts to squeeze all life into the categories of logic: Aristotelianism deals with &quot;things in general&quot; and ignores the radical distinction between nature and spirit. Neither Hegelianism nor Aristotelianism is &quot;vital&quot; enough to sound the depths of religious life. Neither conceives God &quot;as correlative to human trust&quot; (cf. &quot;Theologie und Metaphysik&quot;). But Ritschl&#x27;s recoil carries him so far that he is left alone with merely &quot;practical&quot; experience. &quot;Faith&quot; knows God in his active relation to the kingdom,&quot; but not at all as &quot;self-existent&quot;.

His limitation of theological knowledge to the bounds of human need might, if logically pressed, run perilously near phenomenalism; and his epistemology (&quot;we only know things in their activities&quot;) does not cover this weakness. In seeking ultimate reality in the circle of &quot;active conscious sensation&quot;, he rules out all &quot;metaphysic&quot;. Indeed, much that is part of normal Christian faith – e.g. the Eternity of the Son – is passed over as beyond the range of his method. Ritschl&#x27;s theory of &quot;value-judgments&quot; (&quot;Werthurtheile&quot;) illustrates this form of agnosticism. Religious judgments of value determine objects according to their bearing on our moral and spiritual welfare. They imply a lively sense of radical human need. This sort of knowledge stands quite apart from that produced by &quot;theoretic&quot; and &quot;disinterested&quot; judgments. The former moves in a world of &quot;values&quot;, and judges things as they are related to our &quot;fundamental self-feeling.&quot; The latter moves in a world of cause and effect. (N.B. Ritschl appears to confine Metaphysic to the category of Causality.)
The theory as formulated has such grave ambiguities, that his theology, which, as we have seen, is wholly based on uncompromising religious realism, has actually been charged with individualistic subjectivism. If Ritschl had clearly shown that judgments of value enfold and transform other types of knowledge, just as the &quot;spiritual man&quot; includes and transfigures but does not annihilate the &quot;natural man&quot;, then within the compass of this spiritually conditioned knowledge all other knowledge would be seen to have a function and a home. The theory of value-judgments is part too of his ultra-practical tendency: both &quot;metaphysic&quot; and &quot;mysticism&quot; are ruthlessly condemned. Faith-knowledge appears to be wrenched from its bearings and suspended in mid-ocean. Perhaps if he had lived to see the progress of will-psychology he might have welcomed the hope of a more spiritual philosophy.

==Illustrative examples==
A few instances will illustrate Ritschl&#x27;s positive systematic theology. The conception of God as Father is given to the community in Revelation. He must be regarded in His active relationship to the &quot;kingdom&quot;, as spiritual personality revealed in spiritual purposiveness. His &quot;Love&quot; is His will as directed towards the realization of His purpose in the kingdom. His &quot;Righteousness&quot; is His fidelity to this purpose. With God as First Cause or &quot;Moral Legislator&quot; theology has no concern; nor is it interested in the speculative problems indicated by the traditional doctrine of the Trinity. Natural theology has no value save where it leans on faith. Again, Christ has for the religious life of the community the unique value of Founder and Redeemer. He is the perfect Revelation of God and the Exemplar of true religion. His work in founding the kingdom was a personal vocation, the spirit of which He communicates to believers, &quot;thus, as exalted king&quot;, sustaining the life of His Kingdom. His Resurrection is a necessary part of Christian belief (G Ecke, pp. 198–99). &quot;Divinity&quot; is a predicate applied by faith to Jesus in His founding and redeeming activity. We note here that though Ritschl gives Jesus a unique and unapproachable position in His active relation to the kingdom, he declines to rise above this relative teaching. The &quot;Two Nature&quot; problem and the eternal relation of the Son to the Father have no bearing on experience, and therefore stand outside the range of theology.

Once more, in the doctrine of sin and redemption, the governing idea is God&#x27;s fatherly purpose for His family. Sin is the contradiction of that purpose, and guilt is alienation from the family. Redemption, justification, regeneration, adoption, forgiveness, reconciliation all mean the same thing-the restoration of the broken family relationship. All depends on the Mediation of Christ, who maintained the filial relationship even to His death, and communicates it to the brotherhood of believers. Everything is defined by the idea of the family. The whole apparatus of &quot;forensic&quot; ideas (law, punishment, satisfaction, etc.) is summarily rejected as foreign to God&#x27;s purpose of love, Ritschl is so faithful to the standpoint of the religious community, that he has nothing definite to say on many important questions, such as the relation of God to non-Christians. His school, in which Wilhelm Herrmann, Julius Kaftan and Adolf Harnack are the chief names, diverges from his teaching in many directions; e.g. Kaftan appreciates the mystical side of religion, Harnack&#x27;s criticism is very different from Ritschl&#x27;s exegesis. They are united on the value of faith knowledge as opposed to &quot;metaphysic&quot;.

<doc id="180802" wikidata="Q1130398" url="?curid=180802" title="Thai solar calendar">
<text>The Thai solar calendar (, , &quot;solar calendar&quot;) was adopted by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) in 1888 CE as the Siamese version of the Gregorian calendar, replacing the Thai lunar calendar as the legal Thai calendar (though the latter is still also used, especially for traditional and religious events). Years are now counted in the Buddhist Era (B.E.): (lit. &#x27;era of the Shaka Buddha&#x27;) which is 543 years ahead of the Gregorian calendar.

==Years==

The Siamese generally used two calendars, a &quot;sacred&quot; and a &quot;popular&quot; ( in the classical sense). The vulgar or minor era (, &quot;chula sakarat&quot;) was thought to have been instituted when the worship of Gautama was first introduced, and corresponds to the traditional Burmese calendar (abbreviated ME or BE, the latter not to be confused with the abbreviation for the Buddhist Era, which is the sacred era.)

=== Rattanakosin Era ===
King Chulalongkorn decreed a change in vulgar reckoning to the &quot;Rattanakosin Era&quot; (, &quot;Rattanakosin Sok&quot; abbreviated ร.ศ. and R.S.) in 1889 CE. The epoch (reference date) for Year 1 was 6 April 1782 with the accession of Rama I, the foundation of the Chakri dynasty, and the founding of Bangkok (Rattanakosin) as capital. To convert years in R.S. to the Common Era, add 1781 for dates from 6 April to December, and 1782 for dates from January to 5 April.

===Buddhist Era===
In Thailand the sacred, or Buddhist Era, is reckoned to have an epochal year 0 from 11 March 543 BC, believed to be the date of the death of Gautama Buddha. King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) changed year counting to this Buddhist Era (abbreviated BE) and moved the start of the year back to 1 April in 2455 BE, 1912 CE. As there is no longer any reference to a vulgar or popular era, the Common Era may be presumed to have taken the place of the former.

===New year===
New Year, the time at which a new calendar year begins and the calendar&#x27;s year count is incremented, originally coincided with the date calculated for Songkran, when the Sun transits the constellation of Aries, the first astrological sign in the Zodiac as reckoned by sidereal astrology: thus the year commenced on 11 April 1822. As previously noted, Rama VI moved the start of the year back to 1 April in 2455 BE, 1912 CE, so that 130 R.S. only lasted for 356 days from 11 April 1911 to 31 March 1912.

On 6 September 1940, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram decreed 1 January 1941 as the start of the year 2484 BE, so year 2483 BE had only nine months running from 1 April to 31 December 1940. To convert dates from 1 January to 31 March prior to that year, the number to add or subtract is 542; otherwise, it is 543. Example:

Today, both the Common Era New Year&#x27;s Day (1 January) and the traditional Thai New Year (, &quot;Songkran&quot;) celebrations (13–15 April) are public holidays in Thailand. In the traditional Thai calendar, the change to the next Chinese zodiacal animal occurs at Songkran (now fixed at 13 April.) For Thai Chinese communities in Thailand, however, the Chinese calendar determines the day that a Chinese New Year begins, and assumes the name of the next animal in the twelve-year animal cycle.

Names of the months derive from Hindu astrology names for the signs of the zodiac. Thirty-day-month names end in &quot;-ayon&quot; (), from Sanskrit root &quot;āyana&quot; : the arrival of; 31-day-month names end in -akhom (), from Sanskrit āgama (cognate to English &quot;come&quot;) that also means the arrival of.

February&#x27;s name ends in -&quot;phan&quot; (), from Sanskrit &quot;bandha&quot; : &quot;fettered&quot; or &quot;bound&quot;. The day added to February in a solar leap year is &quot;Athikasuratin&quot; (, respelled to aid pronunciation () from Sanskrit adhika : additional; sura : move).

==Days==

==Problems==
Using Buddhist era could easily cause confusion between itself and Anno Domini in the historical context. For example, Anno Domini 2025, and Buddhist year 2025 (which corresponds to AD ). Two-digit year numbering could cause even more confusion.

Another problem is the counting of the Buddhist era, which has changed several times in the past, including the inclusion of year 0, and the change of New Year&#x27;s Day from April to January in 1941, has caused confusion in historical context as well. For example, many Thai people regard the establishment of the Ayutthaya Kingdom to be in 1350, which is direct conversion from Buddhist era 1893, while the actual date is 1351.

In computer programming, using the Buddhist era has sometimes caused the computer programs to void the license immediately, as the input values of the Buddhist era would exceed the expiration date for the program. Some users report that dates appear in future dates, due to the input data being the Buddhist era, while the computer is designed to accept Anno Domini.

<doc id="180803" wikidata="Q1790380" url="?curid=180803" title="The Krypton Factor">
<text>The Krypton Factor is a British game show produced by Granada Television for broadcast on ITV. The show originally ran from 7 September 1977 to 20 November 1995 and was hosted by Gordon Burns.

Contestants across the United Kingdom and Ireland competed in rounds that tested their physical stamina and mental attributes. The show&#x27;s title refers to Superman&#x27;s home planet, Krypton, the title perceiving that the contestants had strong superhuman &quot;powers&quot; for participating in the challenges they were set. From 1986 onwards, the contestants all had their corresponding colours: red, green, yellow, or blue. The points contestants earned through the game were referred to as their &quot;Krypton Factor&quot;, e.g. &quot;The winner, with a Krypton Factor of 46, is the technical specialist from Birmingham, Caroline White&quot;. The 1987 series won the prestigious Premios Ondas – Spanish Television Award for Entertainment.

The show was revived for two series aired in 2009 and 2010, presented by Ben Shephard.

==History==
===Original series===
The show&#x27;s first series was shown on Wednesdays, presented by Gordon Burns and ran for eleven weeks, consisting of eight heats, two semi-finals and the final. It was then on Fridays for two years before arriving on Mondays in 1980, where it would be a staple of Monday evening schedules until its 18th and final series in 1995. In the first few series, there were no groups and eight heats, the winner of each advancing to a semi-final. The top two of each semi-final qualified for the Grand Final.

From 1981 to 1985, each series had twelve heats, from which each winner, along with the top four runners-up, progressed to the four semi-finals, the winners of which competed in the Grand Final. In 1986 and 1987, the series was divided into four groups (A, B, C, and D). Each group consisted of three heats, with the winner of each heat and the highest-scoring runner-up of the heats within a group making it to the group final. The winner of each group final would qualify for the grand final. From 1988 to 1995, the series had 13 episodes and only three groups (A, B, and C). The highest-scoring runner-up from the group finals would then go to the Grand Final.

In 2009 and 2010, each series had seven heats and the winners of which, in addition to the highest runner-up of the heats, would qualify for the two semi-finals, the winners of which, in addition to the top two overall runners-up, advanced to the Grand Final. The overall winner of the Grand Final would receive a bronze trophy and would traditionally be titled &quot;Superperson of the Year&quot;. Unusually and possibly uniquely for the time, until 1993, the series had no advert break in the middle even though it was on ITV in a primetime 7.00 pm slot. This explains why some of the elements (most notably, the time for the quiz) were shortened in later series.

In the 1991 series, for two weeks in a row, contestants Tony Hetherington and Paul Evans won all of the first five rounds in their heats, scoring 50 points; in addition, Hetherington set a record of 62 points. They later met in the same Group Final, where Evans won, and Hetherington qualified as the Best-Scoring Runner-up and went on to win the Grand Final.

In 1995, the show was heavily revamped, including the addition of co-host Penny Smith. In that series, the intelligence round was dropped, the first round being physical ability, with the rules in each round changing dramatically, except for general knowledge. The show&#x27;s second half was a &quot;super round&quot;, which included a 3D maze, code cracking and a race up Mount Krypton, with accumulated points being exchanged for equipment to assist the contestants with the challenge. While some viewers liked the changes, others felt that scrapping the Intelligence round was a sign of dumbing down and that dramatically changing the format was a mistake.

===Revival===
Since its cancellation in 1995, there were persistent rumours of a revival on the BBC. In April 2005, it was widely reported that the BBC would advance with a revival. However, the source of this story turned out to be a misinterpretation of comments by Wayne Garvie, head of BBC&#x27;s Entertainment Group (and previously the last producer on &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;), naming it as the next &quot;TV gem&quot; that &quot;should&quot; (rather than would) be revived.

On 24 September 2008, Broadcast reported that ITV was expected to commission a new series within weeks. As part of their wider Business Brains campaign, The Sage Group funded the show&#x27;s return, and in November, it was confirmed that Ben Shephard would host it. The first episode was shown on Thursday, 1 January 2009, at 7.30 pm and ran for ten consecutive weeks. The new series is based on the original five-round format of the show, with every round being &quot;brought bang up-to-date&quot; and featuring &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; technology. However, The Guardian described the rounds as having &quot;irritating bleeping noises and confusing graphics&quot;. The series was recorded at Granada Studios in Manchester from 7–10 December 2008. It was filmed in London for the 2010 series, which used a four-round format, as the Intelligence round was dropped again.

Critical reception to the revival was poor, with UKGameshows stating, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to think of anything they&#x27;ve done differently this time where the change is an improvement&quot; The Guardian ultimately describes it as &quot;like getting back together with an ex (drunkenly, on New Year&#x27;s Eve). And then sobering up quickly and realising why you split up in the first place.&quot; The launch episode of the revival was watched by only half as many viewers as a repeat of &quot;Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death&quot;.

==Rounds==

The rounds were usually in the same order as below during the original series, except for the 1995 series. However, there were only five rounds in the earlier series, as Response had yet to be introduced; this round was also dropped for the 2009 revival.

In all rounds except the final round, 10 points were awarded to the winner, then 6 (8 in early series), 4 and 2 to the remaining contestants. In the event of a tie, all tied players would receive the score for the higher place – in an extreme case, if three contestants tied with the highest score, they would all receive 10 points, with just 2 points for the unlucky fourth contestant. In the Mental Agility and Observation rounds, the contestant who answered faster would sometimes be awarded the higher place; in other cases, a tiebreaker question was used. On rare occasions, an observation round would have the players answer a five-part question, such as &quot;Name the five continuity errors in the film clip,&quot; players would receive 2 points for each correct answer.

From 1986 to 1991, each round was introduced by the distinctive K logo, which would morph into a symbol for the round. A similar version of this was used in the 2009 revival.

===Personality (1977)===
This round only occurred in the first series, where it was third. In it, the contestants were sequestered, where they had to write a 30-second script on a subject given to them, like a destination brochure, a letter of complaint, etc., which they had one chance to perform. The performances were filmed, and a focus group in twenty cities and towns across Great Britain voted on the best effort.

===Mental agility (1978–1995, 2009–2010)===
First played in the second series, this often took the form of a memory test (though other versions would require mental computation of time and date differences or to add up a sequence of numbers and return the number which, when added to that sum, gave a pre-determined answer). The contestants frequently had to memorise a sequence and then answer progressively more complicated questions. For instance, if the sequence to be memorised was a series of coloured blocks, the questions might start as &quot;What is the colour of the third block from the left?&quot; and progress to &quot;What is the colour of the block two to the left of the block to the right of the green block?&quot;. Other forms of memory tests might require contestants to remember a phrase or proverb and answer a series of questions about it (e.g. &quot;What was the fifth letter of the fourth word?&quot; or &quot;Spell the last word backwards&quot;).

Initially, the round consisted of a &quot;knock-out&quot; format, where contestants were asked increasingly difficult questions and eliminated for wrong answers. If two or more players were eliminated on the same turn, ties were broken based on who had answered most of their questions correctly. Later, the contestants were shown 9 images along with a statement read to them by Charles Foster, and the contestants had to pick which 4 images were correct; they scored 2 points for each correctly identified image, with a maximum of 10 points for all four. In the semi-finals and final, this would change to showing two sequences in turn and asking each player a 3-point question about each sequence. A third sequence was then shown to all players at once, and one toss-up question, worth four points, was open to all players on the buzzer. If a player jumped in with the incorrect answer, that player was not penalized, and any other player could jump in. In 1985, in the heats each player was asked three questions worth 3, 3 and 4 points respectively. Then, until 1987, the Mental Agility round alternated between the knock-out format (without tiebreaks) and a 45 or 50-second &quot;speed test&quot; where each player had to come up with as many correct answers as possible before time expired and could pass on any of them. Only if they answered incorrectly would they be informed of it, possibly to discourage guesswork.

From 1988 onwards, the Mental Agility round consisted entirely of 40-second speed tests, and from 1991 to 1993, ties were broken by the time each player took to achieve their score. In the 1995 series, a set of four images (such as numbers, letters, or dates) were shown to the players, who were all read a statement about one or two of the images, and the contestants had to touch the correct image(s) on their screen. The monitors were placed on a rotating turntable to increase the difficulty of being the first to answer. This round lasted two minutes, with the images changing every eight questions. Only the first player to provide a correct answer would score for that answer, with answering time used to break ties.

This round was conducted initially with all contestants wearing headphones to prevent the other participants from hearing their competitors&#x27; answers. However, in the 1991 series, each contestant came on individually to perform their test in front of the audience before sitting down in their respective places behind them; no headphones were worn. By the end of the round, all 4 contestants would be seated. In the 2009 revival, the Mental Agility round followed the 1988 format, only using the tiebreaker rules when there was a tie for first place. Contestants individually completed this round in an isolation booth referred to as &quot;The Kube&quot;, and their heart rates were also measured while they took the test. Each contestant&#x27;s time was increased from 40 to 45 seconds for the 2010 version, and the tiebreak rule from 1991 returned.

===Response (1986–1995)===
New producer Geoff Moore introduced the Response round for the 1986 and 1987 series. In 1987, the Response round in the initial heats was a combination of a race between the contestants using double-odometer bicycles and a video wall which would display random numbers of coloured blocks; the contestants were required to press one of four coloured buttons corresponding to the highest number of blocks of any one colour being displayed. This alternated with a test in which the contestants had to walk a balance beam to the first challenge - placing coloured wooden blocks into frames on either side of them, swinging from side to side (this was known as the Fleischmann Flexibility Tests). They then had to run across a balance beam linked to the Minnesota Manual Dexterity Test, where they had to take a shape and place it into a corresponding space. After a final balance beam, they jump onto their respective mat to finish the race. The 1986 series consisted of the contestants competing in twos to perform first the Minnesota Manual Dexterity test (moving differently coloured cylinders from one side to the other), then running over to perform the Fleischmann Flexibility Test and then the final test, which involved hitting the relevant button whenever a colour flashed up on the screen (only one colour at a time in this case).

The Group and Grand Finals in the 1986 and 1987 series consisted of each player taking turns on a flight simulator and being marked by an actual flight instructor. From 1988 onwards, the Response round consisted entirely of flight simulator tests. In 1988, the contestants had to land a BAe 146 in the heats, a Harrier jump jet in the Group Finals and a Sea King on an aircraft carrier in the Grand Final (recorded at Culdrose Navy base in Helston, Cornwall). In 1989, the heats used three different simulators. The first heat in each group required the contestants to land Concorde, the second required the contestants to land a Red Arrow, and the third required them to land a Boeing 737. The group finals required the contestants to land the Sea King on an aircraft carrier. The Grand Final of the 1989 series saw the contestants use a Space Shuttle simulator in California.

In 1990, the contestants landed Concorde in the heats, the Sea King on an aircraft carrier in the group final, and in the Grand Final, the contestants were in the Sea King again, but this time they used the simulator in a rescue mission. They started from an oil rig (carrying an injured passenger) and had to take off from the oil rig and land on the aircraft carrier. From 1991 to 1993, the heats and group finals were the same; Boeing 737 was in the heats, and the Sea King was in the group finals. The 1991 Grand Final involved the contestants using a Nimrod simulator in a refuelling mission involving a Hercules aircraft. The 1992 and 1993 grand finals required the contestants to land a real plane. In 1995, all tests involved the Red Arrows flight simulator, and the simulator scored each player automatically, with losses based on their overall flight time before either crashing or losing contact with the lead plane for too long. The 2009 revival of the show did not include this round.

===Observation (1977–1995, 2009–2010)===
This round often involved watching a specially made clip being broadcast then, with an edited-together clip from a feature film or a television programme that was out in that particular year. In the earliest series, contestants were each asked three two-point questions (the first was an either-or question, the second was visual, and the third pertained to dialogue) on the clip in turn, followed by an identity parade where they were shown nine similar-looking actors, one of whom appeared in the clip. Each player who identified the correct actor earned four points. This was later changed so that each contestant was asked two two-point questions in turn, followed by four one-point toss-up questions open to all players with no penalty for a wrong answer, and the identity parade was worth two points.

From 1986 to 1988, contestants were shown a clip twice and asked to spot five differences between two similar clips (six differences in 1988), and in 1986 and 1987, each player earned two points for each correctly identified difference. Many of the sequences recorded for the 1988 series were written by and featured Andrew O&#x27;Connor. From the 1989 and 1990 series, contestants were invited to spot six deliberate continuity errors (five in the 1990 series) contained in one clip. In some of his earliest television appearances, Steve Coogan starred in many of the sequences featured in the 1989 series. From 1991 to 1993, contestants answered six multiple-choice questions (five in the 1993 series) relating to the clip (e.g. &quot;What did he say when he entered the room?&quot; or &quot;What was on the table?&quot;), and the time used to provide the correct answers was used to break ties.

Sometimes, original serials specially produced for the show were used, such as 1990&#x27;s Sam Smith: Private Detective (starring Gwyneth Strong), which saw the female detective investigating rather silly cases (which often featured her young chubby nephew, Wallace). Some guests in then Sam Smith stories included Derek Griffiths, Matthew Kelly and Keith Chegwin, who all appeared in the series&#x27; final instalment. The 1991 series featured the saga Where is Don Day? Starring Tony Robinson and Michelle Collins, it is about a bank manager whose dull life is suddenly changed when he accidentally becomes involved in a robbery from his bank. 1992 saw Dead Ringer, starring Tony Slattery, a thriller about a man suffering from amnesia trying to discover who he is whilst being hunted down by a hitman named Preston, played by Roger Lloyd-Pack. In 1993, the round featured Roy Barraclough and Annabel Giles in a collection of investigative police stories, with Barraclough playing a retired police detective.

In 1995, short computer-animated segments commissioned from Bournemouth University&#x27;s Department of Media Production were used for the test, and only five questions were asked. As with the Mental Agility round, answers were provided via touch screen monitors and placed on a rotating turntable, with Penny walking around the turntable and asking the questions.

In the 2009 revival, each contestant was asked one individual question, and then four further questions were asked on the buzzer. If a player answers incorrectly, one more player can buzz in, but there are no penalties for a wrong answer. Contestants are ranked on how many correct answers, and if two or more players are tied, they each receive the same number of points. The exception is when there is a tie for the most correct answers. In this case, an extra question is asked to break the tie. In the 2010 version, each player is asked two questions in turn, and the contestants are awarded two points for a correct answer; however, like General Knowledge, one point is deducted for a wrong answer, and the next player jumps in and has a chance to steal. The point totals for this round are then used to rank each player.

===Physical ability (1977–1995, 2009–2010)===
In the original series, this pre-recorded segment involved the contestants racing to complete an army assault course at Holcombe Moor in Bury. This round typically included 20 obstacles, including vertical and flat cargo nets, rope swings, water jumps, Burma rope bridges, and a slide into the water. Gordon Burns stated in some episodes that the contestants trained for the assault course in the physical ability round for up to five weeks in advance. In the first series, the assault course was done as an athletics track type, with all of the contestants starting at the same time from different starting points, handicapped by age and sex. The second series featured the more recognised assault course but didn&#x27;t feature the aerial slide until the early 1980s; instead, the contestants would jump from a high platform onto a mat below to end their run of the course.

In this round, female contestants were allowed a head start over their male competitors, and in the early series, contestants were given staggered starts to the assault course; following practice sessions with army personnel, the contestant of the weakest physical ability would set off first. The physical ability criteria were established from a simple formula derived from the age and gender of the contestant. In 1980, this typically meant two seconds per year of age difference and a 40-second advantage for female competitors. In the 1980 semi-final, the youngest competitor, Ted Stockton (a taxi driver, aged 25), started 56 seconds after the only female semi-finalist, who was 33. The age-based calculation was abolished in 1988. In 1995, the Physical Ability round was moved to the start of the show as the first round, and all contestants started simultaneously and were ranked according to how far ahead each had come of an individual &quot;par time&quot; based on age and sex.

The 1990 series saw many of the metal obstacles on the course replaced by wooden substitutes, including a wooden S-bend frame contestants had to descend. In the first episode of the 1978 series, one female contestant (Diane Lindsay) injured her arm while practising for the long drop at the end of the course, but later ran and completed the course and was found to have broken her arm in the practice run. Another female contestant (Judith Stafford) in 1989 broke her ankle after landing badly on one of the obstacles (near the end of the course) but managed to complete the rest of the course and finish in third place. Another female contestant (this time in 1987), Sue Dandy, completed the course despite having torn ligaments in her leg while coming out of a narrow, upward-sloping tunnel. (In 1982, a male contestant cut his forehead on this obstacle.) A male contestant (Paul Evans) in 1991 who fell from the top of the A-frame net managed to not only complete the course but win the round despite suffering from shock due to his fall. Another male contestant (Jackie Harte), this time in 1992, broke the safety rules when he went down the aerial slide without placing his feet in the water. Another male contestant (Jon Johnson), this time in 1993, fell off the Burma rope bridge towards the end of the course, but luckily, he landed in the net below and was able to finish in second place. For at least some series (around 1986–88), the fastest man and fastest woman on the assault course received a special trophy. Winners include Barbara Murray and Stuart Worthington (1986), Marian Chanter and Ted Daszkiewicz (1987), and Elizabeth Hayward and Alan Robbie (1988).

The 2009 revival used a new assault course, which only had room for two contestants at a time. The time it took each contestant to complete the course was recorded and revealed when the central part of the show was recorded. Female contestants had 45 seconds deducted from their time. The assault course was again changed for the 2010 version, with all four contestants competing simultaneously.

===Intelligence (1977–1993, 2009)===
A two or three-dimensional puzzle where shapes had to be put together to fill a rectangular grid or make a bigger shape was the basis for this round. Dr Gerry Wickham of the University of Manchester&#x27;s School of Mathematics devised most of these. As the contestants performed the task, presenter Gordon Burns provided commentary to viewers at home on the contestants&#x27; progress and advice on how to solve the puzzle. The contestants need to see beforehand what the completed puzzle should look like. In the first series, this round was first, and tests varied, often taking the form of what would later be Mental Agility tests.

Suppose a contestant is injured and unable to participate physically in this round (as happened to Diane Lindsay in the first episode of the 1978 series). In that case, an assistant may be brought in to complete the task under the contestant&#x27;s instructions. Still, the assistant may refrain from speaking back or interfering with the task.

It is reputed that some of the intelligence tests featured took contestants hours to solve, with edited highlights of their performance in the round shown on the programme. At least one contestant was moved to tears by the difficulty of the puzzles. In 1990, Gordon Burns told contestants that over the years, some of the tests had taken 15 or 20 minutes to complete, but that in one programme in the 1980 series, when the competitors&#x27; tables had been placed too close together for this round, two competitors accidentally picked up pieces from each other&#x27;s table, making it impossible to complete the puzzle. Nearly an hour had passed as they vainly attempted to finish before the problem was realised. This round was eliminated from the 1995 series.

In the early series, as well as the 2009 revival, a time limit was placed for completion, and after the time ran out, the contestants who still needed to finish were ranked according to the progress they had made on the puzzle. This round was removed (again) in the 2010 series.

===General knowledge (1977–1995, 2009–2010)===
A quick-fire question round with a varied time limit (which depended on the year), and only one player could answer each question. For most of the run, this final round was conducted in darkness using a side shot of the four contestants lit in profile – when a contestant buzzed in, the remaining three players&#x27; spotlights would go out. A feature of this round was that, as each question was answered, the next question contained either the answer to the last question, a word from the last answer, or a word that sounded like it. Initially, players were asked as many toss-up questions as time allowed, with two points added for a correct answer and two points deducted for an incorrect response or none at all (+/- 1 in the first series).

Later, the round was in two stages: the first stage had the contestants answering three general knowledge questions, each from the same set of categories with 2 points for each correct answer, then it was on to stage 2, which was the quick-fire stage, which lasted 90 seconds, with each question worth +/- 1. Starting in 1986, the round consisted solely of a quick-fire round. Until 1987, the round lasted 100 seconds, each question worth +/- 1. In 1988, the values changed to +/- 2 points, and the time was reduced to 90 seconds (100 in 1989 and 75 in 1993 and 1995). In 2009, the round lasted 70 seconds, and a correct answer was worth two points, while an incorrect answer cost one point. In the 2010 series, time was increased from 70 seconds to 90 seconds. The player with the highest Krypton Factor won the game, and in the event of a tie, the tied players were asked further questions until the tie was broken.

===Super Round (1995)===
In 1995, the game was decided by a &quot;Super Round,&quot; a race encompassing all previous rounds&#x27; abilities. At the start of the round, players were shown five coloured circles, each with a letter or number, and the players had to memorize the sequence before making a parachute jump down 50 feet to the floor. They then entered the Kryptic Rings, a three-dimensional maze of interlocking rings with numbered and lettered junctions. Following and correctly interpreting the sequence (following the circles clockwise, starting with the circle of their colour) would lead each player to their correct exit. Each exit was marked with a letter, which they would memorize on their way to the next part of the race, the Laser Matrix, preceded by a computer where each player had to log in by hitting the letter critically matching their exit. Each player then had to type in four words with a common thread. However, each key corresponds to a different letter according to a code (such as each key giving the preceding letter).

After cracking the code and typing in the four words, each player had to cross a corridor of shifting laser beams, where breaking each beam resulted in a seven-second penalty. Once out, the players entered the Response Revolve, a rotating cylinder where each had to collect six batons of their colour from their holds; however, each baton could only be removed when a light by the baton flashed, and all lights flashed according to a sequence. Once all six batons were out and placed in the player&#x27;s pedestal, each player had to run to the Krypton Mountain, where they first had to build a four-piece ladder, which they ascended before making a vertical climb up the Krypton Mountain, completing the race by grabbing a letter K of their colour at the top of the Krypton Mountain.

The players started at the same time and place and used their points from the first five rounds to buy advantages, such as directional arrows in the Rings, completed words at the computer (in Heat 2 of Group C, an easier path through the Laser Matrix), batons already removed from the Response Revolve, or ladder pieces already built. The value of each advantage varied with the heats, group finals, and finals. The player who won the Super Round won the game, and completion time was used to determine who held the wild card spot.

The Super Round was also notable for a few incidents regarding cheating; in Group B, two contestants (both wearing yellow) were disqualified for unknowingly breaking the rules of the Super Round. Heat 1 contestant Simon Evans was disqualified as he had prematurely proceeded from the Laser Matrix computer having mistakenly thought he completed all four words when he hadn&#x27;t (he produced a &quot;j&quot; instead of an &quot;h&quot; in the third word; Penny told him about his disqualification at the top of the Krypton Mountain) and in Heat 2 the following week, contestant Alison Riley was disqualified as she had forcibly pulled out batons from the Response Revolve when their adjacent lights weren&#x27;t flashing and unlike Evans, she was edited out of the remainder of the round after she had begun her ascent on the ladder and a replay was shown of her illegal move. As a result of their actions, Simon Evans and Alison Riley were the only contestants in &quot;Krypton Factor&quot; history to be disqualified.

==Young Krypton==

A spin-off series, Young Krypton, was produced for children and was presented by Ross King. The series was based on a similar structure to the adult version but with simpler intelligence tasks and a shorter obstacle course (located at The American Adventure Theme Park near Nottingham, owned by the Granada Group at the time) in place of the Physical Ability round.

The 1988 series, which had only five rounds (Mental Agility, Response, Observation, Physical Ability and General Knowledge, with Intelligence in place of Response in the Group and Grand Finals), followed the tournament format of the regular series, while the 1989 series, which only ran 8 episodes, consisted of five heats, two semi-finals, and the Grand Final. The five heat winners plus the three highest runners-up advanced to the semis, the winners of which qualified for the Grand Final, along with the top two runners-up from both matches.

At the end of both series, Gordon Burns appeared to present the trophy to the winner. Also, in the 1988 Grand Final, Ross King presented a special trophy to Phillip Westwick, who completed the adventure course in the fastest time.

==Special episodes==
&quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; had several Champion of Champions episodes; the first edition aired on 22 December 1980, featuring the winners of the first four series, which was won by Philip Bradley (1980) and Ian Botham presented the trophy. This was followed by another Champion of Champions edition of the show on 22 July 1985, featuring the winners from the previous four years: John McAllister (1981), John Webley (1982), Chris Topham (1983) and Paul Smith (1984), with McAllister winning the game and trophy. The next Champion of Champions episode aired on 27 March 1989, featuring four-star contestants: Marian Chanter and Alison Heath (1987), David Lee (1988) and Andrew Gillam (1985). Alison Heath won this match.

On 28 March 1988, an International special was broadcast in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand as part of Australia&#x27;s bi-centennial celebrations. Made in the UK and presented by Gordon Burns, the episode featured Marian Chanter and Alison Heath, winner and runner-up respectively of the UK &quot;Krypton Factor&quot; Grand Final 1987 and John Cargill and Christopher Connolly, winner and runner-up respectively of the Australia &amp; New Zealand &quot;Krypton Factor&quot; 1987 final. Alison Heath won the International title, and Fatima Whitbread presented the trophy.

==Theme tune==
Four theme tunes for the programme were used during the original series of &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;. The first two theme tunes (the first from 1977 to 1982, and the second from 1983 to 1985) were written by Mike Moran. Art of Noise performed the theme tune between 1986 and 1993, perhaps the programme&#x27;s best-known theme. It was written by band members Anne Dudley and J. J. Jeczalik. The exact version of this theme tune varied in some episodes/series. For example, the drum beats in the music in some episodes/series were more emphasised, as was the synthesizer melody, but generally, it remained the same. Mistakenly referred to as &quot;Beat Box&quot;, the track which appeared on their debut album &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Art of Noise?&quot; it is, in fact, an original composition and was reworked as &quot;Crusoe&quot; in 1987. A version of the Art of Noise theme, first heard in 1986, was released on the compilation album &quot;Influence&quot; in 2010. For the 1995 series, the theme tune was a reworked version of the 1986–93 theme tune but was performed by Dudley.

The music used during the scoring at the end of the Response round in 1988 was &quot;Forgotten Town&quot; by The Christians. In the 1989 series, &quot;Left to My Own Devices&quot; by the Pet Shop Boys was used.

Generally, during the opening title sequence, the contestants were introduced by former Granada Television continuity announcer Charles Foster.

The music to the 2009 revival was created by Paul Farrer. In their review, UKGameshows asked &quot;can anyone actually remember the new theme &quot;tune&quot;?&quot;.

==Merchandise and commercial representations==
&quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; had a number of clothing merchandise, including a pair of black trainers bearing the Krypton K on the sides and the tongue. A &quot;Krypton Factor&quot; sports bag, mug and teatowel were also produced. Although not mentioned on the air, all the contestants were given a Sports bag and some clothing with the &quot;Krypton Factor&quot; logo as gifts for appearing on the programme.

A computer game version of &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; was published by TV Games and released in 1987 for the home computers of the era. A &quot;Krypton Factor&quot; Quizbook was published in 1989.

ITV released &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; interactive DVD board game via their website in 2010, and then again in 2011. The DVD game is hosted by Ben Shephard.

Adrenalin in North Yorkshire markets itself as the home of the obstacle course from the TV series, which offers paying public a chance to take on the Assault course.

Demon Wheelers have developed a team-building event based around the rounds from &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; TV series and incorporating an inflatable assault course.

There have also been several &quot;Krypton Factor&quot; tie-in books published.

==Other versions==
&quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; was later exported to the United States. Two short-lived United States versions of &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; aired. In 1981, Dick Clark hosted a 5-week summer series on ABC. In 1990, Willie Aames hosted a syndicated version for children. In 2000, a version hosted by Pat O&#x27;Brien and produced by Fox TV was never shown to the public. In 2015, another version in production for Syfy was also never shown to the public.

The New Zealand version of &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; ran from 1987 to 1991 on TVNZ and TV2 and was hosted by veteran presenter Dougal Stevenson. There was no Response round in the New Zealand version, and the video clips used for the Observation test were taken from the United Kingdom version. The Physical Ability test was done at Burnham Military Camp, just south of Christchurch. The first season in 1987 consisted of a challenge between Australian and New Zealand contestants, with all of the series hosted in New Zealand and aired on ABC in Australia during that time. The winners of the 1987 series competed against the winners of the 1987 series in the United Kingdom. Reruns of &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; were screened on TVNZ 6.

A German version of the show called &quot;Krypton Faktor&quot;, presented by Jörg Draeger aired in 1991, with 13 episodes shown on Sat.1 before the show was cancelled.

==In popular culture==
The series was parodied in darkly comic form on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;The Armstrong and Miller Show&quot; as &quot;The Critical Factor&quot;. Here, the contestant coming last in each event is brutally killed in the background by two figures dressed in black. Plus, the three male contestants are all &#x27;consultant civil engineers&#x27;, a reference to the number of contestants in the actual show that came from &#x27;white collar&#x27; middle-class backgrounds, with the winner, Susan Small, referred to as a &#x27;housewife&#x27;.

A 1990 sketch in series 2 of &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot; depicts a scene in which a representative of an unnamed organisation (Stephen Fry) holds a clandestine meeting in an underground car park with a gruff, vaguely criminal type with an extensive record of adventures (Hugh Laurie). The &quot;impossible&quot; task that the organisation wants this man to attempt to watch an entire episode of &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;, a feat which, according to the organisation&#x27;s representative, has never been done before.

Even after the axing of the 2009 revival (due to lack of funding), there were plenty of references to &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;, especially as one of the prizes on &quot;The All-New Blockbusters&quot; (hosted by Simon Mayo). Ironically, in the same year, the &quot;1&quot; and the &quot;2&quot; in the logo for the London 2012 Olympics had accidentally referred to the show, as fans pointed out its similarities to the very first &quot;Krypton Factor&quot; &quot;K&quot; from the early 1980s.

A deleted scene from the ITV variety series &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Alright on the Night&quot; made it to many compilations; it showed Ben Shephard biting his tongue after he accidentally said &quot;two points for second&quot; instead of fourth. It was subsequently referenced on the game show &quot;Tipping Point&quot; (which Shephard also presented) as a question.

The series was also referenced in the ITV documentary &quot;Come On Down: The Game Show Story&quot;, with current &quot;Krypton Factor&quot; presenter Ben Shephard and former presenter Gordon Burns both hinting that it was a mistake on ITV&#x27;s part to end the programme.

<text>The Green Monster is a popular nickname for the left field wall at Fenway Park, home to the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball. The wall is from home plate and is a popular target for right-handed hitters.

==Overview==


The wall was part of the original ballpark construction of 1912, along Fenway&#x27;s north side facing Lansdowne Street. It is made of wood and was covered in tin and concrete in 1934. It was then covered with hard plastic in 1976. A manual scoreboard is set into the wall, which has been there, in one form or another, at least as far back as 1914 (see photo at right). Despite the name, the Green Monster was not painted green until 1947; before that, it was covered with advertisements. The &quot;Monster&quot; designation is relatively new. For most of its history it was simply called &quot;The Wall&quot;.

The Green Monster is the highest among the walls in current Major League Baseball fields, and it is the second highest among all professional baseball fields (including minor leagues). As of 2007 it was surpassed by the left field wall of WellSpan Park in York, Pennsylvania, which is approximately taller.

Ballparks occupied by professional baseball teams have often featured high fences to hide the field from external viewers, particularly behind open areas of the outfield where bleacher seating is low-lying or non-existent. The wall might also reduce the number of &quot;cheap&quot; home runs due to the barrier&#x27;s relatively tall height above the playing surface. Fenway&#x27;s wall serves both purposes. Past ballparks of Fenway&#x27;s era or even later which featured high fences in-play included Baker Bowl, Washington Park, Ebbets Field, League Park, Griffith Stadium, Shibe Park, and more recently, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Fenway is the last of the exceptionally high-walled major league ballparks. Relatively high walls in modern ballparks have been constructed for their novelty rather than by necessity, as Fenway&#x27;s wall had been.

The Green Monster is famous for preventing home runs on many line drives that would clear the walls of other ballparks. A side effect of this is to increase the prevalence of doubles, since this is the most common result when the ball is hit off the wall (often referred to as a &quot;wallball double&quot;). In fact, the MLB record for doubles in a season was set by Red Sox player Earl Webb, who hit 67 doubles in 1931. This record has rarely been challenged. Some left fielders, predominantly those with vast Fenway experience, have become adept at fielding caroms off the wall to throw runners out at second base or hold the batter to a single. Compared with other current major league parks, the wall&#x27;s placement creates a comparatively shallow left field; the wall falls approximately from the plate along the left-field foul line. With this short distance, many deep fly balls that could be caught by the fielder in a deeper park rebound off the wall for base hits. And while the wall turns many would-be line-drive homers into doubles it also allows some high yet shallow fly balls to clear the field of play for a home run.

During 2001 and 2002, the Green Monster&#x27;s height record was temporarily beaten by the center field wall at Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio. During the construction of Great American Ball Park, located right next to Riverfront Stadium, a large section of seats was removed from the center field area to make room and a black wall was erected as a temporary batter&#x27;s eye. The entire wall was in play. This new wall was often called &quot;The Black Monster&quot;. When Riverfront Stadium was demolished in 2002, the Green Monster reclaimed the record. In honor of the famed wall, the Red Sox mascot is a furry green monster named Wally the Green Monster, joined in 2016 by his younger sister Tessie.

==Features==

===Duffy&#x27;s Cliff===
From 1912 to 1933, a mound formed an incline in front of the Green Monster, extending from the left-field foul pole to the center field flag pole. This earthwork formed a &quot;terrace&quot;, a common feature of ballparks of the day (where a dirt-surfaced warning track would normally be today), whose purpose was to make up the difference in grade between street level and field level, as with Cincinnati&#x27;s Crosley Field. It also served to double as a seating area to handle overflow crowds, another common practice of that era.

As a result of the terrace, when overflow crowds were not seated atop it, a left fielder in Fenway Park had to play the territory running uphill. Boston&#x27;s first star left fielder, Duffy Lewis, mastered the skill so well that the area became known as &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Cliff&quot;. In contrast, rotund outfielder Bob Fothergill, known by the indelicate nicknames of &quot;Fats&quot; or &quot;Fatty&quot;, reportedly once chased a ball up the terrace, slipped and fell, and rolled downhill.

In 1934, Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey arranged to flatten the ground in left field so that Duffy&#x27;s Cliff no longer existed, and it became part of the lore of Fenway Park.

===Scoreboard===
Long after the much-higher location manual scoreboard from &quot;c.&quot;1914 existed (as seen in the 1914 photo), the placement of the modern &quot;ground-level&quot; manual scoreboard occurred in 1934. It forms the lower half of the Green Monster and is still updated by hand from behind the wall throughout the game. The American League scores are also updated from behind the wall. The National League scores need to be updated from the front of the wall between innings. There is also a board which shows the current American League East standings. There are 127 slots in the wall and a team of three score keepers move around , plates to represent the score. Yellow numbers are used to represent in-inning scores and white numbers are used to represent final inning tallies. The numbers of the current pitchers weigh and measure .

Carlton Fisk&#x27;s &quot;body English&quot; when he hit his game-winning home run in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, &quot;waving&quot; the ball fair, was captured on a TV camera stationed in the scoreboard.

===Morse Code===
The Morse Code that appears from top to bottom in the white lines of the American League scoreboard are the initials of former owners Thomas A. Yawkey and Jean R. Yawkey.

===Right field===
Fenway&#x27;s left-field distortion is offset by the odd shape and generous size of right field, which is (although its actual distance has been disputed over the years) along the foul line (almost the same as in left), but at its deepest. The bullpen was added along the right field wall in 1940 to shorten the distance for left-handed slugger Ted Williams&#x27; home runs to clear the fence. For years afterward, the bullpens were known as &quot;Williamsburg&quot;.

===Green Monster seating===

In 1936, the Red Sox installed a net above the Monster in order to protect the storefronts on adjoining Lansdowne Street from home run balls. The net remained until the 2002–03 offseason, when the team&#x27;s new ownership constructed a new seating section atop the wall to accommodate 274 fans. Wildly popular, these &quot;Monster seats&quot; were part of a larger expansion plan for Fenway Park seating. The Red Sox later added a smaller seating section in 2005, dubbed the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Nest,&quot; located between the main seating section and the center field scoreboard.

===The ladder===
Comprising yet another quirk, a ladder is attached to the Green Monster, extending from near the upper-left portion of the scoreboard, above ground, to the top of the wall. Previously, members of the grounds crew would use the ladder to retrieve home run balls from the netting hung above the wall. After the net was removed for the addition of the Monster seats, the ladder ceased to have any real function, yet it remains in place as a historic relic.

The placement of the ladder is noteworthy given the fact that it is in fair territory; it is the only such ladder in the major leagues. On many occasions, a batted ball has struck the ladder during game play, at least twice leading to an inside-the-park home run. During a 1950s game, Red Sox outfielders Ted Williams and Jimmy Piersall both tracked a fly ball in left center, but the ball struck the ladder and caromed into center field, giving batter Jim Lemon enough time to round the bases. Later, in 1963, the slow-footed Dick Stuart hit a high fly that ricocheted first off the ladder, and then the head of outfielder Vic Davalillo, before rolling far enough away to allow Stuart to score.

One common myth perpetuated is that if a ball strikes the ladder and then bounces over the wall or out of play, the batter will be awarded a ground-rule triple. There is no such rule in the ground rules at Fenway, nor in any major league ballpark.

===Advertisements===
After the wall was painted green in 1947, advertisements did not appear on the wall until 1999, when the All-Star Game at Fenway was being promoted. Various ads have appeared above the scoreboard since then, such as the Jimmy Fund, W.B. Mason, and Granite City Electric. The Coke Bottles on the left light tower were a target for power-hitters when they were placed in 1997. These 3D advertisements were taken down before the 2008 season, when an LED sign was built above the new left-field upper deck seats. As a lead up to his 500th career home run, Manny Ramirez&#x27;s home run count was tallied on the bottom of the light tower. Ads beside the manual scoreboard were added when the scoreboard was expanded. Above the manual scoreboard, where a Jimmy Fund advertisement had remained for many years, the logo for Foxwoods Resort Casino is now a prominent aspect of Fenway Park. Outside of Fenway in Kenmore Square, but able to be seen in the view above the left-field wall, is the Boston Citgo sign.

<doc id="180810" wikidata="Q271396" url="?curid=180810" title="Ælla of Deira">
<text>Ælla or Ælle is the first known king of the Anglian kingdom of Deira, which he ruled from around 560 until his death in 588.

==Biography==
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that Ælla became king in 560. Anachronistically, the name of his kingdom is given as Northumbria, but the region was actually split between Deira and Bernicia at the time. Ælla&#x27;s kingdom is identified by Bede as Deira - the use of Northumbria could be based on a tradition whereby the most powerful Anglian king in the region would claim that title. Ælla was almost certainly a pagan - when Pope Gregory the Great encountered two pale-skinned English boys (Deirans) at a slave market in Rome he is said to have remarked that they were &quot;not Angles, but angels, if they were Christian&quot;. (&quot;Non Angli, sed angeli, si forent Christiani.&quot;) and upon learning that the king of Deira was Ælla he said &quot;Alleluia should be sung in that land&quot;.

There is some confusion regarding the time and manner of Ælla&#x27;s death. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; reports that he &quot;passed away&quot; in 588, although a later source expands and says that he was killed by Æthelfrith, son of Æthelric, the former king of Bernicia. This account is contradicted by Bede, who says that Ælla was still king in 597 when Augustine of Canterbury came to Britain. In either case, after Ælla&#x27;s death his family were forced to flee as the rulers of Bernicia seized control of the kingdom.

==Family==
The &quot;Chronicle&quot; gives Ælla&#x27;s father as Yffe, and gives a genealogy going back to Woden. Two children of Ælla are identifiable from historical records - Edwin and Acha. Edwin went into exile upon his father&#x27;s death but eventually became king of both Deira and Bernicia. Acha similarly went into exile, and she eventually married Æthelfrith of Bernicia. Ælla had at least one brother, Ælfric, and his successor as king, Æthelric, is variously identified as another brother or a son.

<doc id="180812" wikidata="Q2060501" url="?curid=180812" title="Signy Island">
<text>Signy Island is a small subantarctic island in the South Orkney Islands of Antarctica. It was named by the Norwegian whaler Petter Sørlle (1884–1933) after his wife, Signy Therese.

The island is about long and wide and rises to above sea level. Much of it is permanently covered with ice. The average temperature range is to about in winter (i.e. in July). The extremes extend to . The island is separated from Coronation Island to the north by Normanna Strait, and from Moe Island to the southwest by Fyr Channel.

On Signy Island, the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) maintains the Signy Research Station, a scientific station for research in biology. The base was opened on 18 March 1947, on the site of an earlier whaling station that had existed there in the 1920s. The station was staffed year-round until 1996; since that year it has been occupied only from November to April. It houses 10 people.

== Geography ==
A number of locations on the island have been charted and individually named by various Antarctic expeditions. The first survey was conducted in 1912 by Norwegian whaling captain Petter Sørlle. It was subsequently visited and charted by Discovery Investigations (DI) personnel in 1927 and 1933. Finally, in 1947, the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) charted the island. The charts produced by these surveys account for many of the names of the island&#x27;s features. Others were provided later by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC).

=== West coast ===
The northernmost point of Signy Island is descriptively named North Point, first charted in 1933 by DI personnel. To the southwest, off the coast, are the ice-free Spindrift Rocks, approximately high. They were surveyed and named in 1947 by FIDS. The name is descriptive of the spindrift, or sea spray, which forms over these rocks during westerly gales. South of North Point is Williams Haven, a cove with a large sea cave in the cliff on the north side of the cove. UK-APC named the cove after David D. Wynn-Williams, BAS microbiologist. The south entrance of Williams Haven is marked by Richard Point, named for Kenneth J. Richard, BAS technician.

Deschampsia Point is a point on the northwest side of Signy Island, 0.3 nautical miles (0.6 km) northeast of the Spindrift Rocks. It was descriptively named by UK-APC in 1991 after the Antarctic hair grass &quot;Deschampsia antarctica&quot;, which grows on the slopes near the point.

To the south, Lovegrove Point, named by UK-APC for Ian W. Lovegrove, marks the north entrance of Express Cove, a small cove approximately midway down the west coast of the island. Express Cove has a very indented shoreline with numerous offshore islands and rocks. It was roughly charted in 1933 by DI personnel and named for the American schooner &quot;Express&quot;, which visited the South Orkney Islands in 1880. Foca Point marks the south side of the entrance to Express Cove. It was named for the whale catcher &quot;Foca&quot;, belonging to the Compañía Argentina de Pesca. Both were surveyed in 1947 by FIDS and named by UK-APC. Foca Point also marks the north side of Foca Cove, named in association with the point.

The next significant feature is Thulla Point, an ice-free point lying 1 nautical mile (1.9 km) northeast of Jebsen Point. It was charted in 1933 by DI personnel, roughly surveyed in 1947 by FIDS, and named by UK-APC in 1954 for the Norwegian steamship &quot;Thulla&quot;. Thulla Cove, named in association with the point, is located to the south of it.

Inland to the southeast of the point and cove are several lakes, all named by UK-APC. Amos Lake, named for Stephen C. Amos, British Antarctic Survey limnologist, is closest to the shore. Northeast of Amos Lake is Spirogyra Lake, named for the algal genus &quot;Spirogyra&quot;, which grows abundantly in the lake in summer. To the east is Light Lake, named after BAS limnologist Jeremy J. Light. Tranquil Lake, a cirque lake fed by meltwater, named by UK-APC for its sheltered position, lies further inland between Amos Lake and the Snow Hills.

Port Jebsen indents the coast towards the south end of the island immediately north of Jebsen Point. It was charted in 1912 by Petter Sorlle, a Norwegian whaling captain, who named Jebsen Point, for which the cove is named. Also associated are the Jebsen Rocks, a chain of rocks which extend in an east–west direction, lying 0.5 nautical miles north of Jebsen Point.

South of Jebsen Point is Cummings Cove, surveyed by DI personnel in 1933 and FIDS personnel in 1947. It was named by UK-APC for FIDS radio operator E. T. Cummings. BAS maintains a scientific hut at Cummings Cove, visited regularly by BAS personnel from Signy Station. It has accommodations for 2 people, with food and fuel for 2 person-months. Bothy Lake, a small lake at the cove&#x27;s head, was named by UK-APC for this hut, or &quot;bothy&quot;. Twisted Lake, northeast of Cummings Cove, was named by UK-APC for its irregular shoreline. Porteous Point, charted in 1933 by DI personnel, marks the south entrance point of Cummings Cove.

South of Cummings Cove is Hydrurga Cove, named by UK-APC after the leopard seals, &quot;Hydrurga leptonyx&quot;, that commonly frequent the cove.

=== East coast ===
The first prominent feature on the east coast is Stygian Cove, named by FIDS because it is so overshadowed by the cliffs of Robin Peak that a sense of stygian gloom is felt. Immediately to the east is Berry Head, named by DI personnel, which divides Stygian Cove from Tern Cove. The entrance of Tern Cove is blocked by submerged rocks. The cove contains three small islands, and an area near the head dries at low water. It was named by FIDS for the colony of Antarctic terns on the southernmost island in the cove. inland to the south of Berry Head is The Wallows, a low-lying area sheltered by low ridges with a small freshwater pond in the center. It was named by FIDS because moulting elephant seals wallow here in the summer.

To the south of that is Rootes Point, named by UK-APC after David M. Rootes of the BAS, which marks the north entrance of Starfish Cove.
Starfish Cove was roughly surveyed in 1933 by DI personnel and named by FIDS because of the large number of starfish in the cove. About off the mouth of the cove is a small submerged rock called Powell Rock, first charted by Captain Sorlle and named after his whale catcher &quot;Powell&quot;.

South of Starfish Cove is Borge Bay, a large, irregularly-shaped bay that dominates the east side of Signy Island, delineated by Balin Point to the north and Berntsen Point to the south.

 south of Borge Bay is Paal Harbour. The name first appears on a map by captain Sorlle. The harbor and its constituent features were first surveyed in 1933 by DI personnel and resurveyed in 1947 by FIDS. Observation Bluff, high, forms the north side of Paal Harbor. It was named by FIDS because they made daily observations from it. The bluff comes to a point called Polynesia Point, named by UK-APC after the factory ship &quot;Polynesia.&quot; Pinder Gully, named by UK-APC for meteorologist Ronald Pinder, runs into the sea from the bluff. On the west side of the harbor is Rusty Bluff, a prominent cliff rising to a rounded summit, named for its color and a rusted iron post found on the summit by FIDS. Ice-free Rethval Point, named by UK-APC after the Rethval Whaling Company of Oslo, the first company to start whaling in the South Orkney Islands, forms the south side of the entrance to Paal Harbour.

To the south sits Caloplaca Cove, named by UK-APC after the abundant orange lichens of the genus &quot;Caloplaca&quot;, which encrust the sea cliffs around the cove. The south entrance of the cove is marked by Pantomime Point, on Gourlay Peninsula.

Gourlay Peninsula is an irregularly-shaped ice-free peninsula, which is wide at its base and widens to , forming the southeastern extremity of Signy Island. The seaward end of the peninsula divides into three arms. It was surveyed in 1933 by DI personnel, and resurveyed in 1947 by FIDS. Pantomime Point is the northernmost of the three points, and Pageant Point is the central and highest of the three points. Both were named by FIDS for behavior observed in the penguin rookeries on the peninsula. The cove between Pantomime and Pageant Points is named Filer Haven, named by UK-APC for John Filer, a British Antarctic Survey biologist who fell to his death from the cliffs here in 1961. The third point is Gourlay Point, named by DI personnel after engineer Ronald George Gourlay; the peninsula as a whole was named by UK-APC for the point.

=== South coast ===
Moyes Point is a point on the southwest part of Signy Island, forming the east side of the southeast entrance to Fyr Channel. First charted in 1933 by DI personnel, it was surveyed by FIDS in 1956-58. In 1959 it was named by UK-APC after William Moyes, British government representative at Signy Island in 1912–13.

To the east, the southernmost point of the island is Pandemonium Point, named by FIDS because of the ceaseless noise from the penguin rookeries on the west side of the ridge close north of the point. Clowes Bay is a bay wide, entered between the Oliphant Islands and Confusion Point on Confusion Island, along the south side of Signy Island. It was charted in 1933 by DI personnel who named it for Archibald J. Clowes, English oceanographer. East of Clowes Bay is Lenton Point, named in 1954 by UK-APC for radio operator Ralph A. Lenton of FIDS. Lenton Point marks the west side of Fur Seal Cove, which sits next to Gourlay Peninsula. The cove was named by the UK-APC for the large number of fur seals which frequent the cove and adjacent shore. Inland to the north of Lenton Point is the Hillier Moss, a wet, level, low-lying area, which has several small pools and extensive moss carpets. It was named by UK-APC for Edward R. Hillier, a BAS medical officer.

==Important Bird Area==
The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports substantial and varied seabird breeding colonies. Birds for which the site is of conservation significance are southern giant petrels (2,300 pairs), Wilson&#x27;s storm petrels (200,000 pairs), imperial shags (800 pairs) and brown skuas (100 pairs). Other birds nesting on the island include chinstrap penguins (19,500 pairs), Adélie penguin (16,900 pairs), gentoo penguins (750 pairs), Antarctic prions (50,000 pairs), south polar skuas, snow petrels, Cape petrels, black-bellied storm petrels, snowy sheathbills, kelp gulls and Antarctic terns. Antarctic fur seals haul out in large numbers varying up to over 20,000. Weddell seals breed in winter on the sea ice around the island.

<doc id="180816" wikidata="Q362816" url="?curid=180816" title="Douglas McGregor">
<text>Douglas Murray McGregor (September 6, 1906 – October 1, 1964) was an American management professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and president of Antioch College from 1948 to 1954. He also taught at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta. His 1960 book &quot;The Human Side of Enterprise&quot; had a profound influence on education practices.

McGregor was a student of Abraham Maslow. He has contributed much to the development of the management and motivational theory, and is best known for his Theory X and Theory Y as presented in his book &#x27;The Human Side of Enterprise&#x27; (1960), which proposed that manager&#x27;s individual assumptions about human nature and behavior determined how individual manages their employees.

== Early life and education ==
McGregor was born in Detroit, Michigan on September 6, 1906, to Murray James and Jessie Adelia McGregor. When he was young he volunteered in homeless shelters, played piano, and sang. When McGregor was in high school, he worked for his family business, the McGregor Institute. The McGregor Institute, first known as the Mission for Homeless Men, served the Detroit homeless population with spiritual and career services. McGregor&#x27;s uncle, his father Murray&#x27;s brother, is Detroit philanthropist Tracy W. McGregor.

He earned a B.E. (Mechanical) from Rangoon Institute of Technology, a BA from Wayne State University in 1932, then earned an MA and PhD in psychology from Harvard University in 1933 and 1935 respectively. McGregor originally dropped out of Wayne State to work as a gas station attendant in Buffalo, New York, and was a regional manager by 1930, though he later returned to school. When the McGregor Institute was given a grant by the Detroit Department of Public Works, McGregor returned to Wayne State to finish his degree in 1932.

==Career==
After teaching at Harvard University and then MIT, where he was one of the first professors in the Sloan School of Management, he served as president of Antioch College Ohio, now known as Antioch University Midwest, from 1948 to 1954. In 1954, McGregor returned to teaching at MIT, where he taught until his death in 1964.

He later served as a member of the Antioch College Ohio Board of Trustees.

==&quot;The Human Side of Enterprise&quot;==

In the book &quot;The Human Side of Enterprise&quot;, McGregor identified an approach of creating an environment within which employees are motivated via authoritative direction and control or integration and self-control, which he called theory X and theory Y, respectively. Having an attitude that workers generally lack motivation, enjoyment, and responsibility in their work is a manager that subscribes to Theory X. Having an attitude that workers are content, motivated, and long for responsibility is manager that subscribes to Theory Y. He is responsible for breaking down previous management styles with The X and Y Theory which created a new role for managers to assume. Theory Y is the practical application of Dr. Abraham Maslow&#x27;s Humanistic School of Psychology, or Third Force psychology, applied to scientific management. He is commonly thought of as being a &quot;proponent&quot; of Theory Y, but, as Edgar Schein tells in his introduction to McGregor&#x27;s subsequent, posthumous (1967), book &quot;The Professional Manager:&quot; &quot;In my own contacts with Doug, I often found him to be discouraged by the degree to which theory Y had become as monolithic a set of principles as those of Theory X, the over-generalization which Doug was fighting...Yet few readers were willing to acknowledge that the content of Doug&#x27;s book made such a neutral point or that Doug&#x27;s own presentation of his point of view was that coldly scientific&quot;.

Graham Cleverley in &quot;Managers &amp; Magic&quot; (Longman&#x27;s, 1971) comments: &quot;...he coined the two terms Theory X and theory Y and used them to label two sets of beliefs a manager might hold about the origins of human behaviour. He pointed out that the manager&#x27;s own behaviour would be largely determined by the particular beliefs that he subscribed to...McGregor hoped that his book would lead managers to investigate the two sets of beliefs, invent others, test out the assumptions underlying them, and develop managerial strategies that made sense in terms of those tested views of reality.
&quot;But that isn&#x27;t what happened. Instead McGregor was interpreted as advocating Theory Y as a new and superior ethic – a set of moral values that &quot;ought&quot; to replace the values managers usually accept.&quot;

&quot;The Human Side of Enterprise&quot; was voted the fourth most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management.

== Research interests ==
McGregor&#x27;s research focused on managerial leadership and the ways in which employees are affected by the management styles of their superiors. His 1960 book &quot;The&quot; &quot;Human Side of Enterprise&quot; focused on theory X and theory Y approaches to leadership. His 1967 book &quot;The Professional Manager&quot; built upon the ideas presented in his first book, along with providing behavioral, social, and psychological aspects implications of the previous ideas.

== Personal life ==
He got married at age 19. McGregor was very close to Abraham Maslow. In class, he had a very relaxed teaching style which led his students to enjoy his classes. He would often put his feet up on the desk and lecture at the same time. In 1964, McGregor died at the age of 58 in Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
Since the mid-1950s, Procter &amp; Gamble used Theory X and Theory Y to set up plants in Augusta, Georgia, even hiring McGregor to help. Warren Bennis, leadership expert, researcher, author, and educator, said of McGregor, &quot;Just as every economist, knowingly or not, pays his dues to Keynes, we are all, one way or another, disciples of McGregor.&quot;

In 1964, the School of Adult and Experiential Learning at Antioch College was renamed the &quot;McGregor School&quot; in his honor. It was later renamed &quot;Antioch University McGregor&quot; and then &quot;Antioch University Midwest.&quot; The Douglas McGregor Memorial Award was founded in 1966 in McGregor&#x27;s honor to recognize a leading paper published in &quot;The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science.&quot;

<doc id="180821" wikidata="Q655135" url="?curid=180821" title="Henschel Hs 129">
<text>The Henschel Hs 129 was a ground-attack aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Henschel Flugzeugwerke AG. Fielded by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the Second World War, it saw combat in Tunisia and on the Eastern Front.

During the latter half of 1930s, influenced by the experiences of German &quot;Condor Legion&quot; during the Spanish Civil War, the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM; &quot;Reich Aviation Ministry&quot;) sought a new ground-attack aircraft. The specification required protection from ground-based small arms fire, for which Henschel&#x27;s design (which was initially designated at the &quot;P 46&quot;) incorporated a steel &quot;bathtub&quot; with angled fuselage sides and a compact canopy that was fitted with tiny windows. A further requirement of the specification was that the aircraft be powered by engines that were not in demand for other types; accordingly, the Hs 129 was designed to be equipped with low-power German Argus As 410 engines, which were only capable of .

On 29 May 1939, the prototype Hs 129 performed its maiden flight. Early flight testing was largely unsatisfactory, the aircraft proving to be both underpowered and overweight as well as offering poor visibility to the pilot. These criticisms were addressed via the adoption of a revised canopy with greater glazing along with a more powerful replacement engine in the form of the French Gnome-Rhône 14M engine, which was capable of producing up to . As such, the &quot;Hs 129 A-0&quot; was promptly succeeded by the &quot;Hs 129 A-1&quot; and &quot;Hs 129 B-1&quot;. While Henschel faced competition to fulfil the requirement in the form of the Focke-Wulf Fw 189, the Hs 129 was both smaller and cheaper, and thus continued to hold the RLM&#x27;s favour. Quantity production of the type was achieved during early 1942.

Introduced to &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service in April 1942, the Hs 129 was relatively effective during its early years. It saw service on the Eastern Front in a variety of frontline roles. As the conflict progressed, an increased emphasis on anti-tank support led to the aircraft being continually up-gunned, eventually mounting a 75 mm anti-tank cannon. Only a small number of thus-armed &quot;Hs 129 B-3&quot; aircraft were produced and saw action relatively late in the war. Production of the type peaked in 1943 and was terminated entirely in September 1944 in response to Nazi Germany&#x27;s declining military position, although use of the HS 129 continued into the closing months of the conflict.

==Design and development==
===Background===
By the mid-1930s, the German military, as well as its counterparts in other countries, had identified the importance of ground-attack aircraft for the interdiction of logistics and materiel, a task in which targets were often poorly protected and less likely to have strong or well-coordinated defences. For high-value, well-protected tactical targets, the dive bomber was becoming the conventional solution.

The experience of the German &quot;Condor Legion&quot; during the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) refuted this concept. Even though it was equipped with types unsuited to the role, such as the Henschel Hs 123 and cannon-armed versions of the Heinkel He 112, the &quot;Condor Legion&quot; proved that ground-attack aircraft were effective in actual combat. This determination led to support within the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role, and the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM; &quot;Reich Aviation Ministry&quot;) through its &quot;Technisches Amt&quot; (Technical office) formulated a specification for a Schlachtflugzeug (ground-attack aircraft), specifically intended for the direct support of ground forces.

It was anticipated that the main source of damage to such an aircraft would be small arms fire from the ground, meaning that the aircraft ought to be well-armored around key areas, such as its cockpit and engines. Similar protection was also desirable for the canopy, in the form of 75 mm (2.95 in) thick armored glass. The aircraft was expected to be attacking in low-level, head-on strafing runs, so the cockpit had to be located as close as possible to the nose, in order to maximize the visibility of its targets. Another, non-operational, requirement severely hampered the designs: the RLM insisted that the new design be powered by engines that were not being used in existing aircraft, so that the type would not interfere with the production of established types deemed essential to the war effort.

===Selection and detailed design===
During April 1937, the newly-formulated specification was issued to four companies, Hamburger Flugzeugbau GmbH (later renamed Blohm und Voss), Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH, Gothaer Waggonfabrik AG and the Henschel Flugzeug-Werke AG. Of these, Gotha opted to not respond at all while the Hamburger Flugzeugbau offered their &quot;P-40&quot; project, a development of their two seat Ha 141, however, the ground attack version was considered to be too unconventional and was eliminated. On 1 October 1937, the RLM issued a pair of development contracts for the two other submissions, which had been determined to superior: one was derived from an existing Focke-Wulf reconnaissance type, the Fw 189, while the other was produced by Henschel. Originally designated the &quot;P 46&quot;, Henshel&#x27;s aircraft was later given the official designation of Hs 129 from the RLM in April 1938.

The Hs 129 was designed by Henschel&#x27;s chief designer, Dipl.-Ing. Friedrich Nicolaus; the detailed design work was completed by mid 1938. The basic configuration was of a compact low-wing monoplane with a triangular-section fuselage. It was designed around a single large &quot;bathtub&quot; of steel sheeting that made up the entire nose area of the aircraft, completely enclosing the pilot up to head level. Even the canopy was steel, with only tiny windows on the side to see out of and two angled blocks of glass for the windscreen. To improve the armor&#x27;s ability to deflect bullets, the fuselage sides were angled in, forming a triangular shape, resulting in almost no room to move at shoulder level. There was so little room in the cockpit that the instrument panel ended up under the nose below the windscreen, where it was almost invisible; some of the engine instruments were moved outside onto the engine nacelles&#x27; inboard-facing surfaces and the gunsight was mounted outside on the nose.

During 29 May 1939, the first prototype, designated &quot;Hs 129 V1&quot;, performed its maiden flight. It was promptly joined by two more prototypes, the &quot;Hs 129 V2&quot; and &quot;Hs 129 V3&quot;. These early aircraft participated in competitive evaluations against the Fw 189.

Henschel&#x27;s aircraft came in 12 percent overweight while the engines produced eight percent less power than had been anticipated; accordingly, it flew poorly. A further complication was the poor external visibility available to the pilot from the cramped cockpit. The controls proved to be almost inoperable as speed increased and in testing, the V2 prototype flew into the ground from a short dive on 5 January 1940 because the stick forces were too high for the pilot to pull out. The Focke-Wulf design proved to be no better. Both aircraft were underpowered as a result of their air-cooled, inverted-V12 Argus As 410 engines as well as being relatively difficult to fly.

Nevertheless, the RLM felt they should continue with the concept. The only real deciding factor between the two designs was that the Henschel was smaller and cheaper, thus a further development contract was issued to Henschel for eight &quot;HS 129 A-0&quot; pre-production aircraft while the FW 189 was positioned on low priority as a backup while testing continued with the Hs 129 A-0.

Various improvements were developed by Henschel which resulted in the &quot;Hs 129 A-1&quot; series. This model was armed with a pair of 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons and two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns, along with the ability to carry four 50 kg (110 lb) bombs along the fuselage centreline. During late 1940, the A-1 was evaluated by Luftwaffe pilots, the notable conclusion of which was that the service refused to accept the aircraft in its current configuration.

===Hs 129 B-1===
Even prior to the delivery of the first A-1s, the aircraft already being redesigned in response to an instruction from the RLM to adopt French Gnome-Rhône 14M radial engines, which were captured in some number when France fell and continued to be produced under German occupation. This engine supplied for takeoff, compared with the Argus at . The Gnome-Rhone radials were also made in versions with opposite rotation for the propeller, and were installed on the Hs 129 with the port engine rotating clockwise and the starboard rotating counterclockwise, as seen from nose-on, thus eliminating engine torque problems.

During early 1941, a pair of HS 129 A-1s were refitted with the Gnome-Rhône radials and quickly demonstrated that they possessed more satisfactory performance. Although reviewing pilots were more satisfied with the aircraft&#x27;s performance, complaints continued to be filed about the high stick forces as well as the poor visibility from the canopy. Accordingly, new electronically-actuated trim tabs and a redesign canopy with more extensive glazing was installed on the &quot;HS 129 B-0&quot;, along with a special Revi V12/C sight that was mounted externally just forward of the windscreen. As a result, the aircraft possessed noticeably superior vision. It is believed that all of the A-1s were converted into B-&#x27;s (although it has been claimed that some A-1s were sold to Romania).

During December 1941, the first of ten HS 129 B-0s was developed; in March 1942, the production standard &quot;Hs 129 B-1&quot; commenced manufacture. Initially, the two models were quite similar, although some difference were apparent in terms of the positioning of the radio apparatus and the presence of exposed blast troughs for the guns on the B-1. Furthermore, the aircraft would receive adaptations to permit the carriage of a wide variety of armaments.

In preparation for the arrival of the B-1, I./SchlG 1 had been formed in January 1942 with Bf 109 E/Bs (fighter-bomber version of Bf 109 E) and Hs 123s and they delivered B-0s and every B-1 that was completed. During April 1942, the first 12 B-1s were delivered, enabling the 4th &quot;Staffel&quot; (squadron) to achieve operational readiness. They were promptly assigned to the Eastern Front (to Crimea) in the middle of May 1942 and in June they received a new weapon, the 30 mm (1.2 in) MK 101 cannon with armor-piercing ammunition in a centerline pod. This would be the B1/R2 &quot;Rüstsätze&quot; kit, the B1/R3 had the MK 101 replaced with a ventral tray of four 7.92mm MG 17 machine guns. The B1/R4 had a larger bomb load and the B1/R5 reconnaissance version had a camera.

===Hs 129 B-2===
During May 1942, deliveries of the new &quot;Hs 129 B-2&quot; model commenced, side by side with the B-1 (of which just 50 aircraft had been delivered at that point). By July 1943, (prior to the launch of Operation Citadel, these were a total of five units of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; equipped with HS 129s.

Initially, the only difference between the B-1 and B-2 models were changes to the fuel system – a host of other minor changes could be found almost at random on either model. These changes accumulated in the B-2 production line until they could eventually be told apart at a glance; the main differences being the removal of the mast for the radio antenna, the addition of a direction-finding radio antenna loop, and shorter exhaust stacks on the engines. In the field, the differences became more pronounced. The &quot;Rüstsatz&quot; field refit kits were renumbered and some were dropped, and in general, the Hs 129B-2/R2 aircraft in service with 4./Schlachtgeschwader 1 received the upgraded cannon pack using a 30 mm MK 103 cannon instead of the earlier MK 101. The MK 103 was effectively an upgraded MK 101 that was capable of increased muzzle velocity.

By late 1942, reports were coming in about the ineffectiveness of the MK 101 against newer versions of the Soviet T-34 tanks. One obvious solution would be to use the larger BK 3,7 (&quot;Bordkanone&quot; 3,7), recently adapted from the ground-based 3.7 cm Flak 18. These guns had already been converted into underwing pod-mounted weapons for the Junkers Ju 87G and found to be an effective weapon, despite the fact that only 12 shells per pod could be accommodated. When mounted on the Hs 129, the empty area behind the cockpit could be used for ammunition storage, greatly increasing the supply compared to the Ju. The B-2/R3 package introduced the BK automatic cannon, but relatively few aircraft were converted in favour of the B-2/R4 and B-3, mounting the BK 7.5.

===Hs 129 B-3===
It was decided that the semi-automatic Rheinmetall PaK 40 anti-tank gun, which had already been adapted for use in the Junkers Ju 88 P-1, would be further modified for use in the Hs 129.This resulted in the BK 7,5 (&quot;Bordkanone&quot; 7,5), which, even though it weighed , was lighter than the PaK 40. Fully automatic, it featured a new, hydraulic recoil-dampening system and a new, more aerodynamic muzzle brake. An autoloader system, with 12 rounds in a rotary magazine, was fitted in the empty space behind the cockpit, within the rear half of the wing root area. The gun and its recoil mechanism occupied a substantial gun pod under the fuselage, and a circular port at the rear of the pod allowed rearwards ejection of spent cartridges immediately after firing. While this new variant, the &quot;Hs 129 B-3&quot;, was theoretically capable of destroying any tank in the world, the added weight worsened the aircraft&#x27;s general performance and it was inferior to previous variants.

The &quot;Bordkanone&quot; 7,5 was the heaviest and most powerful forward-firing weapon fitted to a production military aircraft during the Second World War. The only other ground-attack aircraft to be factory-equipped with similar-calibre guns were the 1,420 examples of the North American B-25G and B-25H Mitchell, which mounted either a M4 cannon, or lightweight T13E1 or M5 versions of the same gun, both of which required a crew member to manually reload after each shot. The Japanese Mitsubishi Ki-109 Army Heavy Fighter Interceptor also carried a 75mm gun, but only 24 were produced.

In May 1944, a Hs 129B-2, &quot;Werknummer&quot; 141258, was fitted with a mock-up of the BK 7.5 and underwent aerodynamic testing at Travemünde. The gun fired a 12 kg shell and in an emergency the entire installation could be jettisoned. During August of that year, the first three HS 129 B-3s commenced trials. While deliveries commenced to actual frontline units, around 25 B-3s are believed to have been completed prior to the production line being permanently shut down in September (a small number were reportedly also created by converting B-2 aircraft). In the field, the B-3 proved to be effective even against members of the IS tank family, however, its small numbers meant that it had little effect on the war effort.

===Hs 129 C===
To address the poor performance of the aircraft, plans had been under way for some time to fit the aircraft with newer versions of the Italian Isotta-Fraschini Delta air-cooled inverted V12 inline engine that delivered and weighed some apiece, providing more power than the Argus As 411 engine of similar configuration and lighter (385 kg) weight. The engine installation ran into a number of delays and was still not ready for production when Henschel&#x27;s plant was overrun by the Allies in 1945.

===Hs 129 D===
Planned version of the Hs 129. Powered by either two Junkers Jumo 211 or two BMW 801 to improve its performance. No prototypes were made.

<text>Ulf Dietrich Merbold (; born 20 June 1941) is a German physicist and astronaut who flew to space three times, becoming the first West German citizen in space and the first non-American to fly on a NASA spacecraft. Merbold flew on two Space Shuttle missions and on a Russian mission to the space station &quot;Mir&quot;, spending a total of 49 days in space.

Merbold&#x27;s father was imprisoned in NKVD special camp Nr. 2 by the Red Army in 1945 and died there in 1948, and Merbold was brought up in the town of Greiz in East Germany by his mother and grandparents. As he was not allowed to attend university in East Germany, he left for West Berlin in 1960, planning to study physics there. After the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, he moved to Stuttgart, West Germany. In 1968, he graduated from the University of Stuttgart with a diploma in physics, and in 1976 he gained a doctorate with a dissertation about the effect of radiation on iron. He then joined the staff at the Max Planck Institute for Metals Research.

In 1977, Merbold successfully applied to the European Space Agency (ESA) to become one of their first astronauts. He started astronaut training with NASA in 1978. In 1983, Merbold flew to space for the first time as a payload specialist or science astronaut on the first Spacelab mission, STS-9, aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. He performed experiments in materials science and on the effects of microgravity on humans. In 1989, Merbold was selected as payload specialist for the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 (IML-1) Spacelab mission STS-42, which launched in January 1992 on the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. Again, he mainly performed experiments in life sciences and materials science in microgravity. After ESA decided to cooperate with Russia, Merbold was chosen as one of the astronauts for the joint ESA–Russian Euromir missions and received training at the Russian Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. He flew to space for the third and last time in October 1994, spending a month working on experiments on the &quot;Mir&quot; space station.

Between his space flights, Merbold provided ground-based support for other ESA missions. For the German Spacelab mission Spacelab D-1, he served as backup astronaut and as crew interface coordinator. For the second German Spacelab mission D-2 in 1993, Merbold served as science coordinator. Merbold&#x27;s responsibilities for ESA included work at the European Space Research and Technology Centre on the &quot;Columbus&quot; program and service as head of the German Aerospace Center&#x27;s astronaut office. He continued working for ESA until his retirement in 2004.

== Early life and education==
Ulf Merbold was born in Greiz, in the Vogtland area of Thuringia, on 20 June 1941. He was the only child of two teachers who lived in the school building of , a small village. During World War II, Ulf&#x27;s father Herbert Merbold was a soldier who was imprisoned and then released from an American prisoner of war camp in 1945. Soon after, he was imprisoned by the Red Army in NKVD special camp Nr. 2, where he died on 23 February 1948. Merbold&#x27;s mother Hildegard was dismissed from her school by the Soviet zone authorities in 1945. She and her son moved to a house in , a suburb of Greiz, where Merbold grew up close to his maternal grandparents and his paternal grandfather.

After graduating in 1960 from high school—now —in Greiz, Merbold wanted to study physics at the University of Jena. Because he had not joined the Free German Youth, the youth organization of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, he was not allowed to study in East Germany so he decided to go to Berlin, and crossed into West Berlin by bicycle. He obtained a West German high school diploma () in 1961, as West German universities did not accept the East German one, and intended to start studying in Berlin so he could occasionally see his mother.

When the Berlin Wall was built on 13 August 1961, it became impossible for Ulf&#x27;s mother to visit him. Merbold then moved to Stuttgart, where he had an aunt, and started studying physics at the University of Stuttgart, graduating with a in 1968. He lived in a dormitory in a wing of Solitude Palace. Thanks to an amnesty for people who had left East Germany, Merbold could again see his mother from late December 1964. In 1976, Merbold obtained a doctorate in natural sciences, also from the University of Stuttgart, with a dissertation titled on the effects of neutron radiation on nitrogen-doped iron. After completing his doctorate, Merbold became a staff member at the Max Planck Institute for Metals Research in Stuttgart, where he had held a scholarship from 1968. At the institute, he worked on solid-state and low-temperature physics, with a special focus on experiments regarding lattice defects in body-centered cubic (bcc) materials.

== Astronaut training ==
In 1973, NASA and the European Space Research Organisation, a precursor organization of the European Space Agency (ESA), agreed to build a scientific laboratory that would be carried on the Space Shuttle, then under development. The memorandum of understanding contained the suggestion the first flight of Spacelab should have a European crew member on board. The West German contribution to Spacelab was 53.3% of the cost; 52.6% of the work contracts were carried out by West German companies, including the main contractor ERNO.

In March 1977, ESA issued an Announcement of Opportunity for future astronauts, and several thousand people applied. Fifty-three of these underwent an interview and assessment process that started in September 1977, and considered their skills in science and engineering as well as their physical health. Four of the applicants were chosen as ESA astronauts; these were Merbold, Italian Franco Malerba, Swiss Claude Nicollier and Dutch Wubbo Ockels. The French candidate Jean-Loup Chrétien was not selected, angering the President of France. Chrétien participated in the Soviet-French Soyuz T-6 mission in June 1982, becoming the first West European in space. In 1978, Merbold, Nicollier and Ockels went to Houston for NASA training at Johnson Space Center while Malerba stayed in Europe.

NASA first discussed the concept of having payload specialists aboard spaceflights in 1972, and payload specialists were first used on Spacelab&#x27;s initial flight. Payload specialists did not have to meet the strict NASA requirements for mission specialists. The first Spacelab mission had been planned for 1980 or 1981 but was postponed until 1983; Nicollier and Ockels took advantage of this delay to complete mission specialist training. Merbold did not meet NASA&#x27;s medical requirements due to a ureter stone he had in 1959, and he remained a payload specialist. Rather than training with NASA, Merbold started flight training for instrument rating at a flight school at Cologne Bonn Airport and worked with several organizations to prepare experiments for Spacelab.

In 1982, the crew for the first Spacelab flight was finalized, with Merbold as primary ESA payload specialist and Ockels as his backup. NASA chose Byron K. Lichtenberg and his backup Michael Lampton. The payload specialists started their training at Marshall Space Flight Center in August 1978, and then traveled to laboratories in several countries, where they learned the background of the planned experiments and how to operate the experimental equipment. The mission specialists were Owen Garriott and Robert A. Parker, and the flight crew John Young and Brewster Shaw. In January 1982, the mission and payload specialists started training at Marshall Space Flight Center on a Spacelab simulator. Some of the training took place at the German Aerospace Center in Cologne and at Kennedy Space Center. While Merbold was made very welcome at Marshall, many of the staff at Johnson Space Center were opposed to payload specialists, and Merbold felt like an intruder there. Although payload specialists were not supposed to train on the Northrop T-38 Talon jet, Young took Merbold on a flight and allowed him to fly the plane.

== STS-9 Space Shuttle mission ==

Merbold first flew to space on the STS-9 mission, which was also called Spacelab-1, aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. The mission&#x27;s launch was planned for 30 September 1983, but this was postponed because of issues with a communications satellite. A second launch date was set for 29 October 1983, but was again postponed after problems with the exhaust nozzle on the right solid rocket booster. After repairs, the shuttle returned to the launch pad on 8 November 1983, and was launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A at 11:00a.m. EST on 28 November 1983. Merbold became the first non-US citizen to fly on a NASA space mission and also the first West German citizen in space. The mission was the first six-person spaceflight.
During the mission, the shuttle crew worked in groups of three in 12-hour shifts, with a &quot;red team&quot; consisting of Young, Parker and Merbold, and a &quot;blue team&quot; with the other three astronauts. The &quot;red team&quot; worked from 9:00p.m. to 9:00a.m. EST. Young usually worked on the flight deck, and Merbold and Parker in the Spacelab. Merbold and Young became good friends. On the mission&#x27;s first day, approximately three hours after takeoff and after the orbiter&#x27;s payload bay doors had been opened, the crew attempted to open the hatch leading to Spacelab. At first, Garriott and Merbold could not open the jammed hatch; the entire crew took turns trying to open it without applying significant force, which might damage the door. They opened the hatch after 15 minutes.

The Spacelab mission included about 70 experiments, many of which involved fluids and materials in a microgravity environment. The astronauts were subjects of a study on the effects of the environment in orbit on humans; these included experiments aiming to understand space adaptation syndrome, of which three of the four scientific crew members displayed some symptoms. Following NASA policy, it was not made public which astronaut had developed space sickness. Merbold later commented he had vomited twice but felt much better afterwards. Merbold repaired a faulty mirror heating facility, allowing some materials science experiments to continue. The mission&#x27;s success in gathering results, and the crew&#x27;s low consumption of energy and cryogenic fuel, led to a one-day mission extension from nine days to ten.
On one of the last days in orbit, Young, Lichtenberg and Merbold took part in an international, televised press conference that included US president Ronald Reagan in Washington, DC, and the Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl, who was at a European economic summit meeting in Athens, Greece. During the telecast, which Reagan described as &quot;one heck of a conference call&quot;, Merbold gave a tour of Spacelab and showed Europe from space while mentioning (the beauty of the Earth). Merbold spoke to Kohl in German, and showed the shuttle&#x27;s experiments to Kohl and Reagan, pointing out the possible importance of the materials-science experiments from Germany.

When the crew prepared for the return to Earth, around five hours before the planned landing, two of the five onboard computers and one of three inertial measurement units malfunctioned, and the return was delayed by several orbits. &quot;Columbia&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base (AFB) at 6:47p.m. EST on 8 December 1983. Just before the landing, a leak of hydrazine fuel caused a fire in the aft section. After the return to Earth, Merbold compared the experience of standing up and walking again to walking on a ship rolling in a storm. The four scientific crew members spent the week after landing doing extensive physiological experiments, many of them comparing their post-flight responses to those in microgravity. After landing, Merbold was enthusiastic about the mission and the post-flight experiments.

== Ground-based astronaut work ==
In 1984, Ulf Merbold became the backup payload specialist for the Spacelab D-1 mission, which West Germany funded. The mission, which was numbered STS-61-A, was carried out on the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; from 30 October to 6 November 1985. In ESA parlance, Merbold and the three other payload specialists—Germans Reinhard Furrer and Ernst Messerschmid and the Dutch Wubbo Ockels—were called &quot;science astronauts&quot; to distinguish them from &quot;passengers&quot; like Saudi prince Sultan bin Salman Al Saud and Utah senator Jake Garn, both of whom had also flown as payload specialists on the Space Shuttle. During the Spacelab mission, Merbold acted as crew interface coordinator, working from the German Space Operations Center in Oberpfaffenhofen to support the astronauts on board while working with the scientists on the ground.

From 1986, Merbold worked for ESA at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, Netherlands, contributing to plans for what would become the &quot;Columbus&quot; module of the International Space Station (ISS). In 1987, he became head of the German Aerospace Center&#x27;s astronaut office, and in April–May 1993 he served as science coordinator for the second German Spacelab mission D-2 on STS-55.

== STS-42 Space Shuttle mission==

In June 1989, Ulf Merbold was chosen to train as payload specialist for the International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-1) Spacelab mission. STS-42 was intended to launch in December 1990 on &quot;Columbia&quot; but was delayed several times. After first being reassigned to launch with &quot;Atlantis&quot; in December 1991, it finally launched on the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; on 22 January 1992, with a final one-hour delay to 9:52 a.m. EST caused by bad weather and issues with a hydrogen pump. The change from &quot;Columbia&quot; to &quot;Discovery&quot; meant the mission had to be shortened, as &quot;Columbia&quot; had been capable of carrying extra hydrogen and oxygen tanks that could power the fuel cells. Merbold was the first astronaut to represent reunified Germany. The other payload specialist on board was astronaut Roberta Bondar, the first Canadian woman in space. Originally, Sonny Carter was assigned as one of three mission specialists, he died in a plane crash on 5 April 1991, and was replaced by David C. Hilmers.

The mission specialized in experiments in life sciences and materials science in microgravity. IML-1 included ESA&#x27;s Biorack module, a biological research facility in which cells and small organisms could be exposed to weightlessness and cosmic radiation. It was used for microgravity experiments on various biological samples including frog eggs, fruit flies, and &quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot; slime molds. Bacteria, fungi and shrimp eggs were exposed to cosmic rays. Other experiments focused on the human response to weightlessness or crystal growth. There were also ten Getaway Special canisters with experiments on board. Like STS-9, the mission operated in two teams who worked 12-hour shifts: a &quot;blue team&quot; consisting of mission commander Ronald J. Grabe together with Stephen S. Oswald, payload commander Norman Thagard, and Bondar; and a &quot;red team&quot; of William F. Readdy, Hilmers, and Merbold. Because the crew did not use as many consumables as planned, the mission was extended from seven days to eight, landing at Edwards AFB on 30 January 1992, at 8:07a.m. PST.

== Euromir 94 mission ==
In November 1992, ESA decided to start cooperating with Russia on human spaceflight. The aim of this collaboration was to gain experience in long-duration spaceflights, which were not possible with NASA at the time, and to prepare for the construction of the &quot;Columbus&quot; module of the ISS. On 7 May 1993, Merbold and the Spanish astronaut Pedro Duque were chosen as candidates to serve as the ESA astronaut on the first Euromir mission, Euromir 94.

Along with other potential Euromir 95 astronauts, German Thomas Reiter and Swedish Christer Fuglesang, in August 1993 Merbold and Duque began training at Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia, after completing preliminary training at the European Astronaut Centre, Cologne. On 30 May 1994, it was announced Merbold would be the primary astronaut and Duque would serve as his backup. Equipment with a mass of for the mission was sent to &quot;Mir&quot; on the Progress M-24 transporter, which failed to dock and collided with &quot;Mir&quot; on 30 August 1994, successfully docking only under manual control from &quot;Mir&quot; on 2 September.

Merbold launched with commander Aleksandr Viktorenko and flight engineer Yelena Kondakova on Soyuz TM-20 on 4 October 1994, 1:42 a.m. Moscow time. Merbold became the second person to launch on both American and Russian spacecraft after cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who had flown on Space Shuttle mission STS-60 in February 1994 after several Soviet and Russian spaceflights. During docking, the computer on board Soyuz TM-20 malfunctioned but Viktorenko managed to dock manually. The cosmonauts then joined the existing &quot;Mir&quot; crew of Yuri Malenchenko, Talgat Musabayev and Valeri Polyakov, expanding the crew to six people for 30 days.

On board &quot;Mir&quot;, Merbold performed 23 life sciences experiments, 4 materials science experiments, and other experiments. For one experiment designed to study the vestibular system, Merbold wore a helmet that recorded his motion and his eye movements. On 11 October, a power loss disrupted some of these experiments but power was restored after the station was reoriented to point the solar array toward the Sun. The ground team rescheduled Merbold&#x27;s experiments but a malfunction of a Czech-built materials processing furnace caused five of them to be postponed until after Merbold&#x27;s return to Earth. None of the experiments were damaged by the power outage.

Merbold&#x27;s return flight with Malenchenko and Musabayev on Soyuz TM-19 was delayed by one day to experiment with the automated docking system that had failed on the Progress transporter. The test was successful and on 4 November, Soyuz TM-19 de-orbited, carrying the three cosmonauts and of Merbold&#x27;s samples from the biological experiments, with the remainder to return later on the Space Shuttle. The STS-71 mission was also supposed to return a bag containing science videotapes created by Merbold but this bag was lost. The landing of Soyuz TM-19 was rough; the cabin was blown off-course by and bounced after hitting the ground. None of the crew were hurt during landing.
During his three spaceflights—the most of any German national—Merbold has spent 49 days in space.

== Later career==
In January 1995, shortly after the Euromir mission, Merbold became head of the astronaut department of the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne. From 1999 to 2004, Merbold worked in the Microgravity Promotion Division of the ESA Directorate of Manned Spaceflight and Microgravity in Noordwijk, where his task was to spread awareness of the opportunities provided by the ISS among European research and industry organizations. He retired on 30 July 2004, but has continued to do consulting work for ESA and give lectures.

== Personal life ==

Since 1969, Ulf Merbold has been married to Birgit, and the couple have two children, a daughter born in 1975 and a son born in 1979. They live in Stuttgart.

In 1984, Merbold met the East German cosmonaut Sigmund Jähn, who had become the first German in space after launching on Soyuz 31 on 26 August 1978. They both were born in the Vogtland (Jähn was born in Morgenröthe-Rautenkranz) and grew up in East Germany. Jähn and Merbold became founding members of the Association of Space Explorers in 1985. Jähn helped Merbold&#x27;s mother, who had moved to Stuttgart, to obtain a permit for a vacation in East Germany. After German reunification, Merbold helped Jähn become a freelance consultant for the German Aerospace Center. At the time of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, they were at an astronaut conference in Saudi Arabia together.

In his spare time Merbold enjoys playing the piano and skiing. He also flies planes including gliders. Holding a commercial pilot license, he has over 3,000 hours of flight experience as a pilot. On his 79th birthday, he inaugurated the new runway at the airfield, landing with his wife in a Piper Seneca II.

== Awards and honors ==

In 1983, Merbold received the American Astronautical Society&#x27;s Flight Achievement Award, together with the rest of the STS-9 crew. He was also awarded the Order of Merit of Baden-Württemberg in December 1983. In 1984, he was awarded the Haley Astronautics Award by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (first class). In 1988, he was awarded the Order of Merit of North Rhine-Westphalia. Merbold received the Russian Order of Friendship in November 1994, the Kazakh Order of Parasat in January 1995 and the Russian Medal &quot;For Merit in Space Exploration&quot; in April 2011. In 1995, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering from RWTH Aachen University.

In 2008, the asteroid 10972 Merbold was named after him.

<text>Bruno de Finetti (13 June 1906 – 20 July 1985) was an Italian probabilist statistician and actuary, noted for the &quot;operational subjective&quot; conception of probability. The classic exposition of his distinctive theory is the 1937 , which discussed probability founded on the coherence of betting odds and the consequences of exchangeability.

==Life==
De Finetti was born in Innsbruck, Austria, and studied mathematics at Politecnico di Milano. He graduated in 1927, writing his thesis under the supervision of Giulio Vivanti. After graduation, he worked as an actuary and a statistician at (National Institute of Statistics) in Rome and, from 1931, the Trieste insurance company Assicurazioni Generali. In 1936 he won a competition for Chair of Financial Mathematics and Statistics, but was not nominated due to a fascist law barring access to unmarried candidates; he was appointed as ordinary professor at the University of Trieste only in 1950.

He published extensively (17 papers in 1930 alone, according to Lindley) and acquired an international reputation in the small world of probability mathematicians. He taught mathematical analysis in Padua and then won a chair in Financial Mathematics at Trieste University (1939). In 1954 he moved to the Sapienza University of Rome, first to another chair in Financial Mathematics and then, from 1961 to 1976, one in the Calculus of Probabilities. De Finetti developed his ideas on subjective probability in the 1920s independently of Frank P. Ramsey. Still, according to the preface of his &quot;Theory of Probability&quot;, he drew on ideas of Harold Jeffreys, I. J. Good and B. O. Koopman. He also reasoned about the connection of economics and probability, and thought that guiding principles to be Paretian optimum further inspired by &quot;fairness&quot; criteria. De Finetti held different social and political beliefs through his life: following fascism during his youth, then moving to Christian socialism and finally adhering to the Radical Party.

De Finetti only became known in the Anglo-American statistical world in the 1950s when L. J. Savage, who had independently adopted subjectivism, drew him into it; another great champion was Dennis Lindley. De Finetti died in Rome in 1985.

==Work and impact==
De Finetti emphasized a predictive inference approach to statistics; he proposed a thought experiment along the following lines (described in greater detail at coherence): &quot;You&quot; must set the price of a promise to pay $1 if there was life on Mars 1 billion years ago, and $0 if there was not, and tomorrow the answer will be revealed. You know that &quot;your opponent&quot; will be able to choose either to buy such a promise from you at the price you have set, or require you to buy such a promise from your opponent, still at the same price. In other words: you set the odds, but your opponent decides which side of the bet will be yours. The price you set is the &quot;operational subjective probability&quot; that you assign to the proposition on which you are betting. This price has to obey the probability axioms if you are not to face certain loss, as you would if you set a price above $1 (or a negative price). By considering bets on more than one event, de Finetti could justify additivity. Prices, or equivalently odds, that do not expose you to certain loss through a &quot;Dutch book&quot; are called &quot;coherent&quot;.

De Finetti is also noted for de Finetti&#x27;s theorem on exchangeable sequences of random variables. De Finetti was not the first to study exchangeability, but he brought the subject to greater visibility. He started publishing on exchangeability in the late 1920s, but his 1937 article &quot;La Prévision&quot; (see bibliography) is his most famous treatment.

In 1929, de Finetti introduced the concept of infinitely divisible probability distributions.

He also introduced de Finetti diagrams for graphing genotype frequencies.

The 1974 English translation of his book is credited with reviving interest in predictive inference in the Anglophone world and bringing the idea of exchangeability to its attention.

In 1961 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.
The de Finetti Award, presented annually by the European Association for Decision Making, is named after him. The Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Economics of the University of Trieste is named after him too.

In the 21st century quantum extensions of de Finetti&#x27;s representation theorem have been found to be useful in quantum information, in topics like quantum key distribution and entanglement detection.

<text>Cecil William Mercer (7 August 1885 – 5 March 1960), known by his pen name Dornford Yates, was an English writer and novelist whose novels and short stories, some humorous (the &quot;Berry&quot; books), some thrillers (the &quot;Chandos&quot; books), were best-sellers during the Interwar Period.

The pen name &quot;Dornford Yates&quot;, first in print in 1910, resulted from combining the maiden names of his grandmothers – the paternal Eliza Mary Dornford, and the maternal Harriet Yates.

==Early life==
William (Bill) Mercer was born in Walmer, Kent, the son of Cecil John Mercer (1850–1921) and Helen Wall (1858–1918). His father was a solicitor whose sister, Mary Frances, married Charles Augustus Munro; their son was Hector Hugh Munro (the writer Saki); Bill Mercer is said to have idolised his elder cousin.

Mercer attended St Clare preparatory school in Walmer from 1894 to 1899. The family moved from Kent to London when he joined Harrow School as a day pupil in 1899, his father selling his solicitor&#x27;s practice in Kent and setting up office in Carey Street. Leaving Harrow in 1903, he attended University College, Oxford in 1904, where he achieved a Third in Law.

At university, he was active in the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), becoming secretary in 1906 and president in 1907, his final year. He acted in the 1905 production of Aristophanes’ &quot;The Clouds&quot;, of which the &quot;Times&quot; reviewer said: &quot;Among individual actors the best was Mr. C. W. Mercer, whose &#x27;Strepsiades&#x27; was full of fun, and who possesses real comic talent.&quot; After a small part in the 1906 production of &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, in his final year, he appeared as &#x27;Demetrius&#x27; in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and as &#x27;Pedant&#x27; in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, a production which included the professional actresses Lily Brayton as &#x27;Katherine&#x27;, and her sister Agnes as &#x27;Bianca&#x27;.

Among the many useful friends Mercer made in the OUDS were Gervais Rentoul, who asked him to be his best man, and Lily Brayton&#x27;s husband, actor Oscar Asche, later producer of the play &quot;Kismet&quot;, and writer of &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot;. After university, Mercer took a caravanning holiday in Hampshire, with Asche, Lily, Agnes, and another theatrical couple, Matheson Lang and his wife, Hutin Britton; both Asche and Lang recall that holiday in their memoirs.

Mercer&#x27;s third-class Oxford law degree was insufficient to gain him traditional access to the bar. However, in 1908 his father obtained his son a post as pupil to a prominent barrister, H. G. Muskett, whose practice often required his appearing in court on behalf of the police commissioner. As Muskett&#x27;s pupil, Mercer saw much of the seedy side of London life, some of which is evident in his novels.

In 1909, he was called to the Bar where he worked for several years. In his first memoirs, &quot;As Berry &amp; I Were Saying&quot;, he recalls his involvement in the trial of the poisoner Hawley Harvey Crippen, when he returned from acting with the Old Stagers, at Canterbury, to have first look at the legal brief. Mercer is in a photograph of the Bow Street Court committal proceedings, published in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; of 30 August 1910.

In his spare time, he wrote short stories that were published in &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;The Harmsworth RED Magazine&quot;, &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and the &quot;Windsor Magazine&quot;, maintaining a relationship with this last until the end of the 1930s; after it closed he wrote for the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot;. He also assisted in the writing of &quot;What I Know&quot; (Mills &amp; Boon, 1913) - US title &quot;King Edward As I Knew Him&quot; - the memoirs of C. W. Stamper, who had been motor engineer to King Edward VII.

==The Great War and afterwards==
At the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, Mercer was commissioned as Second Lieutenant in the 3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters), although his stories continued to appear in the &quot;Windsor&quot; until March 1915. In 1915, his regiment left for Egypt and, in November 1915 as part of the 8th Mounted Brigade, he was sent to the Salonika/Macedonian front where the war was in stalemate. Suffering severe muscular rheumatism he was sent home in 1917 and, although he was still in uniform, the War Office did not again post him. He eventually left the army in 1919. In June of that year the &quot;Windsor&quot; carried his first story since the end of the war.

Since 1914, the Mercer family home had been Elm Tree Road, behind the north-west side of Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground in St John&#x27;s Wood, where his friends Oscar and Lily Asche were close neighbours. In autumn of 1919, he and Asche combined to write the stage show &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot;, but the production was not a great success and he did not again attempt to write for the stage. A frequent social – and then romantic – Elm Tree Road visitor was Bettine (Athalia) Stokes Edwards, an American girl who danced in &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot; (and daughter of Robert Ewing Edwards of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) who became Mercer&#x27;s first wife. &quot;The New York Times&quot; announcement of their engagement (28 August 1919) states: &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs Glover Fitzhugh Perin of 57 West Fifty-eight street have announced the engagement of Mrs Perin’s oldest daughter Miss Bettine Stokes Edwards. . . .&quot; suggesting that her father either was dead or divorced; her remarried mother then lived in New York City. Mercer and Bettine married at St James&#x27;s, Spanish Place, in the Marylebone district of London, on 22 October 1919. The month of October also marked the appearance of a story in the &quot;Windsor&quot; called &quot;Valerie&quot; whose female lead made a living as a dancer; this story never appeared in book form.

Mercer decided not to return to the bar, and to concentrate on his writing. He and Bettine lived in Elm Tree Road, where their only child, Richard, was born on 20 July 1920. After the Great War, many ex-officers found that the rise in the cost of living in London precluded maintaining the style of life of a gentleman to which they had become accustomed; some looked beyond England. In 1922, the Mercers emigrated to France, where it was possible to live more cheaply, and where the climate was kinder to Mercer&#x27;s muscular rheumatism.

==French residence==
They chose the resort town Pau, in the western Pyrenees, in the Basses–Pyrénées &quot;département&quot; (now Pyrénées-Atlantiques) – where lived a sizeable British expat colony, but when the Mercers moved in is unknown. In &quot;Dornford Yates – A Biography&quot; (1982), A.J. Smithers reports &quot;exactly how he hit upon the place is not clear&quot;, but Pau figures several times in the memoirs he is presumed to have ghost-written for C.W. Stamper, and so that might be the answer – &quot;anywhere good enough for King Edward VII was good enough for him&quot;.

They rented the Villa Maryland, on Rue Forster, where Mercer proved an exacting husband, while Bettine was a social woman, and by 1929, the failure of their marriage was evident. Bettine had been indiscreet in her extra-marital romantic liaisons, and Mercer sued for divorce. Bettine did not defend, and the divorce was made absolute in September 1933. In the event, she returned to her family in the U.S.

Less than a year later, on 10 February 1934, at Chertsey Register office, Mercer married Doreen Elizabeth Lucie Bowie, whom he met on a cruise in 1932. She was the daughter of London solicitor David Mather Bowie of Virginia Water. Elizabeth was twenty years younger than her new husband, who felt he had met the incarnation of his fictional &quot;Jill Mansel&quot;, thus did he call her &quot;Jill&quot; for the rest of his life. For him, Villa Maryland had many memories of Bettine, so he and Elizabeth decided to build a new house, named &quot;Cockade&quot;. They chose a spot twenty-seven miles south of Pau, a little north-west of Eaux-Bonnes, on the road to the hamlet of Aas; the project is related in &quot;The House That Berry Built&quot;, wherein the name of the house is &quot;Gracedieu&quot; (God&#x27;s Grace). They did not enjoy long residence in Cockade.

With France falling to the Wehrmacht in June 1940, the Mercers hurriedly arranged caretakers for Cockade, and then escaped the country – in company of visiting friends, Matheson Lang and wife – and traversed Spain &quot;en route&quot; to Portugal. They subsequently took ship for South Africa, arriving in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, in 1941.

==The Second World War and the Rhodesian years==
C.W. Mercer was re-commissioned, this time in the Royal Rhodesian Regiment, and attained the rank of major. As the war concluded, the couple realised their plan of returning to Cockade – but were disappointed in the decrepitude of the house and the socially conscious, post-war attitude of their one-time servants. After some months, the Mercers obtained exit visas and returned to Umtali, Southern Rhodesia, (now Mutare, Zimbabwe), where they lived for the rest of his life. Mercer supervised the building of a replacement house for Cockade, another hillside venture, and, in 1948, they moved into &quot;Sacradown&quot;, on Oak Avenue. The furniture in France was shipped to Rhodesia, as were the Waterloo Bridge balusters (see &quot;The House that Berry Built&quot;), which had never reached Cockade, but had been stored in England during the Second World War.

Cecil William Mercer died in March 1960.

==Writings==

Mercer originally wrote short stories for the monthly magazines. His first known published work, &quot;Temporary Insanity&quot;, appeared in &quot;Punch&quot; in May 1910 – this is the first known occasion of his use of his pen name – and his second, &quot;Like A Tale That is Told&quot; appeared in the &quot;Red Magazine&quot; in July 1910. The first known &#x27;Berry&#x27; story to be published, &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;, appeared in &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in September 1910. None of these early stories was ever included in his books. Many of his works began as stories in &quot;The Windsor Magazine&quot;, before being collected in book form by the &quot;Windsor&quot;&#x27;s publishers, Ward Lock. Between September 1911 and September 1939 he had 123 stories published in the &quot;Windsor&quot;, and after it closed, the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; carried three of his stories in 1940 and 1941. Four of his novels were serialised in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; between 1933 and 1938. In the United States four of his novels were serialized in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot; between 1933 and 1939, while others appeared in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Blue Book&quot;.

His first story for &quot;The&quot; &quot;Windsor Magazine&quot; was &quot;Busy Bees&quot;, in September 1911, and this and fourteen subsequent stories from that publication up to the July 1914 issue were republished in book form as &quot;The Brother of Daphne&quot;, in 1914. Some of the stories were edited for the book, to eliminate events, such as marriage, for the leading characters – which suggests that, originally, he had not planned on using the same characters for a story series. The narrator – later identified as &quot;Boy Pleydell&quot; – marries in &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; and possibly in &quot;Busy Bees&quot;, which became chapter VIII &quot;The Busy Beers&quot; in &quot;The Brother of Daphne&quot;, with the end of the story altered to remove the hint of marriage.

His second book, &quot;The Courts of Idleness&quot;, was published in 1920, containing material written before, during, and after the Great War. It was divided into three sections. In Book I Yates introduced a new set of characters similar to, but separate from, &quot;Berry &amp; Co&quot;, in four stories that had appeared in the &quot;Windsor&quot; between December 1914 and March 1915, and a final story from the &quot;Windsor&quot; of June 1919 in which the male characters have their story lines resolved in Salonika, during the Great War. The Interlude has a story entitled &quot;And The Other Left&quot;, from the November 1914 &quot;Windsor&quot;, which is set on the Western Front with a unique set of characters. Book II returns to the &#x27;Berry&#x27; characters, with two pre-war stories from the August and September 1914 &quot;Windsor&quot;, and three post-war stories from the issues of July, August and September 1919. The book&#x27;s final story, &quot;Nemesis&quot;, was written for, but rejected by, &quot;Punch&quot;; subsequently, it appeared in the &quot;Windsor&quot; in November 1919, with the main character named &quot;Jeremy&quot;; for the book he became &quot;Berry&quot;. &quot;Nemesis&quot; was written to the &quot;Punch&quot; length, and so is much shorter than most of the other stories in &quot;The Courts of Idleness&quot;.

The Berry books are semi-autobiographical, humorous romances, often in short story form, and, in particular, feature Bertram &quot;Berry&quot; Pleydell (&quot;of White Ladies, in the County of Hampshire&quot;) and his family – his wife and cousin, Daphne, her brother, Boy Pleydell (the narrator), and their cousins Jonathan &quot;Jonah&quot; Mansel, and his sister, Jill. Collectively, they are &quot;Berry &amp; Co.&quot; Although all five appear in &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;, their precise relationships there are unstated, and Berry and Daphne are referred to as second cousins as late as &quot;Jonah &amp; Co&quot;; later stories feature a simple family tree, showing them to be first cousins descended from two brothers and a sister.

&quot;Berry &amp; Co.&quot; capture the English upper classes of the Edwardian era, still self-assured, but affected by changing social attitudes and the decline of their fortunes. As in many of Yates&#x27; books, grand houses, powerful motor cars, and foreign travel feature prominently in the &#x27;Berry&#x27; stories. In the 1950s, C.W. Mercer wrote two books of fictionalized memoirs, &quot;As Berry and I Were Saying&quot; and &quot;B-Berry and I Look Back&quot;, written as conversations between Berry and his family. They contain many anecdotes about his experiences as a lawyer, but are, in the main, an elegy for a past upper-class way of life.

The &#x27;Chandos&#x27; books, starting with &quot;Blind Corner&quot;, in 1927, marked a change in style and content, being thrillers set mainly in Continental Europe (often in Carinthia, Austria), wherein the hero–narrator, Richard Chandos, and colleagues, including George Hanbury and Jonathan Mansel (who also featured in the &#x27;Berry&#x27; books), tackle criminals, protect the innocent, woo beautiful ladies, and hunt for treasure. These were originally published by Hodder and Stoughton although later they were re-issued by Ward Lock. It is the &#x27;Chandos&#x27; novels to which Alan Bennett especially refers in naming Dornford Yates in the play &quot;Forty Years On&quot; (1972): &quot;Sapper, Buchan, Dornford Yates, practitioners in that school of Snobbery with Violence that runs like a thread of good-class tweed through twentieth-century literature.&quot; Yates also wrote other thrillers in the same style, but with different characters.

Besides these two genres, some of Yates&#x27; novels do not easily fall into either the humorous or the thriller category.

&quot;Anthony Lyveden&quot; was Dornford Yates&#x27;s first novel, telling the story of an impoverished ex-officer. Originally, it was published in monthly instalments in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Windsor Magazine&quot;,

&quot;Valerie French&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Anthony Lyveden&quot; features mostly the same cast. At the start of the book Lyveden is suffering amnesia, and cannot recall the events of the previous book, leading to romantic complications.

&quot;The Stolen March&quot; is a fantasy set in a lost realm, between Spain and France, where travellers encounter characters from nursery rhymes and fairy tales. A planned sequel, &quot;The Tempered Wind&quot;, is referred to in the quasi-autobiography, &quot;B-Berry and I Look Back&quot;, where Yates mentions abandoning the book as it failed to &quot;take charge&quot;.

&quot;This Publican&quot; features a scheming woman and her hen-pecked husband. Some critics have suggested that the portrayal of the villainess represented a thinly-veiled attack on Mercer&#x27;s first wife, although that could imply that the husband was a self-portrait, and as Smithers&#x27; states, &quot;...he would hardly have held himself out in a character so feeble and flaccid.&quot;

&quot;Lower than Vermin&quot; is a novel in which the author defends his views on social class, and criticises the path Britain was following under the post-war Labour government; the title derives from a description of members of the Conservative Party given in a 1948 speech by Labour Party MP and government minister Aneurin Bevan.

&quot;Ne&#x27;er-Do-Well&quot; is a murder story narrated by Richard Chandos, with whom the investigating detective is staying.

&quot;Wife Apparent&quot; was Yates&#x27;s last novel, set in 1956.

==Stage, cinema, and other media==
The 1919 musical play &quot;Eastward Ho!&quot; was written by Oscar Asche (author) with lyrics by Dornford Yates and music by Grace Torrens and John Ansell. It was produced by Edward Laurillard and George Grossmith Jr., and opened at the Alhambra Theatre in London on 9 September and ran for 124 performances.

The BBC produced an adaptation of &quot;She Fell Among Thieves&quot; in 1977, featuring Malcolm McDowell as Chandos, Michael Jayston as Mansel, and Eileen Atkins as Vanity Fair. This adaptation was also used as the first episode of the US TV series Mystery! in 1980.

An episode of the ITV &quot;Hannay&quot; series, &quot;A Point of Honour&quot;, was based on the eponymous short story published in &quot;The Brother of Daphne&quot;, but the source was uncredited.
An audiobook edition of &quot;Blind Corner&quot;, read by Alan Rickman, was produced by Chivers Audio Books.

==Related works==

In 1948 Richard Usborne wrote an article entitled &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen v. Cads and Rotters&quot; about the works of Dornford Yates in Volume 3, Number 11 of &quot;The Windmill&quot;, a literary magazine. Yates was not pleased by the article, but nevertheless Usborne went on to write &quot;Clubland Heroes&quot; (1953; reprinted 1974 and 1983) in which he examined the work of Yates and two contemporary thriller writers, John Buchan and Sapper.

The 1973 novel &quot;Indecent Exposure&quot; by Tom Sharpe plays up the &#x27;Englishman&#x27; that Dornford Yates created in his novels. There is a group of characters in the satirical novel who style themselves as the &#x27;Dornford Yates&#x27; club and who try to emulate the &#x27;Master&#x27; in avoiding reality and a changing world. Sharpe was later hired by the BBC to adapt &quot;She Fell Among Thieves&quot; for television, and used the same satirical approach.

In 1983 Sharpe wrote an introduction to a reprint of Yates&#x27; first Chandos thriller &quot;Blind Corner&quot;, one of a series issued by J.M.Dent &amp; Sons under the title &quot;Classic Thrillers&quot;. Further Yates&#x27; books in the series were &quot;Perishable Goods&quot;, with an introduction by Richard Usborne; &quot;Blood Royal&quot;, with an introduction by A.J.Smithers; &quot;Fire Below&quot;; &quot;She Fell Among Thieves&quot;, with an introduction by Ion Trewin; &quot;Gale Warning&quot;; &quot;Cost Price&quot;; &quot;Red in the Morning&quot;; &quot;An Eye For a Tooth&quot;; and &quot;The Best of Berry&quot;, with an introduction by Jack Adrian.

Following the publication of &quot;Dornford Yates - A Biography&quot; in 1982, Smithers went on to write &quot;Combined Forces&quot; in 1983, subtitled &quot;Being the Latter-Day adventures of Maj-Gen Sir Richard Hannay, Captain Hugh &#x27;Bulldog&#x27; Drummond and Berry and Co&quot;, which has the heroes (and some villains) of Buchan, Sapper and Yates meeting up after World War Two and having further adventures together.

In 2015, Kate Macdonald published &quot;Novelists Against Social Change: Conservative Popular Fiction, 1920–1960&quot;, which examines the work of Buchan, Yates and Angela Thirkell.

<doc id="180828" wikidata="Q142881" url="?curid=180828" title="Frederick Herzberg">
<text>Frederick Irving Herzberg (April 18, 1923 – January 19, 2000) was an American psychologist who became one of the most influential names in business management. He is most famous for introducing job enrichment and the Motivator-Hygiene theory. His 1968 publication &quot;One More Time, How Do You Motivate Employees?&quot; had sold 1.2 million reprints by 1987 and was the most requested article from the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;.

==Personal life==
Herzberg was born in 1923 in Lynn, Massachusetts, to Gertrude and Lewis Herzberg, who were Jewish Lithuanian immigrants. He was brought up in New York City, and enrolled at the City College of New York in 1939. He did not finish his studies as he enlisted in the army. In 1944 he married Shirley Bedell, who later became a pediatrician.

During his military service Herzberg was involved in the relocation of internees from the Dachau Concentration Camp after its liberation. His experience with this work, where he &quot;realized that a society goes insane when the sane are driven insane&quot;, has been seen as central to the development of his working philosophy.

He finally finished his studies and graduated from the City College of New York in 1946. He then decided to move to the University of Pittsburgh where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in science and public health. He completed a Ph.D. at Pittsburgh focused on electric shock therapy. He has a son, Mark, who currently () lives in West New York.

==Research==
Herzberg started his research on organizations in the 1950s. He worked at the University of Utah, where he remained until he retired. Prior to his move to Utah in 1972, Herzberg was professor of management at Case Western Reserve University, where he established the Department of Industrial Mental Health.

His research into the motivation to work was jointly published with Bernard Mausner and Barbara B. Snyderman, and his own &quot;Work and the Nature of Man&quot; was published in 1966.

In his lifetime, Herzberg had consulted for many organizations as well as for the United States and other foreign governments. 

Herzberg&#x27;s papers, covering his work from the 1950s to the 1990s, are held in the special collections archive at the University of Utah. The bulk of the material in the collection dates from the 1970s and 1980s.

==Motivator-Hygiene Theory==

Herzberg is often considered to be a pioneer in the theory of motivation. According to his motivator-hygiene theory, also known as the &quot;two-factor theory&quot; of job satisfaction, people are influenced by two sets of factors: hygiene or maintenance factors, and motivators. The idea behind this distinction is that hygiene factors will not motivate, but if they are not there, they can lower motivation. These factors could be anything from clean toilets and comfortable chairs, to a reasonable level of pay and job security. The theory deals with satisfaction and dissatisfaction in jobs which are not affected by the same set of needs, but instead occur independently of each other. Herzberg&#x27;s theory challenged the assumption that &quot;dissatisfaction was a result of an absence of factors giving rise to satisfaction&quot;.

Motivational factors will not necessarily lower motivation, but can be responsible for increasing motivation. These factors could involve job recognition, potential for promotion or even the work in itself.

Herzberg (1987) describes the growth factors (or &quot;motivators&quot;) as &quot;achievement, recognition for achievement, the work itself, responsibility, and growth or advancement&quot;, which are intrinsic. Intrinsic factors include &quot;orientations toward money, recognition, competition, and the dictates of other people, and the latter includes challenge, enjoyment, personal enrichment, interest, and self-determination&quot;. The hygiene factors (or dissatisfaction-avoidance), which are extrinsic to the job, are &quot;company policy and administration, supervision, interpersonal relationships, working conditions, salary, status, and security&quot;. This extrinsic factor &quot;refers to doing something because it leads to a distinct outcome, something external you expect to receive, and the latter refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable, an internal reward.&quot;

<doc id="180829" wikidata="Q11952971" url="?curid=180829" title="High-level equilibrium trap">
<text>The high-level equilibrium trap is a concept developed by environmental historian Mark Elvin to explain why China never underwent an indigenous Industrial Revolution despite its wealth, stability, and high level of scientific achievement. Essentially, he claims that the Chinese pre-industrial economy had reached an equilibrium point where supply and demand were well-balanced. Late imperial production methods and trade networks were so efficient and labor was so cheap that investment in capital to improve efficiency would not be profitable.

At the same time, an intellectual paradigm shift from Taoism to Confucianism among the intelligentsia moved the focus of academic inquiry from natural science and mathematics, which were conceived of under Taoism as investigations into the mystical nature of the universe, to studies of social philosophy and morality under Confucianism. According to Elvin, this produced an intellectual climate that was not conducive to technical innovation.

By comparison, the economy of Great Britain at the time of the Industrial Revolution was vastly smaller and less efficient than the late imperial Chinese economy. Labor was comparatively more expensive, and internal trade far less efficient than in China. This produced large imbalances in the forces of supply and demand, leading to economic problems which provided a large financial incentive for the creation of scientific and engineering advances designed to address them. At the same time, the Enlightenment had shifted the focus of academic inquiry towards natural sciences, providing the basis for many technical innovations.

==Background==
According to Elvin, Chinese knowledge of science, mathematics, and engineering in the 14th century was far more advanced than anywhere else in the world. He presents the case study of the spinning wheel, a device used to assist in the production of yarn from plant fibers which increased the efficiency of a worker by orders of magnitude. An automatic, water-powered spinning wheel for hemp fiber was described in Chinese scientific manuals by the early 14th century; comparable devices would not be invented in Europe until the 18th century.

Despite providing an enormous gain in worker productivity, the Chinese spinning wheel fell into disuse over the subsequent centuries and was completely unknown by the 17th century, whereas the mechanical automation of spinning in Europe in the 18th century (from manual spinning wheel precursors of the 13th century ultimately sourced from Asia Minor) led directly to a process of technical refinement and engineering improvements that resulted in the Industrial Revolution and widespread mechanization of production of goods beyond yarn.

==Decline of the mechanical spinning wheel in China==
Elvin says that cotton began replacing hemp as the main fiber crop shortly after the mechanical spinning wheel was invented. Cotton produced far higher fiber yields per unit of land than hemp, and was thus far more profitable, so it largely replaced hemp. As hemp fibers are much longer than cotton fibers, existing mechanical spinning wheels designed for hemp could not be used to spin cotton fibers without substantial mechanical modifications to the apparatus. Apparently, no such modifications were ever made. All spinning in China reverted to far less efficient hand-spinning, and the automatic spinning wheel was forgotten. Elvin proposes several factors whose confluence prevented any further technical development of the automatic spinning wheel.

===Cheap labor===
Elvin says that substantially all extant arable land in China was already under cultivation by the 17th century. Prior to that, food production was expanded by simply cultivating new areas rather than through technical improvements in production methods, which was possible only because of China&#x27;s vast size. Once all arable land was under cultivation, the lack of technical progress meant that crop yields were relatively flat, whereas the population continued to grow. This led to a large labor surplus, which drove down wages substantially. He suggests that this abundance of cheap labor rendered the capital investment required for ongoing engineering research and improvements simply not cost-effective compared to hiring laborers to do the work by hand.

Further, the wealthy merchants who financed cotton production wielded effective political control over government officials. They had the trade laws written broadly in their favor in such a way as to prevent any significant accumulation of wealth by the independent peasant contractors who were actually doing the spinning, rendering it less likely that one of the spinners would be in a position to develop efficiency-improving technology.

===Well-developed trade network===
By the cotton period, Elvin says that China&#x27;s trade network had reached an advanced and highly efficient state. As the Chinese economy was enormous, local shortages and crop failures were no longer a major problem as local shortages were quickly alleviated through internal trade with some other part of the vast economy. This removed much of the local economic pressure to increase production efficiency.

===Shift from Taoism to Confucianism===
Elvin says that the Chinese intelligentsia gradually abandoned Taoism in favor of Confucianism around the 14th century. Whereas the Taoist philosophical paradigm had promoted scientific and mathematical investigation as a kind of mystical exploration of the workings of the universe, the Confucian paradigm focused far more on social philosophy and morality, which prompted a general lack of further research in mathematics and natural sciences.

===Decline of serfdom===
During the period when hemp was the dominant fiber crop, many Chinese peasants still lived as serfs and worked under the direct control and supervision of an aristocratic manor lord. Elvin says that this direct supervision of their work by well-educated lords who had broad knowledge of the latest scientific and engineering principles may have contributed to the invention of the automatic spinning wheel as a means of improving their work efficiency. In the cotton-dominant period, however, the practice of serfdom had died out and much spinning was organized as a cottage industry; peasant spinners typically worked at home as independent contractors with no direct supervision. He suggests that their lack of access to education may have helped to prevent the development of technical improvements in the spinning process.

==The high-level equilibrium trap==
Elvin says that these factors in combination produced what he calls a &quot;high-level equilibrium trap.&quot; He says that widespread technical progress results from some large disequilibrium between supply and demand in the economy, which prompts people to find creative new ways to address the difficulties produced by the change. 

The late imperial Chinese economy had reached an equilibrium point. It had become stable, efficient, and well organized. The rapidly growing population but slowly growing amount of agricultural land largely prevented any significant capital surplus from developing, as almost all production was required for basic sustenance. 

The growing population also provided a ready pool of cheap labor. The Chinese economy was enormous and well integrated. The dense and well-developed network of canals yielded a relatively large amount of profit to the upper classes and alleviated local supply shortages. Thus, there was no incentive for further technical refinement, and technical progress stagnated.

==Contrast with Britain==
By contrast, the British economy at the time of the Industrial Revolution was much smaller than China&#x27;s. Local shortages could not be readily alleviated by internal trade; besides being far smaller than China, Britain lacked an efficient internal water-based trade network, which prompted the development of the steam engine and railroads. The early paucity of arable farmland in Britain encouraged technical refinements to improve crop yields at an early date, whereas the vast size of China permitted production to be increased simply by cultivating more land until late in the imperial period. Although overseas colonies provided cheap labor during the Industrial Revolution, local labor in Britain itself was more expensive than in China, providing the capitalist class an incentive to improve worker efficiency.

<text>Leif Garrett (born Leif Per Nervik; November 8, 1961) is an American actor, singer, and television personality. He worked as a child actor, then in the 1970s became famous as a teen idol in music. He later received much publicity for his drug abuse and legal troubles.

==Early life==
Garrett was born in Hollywood, California, to Rik Nervik and actress Carolyn Stellar, and started his entertainment career at age five. His father was absent for most of his life. He graduated from high school aged 15.

==Career==
===Acting career===
Garrett and his sister Dawn Lyn worked a variety of acting jobs. They co-starred in the horror movie &quot;Devil Times Five&quot; as juvenile mental patients who go on a murder spree at an isolated ski resort. Dawn and Leif also guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; as well as &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;.

Garrett&#x27;s more notable performances include the breakthrough role of Jimmy Henderson in &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; (1969); the protagonist&#x27;s son Mike Pusser from the &quot;Walking Tall&quot; movies (1973, 1975, 1977) and the recurring role of Zack Russell on the ABC TV series &quot;Family&quot;. He also played the role of Leonard Unger, the son of Felix Unger (Tony Randall), on the ABC series &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, a part that had been previously played by Willie Aames.

In late 1975, Garrett appeared in the role of Endy Karras in a 12-week CBS drama series &quot;Three for the Road&quot;, with Alex Rocco as his father, Peter Karras, and Vincent Van Patten as his older brother, John Karras. Garrett&#x27;s appearance in the program triggered a response from teenage girls and led to his first appearances in teenage magazines, such as &quot;Tiger Beat&quot;. Garrett also played alongside Lee Van Cleef in two Spaghetti Westerns shot mainly in Israel: &quot;&quot; and &quot;God&#x27;s Gun&quot;. He played the title role in the television film &quot;Peter Lundy and the Medicine Hat Stallion&quot; and also starred in the film &quot;Skateboard&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Garrett returned to acting, appearing in a small role as Bob Sheldon in the 1983 Francis Ford Coppola film &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. In 1985, he starred in &quot;Thunder Alley&quot; as the lead singer of a pop band that is torn apart by drugs, and in &quot;Shaker Run&quot; as a mechanic. Other notable Garrett movies from the decade include &quot;Delta Fever&quot; and the horror film &quot;Cheerleader Camp&quot;. He played a deranged murderer who was in love with his sister in &quot;Party Line&quot;.

===Music career===
In late 1976, Garrett signed a five-album recording contract with Atlantic Records. In early 1977, he released a single called &quot;Come Back When You Grow Up&quot;, and recorded his first album, &quot;Leif Garrett&quot;. The album was released in July 1977, and his first four singles charted modestly on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. All of these hits were covers of late 1950s and early 1960s hits such as the Dion covers &quot;Runaround Sue&quot; and &quot;The Wanderer&quot;. In mid-1978, he signed with Scotti Brothers Records and recorded his second album, &quot;Feel the Need&quot;. Its first single, &quot;I Was Made for Dancin&#x27;&quot;, reached number 10 on the US Hot 100 and number 4 on the UK Singles Chart early in 1979. It became his greatest hit in the US and the UK.

Subsequent singles failed to crack the Top 20 in either country, but he continued to record, releasing the albums &quot;Same Goes for You&quot; (1979), &quot;Can&#x27;t Explain&quot; (1980) and &quot;My Movie of You&quot; (1981) in quick succession. In May 1979, he hosted a TV special, &quot;Leif&quot;, with guest stars Brooke Shields, Marie Osmond, Bob Hope and Flip Wilson.

In 1981, Garrett recorded &quot;I Am a Rebel&quot;, words and music expressly composed for him by Victorio Pezzolla and produced by Richard Finch of KC and the Sunshine Band, which became the theme song for an Italian TV program entitled &quot;Il Barattolo&quot;. He mostly stopped recording music in the early 1980s and concentrated on acting for the rest of the decade. He later claimed the producers would not allow him to make music aimed at an adult audience when he reached his early twenties. In 1986, he provided lead vocals to the song &quot;The Way to Happiness&quot;, and backing vocals to the title track of the L. Ron Hubbard album &quot;The Road to Freedom&quot;.

===1990–2005===
In the mid-1990s, Garrett returned to acting and singing, appearing in the 1995 low-budget horror film &quot;Dominion&quot;, touring with the Melvins and recording vocals for their cover of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; on &quot;The Crybaby&quot; (2000). In 1998, a greatest hits compilation, &quot;The Leif Garrett Collection&quot;, was released. Garrett, however, has stated: &quot;My former record label was bought out. The label was started by me … meaning my music started it, funded it. And then it was bought out by some company that released the Greatest Hits Collection. Not only have I not seen any royalties from that, but they wanted me to promote it—the compensation being a couple of CDs.&quot;

In the late 1990s, Garrett hosted the series &quot;8-Track Flashback&quot; on the cable music channel VH-1, replacing fellow teen idol David Cassidy. VH-1 went on to feature Garrett in a 1999 episode of its &quot;Behind the Music&quot; series.

In 1999, he formed the band Godspeed with Christopher Wade Damerst and Michael Scott (the Distortions, Deadtime Stories). They recorded a three-song EP on Garrett&#x27;s own label, Tongue and Groove Records.

Garrett&#x27;s stage work includes playing the title role in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; and, in late 2000, appearing in the National Theatre of the Deaf&#x27;s production of &quot;A Child&#x27;s Christmas in Wales&quot;. He also appeared in summer stock at The Barn Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Old Timer&quot; in 2001. In the same year, he voiced himself in the animated television series &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;The Thin White Line&quot;.

In 2003, Garrett appeared as himself in the David Spade film &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot;. He co-wrote and sang &quot;Former Child Star&quot; for the film&#x27;s soundtrack and was one of the singers of &quot;Child Stars on Your Television&quot;, which played over the ending credits. He appeared with Aaron Carter in the 2005 film &quot;Popstar&quot;.

===2006–present===
In September 2006, Garrett appeared on the celebrity edition of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. He won the grand prize of $50,000. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2006, Garrett first appeared in Las Vegas with retro act Original Idols Live!, hosted by Barry Williams. The show also featured the Bay City Rollers, Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods, and the Cowsills, with selected appearances by Merrill Osmond, Tony DeFranco, and Danny Bonaduce.

In August 2007, Country Music Television (CMT) cast Garrett in the short-lived &quot;Ty Murray&#x27;s Celebrity Bull Riding Challenge&quot;, among nine celebrities appearing on the show. However, he quit after one episode, citing soreness and lack of desire to continue.

In November 2007, Garrett released the album &quot;Three Sides of...&quot;, which constituted songs he recorded with his current band F8 and his 1990s band Godspeed as well as some new songs.

In 2008, the producers of TruTV&#x27;s &quot;The Smoking Gun Presents: World&#x27;s Dumbest...&quot; added Garrett to their cast, which features comedic commentary from celebrities like Garrett who have had brushes with the law. Garrett has frequently spoofed his troubled past and participates in a wide variety of sketches and skits written specially for him by the show&#x27;s producers. In a 2010 episode, Garrett reenacted his recent arrest with two actors, including Todd Bridges, another show regular, portraying police officers.

Garrett toured South Korea in May 2010, with shows in Seoul and Busan. This marked the 30th anniversary of Garrett&#x27;s first performance in Korea since June 1980. He embarked on another tour of the country in 2013.

Garrett was a cast member in the fourth season of &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&quot;, which documented Garrett&#x27;s struggle with addiction to heroin. The season premiered December 1, 2010. Garrett&#x27;s sister, Dawn Lyn, and mother, Carolyn Stellar (November 6, 1934 – September 2, 2022), who was battling Stage 4 lung cancer, both appeared in Episode 7, which was filmed during Family Day, when the recovering addicts were visited by their loved ones to discuss how their addiction affected their family relationship.

In the early 2010s, Garrett began collaborating with punk rock artist and songwriter Craig Else. He released two singles on the Internet, sharing Else&#x27;s credits, &quot;Everything&quot; (released in 2010) and &quot;Help You, Make You&quot; (released in 2012). The two also recorded a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Old Man&quot;.

He published an autobiography entitled &quot;Idol Truth&quot; in 2019. In the biography and related interviews, Garrett explained that in multiple tracks in his earlier albums, Jim Haas, actually replaced his vocals entirely. The producers had wanted him to &quot;smooth&quot; Garrett&#x27;s uneven vocals, but made the choice sometimes to replace Garrett entirely on his own albums. In some cases, Garrett&#x27;s producers even brought in Haas to sing for Garrett behind a curtain during some live concert tour performances.

==Personal life==
Garrett and actress Nicollette Sheridan dated on and off for five years until 1985. Garrett also dated celebrities such as his former &quot;Family&quot; co-star Kristy McNichol, Tatum O&#x27;Neal, and Justine Bateman. In the 1990s, he was in a long-term relationship with actress Elaine Bilstad, who died in 1999 of a heart ailment.

In October 2001, Garrett was in a personal bankruptcy proceeding in a federal court in Los Angeles. Court papers stated his only regular income was a $1,000 monthly gift from his mother. His only listed possessions were his clothes, some household goods and about $350 in cash. Garrett had accumulated a $76,198 debt in unpaid credit card bills over a four-year period.

===Legal troubles===
Garrett admitted that he started using drugs when he was 14. On November 3, 1979, five days before his 18th birthday, he crashed a Porsche 914 that was being leased to his mother after a midnight party while he was driving to buy more cocaine. His blood alcohol level was three times over the legal limit of that time and place, and he was high on quaaludes. The accident left his passenger and friend, Roland Winkler, a paraplegic. Garrett had only met Winkler about a month earlier. Neither Garrett nor Winkler was wearing a seatbelt. Garrett was later tried as a juvenile on drunk-driving charges; his driver&#x27;s license was suspended for a year and he was placed on a year&#x27;s probation. Winkler sued in January 1980, claiming Garrett was at fault in the accident.

In December 1984, Los Angeles Superior Court ordered Garrett&#x27;s insurers, Transamerica Insurance Co., to pay $3.9 million to Winkler. Jurors assessed total damages in the civil negligence case at $4,215,500, but subtracted 8% of that amount, or $337,240, on the grounds that Winkler contributed to his own injuries by agreeing to ride in a car with a driver who he knew was drunk. Both Garrett and Winkler admitted in court that they were drunk and had taken depressant drugs; the court heard they had each taken equal amounts of alcohol and drugs that night. The panel ordered Garrett to pay $15,000 in punitive damages, which was not diminished by Winkler&#x27;s partial responsibility. Winkler&#x27;s attorney, Edward Steinbrecher, attributed the relatively small punitive damage award to Garrett&#x27;s testimony that his net worth was only $50,000 to $100,000. In 1987, Winkler settled for $6 million with the Premier Insurance Co., which had insured the firm leasing the Porsche to Garrett&#x27;s mother. Garrett and Winkler were reunited in 1999 for an episode of &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, where Garrett was relieved to learn that Winkler had no bad feelings towards him and even said that Garrett&#x27;s actions following the accident had actually saved his life.

Garrett was arrested for possession of cocaine in 1997.

On June 29, 1999, Los Angeles police arrested Garrett in the MacArthur Park area after he allegedly tried to buy heroin and cocaine from undercover officers. In March 2001, a Los Angeles judge issued a warrant for his arrest when he failed to attend court for a progress report required by his 1999 conviction. Two days later, the judge lifted the warrant and dropped the 1999 charges after Garrett submitted evidence that he had completed a rehab program.

In 2004, Garrett was arrested for possession of cocaine. He pleaded guilty in March 2005 to attempted possession of cocaine-based narcotics and was placed on probation. When he failed to appear in court in December 2005 for a status report, a warrant was issued for his arrest.

On January 14, 2006, when Garrett was arrested on a Los Angeles Metro Rail platform for not having a ticket, police found heroin in his possession. Because of the outstanding warrant for violating probation in a cocaine-related arrest, he was held without bail. He agreed to join a strict drug-diversion program, and his release from jail was ordered.

Garrett dropped out of the rehabilitation program and was taken into custody again on March 30 after a Superior Court commissioner determined he failed several drug tests while staying in a live-in drug diversion program. Garrett acknowledged he needed more help. On May 11, after failing to complete court-ordered drug rehabilitation, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years&#x27; probation. He was given credit for the jail time he had already served since March 30.

On February 1, 2010, Garrett was arrested again for possession of narcotics. After denying having any drugs in his possession, he finally admitted to police that he had black tar heroin in his shoe. He posted $10,000 bail and was charged with a felony count of heroin possession. On October 18, 2010, he pleaded no contest to heroin possession in Los Angeles and entered a court-ordered rehabilitation program.

<text>Montel Brian Anthony Williams (born July 3, 1956) is an American television host and actor. He is known for hosting the daytime tabloid talk show &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot;, which ran in syndication from 1991 to 2008. He currently hosts &quot;The Balancing Act&quot; and &quot;Military Makeover with Montel&quot; airing on Lifetime. Williams founded the Montel Williams MS Foundation after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1999. He is noted for his service in both the United States Marine Corps and the United States Navy, from which he retired after 22 years of service.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 3, 1956, Williams attended Andover High School in neighboring Linthicum, Maryland, where he was elected president of his class in both his junior and senior years. He was a good student, athlete, and musician, and he was active in countywide student government issues in Annapolis, Maryland.

Williams was raised as a Roman Catholic and served as an altar server in the Catholic Church.

Montel&#x27;s father, Herman Williams Jr., was a firefighter who in 1992 became Baltimore&#x27;s first African American Fire Chief. Montel&#x27;s mother is biracial.

== Career ==

=== Military ===
Williams enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1974. He completed the one-year Naval Academy Preparatory School course and then in 1975, he was accepted as the first black Marine into the four-year officer training program at the U.S. Naval Academy.

He graduated in 1980 with a degree in general engineering and a minor in international security affairs. He completed Naval Cryptologic Officer training, and spent 18 months in Guam as a cryptologic officer for naval intelligence. He was later supervising cryptologic officer with the Naval Security Fleet Support Division at Fort Meade, Maryland. It was there Williams worked for the National Security Agency, where he was involved in the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983, known as Operation Urgent Fury. On several occasions, he worked to secure the release of United States citizens—typically military personnel who had been captured in foreign lands—returned to U.S. soil. After 17 years of active duty and five more as a reservist, Williams retired in 1996 from the Naval Reserve at the rank of lieutenant commander after 22 years of service. His awards include two Meritorious Service Medals, two Navy Commendation Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, the Navy Achievement Medal, two Navy Expeditionary Medals, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and two Humanitarian Service Medals.

As a civilian, Willams was again honored in 2008 with a Navy Superior Public Service Award for his &quot;continuous support and recognition of Sailors, Marines and their families throughout his 17 years on television&quot;.

=== &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; ===
Williams began &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; (syndicated by CBS Paramount Television) in 1991. In 1996, Williams received a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host. Ratings for the show peaked during the 1996–97 season, with a 4.4 average rating. He was again nominated for Outstanding Talk Show Host in 2002, and the &quot;Montel Williams Show&quot; was nominated for Outstanding Talk Show in 2001 and 2002.

On January 30, 2008, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that CBS TV Distribution had terminated &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; when key Fox-owned stations chose not to renew it for the 2008–09 season. On May 16, 2008, the last episode of &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; aired. Speculation followed the end of &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot;, which was canceled immediately after Williams criticized mainstream news media&#x27;s preference for stories about Hollywood stars over those about military personnel and events. Commentators felt his statements may have alienated the Fox TV Network.

On November 10, 2010, Oprah Winfrey invited Williams, along with former talk show hosts Phil Donahue, Geraldo Rivera, Ricki Lake, and Sally Jessy Raphael as guests on her show. This was the first time that the fellow talkers had appeared together since their programs left the air.

Williams work has been criticized by the Independent Investigations Group, which declared &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; to be noteworthy &quot;Truly Terrible Television&quot; with its satirical TTTV award (for similar reasons, awarded to &quot;every episode featuring Sylvia Browne&quot;).

Controversial self-declared psychic Sylvia Browne featured frequently on &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; from 1991 until its finale in 2008. Williams described Browne as &quot;the most-appearing guest on a talk show in the history of television&quot; and &quot;the longest-running guest in daytime television&quot;, and her appearances included particularly controversial incidents relating to kidnap victims Shawn Hornbeck and Amanda Berry. Williams was criticized for allowing his high-profile show to serve as a channel for Browne, notably by fellow retired military officer Hal Bidlack, with Bidlack publicly asking, &quot;Commander Williams, have you lost your honor?&quot; In February 2019, an episode of &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; featured a segment on television psychics and Williams&#x27; association with Browne was criticized.

=== Acting ===
Williams has also guest-starred in episodic television and off-Broadway plays. Among other roles, he portrayed a Navy SEAL, Lieutenant Curtis Rivers, in three episodes of the television series &quot;JAG&quot;. He also produced and starred in a short-lived television series called &quot;Matt Waters&quot;, which appeared on CBS in 1996. He played an ex-Navy SEAL turned inner-city high school teacher. In 1997 he played Lt Col Northrop, a USAF nuclear missile silo commander, in the fictional movie &quot;The Peacekeeper&quot;. In 2002, he played the judge presiding over Erica Kane&#x27;s (Susan Lucci) murder trial on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. In 2003 he made a guest appearance on the soap as himself to promote an episode of his own show on which several &quot;AMC&quot; stars were scheduled to appear. In 2004 he hosted &quot;American Candidate&quot;, a political reality show on Showtime. Williams has also guest-starred on &quot;The New Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.

Williams also appeared in a Perry Mason movie in 1993 titled &quot;The Case Of The Telltale Talk Show Host&quot;. His character, Boomer Kelly, was a former football player who was appearing on a radio talk show whose owner was found murdered. He was also a voice actor in 2008 in the political satire film &quot;War, Inc.&quot;, providing the voice of the main character&#x27;s GPS tracking device/counselor.

On October 1, 2019, Williams appeared in an episode of the Fox drama &quot;The Resident&quot; entitled, &quot;Flesh of My Flesh&quot;. Williams played himself, as a TV personality covering a nearly impossible cancer surgery being performed on an adoptive mother of seven.

=== Production ===
Williams produced and narrated the Starline Films documentary film &quot;4CHOSEN: The Documentary&quot;, which tells the story about the New Jersey Turnpike shooting in 1998, and the racial profiling case that followed the incident. In 1999, Williams directed the film, &quot;Little Pieces&quot;, starring Grace Morley and Amy Acton.

=== Spokesman ===
Williams was a national spokesman of the Partnership for Prescription Assistance (PPA), a patient assistance program clearinghouse that helps low-income patients apply for free or reduced-price prescription drugs. On November 30, 2007, while in Savannah, Georgia, to promote PPA, he threatened reporters following an earlier interview at which Courtney Scott, a 17-year-old high school intern reporter for the Savannah Morning News, had asked him whether restriction of pharmaceutical profits would discourage research and development of new drugs. Angered by the question, Williams retorted, &quot;I&#x27;m trying to figure out exactly why you are here and what the interview is about,&quot; and subsequently terminated that videotaped interview; Williams later ran into Scott in his hotel and approached her, reportedly saying,&quot; &#x27;Don&#x27;t look at me like that. Do you know who I am? I&#x27;m a big star, and I can look you up, find where you live and blow you up&quot;.

Williams&#x27;s public relations representatives later apologized for his hostile outburst in an issued statement: &quot;I mistakenly thought the reporter and photographer in question were at the hotel to confront me about some earlier comments. I was wrong, and I apologize for my overreaction&quot;. In 2010 Williams became chief spokesman for the Poker Training Network, now Card Geniuses, a MLM-based poker instruction and playing website.

==== Payday loan controversy ====
Williams was a paid spokesperson for MoneyMutual, a lead generator for a payday lending service. In early 2015, a controversy around this position erupted when an education activist, André-Tascha Lammé, accused Williams on Twitter of supporting a company that harms African-American consumers. Williams denied the allegations, stating that Lammé was fundamentally incorrect in his assessment of the loans and their terms. The New York State Department of Financial Services then investigated the claims and Benjamin Lawsky issued a statement on March 10 that it &quot;made no finding of a violation of law by Mr. Williams&quot;. He added that the department had found that &quot;Using Mr. Williams&#x27;s reputation as a trusted celebrity endorser, MoneyMutual marketed loans to struggling consumers with sky-high interest rates – sometimes in excess of 1,300 percent&quot;. SellingSource, the parent company, was fined $2.1 million and ordered to stop advertising to New Yorkers.

=== Campaigning ===
Williams is an outspoken advocate for US military veterans. He has publicly lobbied for government action to promptly resolve the Veterans Affairs scandal.

=== Other work ===
On April 6, 2009, Williams began hosting a daily radio show, &quot;Montel Across America&quot;, on Air America Media. On January 21, 2010, Air America ceased broadcasting, leaving Williams without a radio outlet.

As of May 2009, he started hosting an infomercial for the Living Well Healthmaster, a blender product. It is presented under the title &quot;Living Well with Montel&quot;; the infomercial is structured similarly to his old talk show, featuring guests talking about their health problems, with the Healthmaster mixer being the solution. Later episodes of &quot;Living Well with Montel&quot; advertised a home pressure cooker and an identity theft protection service. In June 2010, Williams began doing infomercials for LifeLock, a security fraud company.

On October 1, 2014, Williams spoke in front of a Congressional committee in support of Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, who was arrested in Tijuana, Baja California, for carrying guns across the U.S.-Mexican border.

Williams was once a Republican, leaving the political party in 1993 and registering as an independent. He is a supporter of LGBT rights. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president as the superior choice, writing that Donald Trump posed a &quot;clear and present danger&quot; to the nation.

On September 2, 2021, Williams was appointed as a Director on the Board of Better For You Wellness, Inc.

=== CBD oil ===
Williams has marketed cannabidiol (also known as CBD oil) products. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Williams &quot;spent years working to develop medicinal-quality CBD to treat his own multiple sclerosis&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Williams has two daughters, Ashley Williams (born 1984) and Maressa Williams (born 1988), with his first wife, Rochele See. Williams married Grace Morley, an exotic dancer on June 6, 1992. They have a son, Montel Brian Hank Williams (born 1993), and a daughter, Wyntergrace Williams (born 1994). The couple divorced in 2000.

In 2001, Williams briefly dated Kamala Harris, who later went on to become Vice President of the United States after winning the 2020 election. Williams tweeted in 2020 that he had &quot;&#x27;great respect&#x27;&quot; for Harris.

In July 2006, Williams proposed to girlfriend Tara Fowler, an American Airlines flight attendant. They married before friends and family on a beach in Bermuda on October 6, 2007.

Williams participated in the 2007 World Series of Poker main event, and planned to donate any potential winnings to American families affected by the Iraq War. He was eliminated on Day 2. During the event, Williams also spoke out about the port security bill signed in 2006 that banned online gaming sites from accepting money transactions from the U.S.

Four months after making a guest appearance in an episode of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, Williams was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1999. In the following year, Williams created the MS Foundation, a nonprofit organization with a focus on research and education. Williams has openly stated that he uses medical cannabis, stating it helps to ease his multiple sclerosis-caused neuropathic pain. Williams has become a vocal advocate of cannabis, supporting efforts to pass medical cannabis laws in the United States, as well as calling for full legalization. He has also said that snowboarding is his &quot;best therapy&quot; for multiple sclerosis, commenting that &quot;When I stand up I need first to hold on to something and think about the positioning of my legs. If I were to just start walking I would fall. I have to get my brain to find my legs and then I will usually take a test step, but I say something at the time to anyone who might be watching to distract from what I&#x27;m really doing. Then I&#x27;ll find places to grab as I walk and talk, sometimes even walking backwards because I have more control that way. People have no idea that I&#x27;m doing this. But when I&#x27;m snowboarding and my feet are strapped in, my brain seems to have a direct connection to my legs. After snowboarding it&#x27;s night and day for my balance and walking. There&#x27;s a real physical change before I get up the mountain and when I come down. The benefits last for days.&quot;

Williams was hospitalized on May 30, 2018, when he had a cerebellar hemorrhagic stroke while working out at a gym.

<text>The Arado Ar 234 &quot;Blitz&quot; (English: lightning) is a jet-powered bomber designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Arado. It was the world&#x27;s first operational turbojet-powered bomber, seeing service during the final years of the Second World War.

Development of the Ar 234 can be traced back to the latter half of 1940 and the request to tender from the Ministry of Aviation to produce a jet-powered high-speed reconnaissance aircraft. Arado was the only respondent with their &quot;E.370&quot; design. While its range was beneath that of the Ministry&#x27;s specification, an initial order for two prototypes was promptly issued to the company, designated &quot;Ar 234&quot;. While both of the prototypes had been mostly completed prior to the end of 1941, the Junkers Jumo 004 turbojet engines were not available prior to February 1943. Due to engine unreliability, the maiden flight of the Ar 234 V1 was delayed until 30 July 1943. In addition to the original reconnaissance-orientated &quot;Ar 234A&quot;, the fast bomber &quot;Ar 234B&quot; model was developed in response to a request by the Ministry of Aviation. Due to a lack of internal space in the relatively slender fuselage, bombloads of up to had to be carried on external racks rather than in internal bomb bays.

The Ar 234 was produced only in small numbers, despite plans for production of 500 per month by late 1945. This was partly due to a lack of available jet engines and other critical materials, for which the aircraft had to compete with other types, such as the Messerschmitt Me 262. Several models were proposed, with alternative engines, cockpit improvements, and adaptations for other roles, including as a night fighter. In late 1944, aerial reconnaissance missions over enemy territory commenced. The Ar 234 was almost entirely used to perform such reconnaissance missions and it was in this capacity that it became the last Luftwaffe aircraft to overfly the United Kingdom during the war, in April 1945. In its capacity as a bomber, the most prominent use of the Ar 234 was the repeated attempts to destroy the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen between 7 and 17 March 1945. Many airframes were destroyed or captured on the ground due to a lack of serviceable engines or fuel.

==Design and development==

===Background===
During the closing months of 1940, the Nazi German Ministry of Aviation offered a tender for a jet-powered high-speed reconnaissance aircraft with a range of . Arado was the only company to respond, offering their &quot;E.370&quot; project, led by Professor Walter Blume. The design was of a high-wing mostly conventional-looking aircraft that was powered by a pair of Junkers Jumo 004 turbojet engines, one being located underneath each wing.

Arado estimated that the E.370 would possess a maximum speed of at , an operating altitude of and a range of . While the range was short of the Ministry&#x27;s specification, it decided to order a pair of prototypes, which were designated as the &quot;Ar 234&quot;. These were largely complete before the end of 1941, but the Jumo 004 engines were not ready until February 1943. When they did arrive, Junkers considered the engines too unreliable for in-flight use and were only cleared for ground tests. Months later, flight-ready engines were finally delivered and on 30 July 1943, the Ar 234 V1 performed its first flight from Rheine airfield.

The second prototype, V2, crashed on 2 October 1943 at Rheine near Münster after suffering a fire in its port wing, the failure of both engines, and instrumentation failures. The aircraft dived into the ground from , killing the pilot. That same year, the third prototype, V3, was displayed to Adolf Hitler at Insterberg, who was enthusiastic about the aircraft and authorised Arado to obtain factory personnel, raw materials, and the funds necessary to build two hundred by the end of 1944. The eight prototype aircraft were fitted with the trolley-and-skid landing gear intended for the never produced Ar 234A version.
The sixth and eighth in the series were powered by four BMW 003 jet engines instead of two Jumo 004s; the sixth had the four engines in individual nacelles, while the eighth had the engines in &quot;twinned&quot; nacelles underneath each wing. A 1942 engineering drawing of the E 370 showed a forward tank, a mid-fuselage tank, and an rear tank with a capacity. These were the first four-engined jet aircraft to fly. The twin-Jumo 004 powered Ar 234 V7 prototype was the first jet aircraft used for a reconnaissance mission, on 2 August 1944.

====Landing gear design ====

The projected weight for the aircraft was approximately . To reduce weight and maximize the internal fuel, Arado did not use retractable landing gear. Instead, the aircraft was to take off from a jettisonable tricycle gear-style trolley, referred to as a nosewheel takeoff-carriage in English, as described in an Ar 234A Typenblatt factory drawing for the V8 prototype, and land on three retractable skids, one under the central section of the fuselage and one under each engine nacelle. The main skid, beneath the fuselage, was originally intended to fully retract, and was originally shown in a 1942-dated engineering drawing, under the E 370 airframe factory development designation, as intended to be made from a three-sided channel-section component, featuring a set of nine triple-beaded wooden rollers within the channel-section main skid. However, this landing gear did not allow aircraft to move after the landing run, which would have left aircraft scattered over an airfield, unable to taxi off the runway. Erich Sommer said that landing the skid-equipped prototypes on a wet grass airstrip &quot;was like greased lightning&quot; and &quot;like [landing on] soap&quot;, due to the complete lack of braking capability.

===Ar 234B===

At the request of the Ministry of Aviation, Arado also produced a pair of prototypes configured as fast bombers, as the &quot;Ar 234B&quot;. On 12 March 1944, the first of these, Ar 234 V9, performed its first flight. It was the first to feature a fully retractable tricycle landing gear, with the main gear retracting forward into the mid-fuselage, and the nose gear retracted rearwards.
The Ar 234&#x27;s slender fuselage was largely filled with fuel tanks, leaving no room for an internal bomb bay, which was carried on external racks. The forward-set cockpit did not provide the pilot with any visibility to the rear, thus the rear firing guns it was fitted with were aimed through a periscope, mounted on the cockpit roof. This periscope could also be flipped forwards for dive-bombing however, its usefulness was impaired by the scope&#x27;s image being flipped upside down. The defensive fixed rear gun system was found to be useless by the pilots, and was omitted in the Ar 234B. The aircraft was widened slightly at mid-fuselage and the central fuel tank was omitted to fit in the main landing gear, while enlarged forward () and aft () fuel tanks compensated for its removal. 

During flight testing, while carrying its maximum bombload of three SC 500 bombs, the Ar 234 V9 could reach at , faster than any other Luftwaffe bomber at the time. The normal bomb load consisted of a pair of bombs suspended from the engines or one large bomb semi-recessed in the underside of the fuselage, while the maximum bombload was . It could also carry the heavier BT 1400 ( unpowered bomb-torpedo), although the ground clearance was limited. If this munition was deployed, the aircraft&#x27;s fuel capacity was noticeably reduced while rocket assistance was needed for takeoff. The pilot would engage the autopilot while using the bomb sight, which was interfaced with the autopilot to adjust the aircraft&#x27;s flight path directly.

Production lines were being set up while the 20 B-0 pre-production aircraft were being delivered, by the end of June. Production was slow, as Arado was to maintain production to compensate for other factories bombed during the USAAF&#x27;s &quot;Big Week&quot;,(20-25 February 1944), in addition to an ongoing license-construction of the Heinkel He 177 heavy bomber. Between mid-1944 and the end of the conflict, only 210 aircraft were built. During February 1945, production switched to the C variant. German plans were for production to reach 500 per month by November 1945.
In addition, some Ar 234 B-2 airframes were modified to serve as night fighters. Designated Ar 234B-2/N and code named &quot;Nachtigall&quot; (Nightingale), these were fitted with FuG 218 &quot;Neptun&quot; VHF-band radar, with a reduced-dipole length version of the standard &quot;Hirschgeweih&quot; eight-dipole element, VHF-band transceiving air interception radar antenna system, and carried a pair of forward-firing 20mm MG 151/20 autocannon within a &quot;Magirusbombe&quot; conformal gun pod on the rear fuselage hardpoint. The radar system was operated by a second crew member in a cramped compartment in the rear. Two of these served with &quot;Kommando Bonow&quot;, a Luftflotte Reich experimental test unit. Operations began in March 1945, but the aircraft was unsuitable for night fighting and no kills were made.

===Ar 234C===

The Ar 234C was equipped with four lighter ( apiece) BMW 003A engines mounted in a pair of twin-engine nacelles based on those from the eighth prototype. The primary reason for this switch was to free up Junkers Jumo 004s for the Me 262, but it also improved takeoff power to nearly (). An improved cockpit, with a slightly bulged outline in the upper contour, and integrating a swept-back fairing for the periscope, and a simplified window design with 13 glazed panels reduced to 8. The BMW jet engines improved top speed by about 20% over the B series airframes.

The C-1 was intended for reconnaissance, the C-2 for bombing, and the C-3 for bombing, ground attack (using anti-personnel bombs) or night fighting (with two additional 20mm MG 151/20s in a forward firing ventral pack). 

During October 1944, the prototype Ar 234 V19 performed its first flight. Although an operational test squadron was being prepared, only 14 C-series airframes were completed by the end of the war, with fewer than half having engines. Some were found at the end of the war sitting in the open, complete but for empty engine nacelles.. Flight testing of the new sub-type hadn&#x27;t started yet when Germany surrendered. Three basic variants of the C-series were planned, with several more laid out as detailed proposals. Some of these would have had a pair of the higher thrust, but heavier Heinkel HeS 011 jet engines, while others were to have swept or &quot;crescent&quot;-type wings.

===Ar 234D===
The D model was intended to be a two-seat aircraft based on the B-series fuselage, but with an enlarged cockpit using fewer glazing panels than the C version, powered by a pair of more powerful Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet engines. The HeS 011 powerplant never reached quantity production, but only 10 examples had been started

===Ar 234P===
The P model was intended to be a two-seat night fighter version with a variant of the D-series cockpit, differing in powerplant options and several options of radar. Several were in the planning stage, but none were produced.

==Operational history==
By 1944, the Luftwaffe&#x27;s bombing capability had been severely reduced from attrition across multiple fronts, and despite the advance offered by the pending arrival of production Ar 234s, there was a shortage of experienced pilots. The first unit-level type conversion orders were issued to III/KG 76 in May 1944 and personnel had to be pulled from the front lines and brought to central Germany for aircraft and engine familiarisation, which was facilitated with two-seat Messerschmitt Me 262s.

Challenges were encountered getting the Ar 234 operational, including poor quality of worksmanship, and severe shortages of certain resources, such as fuel. The reliability of the Jumo 004 engines would worsen over time, a trend attributed to using ill-suited fuels. The engines suffered from frequent flameouts and had to be overhauled or replaced after roughly ten hours of operation, although as ground crews became more skilled, the time needed to swap engines was reduced. The aircraft&#x27;s lengthy takeoff runs were responsible for several accidents and attempts at resolution included improvements to pilot training and the use of jettisonable liquid fuel &quot;Starthilfe&quot; rocket-assisted takeoff units, mounted under each outer wing. Accidents would often be fatal due to the lack of an ejection seat, the pilot instead having to exit via a highly impractical hatch in the floor.

During August 1944, several of Ar 234 prototypes - including six surviving Ar 234A-series prototypes were dispatched on aerial reconnaissance missions. The seventh prototype would perform the first reconnaissance mission over the United Kingdom by a Luftwaffe jet. These reconnaissance flights helped assess the potential for an Allied naval invasion of the Netherlands. Allied piston-engine fighters proved unable to intercept them, being incapable of matching their speed and altitude.

During the autumn of 1944, the first Ar 234Bs began entering service. Early missions included attacks in the Low Countries, at the Antwerp docks and a Brussels railway station. The type was used directly against Allied units during the Battle of the Bulge, and in January 1945, Ar 234s attacked artillery positions to the north of Bastogne. One month later, the Allies were able to capture a crashed Ar 234 after it had been forced down by a Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. The type also saw action in Northern Italy.

Perhaps the most notable use of the Ar 234 in the bomber role was the attempt to destroy the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen. Between 7 March, when it was captured by the Allies, and 17 March, when it finally collapsed, the bridge was continually attacked by III/KG 76 Ar 234s carrying bombs. Most attacks missed the bridge, and heavy losses were experienced from ground-based anti-aircraft guns due to the low altitude these attacks were made from.

By 10 April 1945, 38 operational Ar 234s were reportedly on strength, including 24 reconnaissance aircraft, 12 bombers, and two night-fighters. However, most of these sat waiting for fuel and qualified personnel.

The Ar 234 continued to fly combat missions until the surrender of Germany on 8 May 1945. Several were destroyed by anti-aircraft guns, or &quot;bounced&quot; by Allied fighters during takeoff or on landing when the jets were flying slow and straight, and were most vulnerable. This technique had already been used against Messerschmitt Me 262 jet. Many were captured by the Allies.

==Surviving aircraft==
Only one Ar 234 survives today, a B-2 bomber variant with manufacturer&#x27;s serial number 140312. It was one of nine Ar 234s surrendered to British forces at Sola Airfield near Stavanger, Norway. The aircraft had been operating with &quot;8. Staffel&quot; III./&quot;Kampfgeschwader 76&quot; (later reorganised as &quot;Einsatzstaffel&quot;) during the final weeks of the war, having operated previously with the 8th squadron, carrying the full-four-character &quot;Geschwaderkennung&quot; military code &quot;F1+GS&quot; on the fuselage sides, with the wing code &quot;F1&quot; painted in a much reduced size for late-war &quot;low-visibility&quot; requirements.

Teams of the USAAF&#x27;s Operation Lusty were collecting examples of Luftwaffe technology for study. This aircraft and three others were traded to Operation Lusty by Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown (test pilot and commanding officer of the Enemy Aircraft Flight at the Royal Aircraft Establishment) in exchange for an interview with Hermann Göring who was then being held by the Americans.

The aircraft was flown from Sola to Cherbourg in France on 24 June 1945 where it joined 34 other German aircraft to be shipped to the U.S. aboard the British aircraft carrier . &quot;Reaper&quot; departed from Cherbourg on 20 July and arrived at Newark, New Jersey eight days later. Upon arrival two of the Ar 234s were reassembled (including 140312) and flown by USAAF pilots to Freeman Army Airfield, Indiana for testing and evaluation. 140312 was assigned the foreign equipment number FE-1010. The fate of the second Ar 234 flown to Freeman Field remains a mystery. One of the remaining two was reassembled by the United States Navy at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, for testing, but was found to be in unflyable condition and scrapped.

After receiving new engines, radio and oxygen equipment, 140312 was transferred to Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio and delivered to the Accelerated Service Test Maintenance Squadron of the Flight Test Division in July 1946. Flight testing was completed on 16 October 1946 though the aircraft remained at Wright Field until 1947. It was then transferred to Orchard Place Airport in Park Ridge, Illinois, and remained there until 1 May 1949 when it and several other aircraft stored at the airport were transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. During the early 1950s, the Ar 234 was moved to the Smithsonian&#x27;s Paul Garber Restoration Facility at Suitland, Maryland for storage and eventual restoration.

The Smithsonian began restoring 140312 in 1984 and finished in February 1989. All paint had been stripped from the aircraft before the Smithsonian received it, so the aircraft was painted with the markings of an aircraft of 8./KG 76, the first operational unit to fly the &quot;Blitz&quot;. The final Luftwaffe pilot who flew 140312 prior to Germany&#x27;s surrender in World War II, Willi Kriessmann, was reunited with the aircraft in 1990; Kriessmann also donated his flight logs to the Smithsonian around that time. The restored aircraft was first displayed at the Smithsonian&#x27;s main museum building in 1993 as part of a display titled &quot;Wonder Weapon? The Arado Ar 234&quot;. 

In 2005, 140312 became one of the first aircraft moved to the new Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles International Airport. Today, 140312 is displayed next to the last surviving Dornier Do 335, one of the other aircraft that accompanied it on its voyage across the Atlantic Ocean aboard the &quot;Reaper&quot;. 140312 is displayed with a pair of &quot;Starthilfe&quot; RATO units mounted under its wings. These may be the only surviving examples to be mounted on an aircraft design that actually used them during the conflict.

<doc id="180835" wikidata="Q4408070" url="?curid=180835" title="De Finetti's theorem">
<text>In probability theory, de Finetti&#x27;s theorem states that exchangeable observations are conditionally independent relative to some latent variable. An epistemic probability distribution could then be assigned to this variable. It is named in honor of Bruno de Finetti, and one of its uses is in providing a pragmatic approach to de Finetti&#x27;s well-known dictum &quot;Probability does not exist&quot;.

For the special case of an exchangeable sequence of Bernoulli random variables it states that such a sequence is a &quot;mixture&quot; of sequences of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variables.

A sequence of random variables is called exchangeable if the joint distribution of the sequence is unchanged by any permutation of the indices. In general, while the variables of the exchangeable sequence are not &quot;themselves&quot; independent, only exchangeable, there is an &quot;underlying&quot; family of i.i.d. random variables. That is, there are underlying, generally unobservable, quantities that are i.i.d. – exchangeable sequences are mixtures of i.i.d. sequences.

== Background ==
A Bayesian statistician often seeks the conditional probability distribution of a random quantity given the data. The concept of exchangeability was introduced by de Finetti. De Finetti&#x27;s theorem explains a mathematical relationship between independence and exchangeability.

An infinite sequence

:formula_1

of random variables is said to be exchangeable if for any natural number &quot;n&quot; and any finite sequence &quot;i&quot;1, ..., &quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot; and any permutation of the sequence π:{&quot;i&quot;1, ..., &quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot; } → {&quot;i&quot;1, ..., &quot;i&quot;&quot;n&quot; },

:formula_2

both have the same joint probability distribution.

If an identically distributed sequence is independent, then the sequence is exchangeable; however, the converse is false—there exist exchangeable random variables that are not statistically independent, for example the Pólya urn model.

== Statement of the theorem ==

A random variable &quot;X&quot; has a Bernoulli distribution if Pr(&quot;X&quot; = 1) = &quot;p&quot; and Pr(&quot;X&quot; = 0) = 1 − &quot;p&quot; for some &quot;p&quot; ∈ (0, 1).

De Finetti&#x27;s theorem states that the probability distribution of any infinite exchangeable sequence of Bernoulli random variables is a &quot;mixture&quot; of the probability distributions of independent and identically distributed sequences of Bernoulli random variables. &quot;Mixture&quot;, in this sense, means a weighted average, but this need not mean a finite or countably infinite (i.e., discrete) weighted average: it can be an integral over a measure rather than a sum.

More precisely, suppose &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3, ... is an infinite exchangeable sequence of Bernoulli-distributed random variables. Then there is some probability measure &quot;m&quot; on the interval [0, 1] and some random variable &quot;Y&quot; such that
* The probability measure of &quot;Y&quot; is &quot;m&quot;, and
* The conditional probability distribution of the whole sequence &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3, ... given the value of &quot;Y&quot; is described by saying that
** &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3, ... are conditionally independent given &quot;Y&quot;, and
** For any &quot;i&quot; ∈ {1, 2, 3, ...}, the conditional probability that &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; = 1, given the value of &quot;Y&quot;, is &quot;Y&quot;.

=== Another way of stating the theorem ===

Suppose formula_3 is an infinite exchangeable sequence of Bernoulli random variables. Then formula_3 are conditionally independent and identically distributed given the exchangeable sigma-algebra (i.e., the sigma-algebra consisting of events that are measurable with respect to formula_5 and invariant under finite permutations of the indices).

=== A plain-language consequence of the theorem ===
According to David Spiegelhalter (ref 1) the theorem provides a pragmatic approach to de Finetti&#x27;s statement that &quot;Probability does not exist&quot;. If our view of the probability of a sequence of events is subjective but remains unaffected by the order in which we make our observations, then the sequence can be regarded as &quot;exchangeable&quot;. De Finetti&#x27;s theorem then implies that believing the sequence to be exchangeable is mathematically equivalent to acting as if the events are &quot;independent&quot; and have an objective underlying probability of occurring, with our uncertainty about what that probability is being expressed by a subjective probability distribution function. According to Spiegelhalter: ″This is remarkable: it shows that, starting from a specific, but purely subjective, expression of convictions, we should act as if events were driven by objective chances.&quot;

== Example ==

As a concrete example, we construct a sequence

:formula_1

of random variables, by &quot;mixing&quot; two i.i.d. sequences as follows.

We assume &quot;p&quot; = 2/3 with probability 1/2 and &quot;p&quot; = 9/10 with probability 1/2. Given the event &quot;p&quot; = 2/3, the conditional distribution of the sequence is that the &quot;X&quot;i are independent and identically distributed and &quot;X&quot;1 = 1 with probability 2/3 and &quot;X&quot;1 = 0 with probability 1 − 2/3. Given the event &quot;p&quot; = 9/10, the conditional distribution of the sequence is that the &quot;X&quot;i are independent and identically distributed and &quot;X&quot;1 = 1 with probability 9/10 and &quot;X&quot;1 = 0 with probability 1 − 9/10.

This can be interpreted as follows: Make two biased coins, one showing &quot;heads&quot; with 2/3 probability and one showing &quot;heads&quot; with 9/10 probability. Flip a fair coin once to decide which biased coin to use for all flips that are recorded. Here &quot;heads&quot; at flip i means Xi=1.

The independence asserted here is &quot;conditional&quot; independence, i.e. the Bernoulli random variables in the sequence are conditionally independent given the event that &quot;p&quot; = 2/3, and are conditionally independent given the event that &quot;p&quot; = 9/10. But they are not unconditionally independent; they are positively correlated.

In view of the strong law of large numbers, we can say that

:formula_7

Rather than concentrating probability 1/2 at each of two points between 0 and 1, the &quot;mixing distribution&quot; can be any probability distribution supported on the interval from 0 to 1; which one it is depends on the joint distribution of the infinite sequence of Bernoulli random variables.

The definition of exchangeability, and the statement of the theorem, also makes sense for finite length sequences

:formula_8

but the theorem is not generally true in that case. It is true if the sequence can be extended to an exchangeable sequence that is infinitely long. The simplest example of an exchangeable sequence of Bernoulli random variables that cannot be so extended is the one in which &quot;X&quot;1 = 1 − &quot;X&quot;2 and &quot;X&quot;1 is either 0 or 1, each with probability 1/2. This sequence is exchangeable, but cannot be extended to an exchangeable sequence of length 3, let alone an infinitely long one.

== As a categorical limit == 

De Finetti&#x27;s theorem can be expressed as a categorical limit in the category of Markov kernels.

Let formula_9 be a standard Borel space, and consider the space of sequences on formula_10, the countable product formula_11 (equipped with the product sigma-algebra).

Given a finite permutation formula_12, denote again by formula_12 the permutation action on formula_11, as well as the Markov kernel formula_15 induced by it. 
In terms of category theory, we have a diagram with a single object, formula_11, and a countable number of arrows, one for each permutation.

Recall now that a probability measure formula_17 is equivalently a Markov kernel from the one-point measurable space. 
A probability measure formula_17 on formula_11 is exchangeable if and only if, as Markov kernels, formula_20 for every permutation formula_12.
More generally, given any standard Borel space formula_22, one can call a Markov kernel formula_23 &quot;exchangeable&quot; if formula_24 for every formula_12, i.e. if the following diagram commutes,

giving a cone.

De Finetti&#x27;s theorem can be now stated as the fact that the space formula_26 of probability measures over formula_10 (Giry monad) forms a universal (or limit) cone.
More in detail, consider the Markov kernel formula_28 constructed as follows, using the Kolmogorov extension theorem:
:formula_29
for all measurable subsets formula_30 of formula_10.
Note that we can interpret this kernel as taking a probability measure formula_32 as input and returning an iid sequence on formula_11 distributed according to formula_17. Since iid sequences are exchangeable, formula_28 is an exchangeable kernel in the sense defined above.
The kernel formula_28 doesn&#x27;t just form a cone, but a limit cone: given any exchangeable kernel formula_23, there exists a unique kernel formula_38 such that formula_39, i.e. making the following diagram commute:

In particular, for any exchangeable probability measure formula_17 on formula_11, there exists a unique probability measure formula_42 on formula_26 (i.e. a probability measure over probability measures) such that formula_44, i.e. such that for all measurable subsets formula_30 of formula_10,
:formula_47
In other words, formula_17 is a mixture of iid measures on formula_10 (the ones formed by formula_50 in the integral above).

== Extensions ==
Versions of de Finetti&#x27;s theorem for &quot;finite&quot; exchangeable sequences, and for &quot;Markov exchangeable&quot; sequences have been proved by Diaconis and Freedman and by Kerns and Szekely. 
Two notions of partial exchangeability of arrays, known as &quot;separate&quot; and &quot;joint exchangeability&quot; lead to extensions of de Finetti&#x27;s theorem for arrays by Aldous and Hoover.

The computable de Finetti theorem shows that if an exchangeable sequence of real random variables is given by a computer program, then a program which samples from the mixing measure can be automatically recovered.

In the setting of free probability, there is a noncommutative extension of de Finetti&#x27;s theorem which characterizes noncommutative sequences invariant under quantum permutations.

Extensions of de Finetti&#x27;s theorem to quantum states have been found to be useful in quantum information, in topics like quantum key distribution and entanglement detection. A multivariate extension of de Finetti’s theorem can be used to derive Bose–Einstein statistics from the statistics of classical (i.e. independent) particles.

<text>Oswine, Oswin or Osuine (died 20 August 651) was a King of Deira in northern England.

==Life==
Oswine succeeded King Oswald of Northumbria, probably around the year 644, after Oswald&#x27;s death at the Battle of Maserfield. Oswine was the son of Osric. His succession, perhaps the choice of the people of Deira, split the Kingdom of Northumbria. Oswiu was the successor of Bernicia to the north.

After seven years of peaceful rule, Oswiu declared war on Oswine. Oswine refused to engage in battle, instead retreating to Gilling and the home of his friend, Earl Humwald. Humwald betrayed Oswine, delivering him to Oswiu&#x27;s soldiers by whom Oswine was put to death, probably at Diddersley Hill in North Yorkshire.

Bede recounted the death of King Oswine in 651 and mentioned a place called &quot;Wilfaresdun,&quot; which he explained to mean &quot;Wilfar&#x27;s Hill&quot;. According to Bede, this location was located approximately ten miles away from the village called Cataract, towards the northwest. King Oswin sought refuge in the house of Earl Hunwald, whom he believed to be his loyal friend, along with only one trusted soldier named Tonhere. However, Earl Hunwald betrayed him, and King Oswin was ultimately killed by Ethilwin, Oswy&#x27;s commander, in a treacherous manner&quot; Bede provides us with the following account of the events: 

Understanding this to describe a prominent hill located ten Roman miles (i.e. about 9 imperial miles along the old Roman road) northwest of Catterick, then we are left with one possible location for Wilfar&#x27;s Hill: Diddersley Hill.

== Veneration ==
In Anglo-Saxon culture, it was assumed that the nearest kinsmen to a murdered person would seek to avenge the death or require some other kind of justice on account of it (such as the payment of wergild: a sum of money paid to the relatives of a slain man on account of the killing). However, Oswine&#x27;s nearest kinsman was Oswiu&#x27;s own wife. Oswiu was also related to the slain. In order to confront the justice that was seen to be owed for the murder, Oswiu founded Gilling Abbey, a monastery partly staffed by the relatives of both of their families, and this monastery was given the task of offering prayers for both Oswiu&#x27;s salvation and Oswine&#x27;s departed soul. It was from the same monastery, many years later, that Oswine was later claimed to be a saint.

Oswine is one of many Anglo-Saxon royals who were honoured in monasteries and developed cults as saints. Another example is Edward the Martyr.

Oswine was buried at Tynemouth, but the place of burial was later forgotten. It is said that his burial place was made known by an apparition to a monk named Edmund, and his relics were translated to an honorable place in Tynemouth Priory in 1065. According to Alban Butler, in 1103, Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham, translated the remains from the chapel at Tynemouth, which had fallen into disrepair, to St Alban&#x27;s Abbey in Hertfordshire.

There was a cult of Saint Oswin as a Christian martyr because he had died &quot;if not for the faith of Christ, at least for the justice of Christ&quot;.

==St Oswin&#x27;s Church, Wylam==
The Church of England parish church of Wylam, Northumberland, England is dedicated to Saint Oswin. The church was built in 1886 and currently has a congregation of about 150. The church has a peal of 6 bells (in the tower) and has regular Sunday services with ringing.

==Our Lady &amp; St Oswin&#x27;s Church, Tynemouth==
St Oswin is co-patron (with Our Lady) of the Catholic parish of Tynemouth with a church at the end of Front Street not far from the ruins of the priory where Oswin was buried.

<text>The Blohm &amp; Voss BV 155 is a German high-altitude interceptor aircraft intended to be used by the Luftwaffe against raids by USAAF Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. Work started on the design as the Messerschmitt Me 155 in 1942, but the project went through a protracted development period and change of ownership, and prototypes were still under test and development when World War II ended.

==Background==
Performance estimates of the American B-29 Superfortress reached German command in early 1942. The bomber would cruise at an altitude at which no current German plane could operate effectively. To intercept it, the Luftwaffe would urgently need new aircraft. Work on such a high altitude fighter was begun by Messerschmitt, but in 1943 the project was passed to Blohm &amp; Voss. The result would be the Bv155 prototype that made its first test flight in September 1944.

==Me 155==
The story of the BV 155 began at Messerschmitt in the spring of 1942. A requirement had arisen for a carrier-based single-seat fighter to be based aboard the aircraft carrier , then under construction. In response, Messerschmitt proposed the Me 409, later renamed Me 155. In the interest of economy and simplicity, it was to use as many Messerschmitt Bf 109 components as possible, being basically a navalized version of the earlier Messerschmitt fighter.

The Me 155 was to be powered by a DB 605A-1 liquid-cooled engine of 1,475 PS (1,455 hp, 1,085 kW). The fuselage was more or less that of the standard Bf 109G, but with an entirely new wing. The undercarriage retracted inwards into wing wells, providing the wider track required for safe carrier landings. Standard naval equipment such as folding wings, catapult spools, and arrester gear were to be fitted. Proposed armament was an engine mounted 20 mm MG 151 cannon and two 20 mm MG 151 cannons and two 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns in wings. It had an estimated maximum speed of 649 km/h (403 mph). Three variants were worked out, the Me 155A with one Junkers Jumo 213, the Me 155B powered by a DB 628, which was basically a DB 605A with a two-stage mechanical supercharger with an induction cooler, and the Me 155C with one DB 605A.

Detail design of the Me 155 was complete by September 1942. However, the numerous delays in the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; seemed to indicate that the completion of the carrier would be at least two years away. Messerschmitt was told to shelve the Me 155 project for the indefinite future. Work on the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; carrier was eventually abandoned.

===Me 155A===
In order that all of that work on the Me 155 project not go entirely to waste, Messerschmitt adapted its design in November 1942 to match a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; requirement for a fast single seat bomber. A single 1,000 kg (2,210 lb) SC1000 bomb was to be carried. All of the carrier equipment and most of the armament was removed from the aircraft. Additional fuel tanks were provided and an elongated, non-retractable tailwheel was added to provide ground clearance for the large bomb. The proposal was designated Me 155A in late 1942.

===Me 155B===
By the end of 1942, the increasing number of USAAF bombing raids and intelligence coming in about the new American B-29 bomber led the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to revive development of the Me 155B. The engine was to be the DB 628, which was basically a DB 605A with a two-stage mechanical supercharger with an induction cooler. A pressurized cabin was to be provided. It was estimated that a service ceiling of 14,097 m (46,250 ft) could be attained.

A converted Bf 109G adapted to take the DB 628 engine flew in May 1942 and attained an altitude of 15,500 m (50,850 ft). However, the &quot;Technische Amt&quot; concluded that a DB 603A engine with an exhaust-driven turbosupercharger was more promising. The DB 603A provided 1,201 kW (1,610 hp) for takeoff and 1,081 kW (1,450 hp) at 15,000 m (49,210 ft). This engine change required that the fuselage be elongated in order to house the turbosupercharger aft of the pressure cabin. Exhaust gases were carried to the turbosupercharger via external ducts. Air was drawn in through via a ventral trough aft of the wing. Standard Bf 109G wings were to be fitted outboard of a new, long-span, untapered wing center section. Other parts were scavenged from existing Messerschmitt designs – the vertical tail was from the Me 209, and the horizontal tail and the undercarriage were taken from the Bf 109G. The resulting revision of the Me 155B was designated P.1091 by Messerschmitt.

In August 1943, the RLM realised that Messerschmitt was over-committed and transferred the design work to Blohm &amp; Voss. The design team there came to the conclusion that the existing Messerschmitt design had too many weaknesses and a complete redesign would be necessary.

==BV 155==
In September 1943, an order for five prototypes was placed. Blohm &amp; Voss accepted the order only on condition they had complete design freedom and were not bound by Messerschmitt&#x27;s work to date. The redesign was named the BV 155. B&amp;V gave it a new laminar flow wing and tail unit, landing gear from the Ju 87 and many other parts of the plane. Further wind tunnel testing showed that there was a serious problem with the overwing radiators, at high angles of attack the wing &quot;blanked&quot; them from the airflow and cooling would suffer. Work moved to a revised B model.

The first prototype, BV 155 V1, took off for its maiden flight on 1 September 1944. Tests with the V1 showed that the outboard radiators provided inadequate cooling, especially at high angle of attack. The intakes on the next prototype were enlarged and underslung beneath the wing rather than placed over it. However, the enlarged radiators changed the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity which required moving the pressurized cockpit forward. The Blohm &amp; Voss team took this opportunity to replace the original Bf 109G canopy with an aft-sliding all-round vision canopy, and the rear fuselage decking was cut down. This in turn required that a larger rudder be fitted. The ventral radiator bath was also enlarged.

With these changes, the BV 155 V2 flew on 8 February 1945. Blohm &amp; Voss was still not satisfied with the design, and before the V2 began its flight trials they proposed that the engine be switched to the DB 603U having the larger mechanically driven supercharger of the DB 603E. The DB 603U promised a power of 1,238 kW (1,660 hp) for takeoff and 1,066 kW (1,430 hp) at 14,935 m (49,000 ft). The ventral turbosupercharger was retained. The Technische Amt decided to accept this proposal, and abandoned all work on the BV 155B in favor of the revised design, which was designated BV 155C.

The BV 155 V2 was damaged beyond repair during a bad landing. It was to be replaced in the test program by the BV 155 V3. The BV 155 V3 differed from the V2 in having the DB 603U intended for the BV 155C. However, the engine cowling and turbosupercharger were unchanged.

Various armament schemes for the BV 155B were proposed. One proposal had an engine-mounted (or &quot;Motorkanone&quot;) 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannon and two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons. Another had a &quot;Motorkanone&quot;-mount 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 103 cannon and two wing-mounted 20 mm MG 151 cannons. Estimated maximum speed was 650 km/h (400 mph) at 12,000 m (39,370 ft) and 690 km/h (430 mph) at 15,999 m (52,490 ft). Service ceiling was to be 16,950 m (55,610 ft). Empty weight was 4,869 kg (10,734 lb). Normal loaded weight ranged from 5,126-5,488 kg (11,300-12,100 lb), depending on the armament provided.

According to the Pegasus Models Kit No. 5002 information sheet, V1 and V2 were both provided to the RAF after the war. V1 was flight-tested until it was written off. The fate of V3 is not known, except that it was left half-finished by the end of the war. V2 is in storage at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air And Space Museum&#x27;s storage facility.

===BV 155C Project===
In parallel with the prototype development, Blohm &amp; Voss had been working on additional changes under &quot;Project 205&quot;. P.205 replaced the underwing radiators with an annular one around the front of the engine, a design feature commonly found on a number of German designs. With the wings now free of clutter, they were considerably simpler and were reduced in span. This also had the side effect of reducing the track, which would later prove to be a welcome change. The new design would be simpler, lighter and faster, and plans were made to make it the standard version of the aircraft. During the October re-evaluation, it was agreed that V1 and V2 would be completed as B models, while the V3 would be the prototype for the BV 155C.

The BV 155C was to be significantly different in appearance from the BV 155B. The clumsy wing-mounted radiators of the BV 155B were eliminated, and the main landing gear leg attachment points were moved inboard to retract inwards. Cooling was provided by an annular frontal radiator as in the Focke-Wulf Ta 152. Large circular intakes were attached to the fuselage sides above the wing roots. 30 were ordered but none were built. The V3 was 75% compelete when it was captured. Intended armament for the 155C was two wing-mounted 20mm MG 151/20 cannons and a 30mm MK 108 cannon firing through the spinner.

<text>Victor Harold Vroom (August 9, 1932 – July 26, 2023) was a Canadian psychologist and business school professor at the Yale School of Management.

==Early life==
Vroom was born in Montreal, Quebec on August 9, 1932. He held a PhD from University of Michigan and an MS and BS from McGill University. Dr. Vroom initially was interested in music as a child, but later found interest in psychology after taking a career interests test in high school that showed he had the best potential of being either a musician or a psychologist. He continued to explore his love for music by playing the alto saxophone and clarinet for his high school band and at local clubs around Montreal. After high school graduation, Vroom initially wanted to become a part of a USA big band, but after being instructed by his father to become a bank teller (for a more stable career) Vroom enrolled in Sir George Williams College (now Concordia University). After his freshman year, he transferred to his alma mater, McGill University, where he earned a special honors bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology and a master&#x27;s in industrial psychology. Before beginning his professional career, he finished his terminal degree (PhD) at the University of Michigan. It was at the University of Michigan that he met his first wife, Ann Workman, with whom he had two sons: Derek and Jeffrey. Later on, he met and is survived by his second wife, Julia Francis, with whom he had their two sons Tristan and Trevor. He died on July 26, 2023, at the age of 90 while living in Guilford, Connecticut.

== Career ==
Victor began his professional career as a director for the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, while lecturing. He then took a position at the University of Pennsylvania teaching introductory and foundational courses in psychology, social psychology, and industrial psychology. Later, Vroom began teaching at Carnegie Mellon and began to understand and fit-in more with his strictly business science colleagues. This position eventually propelled him to work for a rebuilding Yale University, where he was appointed chair in only a few weeks, and where he stayed a professor at until his death.

Vroom was also a consultant to a number of corporations such as GE and American Express.

Victor Vroom was appointed Chairman of the Department of Administrative Sciences and associate Director of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale in 1972.

== Theory of Expectancy ==
His primary research was on the expectancy theory of motivation, which attempts to explain why individuals choose to follow certain courses of action and prefer certain goals or outcomes over others in organizations, particularly in decision-making and leadership. His most well-known books are Work and Motivation, Leadership and Decision Making and The New Leadership. In this theory, he suggested that motivation is largely influenced by the combination of a person&#x27;s belief that effort leads to performance, which then leads to specific outcomes, and that such outcomes are valued by the individual. Along with the version of Lyman Porter and Edward Lawler, Vroom&#x27;s formulation is generally considered as representing major contributions to expectancy theory, having stood the test of time and historical scrutiny.

Vroom described the valence of a specific outcome as &quot;a monotonically increasing function of the algebraic sum of the products of the valences of all other outcomes and his conceptions of its instrumentality for the attainment of these other outcomes.&quot; The second proposition central to Vroom&#x27;s theory maintains that &quot;the force on a person to perform an act is monotonically increasing function of the algebraic sum of the products of the valences of all outcomes and the strength of his experiences that the act will be followed by the attainment of these outcomes.&quot;

== Notable Facts ==
Vroom was an avid sailor and captain, having even guided his ship with his family on it during a storm.

Vroom was a part of several semi-professional and professional big bands, one of them he founded in graduate school named &quot;The Intellectuals&quot;.

Vroom once had a health scare, being diagnosed as having advanced-staged carcinoma in 1977. It was later discovered that it was actually sarcoidosis, yet he considered it a near-death experience and used it to fuel a lifestyle change.

<doc id="180840" wikidata="Q7173001" url="?curid=180840" title="Peter Brown (singer)">
<text>Peter Brown (born July 11, 1953) is an American singer-songwriter and record producer. Brown was a popular performer in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His biggest success was the release of the LP in 1977 called &quot;A Fantasy Love Affair&quot; which produced the disco hits &quot;Do Ya Wanna Get Funky with Me&quot; and &quot;Dance With Me&quot;. He wrote, with Robert Rans, Madonna&#x27;s hit &quot;Material Girl&quot;.

==Early life==
Brown was born on July 11, 1953 in Blue Island, Illinois, and raised in Palos Heights, Illinois, both suburbs of Chicago, United States. His mother, Virginia, was artistic and musically talented and gave Peter music lessons at a young age. Peter&#x27;s father, Maurice, was an electronic engineer whose electronics helped Peter learn the technical aspects of recording music. He always brought home the latest technological breakthrough, which in those days included CB and ham radios, the first color television and the first stereo record player.

Maurice also purchased a number of tape recorders, which Peter played with as a child. One of these machines, a TEAC A-1200 two-track, had a feature which allowed transferring recordings on one track to a second track, while simultaneously allowing recording something new on that second track.

==Early career==
Brown became serious about music in his teens and chose to learn the drums. His greatest inspirations in music at the time were Santana; Earth, Wind and Fire; and Chicago. He later became proficient playing timbales, conga drums, and a large number of other percussion instruments. Later, Brown was one of the pioneer users of the musical synthesizer, and for a time he was spokesman for the ARP Synthesizer company, since he used their products almost exclusively in performances and recordings.

As a young man, Brown wanted to become a painter or a graphic artist. After High School he enrolled in The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. 

Brown met Cory Wade, who eventually became his first producer. Wade encouraged Brown to give him some demo tracks for critique. At this point, Brown could use his four-track recorder and his then-innovative synthesizer. Brown subsequently changed his career to music, but thought of being a songwriter, studio musician, or producer. However, Wade suggested that Brown become a producer. Brown assembled a group of musicians to perform his music, inspiring them with stories of his connections with Wade. Among the original members of the band was Pat Hurley, who sang and played keyboard in the band and who eventually co-write lyrics with Brown. Tom Dziallo played bass in the band bass and guitar on all of Brown&#x27;s albums, and Robert Rans became Brown&#x27;s lead keyboard player and primary lyric writing partner for many years. Brown&#x27;s colleague, Robert Vavrik, didn&#x27;t join the band but eventually penned some lyrics with him.

They created some disco music, which was popular at the time, and took the track to TK Records in Hialeah, Florida, for a possible record deal. Within days of the record having been sent, Henry Stone, the president of TK, wanted to release the song just as it was and offered Wade a deal for the single. This was followed by an album deal if the single became successful. Although tempted by the offer, Brown did not want his four-track, home made demo released as the actual record.

Henry Stone and TK Records liked the augmented version, so Brown and Stone made the album deal and settled on a six-month deadline to write new material and record the album. Brown also photographed the album&#x27;s somewhat controversial cover and revealed, in a 1978 interview in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, that he had created the cover&#x27;s nude model out of cardboard, sheer fabric and ribbons.

==Music career (1977–85)==
Late in 1977, TK Records announced that sales of the 12-inch version of &quot;Do Ya Wanna Get Funky With Me&quot; had reached the million dollar mark, making it the first gold 12-inch single in history. The album went gold as well.

&quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Year End #1 Awards for 1978 named Brown the #1 new male album artist, #3 new album artist and #10 pop male artist, as well as #11 pop male album artist, #16 soul artists and #11 soul albums. Cash Box Magazine&#x27;s Year End Awards issue for 1978 named Brown #1 Top Male Single Vocalist, #1 Top New Male Single Vocalist and #2 Top Male Album Vocalist along with #3 Crossover R&amp;B Male.

The 1978 &quot;Record World Magazine&quot; Disco Awards named Brown Outstanding New Performer, Top New Male Vocalist and Top Male Vocalist. He was also nominated by NARAS (The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1978 for a Grammy Award for best R&amp;B Vocal Performance for the song &quot;Dance With Me&quot;. &quot;Dance With Me&quot; also included a guest vocal performance by Betty Wright. In 1979, Brown&#x27;s single &quot;Crank It Up&quot; peaked in the Billboard Disco Chart at No. 4.

Brown&#x27;s first professional performance came on the &quot;American Bandstand&quot; television show, hosted by Dick Clark. That year, Brown also took part in the filming of a television special to promote the upcoming movie &quot;Foul Play&quot; with Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase. He also filmed a segment for the television show &quot;60 Minutes&quot; showing the process of how a song is actually recorded in the recording studio. Later years saw him performing on the &quot;Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and as a presenter on the American Music Awards. On tour in 1978, Brown and his band (now with additional members Keith Anderson, drums, Joe Guzzo, guitar, Mike Hillinger, keyboards and Wildflower, background vocals) played venues as diverse as New York&#x27;s The Bottom Line and Madison Square Garden.

On Brown&#x27;s second album (recorded at Studio Center and Criteria Recording studios in North Miami, Florida), &quot;Stargazer&quot;, he was joined by Laura Taylor and Dan Hartman singing background vocals on the song &quot;It&#x27;s Alright.&quot;

In 1980, Brown released another charting dance song (#6 on Billboard&#x27;s Dance Chart) called &quot;Can&#x27;t Be Love – Do It to Me Anyway&quot;, which was only released as a 12&quot; single and never appeared on an album. The initial success of his career was soon overshadowed by legal disputes and the eventual bankruptcy of TK Records. After the dust cleared, he was able to sign a new record contract with RCA Records with the help of a new management team, Wiesner/DeMann Entertainment. The 1983 album was called &quot;Back to the Front&quot;, and was produced by Brown with executive producer Bob Gaudio (The Four Seasons) and recorded at Gaudio/Valli Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Featured are musical guests Michael Brecker (saxophone) and Michael Boddicker (synthesizers). From this album, the song &quot;Baby Gets High&quot; reached #104 U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; and #6 on Billboard&#x27;s Disco Chart. Brown remained with Freddy DeMann after he started a solo management company whose clients included Madonna and Michael Jackson.

In 1984, Brown co-wrote &quot;Material Girl&quot;, which became one of Madonna&#x27;s biggest hits and signature song. It also made Brown&#x27;s music publishing company, Minong Publishing one of the year&#x27;s top music publishers.

Brown also wrote a song for Agnetha Fältskog, &quot;Maybe It Was Magic&quot;. Peter Cetera from the group Chicago was producing her solo album &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; and liked the song. Brown also wrote &quot;East Meets West&quot; for the Japanese group Sandii &amp; the Sunsetz. Brown&#x27;s final hit was &quot;They Only Come Out at Night&quot; which hit the number one slot on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Dance Chart in April 1984. Brown&#x27;s fourth and final album &quot;Snap&quot; was recorded at Pumpkin Recording Studios in Oak Lawn, Illinois, owned by Gary Loizzo, who was a former member of The American Breed and sang their hit &quot;Bend Me Shape Me&quot; in 1968. This album contained the song &quot;Zie Zie Won&#x27;t Dance&quot; which spawned Brown&#x27;s music video of the same name. The video, filmed in London, was nominated for best video (special effects, art direction and editing) along with videos by Madonna and Bruce Springsteen at the second MTV Music Video Awards in 1985.

In the late 1980s, a severe case of tinnitus prompted Brown to quit the music business in an attempt to preserve his damaged hearing. He began a design company which headed the award-winning redesign of the Chicago Board Options Exchange Internet site, among other wide-ranging design and architectural projects.

In late June 2018, Brown released his fifth album, &quot;Boom&quot;, his first album release in over 30 years. It features 11 tracks of his signature dance/R&amp;B sound. Singles include &quot;Boom&quot;, the &quot;a cappella&quot; title track, &quot;Dancing All Alone&quot;, and &quot;Drama Queen&quot;. &quot;Boom&quot; was written, performed, arranged, recorded, and mixed entirely by Brown on an iMac computer using only Auratone speakers and a Sennheiser MD 441U microphone.

In probability theory and statistics, the hypergeometric distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of formula_13 successes (random draws for which the object drawn has a specified feature) in formula_14 draws, &quot;without&quot; replacement, from a finite population of size formula_15 that contains exactly formula_16 objects with that feature, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure. In contrast, the binomial distribution describes the probability of formula_13 successes in formula_14 draws &quot;with&quot; replacement.

== Definitions ==
=== Probability mass function ===
The following conditions characterize the hypergeometric distribution:
* The result of each draw (the elements of the population being sampled) can be classified into one of two mutually exclusive categories (e.g. Pass/Fail or Employed/Unemployed).
* The probability of a success changes on each draw, as each draw decreases the population (&quot;sampling without replacement&quot; from a finite population).

A random variable formula_19 follows the hypergeometric distribution if its probability mass function (pmf) is given by

:formula_20

where

*formula_15 is the population size,
*formula_16 is the number of success states in the population,
*formula_14 is the number of draws (i.e. quantity drawn in each trial),
*formula_13 is the number of observed successes,
*formula_25 is a binomial coefficient.

The is positive when formula_26.

A random variable distributed hypergeometrically with parameters formula_15, formula_16 and formula_14 is written formula_30 and has probability mass function formula_31 above.

===Combinatorial identities===

As required, we have

:formula_32

which essentially follows from Vandermonde&#x27;s identity from combinatorics.

Also note that

:formula_33

This identity can be shown by expressing the binomial coefficients in terms of factorials and rearranging the latter. Additionally, it
follows from the symmetry of the problem, described in two different but interchangeable ways. 

For example, consider two rounds of drawing without replacement. In the first round, formula_16 out of formula_15 neutral marbles are drawn from an urn without replacement and coloured green. Then the colored marbles are put back. In the second round, formula_14 marbles are drawn without replacement and colored red. Then, the number of marbles with both colors on them (that is, the number of marbles that have been drawn twice) has the hypergeometric distribution. The symmetry in formula_16 and formula_14 stems from the fact that the two rounds are independent, and one could have started by drawing formula_14 balls and colouring them red first.

&quot;Note that we are interested in the probability of formula_13 successes in formula_14 draws without replacement, since the probability of success on each trial is not the same, as the size of the remaining population changes as we remove each marble. Keep in mind not to confuse with the binomial distribution, which describes the probability of formula_13 successes in formula_14 draws with replacement.&quot;

== Properties ==
===Working example===
The classical application of the hypergeometric distribution is sampling without replacement. Think of an urn with two colors of marbles, red and green. Define drawing a green marble as a success and drawing a red marble as a failure. Let &quot;N&quot; describe the number of all marbles in the urn (see contingency table below) and &quot;K&quot; describe the number of green marbles, then &quot;N&quot; − &quot;K&quot; corresponds to the number of red marbles. Now, standing next to the urn, you close your eyes and draw n marbles without replacement. Define &quot;X&quot; as a random variable whose outcome is &quot;k&quot;, the number of green marbles drawn in the experiment. This situation is illustrated by the following contingency table:

Indeed, we are interested in calculating the probability of drawing k green marbles in n draws, given that there are K green marbles out of a total of N marbles. For this example, assume that there are 5 green and 45 red marbles in the urn. Standing next to the urn, you close your eyes and draw 10 marbles without replacement. What is the probability that exactly 4 of the 10 are green?

This problem is summarized by the following contingency table:

To find the probability of drawing k green marbles in exactly n draws out of N total draws, we identify X as a hyper-geometric random variable to use the formula

formula_44 

To intuitively explain the given formula, consider the two symmetric problems represented by the identity

formula_45 

# left-hand side - drawing a total of only n marbles out of the urn. We want to find the probability of the outcome of drawing k green marbles out of K total green marbles, and drawing n-k red marbles out of N-K red marbles, in these n rounds. 
# right hand side - alternatively, drawing all N marbles out of the urn. We want to find the probability of the outcome of drawing k green marbles in n draws out of the total N draws, and K-k green marbles in the rest N-n draws.

Back to the calculations, we use the formula above to calculate the probability of drawing exactly &quot;k&quot; green marbles 
:formula_46

Intuitively we would expect it to be even more unlikely that all 5 green marbles will be among the 10 drawn.

:formula_47

As expected, the probability of drawing 5 green marbles is roughly 35 times less likely than that of drawing 4.

=== Symmetries ===
Swapping the roles of green and red marbles:
: formula_48

Swapping the roles of drawn and not drawn marbles:
: formula_49

Swapping the roles of green and drawn marbles:
: formula_50

These symmetries generate the dihedral group formula_51.

=== Order of draws ===
The probability of drawing any set of green and red marbles (the hypergeometric distribution) depends only on the numbers of green and red marbles, not on the order in which they appear; i.e., it is an exchangeable distribution. As a result, the probability of drawing a green marble in the formula_52 draw is
: formula_53

This is an &quot;ex ante&quot; probability—that is, it is based on not knowing the results of the previous draws.

===Tail bounds===
Let formula_54 and formula_55. Then for formula_56 we can derive the following bounds:

: formula_57

where
: formula_58

is the Kullback-Leibler divergence and it is used that formula_59.

Note: In order to derive the previous bounds, one has to start by observing that formula_60 where formula_61 are &quot;dependent&quot; random variables with a specific distribution formula_62. Because most of the theorems about bounds in sum of random variables are concerned with &quot;independent&quot; sequences of them, one has to first create a sequence formula_63 of &quot;independent&quot; random variables with the same distribution formula_62 and apply the theorems on formula_65. Then, it is proved from Hoeffding that the results and bounds obtained via this process hold for formula_19 as well.

If &quot;n&quot; is larger than &quot;N&quot;/2, it can be useful to apply symmetry to &quot;invert&quot; the bounds, which give you the following:

: formula_67

== Statistical Inference ==
=== Hypergeometric test ===
The hypergeometric test uses the hypergeometric distribution to measure the statistical significance of having drawn a sample consisting of a specific number of formula_13 successes (out of formula_14 total draws) from a population of size formula_15 containing formula_16 successes. In a test for over-representation of successes in the sample, the hypergeometric p-value is calculated as the probability of randomly drawing formula_13 or more successes from the population in formula_14 total draws. In a test for under-representation, the p-value is the probability of randomly drawing formula_13 or fewer successes.

The test based on the hypergeometric distribution (hypergeometric test) is identical to the corresponding one-tailed version of Fisher&#x27;s exact test. Reciprocally, the p-value of a two-sided Fisher&#x27;s exact test can be calculated as the sum of two appropriate hypergeometric tests (for more information see).

The test is often used to identify which sub-populations are over- or under-represented in a sample. This test has a wide range of applications. For example, a marketing group could use the test to understand their customer base by testing a set of known customers for over-representation of various demographic subgroups (e.g., women, people under 30).

== Related distributions ==
Let formula_75 and formula_55.

*If formula_77 then formula_19 has a Bernoulli distribution with parameter formula_79.
*Let formula_80 have a binomial distribution with parameters formula_14 and formula_79; this models the number of successes in the analogous sampling problem &quot;with&quot; replacement. If formula_15 and formula_16 are large compared to formula_14, and formula_79 is not close to 0 or 1, then formula_19 and formula_80 have similar distributions, i.e., formula_89.
*If formula_14 is large, formula_15 and formula_16 are large compared to formula_14, and formula_79 is not close to 0 or 1, then
::formula_95

where formula_96 is the standard normal distribution function
* If the probabilities of drawing a green or red marble are not equal (e.g. because green marbles are bigger/easier to grasp than red marbles) then formula_19 has a noncentral hypergeometric distribution
* The beta-binomial distribution is a conjugate prior for the hypergeometric distribution.

The following table describes four distributions related to the number of successes in a sequence of draws: 
=== Multivariate hypergeometric distribution ===
{\binom{N}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

The model of an urn with green and red marbles can be extended to the case where there are more than two colors of marbles. If there are &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot; marbles of color &quot;i&quot; in the urn and you take &quot;n&quot; marbles at random without replacement, then the number of marbles of each color in the sample (&quot;k&quot;1, &quot;k&quot;2..., &quot;k&quot;&quot;c&quot;) has the multivariate hypergeometric distribution: 

:formula_102

This has the same relationship to the multinomial distribution that the hypergeometric distribution has to the binomial distribution—the multinomial distribution is the &quot;with-replacement&quot; distribution and the multivariate hypergeometric is the &quot;without-replacement&quot; distribution.

The properties of this distribution are given in the adjacent table, where &quot;c&quot; is the number of different colors and formula_103 is the total number of marbles in the urn.

==== Example ====
Suppose there are 5 black, 10 white, and 15 red marbles in an urn. If six marbles are chosen without replacement, the probability that exactly two of each color are chosen is
: formula_104

==Occurrence and applications==

===Application to auditing elections===
Election audits typically test a sample of machine-counted precincts to see if recounts by hand or machine match the original counts. Mismatches result in either a report or a larger recount. The sampling rates are usually defined by law, not statistical design, so for a legally defined sample size , what is the probability of missing a problem which is present in precincts, such as a hack or bug? This is the probability that Bugs are often obscure, and a hacker can minimize detection by affecting only a few precincts, which will still affect close elections, so a plausible scenario is for to be on the order of 5% of . Audits typically cover 1% to 10% of precincts (often 3%), so they have a high chance of missing a problem. For example, if a problem is present in 5 of 100 precincts, a 3% sample has 86% probability that so the problem would not be noticed, and only 14% probability of the problem appearing in the sample (positive ):
: formula_105

The sample would need 45 precincts in order to have probability under 5% that &quot;k&quot; = 0 in the sample, and thus have probability over 95% of finding the problem:

=== Application to Texas hold&#x27;em poker ===
In hold&#x27;em poker players make the best hand they can combining the two cards in their hand with the 5 cards (community cards) eventually turned up on the table. The deck has 52 and there are 13 of each suit.
For this example assume a player has 2 clubs in the hand and there are 3 cards showing on the table, 2 of which are also clubs. The player would like to know the probability of one of the next 2 cards to be shown being a club to complete the flush.
(Note that the probability calculated in this example assumes no information is known about the cards in the other players&#x27; hands; however, experienced poker players may consider how the other players place their bets (check, call, raise, or fold) in considering the probability for each scenario. Strictly speaking, the approach to calculating success probabilities outlined here is accurate in a scenario where there is just one player at the table; in a multiplayer game this probability might be adjusted somewhat based on the betting play of the opponents.)

There are 4 clubs showing so there are 9 clubs still unseen. There are 5 cards showing (2 in the hand and 3 on the table) so there are formula_107 still unseen.

The probability that one of the next two cards turned is a club can be calculated using hypergeometric with formula_108 and formula_109. (about 31.64%)

The probability that both of the next two cards turned are clubs can be calculated using hypergeometric with formula_110 and formula_109. (about 3.33%)

The probability that neither of the next two cards turned are clubs can be calculated using hypergeometric with formula_112 and formula_109. (about 65.03%)

=== Application to Keno ===
The hypergeometric distribution is indispensable for calculating Keno odds. In Keno, 20 balls are randomly drawn from a collection of 80 numbered balls in a container, rather like American Bingo. Prior to each draw, a player selects a certain number of &quot;spots&quot; by marking a paper form supplied for this purpose. For example, a player might &quot;play a 6-spot&quot; by marking 6 numbers, each from a range of 1 through 80 inclusive. Then (after all players have taken their forms to a cashier and been given a duplicate of their marked form, and paid their wager) 20 balls are drawn. Some of the balls drawn may match some or all of the balls selected by the player. Generally speaking, the more &quot;hits&quot; (balls drawn that match player numbers selected) the greater the payoff.

For example, if a customer bets (&quot;plays&quot;) $1 for a 6-spot (not an uncommon example) and hits 4 out of the 6, the casino would pay out $4. Payouts can vary from one casino to the next, but $4 is a typical value here. The probability of this event is:
:formula_114

Similarly, the chance for hitting 5 spots out of 6 selected is
formula_115
while a typical payout might be $88. The payout for hitting all 6 would be around $1500 (probability ≈ 0.000128985 or 7752-to-1). The only other nonzero payout might be $1 for hitting 3 numbers (i.e., you get your bet back), which has a probability near 0.129819548.

Taking the sum of products of payouts times corresponding probabilities we get an expected return of 0.70986492 or roughly 71% for a 6-spot, for a house advantage of 29%. Other spots-played have a similar expected return. This very poor return (for the player) is usually explained by the large overhead (floor space, equipment, personnel) required for the game.

<doc id="180844" wikidata="Q879949" url="?curid=180844" title="Osric of Deira">
<text>Osric (died 633 or 634) was a King of Deira (632–633 or 633–634) in northern England. He was a cousin of king Edwin of Northumbria, being the son of Edwin&#x27;s uncle Æthelric of Deira. Osric was also the father of Oswine.

After Edwin was killed in battle against Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd and Penda of Mercia, Northumbria fell into disarray, with Eanfrith taking power in the sub-kingdom of Bernicia and Osric taking power in Deira. According to Bede, Osric was, like Eanfrith, a Christian who reverted to paganism upon coming to power.

Cadwallon continued his ruinous invasion of Northumbria, however. Bede says that Osric besieged Cadwallon &quot;in a strong town&quot;, but Cadwallon successfully &quot;sallied out on a sudden with all his forces, by surprise, and destroyed him [Osric] and all his army.&quot;

The year in which he and Eanfrith ruled was subsequently deemed so abhorrent because of their paganism that it was decided to add that year to the reign of the Christian Oswald of Bernicia, who defeated Cadwallon and came to rule both Bernicia and Deira, so as to ignore the brief reigns of Osric and Eanfrith.

<doc id="180845" wikidata="Q242605" url="?curid=180845" title="Natalie Maines">
<text>Natalie Louise Maines (born October 14, 1974) is an American musician. She is the lead vocalist for the country band the Chicks.

In 1995, after leaving Berklee College of Music, Maines was recruited by the Dixie Chicks to replace their lead singer, Laura Lynch. With Maines as lead vocalist, the band earned 10 Country Music Association Awards and 13 Grammy Awards for their work between 1998 and 2007.

In 2006, with Maines still acting as lead singer, the Dixie Chicks released &quot;Taking the Long Way&quot;. The album subsequently won five Grammy Awards (including Album of the Year). After dropping the &quot;Dixie&quot;, the Chicks new album &quot;Gaslighter&quot; was released on July 17, 2020. As a solo artist, Maines released the album, &quot;Mother&quot;, on May 7, 2013.

== Early life ==
Maines was born in Lubbock, Texas, to country musician and producer Lloyd Maines and Tina May Maines. She attended Nat Williams Elementary School in Lubbock, where her second grade teacher recalls being told by Maines during a math lesson, &quot;Teacher, I don&#x27;t need to learn this stuff—I&#x27;m gonna be a star.&quot; Maines was a cheerleader while attending O. L. Slaton Junior High School, and graduated in 1992 from Lubbock High School where she had participated in the school choir. Maines has described growing up in conservative Texas, saying &quot;I always rebelled against that. My parents sent me and my sister to public minority schools so I always felt like a hippie and a rebel. ... As a teenager I always loved not thinking in the way I knew the majority of people thought. I always stood up for minorities. ... I&#x27;ve always stood up for homosexuals. I just always had these really strong convictions about doing so.&quot;

Following the completion of high school, Maines attended several colleges. She spent two semesters pursuing an undeclared major at West Texas A&amp;M where her studies focused heavily on radio, then a year and a half at South Plains College. One of Maines&#x27;s instructors at South Plains, and a former member of The Maines Brothers Band, Cary Banks, recalled &quot;She was mostly into rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, rhythm and blues ... alternative rock.&quot; When Banks encountered Maines on campus, he said that she usually needed to vent a little steam. &quot;She would get into a lot of political arguments&quot; at the predominantly Republican school, and was a fan of Texas Governor Ann Richards. &quot;She&#x27;s always been opinionated and hardheaded like her dad.&quot; In December 1994, Maines auditioned for and received a full vocal scholarship to Berklee College of Music. She pursued the diploma program at Berklee but dropped out before the completion of her studies. Even though Maines is from Lubbock, home of Texas Tech University, she attended only one class at the school, a 1995 summer course in &quot;Introductory Wildlife&quot;.

== Career ==
Maines&#x27;s first professional recording was lead vocals on the song &quot;White Women&#x27;s Clothes&quot; on Andy Wilkinson&#x27;s album &quot;Charlie Goodnight&#x27;s Life in Poetry and Song.&quot; Maines&#x27;s first commercially released work was background vocals on Pat Green&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Dancehall Dreamer&quot;, produced by her father Lloyd Maines and released in 1995. At the end of 1995, at age 21, Maines joined the all-female country music band, the then named Dixie Chicks, which had been performing since 1989, but which had been unsuccessful in gaining more than local attention. Maines replaced founding lead singer Laura Lynch. She plays guitar and bass in concert in the band.

Maines co-wrote four tracks for The Chicks&#x27; first three albums, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart number one hit &quot;Without You&quot; on &quot;Fly&quot;. Maines was a primary songwriter on all 14 tracks of the band&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Taking the Long Way&quot; which peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at No. 1. &quot;Taking the Long Way&quot; has the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 single &quot;Not Ready to Make Nice&quot;, (Maines, Strayer, Erwin, Wilson) hitting No. 4 and for which the band won the songwriting Grammy Award, for Song of the Year. Maines considers the songwriting she did for &quot;Taking the Long Way&quot; &quot;pure therapy&quot; after the controversy that ensued over a comment Maines made from the stage in London that criticized U.S. President George W. Bush. &quot;Everything felt more personal this time&quot;, Maines said about the album, &quot;there&#x27;s just more maturity, depth, intelligence. ... [These songs] feel more grown-up.&quot;

Maines collaborates with other musical artists, both as a member of the Chicks and an individual singer. The Chicks first worked with Sheryl Crow in 1999 while performing for the concert tour Lilith Fair. Since then, the Chicks have worked with Crow on her &quot;Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live from Central Park&quot; album, a Crow remixed version of &quot;Landslide&quot; performed by the Chicks, and the Chicks&#x27; song &quot;Favorite Year&quot; from &quot;Taking the Long Way&quot;. Maines has performed with artists including Pat Green, Charlie Robison, Yellowcard, Stevie Nicks, Patty Griffin, Neil Diamond, Eddie Vedder, Pete Yorn and Ben Harper.

On May 7, 2013, Maines released a solo album entitled &quot;Mother&quot;. This was Maines&#x27;s first album since the Chicks hiatus started in 2007. The album was co-produced by Ben Harper. The album contains Maines&#x27;s interpretation of several cover songs, including Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Mother&quot;, Eddie Vedder&#x27;s &quot;Without You&quot;, and Jeff Buckley&#x27;s &quot;Lover, You Should&#x27;ve Come Over&quot;. She also sings about motherhood, feminism, and painful relationships.

In September 2015, Maines was inducted into the West Texas Walk of Fame. The ceremony took place at Lubbock High School from where she graduated in 1992.

== Philanthropic works ==
Maines has participated in various fundraising and awareness events. They include:
* Legendary Bingo (August 23, 2007): Maines participated in &quot;Legendary Bingo&quot;, a US bingo game hosted by drag queens and held weekly in Los Angeles. Proceeds from the event go to special charity interests; when Maines participated in the event, the proceeds benefited the &quot;Voice for the Animals Foundation&quot;.
* St. Jude Benefit (June 12, 2008): Maines attended &quot;Scrabble Under The Stars&quot; in Beverly Hills, California. The event benefits St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital. Scrabble boards autographed by celebrity attendees, including Maines, were auctioned through June 30, 2008.
* David Lynch Foundation: Maines with the Dixie Chicks was the headline performer at a benefit night honoring Rick Rubin at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in February 2014.

== Personal life ==

In 1997, Maines married her South Plains College boyfriend, bassist Michael Tarabay, and the couple moved to Nashville, Tennessee. Within two years they filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.

Maines met actor Adrian Pasdar in May 1999 at the wedding of bandmate Emily Erwin to Charlie Robison. Maines and Pasdar married on June 24, 2000, at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. They have two sons. During her marriage, Maines referred to herself as Natalie Pasdar. Maines filed for divorce in July 2017; it was finalized in December 2019. The events leading to her divorce inspired multiple songs on the 2020 album &quot;Gaslighter&quot;.

Maines practices transcendental meditation.

== Controversies ==

=== Iraq War criticism and aftermath ===

On March 10, 2003, nine days before the invasion of Iraq, the Dixie Chicks performed at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire theater in London, England, UK. It was the first concert of their Top of the World Tour in support of their sixth album, &quot;Home.&quot; Introducing their song &quot;Travelin&#x27; Soldier&quot;, Maines told the audience the band they did not support the upcoming Allied invasion of Iraq and were &quot;ashamed&quot; that President George W. Bush was from Texas.

Many American country music listeners supported the war, and Maines&#x27;s remark triggered a backlash in the United States. The Dixie Chicks were blacklisted by thousands of country radio stations, and the band members received death threats. Maines issued an apology, saying her remark had been disrespectful; in 2006 she rescinded the apology, saying she felt Bush deserved no respect. The backlash damaged sales of their music and sales of their next album and tour.
At the first US concert after Maines&#x27;s comment, she said from the stage, &quot;They told me that you may not come, but I knew you&#x27;d come because we have the greatest fans in the whole wide world.&quot; Despite fan turnout at concerts, the Dixie Chicks began receiving death threats as circulation of the comment increased. Subsequently, security was heightened at all concert venues and metal detectors were installed where possible. A death threat directed at Maines was received prior to the Dixie Chicks&#x27; concert of July 6, 2003, in Dallas, Texas. Maines described the threat as &quot;scary because ... it wasn&#x27;t just somebody wanting to write a hate letter. ... It was somebody who obviously thought they had a plan.&quot; Security was heightened for the trip to and from the concert venue as well as at the arena.

On May 21, 2006, while promoting the release of the album &quot;Taking the Long Way&quot;, Maines recanted her 2003 apology to President Bush, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel that way anymore. I don&#x27;t feel he is owed any respect whatsoever. ... If people are going to ask me to apologize based on who I am ... I don&#x27;t know what to do about that. I can&#x27;t change who I am.&quot;

Maines says she is not looking for more battles but that &quot;The Incident,&quot; as it is referred to by the Dixie Chicks, reminded her of how she &quot;felt in high school: to be angry, to be sure that you&#x27;re right and that the things you do matter. You don&#x27;t realize that you&#x27;re not feeling those feelings until you do. And then you realize how much more interesting life is.&quot;

Two 2006 documentaries, &quot;Protesting the Dixie Chicks&quot; and &quot;Shut Up And Sing&quot;, deal with the controversy surrounding Maines&#x27;s comment and the ensuing fallout. In an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; on June 15, 2006, regarding the fallout from her comment, Maines again stirred up controversy by stating:The entire country may disagree with me, but I don&#x27;t understand the necessity for patriotism; Why do you have to be a patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where you live and like your life, but as for loving the whole country ... I don&#x27;t see why people care about patriotism.

In 2007, the Dixie Chicks won three Grammys for &quot;Not Ready to Make Nice&quot; and two Grammys for &quot;Taking the Long Way&quot;, receiving all five Grammys for which they were nominated. This was seen by some as vindication for the Dixie Chicks, who were shunned by country radio programmers after Maines&#x27;s remarks about President Bush. As the Dixie Chicks accepted the album of the year award, Maines said, &quot;I think people are using their freedom of speech with all these awards. We get the message.&quot;

=== Feud with Toby Keith ===
Maines had a public feud with fellow country music superstar Toby Keith over the 2002 chart-topping country hit &quot;Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue&quot;, as well as a comment Maines made about U.S. President George W. Bush during a March 2003 Dixie Chicks concert in London.

Maines publicly criticized Keith&#x27;s song &quot;Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue&quot; by saying, &quot;I hate it. It&#x27;s ignorant, and it makes country music sound ignorant. It targets an entire culture—and not just the bad people who did bad things. You&#x27;ve got to have some tact. Anybody can write, &#x27;We&#x27;ll put a boot in your ass.&#x27;&quot; Keith responded by belittling Maines&#x27;s songwriting skills with, &quot;I&#x27;ll bury her. She has never written anything that has been a hit&quot; and, &quot;That&#x27;s what I do—I write songs.&quot;

After Maines commented at a March 2003 Dixie Chicks concert at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire theatre in London that the Dixie Chicks didn&#x27;t want the Iraq War and were &quot;ashamed&quot; President Bush &quot;was from Texas&quot;, Keith&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Shock&#x27;n Y&#x27;all&quot; tour began displaying a backdrop showing a doctored photo of Maines with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Shortly thereafter, on May 21, 2003, Maines wore a T-shirt with the letters &quot;F.U.T.K.&quot; written on the front while performing for the Academy of Country Music Awards broadcast. The Dixie Chicks website stated that the letters stood for &quot;Freedom, United, Together in Kindness&quot;. Many in the country music industry saw it as a veiled insult directed at Keith. The audience at the award show also booed the Dixie Chicks numerous times, the loudest being when their nomination for the Entertainer of the Year award was read out, Toby Keith subsequently won the award. 

In the 2006 documentary &quot;Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing&quot;, backstage footage prior to her appearance wearing the F.U.T.K. shirt recorded the conversation between Maines and Simon Renshaw and confirmed that the original intent of the shirt was in response to Keith&#x27;s criticism of her: the letters stood for &quot;Fuck You Toby Keith&quot;. As of January 2007, Keith continued to refuse to say Maines&#x27;s name and argues that the doctored photos displayed during his concerts were intended to express his feeling that Maines&#x27;s criticism was tyrannical and a dictator-like attempt to squelch Keith&#x27;s free speech.

=== West Memphis Three lawsuit ===
Maines and other members of The Dixie Chicks participated in a rally in Little Rock, Arkansas, in late 2007, in support of the West Memphis Three, three imprisoned men convicted of the 1993 murder of three young boys in West Memphis, Arkansas. On August 19, 2011, Maines joined with Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder in Jonesboro, Arkansas, supporting the release of the West Memphis Three.

<doc id="180846" wikidata="Q1747582" url="?curid=180846" title="Federal Reserve Note">
<text>Federal Reserve Notes are the currently issued banknotes of the United States dollar. The United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing produces the notes under the authority of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and issues them to the Federal Reserve Banks at the discretion of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Reserve Banks then circulate the notes to their member banks, at which point they become liabilities of the Reserve Banks and obligations of the United States.

Federal Reserve Notes are legal tender, with the words &quot;this note is legal tender for all debts, public and private&quot; printed on each note. The notes are backed by financial assets that the Federal Reserve Banks pledge as collateral, which are mainly Treasury securities and mortgage agency securities that they purchase on the open market by fiat payment.

==History==
Following the enactment of the Constitution, states began chartering commercial banks that issued their own notes. These notes were known as state bank notes. State bank notes did not achieve widespread acceptance outside of their state of issue. The first institution to issue notes with national acceptance in the U.S. was the nationally chartered First Bank of the United States, chartered in 1791 by Alexander Hamilton. Its charter was not renewed in 1811. In 1816, the Second Bank of the United States was chartered and its notes also acquired widespread acceptance; its charter was not renewed in 1836, after President Andrew Jackson campaigned heavily for its disestablishment. From 1837 to 1862, in the Free Banking Era, state bank notes were the only circulating paper currency again. From 1862 to 1913, a system of national banks was instituted by the 1863 National Banking Act. Banks authorized under this act were known as National Banks and issued their own National Bank Notes. These did achieve national acceptance but the U.S. still lacked a central bank. It wasn&#x27;t until the passage of the Federal Reserve Act that the United States finally had an institution that issued nationally accepted bank notes and had the powers of a central bank.

Federal Reserve Notes have been printed from Series 1914 in large-note format, and from Series 1928 in modern-day (small-note) format. The latter dimensions originated from the size of the Philippine peso Silver Certificates issued in 1903 while William Howard Taft served as Philippine governor-general under the United States colonial administration. In view of its highly successful run, President Taft subsequently appointed a committee that reported favorably on the advantages and savings from adopting the dimensions of Philippine notes for use in the United States. Final implementation of today&#x27;s small-size format, however, only occurred in 1928.

==Value==
The authority of the Federal Reserve Banks to issue notes comes from the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Legally, they are liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks and obligations of the United States government. Although not issued by the United States Treasury, Federal Reserve Notes carry the (engraved) signature of the Treasurer of the United States and the United States Secretary of the Treasury.

At the time of the Federal Reserve&#x27;s creation, the law provided for notes to be redeemed to the Treasury in gold or &quot;lawful money.&quot; The latter category was not explicitly defined, but included United States Notes, National Bank Notes, and certain other notes held by banks to meet reserve requirements, such as clearing certificates. The Emergency Banking Act of 1933 removed the gold obligation and authorized the Treasury to satisfy these redemption demands with current notes of equal face value (effectively making change). Under the Bretton Woods system, although citizens could not legally possess gold (except as rare coins, jewelry, for industrial purposes, etc.), the federal government continued to maintain a stable international gold price. This system ended with the Nixon Shock of 1971. Present-day Federal Reserve Notes are not backed by convertibility to any specific commodity, but only by the collateral assets that Federal Reserve Banks post in order to obtain them.

==Production and distribution==
A commercial bank that maintains a reserve account with the Federal Reserve can obtain notes from the Federal Reserve Bank in its district whenever it wishes. The bank must pay the face value of the notes by debiting (drawing down) its reserve account. Smaller banks without a reserve account at the Federal Reserve can maintain their reserve accounts at larger &quot;correspondent banks&quot; which themselves maintain reserve accounts with the Federal Reserve.

Federal Reserve Notes are printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), a bureau of the Department of the Treasury. When Federal Reserve Banks require additional notes for circulation, they must post collateral in the form of direct federal obligations, private bank obligations, or assets purchased through open market operations. If the notes are newly printed, they also pay the BEP for the cost of printing (about 4¢ per note). This differs from the issue of coins, which are purchased for their face value.

A Federal Reserve Bank can retire notes that return from circulation, which entitles it to recover collateral that it posted for an earlier issue. Retired notes in good condition are held in the bank&#x27;s vault for future issues. Notes in poor condition are destroyed and replacements are ordered from the BEP. The Federal Reserve shreds 7,000 tons of worn out currency each year.

As of 2018, Federal Reserve notes remain, on average, in circulation for the following periods of time:

The Federal Reserve does not publish an average life span for the $2 bill. This is likely due to its treatment as a collector&#x27;s item by the general public; it is, therefore, not subjected to normal circulation.

Starting with the Series 1996 $100 note, bills $5 and above have a special letter in addition to the prefix letters which range from A to Q. The first letter is A for Series 1996, B for Series 1999, C for Series 2001, D for Series 2003, F for Series 2003A, H for Series 2006, K for Series 2006A, J for Series 2009, M for Series 2013, N for Series 2017, P for Series 2017A, and Q for series 2021. 

The Series 2004 $20, the first note in the second redesign, has kept the element of the special double prefix. The first letter is E for Series 2004, G for Series 2004A, I for Series 2006, J for Series 2009, L for Series 2009A, and M for Series 2013.

Federal Reserve Notes are made of 75% cotton and 25% linen fibers, supplied by Crane Currency of Dalton, Massachusetts specifically for that purpose.

==Nicknames==
U.S. paper currency has had many nicknames and slang terms. The notes themselves are generally referred to as &quot;bills&quot; (as in &quot;five-dollar bill&quot;). Notes can be referred to by the first or last name of the person on the portrait (George for one dollar, or even more popularly, &quot;Benjamins&quot; for $100 notes).

* Greenbacks, any amount in any denomination of Federal Reserve Note (from the green ink used on the back). The Demand Notes issued in 1861 had green-inked backs, and the Federal Reserve Note of 1914 copied this pattern.
* &quot;Buck&quot; for a one-dollar bill.
* &quot;Fin&quot; is a slang term for a five-dollar bill, from Yiddish &quot;finf&quot; meaning five.
* &quot;Sawbuck&quot; is a slang term for a ten-dollar bill, from the image of the Roman numeral X and its resemblance to the carpentry implement.
* &quot;Double sawbuck&quot; is slang term for a twenty-dollar bill, from the image of the Roman numeral XX.
* One hundred dollar bills are sometimes called &quot;Benjamins&quot; (in reference to their portrait of Benjamin Franklin) or &quot;C-Notes&quot; (the letter &quot;C&quot; is the Roman numeral 100).
* &quot;Dead presidents&quot;, referring to the portraits that feature on the front of each bill. (This colloquialism is partially incorrect; neither Alexander Hamilton nor Benjamin Franklin, who appear on the ten-dollar and one hundred-dollar bills respectively, ever served as president of the United States.)

==Criticisms==
===Security===
Despite the relatively late addition of color and other anti-counterfeiting features to U.S. currency, critics hold that it is still a straightforward matter to counterfeit these bills. They point out that the ability to reproduce color images is well within the capabilities of modern color printers, most of which are affordable to many consumers. These critics suggest that the Federal Reserve should incorporate holographic features, as are used in most other major currencies, such as the pound sterling, Canadian dollar and euro banknotes, which are more difficult and expensive to forge. Another robust technology, the polymer banknote, was developed for the Australian dollar and adopted for the New Zealand dollar, Romanian leu, Papua New Guinea kina, Canadian dollar, and other circulating, as well as commemorative, banknotes of a number of other countries. They are said to be more secure, cleaner, and more durable than paper notes, but U.S. banknotes are already designed to be more durable than traditional cotton-based banknotes, seeing as they are 25% linen. One major issue with implementing these or any new counterfeiting countermeasures, however, is that (other than under Executive Order 6102 as well as the demonetization of Trade Dollars in 1876) the United States has never demonetized or required a mandatory exchange of any existing currency. Consequently, would-be counterfeiters can easily circumvent any new security features simply by counterfeiting older designs, although once a new design is launched, the older designs are usually withdrawn from circulation as they cycle through the Federal Reserve Banks.

U.S. currency does, however, bear several anti-counterfeiting features. Two of the most critical anti-counterfeiting features of U.S. currency are the paper and the ink. The ink and paper combine to create a distinct texture, particularly as the currency is circulated. The paper and the ink alone have no effect on the value of the dollar until post print. These characteristics can be hard to duplicate without the proper equipment and materials. Furthermore, recent redesigns of the $5, $10, $20, and $50 notes have added EURion constellation patterns which allows scanning software to recognize banknotes and refuse to scan them.

The differing sizes of other nations&#x27; banknotes is a security feature that eliminates one form of counterfeiting to which U.S. currency is prone: Counterfeiters can simply bleach the ink off a low-denomination note, such as a $1 or $5 bill, and reprint it as a higher-value note, such as a $100 bill. To counter this, the U.S. government has included in all $5 and higher denominated notes since the 1990 series a security thread, which is a vertical laminate strip imprinted with denomination information. Under ultraviolet light, the security thread fluoresces a different color for each denomination ($5 note: blue; $10 note: orange; $20 note: green; $50 note: yellow; $100 note: pink). Additionally the newly designed $100 launched in 2013 has a 3D security ribbon which has proven to be highly resistant to counterfeiting, yet easily understood by the public without special tools or lights.

According to the central banks, the number of counterfeited banknotes seized annually is about 10 in one million real bank notes for the Swiss franc, 50 in one million for the Euro, 100 in one million for United States dollar and 300 in one million for pound sterling (old style).

===Differentiation===
Critics, such as the American Council of the Blind, note that U.S. bills are relatively hard to tell apart: they use very similar designs, they are printed in the same colors (until the 2003 banknotes, in which a faint secondary color was added), and they are all the same size. The American Council of the Blind has argued that American paper currency design should use increasing sizes according to value or raised or indented features to make the currency more usable by the vision-impaired, since the denominations cannot currently be distinguished from one another non-visually. Use of Braille codes on currency is not considered a desirable solution because these markings would only be useful to people who know how to read Braille, and one Braille symbol can become confused with another if even one bump is rubbed off. Though some blind individuals say that they have no problems keeping track of their currency because they fold their bills in different ways or keep them in different places in their wallets, they nevertheless must rely on sighted people or currency-counting machines to determine the value of each bill before filing it away using the system of their choice. This means that no matter how organized they are, blind people still have to trust sighted people or machines each time they receive U.S. banknotes.

By contrast, other major currencies, such as the pound sterling and euro, feature notes of differing sizes: the size of the note increases with the denomination and different denominations are printed in different, contrasting colors. This is useful not only for the vision-impaired; they nearly eliminate the risk that, for example, someone might fail to notice a high-value note among low-value ones.

Multiple currency sizes were considered for U.S. currency, but makers of vending and change machines successfully argued that implementing such a wide range of sizes would greatly increase the cost and complexity of such machines. Similar arguments were unsuccessfully made in Europe prior to the introduction of multiple note sizes.

Alongside the contrasting colors and increasing sizes, many other countries&#x27; currencies contain tactile features missing from U.S. banknotes to assist the blind. For example, Canadian banknotes have a series of raised dots (not Braille) in the upper right corner to indicate denomination. Mexican peso banknotes also have raised patterns of dashed lines. The Indian rupee has raised patterns of different shapes printed for various denominations on the left of the watermark window (20: vertical rectangle; 50: square; 100: triangle; 500: circle; 1,000: diamond).

====Lawsuit over U.S. banknote design====
Ruling on a lawsuit filed in 2002 (&quot;American Council of the Blind v. Paulson&quot;), on November 28, 2006, U.S. District Judge James Robertson ruled that the American bills gave an undue burden to the blind and denied them &quot;meaningful access&quot; to the U.S. currency system. In his ruling, Robertson noted that the United States was the only nation out of 180 issuing paper currency that printed bills that were identical in size and color in all their denominations and that the successful use of such features as varying sizes, raised lettering and tiny perforations used by other nations is evidence that the ordered changes are feasible. The plaintiff&#x27;s attorney was quoted as saying &quot;It&#x27;s just frankly unfair that blind people should have to rely on the good faith of people they have never met in knowing whether they&#x27;ve been given the correct change.&quot; Government attorneys estimated that the cost of such a change ranges from $75 million in equipment upgrades and $9 million annual expenses for punching holes in bills to $178 million in one-time charges and $50 million annual expenses for printing bills of varying sizes.

Robertson accepted the plaintiff&#x27;s argument that current practice violates Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The judge ordered the United States Department of the Treasury to begin working on a redesign within 30 days,
but the Treasury appealed the decision.

On May 20, 2008, in a 2-to-1 decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the earlier ruling, pointing out that the cost estimates were inflated and that the burdens on blind and visually impaired currency users had not been adequately addressed.

On October 3, 2008, on remand from the D.C. Circuit, D.C. District Court Judge Robertson granted the injunction.

As a result of the court&#x27;s injunction, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is planning to implement a raised tactile feature in the next redesign of each note, except the $1 bill (which is not allowed to be redesigned under a 2015 law), though the version of the $100 bill already is in progress. It also plans larger, higher-contrast numerals, more color differences, and distribution of currency readers to assist the visually impaired during the transition period. The Bureau received a comprehensive study on accessibility options in July 2009, and solicited public comments from May to August 2010.

The 2013 redesign of the $100 bill did not include distinguishing features for the blind. As of October 2022, the plan was to incorporate accessibility features into distributions of a new $10 bill in 2026, $50 bill in 2028, $20 bill in 2030 followed later by a new $5 then $100 notes later in the 2030s.

==Legal authorizations for currency, and limitations on design==
The Secretary of the Treasury is charged with the obligation to produce currency and bonds. 31 U.S.C. § 5114. Treasury Department regulations further specify the quality of paper and ink to be used. 31 C.F.R. Part 601. The denominations and design of currency are not further specified by law; for example, the choice of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100, and the portraits on each, are largely left to the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury.

There are few requirements set by Congress. The national motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; must appear on all U.S. currency and coins. Though the motto had periodically appeared on coins since 1865, it did not appear on currency (other than interest-bearing notes in 1861) until a law passed in 1956 required it. It began to appear on Federal Reserve Notes delivered from 1964 to 1966, depending on denomination.

The portraits appearing on the U.S. currency can feature only people who have died, whose names should be included below each of the portraits. Since the standardization of the bills in 1928, the Department of the Treasury has chosen to feature the same portraits on the bills. These portraits were decided upon in 1929 by a committee appointed by the Treasury. Originally, the committee had decided to feature U.S. presidents because they were more familiar to the public than other potential candidates. The Treasury altered this decision, however, to include three statesmen who were also well known to the public: Alexander Hamilton (the first Secretary of the Treasury who appears on the $10 bill), Benjamin Franklin (an early advocate of paper currency who appears on the $100 bill), and Salmon P. Chase (the Secretary of the Treasury who reintroduced national paper currency and appeared on the obsolete $10,000 bill) In 2016, the Treasury announced a number of design changes to the $5, $10 and $20 bills; to be introduced over the next ten years. The redesigns include:

* The back of the $5 bill will be changed to showcase historical events at the pictured Lincoln Memorial by adding portraits of Marian Anderson (due to her famous performance there after being barred from Constitution Hall because of her race), Martin Luther King Jr. (due to his famous I Have A Dream speech), and Eleanor Roosevelt (who arranged Anderson&#x27;s performance).
* The back of the $10 bill will be changed to show a 1913 march for women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States, plus portraits of Sojourner Truth, Lucretia Mott, Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
* On the $20 bill, Andrew Jackson will move to the back (reduced in size, alongside the White House) and Harriet Tubman will appear on the front.

After an unsuccessful attempt in the proposed Legal Tender Modernization Act of 2001, the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 required that none of the funds set aside for either the Treasury or the Bureau of Engraving and Printing may be used to redesign the $1 bill. This is because any change would affect vending machines and the risk of counterfeiting is low for this small denomination. This superseded the Federal Reserve Act (Section 16, Paragraph 8) which gives the Treasury permission to redesign any banknote to prevent counterfeiting.

==Series==
Notes issued prior to 1928 were . Per the Treasury Department Appropriation Bill of 1929, notes issued after 1928 were to be , which allowed the Treasury Department to produce 12 notes per sheet of paper that previously would yield 8 notes at the old size.

Modern measurements of these large size notes reveal an average dimension of . Small size notes (described as such due to their size relative to the earlier large-size notes) are an average , the size of modern U.S. currency. Each measurement is ± to account for margins and cutting. (Note: differences in size may also involve in historical changes in the definition of the inch.)

===Large size notes===
Series 1914 FRN were the first of two large-size issues. Denominations were $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 printed first with a red seal and then continued with a blue seal. Series 1918 notes were issued in $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 denominations. The latter two denominations exist only in institutional collections. Series 1914 and 1918 notes in the following two tables are from the National Numismatic Collection at the National Museum of American History (Smithsonian Institution).

===Series 2004–present (color notes)===
Beginning in 2003, the Federal Reserve introduced a new series of bills, featuring images of national symbols of freedom. The new $20 bill was first issued on October 9, 2003; the new $50 on September 28, 2004; the new $10 bill on March 2, 2006; the new $5 bill on March 13, 2008; the new $100 bill on October 8, 2013. The one and two dollar bills still remain small portrait, unchanged, and not watermarked.

<text>A United States Note, also known as a Legal Tender Note, is a type of paper money that was issued from 1862 to 1971 in the United States. Having been current for 109 years, they were issued for longer than any other form of U.S. paper money other than the currently issued Federal Reserve Note. They were known popularly as &quot;greenbacks&quot;, a name inherited from the earlier greenbacks, the Demand Notes, that they replaced in 1862. Often termed Legal Tender Notes, they were named United States Notes by the First Legal Tender Act, which authorized them as a form of fiat currency. During the early 1860s the so-called &quot;second obligation&quot; on the reverse of the notes stated:

By the 1930s, this obligation would eventually be shortened to:

They were originally issued directly into circulation by the U.S. Treasury to pay expenses incurred by the Union during the American Civil War. During the next century, the legislation governing these notes was modified many times and numerous versions were issued by the Treasury.

United States Notes that were issued in the large-size format, before 1929, differ dramatically in appearance when compared to modern American currency, but those issued in the small-size format, starting 1929, are very similar to contemporary Federal Reserve Notes of the same denominations with the distinction of having red U.S. Treasury Seals and serial numbers in place of green ones. Also, while a variety of denominations were issued as United States Notes during the large-size era, only the $1, $2, $5, and $100 denominations were ever issued as small-size notes.

Existing United States Notes are still fully usable and are considered legal tender. However, as no United States Notes have been issued since January 1971, all issues have all but disappeared from circulation, and command higher prices than face value as items of numismatic interest.

==History==
===Demand Notes===
During 1861, the first year of the American Civil War, the expenses incurred by the Union Government much exceeded its limited revenues from taxation, and borrowing was the main vehicle for financing the war. The Act of July 17, 1861 authorized United States Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase to raise money via the issuance of $50,000,000 in Treasury Notes payable on demand. These Demand Notes were paid to creditors directly and used to meet the payroll of soldiers in the field. While issued within the legal framework of Treasury Note Debt, the Demand Notes were intended to circulate as currency and were of the same size as banknotes and closely resembled them in appearance. During December 1861, economic conditions deteriorated and a suspension of specie payment caused the government to cease redeeming the Demand Notes as coins.

===The Legal Tender Acts===

The beginning of 1862 found the Union&#x27;s expenses increasing, and the government was having trouble funding the escalating war. U.S. Demand Notes—which were used, among other things, to pay Union soldiers—were unredeemable, and the value of the notes began to deteriorate. Congressman and Buffalo banker Elbridge G. Spaulding prepared a bill, based on the Free Banking Law of New York, that eventually became the National Banking Act of 1863.

Recognizing, however, that his proposal would take many months to pass Congress, during early February Spaulding introduced another bill to permit the U.S. Treasury to issue million in notes as legal tender. This caused tremendous controversy in Congress, as hitherto the Constitution had been interpreted as not granting the government the power to issue a paper currency. &quot;The bill before us is a war measure, a measure of &quot;necessity&quot;, and not of choice,&quot; Spaulding argued before the House, adding, &quot;These are extraordinary times, and extraordinary measures must be resorted to in order to save our Government, and preserve our nationality.&quot; Spaulding justified the action as a &quot;&quot;necessary means&quot; of carrying into execution the powers granted in the Constitution &#x27;to raise and &quot;support&quot; armies&#x27;, and &#x27;to provide and &quot;maintain&quot; a navy. Despite strong opposition, President Abraham Lincoln signed the First Legal Tender Act, enacted February 25, 1862, into law, authorizing the issuance of United States Notes as a legal tender—the paper currency soon to be known as &quot;greenbacks&quot;.

Initially, the emission was limited to total face value between the new Legal Tender Notes and the existing Demand Notes. The Act also intended for the new notes to be used to replace the Demand Notes as soon as practical. The Demand Notes had been issued in denominations of $5, $10, and $20, and these were replaced by United States Notes nearly identical in appearance on the obverse. In addition, notes of entirely new design were introduced in denominations of $50, $100, $500 and. The Demand Notes&#x27; printed promise of payment &quot;On Demand&quot; was removed and the statement &quot;This Note is a Legal Tender&quot; was added.

Legal tender status guaranteed that creditors would have to accept the notes despite the fact that they were not backed by gold, bank deposits, or government reserves, and had no interest. However, the First Legal Tender Act did not make the notes an &quot;unlimited legal tender&quot; as they could not be used by merchants to pay customs duties on imports and could not be used by the government to pay interest on its bonds. The Act did provide that the notes be receivable by the government for short term deposits at 5% interest, and for the purchase of 6% interest 20-year bonds at par. The rationale for these terms was that the Union government would preserve its credit-worthiness by supporting the value of its bonds by paying their interest in gold. Early in the war, customs duties were a large part of government tax revenue and by making these payable in gold, the government would generate the coin necessary to make the interest payments on the bonds. Lastly, by making the bonds available for purchase at par in United States Notes, the value of the latter would be confirmed as well. The limitations of the legal tender status were quite controversial. Thaddeus Stevens, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee of Ways and Means, which had authored an earlier version of the Legal Tender Act that would have made United States Notes a legal tender for &quot;all&quot; debts, denounced the exceptions, calling the new bill &quot;mischievous&quot; because it made United States Notes an intentionally depreciated currency for the masses, while the banks who loaned to the government got &quot;sound money&quot; in gold. This controversy would continue until the removal of the exceptions during 1933.

By the First Legal Tender Act, Congress limited the Treasury&#x27;s emission of United States Notes to ; however, by 1863, the Second Legal Tender Act, enacted July 11, 1862, a Joint Resolution of Congress, and the Third Legal Tender Act, enacted March 3, 1863, had expanded the limit to , the option to exchange the notes for United States bonds at par had been revoked, and notes of $1 and $2 denominations had been introduced as the appearance of fiat currency had per Gresham&#x27;s law driven even silver coinage out of circulation. As a result of this inflation, the greenback began to trade at a substantial discount from gold, which prompted Congress to pass the short-lived Anti-Gold Futures Act of 1864, which was soon repealed after it seemed to accelerate the decrease of greenback value.

The largest amount of greenbacks outstanding at any one time was calculated as . The Union&#x27;s reliance on expanding the circulation of greenbacks eventually ended with the emission of Interest Bearing and Compound Interest Treasury Notes, and the passage of the National Banking Act. However, the end of the war found the greenbacks trading for only about half of their nominal value in gold. The Secret Service was founded on July 5, 1865, to minimize counterfeiting, which accounted for up to half of the currency.

===Post Civil War===

At the end of the American Civil War, some economists, such as Henry Charles Carey, argued for building on the precedent of non-interest-based fiat money and making the greenback system permanent. However, Secretary of the Treasury McCulloch argued that the Legal Tender Acts had been war measures, and that the United States should soon reverse them and return to the gold standard. The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to endorse the Secretary&#x27;s argument. With an eventual return to gold convertibility in mind, the Funding Act of April 12, 1866 was passed, authorizing McCulloch to retire million of the Greenbacks within six months and up to million per month thereafter. This he proceeded to do until only were outstanding during February 1868. By this time, the wartime economic prosperity was ended, the crop harvest was poor, and a financial panic in Great Britain caused a recession and a sharp decrease of prices in the United States. The contraction of the money supply was blamed for the deflationary effects, and caused debtors to agitate successfully for a halt to the notes&#x27; retirement.

During the early 1870s, Treasury Secretaries George S. Boutwell and William Adams Richardson maintained that, though Congress had mandated as the minimum Greenback circulation, the old Civil War statutes still authorized a maximum of —and thus they had at their discretion a &quot;reserve&quot; of . While the Senate Finance Committee under John Sherman disagreed, being of the opinion that the was a maximum as well as a minimum, no legislation was passed to assert the committee&#x27;s opinion. Starting in 1872, Boutwell and Richardson used the &quot;reserve&quot; to counteract seasonal demands for currency, and eventually expanded the circulation of the Greenbacks to in response to the Panic of 1873.

In June 1874, Congress established a maximum for Greenback circulation of , and in January 1875, approved the Specie Payment Resumption Act, which authorized a reduction of the circulation of Greenbacks towards a revised limit of , and required the government to redeem them for gold, on demand, after January 1, 1879. As a result, the currency strengthened and by April 1876, the notes were on par with silver coins which then began to re-emerge into circulation. On May 31, 1878, the contraction in the circulation was halted at —a level which would be maintained for almost 100 years afterwards. While was a significant figure at the time, it is now a very small fraction of the total currency in circulation in the United States. The year 1879 found Sherman, now Secretary of the Treasury, in possession of sufficient specie to redeem notes as requested, but as this brought the value of the greenbacks into parity with gold for the first time since the Specie Suspension of December 1861, the public voluntarily accepted the greenbacks as part of the circulating medium.

While the United States Notes had been used as a form of debt issuance during the Civil War, afterwards they were used as a way of moderately influencing the money supply by the federal government—such as through the actions of Boutwell and Richardson. During the Panic of 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt attempted to increase liquidity in the markets by authorizing the Treasury to issue more Greenbacks, but the Aldrich–Vreeland Act provided for the needed flexibility by the National Bank Note supply instead. Eventually, the perceived need for an elastic currency was addressed with the Federal Reserve Notes authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and attempts to alter the circulating quantity of United States Notes ended.

===End of the United States Note===

Soon after private ownership of gold was banned in 1933 (a ban that would be lifted in 1974), all of the remaining types of circulating currency, National Bank Notes, silver certificates, Federal Reserve Notes, and United States Notes, were redeemable by individuals only for silver. Eventually, even silver redemption stopped in June 1968, during a time in which all U.S. currency (both coins and paper currency) was changed to fiat currency. For the general public, there was then little to distinguish United States Notes from Federal Reserve Notes. As a result, the public circulation of United States Notes, in the form of and bills was discontinued in August 1966, and replaced with Federal Reserve Notes and, eventually, Federal Reserve Notes as well. United States Notes became rare in hand-to-hand commerce and also beginning in 1966, the Treasury converted the outstanding balance into new United States Notes, the majority of which sat unissued in bank vaults. Series 1966 and Series 1966A United States Notes were printed from 1966 to 1969, with distribution into public circulation officially ending January 21, 1971.

In September 1994, the Riegle Improvement Act released the Treasury from its long-standing obligation to keep United States Notes in circulation. Just prior to the Riegle act, the Treasury considered releasing its large remaining stockpile of unissued United States Notes into general circulation, but with the recently redesigned series 1996 Federal Reserve Note, it was decided confusion would likely arise with the sudden appearance of two very different notes in circulation. The Treasury announced in 1996 that the remaining stock of United States Notes had been destroyed.

==Comparison to Federal Reserve Notes==
Both United States Notes and Federal Reserve Notes have been legal tender since the gold recall of 1933. Both have been used in circulation as money in the same way. However, the issuing authority for them came from different statutes. United States Notes are, depending on their issue, redeemable directly for precious metal – as after the specie resumption of 1879 which authorized federal officials to do so if requested. The difference between a United States Note and a Federal Reserve Note is that a United States Note represented a &quot;bill of credit&quot; and, since it was issued by the government itself and does not involve either lending or borrowing, was inserted by the Treasury directly into circulation free of interest. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks issue them into circulation pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. A commercial bank belonging to the Federal Reserve System can obtain Federal Reserve Notes from the Federal Reserve Bank in its district whenever it wishes. It must pay for them in full, dollar for dollar, by drawing down its account with its district Federal Reserve Bank.

==Characteristics==

Like all U.S. currency, United States Notes were produced in a large sized format until 1929, at which time the notes&#x27; sizes were reduced to the small-size format of the present day. Per the Treasury Department Appropriation Bill of 1929, notes issued before October 1928 were inches and later issues were to be inches, which allowed the Treasury Department to produce 12 notes per inch sheet of paper that previously would yield 8 notes at the old size.

The original large-sized Civil War issues were dated 1862 and 1863, and issued in denominations of , , , , , , , and . The United States Notes were dramatically redesigned for the Series of 1869, the so-called &quot;Rainbow Notes&quot;. The notes were again redesigned for the Series of 1874, 1875 and 1878. The Series of 1878 included, for the first and last time, notes of and denominations. The final across-the-board redesign of the large-sized notes was the Series of 1880. Individual denominations were redesigned in 1901, 1907, 1917 and 1923.

On small-sized United States Notes, the U.S. Treasury Seal and the serial numbers are printed in red (contrasting with Federal Reserve Notes, where they appear in green). By the time the treasury adopted the small-size format in 1928, the Federal Reserve System had existed for fifteen years and there had been a decline in the need for United States Notes; the notes were mainly issued in and denominations in the Series years of 1928, 1953, and 1963. There was a limited issue of notes in the Series of 1928, most of which were released in 1948 in Puerto Rico, and an issue of notes in the Series year of 1966, mainly to satisfy the legacy legal requirement of maintaining the mandated quantity in circulation after the and denominations had been discontinued in August 1966. The BEP also printed but did not issue notes in the 1928 Series. An example was displayed at the 1933 Worlds Fair in Chicago.

Section 5119(b)(2) of Title 31, United States Code, was amended by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103–325) to read as follows: &quot;The Secretary shall not be required to reissue United States currency notes upon redemption.&quot; This does not change the legal tender status of United States Notes nor does it require a recall of those notes already in circulation. This provision means that United States Notes are to be canceled and destroyed but not reissued. This will eventually result in a decrease in the amount of these notes outstanding.

==Public debt of the United States==
, the U.S. Treasury calculates that million in United States Notes are in circulation and, in accordance with debt ceiling legislation, excludes this amount from the statutory debt limit of the United States. The million excludes million in United States Notes issued prior to July 1, 1929, determined pursuant to Act of June 30, 1961, 31 U.S.C. 5119, to have been destroyed or irretrievably lost.

==Politics and controversy==
The United States Notes were introduced as fiat money rather than the precious metal medium of exchange that the United States had traditionally used. Their introduction was thus contentious.

The United States Congress had enacted the &quot;Legal Tender Acts&quot; during the U.S. Civil War when southern Democrats were absent from the Congress, and thus their Jacksonian hard money views were underrepresented. After the war, the Supreme Court ruled on the &quot;Legal Tender Cases&quot; to determine the constitutionality of the use of greenbacks. The 1870 case &quot;Hepburn v. Griswold&quot; found unconstitutional the use of greenbacks when applied to debts established prior to the First &quot;Legal Tender Act&quot; as the five Democrats on the Court, Nelson, Grier, Clifford, Field, and Chase, ruled against the Civil War legislation in a 5–3 decision. Secretary Chase had become Chief Justice of the United States and a Democrat, and spearheaded the decision invalidating his own actions during the war. However, Grier retired from the Court, and President Grant appointed two new Republicans, Strong and Bradley, who joined the three sitting Republicans, Swayne, Miller, and Davis, to reverse Hepburn, 5–4, in the 1871 cases &quot;Knox v. Lee&quot; and &quot;Parker v. Davis&quot;. In 1884, the Court, controlled 8–1 by Republicans, granted the federal government very broad power to issue Legal Tender paper through the case &quot;Juilliard v. Greenman&quot;, with only the lone remaining Democrat, Field, dissenting.

The states in the far west stayed loyal to the Union, but also had hard money sympathies. During the specie suspension from 1862 to 1878, western states used the gold dollar as a unit of account whenever possible and accepted greenbacks at a discount wherever they could. The preferred forms of paper money were gold certificates and National Gold Bank Notes, the latter having been created specifically to address the desire for hard money in California.

During the 1870s and 1880s, the Greenback Party existed for the primary purpose of advocating an increased circulation of United States Notes as a way of creating inflation according to the quantity theory of money. However, as the 1870s unfolded, the market price of silver decreased with respect to gold, and inflationists found a new cause in the Free Silver movement. Opposition to the resumption of specie convertibility of the Greenbacks during 1879 was accordingly muted.

<text>The game of chess, or rather its immediate precursor, known as &quot;shatranj&quot;, was introduced to Europe from the Islamic sphere, most likely via Iberia (modern Spain), in the 9th or 10th century (possibly as early as at the beginning of the 9th century, and certainly by the mid to late 10th century).

The earliest reference to the game in Middle Latin is a poem &quot;de scachis&quot;, preserved in Einsiedeln Abbey. Chess in medieval Europe was played in monasteries and at feudal courts. An exception is Ströbeck, known as the &quot;chess village&quot;, where chess became popular among the farmers in the early 11th century already.

== Modern chess in the UK==

England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Jersey and Guernsey all have separate national chess federations, and send their own teams to international chess competitions. The English Chess Federation, which in 2005 replaced the long established British Chess Federation, is responsible for the organisation of chess in England, and also organises the annual British Chess Championship on behalf of all the UK federations. Tournament organisers and chess clubs send game results and appropriate fees to the ECF which then compiles ratings that measure the playing strength of active players.

The basis of English (ECF) ratings broadly speaking is that the difference in ratings is half the difference in percentage scores. That is, if player A beats player B in a match 8 to 2 (60% difference), you would expect his grade to be about 30 points higher. Grades are calculated by averaging out points gained or lost against opponents whose grades are known already. There are two sets of grades, one for rapidplay games (30 minutes each per game), the other for standard games (two minutes or more average per move).

In addition to games within the club, there are leagues in which clubs compete with each other and these games will also be graded. Aside from the many local leagues, the Four Nations Chess League (4NCL) is effectively a prestigious tournament run on a league format, to which many of the British and world&#x27;s elite players are attracted.

The most famous tournament held in Britain is probably the Hastings International Chess Congress, which runs from late December to early January.

Tournaments usually pay prizes both for the first three or four places and for people who get the most points within a particular range of grades, but the vast majority of players who enter them play for recreation.

<text>Plesetsk Cosmodrome () is a Russian spaceport located in Mirny, Arkhangelsk Oblast, near the town of Plesetsk, from which it takes its name. As of 2024, it is the only operational orbital spaceport in Europe and the northernmost spaceport in the world. Originally developed as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) site for the R-7 missile, its strategic location approximately north of Moscow was key to its selection.

Due to its high latitude, Plesetsk is particularly suited for specific types of satellite launches, such as those into Molniya orbits, and historically served as a secondary launch facility. Most Soviet orbital launches were conducted from Baikonur Cosmodrome, located in the Kazakh SSR. However, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Baikonur became part of Kazakhstan, which began charging Russia to lease the land for its use. As a result, Plesetsk has seen significantly increased activity since the 2000s, especially for launching military satellites. 

== Overview ==

Plesetsk () is used especially for military satellites placed into high inclination and polar orbits since the range for falling debris is clear to the north which is largely uninhabited Arctic and polar terrain. It is situated in a region of taiga, or flat terrain with boreal pine forests.

The Soyuz rocket, Cosmos-3M, Rokot, Tsyklon, and Angara are launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The heavy Proton and Zenit rockets can only be land-launched from Baikonur (Zenit may also be launched at sea).As of 26 December 2017 all Zenit launches are discontinued and all activities are suspended. 

== History ==


Plesetsk Cosmodrome was originally developed by the Soviet Union as a launch site for intercontinental ballistic missiles under the leadership and supervision of lieutenant general Galaktion Alpaidze. On 11 January 1957, the Soviet government passed the resolution about the foundation of a special military object with the secret name &quot;Angara&quot;. This secret object had to be situated in Plesetsk District, Arkhangelsk Oblast. It was named after the town of Plesetsk. The first Soviet Combat formation of intercontinental ballistic missiles R-7 of general designer Sergei Korolev had to be located in that place, in thick northern taiga to the south of Arkhangelsk. The official birthday of the proving ground was 15 July 1957. That day Colonel Gregorjev assumed his post as the missile unit commander. By 15 July 1961, four missile complexes for R-7 ICBMs were at combat status.

In January 1963, a joint decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the USSR Council of Ministers created the &quot;Research Proving Ground missile and space weapons USSR Ministry of Defense&quot; near the Ilez railway station, Velsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast. In the summer of 1963, the state leadership decided to use the Plesetsk launch facilities for launching spacecraft. In September 1963, the Council of Ministers of the USSR 3rd ALM and NIIP converted to &quot;53 minutes Research Proving Ground&quot;. Three test management, employees of combat duty, tests of rocket and space complexes, holding and processing of telemetry and trajectory measurements.

And from 1964, on the basis of rocket connection started the establishment of research proving ground missiles and space weapons. Such conversion were the favourable geographical location and a significant number of systems already deployed by the end of 1964 were on duty, four launchers R-7A, seven PU P-16U, and three PU R-9A. Since then, the landfill has developed in two directions: rocket and space.

17 March 1966 was the space birthday of Plesetsk. That day was the first missile launching of the rocket booster Vostok with space vehicle Kosmos 112. Since that time, the rocket base &quot;Angara&quot; has become Plesetsk Cosmodrome. Construction started in 1957 and it was declared operational for R-7 rockets in December 1959. The urban-type settlement of Plesetsk in Arkhangelsk Oblast had a railway station, essential for the transport of missile components. A new town for the support of the facility was named Mirny, Russian for &quot;peaceful&quot;. By 1997, more than 1,500 launches to space had been made from the site, more than from any other launch facility, although the usage has declined significantly since the break-up of the Soviet Union.

Because Plesetsk was used primarily for military launches, especially Zenit photoreconnaissance satellites, which were launched in large numbers during the 1970s-80s, the USSR did not admit to its existence, but it was discovered by British physics teacher Geoffrey Perry and his students at Kettering Grammar School, who carefully analysed the orbit of the Kosmos 112 satellite in 1966 and deduced it had not been launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Meteor 1-2 satellite launch from Plesetsk on 6 October 1969 was one of the earliest launches observed and photographed from Finland. After the end of the Cold War, it was learned that the CIA had begun to suspect the existence of an ICBM launch site at Plesetsk in the late 1950s. The Soviet Union did not officially admit the existence of Plesetsk Cosmodrome until 1983.

The use of the cosmodrome will likely increase in the future since there are concerns with security in operating the Baikonur Cosmodrome in now-independent Kazakhstan, which demands rent for its continued use. Plesetsk is not ideally suited for low inclination or geostationary launches because of its high latitude of 62° north (as compared to the Centre Spatial Guyanais at 5° north or the Kennedy Space Center at 28° 31&#x27; north). In addition, the high latitude means that lift capacity for boosters launched from Plesetsk is slightly lower than Baikonur launches. By the 2000s, Russia had completely phased out military launches from Baikonur. With some exeptions if for example the Proton M launcher is needed 

The new all-Russian Angara rocket was designed to be launched primarily from Plesetsk (and also eventually from the Vostochny Cosmodrome).

In May 2007, a new ICBM, called the RS-24 has been tested and launched there, and is seen as eventually replacing the aging RS-18/UR-100Ns (SS-19 Stiletto) and RS-20/R-36Ms (SS-18 Satan) that are the backbone of Russia&#x27;s missile forces.

In September 2011, Space Forces spokesman Colonel Alexei Zolotukhin said Russia will spend over 5 billion rubles (US$170 million) on the development and expansion of the cosmodrome in 2011. This includes the reconstruction of a local motorway and modernising the energy supply system. New facilities will be built, including a dormitory and hospital.

PL-19 Nudol anti-ballistic missile systems are located at the Cosmodrome, at the former launch site of the Tsyklon-2 rocket.

== Launch Sites ==

=== Site 16 (Inactive) ===
Site 16, also known as SK-2, is a launch complex at the Cosmodrome. It consists of a single pad, Site 16/2, and has been used by R-7 derived rockets since 1960. It has launched a total of 136 rockets across its lifespan.

Site 16 was originally built for use by R-7A Semyorka missiles, however no launches were conducted from the complex whilst it was operational. After its retirement from service in 1966, it was cannibalised for parts which were needed to repair Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome following the explosion of a Soyuz-U rocket.

Work to rebuild the complex began in 1979, and was completed in 1981. The first launch from Site 16 was conducted by a Molniya-M with an Oko satellite on 19 February 1981.

Site 16 was used for Soyuz-U and Molniya-M launches. It remained in use until 17 May 2012 when it saw its final launch, Kosmos 2480, a reconnaissance satellite on a Soyuz-U rocket. 

=== Site 32 (Inactive) ===
Site 32 at the Cosmodrome is a launch complex formerly used by Tsyklon-3 carrier rockets. It consists of a two launch pads, Site 32/1 and Site 32/2, which were used between 1977 and 2009. It has the GRAU index 11P868.

In 1970, the building of a highly automated launch complex for Tsyklon-3 booster began at Site 32, which was designed by Omsk Transmash Design Bureau led by Chief Designer Vladimir Nikolayevich Chelomey. The first launch from Site 32 was conducted from pad 2 on 24 June 1977, with the first from Site 32/1 following on 23 January 1980. The last launch from Site 32/1 occurred on 28 December 2001. Site 32/2 was retired on 30 January 2009, along with the Tsyklon-3. All 122 Tsyklon-3 launches were conducted from the site. 57 launches were recorded as having been from pad 1 and 65 were recorded from pad 2.

=== Site 35 (Active – Angara) ===

Site 35 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome is a launch complex used by Russia&#x27;s Angara rocket. The complex has a single launch pad, Site 35/1, which was first used for the maiden flight of the Angara in July 2014.

Site 35 was originally intended to support the Zenit rocket, which the Soviet Union saw as a replacement for the R-7 series. The construction of a Zenit launch complex at Plesetsk was authorised in 1976; however, development did not begin until the completion of Site 45 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, which was also constructed for Zenit. Construction at Site 35 began in the mid-1980s, but the programme was abandoned following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Following the cancellation of Zenit launches from Plesetsk, Russia had originally planned to use parts constructed for Site 35 to repair one of the Zenit pads at Baikonur that had been heavily damaged when a rocket lost thrust and fell back into the flame trench seconds after launch. Instead, the parts were eventually used on Sea Launch&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; launch platform.

When Russia began development of the Angara rocket, launch pads at both Plesetsk and Baikonur were planned. Several existing sites at Plesetsk were considered, including Site 41/1, Site 16/2, and Site 32; Site 35/1 was determined to be the most suitable. Construction began in 2004 but was not completed until April 2014.

The Angara made its maiden flight—in the one-off Angara-1.2pp configuration—from Site 35/1 on 9 July 2014, flying a successful suborbital test mission. The first orbital launch from the site was the inaugural launch of the Angara A5 on 23 December 2014, which carried a mass simulator. A second orbital test flight of the Angara A5 took place almost six years later, on 14 December 2020.

=== Site 41 (Dismantled) ===
Site 41, also known as Lesobaza and SK-1, was a launch complex at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia. It consisted of a single pad, Site 41/1, and was used by R-7 derived rockets between 1959 and 1989.

Site 41 was originally built for use by R-7A Semyorka missiles. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, an armed missile was placed on Site 41. It would have had a response time of 8–12 hours should an order have been given to launch it. No launches were conducted from Site 41 whilst it was operational.

In 1963, the complex was converted for use by carrier rockets. The first launch from the complex was a suborbital test of an R-7A Semyorka missile, on 14 December 1965. The first orbital launch from the complex occurred on 17 March 1966, when a Vostok-2 rocket launched Kosmos 112. In total, 308 orbital and two suborbital launches were conducted from the complex, using R-7A, Vostok-2, Vostok-2M, Voskhod and Soyuz-U rockets. The last launch to use the complex was of a Soyuz-U with Bion 9 on 15 September 1989. Since this launch, the pad has been disassembled.

=== Site 43 (Active – Soyuz) ===

Site 43, also known as SK-3 and SK-4, is a launch complex at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia. It consists of a two pads, Sites 43/3 and 43/4, and has been used by R-7 derived rockets since the early 1960s.

The site was originally built for use by R-7A Semyorka missiles. The first launch to use the complex was an R-7A test on 21 December 1965, from Site 43/3. The first launch from 43/4 followed on 25 July 1967.

After its retirement from service as a missile base, it was converted for use as a space launch complex. The first orbital launch was of a Voskhod rocket with Kosmos 313 on 3 December 1969.

Both pads were damaged by explosions in the 1980s. At 16:01 UTC on 18 March 1980, 48 people were killed when a Vostok-2M exploded during fueling operations at Pad 4. The disaster injured dozens more, while damaging the pad so severely that it was not used again until 1984. On 18 June 1987, a Soyuz-U rocket exploded at liftoff on Pad 3. Both were rebuilt, and are in service as of 2009.

<text>Plesetsk () is an urban locality (a work settlement) and the administrative center of Plesetsky District, Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia, situated about northeast of Moscow and south of Arkhangelsk. Municipally, it is the administrative center of Plesetskoye Urban Settlement, one of eight urban settlements in the district. Population: 

The vast Plesetsk Cosmodrome territory is located nearby and is administered from the town of Mirny which is away from Plesetsk. The territory also includes the Plestsy Airport.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the word &quot;&quot; (&quot;plyos&quot;) which means &quot;river reach&quot;. Plestsy is the name for a small lake which Plesetsk adjoins.

==History==
The area was populated by speakers of Uralic languages and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. It belonged at the trading routes connecting central and northern Russia: first, from Moscow to the White Sea along the Onega River, and then, after 1765, along the newly built road between Saint-Petersburg and Arkhangelsk, which still exists and passes Kargopol and Plesetsk. However, the Plesetsk area until the 1890s was underpopulated since it was located at some distance from the main rivers of the region. From 1796, it belonged to Arkhangelsky Uyezd of Arkhangelsk Governorate. In 1894–1897, Plesetskaya railway station was built during the construction of the railroad between Vologda and Arkhangelsk. Eventually, the volost center was moved from the &quot;selo&quot; of Navolok to Plesetskaya.

During the Russian Civil War in 1918, battles were fought between the Red Army and the British troops in and around Plesetsk.

On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, the governorates merged into Northern Krai, and Plesetsky District was established among others. It became a part of Arkhangelsk Okrug of Northern Krai. In 1930, the okrug was abolished, and the district became subordinate to the central administration of Northern Krai. In 1936, the krai itself was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast, and Plesetsk remains the center of Plesetsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast.

==Divisions==
Plesetsk is divided into:
*Tsentralny
*Stary Plesetsk
*Yuzhny Mirny
*Severny Mirny
*Kosmodrom

==Sport==
It has a youth bandy team called Yunost Pl.

==Economy==

===Transportation===
Plesetsk is located on the road connecting Kargopol with one of the principal highways in Russia, M8 between Moscow and Arkhangelsk (the highways meet in the village of Brin-Navolok). This is the historic trading route which connected Kargopol with Arkhangelsk before the railroad was built, and long stretches of this road are still unpaved. The stretch between Kargopol and Plesetsk was paved in 2011.

Plesetsk (Plesetskaya railway station) is located on the Northern Railway connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk (built in the south–north direction). From Plesetsk, a railway line to the west, connecting to Severoonezhsk, Undozero and Yangory is one of the biggest railways in Russia which does not belong to the Russian Railways. The owner of the railway is the State Department of Corrections. Plans to extend this line to Medvezhyegorsk have not been realized.

Plesetsk also serves as a transport hub to Plesetsk cosmodrome, located in the nearby town of Mirny. Plesetskaya railway station is a terminus to cosmodrome&#x27;s railway system.

==Health and utilities==
The district hospital is located in Plesetsk.

<text>In statistics and control theory, Kalman filtering (also known as linear quadratic estimation) is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, including statistical noise and other inaccuracies, to produce estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each time-step. The filter is constructed as a mean squared error minimiser, but an alternative derivation of the filter is also provided showing how the filter relates to maximum likelihood statistics. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán.

Kalman filtering has numerous technological applications. A common application is for guidance, navigation, and control of vehicles, particularly aircraft, spacecraft and ships positioned dynamically. Furthermore, Kalman filtering is much applied in time series analysis tasks such as signal processing and econometrics. Kalman filtering is also important for robotic motion planning and control, and can be used for trajectory optimization. Kalman filtering also works for modeling the central nervous system&#x27;s control of movement. Due to the time delay between issuing motor commands and receiving sensory feedback, the use of Kalman filters provides a realistic model for making estimates of the current state of a motor system and issuing updated commands.

The algorithm works via a two-phase process: a prediction phase and an update phase. In the prediction phase, the Kalman filter produces estimates of the current state variables, including their uncertainties. Once the outcome of the next measurement (necessarily corrupted with some error, including random noise) is observed, these estimates are updated using a weighted average, with more weight given to estimates with greater certainty. The algorithm is recursive. It can operate in real time, using only the present input measurements and the state calculated previously and its uncertainty matrix; no additional past information is required.

Optimality of Kalman filtering assumes that errors have a normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the words of Rudolf E. Kálmán: &quot;The following assumptions are made about random processes: Physical random phenomena may be thought of as due to primary random sources exciting dynamic systems. The primary sources are assumed to be independent gaussian random processes with zero mean; the dynamic systems will be linear.&quot; Regardless of Gaussianity, however, if the process and measurement covariances are known, then the Kalman filter is the best possible &quot;linear&quot; estimator in the minimum mean-square-error sense, although there may be better nonlinear estimators. It is a common misconception (perpetuated in the literature) that the Kalman filter cannot be rigorously applied unless all noise processes are assumed to be Gaussian.

Extensions and generalizations of the method have also been developed, such as the extended Kalman filter and the unscented Kalman filter which work on nonlinear systems. The basis is a hidden Markov model such that the state space of the latent variables is continuous and all latent and observed variables have Gaussian distributions. Kalman filtering has been used successfully in multi-sensor fusion, and distributed sensor networks to develop distributed or consensus Kalman filtering.

== History ==
The filtering method is named for Hungarian émigré Rudolf E. Kálmán, although Thorvald Nicolai Thiele and Peter Swerling developed a similar algorithm earlier. Richard S. Bucy of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory contributed to the theory, causing it to be known sometimes as Kalman–Bucy filtering. Kalman was inspired to derive the Kalman filter by applying state variables to the Wiener filtering problem.
Stanley F. Schmidt is generally credited with developing the first implementation of a Kalman filter. He realized that the filter could be divided into two distinct parts, with one part for time periods between sensor outputs and another part for incorporating measurements. It was during a visit by Kálmán to the NASA Ames Research Center that Schmidt saw the applicability of Kálmán&#x27;s ideas to the nonlinear problem of trajectory estimation for the Apollo program resulting in its incorporation in the Apollo navigation computer.

This digital filter is sometimes termed the &quot;Stratonovich–Kalman–Bucy filter&quot; because it is a special case of a more general, nonlinear filter developed by the Soviet mathematician Ruslan Stratonovich. In fact, some of the special case linear filter&#x27;s equations appeared in papers by Stratonovich that were published before the summer of 1961, when Kalman met with Stratonovich during a conference in Moscow.

This Kalman filtering was first described and developed partially in technical papers by Swerling (1958), Kalman (1960) and Kalman and Bucy (1961).

Kalman filters have been vital in the implementation of the navigation systems of U.S. Navy nuclear ballistic missile submarines, and in the guidance and navigation systems of cruise missiles such as the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Tomahawk missile and the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Air Launched Cruise Missile. They are also used in the guidance and navigation systems of reusable launch vehicles and the attitude control and navigation systems of spacecraft which dock at the International Space Station.

== Overview of the calculation ==
Kalman filtering uses a system&#x27;s dynamic model (e.g., physical laws of motion), known control inputs to that system, and multiple sequential measurements (such as from sensors) to form an estimate of the system&#x27;s varying quantities (its state) that is better than the estimate obtained by using only one measurement alone. As such, it is a common sensor fusion and data fusion algorithm.

Noisy sensor data, approximations in the equations that describe the system evolution, and external factors that are not accounted for, all limit how well it is possible to determine the system&#x27;s state. The Kalman filter deals effectively with the uncertainty due to noisy sensor data and, to some extent, with random external factors. The Kalman filter produces an estimate of the state of the system as an average of the system&#x27;s predicted state and of the new measurement using a weighted average. The purpose of the weights is that values with better (i.e., smaller) estimated uncertainty are &quot;trusted&quot; more. The weights are calculated from the covariance, a measure of the estimated uncertainty of the prediction of the system&#x27;s state. The result of the weighted average is a new state estimate that lies between the predicted and measured state, and has a better estimated uncertainty than either alone. This process is repeated at every time step, with the new estimate and its covariance informing the prediction used in the following iteration. This means that Kalman filter works recursively and requires only the last &quot;best guess&quot;, rather than the entire history, of a system&#x27;s state to calculate a new state.

The measurements&#x27; certainty-grading and current-state estimate are important considerations. It is common to discuss the filter&#x27;s response in terms of the Kalman filter&#x27;s &quot;gain&quot;. The Kalman gain is the weight given to the measurements and current-state estimate, and can be &quot;tuned&quot; to achieve a particular performance. With a high gain, the filter places more weight on the most recent measurements, and thus conforms to them more responsively. With a low gain, the filter conforms to the model predictions more closely. At the extremes, a high gain (close to one) will result in a more jumpy estimated trajectory, while a low gain (close to zero) will smooth out noise but decrease the responsiveness.

When performing the actual calculations for the filter (as discussed below), the state estimate and covariances are coded into matrices because of the multiple dimensions involved in a single set of calculations. This allows for a representation of linear relationships between different state variables (such as position, velocity, and acceleration) in any of the transition models or covariances.

== Example application ==
As an example application, consider the problem of determining the precise location of a truck. The truck can be equipped with a GPS unit that provides an estimate of the position within a few meters. The GPS estimate is likely to be noisy; readings &#x27;jump around&#x27; rapidly, though remaining within a few meters of the real position. In addition, since the truck is expected to follow the laws of physics, its position can also be estimated by integrating its velocity over time, determined by keeping track of wheel revolutions and the angle of the steering wheel. This is a technique known as dead reckoning. Typically, the dead reckoning will provide a very smooth estimate of the truck&#x27;s position, but it will drift over time as small errors accumulate.

For this example, the Kalman filter can be thought of as operating in two distinct phases: predict and update. In the prediction phase, the truck&#x27;s old position will be modified according to the physical laws of motion (the dynamic or &quot;state transition&quot; model). Not only will a new position estimate be calculated, but also a new covariance will be calculated as well. Perhaps the covariance is proportional to the speed of the truck because we are more uncertain about the accuracy of the dead reckoning position estimate at high speeds but very certain about the position estimate at low speeds. Next, in the update phase, a measurement of the truck&#x27;s position is taken from the GPS unit. Along with this measurement comes some amount of uncertainty, and its covariance relative to that of the prediction from the previous phase determines how much the new measurement will affect the updated prediction. Ideally, as the dead reckoning estimates tend to drift away from the real position, the GPS measurement should pull the position estimate back toward the real position but not disturb it to the point of becoming noisy and rapidly jumping.

== Technical description and context ==
The Kalman filter is an efficient recursive filter estimating the internal state of a linear dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements. It is used in a wide range of engineering and econometric applications from radar and computer vision to estimation of structural macroeconomic models, and is an important topic in control theory and control systems engineering. Together with the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR), the Kalman filter solves the linear–quadratic–Gaussian control problem (LQG). The Kalman filter, the linear-quadratic regulator, and the linear–quadratic–Gaussian controller are solutions to what arguably are the most fundamental problems of control theory.

In most applications, the internal state is much larger (has more degrees of freedom) than the few &quot;observable&quot; parameters which are measured. However, by combining a series of measurements, the Kalman filter can estimate the entire internal state.

For the Dempster–Shafer theory, each state equation or observation is considered a special case of a linear belief function and the Kalman filtering is a special case of combining linear belief functions on a join-tree or Markov tree. Additional methods include belief filtering which use Bayes or evidential updates to the state equations.

A wide variety of Kalman filters exists by now: Kalman&#x27;s original formulation - now termed the &quot;simple&quot; Kalman filter, the Kalman–Bucy filter, Schmidt&#x27;s &quot;extended&quot; filter, the information filter, and a variety of &quot;square-root&quot; filters that were developed by Bierman, Thornton, and many others. Perhaps the most commonly used type of very simple Kalman filter is the phase-locked loop, which is now ubiquitous in radios, especially frequency modulation (FM) radios, television sets, satellite communications receivers, outer space communications systems, and nearly any other electronic communications equipment.

== Underlying dynamic system model ==

Kalman filtering is based on linear dynamic systems discretized in the time domain. They are modeled on a Markov chain built on linear operators perturbed by errors that may include Gaussian noise. The state of the target system refers to the ground truth (yet hidden) system configuration of interest, which is represented as a vector of real numbers. At each discrete time increment, a linear operator is applied to the state to generate the new state, with some noise mixed in, and optionally some information from the controls on the system if they are known. Then, another linear operator mixed with more noise generates the measurable outputs (i.e., observation) from the true (&quot;hidden&quot;) state. The Kalman filter may be regarded as analogous to the hidden Markov model, with the difference that the hidden state variables have values in a continuous space as opposed to a discrete state space as for the hidden Markov model. There is a strong analogy between the equations of a Kalman Filter and those of the hidden Markov model. A review of this and other models is given in Roweis and Ghahramani (1999) and Hamilton (1994), Chapter 13.

In order to use the Kalman filter to estimate the internal state of a process given only a sequence of noisy observations, one must model the process in accordance with the following framework. This means specifying the matrices, for each time-step &quot;formula_1&quot;, following:
* formula_2, the state-transition model;
* formula_3, the observation model;
* formula_4, the covariance of the process noise;
* formula_5, the covariance of the observation noise;
* and sometimes formula_6, the control-input model as described below; if formula_6 is included, then there is also
* formula_8, the control vector, representing the controlling input into control-input model.

As seen below, it is common in many applications that the matrices formula_9, formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, and formula_13 are constant across time, in which case their formula_1 index may be dropped.

The Kalman filter model assumes the true state at time formula_1 is evolved from the state at formula_16 according to

:formula_17

where
* formula_2 is the state transition model which is applied to the previous state x&quot;k&quot;−1;
* formula_6 is the control-input model which is applied to the control vector formula_8;
* formula_21 is the process noise, which is assumed to be drawn from a zero mean multivariate normal distribution, formula_22, with covariance, formula_4: formula_24. 

If formula_11 is independent of time, one may, following Roweis and Ghahramani, write formula_26 instead of formula_21 to emphasize that the noise has no explicit knowledge of time.

At time formula_1 an observation (or measurement) formula_29of the true state formula_30 is made according to

:formula_31

where
* formula_3 is the observation model, which maps the true state space into the observed space and
* formula_33 is the observation noise, which is assumed to be zero mean Gaussian white noise with covariance formula_5: formula_35.

Analogously to the situation for formula_21, one may write formula_37 instead of formula_33 if formula_12 is independent of time.

The initial state, and the noise vectors at each step formula_40 are all assumed to be mutually independent.

Many real-time dynamic systems do not exactly conform to this model. In fact, unmodeled dynamics can seriously degrade the filter performance, even when it was supposed to work with unknown stochastic signals as inputs. The reason for this is that the effect of unmodeled dynamics depends on the input, and, therefore, can bring the estimation algorithm to instability (it diverges). On the other hand, independent white noise signals will not make the algorithm diverge. The problem of distinguishing between measurement noise and unmodeled dynamics is a difficult one and is treated as a problem of control theory using robust control.

== Details ==
The Kalman filter is a recursive estimator. This means that only the estimated state from the previous time step and the current measurement are needed to compute the estimate for the current state. In contrast to batch estimation techniques, no history of observations and/or estimates is required. In what follows, the notation formula_41 represents the estimate of formula_42 at time &quot;n&quot; given observations up to and including at time .

The state of the filter is represented by two variables:
* formula_43, the &quot;a posteriori&quot; state estimate mean at time &quot;k&quot; given observations up to and including at time &quot;k&quot;;
* formula_44, the &quot;a posteriori&quot; estimate covariance matrix (a measure of the estimated accuracy of the state estimate).

The algorithm structure of the Kalman filter resembles that of Alpha beta filter. The Kalman filter can be written as a single equation; however, it is most often conceptualized as two distinct phases: &quot;Predict&quot; and &quot;Update&quot;. The predict phase uses the state estimate from the previous timestep to produce an estimate of the state at the current timestep. This predicted state estimate is also known as the &quot;a priori&quot; state estimate because, although it is an estimate of the state at the current timestep, it does not include observation information from the current timestep. In the update phase, the innovation (the pre-fit residual), i.e. the difference between the current &quot;a priori&quot; prediction and the current observation information, is multiplied by the optimal Kalman gain and combined with the previous state estimate to refine the state estimate. This improved estimate based on the current observation is termed the &quot;a posteriori&quot; state estimate.

Typically, the two phases alternate, with the prediction advancing the state until the next scheduled observation, and the update incorporating the observation. However, this is not necessary; if an observation is unavailable for some reason, the update may be skipped and multiple prediction procedures performed. Likewise, if multiple independent observations are available at the same time, multiple update procedures may be performed (typically with different observation matrices H&quot;k&quot;).

=== Predict ===
=== Update ===
The formula for the updated (&quot;a posteriori&quot;) estimate covariance above is valid for the optimal Kk gain that minimizes the residual error, in which form it is most widely used in applications. Proof of the formulae is found in the &quot;derivations&quot; section, where the formula valid for any Kk is also shown.

A more intuitive way to express the updated state estimate (formula_45) is:

:formula_46

This expression reminds us of a linear interpolation, formula_47 for formula_48 between [0,1]. 
In our case:
* formula_48 is the matrix formula_50 that takes values from formula_51 (high error in the sensor) to formula_52 or a projection (low error).
* formula_53 is the internal state formula_54 estimated from the model.
* formula_55 is the internal state formula_56 estimated from the measurement, assuming formula_57 is nonsingular.
This expression also resembles the alpha beta filter update step.

=== Invariants ===
If the model is accurate, and the values for formula_58 and formula_59 accurately reflect the distribution of the initial state values, then the following invariants are preserved:
:formula_60

where formula_61 is the expected value of formula_62. That is, all estimates have a mean error of zero.

Also:
:formula_63

so covariance matrices accurately reflect the covariance of estimates.

=== Estimation of the noise covariances Q&quot;k&quot; and R&quot;k&quot; ===
Practical implementation of a Kalman Filter is often difficult due to the difficulty of getting a good estimate of the noise covariance matrices Q&quot;k&quot; and R&quot;k&quot;. Extensive research has been done to estimate these covariances from data. One practical method of doing this is the &quot;autocovariance least-squares (ALS)&quot; technique that uses the time-lagged autocovariances of routine operating data to estimate the covariances. The GNU Octave and Matlab code used to calculate the noise covariance matrices using the ALS technique is available online using the GNU General Public License. Field Kalman Filter (FKF), a Bayesian algorithm, which allows simultaneous estimation of the state, parameters and noise covariance has been proposed. The FKF algorithm has a recursive formulation, good observed convergence, and relatively low complexity, thus suggesting that the FKF algorithm may possibly be a worthwhile alternative to the Autocovariance Least-Squares methods. Another approach is the &quot;Optimized Kalman Filter&quot; (&quot;OKF&quot;), which considers the covariance matrices not as representatives of the noise, but rather, as parameters aimed to achieve the most accurate state estimation. These two views coincide under the KF assumptions, but often contradict each other in real systems. Thus, OKF&#x27;s state estimation is more robust to modeling inaccuracies.

=== Optimality and performance ===
It follows from theory that the Kalman filter provides an optimal state estimation in cases where a) the model matches the real system perfectly, b) the entering noise is &quot;white&quot; (uncorrelated), and c) the covariances of the noise are known exactly. Correlated noise can also be treated using Kalman filters. 
Several methods for the noise covariance estimation have been proposed during past decades, including ALS, mentioned in the section above. More generally, if the model assumptions do not match the real system perfectly, then optimal state estimation is not necessarily obtained by setting Q&quot;k&quot; and R&quot;k&quot; to the covariances of the noise. Instead, in that case, the parameters Q&quot;k&quot; and R&quot;k&quot; may be set to explicitly optimize the state estimation, e.g., using standard supervised learning.

After the covariances are set, it is useful to evaluate the performance of the filter; i.e., whether it is possible to improve the state estimation quality. If the Kalman filter works optimally, the innovation sequence (the output prediction error) is a white noise, therefore the whiteness property of the innovations measures filter performance. Several different methods can be used for this purpose. If the noise terms are distributed in a non-Gaussian manner, methods for assessing performance of the filter estimate, which use probability inequalities or large-sample theory, are known in the literature.

== Example application, technical ==

Consider a truck on frictionless, straight rails. Initially, the truck is stationary at position 0, but it is buffeted this way and that by random uncontrolled forces. We measure the position of the truck every Δ&quot;t&quot; seconds, but these measurements are imprecise; we want to maintain a model of the truck&#x27;s position and velocity. We show here how we derive the model from which we create our Kalman filter.

Since formula_64 are constant, their time indices are dropped.

The position and velocity of the truck are described by the linear state space
:formula_65

where formula_66 is the velocity, that is, the derivative of position with respect to time.

We assume that between the (&quot;k&quot; − 1) and &quot;k&quot; timestep, uncontrolled forces cause a constant acceleration of &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; that is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation &quot;σ&quot;&quot;a&quot;. From Newton&#x27;s laws of motion we conclude that
:formula_67

(there is no formula_68 term since there are no known control inputs. Instead, &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the effect of an unknown input and formula_69 applies that effect to the state vector) where
:formula_70

so that
:formula_71

where
:formula_72

The matrix formula_11 is not full rank (it is of rank one if formula_74). Hence, the distribution formula_75 is not absolutely continuous and has no probability density function. Another way to express this, avoiding explicit degenerate distributions is given by
:formula_76

At each time phase, a noisy measurement of the true position of the truck is made. Let us suppose the measurement noise &quot;v&quot;&quot;k&quot; is also distributed normally, with mean 0 and standard deviation &quot;σ&quot;&quot;z&quot;.
:formula_77

where
:formula_78

and
:formula_79

We know the initial starting state of the truck with perfect precision, so we initialize
:formula_80

and to tell the filter that we know the exact position and velocity, we give it a zero covariance matrix:
:formula_81

If the initial position and velocity are not known perfectly, the covariance matrix should be initialized with suitable variances on its diagonal:
:formula_82

The filter will then prefer the information from the first measurements over the information already in the model.

== Asymptotic form ==

For simplicity, assume that the control input formula_83. Then the Kalman filter may be written:

:formula_84

A similar equation holds if we include a non-zero control input. Gain matrices formula_57 evolve independently of the measurements formula_29. From above, the four equations needed for updating the Kalman gain are as follows:

:formula_87

Since the gain matrices depend only on the model, and not the measurements, they may be computed offline. Convergence of the gain matrices formula_57 to an asymptotic matrix formula_89 applies for conditions established in Walrand and Dimakis. Simulations establish the number of steps to convergence. For the moving truck example described above, with formula_90. and formula_91, simulation shows convergence in formula_92 iterations.

Using the asymptotic gain, and assuming formula_3 and formula_2 are independent of formula_1, the Kalman filter becomes a linear time-invariant filter:

:formula_96

The asymptotic gain formula_89, if it exists, can be computed by first solving the following discrete Riccati equation for the asymptotic state covariance formula_98:

:formula_99

The asymptotic gain is then computed as before.

:formula_100

Additionally, a form of the asymptotic Kalman filter more commonly used in control theory is given by

:formula_101

where

:formula_102

This leads to an estimator of the form

:formula_103

== Derivations ==

The Kalman filter can be derived as a generalized least squares method operating on previous data.

=== Deriving the &quot;posteriori&quot; estimate covariance matrix ===
Starting with our invariant on the error covariance P&quot;k&quot; | &quot;k&quot; as above
:formula_104

substitute in the definition of formula_105
:formula_106

and substitute formula_107
:formula_108

and formula_29
:formula_110

and by collecting the error vectors we get
:formula_111

Since the measurement error v&quot;k&quot; is uncorrelated with the other terms, this becomes
:formula_112

by the properties of vector covariance this becomes
:formula_113

which, using our invariant on P&quot;k&quot; | &quot;k&quot;−1 and the definition of R&quot;k&quot; becomes
:formula_114

This formula (sometimes known as the Joseph form of the covariance update equation) is valid for any value of K&quot;k&quot;. It turns out that if K&quot;k&quot; is the optimal Kalman gain, this can be simplified further as shown below.

=== Kalman gain derivation ===
The Kalman filter is a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator. The error in the &quot;a posteriori&quot; state estimation is
:formula_115

We seek to minimize the expected value of the square of the magnitude of this vector, formula_116. This is equivalent to minimizing the trace of the &quot;a posteriori&quot; estimate covariance matrix formula_117. By expanding out the terms in the equation above and collecting, we get:
:formula_118

The trace is minimized when its matrix derivative with respect to the gain matrix is zero. Using the gradient matrix rules and the symmetry of the matrices involved we find that
:formula_119

Solving this for K&quot;k&quot; yields the Kalman gain:
:formula_120

This gain, which is known as the &quot;optimal Kalman gain&quot;, is the one that yields MMSE estimates when used.

=== Simplification of the &quot;posteriori&quot; error covariance formula ===
The formula used to calculate the &quot;a posteriori&quot; error covariance can be simplified when the Kalman gain equals the optimal value derived above. Multiplying both sides of our Kalman gain formula on the right by S&quot;k&quot;K&quot;k&quot;T, it follows that
:formula_121

Referring back to our expanded formula for the &quot;a posteriori&quot; error covariance,
:formula_122

we find the last two terms cancel out, giving
:formula_123

This formula is computationally cheaper and thus nearly always used in practice, but is only correct for the optimal gain. If arithmetic precision is unusually low causing problems with numerical stability, or if a non-optimal Kalman gain is deliberately used, this simplification cannot be applied; the &quot;a posteriori&quot; error covariance formula as derived above (Joseph form) must be used.

== Sensitivity analysis ==
The Kalman filtering equations provide an estimate of the state formula_45 and its error covariance formula_44 recursively. The estimate and its quality depend on the system parameters and the noise statistics fed as inputs to the estimator. This section analyzes the effect of uncertainties in the statistical inputs to the filter. In the absence of reliable statistics or the true values of noise covariance matrices formula_126 and formula_5, the expression
:formula_128

no longer provides the actual error covariance. In other words, formula_129. In most real-time applications, the covariance matrices that are used in designing the Kalman filter are different from the actual (true) noise covariances matrices. This sensitivity analysis describes the behavior of the estimation error covariance when the noise covariances as well as the system matrices formula_2 and formula_3 that are fed as inputs to the filter are incorrect. Thus, the sensitivity analysis describes the robustness (or sensitivity) of the estimator to misspecified statistical and parametric inputs to the estimator.

This discussion is limited to the error sensitivity analysis for the case of statistical uncertainties. Here the actual noise covariances are denoted by formula_132 and formula_133 respectively, whereas the design values used in the estimator are formula_4 and formula_5 respectively. The actual error covariance is denoted by formula_136 and formula_137 as computed by the Kalman filter is referred to as the Riccati variable. When formula_138 and formula_139, this means that formula_140. While computing the actual error covariance using formula_141, substituting for formula_142 and using the fact that formula_143 and formula_144, results in the following recursive equations for formula_136 :
:formula_146

and
:formula_147

While computing formula_137, by design the filter implicitly assumes that formula_149 and formula_150. The recursive expressions for formula_136 and formula_137 are identical except for the presence of formula_153 and formula_154 in place of the design values formula_4 and formula_5 respectively. Researches have been done to analyze Kalman filter system&#x27;s robustness.

== Factored form ==
One problem with the Kalman filter is its numerical stability. If the process noise covariance Q&quot;k&quot; is small, round-off error often causes a small positive eigenvalue of the state covariance matrix P to be computed as a negative number. This renders the numerical representation of P indefinite, while its true form is positive-definite.

Positive definite matrices have the property that they have a factorization into the product of a non-singular, lower-triangular matrix S and its transpose : P = S·ST . The factor S can be computed efficiently using the Cholesky factorization algorithm. This product form of the covariance matrix P is guaranteed to be symmetric, and for all 1 &lt;= k &lt;= n, the k-th diagonal element Pkk is equal to the euclidean norm of the k-th row of S, which is necessarily positive. An equivalent form, which avoids many of the square root operations involved in the Cholesky factorization algorithm, yet preserves the desirable numerical properties, is the U-D decomposition form, P = U·D·UT, where U is a unit triangular matrix (with unit diagonal), and D is a diagonal matrix.

Between the two, the U-D factorization uses the same amount of storage, and somewhat less computation, and is the most commonly used triangular factorization. (Early literature on the relative efficiency is somewhat misleading, as it assumed that square roots were much more time-consuming than divisions, while on 21st-century computers they are only slightly more expensive.)

Efficient algorithms for the Kalman prediction and update steps in the factored form were developed by G. J. Bierman and C. L. Thornton.

The L·D·LT decomposition of the innovation covariance matrix Sk is the basis for another type of numerically efficient and robust square root filter. The algorithm starts with the LU decomposition as implemented in the Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK). These results are further factored into the L·D·LT structure with methods given by Golub and Van Loan (algorithm 4.1.2) for a symmetric nonsingular matrix. Any singular covariance matrix is pivoted so that the first diagonal partition is nonsingular and well-conditioned. The pivoting algorithm must retain any portion of the innovation covariance matrix directly corresponding to observed state-variables Hk·xk|k-1 that are associated with auxiliary observations in
yk. The l·d·lt square-root filter requires orthogonalization of the observation vector. This may be done with the inverse square-root of the covariance matrix for the auxiliary variables using Method 2 in Higham (2002, p. 263).

== Parallel form ==
The Kalman filter is efficient for sequential data processing on central processing units (CPUs), but in its original form it is inefficient on parallel architectures such as graphics processing units (GPUs). It is however possible to express the filter-update routine in terms of an associative operator using the formulation in Särkkä and García-Fernández (2021). The filter solution can then be retrieved by the use of a prefix sum algorithm which can be efficiently implemented on GPU. This reduces the computational complexity from formula_157 in the number of time steps to formula_158.

== Relationship to recursive Bayesian estimation ==
The Kalman filter can be presented as one of the simplest dynamic Bayesian networks. The Kalman filter calculates estimates of the true values of states recursively over time using incoming measurements and a mathematical process model. Similarly, recursive Bayesian estimation calculates estimates of an unknown probability density function (PDF) recursively over time using incoming measurements and a mathematical process model.

In recursive Bayesian estimation, the true state is assumed to be an unobserved Markov process, and the measurements are the observed states of a hidden Markov model (HMM).
Because of the Markov assumption, the true state is conditionally independent of all earlier states given the immediately previous state.
:formula_159

Similarly, the measurement at the &quot;k&quot;-th timestep is dependent only upon the current state and is conditionally independent of all other states given the current state.
:formula_160

Using these assumptions the probability distribution over all states of the hidden Markov model can be written simply as:
:formula_161

However, when a Kalman filter is used to estimate the state x, the probability distribution of interest is that associated with the current states conditioned on the measurements up to the current timestep. This is achieved by marginalizing out the previous states and dividing by the probability of the measurement set.

This results in the &quot;predict&quot; and &quot;update&quot; phases of the Kalman filter written probabilistically. The probability distribution associated with the predicted state is the sum (integral) of the products of the probability distribution associated with the transition from the (&quot;k&quot; − 1)-th timestep to the &quot;k&quot;-th and the probability distribution associated with the previous state, over all possible formula_162.

:formula_163

The measurement set up to time &quot;t&quot; is
:formula_164

The probability distribution of the update is proportional to the product of the measurement likelihood and the predicted state.
:formula_165

The denominator
:formula_166

is a normalization term.

The remaining probability density functions are
:formula_167

The PDF at the previous timestep is assumed inductively to be the estimated state and covariance. This is justified because, as an optimal estimator, the Kalman filter makes best use of the measurements, therefore the PDF for formula_30 given the measurements formula_169 is the Kalman filter estimate.

== Marginal likelihood ==
Related to the recursive Bayesian interpretation described above, the Kalman filter can be viewed as a generative model, i.e., a process for &quot;generating&quot; a stream of random observations z = (z0, z1, z2, ...). Specifically, the process is

# Sample a hidden state formula_170 from the Gaussian prior distribution formula_171.
# Sample an observation formula_172 from the observation model formula_173.
# For formula_174, do
## Sample the next hidden state formula_30 from the transition model formula_176
## Sample an observation formula_29 from the observation model formula_178

This process has identical structure to the hidden Markov model, except that the discrete state and observations are replaced with continuous variables sampled from Gaussian distributions.

In some applications, it is useful to compute the &quot;probability&quot; that a Kalman filter with a given set of parameters (prior distribution, transition and observation models, and control inputs) would generate a particular observed signal. This probability is known as the marginal likelihood because it integrates over (&quot;marginalizes out&quot;) the values of the hidden state variables, so it can be computed using only the observed signal. The marginal likelihood can be useful to evaluate different parameter choices, or to compare the Kalman filter against other models using Bayesian model comparison.

It is straightforward to compute the marginal likelihood as a side effect of the recursive filtering computation. By the chain rule, the likelihood can be factored as the product of the probability of each observation given previous observations,
:formula_179,

and because the Kalman filter describes a Markov process, all relevant information from previous observations is contained in the current state estimate formula_180 Thus the marginal likelihood is given by
:formula_181

i.e., a product of Gaussian densities, each corresponding to the density of one observation z&quot;k&quot; under the current filtering distribution formula_182. This can easily be computed as a simple recursive update; however, to avoid numeric underflow, in a practical implementation it is usually desirable to compute the &quot;log&quot; marginal likelihood formula_183 instead. Adopting the convention formula_184, this can be done via the recursive update rule
:formula_185
where formula_186 is the dimension of the measurement vector.

An important application where such a (log) likelihood of the observations (given the filter parameters) is used is multi-target tracking. For example, consider an object tracking scenario where a stream of observations is the input, however, it is unknown how many objects are in the scene (or, the number of objects is known but is greater than one). For such a scenario, it can be unknown apriori which observations/measurements were generated by which object. A multiple hypothesis tracker (MHT) typically will form different track association hypotheses, where each hypothesis can be considered as a Kalman filter (for the linear Gaussian case) with a specific set of parameters associated with the hypothesized object. Thus, it is important to compute the likelihood of the observations for the different hypotheses under consideration, such that the most-likely one can be found.

== Information filter ==
In cases where the dimension of the observation vector y is bigger than the dimension of the state space vector x, the information filter can avoid the inversion of a bigger matrix in the Kalman gain calculation at the price of inverting a smaller matrix in the prediction step, thus saving computing time. Additionally, the information filter allows for system information initialization according to formula_187, which would not be possible for the regular Kalman filter. In the information filter, or inverse covariance filter, the estimated covariance and estimated state are replaced by the information matrix and information vector respectively. These are defined as:
:formula_188

Similarly the predicted covariance and state have equivalent information forms, defined as:
:formula_189

and the measurement covariance and measurement vector, which are defined as:
:formula_190

The information update now becomes a trivial sum.
:formula_191

The main advantage of the information filter is that &quot;N&quot; measurements can be filtered at each time step simply by summing their information matrices and vectors.
:formula_192

To predict the information filter the information matrix and vector can be converted back to their state space equivalents, or alternatively the information space prediction can be used.
:formula_193

== Fixed-lag smoother ==
The optimal fixed-lag smoother provides the optimal estimate of formula_194 for a given fixed-lag formula_195 using the measurements from formula_196 to formula_29. It can be derived using the previous theory via an augmented state, and the main equation of the filter is the following:
:formula_198

where:
* formula_199 is estimated via a standard Kalman filter;
* formula_200 is the innovation produced considering the estimate of the standard Kalman filter;
* the various formula_201 with formula_202 are new variables; i.e., they do not appear in the standard Kalman filter;
* the gains are computed via the following scheme:
*:formula_203
:and
::formula_204
:where formula_205 and formula_206 are the prediction error covariance and the gains of the standard Kalman filter (i.e., formula_207).

If the estimation error covariance is defined so that
:formula_208

then we have that the improvement on the estimation of formula_209 is given by:
:formula_210

== Fixed-interval smoothers ==
The optimal fixed-interval smoother provides the optimal estimate of formula_211 (formula_212) using the measurements from a fixed interval formula_196 to formula_214. This is also called &quot;Kalman Smoothing&quot;. There are several smoothing algorithms in common use.

=== Rauch–Tung–Striebel ===
The Rauch–Tung–Striebel (RTS) smoother is an efficient two-pass algorithm for fixed interval smoothing.

The forward pass is the same as the regular Kalman filter algorithm. These &quot;filtered&quot; a-priori and a-posteriori state estimates formula_215, formula_105 and covariances formula_217, formula_137 are saved for use in the backward pass (for retrodiction).

In the backward pass, we compute the &quot;smoothed&quot; state estimates formula_219 and covariances formula_220. We start at the last time step and proceed backward in time using the following recursive equations:
:formula_221

where
:formula_222

formula_223 is the a-posteriori state estimate of timestep formula_1 and formula_225 is the a-priori state estimate of timestep formula_226. The same notation applies to the covariance.

=== Modified Bryson–Frazier smoother ===
An alternative to the RTS algorithm is the modified Bryson–Frazier (MBF) fixed interval smoother developed by Bierman. This also uses a backward pass that processes data saved from the Kalman filter forward pass. The equations for the backward pass involve the recursive
computation of data which are used at each observation time to compute the smoothed state and covariance.

The recursive equations are
:formula_227

where formula_228 is the residual covariance and formula_229. The smoothed state and covariance can then be found by substitution in the equations
:formula_230

or
:formula_231

An important advantage of the MBF is that it does not require finding the inverse of the covariance matrix. Bierman&#x27;s derivation is based on the RTS smoother, which assumes that the underlying distributions are Gaussian. However, a derivation of the MBF based on the concept of the fixed point smoother, which does not require the Gaussian assumption, is given by Gibbs.

The MBF can also be used to perform consistency checks on the filter residuals and the difference between the value of a filter state after an update and the smoothed value of the state, that is formula_232.

=== Minimum-variance smoother ===
The minimum-variance smoother can attain the best-possible error performance, provided that the models are linear, their parameters and the noise statistics are known precisely. This smoother is a time-varying state-space generalization of the optimal non-causal Wiener filter.

The smoother calculations are done in two passes. The forward calculations involve a one-step-ahead predictor and are given by
:formula_233

The above system is known as the inverse Wiener-Hopf factor. The backward recursion is the adjoint of the above forward system. The result of the backward pass formula_234 may be calculated by operating the forward equations on the time-reversed formula_235 and time reversing the result. In the case of output estimation, the smoothed estimate is given by
:formula_236

Taking the causal part of this minimum-variance smoother yields
:formula_237

which is identical to the minimum-variance Kalman filter. The above solutions minimize the variance of the output estimation error. Note that the Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother derivation assumes that the underlying distributions are Gaussian, whereas the minimum-variance solutions do not. Optimal smoothers for state estimation and input estimation can be constructed similarly.

A continuous-time version of the above smoother is described in.

Expectation–maximization algorithms may be employed to calculate approximate maximum likelihood estimates of unknown state-space parameters within minimum-variance filters and smoothers. Often uncertainties remain within problem assumptions. A smoother that accommodates uncertainties can be designed by adding a positive definite term to the Riccati equation.

In cases where the models are nonlinear, step-wise linearizations may be within the minimum-variance filter and smoother recursions (extended Kalman filtering).

== Frequency-weighted Kalman filters ==
Pioneering research on the perception of sounds at different frequencies was conducted by Fletcher and Munson in the 1930s. Their work led to a standard way of weighting measured sound levels within investigations of industrial noise and hearing loss. Frequency weightings have since been used within filter and controller designs to manage performance within bands of interest.

Typically, a frequency shaping function is used to weight the average power of the error spectral density in a specified frequency band. Let formula_238 denote the output estimation error exhibited by a conventional Kalman filter. Also, let formula_239 denote a causal frequency weighting transfer function. The optimum solution which minimizes the variance of formula_240 arises by simply constructing formula_241.

The design of formula_239 remains an open question. One way of proceeding is to identify a system which generates the estimation error and setting formula_239 equal to the inverse of that system. This procedure may be iterated to obtain mean-square error improvement at the cost of increased filter order. The same technique can be applied to smoothers.

== Nonlinear filters ==
The basic Kalman filter is limited to a linear assumption. More complex systems, however, can be nonlinear. The nonlinearity can be associated either with the process model or with the observation model or with both.

The most common variants of Kalman filters for non-linear systems are the Extended Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman filter. The suitability of which filter to use depends on the non-linearity indices of the process and observation model.

=== Extended Kalman filter ===
In the extended Kalman filter (EKF), the state transition and observation models need not be linear functions of the state but may instead be nonlinear functions. These functions are of differentiable type.
:formula_244

The function &quot;f&quot; can be used to compute the predicted state from the previous estimate and similarly the function &quot;h&quot; can be used to compute the predicted measurement from the predicted state. However, &quot;f&quot; and &quot;h&quot; cannot be applied to the covariance directly. Instead a matrix of partial derivatives (the Jacobian) is computed.

At each timestep the Jacobian is evaluated with current predicted states. These matrices can be used in the Kalman filter equations. This process essentially linearizes the nonlinear function around the current estimate.

=== Unscented Kalman filter ===
When the state transition and observation models—that is, the predict and update functions formula_245 and formula_246—are highly nonlinear, the extended Kalman filter can give particularly poor performance.
 This is because the covariance is propagated through linearization of the underlying nonlinear model. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF)  uses a deterministic sampling technique known as the unscented transformation (UT) to pick a minimal set of sample points (called sigma points) around the mean. The sigma points are then propagated through the nonlinear functions, from which a new mean and covariance estimate are then formed. The resulting filter depends on how the transformed statistics of the UT are calculated and which set of sigma points are used. It should be remarked that it is always possible to construct new UKFs in a consistent way. For certain systems, the resulting UKF more accurately estimates the true mean and covariance. This can be verified with Monte Carlo sampling or Taylor series expansion of the posterior statistics. In addition, this technique removes the requirement to explicitly calculate Jacobians, which for complex functions can be a difficult task in itself (i.e., requiring complicated derivatives if done analytically or being computationally costly if done numerically), if not impossible (if those functions are not differentiable).

==== Sigma points ====
For a random vector formula_247, sigma points are any set of vectors
:formula_248
attributed with

* first-order weights formula_249 that fulfill
# formula_250 
# for all formula_251: formula_252
* second-order weights formula_253 that fulfill 
# formula_254 
# for all pairs formula_255.

A simple choice of sigma points and weights for formula_256 in the UKF algorithm is
:formula_257
where formula_258 is the mean estimate of formula_256. The vector formula_260 is the &quot;j&quot;th column of formula_261 where formula_262. Typically, formula_261 is obtained via Cholesky decomposition of formula_264. With some care the filter equations can be expressed in such a way that formula_261 is evaluated directly without intermediate calculations of formula_264. This is referred to as the &quot;square-root unscented Kalman filter&quot;.

The weight of the mean value, formula_267, can be chosen arbitrarily.

Another popular parameterization (which generalizes the above) is 
:formula_268

formula_269 and formula_270 control the spread of the sigma points. formula_271 is related to the distribution of formula_272. Note that this is an overparameterization in the sense that any one of formula_269, formula_271 and formula_270 can be chosen arbitrarily.

Appropriate values depend on the problem at hand, but a typical recommendation is formula_276, formula_277, and formula_278. If the true distribution of formula_272 is Gaussian, formula_280 is optimal.

==== Predict ====
As with the EKF, the UKF prediction can be used independently from the UKF update, in combination with a linear (or indeed EKF) update, or vice versa.

Given estimates of the mean and covariance, formula_281 and formula_264, one obtains formula_283 sigma points as described in the section above. The sigma points are propagated through the transition function &quot;f&quot;.
:formula_284.

The propagated sigma points are weighed to produce the predicted mean and covariance. 
:formula_285
where formula_286 are the first-order weights of the original sigma points, and formula_287 are the second-order weights. The matrix formula_288 is the covariance of the transition noise, formula_21.

==== Update ====
Given prediction estimates formula_215 and formula_217, a new set of formula_292 sigma points formula_293 with corresponding first-order weights formula_294 and second-order weights formula_295 is calculated. These sigma points are transformed through the measurement function formula_246.
:formula_297.

Then the empirical mean and covariance of the transformed points are calculated.
:formula_298
where formula_5 is the covariance matrix of the observation noise, formula_33. Additionally, the cross covariance matrix is also needed
:formula_301

The Kalman gain is
: formula_302

The updated mean and covariance estimates are
:formula_303

=== Discriminative Kalman filter ===
When the observation model formula_304 is highly non-linear and/or non-Gaussian, it may prove advantageous to apply Bayes&#x27; rule and estimate
:formula_305
where formula_306 for nonlinear functions formula_307. This replaces the generative specification of the standard Kalman filter with a discriminative model for the latent states given observations.

Under a stationary state model
:formula_308
where formula_309, if 
:formula_310
then given a new observation formula_29, it follows that
:formula_312
where
:formula_313
Note that this approximation requires formula_314 to be positive-definite; in the case that it is not, 
:formula_315
is used instead. Such an approach proves particularly useful when the dimensionality of the observations is much greater than that of the latent states and can be used build filters that are particularly robust to nonstationarities in the observation model.

== Adaptive Kalman filter ==
Adaptive Kalman filters allow to adapt for process dynamics which are not modeled in the process model formula_316, which happens for example in the context of a maneuvering target when a constant velocity (reduced order) Kalman filter is employed for tracking.

== Kalman–Bucy filter ==
Kalman–Bucy filtering (named for Richard Snowden Bucy) is a continuous time version of Kalman filtering.

It is based on the state space model
:formula_317

where formula_318 and formula_319 represent the intensities of the two white noise terms formula_320 and formula_321, respectively.

The filter consists of two differential equations, one for the state estimate and one for the covariance:
:formula_322

where the Kalman gain is given by
:formula_323

Note that in this expression for formula_324 the covariance of the observation noise formula_319 represents at the same time the covariance of the prediction error (or &quot;innovation&quot;) formula_326; these covariances are equal only in the case of continuous time.

The distinction between the prediction and update steps of discrete-time Kalman filtering does not exist in continuous time.

The second differential equation, for the covariance, is an example of a Riccati equation. Nonlinear generalizations to Kalman–Bucy filters include continuous time extended Kalman filter.

== Hybrid Kalman filter ==
Most physical systems are represented as continuous-time models while discrete-time measurements are made frequently for state estimation via a digital processor. Therefore, the system model and measurement model are given by
:formula_327

where
:formula_328.

=== Initialize ===
:formula_329

=== Predict ===
:formula_330

The prediction equations are derived from those of continuous-time Kalman filter without update from measurements, i.e., formula_331. The predicted state and covariance are calculated respectively by solving a set of differential equations with the initial value equal to the estimate at the previous step.

For the case of linear time invariant systems, the continuous time dynamics can be exactly discretized into a discrete time system using matrix exponentials.

=== Update ===
:formula_332

The update equations are identical to those of the discrete-time Kalman filter.

== Variants for the recovery of sparse signals ==
The traditional Kalman filter has also been employed for the recovery of sparse, possibly dynamic, signals from noisy observations. Recent works utilize notions from the theory of compressed sensing/sampling, such as the restricted isometry property and related probabilistic recovery arguments, for sequentially estimating the sparse state in intrinsically low-dimensional systems.

== Relation to Gaussian processes ==
Since linear Gaussian state-space models lead to Gaussian processes, Kalman filters can be viewed as sequential solvers for Gaussian process regression.

<text>Eanflæd (19 April 626 – after 685, also known as Enfleda) was a Deiran princess, queen of Northumbria and later, the abbess of an influential Christian monastery in Whitby, England. She was the daughter of King Edwin of Northumbria and Æthelburg, who in turn was the daughter of King Æthelberht of Kent. In or shortly after 642 Eanflæd became the second wife of King Oswiu of Northumbria. After Oswiu&#x27;s death in 670, she retired to Whitby Abbey, which had been founded by Hilda of Whitby. Eanflæd became the abbess around 680 and remained there until her death. The monastery had strong association with members of the Northumbrian royal family and played an important role in the establishment of Roman Christianity in England.

==Birth, baptism, exile==

Eanflæd&#x27;s mother had grown up as a Christian, but her father was an Anglo-Saxon pagan and he remained uncommitted to the new religion when she was born on the evening before Easter in 626 at a royal residence by the River Derwent. Bede recounts that earlier on the day that Eanflæd was born, an assassin sent by Cwichelm of Wessex made an attempt on Edwin&#x27;s life. Afterward, Edwin, prompted by Æthelburg&#x27;s bishop, Paulinus, agreed to Eanflæd&#x27;s baptism and promised to become a Christian if he was granted a victory over Cwichhelm. Eanflæd was baptised, Bede says, on the feast of Pentecost (8 June 626) with eleven others of the royal household.

Edwin campaigned successfully against Cwichelm and adopted the new faith in 627. His reign ended in 633 with his defeat and death at the battle of Hatfield Chase. Fleeing the unsettled times which followed Edwin&#x27;s death, Æthelburg, together with Bishop Paulinus, returned to Kent, where Eanflæd grew up under the protection of her uncle, King Eadbald of Kent.

==Return, marriage==

In 642 Oswiu, King of Bernicia, head of the rival Northumbrian royal family, sent a priest named Utta to Kent, which then was ruled by Eanflæd&#x27;s cousin, Eorcenberht, to ask for her hand in marriage. Oswiu already had been married, to a British princess, named Rieinmellt, but recently had become king on the death of his brother, Oswald, at the battle of Maserfield. King Penda of Mercia, the victor of Maserfield, dominated central Britain and Oswiu was in need of support. Marriage with Eanflæd would provide Kentish, and perhaps Frankish, support, and any children Oswiu and Eanflæd might have would have strong claims to all of Northumbria. The date of the marriage is not recorded.

If Oswiu&#x27;s goal in marrying Eanflæd was the peaceful acceptance of his rule in Deira, the plan was unsuccessful. By 644 Oswine, Eanflæd&#x27;s paternal second cousin, was ruling in Deira. In 651 Oswine was killed by one of Oswiu&#x27;s generals. To expiate the killing of his wife&#x27;s kinsman, Oswiu founded Gilling Abbey at Gilling where prayers were said for both kings.

==Children, patron of Wilfrid, supporter of Rome==

With varying degrees of certainty, Eanflæd&#x27;s children with Oswiu are identified as Ecgfrith, Ælfwine, Osthryth, and Ælfflæd. Oswiu&#x27;s complicated series of marriages and liaisons makes identifying the mother of each of his children difficult. Kirby states that Aldfrith, Ealhfrith, and Ealhflæd were not born to Eanflæd.

Eanflæd was the early patroness of Wilfrid, who played a large part in Northumbrian politics during the reigns of Ecgfrith, Aldfrith, and Osred, and elsewhere in seventh century Britain. When Wilfrid wished to travel on pilgrimage to Rome, the Queen recommended him to her cousin, the Kentish king Eorcenberht.

==Widow, abbess, saint==

Perhaps several years after Oswiu&#x27;s death, Eanflæd retired to the monastery at Whitby. This monastery was closely associated with her royal family and many members were buried there. Divisions within the Northumbrian church led to the Synod of Whitby held at this monastery in 664, during which Oswiu had agreed to settle a calendar controversy about Easter by adopting the Roman dating method. Whitby Abbey was a double monastery, housing the nuns and monks in separate quarters although they shared the church and religious rites. Following the death of her kinswoman and the founding abbess of the monastery, Hild, in 680 Eanflæd became abbess jointly with her daughter Ælfflæd. She died in the reign of her stepson, Aldfrith (685–704). During this time, the remains of King Edwin were reburied at Whitby.

Some late sources give the feast day of Eanflæd as 24 November. Along with Edwin, Oswiu, Hilda, and later, Ælfflæd, she was buried at Whitby. William of Malmesbury believed that her remains later had been removed to Glastonbury Abbey where a monument to her was said to exist in the twelfth century.

<text>The Latin title Rex Catholicissimus, anglicised as Most Catholic King or Most Catholic Majesty, was awarded by the Pope to the Sovereigns of Spain. It was first used by Pope Alexander VI in the papal bull &quot;Inter caetera&quot; in 1493.

The best-known example of this title is the Catholic Monarchs (&quot;Los Reyes Católicos&quot;), which is used solely in reference to Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon.

Neither King Juan Carlos I nor Felipe VI have used the title, but they have not renounced it either.

<doc id="180859" wikidata="Q1219705" url="?curid=180859" title="Invisible Cities">
<text>Invisible Cities () is a postmodern novel by Italian writer Italo Calvino. It was published in Italy in 1972 by Giulio Einaudi Editore.

==Description==
The book is framed as a conversation between the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan, and Marco Polo. The majority of the book consists of brief prose poems describing 55 fictitious cities that are narrated by Polo, many of which can be read as commentary on culture, language, time, memory, death, or human experience generally.

Short dialogues between Kublai and Polo are interspersed every five to ten cities discussing the same topics. These interludes between the two characters are no less poetically constructed than the cities, and form a framing device that plays with the natural complexity of language and stories. In the middle of the book, Kublai asks about a city Polo never mentioned, his hometown of Venice. Polo replied, &quot;Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.&quot;

==Historical background==

&quot;Invisible Cities&quot; deconstructs an archetypal example of the travel literature genre, &quot;The Travels of Marco Polo,&quot; which depicts the eponymous Venetian merchant&#x27;s journey across Asia and in Yuan China (Mongol Empire). The original 13th-century travelogue shares with Calvino&#x27;s novel the brief, often fantastic accounts of the cities Polo claimed to have visited, along with descriptions of the city&#x27;s inhabitants, notable imports and exports, and stories by Polo about the region.

&quot;Invisible Cities&quot; is an example of Calvino&#x27;s use of combinatory literature, and shows influences of semiotics and structuralism. In the novel, the reader finds themselves playing a game with the author, wherein they must find the patterns hidden in the book. The book has nine chapters, but there are also hidden divisions within the book: each of the 55 cities belongs to one of eleven thematic groups (explained below). The reader can therefore play with the book&#x27;s structure, and choose to follow one group or another, rather than reading the book in chronological chapters. At a 1983 conference held at Columbia University, Calvino himself stated that there is no definite end to &quot;Invisible Cities&quot; because &quot;this book was made as a polyhedron, and it has conclusions everywhere, written along all of its edges.&quot;

==Structure==

Over the nine chapters, Marco describes a total of fifty-five cities, all women&#x27;s names. The cities are divided into eleven thematic groups of five each:
# Cities &amp; Memory
# Cities &amp; Desire
# Cities &amp; Signs
# Thin Cities
# Trading Cities
# Cities &amp; Eyes
# Cities &amp; Names
# Cities &amp; the Dead
# Cities &amp; the Sky
# Continuous Cities
# Hidden Cities

He moves back and forth between the groups, while moving down the list, in a rigorous mathematical structure. The table below lists the cities in order of appearance, along with the group they belong to:

In each of the nine chapters, there is an opening section and a closing section, narrating dialogues between the Khan and Marco. The descriptions of the cities lie between these two sections.

The matrix of eleven column themes and fifty-five subchapters (ten rows in chapters 1 and 9, five in all others) shows some interesting properties. Each column has five entries, rows only one, so there are fifty-five cities in all. The matrix of cities has a central element (Baucis). The pattern of cities is symmetric with respect to inversion about that center. Equivalently, it is symmetric against 180 degree rotations about Baucis. Inner chapters (2-8 inclusive) have diagonal cascades of five cities (e.g. Maurila through Euphemia in chapter 2). These five-city cascades are displaced by one theme column to the right as one proceeds to the next chapter. In order that the cascade sequence terminate (the book of cities is not infinite!) Calvino, in chapter 9, truncates the diagonal cascades in steps: Laudomia through Raissa is a cascade of four cities, followed by cascades of three, two, and one, necessitating ten cities in the final chapter. The same pattern is used in reverse in chapter 1 as the diagonal cascade of cities is born. This strict adherence to a mathematical pattern is characteristic of the Oulipo literary group to which Calvino belonged.

==Awards==

The book was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1975.

==Opera==
&quot;Invisible Cities&quot; (and in particular the chapters about Isidora, Armilla, and Adelma) is the basis for an opera by composer Christopher Cerrone, first produced by The Industry in October 2013 as an experimental production at Union Station in Los Angeles. In this site-specific production directed by Yuval Sharon, the performers, including eleven musicians, eight singers, and eight dancers, were located in (or moved through) different parts of the train station, while the station remained open and operating as usual. The performance could be heard by about 200 audience members, who wore wireless headphones and were allowed to move through the station at will. An audio recording of the opera was released in November 2014. The opera was named a finalist for the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Music.

<text>The Soviet calendar was a modified Gregorian calendar that was used in Soviet Russia between 1918 and 1940. Several variations were used during that time. 

The Gregorian calendar, under the name &quot;Western European calendar&quot;, was implemented in Soviet Russia in February 1918 by dropping the Julian dates of . As many as nine national holidays (paid days of rest) were implemented in the following decade, but four were eliminated or merged on , leaving only five national holidays: 22January, 1–2May, and 7–8November until 1951, when 22January reverted to a normal day.

During the summer of 1929, five-day continuous work weeks were implemented in factories, government offices, and commercial enterprises, but not collective farms. One of the five days was randomly assigned to each worker as their day of rest, without regard to the rest days assigned to their family members or friends. These five-day work weeks continued throughout the Gregorian year, interrupted only by the five national holidays. While the five-day week was used for scheduling work, the Gregorian calendar and its seven-day week were used for all other purposes.

During the summer of 1931, six-day interrupted work weeks were implemented for most workers, with a common day of rest for all workers interrupting their work weeks. Five six-day work weeks were assigned to each Gregorian month, more or less, with the five national holidays converting normal work days into days of rest. On five- and six-day work weeks were abandoned in favor of seven-day work weeks.

== History ==
=== Gregorian calendar ===
The Gregorian calendar was implemented in Russia on by dropping the Julian dates of pursuant to a Sovnarkom decree signed (Julian) by Vladimir Lenin. The decree required that the Julian date was to be written in parentheses after the Gregorian date until All surviving examples of physical calendars from show the irregular month lengths of the Gregorian calendar (such as those displayed here). Most calendars displayed all the days of a Gregorian year as a grid with seven rows or columns for the traditional seven-day week with Sunday (Воскресенье; &quot;Resurrection&quot;) first.

The 1931 pocket calendar displayed here is a rare example that excluded the five national holidays, enabling the remaining 360 days of the Gregorian year to be displayed as a grid with five rows labeled for each day of the five-day week. Even it had the full Gregorian calendar on the other side.

===Work weeks===

During the second half of May 1929, Yuri Larin (Юрий Ларин, 1882–1932) proposed a continuous production week (&quot;nepreryvnaya rabochaya nedelya&quot; = &quot;nepreryvka&quot;) to the Fifth Congress of Soviets of the Union, but so little attention was paid to his suggestion that the president of the Congress did not even mention it in his final speech. By the beginning of , Larin had won the approval of Joseph Stalin, prompting all newspapers to praise the idea. The change was advantageous to the anti-religious movement, as Sundays and religious holidays became working days. On the Supreme Economic Council of the RSFSR directed its efficiency experts to submit within two weeks a plan to introduce continuous production. Before any plan was available, during the first half of , 15% of industry had converted to continuous production according to Larin, probably an overestimate. On the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (CPC) of the Soviet Union (Sovnarkom) declared &quot;it is essential that the systematically prepared transition of undertakings and institutions to continuous production should begin during the economic year &quot;. The lengths of continuous production weeks were not yet specified, and the conversion was only to &quot;begin during the year&quot;. Nevertheless, many sources state that the effective date of five-day weeks was which was the beginning of the economic year. But many other lengths of continuous work weeks were used, all of which were gradually introduced.

=== Implementation of continuous production weeks ===
Specific lengths for continuous production weeks were first mentioned when rules for the five-day continuous work week were issued on . On building construction and seasonal trades were put on a continuous six-day week, while factories that regularly halted production every month for maintenance were put on six- or seven-day continuous production weeks. In , it was reported that about 50 different versions of the continuous work week were in use, the longest being a &#x27;week&#x27; of 37 days (30 continuous days of work followed by seven days of rest). By the end of 1929, orders were issued that the continuous week was to be extended to 43% of industrial workers by and to 67% by . Actual conversion was more rapid, 63% by . In it was decreed that the conversion of all industries was to be completed during the economic year , except for the textile industry. But on peak usage was reached, with 72.9% of industrial workers on continuous schedules. Thereafter, usage decreased. All of these official figures were somewhat inflated because some factories said they adopted the continuous week without actually doing so. The continuous week was applied to retail and government workers as well, but no usage figures were ever published.

The continuous week began as a five-day cycle, with each day color-coded and marked with a symbol. The population would be carved up into as many groups, each with its own rest day. These circles indicated when you worked and when you rested.

=== Implementation of six-day weeks ===
As early as May 1930, while usage of the continuous week was still advancing, some factories reverted to an interrupted week. On , one of the largest factories in the Soviet Union was put on an interrupted six-day week (Шестидневка = &quot;shestidnevka&quot;). On , Stalin condemned the continuous work week as then practiced, supporting the temporary use of the interrupted six-day week (one common rest day for all workers) until the problems with the continuous work week could be resolved. During , most factories were put on an interrupted six-day week as the result of an interview with the People&#x27;s Commissar for Labor, who severely restricted the use of the continuous week. The official conversion to non-continuous schedules was decreed by the Sovnarkom of the USSR somewhat later, on . Institutions serving cultural and social needs and those enterprises engaged in continuous production such as ore smelting were exempted. It is often stated that the effective date of the interrupted six-day work week was but that is only the first whole month after the &#x27;official conversion&#x27;. The massive summer 1931 conversion made this date after-the-fact and some industries continued to use continuous weeks. The last figures available indicate that on 74.2% of all industrial workers were on non-continuous schedules (almost all six-day weeks) while 25.8% were still on continuous schedules. Due to a decree dated , the traditional interrupted seven-day week with Sunday as the common day of rest was reintroduced on .

==Five-day weeks==

Each day of the five-day week was labeled by either one of five colors or a Roman numeral from I to V. Each worker was assigned a color or number to identify his or her day of rest.

Eighty percent of each factory&#x27;s workforce was at work every day (except holidays) in an attempt to increase production while 20% were resting. But if spouses, and their relatives and friends, were assigned different colors or numbers, they would not have a common rest day for their family and social life. Furthermore, machines broke down more frequently both because they were used by workers not familiar with them, and because no maintenance could be performed on machines that were never idle in factories with continuous schedules (24 hours/day every day). Five-day weeks (and later six-day weeks) &quot;made it impossible to observe Sunday as a day of rest.

The colors vary depending on the source consulted. The 1930 color calendar displayed here has days of purple, blue, yellow, red, and green, in that order beginning . Blue was supported by an anonymous writer in 1936 as the second day of the week, but he stated that red was the first day of the week. However, most sources replace blue with either or peach, all of which specify the different order yellow, pink/orange/peach, red, purple, and green. 

== Six-day weeks ==


From the summer of 1931 until Wednesday , each &quot;Gregorian month&quot; was divided into five six-day weeks, more or less (as shown by the 1933 and 1939 calendars here). The sixth day of each week, that is days 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 of the month, was a uniform day off for all workers. The last day of 31-day months was always an extra work day in factories, which combined with the first five days of the following month made six successive work days. But some commercial and government offices treated the 31st day as an extra day off. To make up for the short fifth week of February, which had just four work days in common years and five in leap years , was a uniform day off followed by only four work days in the first week of . But some enterprises treated as a regular work day, producing nine or ten successive work days between and , inclusive. The national holidays did not change, but they now converted five regular work days into holidays within three six-day weeks (none of these was on a free day, with a date divisible by 6), so May and November had just three days of work after three consecutive days off, unlike the earlier five-day week when the holidays &quot;delayed the rotation&quot; of colors and were inserted as an extra day splitting the four-day working period into two parts (or creating a longer break between two four-days of work for people whose standard day off was just before or after the holiday).

== National holidays ==
On 10 December 1918 six Bolshevik holidays were decreed during which work was prohibited.
* 1 January – New Year&#x27;s Day
* 22 January – Day of 9 January 1905
*: Commemorates Bloody Sunday on 9 January 1905 (Julian) or 22 January 1905 (Gregorian)
* 12 March – Day of the Overthrow of the Autocracy
*: Commemorates the mutiny of the Imperial Guards (about 60,000 soldiers) in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) on (Julian) or (Gregorian) during the February Revolution
* 18 March – Day of the Paris Commune
*: Commemorates the uprising of the National Guard of Paris on (Gregorian) which established the Paris Commune
* 1 May – Day of the International
*: Celebration within Russia and later the Soviet Union of International Workers&#x27; Day
* 7 November – Day of the Proletarian Revolution
*: Commemorates the Bolshevik uprising on 25 October 1917 (Julian) or 7 November 1917 (Gregorian)

In January 1925, the anniversary of Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924 was added on . Although other events were commemorated on other dates, they were not days of rest. Originally, the &quot;May holidays&quot; and &quot;November holidays&quot; were one day each ( and ), but both were extended from one to two days in 1928, making and public holidays as well.

Until 1929, regional labor union councils or local governments were authorized to set up additional public holidays, totaling to up to 10 days a year. Although people would not work on those days, they would not be &quot;paid&quot; holidays. Typically, at least some of these days were used for religious feast, typically those of the Russian Orthodox Church, but in some localities possibly those of other religions as well.

On 24 September 1929, three holidays were eliminated, , , and . Lenin&#x27;s Day on was merged with . The resulting five holidays continued to be celebrated until 1951, when ceased to be a holiday. See История праздников России (History of the festivals of Russia).
* 22 January – Day of Remembrance of 9 January 1905 and of the Memory of V.I. Lenin
*: Commemorates Bloody Sunday on 9 January 1905 (Julian) or 22 January 1905 (Gregorian) and the death of Vladimir Lenin on (Gregorian)
* 1–2 May – Days of the International
* 7–8 November – Days of the Anniversary of the October Revolution

Two &quot;Journal of Calendar Reform&quot; articles (1938 and 1943) have two misunderstandings, specifying and , not realizing that both are Julian calendar dates equivalent to the unspecified Gregorian dates and , so they specify , , , , and , plus a quadrennial leap day.

== Erroneous reporting of &quot;30-day months&quot; ==
Many sources erroneously state that both five- and six-day work weeks were collected into 30-day months.

A 1929 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article reporting Soviet five-day work weeks, which it called an &quot;Eternal calendar&quot;, associated them with the French Republican Calendar, which had months containing three ten-day weeks. In a government commission proposed a &quot;Soviet revolutionary calendar&quot; containing twelve 30-day months plus five national holidays that were not part of any month, but it was rejected because it would differ from the Gregorian calendar used by the rest of Europe. Four &quot;Journal of Calendar Reform&quot; articles (1938, 1940, 1943, 1954) thought that five-day weeks actually were collected into months, as do several modern sources.

A 1931 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article reporting six-day weeks stated that they too were collected into 30-day months, with the five national holidays between those months. Two of the &quot;Journal of Calendar Reform&quot; articles (1938 and 1943) thought that six-day as well as five-day weeks were collected into 30-day months. A couple of modern sources state that five-day weeks plus the first two years of six-day weeks were collected into 30-day months.

Apparently to place the five national holidays between 30-day months since , Parise (1982) shifted Lenin&#x27;s Day to , left two Days of the Proletariat on , and shifted two Days of the Revolution to and , plus (all Gregorian dates). Stating that all months had 30 days between and , the &quot;Oxford Companion to the Year&quot; (1999) &#x27;corrected&#x27; Parise&#x27;s list by specifying that &quot;Lenin Day&quot; was after ( Gregorian), a two-day &quot;Workers&#x27; First of May&quot; was after ( Gregorian), two &quot;Industry Days&quot; were after ( Gregorian), and placed the leap day after ( Gregorian).

Throughout this period, &quot;Pravda&quot;, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, and other newspapers continued to use Gregorian calendar dates in their mastheads alongside the traditional seven-day week. Pravda dated individual issues with , , , , , , and , but never used during the period . The traditional names of &quot;Resurrection&quot; () for Sunday and &quot;Sabbath&quot; () for Saturday continued to be used, despite the government&#x27;s officially anti-religious atheistic policy. In rural areas, the traditional seven-day week continued to be used despite official disfavor. Several sources from the 1930s state that the old Gregorian calendar was not changed. Two modern sources explicitly state that the structure of the Gregorian calendar was not touched.
