<text>Minden () is a middle-sized town in the very north-east of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, the largest town in population between Bielefeld and Hanover. It is the capital of the district () of Minden-Lübbecke, situated in the cultural region of Ostwestfalen-Lippe (OWL) and the administrative region of Detmold. The town extends along both sides of the River Weser, and is crossed by the Mittelland Canal, which is led over the river on the Minden Aqueduct.

In its 1,200-year written history, Minden had functions as diocesan town from to the Peace of Westphalia in , as capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Minden as imperial territory since the 12th century, afterwards as capital of Prussia&#x27;s Minden-Ravensberg until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, and as capital of the East-Westphalian region from the Congress of Vienna until 1947. Furthermore, Minden has been of great military importance with fortifications from the 15th to the late 19th century, and is still a garrison town.

Minden hosts diverse industries, none predominant. The town has been terminus of one of the oldest German railway trunks since 1847, adding to the multimodal transport hub between its harbour, federal roads, and a nearby highway (Autobahn) junction.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

Minden is a town in the northeastern part of the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The town is crossed by the Weser flowing north. The town centre lies on a plateau on the western side of the river north of the Porta Westfalica gap between the ridges of the Weser Hills and Wiehen Hills, where the Weser leaves the Weser Uplands and flows into the North German Plain. The small Bastau stream flows into the Weser from the west near the town centre. The edge of the plateau marks the transition from the Middle Weser Valley to the Lübbecke Loessland, divides the upper town from the lower town, and marks the boundary between two ecological zones.

In the frame of Natural regions of Germany, the western part of Minden belongs to a sequence of geomorphological units (from south to north): the Wiehen Hills, the Lübbecke Loessland, therein the Bastau depression, and the Dümmer Geest Lowland. The eastern part lies in the Middle Weser Valley depression.

Crossing the Weser valley was once favoured by a ford with a break in the middle; there its meander touches the western edge of the valley, the eastern floodplain is usually flood-meadow, so that the central bridgehead () becomes a river island. Today a system of two bridges crosses the valley.

The Mittelland Canal connecting the river systems of Ems, Weser and Elbe traverses the town from west to east. These waterways cross in the northern area of the town at the Minden Aqueduct ().

The Weser leaves the Minden area at its lowest part in the quarter of Leteln, at , while the highest part is the top of &quot;Häverstädter Berg&quot; with , at the edge of the Wiehen Hills in the quarter of Haddenhausen. The altitude of the town is given officially as , based on the elevation of the town hall.

The town covers an area of . It extends from north to south and from east to west.

Minden is northeast of Bielefeld, west of Hanover, south of Bremen and east of Osnabrück.

=== Neighbouring settlements ===
The neighbouring towns and communities of Minden are (clockwise from north): Petershagen, Bückeburg (Schaumburg District in Lower Saxony), Porta Westfalica, Bad Oeynhausen, and Hille.

=== Town subdivision ===
Minden is administratively divided into 19 quarters:

* Bärenkämpen
* Bölhorst
* Dankersen
* Dützen
* Haddenhausen
* Häverstädt
* Hahlen
* Innenstadt (town centre)
* Königstor
* Kutenhausen
* Leteln-Aminghausen
* Meißen
* Minderheide
* Nordstadt
* Päpinghausen
* Rechtes Weserufer
* Rodenbeck
* Stemmer
* Todtenhausen
The area of the historical town until the 19th century is today part of the quarter Innenstadt.

=== Climate ===
Minden has no meteorological station, therefore the data of the next station Bückeburg in distance of are given.

The meteorological data of the whole East-Westphalian region comply with zone &quot;Cfb&quot; of the Köppen climate classification, named as Temperate Oceanic climate. This rough classification gives no suitable and detailed description of the regional situation. The furthest north-eastern part of East-Westphalia is the driest of the state, though located in a small distance to the sea, caused by the main direction of the cyclones from roughly west to east with its prevailing south-westerly rain-bringing weather fronts. So the Minden region lies in the leeward rain shadow of the Teutoburg Forest and the Wiehen Hills. A cloudy weather south of the Wiehen Hills is often connected with clear sky in the north of the hills.

== Geology, mineral deposits and their use ==

The Wiehen Hills escarpment extends more than from west of Osnabrück to the Porta Westfalica gap and is continued in the Weser Hills range. The escarpment forming horizons incline gently flattening to the north; they are of jurassic age, overlayed by cretaceous sediments that form the hill of Bölhorst, and tertiary layers further to the north. The underground basis is of palaeozoic material from Devonian to Permian. A new described genus of dinosaur, the Wiehenvenator, was found in the Wiehen Hills near Haddenhausen, popularly referred to as the &quot;Monster of Minden&quot;.

The Porta sandstone () of the Wiehen Hills has been used as building material for centuries and is seen in many public and private buildings in Minden and the region. Another valuable material is iron ore, that was being mined until the first half of the 20th century. Mining relics remain: e.g. the &quot;Potts Park&quot;, an amusement park in Dützen, on a former ore mine.

The Bölhorst hill north of the Wiehen Hills is formed by horizons of Lower Cretaceous age and, in geological sense, is the western extension of the eastward Bückeberg in the Schaumburg district. In both elevations the hard coal containing Berriasian layers reach near to the surface. By reason of the correspondence of the Bückeberg Formation to the Wealden Group, the type of coal found here was named in German. Mining in the Minden Coalfield started in the 17th century during the Swedish occupation and ended in the late 19th century. Another coal mine in the eastern quarter of Meißen worked from 1878 to 1958.

A source of 10-percentage brine with its origin in the deep Zechstein series was pumped in the Bölhorst mine and once used for balneotherapy.

The last relief-forming age was the pleistocene. During the Saalian glaciation the whole region was ice-covered, now verified by glacial erratic rocks from Scandinavia placed for decoration in the town. The Bastau depression, a late-Saalian Weser bed, became a marshy peat-covered area; the peat is completely exhausted for its use in firing. In the time of Weichselian glaciation the glacier did not reach this region. In the periglacial climate of that time fine material (silt) was blown and accumulated north of the Wiehen Hills as well as north of the Bastau depression in either small west–east stripes of loess.

In the Weser depression, Weichselian gravel deposits are found and used in gravel pits.

== Land use ==

The forestry use of the considerably inclined Wiehen Hills shows a striking contrast to the nearly woodless loess stripes of the northern foothills as well as north of the Bastau depression. The loess developed to most fertile soils (luvisols) and has been used as arable land since prehistoric times. Both of its stripes are key traffic veins, today the from Minden to Lübbecke and the regional road from Minden to Espelkamp. The villages, so connected, have developed into settlements of considerable size.

The Bastau depression is wood and housing estate-free, having agricultural use. Only one north-south road passes through it, southwest of the town. The gleysols of this area as well as in the Weser valley depression are in agricultural use after drainage.

Four nature conservation areas extend completely or partly over Minden territory. The most northern of them provides a biological site () for education in ecology.

The percentage of woodland is smaller than in other towns of the same type.

== History ==
=== Ancient history ===

The Minden area shows continuing settlement activity from the 1st to the 4th century, when it belonged to the Weser–Rhine Germanic development sphere. During the Roman campaigns in Germania, this part of Westphalia came into the focus of military activities. It remains a matter of discussion whether or not the Minden region was the location of the military camp from where commander Publius Quinctilius Varus began marching to the, for Rome disastrous, Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in . Likewise, the localization of the Battle of Idistaviso and the Battle of the Angrivarian Wall, both taking place in , to the eastern part of Minden or its neighbour town of Porta Westfalica is uncertain. Definite archaeological proofs for these locations have not been found . However, relicts of a temporary Roman military camp were found in Barkhausen in 2008, about south of the centre of Minden.

=== Middle Ages ===
The name &quot;Minda&quot; was firstly mentioned in a Royal Frankish Annals record referring to an army assembly held by Charlemagne in . The location of the so-named settlement is supposed at the left river side, where today&#x27;s &quot;Fischerstadt&quot; exists. Directly neighbouring was the suspected site of a permanent frankish army camp and a royal estate, located favourably at the place where ways from the south were bundled by the Porta Westfalica gap, connected with a west–east way parallel to the Wiehen and Weser hills, and at a ford through the Weser. The region had already been converted to Christianity, when around a bishopric was founded in Minden, one of the seven diocese foundations established under the rule of Charlemagne. The first cathedral was built nearby to the older village. After the dissolution of the Duchy of Saxony in 1180 the bishop became sovereign of the Prince-Bishopric of Minden as a constitutional territory of the Holy Roman Empire, and remained in this status until 1648. During the Investiture controversy two bishops were nominated at the same time in 1080 both by the papal supporters and those of King Henry IV.

The Cathedral close on the lower Weser terrace was soon surrounded to the north and west by a settlement of artisans and merchants, who lived in a parish of their own. The development of the upper town began with the activities of ecclesiastical convents. A convent of Benedictine nuns removed from the Wiehen Hills to the northwestern edge of the town around St Mary approximately . In 1029, the Canonical Convent of St Martin appears, and a 1042-founded Benedictine monastery removed in 1434 from the Weser shore to a new upper site, where the monastery of St Mauritius was founded. The Dominicane convent St Paul was established in 1236.

German medieval sovereigns governed their realms with an itinerant court, travelling from town to town. Louis the German hold an imperial assembly in Minden in 852. The Emperors of the Ottonian and Salian dynasty visited Minden several times. When Henry IV came to visit in 1062, a dispute between members of his entourage and citizens caused a fire that destroyed the cathedral and parts of the town. The imperial visit of Charles IV in October 1377 was the last one until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.

In 1168, Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, married his second wife Matilda, daughter of Henry II of England, in Minden Cathedral; with this marriage Henry maintained the continuance of the House of Welf.

The rights to hold a market, to mint coins, and to collect customs duties were granted in 977 by Emperor Otto II. Until the beginning of the 13th century, the bishop appointed the as secular administrator of the town. The citizens of Minden and their council obtained independence from the bishop&#x27;s rule around 1230 and received a town charter in 1301. The increased self-confidence of the citizens was demonstrated by the construction of the town hall, probably adjoining the separately governed cathedral precinct. As a result, the Bishop moved his official residence from Minden to Petershagen in 1307.

The economic development of Minden was influenced by its location on a navigable river and by its success in grain trading since the Middle Ages. Minden got the right to store goods and could force passing ships to unload their cargo; furthermore the town became a flourishing member of the Hanseatic League. The precise year of the first Weser bridge construction is not known. A previous wooden pedestrian bridge was replaced in the late 13th century by another one fit for wagon transport. In the early 16th century Minden got a stone arch bridge.

=== Modern era since the Reformation ===
At the end of the medieval age the papal legate Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa visited some German church provinces to remedy deficits in pastoral care and clerical administration. During his journey he stayed in Minden for one week in August 1451, where he signed various decrees, but on the whole this project did not achieve the intended aims. The Lutheran Reformation was introduced in 1529 during a vacancy after the death of the not very respected Bishop Francis of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and a 36-man unit constituted itself as town regiment. A new church order, based on Martin Luther&#x27;s principles, was announced from the pulpit of St Martin&#x27;s Church () on 13 February 1530. The Dominican convent was dissolved in 1529, and its buildings have been used since 1530 as a location of the new founded municipal Gymnasium, the first Protestant in Westphalia.
Imperial Catholic troops occupied Minden from 1625 to 1634 during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Protestant Swedish troops laid siege to Minden and captured it in 1634. Queen Christina of Sweden () granted Minden full sovereignty in internal and external affairs. During the Catholic occupation the bishop ordered the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1630; the calendar was re-set in 1634 under the Swedish régime, but finally standardized to the new style in 1668. 
The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 secularized the Prince-Bishopric to the Principality of Minden and assigned the territory to the Prince Electorate of Brandenburg, later named Brandenburg-Prussia. Swedish troops moved back in 1650, and the principality administration was restored from Petershagen to Minden in 1668. The Brandenburgian &quot;Great Elector&quot; Frederick William () confirmed all traditional rights of the town, but under his successors King Frederick I () and Frederick William I () the town was subordinated to the strongly centralized Prussian government in the spirit of absolutism. The 400-year civil self-determination ended with two town regulations from 1711 and 1721; the representatives of the town were no longer elected for a certain period, but for life, and they needed royal confirmation for inauguration.

The Battle of Minden took place some miles to the north of Minden on 1 August 1759, during the Seven Years&#x27; War of 1756 to 1763. The allied forces of Prussia, Great Britain, and some German allies defeated the allied French and Saxonian troops in a decisive battle. The region remained Prussian, with the adjacent region in the possession of the British King George II (being the Prince-elector of Hanover in personal union). Because French troops had occupied the town twice during the war, King Frederick the Great realized that it could no more be defended in the old manner; thus he gave order to annul Minden&#x27;s status as a fortress in 1764.

The town functioned as the capital of the Prussian territory of Minden-Ravensberg from 1719 to 1807 and as the seat of the upper administrative authority named (Chamber of War Affairs and State Property), that ruled Minden-Ravensberg together with the Prussian territories of the County of Lingen and the County of Tecklenburg. The most prominent president of the chamber was the Baron vom Stein (in office from 1796 to 1803).

The Weser had long been an important trade route, and the legal regulation of trading had immense significance. In 1552 Emperor Charles V conferred the privilege of its merchants&#x27; unhindered trading on the whole Weser to the town of Minden. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Emperor Ferdinand II confirmed the staple right to Minden in 1627, meaning that all passing merchants had to offer their goods for sale for some days. As other towns on the Weserlike Bremen and Mündenhad similar rights, many conflicts arose about the partly contradictory legal positions.

=== From the Napoleonic Wars to World War I ===

In course of the War of the Fourth Coalition, French troops occupied the town on 13 November 1806. In the following year Napoleon founded the Kingdom of Westphalia, governed by his brother Jerome Bonaparte as king, and Minden became part of this client state until 1810 as district capital in the Weser department. On 1 January 1811 Napoleon moved Minden to the department Ems-Supérieur of the French Empire; now the Weser formed the eastern frontier between France and Westphalia. The rights of the Cathedral chapter in the cathedral close were abolished, the still existing convents were dissolved, and some ecclesiastical buildings like St John&#x27;s church were secularized and used for military purposes. Before the French troops abandoned Minden on 3 November 1813 after the disastrous Battle of Leipzig, they blew up some of the arches of the Weser bridge, with the damage replaced for decades by a wooden auxiliary construction only.

Minden became part of the Kingdom of Prussia again as capital both of the District of Minden and the government region () in the new formed Province of Westphalia. By royal order it was declared a fortress once more. The fortress regulations ordered a area in front of the wall being free of any buildings, not even vertical gravestones were allowed. The refortification had severe consequences, hindering any extension of the town area and thus economic development. The was stationed in the garrison from 1820 to 1919, when it was dissolved; the naming Colonel-in-chief was Prince Frederick of the Netherlands and after his death Queen Emma of the Netherlands. Frederick&#x27;s wife Princess Louise of Prussia was Colonel-in-chief of the , that was partly stationed in Minden, too. Since 1999, the encamped a new barracks area in the nordwest of the town centre. The &quot;Hanoveran Pionier-Battalion No. 10&quot; was part of the X Corps, that was incorporated into the Prussian Army after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, and had its barracks near to Minden station. The main military training area was a large location in today&#x27;s quarter of Minderheide at the very northwest edge of the town, an area that had already been part of the main fighting during the Battle of Minden in 1759.

After the Congress of Vienna of 1815 had passed general principles of free traffic on the main rivers, the six Weser-states of the German Confederation annulated all restrictions and most of the financial burdens for shipping on the river by the Weser Shipping Act () of 1823.
The first steam ship was put in operation in 1836, and a first harbour basin was built in 1859 on the east side of the river, connected with the railway in 1863. In the following decades, the great majority of transferred goods were imported goods, as export was of low importance. Inland shipment grew enormously after the completion of the &quot;Mittelland Canal&quot; and its connection to the Weser by the shaft lock in 1915.

The trunk line of the Cologne-Minden Railway Company was opened in 1847 with a solidly fortified station and connected with the Hanover–Minden railway. After defortification, the railway got an important momentum for economic growth in Minden.

The spatial narrowness in the fortress restricted the development of industrial firms of different branches to a certain degree, but did not prevent it. 
The dominant industry, as well as in the whole district, was the manufacture of cigars; this branch decreased after World War I and finally vanished, because the growing market share of cigarettes had been ignored. Minden was seat of a Chamber of commerce from 1849 to 1932, when it was merged with those of Bielefeld.

Overpopulation and unemployment were the reasons for an enormous emigration from the Minden Land; various emigration agencies had their location in Minden.

The town remained a Prussian fortress until 1873, when Germany&#x27;s Imperial Diet () passed the law to remove the fortress status of several fortified places, among them Minden. The fortress walls were razed by 1880the town had to pay for itand a new Weser bridge was constructed, permitting the town to catch up economically. However, it was never able to regain its former political and economic importance.

The upper class used the new conditions for construction of a new town quarter in a half-circle to the north and west of the old centre with prestigious buildings on spacious plots, but the urgent narrowness inside the centre maintained. A lot of buildings in the style of historicism replaced older ones at the market place and in the main streets.
The lack of buildings outside the fortifications was favourable for planning a road network in the outer areas of the town. Since the 1890s, a sequence of six ring roads in the west and north of the town has formed the backbone of the road network.

Grandiose festivities took place when Emperor William II and Empress Auguste Victoria visited Minden and the southern village of Barkhausen for inauguration of the Emperor William Monument on the Wittekindsberg above the Porta Westfalica gap on 18 October 1896. Since then the monument has been a visible element of the southern view from Minden. The first line of the Minden tramway has connected the primary site of the memorial with Minden since 1893 when the memorial was still under construction.

The Minden District Railways (), founded in 1898, built up a narrow-gauge railway net with three lines until World War I. Minden got a municipal water supply system in the 1880s and an electric power station in 1902.

=== The Weimar Republic and the Nazi Regime ===
The republican November Revolution of 1918 passed with only small disturbances that occurred in a few barracks of the Minden garrison on 7 and 8 November 1918. A workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; council, most of them members or supporters of the Social Democratic Party, took control in the afternoon of 18 November, but co-operated both with the town council and the military and civil administration as well and was successful in calming the situation.

The situation became more critical during the Kapp Putsch of March 1920, when right-wing officers tried to overthrow the legitimate government of the &quot;German Reich&quot;. A majority of the town council declared their loyalty to President Friedrich Ebert and Chancellor Gustav Bauer, who for their part confirmed the authority of the Minden Workers&#x27; Council. The assassination of Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau on 24 June 1922 resulted in serious rioting in Minden. A demonstration of 15,000 people in support of the government was held at the market square on 27 June. Public opinion changed during the time of the Great Depression, and in the 1930-election of the town council, the NSDAP received 6 of 31 seats, and in the 1933-election, the last democratic one, they won a majority comprising 16 of 28 seats. The NSDAP increased their Minden results of the Reichstag elections from 2.0 percent in May 1928 to 40.1 percent in July 1932.

Although the German armed forces were restricted considerably by the regulations of the Treaty of Versailles, Minden remained a garrison town of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; with the Pioneer Battalion No. 6 and the Artillery Regiment No. 6, both parts of the 6th Division. However, soldiers became more and more connected with right-wing groups, although officially obliged to political neutrality. The military units put forward the construction of sporting facilities: a stadium (, now ), a public open-air pool (now ), and a horse racecourse. Both Walther von Brauchitsch (who organized annual horse tournaments from 1925 to 1927) and Wilhelm Keitel (who succeeded him in the same function until 1929) spent part of their career in Minden.

When the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; was transformed to the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in 1935, army units were enlarged. Minden received another pioneer battalion (No. 46), new barracks (, after WWII &quot;Clifton barracks&quot;) and an exercise area at the Weser shore were built. After the last prisoners of war had left the camp area Minderheide in 1922, the place was used again for military exercise, horse and motorcycle sport, and a part from it as a place to land for small planes, as had already been happened starting in 1910. Two hangars and workshops for repairing and overhauling were built in this area beginning in 1936, where new types of planes were also tested.

After the war, the Minden District railway opened a fourth line to the coal mine of Meißen and the ore mine of Kleinenbremen, and in 1924 began to convert the narrow gauge to standard gauge tracks. The Minden tram was electrified in 1920, and three lines were added by 1930.

In 1929, the Melitta firm transferred its production from Dresden to Minden. From 1935 the produced chemicals for pharmaceutical use, e.g. codeine; because of potentially military interest the producing company &quot;Knoll AG&quot; in Ludwigshafen had decided for a more inner-German producing location.

From 1934 to 1940, two suburbs with single-family houses of modest size ( and ) were created in considerable distance to the previous settlements. Like in other communities, the names of some streets or places were changed for political reasons during the Third Reich, with most being reverted in 1945.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, underground factories were built in the Weser Hills and Wiehen Hills near Minden. Slave labourers from a nearby subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp were forced to produce weapons and other war materiel. After the war the machinery was removed by American troops and the entrances were sealed.
Most of the Jewish citizens of Minden were deported, dispossessed and murdered. &quot;Stolpersteine&quot; (literally &#x27;stumbling stones&#x27;, metaphorically &#x27;stumbling blocks&#x27;) have begun to be laid within Minden&#x27;s pavements as a memorial to them.
Minden sustained severe damage from Allied bombings during World War II. These attacks were minor during the early phase of the war. The raid on 26 October 1944 on the canal aqueduct damaged the wall of the Mittelland Canal, and numerous workers in a nearby air raid shelter were drowned. The last and most devastating air raid was conducted by Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft of the United States Army Air Forces on 28 March 1945 and destroyed great parts of the town centre, including the town hall and cathedral, and resulted in the death of over 180 people. At the end of the war 13% of all buildings were destroyed or damaged.

When the Allied troops were approaching, the Nazi officials were ordered to leave the town to the east or the north; even the police and the firebrigade drew back, but Mayor Werner Holle remained. The 1st Canadian Airborne Battalion of the 3rd Parachute Brigade came from Bad Oeynhausen in the south, not through the Porta Westfalica gap but over the Wiehen Hills at the pass of Bergkirchen. On the evening of 4 April 1945 they took the town centre nearly without resistance. Almost all the bridges over the Weser and Mittelland Canal as well as the canal aqueduct had just been blown up by the German Army in a futile attempt to delay the Allied advance, according to Hitler&#x27;s Nero Decree. Before the retreat the army set fire to the Granary and the Army bakery; the spreading out of fire to the St Martin&#x27;s church could be avoided only with great difficulties for lack of the fire brigade. In the first days of occupation a lot of plunder took place in the now police-less town.

=== Postwar time ===

In the early post-war time the Minden region became an important part of the British Occupation Zone. The British Military Government took its main location in Bad Oeynhausen before it moved to Berlin. The headquarter of the British Forces remained there until 1954. All the German Wehrmacht barracks in Minden were taken over by the British Army, as well as the former exercise area on Minderheide, where the St George&#x27;s barracks were built in the following years, and on a nearby location the Kingsley barracks. 466 houses were confiscated in 1945. As immediate measure, the British Army set up an auxiliary bridge (the &quot;Francis bridge&quot;), that was in use until the regular bridge was restored in 1947.

The Economic Council for the British Occupation Zone () was founded in Minden on 11 March 1946 for reactivation of the German economy and supervised the work of the Central Office for Economy () at the same place. The under its head &quot;Viktor Agartz&quot; fought against the policy of industrial dismantling and tried to reorganize the economy with perspectives of planned economy. After the partial conjunction of the American and British Occupation Zones in 1947 to the Bizone, the Bizonal Economic Council continued the activities of the Minden in Frankfurt in the American occupation zone, where with Ludwig Erhard the course was changed to a market economy.

The town administration resumed its work on 9 April 1945 on a provisional basis. Subsequent to the foundation of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946, the Free State of Lippe was adjoined to it in 1947. Consequently Minden lost its position as a regional capital to the former Lippian capital Detmold in 1947. In contrast to the other Allied Powers, the British changed the German community regulation for their occupation zone in the way of strict separation of powers. Beginning in 1946, the mayor was merely an honorary position as head of town and chairman of the town council, with a professional town director () being chief of administration. In North Rhine-Westphalia these regulations were in force until 1998.

Parts of the Federal Railways Central Offices were moved to Minden in 1950. In the course of West German rearmament, the (Duke of Brunswick Barracks) was built for the new garrison of the Federal Forces (&quot;Bundeswehr&quot;) in 1959 in the western quarter of Rodenbeck and another barracks in the quarter of Minderheide.

The town centre reconstruction adapted largely to the pre-war situation, the previous road system remained, and the destroyed houses were rebuilt in a 1950s style. Even in the undestroyed areas, dilapidated buildings were replaced by new ones that deviated from the quarter&#x27;s character by form and volume. The renewal of the main shopping street &quot;Scharn&quot; was planned by Werner March.

The serious lack of housing in the 1950s and 1960s, caused by bombing and the post-war migration of refugees, was addressed with new housing areas, especially in the west and north of the centre. Furthermore, some housing estates for British soldiers&#x27; families were developed.

The Minden tramway reduced the lines and finally stopped running in 1959; a trolley bus line on the right side of the Weser ran from 1953 to 1965.

=== From the local government reorganization to present day ===
On 1 January 1973, the previously separate surrounding communities of Aminghausen, Bölhorst, Dankersen, Dützen, Haddenhausen, Hahlen, Häverstädt, Kutenhausen, Leteln, Meißen, Päpinghausen, Stemmer, Todtenhausen as well as parts of Barkhausen, Hartum and Holzhausen II were incorporated into the town of Minden. Thereby the area of Minden increased from to and the population number from about 54,000 to 84,000. At the same time the former districts of Minden and Lübbecke were merged to the new district () of Minden-Lübbecke, of which Minden became the capital. A new district administration building was constructed south of the town centre on the site of an old barracks; the former administrative building has since then used as a community archive.

In the 1960s, ongoing problems with the town centre became increasingly urgent, such as high population density, large percentage of low-income persons, houses in poor condition, outdated business premises, unsuitable for pedestrians, and severe shortage of parking lots. Therefore, an urban renewal was carried out in the 1970s, within the frame of the federal law for urban development promotion (&quot;Städtebauförderungsgesetz&quot;, 1971), and subsidized by public money. Dilapidated buildings were renovated or replaced by new structures, although the removal of timber-framed houses was later regretted. The height of buildings was restricted to four or five storeys. The main shopping areas were rearranged to a pedestrian zone. Public traffic was kept away from the inner part with a new central bus station nearby. Since then private traffic has been inhibited from passing through the centre, but houses can still be reached by a dead end system. Two large parking areas at the edge of the town centre, an underground car park and several multistorey car parks provide parking facilities. To keep away the regional traffic, two new Weser bridges and a new bypass road in the very east were built; the old bridge was replaced in 1978.

The administration of the enlarged town required a new building. Architect Harald Deilmann planned this complex directly from the old town hall to the cathedral court in the style of structuralism. Since its completion in 1977 it has been a matter of public discussion, not only for the look of the façade, but also for blocking the scenic view of the cathedral from the arches of the old town hall. In 2006 a controversial resolution by the town council proposed the demolition of the town hall extensions to make room for a new shopping mall. However, a 57% majority opposed this plan in a referendum. Today the whole town hall building complex is classified as historical monument, and extensive renovation has been in progress since 2019.

The shoreline of the Weser was improved in 1976 by extending the promenade to the (Fishermen&#x27;s Town). The &quot;Glacis&quot;, a park-like open space in front of the old fortifications, which was important as a green belt, was altered and made more accessible. The old town wall fronting the Fischerstadt was restored to its former height. 
The opposite shore area () has been made accessible by a footbridge. This improves access to a large parking area and festival site.

When British troops had left Minden in 1994, their barracks areas became valuable sites for further town development (&quot;conversion areas&quot;).

=== Place of prosecution and imprisonment ===
Minden was the location of criminal prosecution or imprisonment in a number of very different cases.

* After the reformation, Minden was a stronghold of witch-hunts in Germany. There were 128 prosecutions for witchcraft between 1603 and 1684. As in nearby regions, almost all those sentenced persons were women.
* Clemens August Droste zu Vischering (1773–1845), Archbishop of Cologne, was brought to Minden, where he was taken under house arrest from November 1837 to April 1839; he never returned to Cologne. During the so-called Cologne confusions (), Droste zu Vischering got in trouble with the Prussian state on the question of interconfessional marriages and the independence of the Faculty of Catholic Theology at the University of Bonn.
* The physician Abraham Jacobi was born in the nearby village of Hartum and educated at the gymnasium in Minden. Though being acquitted as defendant in the Cologne Communist Trial in 1852, he was afterwards imprisoned and condemned of lese-majesty by the district court of Minden. After his release he emigrated to the US, where he became an important pediater.
* During World War I, a large prisoner-of-war camp was established in the western quarter of Minderheide. In September 1914 the first French and British soldiers were brought there, but only at the end of the year baracks were built for about 3,300 prisoners. Over the years more than 25,000 prisoners lived there. The camp was a main camp (&quot;Stammlager&quot;) with several external labour camps (&quot;Arbeitslager&quot;). Apart from British and French soldiers (including auxiliary troops from the colonies) Italians, Russians, Serbians, Croats, Poles, and Armenians were captured. The camp was dissolved after the Armistice of 11 November 1918, but the total dismantling lasted until 1922. The name (Cemetery of the French) of the nearby cemetery derives from a war memorial for French soldiers and is misleading, as the buried French, British, and Italian soldiers were transferred to their home countries after war. However, the gravesites of others, such as Russian, Serbian and Armenian, remain to date. In September 1917, Apostolic Nuncio Eugenio Pacelli visited the camp.
* Auschwitz concentration camp commander Rudolf Höss was brought to Minden after being captured by the British in Schleswig-Holstein. In Minden, he was examined in the so-called &quot;Camp Tomato&quot;, where he, for the first time, confessed the murders of millions of Jews in his camp and signed a protocol on 15 March 1946. On 31 May he was brought to Nuremberg, where he repeated the confession as witness in the Nuremberg trials.

== Demography ==
Population growth

In the region Ostwestfalen-Lippe, which is congruent to the administrative region of Detmold, Minden takes the fourth place by population after Bielefeld, Paderborn, and Gütersloh.

The earliest detailed information on population size dates to 1740. During Prussian governance, Minden as a regional capital and garrison showed a gentle population growth by officials and soldiers, and then, after defortification, by industrial workers from the surrounding region.

After World War II, Minden&#x27;s population increased significantly due to migration of expelled persons and refugees, mainly from former eastern territories of Germany. Beginning in the 1960s, population growth was mainly due to guest workers from mediterranean countries, many of whom subsequently chose to settle permanently in Minden.

Migration to Germany of ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union and its succeeding countries began in the 1980s, and the district of Minden-Lübbecke was one of their preferred regions. Then in 1989–1990, German reunification enabled migration of people from eastern Germany. The most recent migration period is due mostly to asylum seeking refugees from the Near East and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

== Religions ==
===Christians===
==== Protestant ====
The Reformation took hold in Minden between 1521 and 1529. The town contains six Protestant parishes today: St Mary&#x27;s, St Martin&#x27;s, St Mark&#x27;s, St James&#x27; and the parishes of St Peter&#x27;s and St Simeon&#x27;s Churches. They all are parts of the Church District () of Minden and belong to the Evangelical Church of Westphalia.

==== Roman Catholic ====
According to the regulations of the Peace of Westphalia, Minden Cathedral remained in Catholic possession. During the population growth in the 19th century the small number of Catholics rose slowly, and because of the migration of expelled persons, working migrants, and refugees after World War II, the percentage of Catholics increased considerably among the population of Minden.

There are four Roman Catholic parishes in Minden: the parish of the cathedral St Peter and Gorgonius, and parishes of St Mauritius, St Paul and St Ansgar, which are all bound together to the Pastoral Cooperation (&quot;Pastoralverbund&quot;) Mindener Land as part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn.

==== Other Christian Communities ====
Christian communities include the New Apostolics, the Mormons, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and others. Many of the Germans migrating from Russia and Central Asian countries belong to baptistic or mennonitic communities.

A small Quakers&#x27; community existed during the 19th century, but only their cemetery remains.

===Non-Christian Religions===
==== Jewish ====
A Jewish community has existed in Minden since 1270 and grew to around 400 members in the 19th century. After World War II the Jewish community was reconstituted and in 2020 had about 85 members. The Minden synagogue built in 1865 was destroyed in the November pogrom on 9 November 1938, so a new synagogue was inaugurated nearby in 1958.

====Muslims====
In the last half century a considerable Muslim community has grown in Minden with three mosques.

The neo-Baroque municipal theater (Stadttheater Minden) from 1908 has no ensemble, but is performance location for guest ensembles and regular symphony concerts of the North West German Philharmonic Orchestra (Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie). Since 2002 a project (&quot;Der Ring in Minden&quot;) has been running to perform all the operas of Richard Wagner.
Further theatre and cultural events occur with private sponsorship and are held in such locations as the civic centre and the . There are also theatre groups without fixed performance venues.

Minden is seat of the European Association of authors .

Minden is the original location of the nationally known amateur cabaret ; its foundation in 1966 makes it the oldest active cabaret in Germany. The town awards the prize every two years to support literary-political cabarets; the -prize is sponsored by the Melitta company as well as the local savings bank.

=== Museums ===
Minden has a municipal archive and two significant museums. The Prussia Museum () is one of two museums of Prussian history in North Rhine-Westphalia. It is quartered in old barracks on &quot;Simeonsplatz&quot; (Simeon Square). The second is the Minden Museum of History, Cultural Studies and Folklore (), housed in a Weser Renaissance style row of patrician houses (). The attached Coffee Museum (&quot;Kaffee-Museum&quot;) focuses on the 100-year-old coffee producer, Melitta.

Minden in seat of a mill association that takes care of over 40 historical mills in the surrounding district (wind-, water-, and horse mills), which have been restored as technical monuments; on Minden area two windmills are in Meißen and Dützen, and a reconstructed ship mill at the Weser shore.

The Minden Museum Railway operates with old Prussian rolling stock on the Minden District Railway tracks.

=== Buildings ===

Minden Cathedral originally dates to the 11th century, the westwerk with its entrance façade built in Romanesque style, while the early Gothic nave and aisles date from the 13th Century. Most of the old buildings around the cathedral were severely destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. The cathedral was reconstructed by architect Werner March by 1957. The nearby town hall with its picturesque 13th century arcade is a complete postwar construction in its upper floors.

The market square is surrounded by buildings in the 19th century style of historicism. The façade of house &quot;Flamme/Schmieding&quot; obtained a twice daily clock display in 2010. It features the popular origin myth of last independent Saxon leader Duke Widukind shaking hands with Charlemagne.

The main pedestrian zone in the commercial centre of Minden extends from the market place to the north (&quot;Scharn&quot;) and then turning rectangular in the Bakers&#x27; street (&quot;Bäckerstraße&quot;) eastward to the Weser. The present buildings mostly date from the late 19th century, but some show reconstructed façades in the Weser Renaissance manner. North of the Bakers&#x27; street are some 17th to 18th century half-timber framing buildings and the secularized St John&#x27;s church, now being the event location (BÜZ).
The pedestrian zone continues the market place to the south as &quot;Obermarktstraße&quot; (Upper market street) and leads to the upper town centre. Its skyline is dominated from the three churches of (from south to north) St Simeon, St Martin and St Mary, the tower of the latter being an eye-catcher over a long distance. In the southwestern part of the town centre many 16th to 18th century residential buildings have remained intact.

The upper town is accessible via a short path from the market place by the St Martin&#x27;s steps (&quot;Martinitreppe&quot;) to the St Martin&#x27;s churchyard (&quot;Martinikirchhof&quot;), today a parking area surrounded by the St Martin&#x27;s church, the Old Mint (&quot;Alte Münze&quot;), the oldest secular stone building of Minden and one of the oldest in Westphalia, the &quot;Schwedenschänke&quot; (Swedish tavern bemoaning the Swedish occupation during the Thirty Years’ War), the renewed synagogue, and the Granary (&quot;Proviant-Magazin&quot;, now used as &quot;Weser-Kolleg&quot; school) and adjacent Army Bakery (&quot;Heeresbäckerei&quot;, now used as St Martin&#x27;s parish centre) as military buildings of the 19th century. The last two buildings belong to the so-called Schinkel buildings (&quot;Schinkelbauten&quot;), as well as some buildings round the Simeon square south of the centre, for their style showing great resemblance to the manner of the famous Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel. One of the smallest buildings in Minden is the &quot;Windloch&quot; (wind hole) near St Martin&#x27;s.

Some great public buildings have been placed in the glacis area from 1880 to the very modern times: the schools &quot;Ratsgymnasium&quot;, &quot;Kurt-Tucholsky-Gesamtschule&quot;, &quot;Herder-Gymnasium&quot;, &quot;Domschule&quot;, the Centre of justice, and the former Regional Government&#x27;s building () and the neighboured old district administration building (now the local archive) both in neo-renaissance style; the new district administration building from 1977 follows to the south.

Because of its location near to the frontier between the Kingdoms of Prussia and Hanover, the railway station was strongly fortified from the beginning in 1847. Still extant are relicts of the station fortification with three forts. The station building itself is classified as an historical monument.

The picturesque (fishermens&#x27; town) lies northeast of the town centre along the Weser, where remnants of the old town fortification wall are reconstructed. In the old villages now being town quarters a lot of half-timbered houses have remained. (Haddenhausen Palace) is a 17th-century Weser Renaissance style manor house, still owned by the Bussche family, on the outskirts of the town.

The Kampa-Halle from the 1970s is a large gym-complex for sports and other events.

===Monuments and public art===

Minden contains several monuments harking back to Prussian history. The monument of the Great Elector, the only one for a sovereign in Minden, stands alongside the Weser bridgehead to commemorate its first Prussian ruler. In the glacis area, monuments are placed for the infantry brigade and the artillery regiment stationed in Minden, for the World War I deads of the pioneer battalion, and the deads of both World Wars. Another memorial is topped by a bust of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn (1778–1852), the &quot;father of gymnastics&quot;, and reminds especially at the dead gymnasts of Minden. The monument to the Battle of Minden is in the Todtenhausen quarter of the town; it commemorates the decisive victory of the forces of Great Britain and their German allies. On the Great cathedral court an obelisk-like monument, topped by the Prussian eagle, reminds at the Prussian victories in the Second Schleswig War of 1864 and the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, and a sarcophagus-like memorial in the glacis, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, at Major General &quot;Ernst Michael von Schwichow&quot; (1759–1823), fortress commander of Minden.

The &quot;Weserspucker&quot; (Weser spitter) in the pedestrian zone symbolizes the connection with the river; he is spitting in intervalls. A memorial in pyramidion-form at the Mittelland Canal reminds of &quot;Leo Sympher&quot; (1854–1922), the leading hydraulic engineer of the canal construction, and a bust at the of the Minden born astronomer &quot;Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel&quot;.

The new steel sculpture named &quot;Keilstück&quot; (Wedge piece) by artist &quot;Wilfried Hagebölling&quot;, that decorates the &quot;Martinikirchhof&quot; since 1987, has been disputed controversially in public opinion. In the early 2000s the town council decided to remove the sculpture, but caused thereby legal proceedings with the artist; finally the court of appeal confirmed the location at the original place. In January 2022 the sculpture &quot;Pegelschlange&quot; (gauge snake) is placed in the flooding area at the Weser shore.

===Parks===
The town centre is surrounded by the Glacis, a parklike green belt replacing the fortifications after their demolition. In its western part the glacis widens to a botanical garden with old tree specimens and thematic gardens on the site of the old cemetery, that was established in 1807, after burials on the old churchyards inside the town had been forbidden. In 1904 a new great cemetery was laid out in the north of the centre, and in 1957 another one in the south.

===Sport===

About 25.000 people are members of more than a hundred sport clubs, which are organized in a municipal sport association (), covering a great variety of disciplines.
The most successful club, the handball club GWD Minden, has played in the Handball-Bundesliga (national handball league) with some interruptions since the league&#x27;s founding in 1966. GWD now plays in the &quot;Kampa-Halle&quot;.

Minden has a reputation as a water sports centre with swimming, kanoe and kayak sport, and rowing, aided by its location on the Weser and the Canal. Many organizations participate in the organization of the major water sport festival &quot;Blaues Band der Weser&quot; which is held every other year.

=== &quot;Mindener Freischießen&quot; ===
The (Minden Free Shooting) is a unique public festival that takes place usually every two years. It is arranged by the military-like organized (Minden Citizen Battalion) with the (Town Major) on top. The battalion is divided into six companies, a squadron and a drummer corps, each of them headed by a captain.

In the Middle Ages the right of self-government corresponded with the duty of self-defence, and the citizen battalion was established for this purpose. Since 1682 the obligatory shooting exercises were arranged as a public festival, and as a reward the best shooter was exempted from taxation in the current year. The festival&#x27;s name refers to this rule. In 1685 the Great Elector changed the rule, so that the winner got a reward of 50 Thaler. This rule has remained to present days: now the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia as legal successor of the Prince-Elector pays the honour sum in present currency; due to the biennial rhythm two winners are determined.

The festival usually takes place in June or July from Thursday to Sunday in the town centre. The should not be confused with a marksmen&#x27;s festival.

=== Other events ===
The &quot;Mindener Messe&quot; is a one-week travelling funfair every May and every November on the wide event-place at the right Weser shore; it was founded in 1526 by the Prince-Bishop.

The takes place every summer in the quarter of Hahlen. It is an equestrian competition where the contestants try to catch a gallows-hanging garland while riding on a galloping horse in several rounds; every following round the gallows is lifted to a higher position.

Traditional Marksmen&#x27;s festivals (&quot;Schützenfest&quot;) are arranged by marksmen&#x27;s clubs () in some quarters of Minden like in many other German cities.

==Transport==
===Rail and bus===
Minden station is connecting point of the Hanover–Minden railway and the Hamm–Minden railway, which are part of the main lines connecting the Rhine-Ruhr region and Amsterdam with Berlin, and the secondary Weser-Aller Railway between Minden and Nienburg. The railway station is a stop for local and express trains such as Intercity-Express and InterCity.

Regional lines:
*RE 6 (&quot;Rhein-Weser-Express&quot;) Düsseldorf–Bielefeld–Minden,
*RE 60 (&quot;Ems-Leine-Express&quot;) / RE 70 (&quot;Weser-Leine-Express&quot;) Bielefeld/ Rheine–Minden–Hannover–Braunschweig
*RE 78 (&quot;Porta-Express&quot;) Bielefeld–Minden–Nienburg

Minden is terminal station of line S 1 of the Hanover S-Bahn to Hanover. All passenger platforms are accessible to handicapped persons.

The Minden District Railways () run two freight lines, one from Minden to Hille (Mittelland Canal port) in the west and the other one to Kleinenbremen in the east. The Minden Museum Railway () operates restored locomotives and rolling stock on these lines, in Kleinenbremen with the end at the visitors&#x27; mine.

The main station is connected by bus with the central bus terminal (, &quot;ZOB&quot;) in the town centre, where 13 bus lines rendezvous every half-hour. The local buses are coordinated with the regional buses to the other towns of the district.

===Roads===
The town lies close to the federal highways (&quot;Bundesautobahn&quot;) A 2 from Berlin to the Ruhr, and the A 30 to Amsterdam. The federal roads 61 and 65 cross in the town, the federal road 482 touches Minden as eastern ring road and connects the town with Nienburg and the next A 2-junction in Porta Westfalica. A dual carriageway connects the town to the south with Porta Wesfalica and Bad Oeynhausen. Two semicircle four-lane ring roads go around the town itself, the inner route 61 provides a town by-pass. The town centre has pay car parks and an automated guide to empty spaces.

===Waterways and harbours===

The crossing of the navigable Weser and the Mittelland Canal is an important junction of the inland waterways system. Two locks (built 1914 and 2018) connect the River with the canal to overcome a difference in height of . The multimodal transport harbours on both Weser and Mittelland Canal are experiencing increasing volume because of the good waterway connections to the seaports of Bremen, Bremerhaven, and Hamburg. A new container port is in construction to the east of the present Mittellandkanal harbour, the so-called &quot;RegioPort OWL&quot;, straddling Lower Saxony, being a seldom example of cross-State planning in the Federal Republic.

Minden hosts offices of the Waterways and Shipping Authority: Mittelland Canal / Elbe Lateral Canal () for the maintenance and regulation of these waterways. An information centre is by the Minden Aqueduct (&quot;Wasserstraßenkreuz Minden&quot;), where the canal system and the function of the locks are explained.

===Weser bridges===

The Weser is bridged over by seven overpasses: three road bridges, a railroad bridge, a pedestrian bridge, and a double aqueduct for the canal, which can be used by pedestrians, too. The main town bridge connects the town centre with the eastern suburbs and the railway station. The two relief bridges from the 1970s, the Gustav Heinemann Bridge in the north and the Theodor Heuss Bridge in the south, are four-lane and lead traffic away from town centre. A railway bridge carries the Minden District Railways&#x27; tracks over the Weser toward the main station. The Glacis bridge is a pedestrian suspension bridge that provides access to , a large parking area and event place east of the town centre.

The next nearby road bridges are south at Porta Wesfalica and north at Petershagen.

===Bicycle===
The town is touched by two long-distance cycling routes: the (Weser bicycle path) along the complete river from Hann. Münden to Cuxhaven, and starting point and terminus as well of the Westphalian Mill Route, that connects 43 historic mills along a circular route. A bike freeway from Minden to Herford (&quot;Radschnellweg RS 3&quot;) is under construction.

The railway station sports a bike station. The town belongs to a working cooperative of bicycle-friendly communities in North Rhine-Westphalia aiming for bikes to exceed 20% of traffic.

===Hiking===
Minden lies on the &quot;Wittekindsweg&quot; (Wittekind&#x27;s path), part of the E11 European long distance path from The Hague to Tallinn, and on the regional pilgrims&#x27; route &quot;Sigwardsweg&quot;, named in memory of Bishop Sigward (1120–1140).

A planet walk from Simeon square along the western Weser shore to the north symbolizes the planetary distances in the Solar System; it was established in 1996, when Pluto was yet regarded as planet, and therefore has a length of .

==Economy and infrastructure==
===Economy===
For a long time, Minden&#x27;s economic development was hindered by the constraints of the fortress. In 1873, the fortress was dissolved, allowing the city and its economy to expand beyond its borders. Today, the city is home of about 3,600 businesses.

Agriculture still occupies 50% of the administrative bounds, which have little changed. This is slightly more than the state average and much more than in the densely populated areas of the state.

The average income in Minden is slightly below the average of the Minden-Lübbecke district and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Thus, Minden ranks 309th out of 396 municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia in terms of purchasing power.


Minden is the economic centre of the district and the bordering region of Lower Saxony. It is part of an agglomeration corridor that extends along the A 2 Autobahn from Minden through Herford, Bielefeld, Gütersloh and on to the Ruhr area. Traffic connections by railway, highway, federal routes, and waterways are favourable factors for growing industry and trade with about 3,300 firms and 40,000 employees in regular conditions (2020). A multitude of economic branches include the chemical, metalworking, electronic, paper, ceramic, and woodworking spheres, located on industrial areas mainly in the west and east parts of the town.

According to the three-sector model, the Minden employees work in the primary sector (agriculture, forestry) at 0.1%, in the secondary sector (industrial production) at 27.6%, and in the tertiary sector (mainly service and administration) at 72.4%; these numbers are roughly in accordance to the average of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The number of about 28,000 daily commuters exceeds the 17,000 citizens of Minden, who work outside the town&#x27;s limits. The disposable income per capita amounts slowly below to the average of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Like in other towns, some great retail areas have deloped apart from the centre in the outer parts of the town. A very special problem of Minden results from the local government reorganization of 1973, when most of the surrounding suburbs were adjointed to the town administratively. The southern suburbs of Barkhausen and Neesen however became parts of the new founded town of Porta Westfalica, that since then has developed a large trading estate (&quot;Porta Markt&quot;) in the most northwestern part of its quarter Barkhausen, directly to the border of Minden. The now established shopping scene is situated extremely marginally in the Porta Westfalica area, but the distance to Minden town centre is only ; by the federal route 65 even parts of the western community of Hille and the eastern town of Bückeburg are in the 15-minute radius.

====Enterprises====
Minden is location of several middle-sized companies without a dominating industrial branch. As it is typical for the East Westphalian economy, most of the Minden firms are small or middle-sized and often yet in ownership of the founder&#x27;s family. No Minden firm is listed in the German premium stock indices DAX and MDAX, neither in the small-company index SDAX or the TecDAX for technological companies. Most of the greater firms have the status of private limited legal entities (&quot;Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung&quot;) or partnerships (&quot;Kommanditgesellschaft&quot;).

Melitta with headquarters in Minden is well known by consumers for its coffee products. The &quot;Strothmann&quot; corn brandy of rye distilled liquor is produced here by the &quot;Wilhelm Strothmann destilleries&quot; that is now part of the &quot;Berentzen&quot; group.

&quot;Siegfried PharmaChemikalien Minden&quot; (former &quot;Knoll AG&quot; and lateron part of the BASF, now subsidiary of &quot;Siegfried AG&quot; in Switzerland) produces pharmacy chemicals as ephedrine, coffein and theophylline. Another notable firm is &quot;Follmann&quot;, which produces special dyes and adhesives. &quot;Ornamin Kunststoffwerke&quot; is a designer and producer of innovative plastic utensils like tableware and &quot;To Go&quot;-vessels, located in Minden since 1955.

The &quot;Harting Technology Group&quot;, an electronics company originally founded in 1945, built an administration centre near to a former Prussian barracks area in the Glacis belt; the main locations of production were moved since 1950 to the nearby towns of Espelkamp and Rahden. WAGO Kontakttechnik has its main location in the north of the town centre and produces connector products for the electric and electronic industry. &quot;Schoppe und Faeser&quot; was a producer of electronics that has been taken over by the ABB Group. &quot;Rose &amp; Krieger&quot;, a subsidiary of Phoenix Mecano, produces technical components. The over 100-year-old Altendorf GmbH firm produces machine tools including the world leading circular trim saws.

The German retail food corporation Edeka has a regional office and distribution centre (&quot;Edeka Minden-Hannover&quot;) in Minden. The office is responsible for a large zone from the North Sea to north-east Germany including local branches of its 100%-subsidiary, low-price supermarket &quot;NP-Markt&quot;, as some functions of retailer WEZ (25% ownership).

The &quot;DB Systemtechnik&quot; (German railway system technology) deals with the development of rail vehicles and railway system equipment.

The regional savings bank &quot;Sparkasse Minden-Lübbecke&quot; has its main administration in Minden.

===Media===
The only local daily newspaper is the &quot;Mindener Tageblatt&quot;. The WDR (West German Broadcast) studio in Bielefeld provides a regional public broadcast, supporting the region of East Westphalia-Lippe with both radio and television programs. The TV transmission has its regional antenna on the Jakobsberg near Minden. The private radio station &quot;Radio Westfalica&quot; is part of the &quot;Radio-NRW&quot; group and transmits a local program from Minden focused on the District Minden-Lübbecke.

===Public services and establishments===

The administration offices of the district of Minden-Lübbecke are in the (district building) near to the water affairs section of Detmold, its town presence.

<text>141 Lumen is a carbonaceous asteroid from the intermediate asteroid belt, approximately 130 kilometers in diameter. It is an identified Eunomian interloper.

== Description ==

It was discovered on January 13, 1875, by the brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry, but Paul is the one who was given the credit for this discovery. It is named for &quot;&quot;, a book by the astronomer Camille Flammarion.

Richard Binzel and Schelte Bus further added to the knowledge about this asteroid in a light-curve survey published in 2003. This project was known as Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey, Phase II or SMASSII, which built on a previous survey of the main-belt asteroids. The visible-wavelength (0.435–0.925 micrometre) spectra data was gathered between August 1993 and March 1999.

Lightcurve data has also been recorded by observers at the Antelope Hill Observatory, which has been designated as an official observatory by the Minor Planet Center.

<text>The small sword or smallsword (also court sword, Gaelic: or claybeg, French: , lit. “Sword of the court”) is a light one-handed sword designed for thrusting which evolved out of the longer and heavier rapier (&quot;espada ropera&quot;) of the late Renaissance. The height of the small sword&#x27;s popularity was during the 18th century, when any civilian or soldier with pretensions to gentlemanly status would have worn a small sword daily.

The blade of a small sword is comparatively short at around , though some reach over . It usually tapers to a sharp point but may lack a cutting edge. It is typically triangular in cross-section, although some of the early examples still have the rhombic and spindle-shaped cross-sections inherited from older weapons, like the rapier. This triangular cross-section may be hollow ground for additional lightness. Many small swords of the period between the 17th and 18th centuries were found with colichemarde blades.

It is thought to have appeared in France and spread quickly across the rest of Europe. The small sword was the immediate predecessor of the French duelling sword (from which the épée developed) and its method of use—as typified in the works of such authors as Sieur de Liancour, Domenico Angelo, Monsieur J. Olivier and Monsieur L&#x27;Abbat—developed into the techniques of the French classical school of fencing. The small sword was mainly used as a duelling weapon.

Militarily, small swords continued to be used as a standard sidearm for infantry officers. In some branches with strong traditions, this practice continues to the modern day, albeit for ceremonial and formal dress only. The carrying of swords by officers in battle was rare after the nineteenth century. The 1913 U.S. Army Manual of Bayonet Drill includes instructions for how to defend against an opponent with a smallsword.
Bayonets of the period, such as the British Pattern 1907 bayonet, were relatively long with total lengths of or more not uncommon. While a little larger, a smallsword could be carried in a very similar manner and would not appear out of place.

==Hilt==
The small sword guard is typically of the &quot;shell&quot; type, sometimes with two lobes that were decorated as clam shells. The shells were often replaced with a simple curved oval disk, which was still referred to as the (shell). In later foils, the lobed type evolved into the or figure-8 guard, and the disk became the modern foil &quot;bell&quot; guard, but the guards were still referred to as . Small swords with this type of guard normally included other features of the older rapier hilt, including quillons, ricasso, knuckle-bow, and a , although these were often atrophied beyond the point of usefulness, serving mainly as a decorative element. However, they were maintained in a usable state on some weapons, including the Italian foil, into the 20th century.

In the 19th century, simple cross-hilt small swords were also produced, largely as ceremonial weapons that were evocative of more ancient types of weapons. An example is the Model 1840 Army Noncommissioned Officers&#x27; Sword, which is still used by the United States Army on ceremonial occasions. As the wearing of swords fell out of fashion and the small sword evolved into the duelling sword (forerunner of the modern épée), the older hilts gave way to simpler grips such as the French grip and Italian grip.

==Use==
Small swords were used both by the military (where they served more as a sign of a certain rank rather than a real weapon for close combat) and as a dueling weapon. The very height of the small sword&#x27;s widespread popularity was in the 18th century, when it was considered fashionable by aristocrats (&quot;no gentleman was dressed without his sword&quot; – contemporary idiom of the middle of the 18th century), but it was still used as a duelling weapon until the middle of the 20th century. For instance, Gaston Defferre and René Ribière used larger and heavier versions of the épée, which both had small sword-blades instead of the flexible épée-blades (which have been used in sport fencing through the present day) in their duel on April 21, 1967, in Neuilly, Paris. The use of the small sword for infantry is covered in the US manual of 1861 titled &quot;The Militiaman&#x27;s Manual&quot;.

In modern times, the sword is often used as part of court uniform and dress. A German version of the small sword called (&quot;mourning épée&quot;) is still in use by the of the city of Hamburg in Germany.

<text>Paul-Pierre Henry (21 August 1848 – 4 January 1905) and his brother Prosper-Mathieu Henry (10 December 1849 – 25 July 1903) were French opticians and astronomers.

They made refracting telescopes and instruments for observatories, and were involved in the origin of the &quot;Carte du Ciel&quot; project.

Between the two of them, they discovered a total of 14 asteroids. The Minor Planet Center credits their discoveries under &quot;P. P. Henry&quot; and &quot;P. M. Henry&quot;, respectively. The lunar crater Henry Frères (Henry brothers) and the Martian crater &quot;Henry&quot; are named after them. They were jointly awarded the first Valz Prize in 1877 for their sky charts designed to facilitate the search for minor planets.

<text>The Carte du Ciel (; literally, &#x27;Map of the Sky&#x27;) and the Astrographic Catalogue (or Astrographic Chart) were two distinct but connected components of a massive international astronomical project, initiated in the late 19th century, to catalogue and map the positions of millions of stars as faint as 11th or 12th magnitude. Twenty observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 (glass) photographic plates in an enormous observing programme extending over several decades. Despite, or because of, its vast scale, the project was only ever partially successful – the Carte du Ciel component was never completed, and for almost half a century the Astrographic Catalogue part was largely ignored. However, the appearance of the Hipparcos Catalogue in 1997 has led to an important development in the use of this historical plate material.

==Origins and goals==

A vast and unprecedented international star-mapping project was initiated in 1887 by Paris Observatory director Amédée Mouchez, who realized the potential of the new dry plate photographic process to revolutionize the process of making maps of the stars. As a result of the Astrographic Congress of more than 50 astronomers held in Paris in April 1887, 20 observatories from around the world agreed to participate in the project, and two goals were established:

For the first, the Astrographic Catalogue, the entire sky was to be photographed to 11 mag to provide a reference catalogue of star positions that would fill the magnitude gap between those previously observed by transit and meridian circle instrument observations down to 8 mag – this would provide the positions of a reasonably dense network of star positions which could in turn be used as a reference system for the fainter survey component (the Carte du Ciel). Different observatories around the world were charged with surveying specific declination zones (see table). The Astrographic Catalogue plates, of typically 6 minutes exposure, were in due course photographed, measured, and published in their entirety. They yielded a catalogue of positions and magnitudes down to about 11.5 mag, and the programme was largely completed during the first quarter of the 20th century.

For the second goal, a second set of plates, with longer exposures but minimal overlap, was to photograph all stars to 14 mag. These plates were to be reproduced and distributed as a set of charts, the Carte du Ciel, in contrast to previous sky charts which had been constructed from the celestial coordinates of stars observed by transit instruments. Most of the Carte du Ciel plates used three exposures of 20 minutes duration, displaced to form an equilateral triangle with sides of 10 arcsec, making it easy to distinguish stars from plate flaws, and asteroids from stars.

A contemporary account of this vast international astronomical collaboration, published in 1912, was given by Herbert Hall Turner, then Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford University. Other aspects are covered in various papers in the Proceedings of IAU Symposium Number 133 held in 1988.

== The Astrographic Catalogue ==

For the Astrographic Catalogue, 20 observatories from around the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 glass plates (see table). Around half of the observatories ordered telescopes from the Henry brothers (Paul and Prosper) in France, with others coming from the factory of Howard Grubb of Dublin. These telescopes were termed &quot;normal astrographs&quot; with an aperture of around 13 inches (33 cm) and a focal length of 11 feet (3.4 m) designed to create images with a uniform scale on the photographic plate of approximately 60 arcsecs/mm while covering a 2° × 2° field of view. Each observatory was assigned a specific declination zone to photograph. The first such plate was taken in August 1891 at the Vatican Observatory (where the exposures took more than 27 years to complete), and the last in December 1950 at the Royal Observatory of Belgium (Brussels), with most observations being made between 1895 and 1920. To compensate for plate defects, each area of the sky was photographed twice, using a two-fold, corner-to-centre overlap pattern, extended at the zone boundaries, such that each observatory&#x27;s plates would overlap with those of the adjacent zones. The participating observatories agreed to use a standardized telescope so that all plates had a similar scale of approximately 60 arcsec/mm. The measurable areas of the plates were 2.1°×2.1° (13 cm×13 cm), so the overlap pattern consisted of plates that were centred on every degree band in declination, but offset in right ascension by two degrees. Many factors, such as reference catalogue, reduction technique and print formats were left up to the individual institutions. The positional accuracy goal was 0.5 arcsec per image.
Plate measurement was a protracted affair, with measuring done by eye and recorded by hand. The plates were turned over to a large number of people working as computers to determine the positions of the stars on each plate. (Before its modern meaning, the word &quot;computer&quot; meant a person who performs calculations). These human computers would manually measure each star with respect to the dozen or so reference stars within that particular plate, and then perform calculations to determine the star&#x27;s right ascension and declination. The original goal of 11 mag for the limiting magnitude was generally surpassed, however, with some observatories routinely measuring stars as faint as 13 mag. In total, some 4.6 million stars (8.6 million images) were observed. The brightest stars were over-exposed on the plates, not measured, and therefore missing in the resulting catalogues. The plate measurements (as rectangular coordinates), as well as the formulae to transform them to equatorial coordinates, were published in the original volumes of the Astrographic Catalogue, although the accompanying equatorial coordinates are now of only historical interest. Publication of the measurements proceeded from 1902 to 1964, and resulted in 254 printed volumes of raw data. 
For decades the Astrographic Catalogue was largely ignored. The data were difficult to work with because they were available neither in machine-readable form nor in equatorial coordinates. Decades of labour were expended internationally before the project was superseded by modern astronomical techniques. One problem was that the work took much longer than expected. As originally envisaged, the project was meant to have taken only 10 to 15 years. A more serious problem was that while many European astronomers were preoccupied with this project, which required steady, methodical labor rather than creativity, in other parts of the world notably the United States astrophysics was becoming far more important than astrometry. As a result, French astronomy in particular fell behind and lagged for decades.

==The Carte du Ciel==
The still-more-ambitious Carte du Ciel component of the programme was undertaken by some of the participating observatories, but neither completed nor even started by others. The charts proved to be excessively expensive to photograph and reproduce, generally via engraved copper plates (photogravure), and many zones were either not completed or properly published. The plates which were taken generally still exist, but cover only half of the sky. They are typically archived at their original observatories. A very few plates have recently been re-measured and re-analysed with the availability of the Hipparcos Catalogue data (see below).

==Combination of the Astrographic Catalogue with Hipparcos==

The vast amount of work invested in the Astrographic Catalogue, taking plates, measuring, and publishing, was looked at for a long time as giving only a marginal scientific profit. But today, astronomers are very much indebted to this great effort because of the possibility of combining these century-old star positions with the results from ESA&#x27;s Hipparcos space astrometry satellite, allowing high accuracy proper motions to be derived for 2.5 million stars. 

Specifically, the Astrographic Catalogue positions were transferred from the decades-old printed catalogues into machine readable form (undertaken at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute in Moscow under the leadership of A. Kuzmin) between 1987 and 1994. The data was then reduced anew (at the US Naval Observatory in Washington under the leadership of Sean Urban), using the reference stars measured by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite. 

The stars from the Hipparcos Catalogue were used to establish a detailed reference framework at the various epochs of the Astrographic Catalogue plates, while the 2.5 million stars in the Tycho-2 Catalogue provided a dense reference framework to allow the plate distortions to be accurately calibrated and corrected. The proper motions of all the Tycho Catalogue stars could then be derived especially thanks to the Astrographic Catalogue, but additionally using star positions from more than 140 other ground-based catalogues. 

Aside from the 120,000 stars of the Hipparcos Catalogue itself, the resulting Tycho-2 Catalogue (compiled at the Copenhagen University Observatory under the leadership of Erik Høg) became the largest, most accurate and most complete, star catalogue of the brightest stars on the sky. It was the basis for deriving positions for all fainter stars on the sky, until the Gaia 2 Catalog became available in 2017. Sean Urban of the US Naval Observatory wrote in 1998: &quot;The history of the Astrographic Catalogue endeavour is one of dedicated individuals devoting tedious decades of their careers to a single goal. Some believe it is also the story of how the best European observatories of the 19th century lost their leadership in astronomical research by committing so many resources to this one undertaking. Long portrayed as an object lesson in overambition, the Astrographic Catalogue has more recently turned into a lesson in the way that old data can find new uses.&quot;

<text>West Pomeranian Voivodeship is a voivodeship (province) in northwestern Poland. Its capital and largest city is Szczecin. Its area equals , and in 2021, it was inhabited by 1,682,003 people.

It was established on 1 January 1999, out of the former Szczecin and Koszalin Voivodeships and parts of Gorzów, Piła and Słupsk Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. It borders on Pomeranian Voivodeship to the east, Greater Poland Voivodeship to the southeast, Lubusz Voivodeship to the south, the German federal-states of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and Brandenburg to the west, and the Baltic Sea to the north.

==Geography and tourism==

West Pomeranian Voivodeship is the fifth largest voivodeship of Poland in terms of area. The largest cities in the region are the capital Szczecin, as well as Koszalin, Stargard, Kołobrzeg and Świnoujście.

This is a picturesque region of the Baltic Sea coast, with many beaches, lakes and woodlands. Szczecin, Świnoujście and Police are important ports. Other major seaside towns include Międzyzdroje, Dziwnów, Kołobrzeg, and Mielno.

West Pomerania is considered one of the greenest regions of Poland, and one of the most attractive for tourists. It is characterized by incredible diversity of the landscape: beaches, hundreds of lakes, and forests full of wildlife (e.g. Wkrzanska Forest), spreading mainly up the hills of the glacial lakes areas, and Poland&#x27;s two largest islands, Wolin and Usedom.
West Pomerania is also rich in various forms and styles of architecture that were built during the Middle Ages as well as the Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque periods. Darłowo, the birthplace of Eric of Pomerania, King of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, contains a preserved old town with the Gothic Our Lady of Częstochowa church, which holds the king&#x27;s sarcophagus. The St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Stargard and Saint John Co-Cathedral in Kamień Pomorski are considered two of the most precious Gothic churches of entire Poland, and as such are listed as Historic Monuments of Poland, whereas the Saint Stanislaus Kostka church in Chwarszczany is a nationally unique former Knights Templar church. In Cedynia, the westernmost town of Poland, there is a memorial commemorating the Battle of Cedynia of 972, the oldest recorded battle in the history of Poland. The Świnoujście Lighthouse is the tallest brick lighthouse in the world. The War Cemetery in Stargard is the burial place of over 5,000 Allied soldiers and prisoners of war from both world wars, including Polish, French, Serbian/Yugoslav, Russian/Soviet, Italian, Romanian, Belgian, British, Moroccan, Portuguese and Dutch. There are also numerous World War II memorials, including memorials to Allied POWs from World War II at the former Oflag II-B, Oflag II-D and Stalag Luft IV German POW camps in Choszczno, Kłomino and Tychowo, and a memorial to British pilots of the No. 617 Squadron RAF shot down by Germany in Karsibór, Świnoujście.

There is a diverse repertoire of theaters, festivals, museums and galleries. During a few-day long annual Sea Festival in Szczecin, a number of free open-air concerts take place. In Świnoujście during the summer, the FAMA Academic Youth Arts Festival takes place – an event with several years of tradition, which attracts not only young people but also older alumni. In Międzyzdroje, there is a Festival Of The Stars, which draws many popular actors. In Wolin, a Viking Festival takes place, which draws &quot;Vikings&quot; from all across Europe.

Another draw to the area is a wide array of health resorts. Brine and peloid, discovered in the 19th century, together with geothermal water resources, are popular attractions in Świnoujście, Kamień Pomorski and Połczyn Zdrój.

A notable phenomenon on a worldly scale is the Crooked Forest outside the town of Gryfino.

== Cities and towns ==



The voivodeship contains five cities and 61 towns. These are listed below in descending order of population (according to official figures for 2019):
The Polish districts of the historical region Western Pomerania (the three westernmost districts of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship) had a population of about 520,000 in 2012 (cities of Szczecin, Świnoujście and Police County combined) – while the German districts had a population of about 470,000 in 2012 (Vorpommern-Rügen and Vorpommern-Greifswald combined). Overall, about 1 million people live in the historical region of Western Pomerania today, while the Szczecin agglomeration reaches even further.

== Administrative division ==
West Pomeranian Voivodeship is divided into 21 counties (powiats): three city counties and 18 land counties. These are further divided into 114 gminas.

The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population in 2019):

==Protected areas==

Protected areas in West Pomeranian Voivodeship include two National Parks and seven Landscape Parks. These are listed below.
*Drawno National Park (partly in Lubusz and Greater Poland Voivodeships)
*Wolin National Park
*Barlinek-Gorzów Landscape Park (partly in Lubusz Voivodeship)
*Cedynia Landscape Park
*Drawsko Landscape Park
*Ińsko Landscape Park
*Lower Odra Valley Landscape Park
*Szczecin Landscape Park
*Ujście Warty Landscape Park (partly in Lubusz Voivodeship)

==Cuisine==
Apart from nationwide Polish cuisine, the region has its local traditional foods and beverages. The voivodeship is notable for production of honey, with several varieties listed as traditional foods by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland.

As a coastal province, there are several local fish dishes, including the Szczecin-style and Kołobrzeg-style herring. Szczecinek krówki, Szczecin gingerbread and Choszczno strucla (type of poppy seed roll) are local delicacies.

Traditional beverages include mead, produced in Cedynia and Wolin, beer from Lipiany and Szczecin and nalewka from Dębina.

== Demographics ==
After Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the region became again part of Poland by way of the Potsdam Agreement, which created territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union.

In 1948, 67 percent of the populace originated from central Poland, Greater Poland and Pomerelia while 25 percent came from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. Another 6 percent returned to Poland from Western Europe. About 50,000 Ukrainians were forcefully resettled to West Pomerania in the Operation Vistula in 1947.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, some Scots settled in several towns of the current West Pomeranian Voivodeship, i.e. Wałcz, Biały Bór, Człopa and Gryfice, whereas in the 18th century French Huguenots settled in Szczecin and Gryfino.

== Transportation ==

There are two main international road routes that pass through the voivodeship: National road 3 (Poland) Świnoujście-Szczecin-Gorzów Wielkopolski-Zielona Góra-Legnica-Czech border (part of European route E65 from Swedish Malmö to Chaniá in Greece) and National road 6 (Poland) Szczecin-Koszalin-Słupsk-Gdańsk (part of European route E28 from Berlin to Minsk). 
Most of the National road 3 in the voivodeship is in a standard of an expressway (Expressway S3 (Poland)). The National road 6 between German border and Rzęśnica is in the standard of autostrada (A6 autostrada (Poland)), whereas part between Rzęścnica and Goleniów and bypasses of Goleniów and Nowogard are in standards of an expressway (Expressway S6 (Poland)).
Other important national roads are National road 10 (Poland) (German border-Szczecin-Piła-Bydgoscz-Toruń-Płońsk) and National road 11 (Poland) (Kołobrzeg-Koszalin-Piła-Poznań-Bytom).
Apart from the above, some other national roads are located in the voivodeship. The voivodeship possesses also a well-developed network of regional roads.

Main railways in the province are line no. 351 Szczecin-Poznań, line no. 273 Szczecin-Wrocław (so-called &quot;Odra railway&quot;), line no. 202 Stargard-Gdańsk, line no. 401 Szczecin-Świnoujście and line no. 404 Kołobrzeg-Szczecinek.
The main railway stations of the province are Szczecin main station, Stargard and Koszalin. The stations are served by fast PKP Intercity trains which connect them with the capital Warsaw, as well as other major Polish cities. 
In addition to these fast express services, inter-regional trains and intra-regional trains are operated by the firm Przewozy Regionalne.
Szczecin main station possesses international train connections with Berlin, Schwerin and Lübeck (operated by DB Regio). Świnoujście has a direct train connection with Stralsund, which is operated by Usedomer Bäderbahn.

The only domestic and international airport in West Pomeranian Voivodeship is Szczecin-Goleniów &quot;Solidarność&quot; Airport. Also, part of the runway of an abandoned airport in Bagicz (near Kołobrzeg) was converted to an airport licensed to service planes carrying not more than 20 passengers on board.

==Sports==

Football and basketball enjoy the largest following in the voivodeship.
==Curiosities==

*In the 10th and 11th centuries, Wolin was one of five largest cities of Poland, and the largest port city on the Baltic Sea.
*Darłowo, Sławno, Szczecin and Szczecinek were medieval ducal seats of the House of Griffin.
*The West Pomeranian Voivodeship is one of four first-level administrative divisions containing the name of the region of Pomerania, the other being the Pomeranian Voivodeship and Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship in Poland, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany.

<text>The cubit is an ancient unit of length based on the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. It was primarily associated with the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Israelites. The term &quot;cubit&quot; is found in the Bible regarding Noah&#x27;s Ark, the Ark of the Covenant, the Tabernacle, and Solomon&#x27;s Temple. The &quot;common cubit&quot; was divided into 6 palms × 4 fingers = 24 digits. &quot;Royal cubits&quot; added a palm for 7 palms × 4 fingers = 28 digits. These lengths typically ranged from , with an ancient Roman cubit being as long as .

Cubits of various lengths were employed in many parts of the world in antiquity, during the Middle Ages and as recently as early modern times. The term is still used in hedgelaying, the length of the forearm being frequently used to determine the interval between stakes placed within the hedge.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;cubit&quot; comes from the Latin noun &quot;elbow&quot;, from the verb &quot;to lie down&quot;, from which also comes the adjective &quot;&quot;.

==Ancient Egyptian royal cubit==

The ancient Egyptian royal cubit () is the earliest attested standard measure. Cubit rods were used for the measurement of length. A number of these rods have survived: two are known from the tomb of Maya, the treasurer of the 18th dynasty pharaoh Tutankhamun, in Saqqara; another was found in the tomb of Kha (TT8) in Thebes. Fourteen such rods, including one double cubit rod, were described and compared by Lepsius in 1865. These cubit rods range from in length and are divided into seven palms; each palm is divided into four fingers, and the fingers are further subdivided.
Early evidence for the use of this royal cubit comes from the Early Dynastic Period: on the Palermo Stone, the flood level of the Nile river during the reign of the Pharaoh Djer is given as measuring 6 cubits and 1 palm. Use of the royal cubit is also known from Old Kingdom architecture, from at least as early as the construction of the Step Pyramid of Djoser designed by Imhotep in around 2700 BC.

==Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement==

Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement originated in the loosely organized city-states of Early Dynastic Sumer. Each city, kingdom and trade guild had its own standards until the formation of the Akkadian Empire when Sargon of Akkad issued a common standard. This standard was improved by Naram-Sin, but fell into disuse after the Akkadian Empire dissolved. The standard of Naram-Sin was readopted in the Ur III period by the Nanše Hymn which reduced a plethora of multiple standards to a few agreed upon common groupings. Successors to Sumerian civilization including the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Persians continued to use these groupings.

The Classical Mesopotamian system formed the basis for Elamite, Hebrew, Urartian, Hurrian, Hittite, Ugaritic, Phoenician, Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian, Arabic, and Islamic metrologies. The Classical Mesopotamian System also has a proportional relationship, by virtue of standardized commerce, to Bronze Age Harappan and Egyptian metrologies.

In 1916, during the last years of the Ottoman Empire and in the middle of World War I, the German assyriologist Eckhard Unger found a copper-alloy bar while excavating at Nippur. The bar dates from and Unger claimed it was used as a measurement standard. This irregularly formed and irregularly marked graduated rule supposedly defined the Sumerian cubit as about .

There is some evidence that cubits were used to measure angular separation. The Babylonian Astronomical Diary for 568–567 BCE refers to Jupiter being one cubit behind the elbow of Sagittarius. One cubit measures about 2 degrees.

== Late Assyrian cubits ==
Ancient Assyrian units of measure appear to exhibit significant variability. However, based on analysis of careful measurement of sculptured slabs and figures from Khorsabad, dating to the time of Sargon II, now held in Western museums, it appears that standard measures did exist. This analysis, together with information from cuneiform documents from the period, confirm the existence of three Late Assyrian cubits or &quot;kus&quot; as the measure was called in Assyrian literature: 

* The &quot;standard cubit&quot; (approximately ), used in most normal situations.
* The &quot;big cubit&quot; () is believed to have been reserved for representations of religious and mythological beings.
* The rare &quot;cubit of the king&quot; () is believed to have been used for representations of the king.

==Biblical cubit==

The standard of the cubit () in different countries and in different ages has varied. This realization led the rabbis of the 2nd century CE to clarify the length of their cubit, saying that the measure of the cubit of which they have spoken &quot;applies to the cubit of middle-size&quot;. In this case, the requirement is to make use of a standard 6 handbreadths to each cubit, and which handbreadth was not to be confused with an outstretched palm, but rather one that was clenched and which handbreadth has the standard width of 4 fingerbreadths (each fingerbreadth being equivalent to the width of a thumb, about 2.25 cm). This puts the handbreadth at roughly , and 6 handbreadths (1 cubit) at . Epiphanius of Salamis, in his treatise &quot;On Weights and Measures&quot;, describes how it was customary, in his day, to take the measurement of the biblical cubit: &quot;The cubit is a measure, but it is taken from the measure of the forearm. For the part from the elbow to the wrist and the palm of the hand is called the cubit, the middle finger of the cubit measure being also extended at the same time and there being added below (it) the span, that is, of the hand, taken all together.&quot;

Rabbi Avraham Chaim Naeh put the linear measurement of a cubit at . Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz (the &quot;Chazon Ish&quot;), dissenting, put the length of a cubit at .

Rabbi and philosopher Maimonides, following the Talmud, makes a distinction between the cubit of 6 handbreadths used in ordinary measurements, and the cubit of 5 handbreadths used in measuring the Golden Altar, the base of the altar of burnt offerings, its circuit and the horns of the altar.

== Ancient Greece ==
In ancient Greek units of measurement, the standard forearm cubit measured approximately The short forearm cubit from the knuckle of the middle finger (i.e., fist clenched) to the elbow, measured approximately .

==Ancient Rome==
In ancient Rome, according to Vitruvius, a cubit was equal to Roman feet or 6 palm widths (approximately ). A 120-centimetre cubit (approximately four feet long), called the Roman ulna, was common in the Roman empire, which cubit was measured from the fingers of the outstretched arm opposite the man&#x27;s hip.; also, with

==Islamic world==
In the Islamic world, the cubit () had a similar origin, being originally defined as the arm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. Several different cubit lengths were current in the medieval Islamic world for the unit of length, ranging from , and in turn the was commonly subdivided into six handsbreadths (), and each handsbreadth into four fingerbreadths (). The most commonly used definitions were:
* the legal cubit (), also known as the hand cubit (), cubit of Yusuf (, named after the 8th-century Abu Yusuf), postal cubit (), &quot;freed&quot; cubit () and thread cubit (). It measured , although in the Abbasid Caliphate it measured , possibly as a result of reforms of Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun ().
* the black cubit (), adopted in the Abbasid period and fixed by the measure used in the Nilometer on Rawda Island at . It is also known as the common cubit (), sack-cloth cubit (), and was the most commonly used in the Maghreb and Islamic Spain under the name .
* the king&#x27;s cubit (), inherited from the Sassanid Persians. It measured eight for a total of on average. It was this measure used by Ziyad ibn Abihi for his survey of Iraq, and is hence also known as Ziyadi cubit () or survey cubit (). From Caliph al-Mansur () it was also known as the Hashemite cubit (). Other identical measures were the work cubit () and likely also the , which measures .
* the cloth cubit, which fluctuated widely according to region: the Egyptian cubit ( or ) measured , that of Damascus , that of Aleppo , that of Baghdad , and that of Istanbul .

A variety of more local or specific cubit measures were developed over time: the &quot;small&quot; Hashemite cubit of , also known as the cubit of Bilal (, named after the 8th-century Basran Bilal ibn Abi Burda); the Egyptian carpenter&#x27;s cubit () or architect&#x27;s cubit () of , reduced and standardized to in the 19th century; the house cubit () of , introduced by the Abbasid-era Ibn Abi Layla; the cubit of Umar () of and its double, the scale cubit () established by al-Ma&#x27;mun and used mainly for measuring canals.

In medieval and early modern Persia, the cubit (usually known as ) was either the legal cubit of , or the Isfahan cubit of . A royal cubit () appeared in the 17th century with , while a &quot;shortened&quot; cubit () of (likely derived from the widely used cloth cubit of Aleppo) was used for cloth. The measure survived into the 20th century, with 1 equal to . Mughal India also had its own royal cubit () of .

==Other systems==
Other measurements based on the length of the forearm include some lengths of ell, the Russian lokot (), the Indian , the Thai , the Malay , the Tamil , the Telugu (), the Khmer , and the Tibetan ().

==Cubit arm in heraldry==

A cubit arm in heraldry may be &quot;dexter&quot; or &quot;sinister&quot;. It may be &quot;vested&quot; (with a sleeve) and may be shown in various positions, most commonly &quot;erect&quot;, but also &quot;fesswise&quot; (horizontal), &quot;bendwise&quot; (diagonal) and is often shown grasping objects. It is most often used erect as a crest, for example by the families of Poyntz of Iron Acton, Rolle of Stevenstone and Turton.

<text>Brian Weir Henderson (15 September 1931 – 5 August 2021) was a New Zealand-born Australian radio and television personality and pioneer known for his association with the Nine Network as a television news anchor in Sydney, as well as a variety show presenter and host of music program &quot;Bandstand&quot;, the local version of the US music program &quot;American Bandstand&quot;.
Henderson, who started his career in radio, went on to become a long-serving Australian newsreader for 45 years, having presented the news bulletins for Sydney station TCN-9, either on weekends or weeknights, from 14 January 1957 until retiring from TCN-9 on 29 November 2002. His role as weeknight presenter at the time was subsequently given to Jim Waley. TCN-9 bulletins would eventually be relayed to regional New South Wales through Nine&#x27;s regional affiliate WIN Television.

==Biography==
===Early life and career in New Zealand===
Henderson was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, on 15 September 1931. His father worked as a bus driver and a pastry cook, and served in World War II. Henderson grew up in the South Island, and attended Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School. He caught tuberculosis while in high school and spent three years recovering in a hospital. During this time, his interest in broadcasting was piqued when he became resident announcer and disc jockey of the hospital&#x27;s radio station. He started working for 4ZB when he was 16 years old, initially as a copywriter, before becoming the country&#x27;s youngest DJ.

===Career in Australia===
Henderson moved to Australia in 1953 and settled in Sydney, New South Wales. He first worked for radio station 2CH before switching to television. After joining the Nine Network, he started presenting &quot;Nine News&quot; in Sydney from 1957, four months after it was established. He went on to host the music variety program &quot;Bandstand&quot; from 1958 until 1972.

From his first news broadcast in January 1957, Henderson used the tagline &quot;...and that&#x27;s the way it is&quot;, or &quot;the way it is&quot;, followed by the date of the broadcast, to sign off after every bulletin, similar to United States newsreader Walter Cronkite.

At the end of his final bulletin, Henderson&#x27;s voice wavered as he told viewers it was time to watch the news, not present it: Not the way it was, as has been suggested, but for the last time, the way it is, this Friday the 29th of November, this is Brian Henderson, a sad Brian Henderson, saying not good night, this time, but goodbye.

A pair of Henderson&#x27;s familiar dark-rimmed spectacles, worn while reading the news, are in the collection of the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney.

Henderson came out of retirement in 2012 to narrate a documentary for the Foxtel network, &quot;The Train: The Granville Rail Disaster&quot;, which examined the aftermath of the 1977 rail disaster and the rescue workers&#x27; heroism.

==Recognition==
===National honours===
In the 2009 Australia Day Honours, Henderson was named a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for &quot;service as a pioneer in the television news and entertainment sectors, and as a mentor to aspiring and established presenters, readers and journalists&quot;.
===Awards=== 

Henderson won his first TV Week Gold Logie award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television in 1968. He received a second Gold Logie at the Logie Awards in April 2013 when he was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame. Industry peers vote for the award and he was the 30th inductee since the award began in 1983. Henderson was on the shortlist in 2010 when it was awarded, posthumously, to Brian Naylor.

The King of Pop Awards were voted by the readers of &quot;TV Week&quot;. The award started in 1967 and ended in 1978. Henderson won the award for his Contribution to Teenage Television in 1972.

Henderson won a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2019 Kennedy Awards.

==Personal life==
Henderson was married to Mardi Ozoux from 1966 until his death. Together, they had two children, Nicole and Jodie. He also had two children from his first marriage.

Henderson revealed he had throat cancer in 2014. He previously had other cancers; doctors said his prognosis was good. In February 2020, it was announced that Henderson had kidney cancer and that he had opted not to receive treatment.

==Death==
Henderson died on 5 August 2021 at his home in Sydney, at the age of 89. A private funeral was held on 16 August, in front of a limited number of family members including his 5 grandchildren (Jess, Jamie, Jade, Thomas and Charles) due to COVID-19 restrictions in place at the time.

<doc id="182368" wikidata="Q1571511" url="?curid=182368" title="MIDlet">
<text>A MIDlet is an application that uses the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) of the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) for the Java ME environment. Typical applications include games running on mobile devices such as smartphones with J2ME support and feature phones which have small graphical displays, simple numeric keypad interfaces and limited network access over HTTP.

The codice_1 file describing a MIDlet suite is used to deploy the applications in one of two ways. Over the air (OTA) deployment involves uploading the codice_1 and codice_3 files to a Web server which is accessible by the device over HTTP. The user downloads the codice_1 file and installs the MIDlets they require. Local deployment requires that the MIDlet files be transferred to the device over a non-network connection (such as through Bluetooth or IrDa, and may involve device-specific software). Phones that support microSD cards can sometimes install .jar or .jad files that have been transferred to the memory card.

== Platforms ==
Mainly MIDlet applications and games developed for Series 40, Series 60, Nokia Asha and Sony Ericsson Java Platform.

== Emulation ==
MIDlet can run using MicroEmulator app on any desktop PC with JavaSE and on Maemo. On Android devices via the J2ME Loader (MicroEmulator fork) application.

Other J2ME emulators also could be used with or without some limitations.

==Restrictions==
Unlike a Java applet, a MIDlet is limited to use of the LCDUI rather than the more familiar widgets of AWT and Swing. There are also restrictions on the size of codice_3 files and the number of concurrent HTTP connections based on the MIDP specification.

<doc id="182369" wikidata="Q2141748" url="?curid=182369" title="Whitelist">
<text>A whitelist or allowlist is a list or register of entities that are being provided a particular privilege, service, mobility, access or recognition. Entities on the list will be accepted, approved and/or recognized. Whitelisting is the reverse of blacklisting, the practice of identifying entities that are denied, unrecognized, or ostracized.

==Email whitelists==
Spam filters often include the ability to &quot;whitelist&quot; certain sender IP addresses, email addresses or domain names to protect their email from being rejected or sent to a junk mail folder. These can be manually maintained by the user or system administrator - but can also refer to externally maintained whitelist services.

===Non-commercial whitelists===
Non-commercial whitelists are operated by various non-profit organizations, ISPs, and others interested in blocking spam. Rather than paying fees, the sender must pass a series of tests; for example, their email server must not be an open relay and have a static IP address. The operator of the whitelist may remove a server from the list if complaints are received.

===Commercial whitelists===
Commercial whitelists are a system by which an Internet service provider allows someone to bypass spam filters when sending email messages to its subscribers, in return for a pre-paid fee, either an annual or a per-message fee. A sender can then be more confident that their messages have reached recipients without being blocked, or having links or images stripped out of them, by spam filters. The purpose of commercial whitelists is to allow companies to reliably reach their customers by email.

== Advertising whitelists ==
Many websites rely on ads as a source of revenue, but the use of ad blockers is increasingly common. Websites that detect an adblocker in use often ask for it to be disabled - or their site to be &quot;added to the whitelist&quot; - a standard feature of most adblockers.

==Network whitelists==
===LAN whitelists===
A use for whitelists is in local area network (LAN) security. Many network admins set up MAC address whitelists, or a MAC address filter, to control who is allowed on their networks. This is used when encryption is not a practical solution or in tandem with encryption. However, it&#x27;s sometimes ineffective because a MAC address can be faked.

===IP whitelist===
Firewalls can usually be configured to only allow data-traffic from/to certain (ranges of) IP-addresses.

===Application whitelists===
One approach in combating viruses and malware is to whitelist software which is considered safe to run, blocking all others. This is particularly attractive in a corporate environment, where there are typically already restrictions on what software is approved.

Leading providers of application whitelisting technology include Bit9, Velox, McAfee, Lumension, ThreatLocker, Airlock Digital and SMAC.

On Microsoft Windows, recent versions include AppLocker, which allows administrators to control which executable files are denied or allowed to execute. With AppLocker, administrators are able to create rules based on file names, publishers or file location that will allow certain files to execute. Rules can apply to individuals or groups. Policies are used to group users into different enforcement levels. For example, some users can be added to a report-only policy that will allow administrators to understand the impact before moving that user to a higher enforcement level.

Linux systems typically have AppArmor and SE Linux features available which can be used to effectively block all applications which are not explicitly whitelisted, and commercial products are also available.

On HP-UX introduced a feature called &quot;HP-UX Whitelisting&quot; on 11iv3 version.

<doc id="182376" wikidata="Q534708" url="?curid=182376" title="Henri Désiré Landru">
<text>Henri Désiré Landru (12 April 1869 – 25 February 1922) () was a French serial killer, nicknamed the [[Bluebeard]] of Gambais. He murdered at least seven women in the village of Gambais between December 1915 and January 1919. Landru also killed at least three other women and a young man in the house he rented from December 1914 to August 1915 in the town of Vernouillet, a town northwest of Paris. The true number of Landru&#x27;s victims is suspected to be higher.

Landru was arrested on 12 April 1919 at an apartment near Paris&#x27;s Gare du Nord, which he shared with his 24-year-old mistress Fernande Segret. The police eventually concluded that Landru had met or been in romantic correspondence with 283 women during the First World War. Seventy-two were never traced. In December 1919, Landru&#x27;s wife Marie-Catherine, 51, and his eldest son Maurice, 25, were arrested on suspicion of complicity in Landru&#x27;s thefts from his victims. Both denied any knowledge of Landru&#x27;s criminal activities. Marie-Catherine was released without charge in July 1920 for health reasons. Maurice was released on the same day because the authorities could not establish his guilt.

Landru continued to protest his innocence during the yearlong investigation. He was charged with the murders at Vernouillet and Gambais. This included the murders of ten women and his first victim&#x27;s teenage son. Landru&#x27;s trial in November 1921 at Versailles was attended by leading French celebrities, including the novelist Colette, and the actor and singer Maurice Chevalier. His attorney was Vincent de Moro-Giafferi, the lawyer who also defended Herschel Grynszpan. On 30 November, Landru was found guilty by a majority verdict of all eleven murders and sentenced to death. He was executed by guillotine on 25 February 1922.

== Early life==

Henri Landru was born in Paris, the son of a furnace stoker and a laundress, who were both ardent Catholics. He was educated by monks at a Catholic school on the Île Saint-Louis, serving as an altar boy at the adjacent church, where his parents and elder sister worshipped. By his late teens, Landru had graduated to sub-deacon, a secular post that involved lighting candles and helping a priest with his vestments. According to his future wife Marie-Catherine, she first set eyes on the young Landru at Mass one Sunday in 1887. &quot;We got talking as we were leaving the church and so my love story began.&quot;

Landru and Marie-Catherine&#x27;s first child, Marie, was born illegitimately in 1891, shortly after Landru began three years&#x27; obligatory military service in the northern French town of Saint-Quentin, rising from private to the position of deputy quartermaster. In the autumn of 1893, he returned to Paris and married Marie-Catherine, who was already pregnant with their second child, Maurice. The couple had two more children: Suzanne, born in 1896, and Charles, born in 1900.

During the 1890s while his wife worked as a laundress, Landru drifted from one job to the next. He was employed for short periods in Paris as a plumber&#x27;s accountant, a furniture salesman and an assistant to a toy maker. In a later newspaper interview, Marie-Catherine described Landru as a &quot;model husband&quot; and father in the early years of their marriage, even though she also told police that he was a &quot;skirt chaser&quot; from the very beginning.

==Crime==
Landru&#x27;s drift into crime and possible insanity seems to have been associated with his ambition to become a famous inventor. In 1898 he designed a primitive motorbike, which he called &quot;The Landru&quot;, and then deceived several potential investors into giving him money to build a factory to manufacture it. Having pocketed the money, Landru vanished. Other projects that Landru began in the late 1890s and early 1900s included a plan for a new suburban railway line west of Paris and an automated toy for children. Meanwhile, he was constantly on the run from the police, seeing little of his family and lying low for a year in Le Havre.

In 1904 Landru was finally arrested in Paris after falling in the street, as he was running away from a bank he had tried to defraud. He was remanded in custody at the Santé prison where he made what appears to have been a fake suicide attempt, slipping his head through a noose made from his bed sheet just as a guard was entering his cell. Landru was examined by Dr. Charles Vallon, one of France&#x27;s leading criminal psychiatrists, who concluded that Landru was &quot;on the frontiers of madness&quot; but was not yet insane and was still responsible for his actions. Vallon&#x27;s diagnosis was confirmed by two other psychiatrists. Yet Vallon was sufficiently concerned by Landru&#x27;s behaviour that he warned Marie-Catherine to be on guard in the future.

Landru was tried and sentenced to two years in jail in the town of Fresnes, south of Paris. He was in and out of prison for the next decade. During this period, Landru&#x27;s wife and four children lived in a series of cheap rented apartments in and around Paris. In 1909 Landru attempted to swindle an affluent widow in the northern city of Lille by posing as a wealthy, single businessman and persuading her to hand over her savings in a pre-marital contract. He was arrested while trying to cash in her investment certificates and sentenced to three years in prison at Loos, near Lille. While he was in jail, his widowed father committed suicide in April 1912 by hanging himself from a tree in the Bois de Boulogne. Landru&#x27;s wife subsequently claimed that her father-in-law had killed himself partly in despair at her husband&#x27;s criminal career. She also said that in the autumn of 1912, as soon as he was released from prison, Landru stole around 12,000 francs (approximately $40,000 in modern money) that his father had pointedly left for her and the four children, rather than him.

In the winter of 1913–14, Landru executed easily the most successful swindle of his career, duping more than a dozen individuals into giving him a total of 35,600 francs to &quot;invest&quot; in building a fictitious automobile factory. He went on the run in April 1914 with all this money, plus most of his father&#x27;s inheritance, just before the police came to arrest him. In late July 1914, he was tried and convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; for the fraud. Taking his previous convictions into account, the court sentenced Landru to four years of hard labour followed by exile for life on the French Pacific island of New Caledonia.

== Murders (1915–1919) ==
=== Jeanne and André Cuchet (January or February 1915) ===
Landru had escaped to a village near the town of Chantilly, north of Paris, in the company of Jeanne Cuchet, a pretty, 39-year-old Parisian seamstress who had been widowed in 1909. She knew him at this stage as &quot;Raymond Diard&quot;, an industrialist from northern France, who had promised to marry her and had persuaded her to give up her job making lingerie for a dress shop in Paris. Cuchet appears to have hoped that Landru, alias Diard, would provide a respectable home for her and her only son André, 17, who was illegitimate.

The balance of Cuchet&#x27;s relationship with Landru changed completely in early August 1914 when Germany declared war on France. Landru failed to make a rendezvous with Cuchet, who had returned to Paris to be with André, still living in her old apartment. In despair, Cuchet went back to the house near Chantilly, accompanied by André and her brother-in-law, hoping to find the man she still knew as &quot;Diard&quot;. The house was empty, but she found Landru&#x27;s identity papers inside a chest, along with various fake documents. The next day, Cuchet visited Landru&#x27;s abandoned apartment in southern Paris where she discovered that he was a criminal on the run who should have been deported to New Caledonia.

Cuchet insisted to her sister and brother-in-law that her engagement with Landru was over, but when he reappeared in late August 1914 she resumed their relationship. Meanwhile, she kept a close watch on her patriotic son André, who was desperate to join the army and fight the Germans, even though he was too young to volunteer. In late November 1914, Cuchet suddenly pulled André out of his job at an automobile factory in northwest Paris. At the start of December, Cuchet, Landru (posing as &quot;Monsieur Cuchet&quot;) and André moved to a house in Vernouillet, a small town by the Seine, 35 km northwest of Paris. Over Christmas, Cuchet wrote to a woman friend in Paris, explaining that it would not be convenient to visit her in Vernouillet because of the poor weather: &quot;at the moment the place is rather muddy&quot;. In mid-January, André learned to his joy that his scheduled recruitment to the army had been brought forward two years to the summer of 1915. He wrote to a friend in the army on 20 January, reporting his good news, and another to an uncle a week later. Then Cuchet and André disappeared without a trace. No one ever saw them again.

=== Subsequent murders (June 1915 – January 1919) ===
Landru&#x27;s subsequent murders between 1915 and 1919 were presented chronologically at his trial, creating the false impression that he had met the women in the order in which he killed them. In fact, one of his known victims had been &quot;engaged&quot; to the married Landru for more than two years before he murdered her, a period during which he killed at least five other women; another victim had known him for more than a year and a half before she disappeared; while his last known victim, a prostitute, may have first encountered Landru as early as 1914.

It was also taken for granted by the police and the prosecution that he had recorded the total number of his victims in a list of 11 names and code names he had written at the back of a little black notebook (known in French as a &quot;carnet&quot;) which was discovered immediately after his arrest. This is questionable for several reasons. Landru did not acquire the &quot;carnet&quot; until the spring of 1915, more than a year after he first met Jeanne Cuchet, his first known victim. He did not begin to keep detailed notes in the &quot;carnet&quot; until the summer of 1916, and even then, statements by various witnesses proved beyond doubt that Landru did not record all his planned and impromptu encounters with women in the later years of the war. Landru claimed at his trial that the list was simply an &quot;aide-mémoire&quot; to remind him of clients from whom he had bought furniture as a second-hand dealer. He was certainly lying, but based on witness testimony and forensic evidence, it is also almost certain that other unknown victims were not recorded by Landru on the list.

Landru&#x27;s nine known victims after Jeanne and André Cuchet all lived in Paris. In order of the presumed date of their murder, they were:

==== Thérèse Laborde-Line, 46 (Vernouillet, June 1915) ====

Born in Argentina, Thérèse Laborde-Line was a divorced, unemployed widow who was estranged from her only son, a postal clerk, and her daughter-in-law. She met Landru either through a lonely-hearts advertisement he placed on 1 May 1915 in &quot;Le Journal&quot;, a mass-circulation daily, or through a notice applying for a position as a lady&#x27;s companion which she placed in another newspaper.

==== Marie-Angélique Guillin, 52 (Vernouillet, August 1915) ====
She was a widowed, retired housekeeper, living near Paris&#x27;s Gare de Lyon, who had inherited a substantial sum from her last employer. Guillin answered Landru&#x27;s 1 May 1915 lonely-hearts advertisement and believed his story about being the next Consul-General to Australia, in need of a wife to host diplomatic receptions.

==== Berthe Héon, 55 (Gambais, December 1915) ====
Originally from Le Havre, Berthe Héon scraped a living as a cleaning woman and had suffered multiple bereavements, losing in turn her husband, her long-term lover, her two legitimate children and her beloved illegitimate daughter in childbirth. She met Landru in the summer of 1915, probably via a second lonely-hearts advertisement he placed in &quot;Le Journal&quot;. Posing as a businessman, Landru pretended he was in search of a wife to join him in the &quot;pretty colony&quot; of Tunisia.

==== Anna Collomb, 44 (Gambais, December 1916) ====
Anna Collomb was a clever, attractive widow who worked as a typist at an insurance company in Paris and had had a string of lovers since the death of her alcoholic, bankrupt husband a decade earlier. Her motive for answering Landru&#x27;s 1 May 1915 lonely-hearts advertisement was probably that she wanted a stepfather for her illegitimate young daughter, whom she had reportedly placed in the care of nuns in Italy. The little girl was never traced by the police.

==== Andrée Babelay, 19 (Gambais, April 1917) ====
Chatty and vivacious, Andrée Babelay was a nanny and possibly a casual prostitute whom Landru picked up one evening while riding on the Paris metro. Babelay spent the next ten days living with Landru (whom she called &#x27;Lulu&#x27;) in a room he rented near Paris&#x27;s Gare du Nord, and then a further fortnight at his rented house near Gambais, where she was seen by a local game warden learning to ride a bicycle.

==== Célestine Buisson, 47 (Gambais, September 1917) ====
Homely, trusting and semi-literate, Célestine Buisson was yet another woman who answered Landru&#x27;s 1 May 1915 lonely-hearts advertisement in &quot;Le Journal.&quot; Born in southwest France, Buisson was a widow who worked as a housekeeper and was lonely after the mobilization of her only son, who was illegitimate. Landru, alias Georges Frémyet, became &quot;engaged&quot; to Buisson immediately, but then put off their marriage for more than two years, pleading lost identity documents and long &quot;business trips&quot; abroad.

==== Louise Jaume, 38 (Gambais, November 1917) ====
She was a devout Catholic, working as a dress shop assistant, who answered a lonely-hearts advertisement Landru placed in a conservative newspaper after deciding to divorce her estranged husband. Jaume initially refused to sleep with Landru, alias &quot;Lucien Guillet&quot;, a refugee from the German-occupied Ardennes region. He broke her resistance and then took her to Gambais on a one-way train ticket after celebrating Mass with her at the basilica of Sacré Cœur in Paris.

==== Anne-Marie (&#x27;Annette&#x27;) Pascal, 37 (Gambais, April 1918) ====
On account of her wide-brimmed hats, Annette Pascal was nicknamed &quot;Mme Sombrero&quot; by her neighbours on the street near the Père Lachaise cemetery where she lived and worked, making dresses for a Paris fashion house. Pascal was divorced and childless, following the death of her only son in infancy, and was looking for a so-called &quot;vieux monsieur&quot; (&quot;sugar daddy&quot;) in September 1916 when she spotted Landru&#x27;s lonely-hearts advertisement in the Paris evening daily, &quot;La Presse.&quot;

==== Marie-Thérèse Marchadier, 37 (Gambais, January 1919) ====
Born in Bordeaux, Marie-Thérèse Marchadier was a career prostitute and a familiar sight on the street outside her apartment on Paris&#x27;s Rue Saint-Jacques, where she liked to walk her two beloved Belgian griffon dogs. At Landru&#x27;s trial, the prosecution claimed that he first met the heavily indebted Marchadier in October 1918 after she advertised to sell her furniture. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he may have encountered her several years earlier in the port of Le Havre or the provincial town of Beauvais.

=== Pursuit and arrest ===
Landru was able to avoid capture during the war for three main reasons. One was the war itself, which denuded France&#x27;s civilian police force, as officers of military age were mobilized and sent to the front. In Vernouillet, where Landru rented his first house from December 1914 to August 1915, there was just one constable for the whole town. In Gambais, where Landru rented his second house from December 1915 until his arrest, there was one constable in his early seventies, stationed in the village, and a single mounted gendarme in the market town of Houdan, four miles (6.4 km) away.

Secondly, Landru&#x27;s wife and four children knew his whereabouts throughout the war but shielded him from the police. Landru&#x27;s youngest son Charles, born in 1900, worked as his self-styled &quot;apprentice&quot;, helping Landru remove furniture and other possessions from at least five of his known victims&#x27; apartments and latterly acting as his father&#x27;s chauffeur. His eldest son Maurice, born in 1894, was mobilized in the summer of 1915 and arrested soon afterwards for various frauds and thefts, including the receipt and sale of valuables from Landru that had belonged to his first known victim, Jeanne Cuchet. Following his release from prison, Maurice helped Landru concoct a cover story to explain the disappearance of his sixth known victim, Anna Collomb, to one of Anna&#x27;s friends. Meanwhile, Landru&#x27;s wife lived for most of the war in the northwestern Paris suburb of Clichy under the false name &quot;Frémyet&quot; (one of Landru&#x27;s aliases) in an apartment where he was seen coming and going at regular intervals. Landru&#x27;s wife forged the signature of his eighth known victim, Célestine Buisson, so he could gain access to Célestine&#x27;s bank account, and impersonated his ninth known victim, Louise Jaume, for the same purpose.

Lastly, Landru benefited from the indifference of police officers and village officials to the fate of the women, at a time when hundreds of thousands of young men were losing their lives at the front. Indeed, it is arguable that Landru might never have been arrested without the persistence of another woman who forced the authorities to investigate the suspicious man who rented the Villa Tric outside Gambais: Marie Lacoste.

==== Marie Lacoste&#x27;s pursuit of Landru ====
Marie Lacoste, the younger half-sister of Célestine Buisson, was an unmarried housemaid who disliked Landru, alias George Frémyet, from the moment she first met him at Buisson&#x27;s apartment in the summer of 1915. Over the next two years, Lacoste began to suspect that Buisson&#x27;s fiancé was a marriage swindler, out to get his hands on the naive Buisson&#x27;s savings. Lacoste&#x27;s suspicion was confirmed during a visit with Buisson to the Villa Tric in August 1917, when Buisson admitted that &quot;Frémyet&quot; had taken charge of her investments. Buisson refused to take Lacoste&#x27;s advice to end her engagement to &quot;Frémyet&quot; and the two sisters were scarcely on speaking terms when they returned to Paris. A day later, Landru took Buisson back to Gambais, travelling on a one-way train ticket. She was never seen again.

During the autumn of 1917, Landru became increasingly worried that Lacoste might suspect him of Buisson&#x27;s murder. He tried to reassure Lacoste that her half-sister was still alive by sending her two fake postcards from Gambais, purportedly signed by &quot;Célestine&quot;. Lacoste instantly realized the signatures were forgeries, but having concluded that Landru was just a con man, did not take any other action. Still worried, Landru turned up alone on several occasions at Lacoste&#x27;s workplace to invite her to dinner with Buisson at Buisson&#x27;s apartment in Paris. Landru knew the apartment was empty and almost certainly intended to kill Lacoste there. Each time, Lacoste refused, eventually telling Landru to get lost and not to come back.

For the next year, Lacoste mentally washed her hands of Buisson, deciding that her half-sister was too ashamed about falling into the clutches of a crook to want any further contact between them. Then in December 1918, Lacoste received a letter which stirred her into action. Buisson&#x27;s son had been blinded during the war and from his home in southwest France, had tried to contact Buisson to borrow money, following what he called a &quot;serious accident&quot;. She had not replied, prompting the son to ask Lacoste if she could intervene with Buisson on his behalf. Lacoste visited Buisson&#x27;s old apartment, where the concierge told her that Buisson had last been seen there in the summer of 1917 and that at least one other woman had subsequently spent the night at the address with &quot;Frémyet&quot; before he paid off the lease. Thoroughly alarmed, Lacoste concluded that Landru had probably killed Buisson and had been planning to kill her when he invited her to the apartment.

She rapidly compiled a dossier for the police, noting Landru&#x27;s physical appearance, his known movements with Buisson since 1915, the location and design of his house near Gambais, his thefts from Buisson&#x27;s bank accounts, the forged postcards after her disappearance and his phony invitations to dinner. On 11 January 1919, Lacoste took her dossier to her local police station in Paris, accompanied by a fellow maid called Laure Bonhoure who had seen Landru when he had visited the house where they worked. At the station, a police officer told Lacoste that she needed to contact the authorities in Gambais, where Buisson had vanished. The next day, Lacoste wrote to the mayor of Gambais in her best formal French, forgetting her full stops as she raced on:

&quot;You have in your commune a house at about 100 meters from the church, which is called the Maison Tric, the name of the owner, I do not know him, but the house was rented in 1917, to a gentleman around 40 years old, who had a long brown beard and who has as his name Monsieur Frémyet. Therefore this gentleman lived in this house for a good part of the summer of 1917 with a woman of about 45 to 50, or more exactly 47, with blue eyes and chestnut hair, medium height.&quot;

The mayor denied any knowledge of Célestine Buisson or a man called Frémyet living at the Maison (or Villa) Tric. This claim was well short of the truth because the mayor recognized the man described accurately by Lacoste as another of Landru&#x27;s aliases: &quot;Raoul Dupont&quot;. The mayor did, however, put Lacoste in touch with Victorine Pellat, the younger sister of Landru&#x27;s sixth known victim Anna Collomb, who had made an identical inquiry about Collomb in 1917.

Lacoste contacted Pellat and after conferring about their separate investigations, they filed two missing person complaints with the prosecutor&#x27;s office in the department of Seine-et-Oise, where Gambais was located. By a desultory route, the cases finally wound their way back to Inspector Jules Belin of the Paris flying squad (&quot;brigade mobile&quot;).

Belin interviewed Pellat and Lacoste and then plagiarized most of the latter&#x27;s research for an internal police report in which he falsely took the credit for Landru&#x27;s arrest. In reality, Landru&#x27;s capture was entirely due to a chance sighting of him on 11 April 1919 by Lacoste&#x27;s friend Laure Bonhoure as he was shopping with his mistress Fernande Segret in a crockery shop on Rue de Rivoli. Bonhoure tried to follow Landru after he left the shop, but fearing he had recognized her, she ran home to tell Lacoste, who phoned Belin with the news. Belin retrieved the business card that Landru, alias &quot;Lucien Guillet&quot;, had given to a shop assistant and visited the address indicated: 76 Rue de Rochechouart, near the Gare du Nord. However, Belin only had an arrest warrant for a man called &quot;Frémyet&quot;, so decided to go home for the night.

On 12 April, at around midday, Belin returned with two fellow officers and a newly drafted warrant and arrested Landru, who had just returned from accosting a woman on the metro.

== Investigation (April 1919 – November 1921) ==

From the moment of his arrest, when he refused to confirm his identity, Landru was a formidably obdurate suspect. During multiple interrogations in 1919 and 1920, he repeatedly protested his innocence, demanding to know why he would have killed the women when they were his &quot;friends&quot;.

The investigating magistrate Gabriel Bonin was initially confident that he could wrap up the case in a matter of days, following the discovery on 29 April 1919 of some tiny fragments of charred human bone debris beneath a pile of leaves in Landru&#x27;s back garden at Gambais. However, this material was more problematic than it first appeared. Gradually, Bonin&#x27;s inquiry was enmeshed in a series of interlocking, seemingly insoluble puzzles.

===Evidence of murder===
In the weeks after Landru&#x27;s arrest, the police gathered overwhelming proof that Landru had stolen the financial assets and possessions of the 10 missing women on the list in his &quot;carnet&quot;. Landru had kept the stolen items he had not sold at a garage in Clichy and various storage depots around Paris, along with files on dozens of women he had contacted during the war via lonely hearts advertisements and matrimonial agencies.

What the police lacked was direct evidence of murder, apart from the charred bone debris discovered at Gambais; and under the microscope, these fragments turned out to be &quot;a veritable puzzle&quot;, according to Dr Charles Paul, the director of the Paris police laboratory. Paul and his colleagues were only able to establish that the debris had come from three or more skeletons. They did not know if the skeletons were female, because there were no pelvic bones; nor could the forensic scientists confirm that the fragments came from three or more of the women who were known to have vanished at Gambais.

Although Paul avoided speculation in his report on the debris, it was possible that the fragments came from the burnt skeletons of other unknown victims whom Landru had killed at the Villa Tric. This possibility was reinforced by the evidence of one witness in particular, an army doctor who had seen Landru dumping a heavy package in a pond near Gambais in the late spring or early summer of 1916. The doctor did not testify at Landru&#x27;s trial, pleading illness, but the prosecution acknowledged that his sighting did not fit the timeline of the known disappearances; about six months after the presumed murder of Landru&#x27;s fifth known fiancée and six months before the death of the next victim on the charge sheet.

===Complicity of Landru&#x27;s family===
To varying degrees, Landru&#x27;s wife and four children were all complicit in shielding him from the police during the war and in abetting his thefts from the missing women. The unanswered question is whether any, some or all of them were also complicit in his murders.

His youngest son Charles, acted as his self-styled &quot;apprentice&quot; from 1914 to 1919, helping Landru to clear five of the women&#x27;s apartments after they vanished. Two days after Landru&#x27;s arrest, Charles also admitted assisting his father with unexplained &quot;gardening work&quot; at Landru&#x27;s house in Vernouillet in early 1915, around the time that Jeanne and André Cuchet disappeared.

Landru&#x27;s eldest son Maurice (born in 1894) was arrested for swindling and thefts in the autumn of 1915, shortly after his mobilization, and tried by court-martial. Among the valuables in Maurice&#x27;s possession was jewellery belonging to Jeanne Cuchet which Landru had given him. Maurice later disclaimed any knowledge of the jewellery&#x27;s provenance. In January 1917, following his release from a military prison, Maurice assisted his father in creating a cover story to explain the disappearance of the sixth missing woman, Anna Collomb.

Landru&#x27;s wife Marie Catherine forged at least one of the missing women&#x27;s signatures so Landru could gain access to his victim&#x27;s bank savings. Under interrogation, Marie Catherine initially protested her innocence, claiming her only crime had been &quot;to love my husband too much&quot;. She eventually confessed, while insisting that she had had no idea why Landru had asked her to commit the forgery.

The complicity of Landru&#x27;s two daughters, Marie (born 1891) and Suzanne (born 1896), was less certain. Marie disclaimed any knowledge of his activities during the war, even though in August 1917 she had bid unsuccessfully at a property auction in Gambais on Landru&#x27;s behalf for a house in which he was interested. Suzanne moved out of the family&#x27;s apartment in 1916 when she became engaged, but still saw Landru at intervals on her visits back home.

In December 1919 the investigating magistrate Bonin ordered the arrest of Landru&#x27;s wife and Maurice Landru on suspicion of complicity in Landru&#x27;s thefts and frauds. However, Bonin never formally charged them and in July 1920 they were released from custody – in Marie-Catherine&#x27;s case on medical grounds (she had a bad back) and in Maurice&#x27;s case because according to Bonin, his continuing detention was not helpful to the investigation. It appears more likely that Bonin decided a jury would struggle to believe that Marie-Catherine and Maurice had known nothing about the murders, given their clear involvement in Landru&#x27;s thefts. This is also the most plausible explanation for why Bonin never arrested Landru&#x27;s youngest son and &quot;apprentice&quot; Charles.

== Trial (7 – 30 November 1921) ==
Landru was eventually brought to trial in Versailles in November 1921, after exhausting his appeals against previous convictions. The location was a compromise between the authorities in the department of Seine-et-Oise (now Yvelines), where Landru had allegedly committed the murders, and the judiciary in Paris, where his victims had lived. Versailles was chosen as the venue as the largest town in Seine-et-Oise, while the presiding judge, Maurice Gilbert, was from the Paris judiciary. 

Gilbert allowed photographers to take pictures during each session, a decision which helped to stoke the sensational atmosphere surrounding the long-awaited trial of the &quot;Bluebeard of Gambais&quot;. Every day, the newspapers gave saturation coverage of the proceedings and as the trial progressed, and the possibility of Landru&#x27;s acquittal on the murder charges seemed to increase. 

The proceedings attracted trainloads of spectators from Paris. Celebrities who came to watch Landru included the reigning queen of French musical theatre, Mistinguett, the actors Maurice Chevalier and Sacha Guitry, the writer Rudyard Kipling (in Paris to receive an honorary degree) and the novelist Colette (who covered the first session for the newspaper &quot;Le Matin)&quot;. By the end of the trial, Gilbert had lost all control of the audience, with as many as 500 spectators crammed inside, double the courtroom&#x27;s capacity.

===The defence and prosecution cases===
Landru&#x27;s 43-year-old defence attorney Vincent de Moro Giafferri, widely regarded as the most famous trial lawyer in France, privately despised his client and thought he was insane. However, Moro was also a passionate opponent of the death penalty and did not believe that the prosecution could remotely prove that Landru had certainly killed the 10 women and one young man on the murder charge sheet. Moro therefore proposed to offer the jury a bargain. The defence would not contest the multiple charges of theft and fraud (even though Landru denied them), which would be enough to send Landru for the rest of his life into exile with hard labour in French Guiana – an ordeal which would probably kill him before long, given Landru&#x27;s poor physical health.

In constructing this defence, Moro&#x27;s chief difficulty was keeping Landru under control and preferably silent. Under examination, Landru repeatedly made clear that he knew more about the fate of the women than he was prepared to reveal, ostensibly because he had had a &quot;sacred compact&quot; with them which swore him to silence. Adding to the impression of his guilt, Landru argued ludicrously that he had pursued the women via lonely hearts advertisements as a means to gain access to their furniture, which he had wanted to sell. He denied that any of them had been his mistresses and insisted that the incriminating list of names in his notebook was merely a record of his clients.

Moro&#x27;s best chance of saving Landru from the guillotine lay in the overall weakness of the murder case. As Moro argued, none of the 157 witnesses on the prosecution&#x27;s list (about 120 of whom were called) had any direct evidence of murder. All the mothers, sisters and female friends of the missing women could produce was proof of Landru&#x27;s trickery of their loved ones, which the defence did not dispute. Moro ridiculed the incompetence of the police, who had failed to seal Landru&#x27;s property at Gambais after their first search of the house and gardens when they had not discovered the bone debris. In Moro&#x27;s view, it was possible that the debris had been planted by persons unknown before the second search, in order to incriminate Landru.

The chief prosecuting attorney Robert Godefroy, a plodding government barrister, struggled from the start of the trial to make any headway with Landru or prevent Moro from undermining the credibility of the police and forensic witnesses. Gilbert, the judge, effectively took over the examination of Landru, as he was entitled to do under the French judicial system. Yet while Gilbert scored some palpable hits against Landru – in particular, regarding the records in his notebook – the consensus among reporters covering the trial was that the outcome would depend on the closing speeches by Godefroy and Moro.

Godefroy was suffering from flu, forcing him to break off his marathon address on the first day and complete it the following afternoon. He itemized eight &quot;proofs&quot; which in his view demonstrated Landru&#x27;s guilt beyond all doubt, from the one-way train tickets Landru had bought the women on their last known journey to Gambais to the killer&#x27;s tell-tale noting of the hour they disappeared – &quot;the hour of the execution&quot;.

In a brilliant &quot;tour de force&quot;, Moro set about demolishing every shred of supposed certainty in the case. Yet even Moro could not explain away the sinister fact that none of the women had surfaced following Landru&#x27;s arrest. Instead, Moro fell back on a lurid scenario where Landru had been a pimp who had dispatched the women abroad into the &quot;white slave trade&quot;. To support his argument, Moro claimed that all the women had been in some sense estranged from their families, an allegation that was demonstrably untrue in several cases, and arguable in several others.

Moro also tried to demonstrate that there was no certainty that the women were actually dead. During his pleading, he affirmed that victims had been found and were going to come and appear before the court. The public and the jurors turned their heads towards the door that Moro had then designated, and after letting the suspense hang, he underlined the fact that all those who had turned their heads towards the exit had thus demonstrated their lack of certainty concerning the reality of the assassinations attributed to his client, highlighting the absence of formal evidence against Landru, since no corpse had been found. The attorney general retorted straight away that Landru had not turned his head towards the door.

===The verdict===
The jury&#x27;s verdict, delivered on the evening of 30 November 1921 after three hours deliberation, was not straightforward. By a majority of nine to three, they found Landru guilty of all 11 murders on the charge sheet. Separately, the jury unanimously convicted Landru of all the counts of theft and fraud, apart from those concerning a teenage girl who had been destitute.
In the mayhem that followed the verdict, Moro instantly added to the confusion by persuading all twelve jurors to sign Landru&#x27;s pre-drafted appeal for clemency. If the appeal was successful, the sentence would be commuted to transportation with hard labour. However, Landru refused to sign the document on the grounds that he was entirely innocent. &quot;The tribunal has made a mistake&quot;, he told the court before being led back to his cell. &quot;I have never killed anyone. This is my final protest.&quot;

== Execution and aftermath ==

Landru was eventually persuaded by Moro to sign his clemency appeal, which was rejected by President Alexandre Millerand. Just before his execution, his final request was for a foot bath. He was executed by guillotine shortly before dawn on February 25, 1922, outside the gates of the Prison Saint-Pierre in Versailles. The whole procedure—from Landru walking out of prison to his beheading—took approximately 20 seconds. Landru&#x27;s corpse was then buried in a marked grave in the nearby Cimetière des Gonards. Five years later, his remains were disinterred and reburied in an unmarked grave in the same cemetery when his family declined to renew the lease on the burial site.

In the 1930s, Landru&#x27;s house at Gambais was converted into a restaurant which traded on his notoriety. The house still stands and in 2017 was put up for sale. Landru&#x27;s notorious oven, in which he allegedly burnt the remains of his victims, was sold at auction in 1923 to a businessman who wanted to put it on display in the Italian city of Turin, beyond French jurisdiction. The Turin authorities banned the exhibition and the oven disappeared from public view, possibly acquired by another private collector.

In 1968, a sketch of the oven that Landru had drawn during the trial and entrusted to Moro&#x27;s deputy counsel was produced by the lawyer&#x27;s daughter. Beside the oven, Landru had written: &quot;One can burn anything one wants in there&quot;, a remark attributed to him by a woman who had survived a visit to the house. On the back of the sketch, Landru had written: &quot;This demonstrates the stupidity of the witnesses. Nothing happened in front of the wall but in the house.&quot; The meaning of Landru&#x27;s statement is unclear.

A human skull claimed to be Landru&#x27;s is on display at the Museum of Death in Hollywood, California.

==In fiction==

The two most famous films that are based on Landru bear little relation to the original case. In 1947, Charlie Chaplin played the title role in &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot;, a black comedy about a bank clerk who loses his job and murders 14 affluent women to support his family. Chaplin adapted an original script by Orson Welles about Landru, which Chaplin then bought.

H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s short story &quot;The Horror in the Museum&quot; mentions a waxen figure of Landru. 

Claude Chabrol&#x27;s French-language &quot;Landru&quot; (1963), from a script by the novelist Françoise Sagan, ignored the first four murders at Vernouillet and recast the remaining women as fashionable and attractive. Chabrol was sued for defamation by Landru&#x27;s last mistress Fernande Segret, who disapproved of her portrayal in the film by the actress Stéphane Audran. Segret received modest damages and retired to a care home in the town of Flers, where she committed suicide in 1968.

In 1963, in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The New Exhibit&quot;, Landru is depicted as a wax figure who commits murder. He is portrayed by the American actor Milton Parsons.

<text>The sodium–potassium pump (sodium–potassium adenosine triphosphatase, also known as -ATPase, pump, or sodium–potassium ATPase) is an enzyme (an electrogenic transmembrane ATPase) found in the membrane of all animal cells. It performs several functions in cell physiology.

The -ATPase enzyme is active (i.e. it uses energy from ATP). For every ATP molecule that the pump uses, three sodium ions are exported and two potassium ions are imported. Thus, there is a net export of a single positive charge per pump cycle. The net effect is an extracellular concentration of sodium ions which is 5 times the intracellular concentration, and an intracellular concentration of potassium ions which is 30 times the extracellular concentration.

The sodium–potassium pump was discovered in 1957 by the Danish scientist Jens Christian Skou, who was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work in 1997. Its discovery marked an important step forward in the understanding of how ions get into and out of cells, and it has particular significance for excitable cells such as nerve cells, which depend on this pump to respond to stimuli and transmit impulses.

All mammals have four different sodium pump sub-types, or isoforms. Each has unique properties and tissue expression patterns. This enzyme belongs to the family of P-type ATPases.

== Function ==
The -ATPase helps maintain resting potential, affects transport, and regulates cellular volume. It also functions as a signal transducer/integrator to regulate the MAPK pathway, reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as intracellular calcium. In fact, all cells expend a large fraction of the ATP they produce (typically 30% and up to 70% in
nerve cells) to maintain their required cytosolic Na and K
concentrations.
For neurons, the -ATPase can be responsible for up to 3/4 of the cell&#x27;s energy expenditure. In many types of tissue, ATP consumption by the -ATPases have been related to glycolysis. This was first discovered in red blood cells (Schrier, 1966), but has later been evidenced in renal cells, smooth muscles surrounding the blood vessels, and cardiac Purkinje cells. Recently, glycolysis has also been shown to be of particular importance for -ATPase in skeletal muscles, where inhibition of glycogen breakdown (a substrate for glycolysis) leads to reduced -ATPase activity and lower force production.

=== Resting potential ===
In order to maintain the cell membrane potential, cells keep a low concentration of sodium ions and high levels of potassium ions within the cell (intracellular). The sodium–potassium pump mechanism moves 3 sodium ions out and moves 2 potassium ions in, thus, in total, removing one positive charge carrier from the intracellular space (see for details). In addition, there is a short-circuit channel (i.e. a highly K-permeable ion channel) for potassium in the membrane, thus the voltage across the plasma membrane is close to the Nernst potential of potassium.

=== Reversal potential ===
Even if both and ions have the same charge, they can still have very different equilibrium potentials for both outside and/or inside concentrations. The sodium-potassium pump moves toward a nonequilibrium state with the relative concentrations of and for both inside and outside of cell. For instance, the concentration of in cytosol is 100 mM, whereas the concentration of is 10 mM. On the other hand, in extracellular space, the usual concentration range of is about 3.5-5 mM, whereas the concentration of is about 135-145 mM.

=== Transport ===
Export of sodium ions from the cell provides the driving force for several secondary active transporters such as membrane transport proteins, which import glucose, amino acids and other nutrients into the cell by use of the sodium ion gradient.

Another important task of the - pump is to provide a gradient that is used by certain carrier processes. In the gut, for example, sodium is transported out of the reabsorbing cell on the blood (interstitial fluid) side via the - pump, whereas, on the reabsorbing (lumenal) side, the -glucose symporter uses the created gradient as a source of energy to import both and glucose, which is far more efficient than simple diffusion. Similar processes are located in the renal tubular system.

=== Controlling cell volume ===

Failure of the - pumps can result in swelling of the cell. A cell&#x27;s osmolarity is the sum of the concentrations of the various ion species and many proteins and other organic compounds inside the cell. When this is higher than the osmolarity outside of the cell, water flows into the cell through osmosis. This can cause the cell to swell up and lyse. The - pump helps to maintain the right concentrations of ions.
Furthermore, when the cell begins to swell, this automatically activates the - pump because it changes the internal concentrations of - to which the pump is sensitive.

=== Functioning as signal transducer ===
Within the last decade, many independent labs have demonstrated that, in addition to the classical ion transporting, this membrane protein can also relay extracellular ouabain-binding signalling into the cell through regulation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. For instance, a study investigated the function of -ATPase in foot muscle and hepatopancreas in land snail &quot;Otala lactea&quot; by comparing the active and estivating states. They concluded that reversible phosphorylation can control the same means of coordinating ATP use by this ion pump with the rates of the ATP generation by catabolic pathways in estivating &quot;O. lactea&quot;. The downstream signals through ouabain-triggered protein phosphorylation events include activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal cascades, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) in different intracellular compartments.

Protein-protein interactions play a very important role in - pump-mediated signal transduction. For example, the - pump interacts directly with Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, to form a signaling receptor complex. Src is initially inhibited by the - pump. However, upon subsequent ouabain binding, the Src kinase domain is released and then activated. Based on this scenario, NaKtide, a peptide Src inhibitor derived from the - pump, was developed as a functional ouabain–- pump-mediated signal transduction. - pump also interacts with ankyrin, IP3R, PI3K, PLCgamma1 and cofilin.

=== Controlling neuron activity states ===
The - pump has been shown to control and set the intrinsic activity mode of cerebellar Purkinje neurons, accessory olfactory bulb mitral cells and probably other neuron types. This suggests that the pump might not simply be a homeostatic, &quot;housekeeping&quot; molecule for ionic gradients, but could be a computation element in the cerebellum and the brain. Indeed, a mutation in the - pump causes rapid onset dystonia-parkinsonism, which has symptoms to indicate that it is a pathology of cerebellar computation. Furthermore, an ouabain block of - pumps in the cerebellum of a live mouse results in it displaying ataxia and dystonia. Alcohol inhibits sodium–potassium pumps in the cerebellum and this is likely how it corrupts cerebellar computation and body coordination. The distribution of the - pump on myelinated axons in the human brain has been demonstrated to be along the internodal axolemma, and not within the nodal axolemma as previously thought. The - pump disfunction has been tied to various diseases, including epilepsy and brain malformations.

== Mechanism ==

Looking at the process starting from the interior of the cell:
*The pump has a higher affinity for ions than ions, thus after binding ATP, binds 3 intracellular ions.
*ATP is hydrolyzed, leading to phosphorylation of the pump at a highly conserved aspartate residue and subsequent release of ADP. This process leads to a conformational change in the pump. 
*The conformational change exposes the ions to the extracellular region. The phosphorylated form of the pump has a low affinity for ions, so they are released; by contrast it has high affinity for the ions.
*The pump binds 2 extracellular ions, which induces dephosphorylation of the pump, reverting it to its previous conformational state, thus releasing the ions into the cell.
*The unphosphorylated form of the pump has a higher affinity for ions. ATP binds, and the process starts again.

== Regulation ==

=== Endogenous ===
The -ATPase is upregulated by cAMP. Thus, substances causing an increase in cAMP upregulate the -ATPase. These include the ligands of the Gs-coupled GPCRs. In contrast, substances causing a decrease in cAMP downregulate the -ATPase. These include the ligands of the Gi-coupled GPCRs. Note: Early studies indicated the &quot;opposite&quot; effect, but these were later found to be inaccurate due to additional complicating factors. 

The -ATPase is endogenously negatively regulated by the inositol pyrophosphate 5-InsP7, an intracellular signaling molecule generated by IP6K1, which relieves an autoinhibitory domain of PI3K p85α to drive endocytosis and degradation.

The -ATPase is also regulated by reversible phosphorylation. Research has shown that in estivating animals, the -ATPase is in the phosphorylated and low activity form. Dephosphorylation of -ATPase can recover it to the high activity form.

=== Exogenous ===
The -ATPase can be pharmacologically modified by administering drugs exogenously. Its expression can also be modified through hormones such as triiodothyronine, a thyroid hormone.

For instance, -ATPase found in the membrane of heart cells is an important target of cardiac glycosides (for example digoxin and ouabain), inotropic drugs used to improve heart performance by increasing its force of contraction.

Muscle contraction is dependent on a 100- to 10,000-times-higher-than-resting intracellular  concentration, which is caused by release from the muscle cells&#x27; sarcoplasmic reticulum. Immediately after muscle contraction, intracellular is quickly returned to its normal concentration by a carrier enzyme in the plasma membrane, and a calcium pump in sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing the muscle to relax.

According to the Blaustein-hypothesis, this carrier enzyme ( exchanger, NCX) uses the Na gradient generated by the - pump to remove from the intracellular space, hence slowing down the - pump results in a permanently elevated level in the muscle, which may be the mechanism of the long-term inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides such as digoxin. The problem with this hypothesis is that at pharmacological concentrations of digitalis, less than 5% of Na/K-ATPase molecules – specifically the α2 isoform in heart and arterial smooth muscle (&quot;K&quot;d = 32 nM) – are inhibited, not enough to affect the intracellular concentration of . However, apart from the population of Na/K-ATPase in the plasma membrane, responsible for ion transport, there is another population in the caveolae which acts as digitalis receptor and stimulates the EGF receptor.

=== Pharmacological regulation ===
In certain conditions such as in the case of cardiac disease, the -ATPase may need to be inhibited via pharmacological means. A commonly used inhibitor used in the treatment of cardiac disease is digoxin (a cardiac glycoside) which essentially binds &quot;to the extracellular part of enzyme i.e. that binds potassium, when it is in a phosphorylated state, to transfer potassium inside the cell&quot; After this essential binding occurs, a dephosphorylation of the alpha subunit occurs which reduces the effect of cardiac disease. It is via the inhibiting of the -ATPase that sodium levels will begin to increase within the cell which ultimately increases the concentration of intracellular calcium via the sodium-calcium exchanger. This increased presence of calcium is what allows for the force of contraction to be increased. In the case of patients where the heart is not pumping hard enough to provide what is needed for the body, use of digoxin helps to temporarily overcome this.

== Discovery ==
-ATPase was proposed by Jens Christian Skou in 1957 while working as assistant professor at the Department of Physiology, University of Aarhus, Denmark. He published his work that year.

In 1997, he received one-half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for the first discovery of an ion-transporting enzyme, -ATPase.&quot;

== Genes ==
* Alpha: ATP1A1, ATP1A2, ATP1A3, ATP1A4. ATP1A1 is expressed ubiquitously in vertebrates, and ATP1A3 in neural tissue. ATP1A2 is also known as &quot;alpha(+)&quot;. ATP1A4 is specific to mammals.
* Beta: ATP1B1, , ATP1B3

, although closely related to ATP1B1, ATP1B2, and ATP1B3, lost its function as -ATPase beta subunit.

== Parallel evolution of cardiotonic steroid resistance in vertebrates ==
Several studies have detailed the evolution of cardiotonic steroid resistance of the alpha-subunit gene family of Na/K-ATPase (ATP1A) in vertebrates via amino acid substitutions most often located in the first extracellular loop domain. Amino acid substitutions conferring cardiotonic steroid resistance have evolved independently many times in all major groups of tetrapods. ATP1A1 has been duplicated in some groups of frogs and neofunctionlised duplicates carry the same cardiotonic steroid resistance substitutions (Q111R and N122D) found in mice, rats and other muroids.

== In insects ==
In &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, the alpha-subunit of -ATPase has two paralogs, ATPα (ATPα1) and JYalpha (ATPα2), resulting from an ancient duplication in insects. In Drosophila, ATPα1 is ubiquitously and highly expressed, whereas ATPα2 is most highly expressed in male testes and is essential for male fertility. Insects have at least one copy of both genes, and occasionally duplications. Low expression of ATPα2 has also been noted in other insects. Duplications and neofunctionalization of ATPα1 have been observed in insects that are adapted to cardiotonic steroid toxins such as cardenolides and bufadienolides. Insects adapted to cardiotonic steroids typically have a number of amino acid substitutions, most often in the first extra-cellular loop of ATPα1, that confer resistance to cardiotonic steroid inhibition.

<text>The First English Civil War battle of Lansdowne, or Lansdown, was fought on 5 July 1643, at Lansdowne Hill, near Bath, Somerset, England. Although the Royalists under Lord Hopton forced the Parliamentarians under Sir William Waller to retreat from their hilltop position, they suffered so many casualties themselves and were left so disordered and short of ammunition that an injured Hopton was forced to retire.

==Prelude==
By late May 1643, Lord Hopton&#x27;s Royalist army had captured most of the south-west of England. Joined by the Marquess of Hertford, he then advanced eastward into Parliamentarian-held territory. Sir William Waller&#x27;s army held Bath, to obstruct their further advance. On 2 July 1643 the Royalists seized the bridge at Bradford-on-Avon. On 3 July, skirmishes took place at Claverton and at Waller&#x27;s positions south and east of Bath. Waller retired to a strong position on Lansdowne Hill, north-west of Bath while the main Royalist force moved north through Batheaston to Marshfield.

Hopton&#x27;s forces encountered Waller&#x27;s position on Lansdowne Hill on 4 July and were unpleasantly surprised at its strength. They withdrew north-east to Marshfield, while their rearguard repulsed an attempt by Waller&#x27;s cavalry to pursue them.

==Battle==
Early on 5 July 1643, Waller moved to the north end of Lansdowne Hill, where he built crude breastworks for his infantry, and sent some of his cavalry against Hopton&#x27;s outposts. The Parliamentarians put to flight some badly led Royalist cavalry, and the alarm caused all of Hopton&#x27;s army to form up and to begin advancing west until they came in sight of Waller&#x27;s position.

The two forces engaged in indecisive skirmishing for two hours until Waller tried to withdraw. Waller once again sent his horse and dragoons against the Royalists&#x27; rearguard, and this time they routed the Royalist cavalry, although the infantry stood firm. Hopton&#x27;s army then turned about and ultimately defeated the Roundhead cavalry in a confused action. With his Cornish foot regiments already advancing without orders, Hopton at last attacked Lansdowne Hill.

As they charged up the steep slopes towards the Parliamentarian position on the crest, Hopton&#x27;s cavalry suffered badly, and many panicked. As many as 1,400 of them fled, some as far as Oxford. Under Sir Bevil Grenville, Hopton&#x27;s Cornish pikemen stormed Waller&#x27;s breastworks, while Royalist musketeers outflanked Waller&#x27;s forces through the woods on each side of his position. Grenville was mortally wounded in hand-to-hand combat as the Parliamentarian horse cavalry counter-attacked and were driven off. Waller&#x27;s infantry fell back to a wall across the crest of the hill from where they kept up musket fire until darkness fell. During the night, they withdrew silently, leaving burning matches on the wall to deceive the Royalists that they still held the position.

==Aftermath==


The day after the battle, a Royalist ammunition cart exploded. Hopton was injured and temporarily blinded. The loss of the powder and the absence of most of their horse meant that the Royalists could not fight another action. Meanwhile, Waller had retired to Bath, where he was reinforced and was ready to attack again. Hopton&#x27;s army retreated in low spirits to Devizes. Hopton&#x27;s army was in such a poor situation before their retreat that Hopton&#x27;s military opponent but old friend Waller offered him hospitality in Bath, though the former refused it.

A Cornish officer describing the battle wrote that Waller was &quot;... the best shifter and chooser of ground when he was not Master of the field that ever I saw&quot;. (sic)

The site of the battle is marked by a monument to Sir Bevil Grenville, who died after the battle in Cold Ashton Rectory.
The battlefield is included on the Register of Historic Battlefields which is part of the National Heritage List for England.

<text>Herford () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northeastern part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Minden-Lübbecke, Lippe, the urban district of Bielefeld and the districts of Gütersloh and Osnabrück.

==History==
The region is also known as &quot;Wittekind&#x27;s land&quot;, as the last fights of Wittekind&#x27;s Saxon tribes against Charlemagne took place here. He is believed to be buried in the town of Enger.

When the area became part of the Prussian province of Westphalia, the first district, Herford, was created in 1816. In 1832 it was merged with the district of Bünde. In 1911 the city of Herford left the district; however it lost its status as an independent urban district in 1969. The district reached its current size in 1973 when the municipality of Uffeln, which was formerly in the district of Minden, was merged into the city Vlotho.

==Geography==
The district is located between the three mountain chains of the Wiehen Hills in the north and the Teutoburg Forest in the south. To the northeast it is bounded by the Weser river.

==Coat of arms==
The black horse of Wittekind is depicted in the coat of arms of the district. After Wittekind was baptized Charlemagne gave him a white horse as present, which is now in the coat of arms of North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony.

<doc id="182402" wikidata="Q54184" url="?curid=182402" title="Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship">
<text>Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship is a voivodeship (province) in northeastern Poland. Its capital and largest city is Olsztyn. The voivodeship has an area of and in 2019 had a population of 1,425,967.

Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 from the entire Olsztyn Voivodeship, the western half of Suwałki Voivodeship, and part of Elbląg Voivodeship, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. The province&#x27;s name derives from two historic regions, Warmia and Masuria, although also parts of other regions are located within the province, i.e. of Chełmno Land and Powiśle.

The province borders Podlaskie Voivodeship to the east, Masovian Voivodeship to the south, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship to the southwest, Pomeranian Voivodeship to the west, the Vistula Lagoon to the northwest, and the Kaliningrad Oblast (an exclave of Russia) to the north.

== History ==
The region was originally inhabited by several Old Prussian clans, including the Bartians, Pogesanians and Warmians, from whom the name &quot;Warmia&quot; originated. During the northern Crusade, the Old Prussians were conquered by the Teutonic Order; their land was granted to the order by the pope, and the region became part of the State of the Teutonic Order. The Order encouraged colonization by German settlers in Warmia (&quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;) and Polish colonists from the region of Masovia, called Masurians (&quot;Mazurzy&quot;), hence the name Masuria. The Old Prussians were heavily decimated during the crusade and the following revolt. What remained of them became assimilated into the newcomers and thus became extinct.

During the Teutonic rule, the region experienced a process of urbanization and economic boost due to the expansion of the Hanseatic League into the region. The Order later attacked their former ally Poland and conquered the region of Pomerelia, beginning a long-lasting conflict with Poland, which subsequently entered into an alliance with Lithuania. In Masuria, the Poles and Lithuanians defeated the Order at the Battle of Grunwald. The wars eventuated in a rebellion by the urban populations of Pomerelia and Warmia, who were affected by the Teutons&#x27; numerous wars; upon the urban populations&#x27; request, the region was incorporated into Poland by King Casimir IV Jagiellon, and after the Thirteen Years&#x27; War it remained under Polish suzerainty, but was divided into two parts: Elbląg and Warmia were incorporated directly into the Kingdom of Poland, while Masuria became a Polish fief under the control of the Teutonic Order, also considered an integral part of &quot;one and indivisible&quot; Kingdom of Poland.

The state of the Teutonic Order ceased to exist in 1525 when Grandmaster Albert Hohenzollern introduced secularisation, proclaimed the Duchy of Prussia, and became a vassal of Sigismund I of Poland. The Prussian Hohenzollern line became extinct in 1618 with the death of Albert Frederick, and the Duchy was inherited by the Brandenburgian line; Prussia simultaneously entered into a personal union with the electorate of Brandenburg known as Brandenburg-Prussia, remaining under Polish suzerainty until the Treaty of Oliva in 1660. The throne was inherited by Frederick I of Prussia who wanted to unite the Duchy with Brandenburg and also wanted to proclaim himself king of Prussia and therefore participated in the Russian-initiated Partitions of Poland in which Warmia was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, and henceforth became part of the newly established province of East Prussia. Together with the rest of the Kingdom, the region became part of the North German Confederation and the German Empire.

In 1914, the province turned into a battlefield, seeing notable battles such as the Battle of Tannenberg as part of the Eastern Front of World War I. Later, the region became part of the Weimar Republic, and Nazi Germany, whereas some areas in the south became again part of Poland, following the restoration of its independence in 1918. In the interbellum, the Polish population was subjected to persecution from both the pre-Nazi and Nazi authorities of Germany. With the German invasion of Poland at the start of World War II in 1939, the Germans eventually carried out mass arrests of local Poles, shut down or seized Polish newspapers and libraries, and occupied the pre-war Polish areas of the present-day province, in which they established the Soldau concentration camp, and carried out massacres of Poles, including at Bratian, Nawra, Malinowo and Komorniki. Several subcamps of the Stutthof concentration camp were located in the region. Stalag I-B, a major German prisoner-of-war camp for Polish, Belgian, French, Italian, Serbian and Soviet POWs, and Wolf&#x27;s Lair, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s first Eastern Front military headquarters were located in Masuria. After the end of World War II, the German population was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, whereas many Masurians emigrated in the following decades.

===Ethnic and religious structure===
In year 1824, shortly before its merger with West Prussia, the population of East Prussia was 1,080,000 people. Of that number, according to Karl Andree, Germans were slightly more than half, while 280,000 (~26%) were ethnically Polish and 200,000 (~19%) were ethnically Lithuanian, however large portions of its German and Lithuanian populations lived in the northern half of the region, outside of the present Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship. As of year 1819 there were also some 2,400 Jews, according to Georg Hassel. Similar numbers are given by August von Haxthausen in his 1839 book, with a breakdown by county. But the majority of East Prussian Polish and Lithuanian inhabitants were Lutherans, not Roman Catholics like their ethnic kinsmen across the border in the Russian Empire. Only in Southern Warmia Catholic Poles – so called Warmiaks (not to be confused with predominantly Protestant Masurians) – comprised the majority of population, numbering 26,067 people (~81%) in county Allenstein (Polish: Olsztyn) in 1837. Another minority in 19th-century East Prussia, were ethnically Russian Old Believers, also known as Philipponnen – their main town was Eckersdorf (Wojnowo). The Polish population was subjected to Germanisation and &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; policies.

In year 1817, East Prussia had 796,204 Evangelical Christians, 120,123 Roman Catholics, 864 Mennonites and 2,389 Jews.

The Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship has the largest number of ethnic Ukrainians living in Poland due to forced relocations (such as Operation Vistula) carried out by the Soviet and Polish Communist authorities.

Pasłęk in the western part of the voivodeship is considered the first place in present-day Poland where Dutch immigrants settled (in 1297). There is a claim that they were participants in the killing of Floris V, Count of Holland in 1296, who then fled east, which is alluded to by Dutch poet Joost van den Vondel in his work &quot;Gijsbrechcie van Aemstel&quot; (1637).

== Cities and towns ==


The Voivodeship contains three cities and 47 towns. These are listed below in descending order of population (according to official figures for 2019):

== Administrative division ==
Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship is divided into 21 counties (powiaty): two city counties and 19 land counties. These are further divided into 116 gminas.

The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population).

== Sights and tourism ==

Amongst the most visited sights is the Masurian Lake District, which contains more than 2,000 lakes, including the largest lakes of Poland, Śniardwy and Mamry. Giżycko, Iława, Mrągowo, Mikołajki and Ruciane-Nida are thus popular summer destinations.

Other recognizable landmarks are the Warmian castles (Lidzbark Warmiński Castle, Pieniężno Castle, Olsztyn Castle) and the Cathedral Hill in Frombork, where Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus lived and worked, and which contains his tomb. In collections of the Warmia and Mazury Museum in Olsztyn, visitors can find numerous tokens from the time when Nicolaus Copernicus lived in Warmia. The Lidzbark Warmiński Castle was later the residence of Ignacy Krasicki, nicknamed &quot;the Prince of Polish Poets&quot;. There are also multiple other Gothic castles and palaces in various styles in the voivodeship. Święta Lipka in Masuria and Gietrzwałd in Warmia are popular pilgrimage sites, and other notable historic churches include the Gothic collegiate church in Dobre Miasto and churches in Orneta and Kętrzyn, which delight visitors with the uniqueness of their architectonic details. Several towns contain entirely or partly preserved medieval town walls with towers and gates, i.e. Lidzbark Warmiński, Nowe Miasto Lubawskie, Pasłęk.
The Elbląg Canal is considered one of the greatest landmarks of the western part of the province. The Grunwald battlefield in Masuria is site of the annual reenactment of one of the largest battles of Medieval Europe. Gołdap is a spa town in the north-eastern part of the province. There is a museum dedicated to composer Feliks Nowowiejski at his birthplace in Barczewo.

There are multiple World War II memorials in the voivodeship, including at the site of the Soldau concentration camp in Działdowo, at the locations of Nazi massacres of Poles, and the war cemetery in Sudwa, where victims of the Stalag I-B German prisoner-of-war camp were buried. The Wolf&#x27;s Lair, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s first Eastern Front military headquarters in World War II is located in Gierłoż.

There is a small cemetery of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Markajmy at which British and Commonwealth prisoners-of-war of Germany from World War I are buried.

==Protected areas==
Protected areas in Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship include eight areas designated as Landscape Parks, as listed below:

* Brodnica Landscape Park (partly in Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship)
* Dylewo Hills Landscape Park
* Elbląg Upland Landscape Park
* Górzno-Lidzbark Landscape Park (partly in Kuyavian-Pomeranian and Masovian Voivodeships)
* Iława Lake District Landscape Park (partly in Pomeranian Voivodeship)
* Masurian Landscape Park
* Puszcza Romincka Landscape Park
* Wel Landscape Park

The Łuknajno Lake nature reserve (part of Masurian Landscape Park) is a protected wetland site under the Ramsar convention, as well as being designated by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve.

==Cuisine==
In addition to traditional nationwide Polish cuisine, Warmian–Masurian Voivodeship has its variety of traditional foods and drinks, specific to its Warmia and Masuria regions, officially protected by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland. Masuria produces several types of various meat products, especially kiełbasa, and a plethora of traditional Polish honey. Masuria also shares with neighboring Podlaskie Voivodeship the tradition of producing sękacz, a traditional spit cake of northeastern Poland.

<doc id="182407" wikidata="Q455618" url="?curid=182407" title="Thomas Campion">
<text>Thomas Campion (sometimes spelled Campian; 12 February 1567 – 1 March 1620) was an English composer, poet, and physician. He was born in London, educated at Cambridge, and studied law in Gray&#x27;s Inn. He wrote over a hundred lute songs, masques for dancing, and an authoritative technical treatise on music.

==Life==

Campion was born in London, the son of John Campion, a clerk of the Court of Chancery, and Lucy (née Searle – daughter of Laurence Searle, one of the Queen&#x27;s serjeants-at-arms). Upon the death of Campion&#x27;s father in 1576, his mother married Augustine Steward, dying soon afterwards. His stepfather assumed charge of the boy and sent him, in 1581, to study at Peterhouse, Cambridge as a &quot;gentleman pensioner&quot;; he left the university after four years without taking a degree. He later entered Gray&#x27;s Inn to study law in 1586. However, he left in 1595 without having been called to the bar.

On 10 February 1605, he received his medical degree from the University of Caen.

Campion is thought to have lived in London, practising as a physician, until his death in March 1620 – possibly of the plague. He was apparently unmarried and had no children. He was buried the same day at St Dunstan-in-the-West in Fleet Street.

He was implicated in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, but was eventually exonerated, as it was found that he had &quot;unwittingly&quot; delivered the bribe that had procured Overbury&#x27;s death.

==Poetry and songs==

The body of his works is considerable, the earliest known being a group of five anonymous poems included in the &quot;Songs of Divers Noblemen and Gentlemen&quot;, appended to Newman&#x27;s edition of Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot;, which appeared in 1591. In 1595, &quot;Poemata, a collection of Latin panegyrics, elegies and epigrams&quot; was published, winning him a considerable reputation. This was followed, in 1601, by a songbook, &quot;A Booke of Ayres&quot;, with words by himself and music composed by himself and Philip Rosseter. The following year he published his &quot;Observations in the Art of English Poesie&quot;, &quot;against the vulgar and unartificial custom of riming,&quot; in favour of rhymeless verse on the model of classical quantitative verse. Campion&#x27;s theories on poetry were criticised by Samuel Daniel in &quot;Defence of Rhyme&quot; (1603).

In 1607, he wrote and published a masque for the occasion of the marriage of Lord Hayes, and, in 1613, issued a volume of &quot;Songs of Mourning: Bewailing the Untimely Death of Prince Henry&quot;, set to music by John Cooper (also known as Coperario). The same year he wrote and arranged three masques: &quot;The Lords&#x27; Masque&quot; for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth; an entertainment for the amusement of Queen Anne at Caversham House; and a third masque for the marriage of the Earl of Somerset to the infamous Frances Howard, Countess of Essex. If, moreover, as appears quite likely, his &quot;Two Bookes of Ayres&quot; (both words and music written by himself) belongs also to this year, it was indeed his &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;.

In 1615, he published a book on counterpoint, &quot;A New Way of Making Fowre Parts in Counterpoint By a Most Familiar and Infallible Rule&quot;, a technical treatise which was for many years the standard textbook on the subject. It was included, with annotations by Christopher Sympson, in Playford&#x27;s &quot;Brief Introduction to the Skill of Musick&quot;, and two editions appear to have been published by 1660.

Some time in or after 1617 appeared his &quot;Third and Fourth Booke of Ayres&quot;. In 1618 appeared the airs that were sung and played at Brougham Castle on the occasion of the King&#x27;s entertainment there, the music by George Mason and John Earsden, while the words were almost certainly by Campion. In 1619, he published his &quot;Epigrammatum Libri II. Umbra Elegiarum liber unus&quot;, a reprint of his 1595 collection with considerable omissions, additions (in the form of another book of epigrams) and corrections.

==Legacy==

Campion made a nuncupative will on 1 March 1619/20 before &quot;divers credible witnesses&quot;: a memorandum was made that he did &quot;not longe before his death say that he did give all that he had unto Mr Phillip Rosseter, and wished that his estate had bin farre more&quot;, and Rosseter was sworn before Dr Edmund Pope to administer as principal legatee on 3 March 1619/20.

While Campion had attained a considerable reputation in his own day, in the years that followed his death his works sank into complete oblivion. No doubt this was due to the nature of the media in which he mainly worked, the masque and the song-book. The masque was an amusement at any time too costly to be popular, and during the Commonwealth period it was practically extinguished. The vogue of the song-books was even more ephemeral, and, as in the case of the masque, the Puritan ascendancy, with its distaste for all secular music, effectively put an end to the madrigal. Its loss involved that of many hundreds of dainty lyrics, including those of Campion, and it was due to the work of A. H. Bullen (see bibliography), who first published a collection of the poet&#x27;s works in 1889, that his genius was recognised and his place among the foremost rank of Elizabethan lyric poets restored.

Early dictionary writers, such as Fétis, saw Campion as a theorist. It was much later on that people began to see him as a composer. He was the writer of a poem, &quot;Cherry Ripe&quot;, which is not the later famous poem of that title but has several similarities.

===In popular culture===
Repeated reference was made to Campion (1567–1620) in an October 2010 episode of the BBC TV series &quot;James May&#x27;s Man Lab&quot; (BBC2), where his works are used as the inspiration for a young man trying to serenade a female colleague. This segment was referenced in the second and third series of the programme as well.

Occasional mention is made of Campion (&quot;Campian&quot;) in the comic strip &quot;9 Chickweed Lane&quot; (i.e., 5 April 2004), referencing historical context for playing the lute.

<doc id="182410" wikidata="Q3546736" url="?curid=182410" title="Television in the United Kingdom">
<text>Television broadcasts in the United Kingdom began in 1932, however, regular broadcasts would only begin four years later. Television began as a public service which was free of advertising, which followed the first demonstration of a transmitted moving image in 1926. Currently, the United Kingdom has a collection of free-to-air, free-to-view and subscription services over a variety of distribution media, through which there are over 480 channels for consumers as well as on-demand content. There are six main channel owners who are responsible for most material viewed.

There are 27,000 hours of domestic content produced a year, at a cost of £2.6 billion. Since 24 October 2012, all television broadcasts in the United Kingdom have been in a digital format, following the end of analogue transmissions in Northern Ireland. Digital content is delivered via terrestrial, satellite and cable, as well as over IP. As of 2003, 53.2% of households watch through terrestrial, 31.3% through satellite, and 15.6% through cable.

The Royal Television Society (RTS) is a British-based educational charity for the discussion and analysis of television in all its forms, past, present, and future. It is the oldest television society in the world.

== Broadcast television providers ==
Free-to-air, free-to-view and subscription providers operate, with differences in the number of channels, capabilities such as the programme guide (EPG), video on demand (VOD), high-definition (HD), interactive television via the red button, and coverage across the UK. All providers make available the UK&#x27;s five most-watched channels: BBC One, BBC Two, ITV (ITV1/STV), Channel 4 and Channel 5.

Broadcast television is distributed as radio waves via terrestrial or satellite transmissions, or as electrical or light signals through ground-based cables. In the UK, these use the Digital Video Broadcasting standard. Most TVs sold in the UK (as well as much of the rest of Europe) come with a DVB-T (terrestrial) tuner. Set-top boxes are generally used to receive channels from other providers. All of the traditional services have integrated their broadcast TV with streamed channels or on-demand programmes when connected to the Internet. Since 2022, broadcast-like TV services can be wholly-received via Internet-connected devices, which don&#x27;t require an aerial, satellite or a traditional cable TV connection.


Barb Audiences publish quarterly statistics of the number of UK households per broadcast TV platform. The following table shows a summary of TV availability for Quarter 4 2024 and earlier quarters. Some of the figures are derived from others and will contain inaccuracies as Barb&#x27;s data doesn&#x27;t state the overlap between different combinations of technologies.

=== Digital terrestrial television ===


The primary digital terrestrial TV service, Freeview, launched in 2002 and is free-of-charge to view. It replaced the subscription service named ONdigital or ITV Digital, which ran from 1998 to 2002. Digital terrestrial television was itself the replacement for analogue terrestrial TV, which ran from 1936 to 2012.

, Freeview provides over seventy TV and radio channels, which are received via an aerial. It is operated by Everyone TV and DTV Services Ltd., joint ventures between the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. The transmitter network is predominately operated by Arqiva.

The TV channels are transmitted in bundles, called multiplexes, and the available channels are dependent on how many multiplexes are transmitted in each area. The six national multiplexes are available to 90% of households from 92 transmitters; and three multiplexes are available to 9% of households from 1,067 transmitters. In Northern Ireland, a multiplex carrying channels from the Republic of Ireland can reach 71% of Northern Irish households from 3 transmitters. Local TV and radio is available to 54% of households from an additional multiplex via 44 transmitters, and an extra multiplex is available to 54% of households in Greater Manchester.

Multiple vendors sell hybrid set-top-boxes or smart TVs which combine terrestrial channels with streamed (Internet TV) content. Internet-based TV apps such as BBC iPlayer, ITVX and Channel 4 are available via the broadband connection of Freeview Play and Netgem devices. These also support optional subscription services such as Netflix and Prime Video. EE TV and TalkTalk TV offer additional subscription services for their respective broadband customers using Netgem or YouView devices.

Saorview, the terrestrial TV service in the Republic of Ireland which launched in 2011, can be received in parts of Northern Ireland via overspill transmissions.

=== Cable television ===
Many regional companies developed cable-television services in the late 1980s and 1990s as licences for cable television were awarded on a city-by-city basis. The mid-1990s saw the companies start to merge and the turn of the century only three big companies remained. In 2007 Telewest and NTL merged, resulting in the formation of Virgin Media, which is available to 55% of households. Cable TV is a subscription service normally bundled with a phone line and broadband.

=== Satellite television ===

There are two distinctly-marketed direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) services (also known as direct-to-home (DTH), to be distinguished from satellite signals intended for non-consumer reception).

Sky TV is a subscription service operated by Sky Ltd, owned by Comcast, which launched in 1998 as SkyDigital. Compared to the previous analogue service which had launched in 1989, it provided more channels, widescreen, interactive TV and a near video-on-demand service using staggered start times for pay-per-view content. Innovations since have included high definition, 3D TV, a digital video recorder, the ability to view recordings on other devices, remote operation via the Internet to add recordings, and on-demand content via the satellite-receiver&#x27;s broadband connection of both Sky and third-party TV. The Sky subscription also includes access to Sky Go, which allows mobile devices and computers to access subscription content via the Internet.

Freesat is a free satellite service operated by Everyone TV, who also operate Freeview. Like Sky, it provides high-definition content, digital recording and video-on-demand via the broadband connection.

Freesat and Sky TV transmit from SES Astra satellites at 28.2° east (Astra 2E/2F/2G). As the satellites are in geostationary orbit, they are positioned above the earth&#x27;s equator () approximately 35,786 km above sea level; this places them above the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

== Internet video services ==


TV via the Internet can be streamed or downloaded, and consist of amateur or professionally produced content. In the UK, most broadcasters provide catch-up TV services which allow viewing of TV for a window after it was broadcast. Online video can be viewed via mobile devices, computers, TVs equipped with a built in Internet connection, or TVs connected to an external set-top-box, streaming stick or games console. Most of the broadcast TV providers have integrated their set-top-boxes with Internet video to provide a hybrid broadcast and online service.

=== Catch-up services ===

Since 2006, UK channel owners and content producers have been creating Internet services to access their programmes. Often, these are available for a window after the broadcast schedule. These services generally block users outside of the UK.

=== Online video services for professionally produced content ===

There are numerous online services targeting the UK, offering a combination of subscription, rental and purchase options for viewing online TV. Most are available via any Internet connection, however some require a specific broadband provider. Some services sell 3rd party services, such as Amazon&#x27;s Prime Video.

Barb tracks the number of households subscribing to subscription video-on-demand services. Their statistics for Q3 2024 show that 69% of households subscribe to at least one of these.

The table following is the number of subscribers per service according to Barb&#x27;s Q3 2024 figures. Barb&#x27;s data excludes services with a household penetration below 5% (1.5 million households), omitting services like ITVX Premium. It also omits services linked to a broadcast TV subscription, like Sky Go, and free services like BBC iPlayer, as they don&#x27;t have a paid subscription.

The table following summarises some of the available Internet TV services in the UK. For brevity, it does not include catch-up-only or amateur-only services, individual channels, distributors of illegal or adult content, services which solely redistribute free broadcast channels, portals, or services which don&#x27;t target the UK. &#x27;Free&#x27; refers to free at the point of consumption, not including fees for Internet connectivity or a TV licence.

Other international streaming services with pricing in GBP include: Acorn TV, Arrow, BroadwayHD, CHILI, Crunchyroll, Curiosity Stream, DAFilms, Dekkoo, Demand Africa, Docsville, GuideDoc, Hayu, Hoichoi, Hotstar, iQiyi, iWantTFC, Klassiki, Magellan TV, MovieSaints, Mubi, NewsPlayer+, Shahid VIP, Shudder, Spamflix, True Story, TVPlayer, WOW Presents Plus and ZEE5.

=== Viewing statistics ===

==== Most viewed channels ====
Barb Audiences measures television ratings in the UK. As of November 2024, the average daily viewing time per home was 2 hours 54 minutes (of Barb-reported channels, includes broadcast and Internet viewings). 13 channels have a monthly share of ≥ 1.0%, as well as non-linear (streamed) viewing of BBC and ITV plc. programmes.


==== Most viewed broadcaster groups ====

As of November 2024, there are 10 broadcaster groups with a monthly share of ≥ 1.0% (although Barb reports sub-groups of BBC and Paramount individually, and it&#x27;s unclear what the &#x27;ITV&#x27; group refers to).


=== BBC and UKTV ===


The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is the world&#x27;s oldest and largest broadcaster, and is the country&#x27;s principal public service broadcaster of radio and television. BBC Television is funded primarily by a television licence and from sales of its programming to overseas markets. It does not carry advertising. The licence fee is levied on all households that watch or record TV as it is broadcast and the fee is determined by periodic negotiation between the government and the BBC.

Its first analogue terrestrial channel was launched by the BBC Television Service in 1936. It rebranded to BBC1 in 1964 following the launch of BBC2, the UK&#x27;s third analogue terrestrial channel after ITV. BBC News 24 launched as an analogue cable channel in 1997, later rebranding to BBC News in 2008. BBC Parliament, which was originally an analogue cable channel known as The Parliamentary Channel, was acquired by the BBC in 1998. From 1998 onwards the BBC started digital TV transmissions, launching new channels and broadcasting via satellite in addition to terrestrial and cable.

The BBC&#x27;s Internet-based service iPlayer contains content from the BBC&#x27;s TV channels, the Welsh-language public-service broadcaster S4C, as well as videos created from BBC radio programmes.

UKTV is a commercial broadcaster owned by BBC Studios, one of the BBC&#x27;s commercial units. Originating in 1992 with UK Gold, UKTV expanded its channels from 1997 onwards, with the BBC taking full ownership in June 2019. Unlike the BBC&#x27;s public service channels, the UKTV channels contain advertising.

=== ITV ===

ITV, branded as ITV1 or STV, is the network of fourteen regional and one national commercial television franchise, founded in 1955 to provide competition to the BBC. ITV was the country&#x27;s first commercial television provider funded by advertisements. Each region was originally independent and used its own on-air identity. Through a series of mergers following relaxation of regulation in 1990, thirteen of the franchises are now held by ITV plc, and the remaining two by STV Group. Since 2012, ITV plc produces the network nationally, with STV Group acting as an affiliate.

STV Group uses the channel name of &quot;STV&quot; for its two franchises in Scotland. ITV plc names the channel &quot;UTV&quot; in Northern Ireland, and &quot;ITV1&quot; for the remaining regions, although UTV has used ITV or ITV1 branding since April 2020. The national breakfast-time franchise is held by ITV plc, which appears as an indistinguishable programming block across the network. Legally, the network has been known as &quot;Channel 3&quot; since 1990, which is the name Ofcom uses.

ITV plc or its predecessor companies created additional free or subscription channels, of which the oldest still running is ITV2, having launched in 1998. Several older channels have since stopped broadcasting; the oldest of these is Super Channel which was launched by a consortium of ITV regional companies in 1987, was sold and eventually closed in 1998.

=== Channel 4 ===
Launched in 1982, Channel 4 is a state-owned national broadcaster which is funded by its commercial activities (including advertising). Channel 4 has expanded greatly after gaining greater independence from the IBA, especially in the multi-channel digital world launching E4, Film4, More4, 4Music, 4seven and various timeshift services. Since 2005, it has been a member of the Freeview consortium, and operates one of the six digital terrestrial multiplexes with ITV as Digital 3&amp;4. Since the advent of digital television, Channel 4 is now also broadcast in Wales across all digital platforms. Channel 4 was the first British channel not to carry regional variations for programming, however it does have six set advertising regions.

=== Sky ===

Sky is a European broadcaster owned by global American media conglomerate Comcast. Sky Television launched in 1989, with a 4-channel service received via satellite. The channels at launch were Sky Channel, Sky News, Sky Movies and Eurosport. They were initially free to receive, and Sky Movies was the first to move to a subscription early in 1990. Sky News was the UK&#x27;s first dedicated news channel. The new service was the UK&#x27;s first consumer satellite TV service, beating rival BSB, with which Sky would later merge to become BSkyB. Sky&#x27;s satellite service grew to become a subscription platform through which Sky offer their own channels, pay-per-view services and channels from other broadcasters. Sky&#x27;s digital platform launched in 1998, with the original analogue service closing in 2001. Sky was acquired by Comcast in 2018.

Since 2012, Sky operate Now, an Internet TV streaming service offering subscriptions without a fixed-term contract.

Sky&#x27;s channel portfolio has grown greatly since the launch of digital TV. Sky make their channels available via rival cable and Internet services as well as their own satellite service and Now.

=== Paramount Global ===


Channel 5 was the fifth analogue terrestrial channel to launch, in March 1997. Due to constraints with the available UHF frequencies at the time, many households had to retune their video recorders, which shared the frequency on their RF output with the frequency used by Channel 5&#x27;s new broadcasts. Channel 5 was the first terrestrial channel to also broadcast via satellite. From 2006 onwards, Channel 5 launched new digital channels and an Internet on-demand service. After changing ownership several times, in May 2014 Channel 5 and its sister channels were acquired by Viacom, an American media conglomerate, known as Paramount since 2022.

By the time it acquired Channel 5, Paramount already operated a large number of subscription channels in the UK, including the MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central channels, which are available via Sky TV, Virgin Media and Now. In terms of viewing share, the combined viewing across Paramount&#x27;s channels make the group the UK&#x27;s fifth largest broadcaster, according to Barb&#x27;s viewing figures for 1 March 2020.

Paramount additionally operates the Pluto TV and Paramount+ Internet streaming services.

== Local and regional television ==

=== Local television ===


Since 2012, additional local TV channels are available via Freeview channel 7 or 8. The channels are licensed by Ofcom, with 34 local TV channels licensed as of 2 July 2020. Nineteen of the licenses are held by That&#x27;s TV, and eight are held by Made Television. The remainder are held independently. Each license contains the amount of local TV programming required. As an example, the license for Scarborough, which is held by That&#x27;s TV, requires seven hours of local programming per week (one hour per day on average). Thirteen additional licenses were originally intended, but Ofcom decided not to advertise these in June 2018.

The way Ofcom structured local television – being dependent on terrestrial transmission – was criticised in a &quot;Guardian&quot; article in 2015 for being &quot;years behind in its thinking&quot;, as it does not account for the Internet. In the article, Ofcom responded that the licensing scheme was inherited from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. In April 2018, BBC News reported that &quot;many of the stations have been ridiculed for the poor quality of their output or have been reported to Ofcom for breaching broadcasting rules&quot;. The local TV companies receive a subsidy from the BBC of £147.50 per local news story, funded by the license fee, paid whether the BBC uses the content or not. A June 2018 article on BuzzFeed claimed that That&#x27;s TV was created &quot;primarily to extract money from the BBC whilst delivering little content of useful value&quot;.

=== Regional television ===

BBC One, BBC Two and the ITV network (comprising ITV1 and STV) are split into regions in which regional news and other programming is broadcast. ITV1/STV is split into fourteen geographic licencees, with several of these split into two or three sub-regions, resulting in a greater total number of regional news programmes. Ofcom sets a quota for the BBC and ITV on the amount of regional programming required, shown in the following table. Ofcom&#x27;s quota for S4C is 60 hours per week.

Advertising on ITV1/STV and Channel 4 is regional. Linear Channel 4 is split into 6 advertising regions, but has no regional programming.

=== Country-specific channels ===

BBC Scotland and the Gaelic-language channel BBC Alba target Scotland, and the Welsh-language channel S4C targets Wales. In Northern Ireland, channels originating in the Republic of Ireland are available, including RTÉ One, RTÉ2 and the Irish-language TG4.

== Programming ==

British television differs from other countries, such as the United States, in as much that programmes produced in the United Kingdom do not generally have a long season run of around 20 weeks. Instead, they are produced in a series, a set of episodes varying in length, usually aired over a period of a few months. See List of British television series.

=== 100 Greatest British Television Programmes ===
100 Greatest British Television Programmes was a list compiled in 2000 by the British Film Institute (BFI), chosen by a poll of industry professionals, to determine what were the greatest British television programmes of any genre ever to have been screened. Although not including any programmes made in 2000 or later, the list is useful as an indication of what were generally regarded as the most successful British programmes of the 20th century. The top 10 programmes are:

=== Terrestrial channel programming ===

==== Weekday ====

Weekday programming on terrestrial channels begins at 6 am with breakfast national news programmes (along with regional news updates) on &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; on BBC One and &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; on ITV, with Channel 5 showing children&#x27;s programmes under the &quot;Milkshake!&quot; brand. Channel 4 predominately broadcasts comedy programmes such as &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; in its morning slot. The weekday breakfast news programme ends at 9:30am on BBC One and 9am on ITV.

Following this on BBC One, lifestyle programming is generally shown, including property, auction and home and gardening. BBC One continues this genre until after the lunchtime news, whereby afternoon has various factual shows and dramas. BBC Two airs the BBC News updates and political programming between 9 am and 1 pm. Channel 4 often shows home-project and archaeology lifestyle programming in the early afternoon after a &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; summary. Channel 5 broadcasts chat show programmes in the morning including &quot;Jeremy Vine&quot; with regular news bulletins. In the afternoon, it shows dramas followed by an hour of Australian soaps such as &quot;Home and Away&quot; and &quot;Neighbours&quot; and films.

News bulletins are broadcast between 6 pm and 7 pm on both BBC One and ITV, with BBC One beginning with the national BBC News at Six and ITV with the flagship regional news programme. At around 6:30 pm, BBC One broadcasts the regional news programmes whilst ITV broadcasts the ITV Evening News. Channel 4 News starts at 7 pm and 5 News broadcasts for an hour at 5 pm.

Primetime programming is usually dominated by further soaps, including &quot;EastEnders&quot; on BBC One, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; on ITV, and &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; on Channel 4. These soap operas or &#x27;continuing dramas&#x27; as they are now called can vary throughout the year, however weekly dramas, such as &quot;Holby City&quot;, are also fixed to scheduling. BBC Two broadcasts factual programming, including lifestyle and documentaries. BBC Four begins programming at 7pm. The channel shows a wide variety of programmes including arts, documentaries, music, international film, comedy, original programmes, drama and current affairs. It is required by its licence to air at least 100 hours of new arts and music programmes, 110 hours of new factual programmes and to premiere 20 foreign films each year. BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 broadcast dramas and documentaries in the evenings. At 10pm with the flagship national news on BBC One in BBC News at Ten (followed by Newsnight on BBC Two) and on ITV on ITV News at Ten followed by the regional late night news. Because of this, the UK can often rely more heavily on TV guides, be it with the newspaper, online, via information services on the television such as the BBC Red Button service or the built in Electronic Programme Guides.

==== Weekend ====

Weekend daytime programming traditionally consists of more lifestyle programming plus films and live and recorded coverage of sporting events on most weekend afternoons. There are further battles for viewers in the weekend primetime slot, often featuring documentaries and game shows in the evening. Lunchtime, early evening and late evening news programmes continue on BBC One and ITV although the length of the bulletins are shorter than during the week. Sunday night schedules usually consist of dramas, light entertainment, documentaries, films, music concerts, festivals or sporting events.

== Cultural impact ==

=== Christian morality ===

In 1963 Mary Whitehouse, incensed by the liberalising policies followed by Sir Hugh Greene, then director general of the BBC, began her letter writing campaign. She subsequently launched the Clean Up TV Campaign, and founded the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association in 1965. In 2008, Toby Young in an article for &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote: &quot;On the wider question of whether sex and violence on TV has led to a general moral collapse in society at large, the jury is still out. No one doubts that Western civilization is teetering on the brink ... but it is unfair to lay the blame entirely at the feet of BBC2 and Channel 4.&quot;

In 2005, the BBC&#x27;s broadcast of &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot; elicited 55,000 complaints, and provoked protests from Christian organisation Christian Voice, and a private prosecution against the BBC by the Christian Institute. A summons was not issued.

== Awards ==

The British Academy Television Awards are the most prestigious awards given in the British television industry, analogous to the Emmy Awards in the United States. They have been awarded annually since 1954, and are only open to British programmes. After all the entries have been received, they are voted for online by all eligible members of the Academy. The winner is chosen from the four nominees by a special jury of nine academy members for each award, the members of each jury selected by the Academy&#x27;s Television Committee.

The National Television Awards is a British television awards ceremony, sponsored by ITV and initiated in 1995. Although not widely held to be as prestigious as the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards are probably the most prominent ceremony for which the results are voted on by the general public. Unlike the BAFTAs, the National Television Awards allow foreign programmes to be nominated, providing they have been screened on a British channel during the eligible time period.

== Regulation ==

Ofcom is the independent regulator and competition authority for the communication industries in the United Kingdom, including television. As the regulatory body for media broadcasts, Ofcom&#x27;s duties include:
* Specification of the Broadcast Code, which took effect on 25 July 2005, with the latest version being published October 2008. The Code itself is published on Ofcom&#x27;s website, and provides a mandatory set of rules which broadcast programmes must comply with. The 10 main sections cover protection of under-eighteens, harm and offence, crime, religion, impartiality and accuracy, elections, fairness, privacy, sponsorship and commercial references. As stipulated in the Communications Act 2003, Ofcom enforces adherence to the Code. Failure for a broadcaster to comply with the Code results in warnings, fines, and potentially revokation of a broadcasting licence.
* Rules on the amount and distribution of advertising, which also took effect July 2005
* Examining specific complaints by viewers or other bodies about programmes and sponsorship. Ofcom issues Broadcast Bulletins on a fortnightly basis which are accessible via its web site. As an example, a bulletin from February 2009 has a complaint from the National Heart Forum over sponsorship of The Simpsons by Domino&#x27;s Pizza on Sky One. Ofcom concluded this was in breach of the Broadcast Code, since it contravened an advertising restriction of food high in fat, salt or sugar. (Restrictions in food and drink advertising to children were introduced in November 2006.)
* The management, regulation and assignment of the electromagnetic spectrum in the UK, and licensing of portions of the spectrum for television broadcasting
* Public consultations on matters relating to TV broadcasting. The results of the consultations are published by Ofcom, and inform the policies that Ofcom creates and enforces.

In 2008, Ofcom issued fines to the total of £7.7m. This included £5.67m of fines to ITV companies, including a £3m fine to LWT over voting irregularities on Saturday Night Takeaway, and fines totalling £495,000 to the BBC. Ofcom said phone-in scandals had contributed significantly to the fine totals.

The Committee for Advertising Practice (CAP, or BCAP) is the body contracted by Ofcom to create and maintain the codes of practice governing television advertising. The Broadcast Advertising Codes (or the TV codes) are accessible on CAP&#x27;s web site. The Codes cover advertising standards (the TV Code), guidance notes, scheduling rules, text services (the Teletext Code) and interactive television guidance. The main sections of the TV Code concern compliance, programmes and advertising, unacceptable products, political and controversial issues, misleading advertising, harm and offence, children, medicines, treatments, health claims and nutrition, finance and investments, and religion.

The Advertising Standards Authority is an independent body responsible for resolving complaints relating to the advertising industry within the UK. It is not government funded, but funded by a levy on the advertising industry. It ensures compliance with the Codes created by CAP. The ASA covers all forms of advertising, not just television advertisements. The ASA can refer problematic adverts to Ofcom, since the channels carrying the adverts are ultimately responsible for the advertising content, and are answerable to Ofcom. Ofcom can issue fines or revoke broadcast licences if necessary.

== Licensing ==
In the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies, a television licence is required to receive any publicly broadcast television service, or for using BBC iPlayer. This includes the commercial channels, cable and satellite transmissions, Internet-streamed channels, and applies regardless of the technology used to view. The money from the licence fee is used to provide radio, television and Internet content for the BBC, Welsh-language television programmes for S4C, monitoring of global mass media, nine orchestras and performing groups, technical research, and contributions to broadband roll out. The fee is classified as a hypothecated tax rather than a subscription. The BBC gives the following figures for expenditure of licence fee income per month in 2021/2022:

== Production ==

As of 2002, 27,000 hours of original programming are produced year in the UK television industry, excluding news, at a cost of £2.6bn. Ofcom has determined that 56% (£1.5bn) of production is in-house by the channel owners, and the remainder by independent production companies. Ofcom is enforcing a 25% independent production quota for the channel operators, as stipulated in the Broadcasting Act 1990.

=== In-house production ===

ITV plc, the company which owns 12 of the 15 regional ITV franchises, has set its production arm ITV Studios a target of producing 75% of the ITV schedule, the maximum allowed by Ofcom. This would be a rise from 54% at present, as part of a strategy to make ITV content-led chiefly to double production revenues to £1.2bn by 2012. ITV Studios currently produces programmes such as &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat&quot;.

In contrast, the BBC has implemented a Window of Creative Competition (WOCC), a 25% proportion over and above the 25% Ofcom quota in which the BBC&#x27;s in-house production and independent producers can compete. The BBC produces shows such as &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; and &quot;F***off I&#x27;m a Hairy Woman&quot;.

Channel 4 commissions all programmes from independent producers.

=== Independent production ===

As a consequence of the launch of Channel 4 in 1982, and the 25% independent quota from the Broadcasting Act 1990, an independent production sector has grown in the UK. Notable companies include Talkback Thames, Endemol UK, Hat Trick Productions, and Tiger Aspect Productions. A full list can be seen here: :Category:Television production companies of the United Kingdom

=== Closed and aborted television providers ===


The following Internet TV services have closed:

The following services were aborted before launch:
* Sky Picnic, a proposed subscription digital terrestrial service from Sky in 2007
* &#x27;Project Kangaroo&#x27;, an Internet TV service announced by the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 in 2007. Some of the technology was reused in SeeSaw. A similar concept later launched as BritBox.

==== Analogue terrestrial television ====

Analogue TV was transmitted via VHF (1936) and later UHF (1964) radio waves, with analogue broadcasts ending in 2012.

VHF transmissions started in 1936 and closed in 1985 (with a gap 1939–1946), carrying two channels. The launch channel was the BBC Television Service, known as BBC1 since 1964. This was joined by Independent Television, a network of regional franchises launching between 1955 and 1962. The channels transmitted in monochrome using the 405-line television system, with 376 visible lines, at 25 interlaced frames per second (50 fields per second), initially with an aspect ratio of 5:4, switching to 4:3 in 1950. The phased closure started in 1982 and completed in January 1985.

UHF transmissions started in 1964 and closed in 2012. The launch channel was BBC2. This would be joined by BBC1, the ITV network, Channel 4 or S4C in Wales, Channel 5 as well as a network of local TV channels. Transmissions started using the System I standard, a 625-line monochrome picture, with 576 visible lines, at 25 interlaced frames/second (50 fields/second) and a 4:3 aspect ratio. Technical advancements included colour (1967), teletext (1974), and stereo sound (1991). The drive to switch viewers from analogue to digital transmissions was a regional process called the digital switchover, which started in 2007 and completed in October 2012 when analogue UHF transmissions ceased in Northern Ireland.

Whilst there are no longer any analogue broadcasts in the UK, a PAL signal may be present in closed RF distribution systems, e.g. a video feed from an intercom in a block of flats, or a security system.

=== Defunct channels ===

There are nearly 200 defunct British channels. For a list, see List of former TV channels in the UK or :Category:Defunct television channels in the United Kingdom.

==== The rise of television in the UK ====

The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was established in 1927 to develop radio broadcasting, and inevitably became involved in TV in 1936. The BBC is funded by income from a &quot;Broadcast Receiving Licence&quot; purchased by UK residents. The cost of this is set by agreement with the UK Government.

Television caught on in the United Kingdom in 1947, but its expansion was slow. By 1951, with only two transmitters, near London and Birmingham, only 9% of British homes owned a television set. The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to have a regular daily television schedule direct to homes, and it was the first to have technical professions to work on TVs.

Up until 1972, television broadcasting hours were tightly regulated by the British government, under the control of the Postmaster General. Before the launch of the commercial channel ITV in 1955, the BBC was restricted by law to just five hours maximum of television in a day. This was increased at the launch of the commercial channel ITV to a 7-hour broadcasting day for both channels. Gradually the number of hours were increased. Typically, during the late 1960s, the law regulated a 50-hour broadcasting week for all television channels in the UK. This that meant BBC1, BBC2 and ITV could only broadcast normal programming for 7 hours a day from Mondays to Fridays, and 7.5 hours a day on Saturdays and Sundays.

Until 1957, television in the United Kingdom could not air from 6.00pm to 7.00pm. This was called the &quot;Toddlers&#x27; Truce&quot;, in which the idea was that parents could put their children to bed before primetime television would commence; this restriction was lifted in 1957. However, on Sundays, television remained off the air from 6.00pm to 7.00pm. This was in response to religious leaders&#x27; fears that television would interfere with people attending church services. In 1958, a compromise was reached, in which only religious programming could be aired during this time slot. The restriction was lifted in January 1972.

The Postmaster General allowed exemptions to the regulations. All schools programming, adult education, religious programming, state occasions, political broadcasts and Welsh language programming were totally exempt from the restrictions. Sport and outside broadcasting events were given a separate quota of broadcasting hours which could be used in a year, starting off at 200 hours a year in the mid 1950s, rising to a quota of 350 hours a year by the late 1960s. Broadcasting on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year&#x27;s Eve and New Year&#x27;s Day was also exempt from the tightly controlled restrictions.

The election of a Conservative government in June 1970 brought in changes to the control of broadcasting hours. At first, the typical broadcasting day was extended to 8 hours a day, with an increase in exemptions over Christmas, and an increase in the sport/outside broadcasting quota. On 19 January 1972, the then Minister for Posts and Telecommunications, Christopher Chataway, announced to the British House of Commons that all restrictions on broadcasting hours on television would be lifted from that day, with the broadcasters allowed to set their own broadcasting hours from then on. By November 1972, a full daytime schedule had been launched on ITV from 9.30am each day, with the BBC also expanding their schedules to include more daytime programming.

The UK Government previously appointed people to the BBC&#x27;s Board of Governors, a body responsible for the general direction of the organisation, and appointment of senior executives, but not its day-to-day management. From 2007, the BBC Trust replaced the Board of Governors. It is operationally independent of BBC management and external bodies, and aims to act in the best interests of licence fee payers.

Commercial television was first introduced in the United Kingdom in 1955. Unlike the US, there was a distinct split between advertisements and programming. Advertisers purely purchased spots within pre-defined breaks within programming, and had no connection to the programme content. The content and nature of adverts was strictly controlled by the ITA, the body controlling commercial television.

==== History of satellite television ====
The first commercial direct-broadcast satellite (DBS, also known as direct-to-home) service in the United Kingdom, Sky Television, was launched in 1989 and used the newly launched Astra satellite at 19.2° east, providing four analogue TV channels. The channels and subsequent VideoCrypt video encryption system used the existing PAL broadcast standard, unlike the winner of the UK state DBS licence, British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB).

In 1990, BSB launched, broadcasting five channels (Now, Galaxy, The Movie Channel, The Power Station and The Sports Channel) in D-MAC format and using the EuroCypher video encryption system which was derived from the General Instruments VideoCipher system used in the USA. One of the main selling points of the BSB offering was the Squarial, a flat plate antenna and low-noise block converter (LNB). Sky&#x27;s system used conventional and cheaper dish and LNB technology.

The two companies competed over the UK rights to movies. Sky operated from an industrial park in Isleworth in West London, whereas BSB had newly built offices in London (Marco Polo House). The two services subsequently merged to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). BSB&#x27;s D-MAC/EuroCypher system was gradually replaced with Sky&#x27;s VideoCrypt video encryption system.

In 1994, 17% of the group was floated on the London Stock Exchange (with ADRs listed on the New York Stock Exchange), and Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation owns a 35% stake.

By 1998, following the launch of several more satellites to Astra&#x27;s 19.2° east position, the number of channels had increased to around 60 and BSkyB launched the first subscription-based digital television platform in the UK, offering a range of 300 channels broadcast from Astra&#x27;s new satellite, at 28.2° east position under the brand name Sky Digital. BSkyB&#x27;s analogue service has now been discontinued, with all customers having been migrated to Sky Digital.

In May 2008, a free-to-air satellite service from the BBC and ITV was launched under the brand name Freesat, carrying a variety of channels from Astra 28.2°E, including some content in HD formats.

<text>George Clarence Brunies (February 6, 1902 – November 19, 1974), Georg Brunis, was an American jazz trombonist, who was part of the dixieland revival. He was known as &quot;The King of the Tailgate Trombone&quot;.

==Background==
Brunies was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, into a musical family. His father led a family band, and his brothers Henry, Merritt, Richard, and Albert (&quot;Abbie&quot;) all became noted professional musicians. By the age of eight, George was already playing alto horn professionally in Papa Jack Laine&#x27;s band. A few years later he switched to trombone. He played with many jazz, dance, and parade bands in New Orleans. He never learned to read music, but could quickly pick up tunes and invent a part for his instrument.

He first went to Chicago in 1919 with a band led by Ragbaby Stevens, then worked on riverboats going up and down the Mississippi River. In 1921, he returned to Chicago, and joined a band of his New Orleans friends playing at the Friar&#x27;s Inn; this was the band that became famous as the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. Brunies&#x27;s trombone style was influential to the young Chicago players, and his records were much copied.

After the Rhythm Kings broke up in Chicago in 1924, Brunies joined the nationally famous Ted Lewis band, which he played with through 1934.

After some time with Louis Prima&#x27;s band he landed a steady gig at the New York City jazz club, Nick&#x27;s, through 1938. In 1939, he joined Muggsy Spanier&#x27;s band, with whom he made some of his most famous recordings. The following year he returned to Nick&#x27;s, where he remained until 1946. Brunies then worked with Eddie Condon.

==Later career==
In 1949, Brunies moved back to Chicago to lead his own band. Brunies often showed off his unusual technical abilities and bizarre sense of humor at the same time; for example he would lie on the floor and invite the largest person in the audience to sit on his chest while he played trombone.

On the advice of a numerologist, he changed his name to Georg Brunis in the late 1940s, when he was playing at the 1111 (eleven-eleven) Club in Chicago. He believed that this name change would increase his good fortune. The 1111 was a popular jazz club which was always full on Friday and Saturday nights with jazz lovers from the northern suburbs of Chicago. Every now and then other well-known jazz musicians, such as Muggsy Spanier, would drop in and sit and play until dawn.

Georg Brunis died in Chicago on November 19, 1974.

<text>The Snowman is a 1982 British animated television film and symphonic poem based on Raymond Briggs&#x27;s 1978 picture book &quot;The Snowman.&quot; It was directed by Dianne Jackson for Channel 4. It was first shown on 26 December 1982, and was an immediate success. It was nominated for Best Animated Short Film at the 55th Academy Awards and won a BAFTA TV Award.

The story is told through pictures, action and music, scored by Howard Blake. It has no dialogue, with the exception of the central song, &quot;Walking in the Air&quot;. The orchestral score was performed by the Sinfonia of London and the song was performed by Peter Auty, a St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral choirboy.

The film ranked at number 71 on the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, based on a vote by industry professionals. It was voted number 4 in UKTV Gold&#x27;s &quot;Greatest TV Christmas Moments&quot;. It came third in Channel 4&#x27;s poll of &quot;100 Greatest Christmas Moments&quot; in 2004. Its broadcast, usually on Christmas Eve on Channel 4, has become an annual festive event in the UK.

A sequel, &quot;The Snowman and the Snowdog&quot;, was released in 2012.

==Plot==
In a rural area of Brighton, after a night of heavy snowfall on Christmas Eve, a young boy named James wakes up and plays in the snow, eventually building a large snowman. At the stroke of midnight, he puts on a coat and sneaks downstairs to find the snowman who magically comes to life. James shows the snowman around his house, playing with appliances, toys and other bric-a-brac, all while keeping quiet enough not to wake James&#x27; parents. The two find a sheeted-down motorcycle in the house&#x27;s garden and go for a ride on it through the woods. Its engine heat starts to melt the snowman and he cools off by luxuriating in the garage freezer.

Seeing a picture of the Arctic on a packet in the freezer, the snowman is agitated and takes matters into his own hands by taking James in his hand, running through the garden until they take flight, much to James&#x27; surprise. As &quot;Walking in the Air&quot; plays, James and the snowman fly over the South Downs towards the Channel coast, seeing the Royal Pavilion and Brighton Palace Pier, and north along the coast of Norway. They continue through an arctic landscape and into the aurora borealis. They land in a snow-covered forest in the North Pole where they join a party of snowmen and snowwomen. They eventually meet Father Christmas along with his reindeer; he gives James a card and a scarf with a snowman pattern. The snowman returns home with James before the sun rises and the two bid farewell for the night as the snowman returns to his original position and becomes lifeless again.

The following morning, James wakes up to find that the snowman has melted, leaving only his hat, scarf, coal eyes, tangerine nose, and coat buttons in a pile of melted snow. A saddened James finds his scarf, indicating the events really took place and were not a dream, as he kneels down by the snowman&#x27;s remains.

===Alternative introductions===
The original introduction on Channel 4 features Raymond Briggs walking through a field in rural Sussex describing his inspiration for the story, which then transitions into the animated landscape of the film (the idea being that he is doing so in character as an older version of James). The film&#x27;s executive producer Iain Harvey had received interest in the film from U.S. networks and for a VHS release. However, he noted that &quot;in the US programmes were sponsored, and to be sponsored you needed a big name&quot;. Various names such as Laurence Olivier and Julie Andrews were suggested, but a request for a rock star led to David Bowie being involved. He was a fan of Briggs&#x27;s story &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; and later provided a song for its animated adaptation. In the sequence, Bowie was filmed in the attic of &#x27;his&#x27; childhood home and discovering, in a drawer, a scarf closely resembling the one given to James towards the end of the film; he then proceeds to narrate over the opening with his own small variation of Briggs&#x27; monologue.

To celebrate the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Channel 4 created an alternative opening directed by Roger Mainwood, with Raymond Briggs&#x27;s interpretation of Father Christmas recounting how he met James, before giving his own variation on Briggs&#x27; monologue (including how the heavy snow left even him unable to fly) as he turns on his TV to watch the film, which the opening segues into. Comedian Mel Smith reprises the role in this opening. This version is also cropped to fit a 16:9 widescreen format. Channel 4 used this opening from 2002 until Mel Smith&#x27;s death in 2013, after which the Bowie opening was reinstated, which in turn returned the film to its original 4:3 aspect ratio.

==Production==
===Source book===

&quot;The Snowman&quot; is a wordless children&#x27;s picture book by Raymond Briggs, first published in 1978 by Hamish Hamilton in the United Kingdom, and published by Random House in the United States in November of the same year. In the United Kingdom, it was the runner-up for the Kate Greenaway Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book illustration by a British writer. In the United States, it was named to the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award list in 1979.

===Adaptation===
Iain Harvey, the film&#x27;s executive producer and publisher at Hamish Hamilton, recalls that the book had initially sold well, but a second print had been less successful with 50,000 unsold copies sitting in a warehouse, which he attributes to the lack of dialogue preventing it being read as a bedtime story. In 1980 he was contacted by producer John Coates from TVC (Television Cartoons) with an idea of adapting the book for an animated film, for which he gave his consent.

In March 1982, Coates presented an &quot;animatic&quot; storyboard version with a basic piano track by Howard Blake, including an early version of &quot;Walking in the Air&quot; to commissioning executives at the fledgeling Channel 4, a new public service television company which was due to begin broadcasting in November 1982. The director Dianne Jackson had worked with Coates on The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and had mainly worked on short animations and commercials; this was her first time directing a longer animated film. As a result, the experienced animator Jimmy T. Murakami was brought in to supervise. The film was produced using traditional animation techniques, consisting of pastels, crayons and other colouring tools drawn on pieces of celluloid, which were traced over hand drawn frames. For continuity purposes, the background artwork was painted using the same tools.

The story was expanded to fill 26 minutes and include a longer flying sequence which takes the boy to the North Pole and a party with Father Christmas which is not present in the picture book. The animators also brought in personal touches – a static sequence with a car is replaced by a motorcycle ride, as one of the animators was a keen motorcyclist and it was noted by Iain Harvey that this sequence kept &quot;the action flowing after all the fun and comedy of the boy and the Snowman exploring the house and forming a friendship – and what could be better than a midnight run in a snowy landscape&quot;. Similarly, although the boy in the book is unnamed, in the film he is named &quot;James&quot; on his present tag, added by animator Joanna Harrison as it was the name of her boyfriend (later her husband). Interviewed in 2012, Raymond Briggs recalls that he thought &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s a bit corny and twee, dragging in Christmas&#x27;, as &quot;The Snowman&quot; had nothing to do with that, but it worked extremely well.&quot;

The boy&#x27;s home appears to be located in the South Downs of England, near to Brighton; he and the snowman fly over the Royal Pavilion and Palace Pier. Raymond Briggs had lived in Sussex since 1961, and the composer Howard Blake was also a native of the county.

===Music===
The production team contacted Howard Blake early in the production, as they were having difficulties finding the right tone for adapting the wordless picture book. Blake suggested that the film should not feature dialogue, but instead a through-composed orchestral soundtrack. He recalls the song &quot;Walking in the Air&quot; was written some years earlier during a difficult period in his life, and the song formed the main theme for the work. In 2021, Blake told the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that he wanted to incorporate the lyrics with &quot;a symphony that expressed the complete innocence and beauty that we are all born with.&quot; Blake further brought up his religion, stating &quot;It felt as though the idea came from God.&quot;

Howard Blake&#x27;s orchestral score was performed in the film by the Sinfonia of London. The song &quot;Walking in the Air&quot; is sung in the film by chorister Peter Auty, who was not credited in the original version. He was given a credit on the 20th anniversary version.

In 1985, &quot;Walking in the Air&quot; was covered by chorister Aled Jones in a single which peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart. Jones is sometimes mistakenly credited with having sung the song in the film. Blake&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;The Snowman&quot; is often performed as a standalone concert work, often accompanying a projection of the film or sometimes with a narrator (the version for narrator was first performed by Bernard Cribbins in Summer 1983).

==Reception==
===Awards===
The film was nominated as Best Animated Short Film at the 55th Academy Awards in 1983, but lost to the Polish film Tango by Zbigniew Rybczyński. It won a BAFTA for best Children&#x27;s Programme (Entertainment/Drama) at the 1983 British Academy Television Awards, and was also nominated for Best Graphics. It won the Grand Prix at the Tampere Film Festival in Finland in 1984. It was named to the ALA Notable Children&#x27;s Videos list in 1982.

In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, based on a vote by industry professionals it was listed as #71. It was voted #4 in UKTV Gold&#x27;s &quot;Greatest TV Christmas Moments&quot;. It came third in Channel 4&#x27;s poll of &quot;100 Greatest Christmas Moments&quot; in 2004.

In a 2022 article, Stuart Heritage praised the film&#x27;s visuals and themes, particularly noting how the final sequence reflects Briggs&#x27; theme that life is fleeting.

==Home media==
&quot;The Snowman&quot; was originally released on VHS in 1982 by Palace Video. It has been re-released several times by Palace and later PolyGram Video, and Universal Studios Home Entertainment UK after Palace went out of business.

In 1993 it was released on VHS in the US by Columbia TriStar Home Video.

&quot;The Snowman&quot; was re-released in 2002 as a DVD special edition and again as a DVD and Blu-ray 30th anniversary edition in the United Kingdom on 5 November 2012 by Universal Studios Home Entertainment UK. The 2002 special edition peaked at No.3 in the video charts. The 2012 home video release includes four extra features: a &quot;Snow Business&quot; documentary, 
&quot;The Story of &quot;The Snowman&quot;&quot;, storyboard, and the introductions used throughout the film&#x27;s first 20 years. The film re-entered at No.14 on the UK Official children’s Video Chart on 11 November 2012, eventually peaking at No.5 on 16 December 2012 based on sales of DVDs and other physical formats.

The Universal DVD &quot;The Snowman &amp; Father Christmas&quot; (902 030 – 11), released in the United Kingdom in 2000, uses the Bowie opening.

==Subsequent media==
===&quot;The Snowman and the Snowdog&quot;===

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the original short and of Channel 4, a 25-minute special titled &quot;The Snowman and the Snowdog&quot; aired on Channel 4 on Christmas Eve 2012. Produced at the London-based animation company Lupus Films, with many of the original team returning, the sequel was made in the same traditional techniques as the first film, and features the Snowman, a new young boy named Billy and a snow dog flying over landmarks and going to another party.

The idea of a sequel had been resisted by Raymond Briggs for several years, but he gave his permission for the film in 2012. Howard Blake was one of the few crew members not asked to return; he was allegedly asked to &quot;send a demo&quot;, which he refused citing the success of the original score. The new film instead features the song &quot;Light the Night&quot; by former Razorlight drummer Andy Burrows and incidental music by Ilan Eshkeri.

The sequel was dedicated to the memory of producer John Coates, who died in September 2012, during its production.

===Stage version===
&quot;The Snowman&quot; has been made into a stage show. It was first produced by Contact Theatre, Manchester in 1986 and was adapted and produced by Anthony Clark. It had a full script and used Howard Blake&#x27;s music and lyrics. In 1993, Birmingham Repertory Company produced a version, with music and lyrics by Howard Blake, scenario by Blake, with Bill Alexander and choreography by Robert North.

Since 1997, Sadler&#x27;s Wells has presented it every year as the Christmas Show at the Peacock Theatre. As in the book and the film, there are no words, apart from the lyrics of the song &quot;Walking in the Air&quot;. The story is told through images and movement.

Special effects include the Snowman and boy flying high over the stage (with assistance of wires and harnesses) and &#x27;snow&#x27; falling in part of the auditorium. The production has had several revisions – the most extensive happening in 2000, when major changes were made to the second act, introducing new characters: A Beautiful Ice Princess and a villain called Jack Frost.

===Video game===
Quicksilva published an official video game in 1984, for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and MSX.

<doc id="182422" wikidata="Q709899" url="?curid=182422" title="Montagu Norman, 1st Baron Norman">
<text>Montagu Collet Norman, 1st Baron Norman DSO PC (6 September 1871 – 4 February 1950) was an English banker, best known for his role as the Governor of the Bank of England from 1920 to 1944.

Norman led the bank during the toughest period in modern British economic history and was noted for his somewhat raffish character and arty appearance. A very influential figure, Norman, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, was referred to as &quot;the currency dictator of Europe&quot;, a fact which he himself admitted to, before the Court of the Bank on 21 March 1930. The economist and Court member John Maynard Keynes said of him: &quot;Montagu Norman, always absolutely charming, always absolutely wrong&quot;.

==Early life and military service==
Norman was the elder son of Frederick Norman and Lina Susan Penelope Collet, a daughter of Sir Mark Wilks Collet, 1st Baronet, himself a Bank of England Governor. The Norman family was well known in banking. Montagu&#x27;s brother Ronald Collet Norman and his nephew Mark Norman became leading bankers. Montagu&#x27;s great-nephew David Norman has also led a successful City career and is a noted benefactor of the arts. Montagu Norman was educated at Eton and spent one year at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He also joined the 4th Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire militia in 1894 and served in the Second Boer War. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1901.

==Merchant banking==
After spending time in Europe, he joined Martins Bank in 1892; his father was a partner. In 1894 he joined Brown, Shipley &amp; Co., where his maternal grandfather was a partner and, in 1895, Brown Bros. &amp; Co. of New York. He became a partner at Brown Shipley in 1900 before leaving for South Africa. He retired from the bank in 1915.

==Bank of England==
He became a director of the Bank of England in 1907 and during World War I he was a financial advisor to government departments. He was appointed Deputy Governor in 1917 and he became Governor in 1920. He engineered the bank&#x27;s takeover of the Anglo-Austrian Bank in Vienna and the creation of the Anglo-Czechoslovak Bank in Prague. Under Norman, the bank underwent significant change. He was a supporter of the return to the gold standard, which he called &quot;knaveproof&quot;, in 1925, despite the opposition of economist John Maynard Keynes. In 1931, at the height of the Great Depression, Norman commented, &quot;Unless dramatic measures are taken to save it, the capitalist system throughout the civilized world will be wrecked within a year&quot;; he borrowed $250 million in an attempt to stave off speculative attacks upon the pound. Later that year, however, the United Kingdom was forced to permanently abandon the gold standard after the publication of the May Report on the UK&#x27;s budget deficit provoked a further financial crisis. Norman was returning from a cruise to Canada at the time, and did not learn the news until he docked in the UK.

Norman was a close friend of the German Central Bank President Hjalmar Schacht, who served in Hitler&#x27;s government as President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics between 1934 and 1937. Norman was also so close to the Schacht family that he was godfather to one of Schacht&#x27;s grandchildren. Both were members of the Anglo-German Fellowship and the Bank for International Settlements.

While in the past Norman&#x27;s role in the transferring of Czech gold to the Nazi regime in March 1939 was uncertain, careful investigation by historian David Blaazer into the Bank of England&#x27;s internal memos has established that Norman knowingly authorized the transfer of Czech gold from Czechoslovakia&#x27;s No. 2 account with the Bank for International Settlements to the No. 17 account, which Norman was aware was managed by the German Reichsbank. Within ten days the money had been transferred to other accounts. In autumn 1939, two months after the outbreak of World War II, Norman again supported transfers of Czech gold to Hitler&#x27;s Germany. On this occasion, the government intervened to block Norman&#x27;s initiative. He retired from the bank in 1944.

==Honours==
Following his retirement, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Norman, of St Clere in the County of Kent, on 13 October 1944. In addition to receiving the Distinguished Service Order, Norman was sworn of the Privy Council in 1923 and was created a Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown.

==Personal life==

On 2 November 1933, Norman married Priscilla Cecilia Maria Reyntiens, London councillor and granddaughter of Montagu Bertie, 7th Earl of Abingdon. He gained two stepsons from this marriage; Sir Simon Towneley and Sir Peregrine Worsthorne. Lord Norman &amp; Cecilia had no children and on his death he passed the bulk of his estate to his nephew, Brigadier Hugh Norman.

In 1944, while visiting his brother on his country estate in Hertfordshire, Norman went for a walk and tripped over, causing an injury from which he never recovered. There is an amusing anecdote contained in Bill Bryson&#x27;s book, that he tripped over a cow, but it is unclear where this anecdote came from as it is not known within his family.

From 1904, Norman&#x27;s London home was Thorpe Lodge, Airlie Gardens off Campden Hill in Kensington, which had been built c1816. Norman worked with Walter Knight Shirley and Ernest Gimson to modernise the house and redecorate it in the Arts and Crafts style. Lord Norman died at Thorpe Lodge in 1950 following a stroke. The house later became part of Holland Park School.

During his married life, he lived at the Manor of St Clere in Kemsing, Kent, which he acquired from his uncle in 1935.

<doc id="182426" wikidata="Q1188936" url="?curid=182426" title="Don Redman">
<text>Donald Matthew Redman (July 29, 1900 – November 30, 1964) was an American jazz musician, arranger, bandleader, and composer.

==Biography==
Redman was born in Piedmont, Mineral County, West Virginia, United States. His father was a music teacher, his mother was a singer. Beginning by playing the trumpet at the age of three, Redman joined his first band at the age of six and by the age of 12 was proficient on all wind instruments ranging from trumpet to oboe as well as piano. He studied at Storer College in Harper&#x27;s Ferry and at the Boston Conservatory, then joined Billy Page&#x27;s Broadway Syncopaters in New York City. He was the uncle of saxophonist Dewey Redman, and thus great-uncle of saxophonist Joshua Redman and trumpeter Carlos Redman.

===Career===
In 1923, Redman joined the Fletcher Henderson orchestra, mostly playing clarinet and saxophones.

He began writing arrangements, and Redman did much to formulate the sound that was to become swing. A trademark of Redman&#x27;s arrangements was the band playing harmony under written solos. He played brass and reed sections off each other in a call-response pattern, having one section punctuate the figures of another, and moved the melody around different orchestral sections and soloists. His use of this technique was sophisticated, highly innovative, and formed the basis of much big band jazz writing in the following decades.

In 1927, Jean Goldkette persuaded Redman to join McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers as their musical director and leader. He was responsible for their great success and arranged over half of their music (splitting the arranging duties with John Nesbitt through 1931).

===Don Redman and his Orchestra===
Redman formed his own band in 1931, gaining a residency at the Manhattan jazz club Connie&#x27;s Inn. Redman signed with Brunswick Records and undertook a series of radio broadcasts. Redman and his Orchestra also provided music for the animated short &quot;I Heard&quot;, part of the Betty Boop series produced by Fleischer Studios and distributed by Paramount. Redman composed original music for the short, which was released on September 1, 1933. The Brunswick records Redman made between 1931 and 1934 were some of the most complex pre-swing hot jazz arrangements of popular tunes. Redman&#x27;s band did not rely on just a driving rhythm or great soloists, but it had an overall level of arranging sophistication that was seldom heard by other bands of the period. The popular vocalist, Harlan Lattimore, provided about half of the vocals during this period. Redman himself was occasionally featured as vocalist, displaying a humorous, recitation-like vocal style on numbers such as &quot;Doin&#x27; What I Please&quot; and &quot;I Gotcha.&quot;

In 1933, his band made a Vitaphone short film for Warner Bros. (which is available as of 2006 on the DVD of the Busby Berkeley feature film &quot;Dames&quot;). Redman recorded for Brunswick through 1934. He then did a number of sides for ARC in 1936 (issued on their Vocalion, Perfect, Melotone, etc.) and in 1937, he pioneered a series of swing re-arrangements of old classic pop tunes for the Variety label. His use of a swinging vocal group (called &quot;The Swing Choir&quot;) was very modern and quite unusual with Redman&#x27;s sophisticated counterpoint melodies. He signed with Bluebird in 1938 and recorded with them until 1940, when he disbanded.

When Redman disbanded his orchestra, he concentrated on freelance work writing arrangements. Some of his arrangements became hits for Jimmy Dorsey, Count Basie, and Harry James. He traveled to Europe in 1946 leading an all-star band that included Don Byas, Tyree Glenn, and Billy Taylor. He appeared on &quot;Uptown Jubilee&quot; on the CBS Television network for the 1949 season. In the 1950s, he was music director for singer Pearl Bailey.

In the early 1960s, he played piano for the Georgia Minstrels Concert and soprano sax with Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle&#x27;s band.

==Death and posthumous tribute==
Don Redman died in New York City on November 30, 1964, aged 64, from undisclosed causes.

He was named a member of the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame on May 6, 2009.

<doc id="182427" wikidata="Q1260232" url="?curid=182427" title="Droop quota">
<text>In the study of electoral systems, the Droop quota (sometimes called the [[Droop quota|Hagenbach-Bischoff]], Britton, or Newland-Britton quota) is the minimum number of votes a party or candidate needs to receive in a district to guarantee they will win at least one seat.

The Droop quota is used to extend the concept of a majority to multiwinner elections, taking the place of the 50% bar in single-winner elections. Just as any candidate with more than half of all votes is guaranteed to be declared the winner in single-seat election, any candidate with more than a Droop quota&#x27;s worth of votes is guaranteed to win a seat in a multiwinner election.

Besides establishing winners, the Droop quota is used to define the number of excess votes, i.e. votes not needed by a candidate who has been declared elected. In proportional quota-based systems such as STV or expanding approvals, these excess votes can be transferred to other candidates to preventing them from being wasted.

The Droop quota was first suggested by the English lawyer and mathematician Henry Richmond Droop (1831–1884) as an alternative to the Hare quota.

Today, the Droop quota is used in almost all STV elections, including those in Australia, the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Malta. It is also used in South Africa to allocate seats by the largest remainder method.

Although common, the quota&#x27;s use in proportional representation has been criticized both for its bias toward large parties and for its ability to create no-show paradoxes, situations where a candidate or party loses a seat as a result of having won too &quot;many&quot; votes. This occurs regardless of whether the quota is used with largest remainders or STV.

== Definition ==

The exact value of the Droop quota for a formula_1-winner election is given by the expression:

formula_2

In the case of a single-winner election, this reduces to the familiar simple majority rule. Under such a rule, a candidate can be declared elected as soon as they have more than 50% of the vote, i.e. their vote total exceeds formula_3. A candidate who, at any point, holds strictly more than one Droop quota&#x27;s worth of votes is therefore guaranteed to win a seat.

Sometimes, the Droop quota is written as a share of all votes, in which case it has value . 

=== Original Droop quota ===
Modern variants of STV use fractional transfers of ballots to eliminate uncertainty. However, some older implementations of STV with whole vote reassignment cannot handle fractional quotas, and so instead will either round up, or add one and truncate:

formula_4

This variant of the quota is generally not recommended in the context of modern elections that allow for fractional votes, where it can cause problems in small elections (see below). However, it is the most commonly-used definition in legislative codes worldwide.

=== Derivation ===
The Droop quota can be derived by considering what would happen if candidates (here called &quot;Droop winners&quot;) have exceeded the Droop quota. The goal is to identify whether an outside candidate could defeat any of these candidates. In this situation, if each quota winner&#x27;s share of the vote equals , while all unelected candidates&#x27; share of the vote, taken together, is at most votes. Thus, even if there were only one unelected candidate who held all the remaining votes, they would not be able to defeat any of the Droop winners.

==Example in STV==
The following election has 3 seats to be filled by single transferable vote. There are 4 candidates: George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and Aaron Burr. There are 102 voters, but two of the votes are spoiled.

The total number of valid votes is 100, and there are 3 seats. The Droop quota is therefore formula_5. These votes are as follows:

First preferences for each candidate are tallied:
* Washington: 45 
* Hamilton: 10
* Burr: 20
* Jefferson: 25

Only Washington has strictly more than 25 votes. As a result, he is immediately elected. Washington has 20 excess votes that can be transferred to their second choice, Hamilton. The tallies therefore become:
* Washington: 25 
* Hamilton: 30
* Burr: 20
* Jefferson: 25

Hamilton is elected, so his excess votes are redistributed. Thanks to Hamilton&#x27;s support, Jefferson receives 30 votes to Burr&#x27;s 20 and is elected.

If all of Hamilton&#x27;s supporters had instead backed Burr, the election for the last seat would have been exactly tied, requiring a tiebreaker; generally, ties are broken by taking the limit of the results as the quota approaches the exact Droop quota.

== Common errors ==
There is a great deal of confusion among legislators and political observers about the correct form of the Droop quota. At least six different versions appear in various legal codes or definitions of the quota, all varying by one vote. The ERS handbook on STV has advised against such variants since at least 1976, as they can cause problems with proportionality in small elections. In addition, it means that vote totals cannot be summarized into percentages, because the winning candidate may depend on the choice of unit or total number of ballots (not just their distribution across candidates). Common variants of the Droop quota include:

formula_6

A quota being &quot;inadmissable&quot; refers to the possibility that more will achieve quota than the number of open seats. However preventing such an occurrence is not necessary. The archaic rounded-off form of the Droop quota (votes/seats+1, plus 1, rounded down) was traditionally seen as needed in the context of modern fractional transfer systems, and it was believed that any smaller portion of the votes, such as exact Droop, would not work because it would be possible for one more candidate than there are winners to reach the quota. s Newland and Britton noted in 1974, this is not a problem: if the last two winners both receive a Droop quota of votes, rules can be applied to break the tie, and ties can occur regardless of which quota is used. Due to this misunderstanding, Ireland, Malta and Australia have used Droop&#x27;s original quota - votes/seats+1, plus 1 - for the last hundred years.

The two variants in the first line come from Droop&#x27;s discussion in the context of Hare&#x27;s STV proposal. Hare assumed that to calculate election results, physical ballots would be reshuffled across piles, and did not consider the possibility of fractional votes. In such a situation, rounding the number of votes up (or, alternatively, adding one and rounding down) introduces as little error as possible, while maintaining the admissibility of the quota, by ensuring that no more can achieve quota than just the number of seats available.

=== Confusion with the Hare quota ===
The Droop quota is often confused with the more intuitive Hare quota. While the Droop quota gives the number of voters needed to mathematically guarantee a candidate&#x27;s election, the Hare quota gives the number of voters represented by each winner in an exactly-proportional system (i.e. one where each voter is represented equally).

The confusion between the two quotas originates from a fencepost error, caused by forgetting unelected candidates can also have votes at the end of the counting process. In the case of a single-winner election, misapplying the Hare quota would lead to the incorrect conclusion that a candidate must receive 100% of the vote to be certain of victory; in reality, any votes exceeding a bare majority are excess votes.

==Comparison with Hare==

The Hare quota gives more proportional outcomes on average because it is statistically unbiased. By contrast, the Droop quota is more biased towards large parties than any other admissible quota. As a result, the Droop quota is the quota most likely to produce minority rule by a plurality party, where a party representing less than half of the voters may take majority of seats in a constituency. However, the Droop quota has the advantage that any party receiving more than half the votes will receive at least half of all seats.

<doc id="182430" wikidata="Q4919977" url="?curid=182430" title="Bjørnson Festival">
<text>Bjørnson Festival (&quot;Bjørnsonfestivalen&quot;) is an international literary festival held annually during August / September in Molde and Nesset, Norway.

The event is named in honor of the Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson who was raised in the area. The prime objective of the festival is to promote interest in literature and writing. The festival offers a program of seminars, art exhibitions and writing courses.

In parallel with the festival in Molde, festival events are held at Nesset Parsonage near Eidsvåg. This was Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson&#x27;s childhood home. His father Peder Bjørnson was parish priest in Nesset from 1837 to 1853.

The Peace Grove &quot;(Fredslunden&quot;) is located next to the Royal Birch (&quot;Kongebjørka&quot;) in Molde. It was founded by author and poet Knut Ødegård, president of the Bjornson festival in 1997. The Peace Grove stands as a reminder of the international struggle for freedom, peace and human dignity. Among those who have planted trees in the Peace Grove are visiting authors including Wole Soyinka, Yasar Kemal, Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, Seamus Heaney, Amos Oz, Bei Dao, Hans Blix Qiu Xiaolong and Thor Heyerdahl.

<doc id="182432" wikidata="Q1543022" url="?curid=182432" title="Stardust (1927 song)">
<text>&quot;Stardust&quot; is a 1927 song composed by Hoagy Carmichael, with lyrics later added by Mitchell Parish. It has been recorded as an instrumental or vocal track over 1,500 times. Carmichael developed a taste for jazz while attending Indiana University. He formed his own band and played at local events in Indiana and Ohio. Following his graduation, Carmichael moved to Florida to work for a law firm. He left the law sector and returned to Indiana, after learning of the success of one of his compositions. In 1927, after leaving a local university hangout, Carmichael started to whistle a tune that he later developed further. When composing the song, he was inspired by the end of one of his love affairs, and on the suggestion of a university classmate, he decided on its title. The same year, Carmichael recorded an instrumental version of the song for Gennett Records.

In 1928, Carmichael left Indiana after Mills Music hired him as a composer. Mills Music then assigned Mitchell Parish to add words to the song. Don Redman recorded the song in the same year, and by 1929 it was performed regularly at the Cotton Club. Isham Jones&#x27;s 1930 rendition of the song made it popular on radio, and soon multiple acts had recorded &quot;Stardust&quot;. Because of the song&#x27;s popularity, by 1936, RCA Victor pressed a double-sided version that featured Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman on respective sides.

By 1940 the song was considered a standard, and it was later included in the Great American Songbook. That year, RCA Victor released two more recordings of &quot;Stardust&quot;: one by Dorsey featuring Frank Sinatra as the singer, and one by Artie Shaw. Shaw&#x27;s recording sold one million copies, and Glenn Miller&#x27;s rendition was published in the same year. Artists including Jo Stafford, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Billy Ward and his Dominoes, Ringo Starr, and Willie Nelson have recorded &quot;Stardust&quot;. The song was featured in several films, including &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;, &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, and &quot;Casino&quot;. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1995 and added to the National Recording Registry in 2004.

==Background==
Soon after entering Indiana University, Carmichael developed a taste for jazz music. He had learned to play the piano with his mother, who performed at dances and movie theaters. In 1922, Carmichael met and befriended Bix Beiderbecke. Carmichael often played with Beiderbecke, and he became acquainted with his band, the Wolverines, who recorded his original composition &quot;Riverboat Shuffle&quot; in 1924. While still attending Indiana University, the singer formed a band called Carmichael&#x27;s Collegians. Carmichael and his band performed locally in Indiana and around Ohio. The band appeared at 50 events between 1924 and 1925, while between 1925 and 1926, they played three to five nights a week at different engagements. Carmichael received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1925 and had earned a Bachelor of Laws by 1926. In the same year he worked as a law clerk in Miami, but he returned to Indiana after failing the Florida Bar examination. However, he passed the Indiana State Bar Association examination and worked for a law firm in that state. With the success of Red Nichols&#x27; 1927 recording of Carmichael&#x27;s original &quot;Washboard Blues&quot;, the composer decided to leave the practice of law in pursuit of a career in music.

==Composition, first recording and addition of lyrics==

Carmichael wrote the song with inspiration from the end of his love affair with Kathryn Moore, who would later marry Art Baker, the trumpet player in Carmichael&#x27;s Collegians. While Carmichael related several explanations of how he was inspired to write it on the University campus, biographer Richard Sudhalter deemed the stories &quot;encrusted in myth, much of it the composer&#x27;s own creation&quot;. One night after leaving the Book Nook, a university hangout, Carmichael whistled what would become the opening of the song. The composer later declared that he felt that the tune &quot;had something very strange and different&quot;. He worked on the details with different pianos, including one at the Book Nook. According to Ernie Pyle, the composer did further work at the Carmichael family&#x27;s home. While he visited Carmichael, Pyle asked him to play the song he had been working on. Pyle later commented that Carmichael asked him not to reveal the details of the night he worked on the song with the family&#x27;s piano, saying &quot;the public likes to think these sweet songs are conceived under the moonlight, amid roses and soft breezes&quot;. Carmichael finished the details of the composition on a grand piano that was later thrown away because of its poor state. Baker and Carmichael&#x27;s Collegians&#x27; singer Violet Deckard Gardner remembered Carmichael humming the tune of the incomplete composition before 1926. Fellow student Stuart Gorrell suggested the title &quot;Star Dust&quot;; Gorrell felt the tune sounded like &quot;dust from stars drifting down through the summer sky&quot;.

=== Recording ===
After working out the details with the band, Carmichael booked a recording session with Gennett Records for October 31, 1927. Since he had not written any sheet music for the song, he had to whistle the tune to the musicians. Carmichael played the piano, backed by Emil Seidel and his orchestra: Byron Smart (trumpet), Oscar Rossberg (trombone), Dick Kent and Gene Wood (alto saxophones), Maurice Bennett (tenor saxophone), Don Kimmel (guitar), Paul Brown (tuba), Cliff Williams (drums). The session took place at Gennett&#x27;s studio in Richmond, Indiana. The recording featured a &quot;medium fast and jazzy tempo&quot; with no lyrics. Under the single-word title &quot;Stardust,&quot; it was placed on the flipside of &quot;One Night In Havana&quot;, assigned the release number 6311, and credited to Hoagy Carmichael and His Pals.
Carmichael received a one-sided pressing of &quot;Stardust&quot; from the studio, before he left Indiana in 1928 to work for Mills Music as a composer. The first manuscript for the song was deposited at the United States Copyright Office on January 5, 1928. The sheet music featured a tune in a key of D with no indication of tempo and no lyrics. Mills Music then published different sheet music for the song on January 19, 1929, as a piano composition. Don Redman, who worked for Mills Music, often played the song. After hearing Redman&#x27;s rendition of it, a company arranger suggested playing the song at a &quot;slower tempo and in a sentimental style&quot;. Feeling it could be a potential success, Irving Mills &quot;decided on the song having lyrics added.

=== Lyrics ===
Mills assigned lyricist Mitchell Parish to add the words to Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;Star Dust&quot;. Parish used as a working title &quot;Then I Will Be Satisfied&quot;, but he accepted Redman&#x27;s suggestion to re-title the song to &quot;Stardust&quot;. Author Gene Fernett suggested Redman wrote the verse of the song, but his claim could not be supported. Parish wrote the song using Carmichael&#x27;s account of how he was inspired to compose the melody, while the lyricist developed a story focused in the concept of lost love. The sheet music for the vocal composition was published as &quot;Star Dust&quot; on May 10, 1929 in the key of C major.

=== Analysis ===
The song&#x27;s structure has two introductory verses that are sometimes omitted. These are followed by a 32-bar chorus in ABAC form (instead of the traditional AABA form) that is often repeated. The intriguing opening harmonic progression of the chorus starts on the IV chord for two bars which then changes from major to minor, a method also used by two contemporary songs: &quot;After You’ve Gone&quot; (1918) and &quot;I’ll See You In My Dreams&quot; (1924).

The melody fluctuates between minor and major third intervals in range of an octave and a third to &quot;heighten drama&quot;.

==Early recordings==
In early 1929, Redman and his band The Chocolate Dandies released &quot;Star Dust&quot; on Okeh 8668. The recording retained Carmichael&#x27;s original key of D. The song soon circulated among black musicians and jazz interpreters, and it was often performed at the Cotton Club after being introduced in 1929. Duke Ellington performed the song at the club. The revue &quot;Hot Chocolates&quot; featured a version by Louis Armstrong, which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2009.

While Carmichael worked for RCA Records as a session jazz ensemble leader, journalist Walter Winchell promoted the song. His writings attracted the attention of Isham Jones, who recorded a version with his orchestra as a slow ballad. Jones&#x27;s session took place on May 14, 1930, in Chicago, and Brunswick Records released it under catalog number 4856, with the title once again &quot;Stardust.&quot; The 1931 release became one of his most popular recordings. By 1931, &quot;Stardust&quot; was often played by the orchestras of several US radio stations. While remarking on the popularity of the tune on the radio, the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; opined of Jones&#x27;s version: &quot;This beautiful melody seems destined to achieve the popularity which it so richly deserves and which is so long overdue.&quot; In August 1931, Bing Crosby released the song as &quot;Star Dust&quot; on Brunswick Records. The same year, Lee Sims also released &quot;Stardust&quot; on Brunswick 6132, a version that the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; called &quot;a melody of a considerable intensity and with dramatic outbursts,&quot; with a &quot;realistic and very full&quot; piano reproduction. Throughout the 1930s, record labels used both the one and two-word versions of the title, though Carmichael himself favored the one-word title, as evidenced by his private correspondence and his 1946 memoir &quot;The Stardust Road.&quot;

==Big band era and success==
By 1935, while radio announcers commonly credited the orchestra only, Carmichael was mentioned as the composer of the song during introductions because of its popularity. The same year, saxophonist Coleman Hawkins recorded the song on March 2 in Paris. Compagnie de Gramophone Française released it with the catalog number K-7527. The song was often performed by Art Tatum, Garnet Clark, and Fats Waller. Mills recorded the song himself with his multiple bands, and recorded versions by the Mills Blue Rhythm Band and Cab Calloway. In 1936, for the first time in its history, RCA Records pressed two versions of the same song by two different artists on a single record: Tommy Dorsey on one side and Benny Goodman on the other. Goodman used an arrangement by Fletcher Henderson, while Dorsey&#x27;s version featured the vocals of Edythe Wright. By 1937, Goodman remarked that Carmichael&#x27;s tune was the most popular dance number of his repertoire. &quot;Stardust&quot; became a standard of big band music.
In 1940, RCA Victor executive Harry Myerson proposed that the label again release a two-sided recording of &quot;Stardust&quot;: one side would feature Artie Shaw, the other a new version by Dorsey. Shaw and Dorsey&#x27;s versions were ultimately released on separate records. Dorsey&#x27;s recording of the song featured vocals by Frank Sinatra and the Pied Pipers, while Shaw&#x27;s release would become the most popular recording by the clarinetist, selling a million copies. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; celebrated the release of both recordings in the same week. It considered Dorsey&#x27;s version &quot;emotional&quot;, and felt the vocals by Sinatra and the Pied Pipers made the record suitable for &quot;armchair listening&quot;. Of Shaw&#x27;s version, the reviewer remarked on his &quot;fluid clarinet above strings&quot;, and determined the record is for &quot;straight dancing&quot;. The &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; welcomed Dorsey&#x27;s &quot;silky trombone&quot; and the &quot;slow vocal style&quot; of Sinatra and the Pied Pipers. Of Shaw&#x27;s version, they stressed his &quot;intricate and dazzling clarinet wizardry&quot;, and the &quot;medium slow drag&quot; playing style of the band. The &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; also remarked on the &quot;intricate clarinet work&quot; by Shaw, while it felt that Dorsey&#x27;s version featured &quot;expert trombone work&quot; and an &quot;unusual vocal&quot; that the reviewer preferred over Shaw&#x27;s version. Shaw&#x27;s recording was arranged by Lennie Hayton, while the clarinetist used his new orchestra composed of: Billy Butterfield (trumpet), Jerry Jerome (tenor saxophone), Johnny Guarnieri (piano), Nick Fatool (drums), and Jack Jenney and Vernon Brown (trombones). Hayton&#x27;s arrangements included solos by Shaw, Butterfield and Jenney, while they were focused on the use of the string section.
Also in 1940, Glenn Miller recorded his version of the song, which entered &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; National Best Selling Chart on October 26, and peaked at number 20. &quot;DownBeat&quot;″s review considered the release &quot;among the greatest bits of big band scoring in history&quot;. While it considered the song &quot;beautifully arranged with good sax and trumpet solos&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; felt the result is &quot;completely dead and lifeless&quot;. The publication attributed this to an imbalance in the number of musicians in the woodwind section, compared to the rhythm section, which the reviewer described as &quot;just competent musicians, no more&quot;.

In 1940, the tune was among those affected by the ASCAP boycott. The dispute between the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and radio broadcasters focused on the increase in the price of song royalties. To counter the use of ASCAP tunes including &quot;Stardust&quot;, Broadcast Music, Inc. was created, and the broadcasters did not renew their contract for the use of an estimated two million tunes. After nine months of negotiation, a settlement was reached in October 1941 and major networks aired the tunes again. In 1941, Don Byas recorded a version of &quot;Stardust&quot; featuring Thelonious Monk, as he was the house pianist at Minton&#x27;s Playhouse. Monk disliked &quot;Stardust&quot;: he described it as &quot;a sad song ... if you know anything about music and harmony&quot;. He felt the melody was &quot;lousy&quot; and that performers have to &quot;do a lot of figuring how to play that in order to make it sound good&quot;. Another version by Miller was released on the V-Disc label in 1943. During the 1940s, &quot;Stardust&quot; was recorded by multiple artists either as an instrumental song or as a romantic ballad by vocalists. For the period from July 1947 to July 1948, &quot;Stardust&quot; placed at number one on the Juke Box Standard Favorites poll &quot;Billboard&quot; conducted through juke box operators and using the Peatman Survey for radio audiences. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, it &quot;proved to be a nationwide favorite, drawing top votes from all parts of the country&quot;.

==Later recordings==
In May 1953, according to jukebox operators, &quot;Stardust&quot; placed three times on the Ten Pop Standard Records list. Shaw&#x27;s version topped the chart, while Dorsey and Miller&#x27;s versions placed at numbers seven and eight, respectively. Ella Fitzgerald recorded the song, accompanied by Ellis Larkins on the piano. The tune was included on her 1954 album &quot;Songs in a Mellow Mood&quot;. &quot;Saturday Review&quot; described Fitzgerald as doing &quot;absorbing things with &#x27;Stardust″&quot;, while the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; considered the tune &quot;completely in line with her magnificent singing&quot;. In 1954, when the copyright of 14 of his songs including &quot;Stardust&quot; was due for renewal, Carmichael sued Mills Music to receive total ownership or co-ownership of the compositions. Carmichael&#x27;s contract with Mills Music granted the songwriter royalties in case any of his songs were published. He started his legal action on the grounds of &quot;unconscionable advantage taken of him at the time the contracts were executed&quot;. Summary judgment was denied, as the court considered that &quot;the assignee paid large royalties&quot;. In 1955, during the 25th anniversary of its publishing, &quot;Time&quot; estimated that Carmichael received a total of $250,000 in royalties for &quot;Stardust&quot;, while the song made at the time $15,000 to $20,000 a year.

Producer Lee Gillette convinced Nat King Cole to include the song on his 1957 release &quot;Love Is the Thing&quot;. Cole initially refused to record it because of the number of renditions available at the time. Cole, who had been singing the song since 1954, declared: &quot;I hate to sing Stardust, it wears me out&quot;. On its release, the song received good airplay. In 1957, Billy Ward and his Dominoes&#x27; version placed at number 12 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top 100. The same year, Pat Boone released a version on his album &quot;Star Dust&quot;, which reached number two on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Best selling LP&#x27;s chart. Saxophonist John Coltrane recorded a ballad version in 1958 in what was later known as the &quot;Stardust Sessions&quot;, later released as the title track of his 1963 Stardust album. Sinatra&#x27;s 1962 &quot;Sinatra and Strings&quot; album arranger Don Costa omitted Stardust&#x27;s chorus, to instead focus the &quot;musical and lyrical mind on all the neglected nuances of the verse&quot;. A review in &quot;The Rock Island Argus&quot; called Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Stardust&quot; his &quot;choicest&quot; track on the album and remarked on his &quot;entirely new approach overlooking the perennially favored chorus&quot;.

Between 1958 and 1963, &quot;Stardust&quot; produced US$50,000 yearly in royalties for Mills Music. In 1964, Nino Tempo &amp; April Stevens&#x27; version peaked at number 32 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top 100 and number 27 in Canada. Ringo Starr recorded the song featuring arrangements by Paul McCartney for his 1970 debut solo album, &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;. In 1978, Willie Nelson recorded it as the title-track of his album of pop standards. In its review, the Gannett News Service felt that &quot;Carmichael would be proud&quot;. Nelson&#x27;s album topped &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Country Albums, while reaching the summit on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes. &quot;Stardust&quot; remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for 540 weeks until 1988. Of Nelson&#x27;s version of &quot;Stardust&quot;, National Public Radio commented: &quot;Today, people who never heard of Isham Jones or Artie Shaw or even composer Hoagy Carmichael know his work thanks to Willie Nelson.&quot; Tiny Tim recorded the song with Brave Combo on what would be his final recording, the 1996 album &quot;Girl&quot;. Rod Stewart included the song on &quot;&quot; in 2004. In 2017, Bob Dylan recorded it for his three-disc set &quot;Triplicate&quot;, that covered American standards. Daniel Kreps of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; considered that &quot;Dylan&#x27;s approach finds a pleasing, country-tinged arrangement&quot; that the reviewer noted to be &quot;somewhere between&quot; Sinatra and Nelson&#x27;s version.

==Legacy==
&quot;Stardust&quot; is considered a part of the Great American Songbook. The song has been recorded over 1,500 times, and has been translated into 40 languages. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; has defined it as &quot;one of the most renowned and most recorded standards in all of American music&quot;. Carmichael&#x27;s 1927 version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1995. The 1940 recording of the song by Artie Shaw And His Orchestra was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1988. National Public Radio included it on their NPR 100, a 1999 list of the 100 most important American musical works of the 20th century. For NPR, Susan Stamberg defined it as &quot;an American song of longing, dreams, desires, [that] still stretches across the decades to touch the spirit of anyone who hears it&quot;. In 2004, the Library of Congress inducted Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;Stardust&quot; into the National Recording Registry, which lists &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically important&quot; music that &quot;informs or reflects life&quot; in the United States. Carmichael&#x27;s entry to the Songwriters Hall of Fame deemed the song &quot;most notably one of the greatest standards&quot; from the Jazz Age. Carmichael&#x27;s biographer Richard Sudhalter attributed the song&#x27;s popularity to &quot;some combination of young Carmichael&#x27;s heartland upbringing, Bix&#x27;s uniquely bardic sensibility, and the unself-conscious emotional directness that characterizes much non-urban American pop music&quot;. Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Stardust&quot; album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2015.

===In popular culture===
In 1938, Orson Welles&#x27;s radio broadcast &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; featured an excerpt of &quot;Stardust&quot; played by the fictional Ramón Raquello Orchestra. The 1961 episode &quot;The Hit Songwriters&quot; of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; featured a version by Fred Flintstone. Different versions of the song appeared in films, including &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (1980), &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990), 
&quot;Another Man&#x27;s Poison&quot; (1951),
&quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), &quot;Casino&quot; (1995), &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004), &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (2018), &quot;Captive State (2019)&quot;., and Carmichael&#x27;s own short 1942 recording is featured at the start of closing credits in &quot;Nightmare Alley (2021)&quot;. On YouTube that 1942 recording has garnered nearly 230,000 views of one posting alone.

On December 1, 2000, Nelson&#x27;s version of &quot;Stardust&quot; was used to wake up the crew of Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s mission STS-108. The Caretaker sampled versions of the song for 2 of his albums; Marjorie Stedeford&#x27;s version in &quot;We&#x27;ll All Go Riding on a Rainbow&quot; and Charlie Spivak&#x27;s version in &quot;Everywhere at the End of Time&quot;.

<doc id="182433" wikidata="Q1166201" url="?curid=182433" title="Stardust (Neil Gaiman novel)">
<text>Stardust is a 1999 fantasy novel by British writer Neil Gaiman, usually published with illustrations by Charles Vess. &quot;Stardust&quot; has a different tone and style from most of Gaiman&#x27;s prose fiction, being consciously written in the tradition of pre-Tolkien English fantasy, following in the footsteps of authors such as Lord Dunsany and Hope Mirrlees. It is concerned with the adventures of a young man from the village of Wall, which borders the magical land of Faerie.

In 2007, a film based on the novel was released to generally positive reviews. Gaiman has also occasionally made references to writing a sequel, or at least another book concerning the village of Wall.

The story begins in late April 1839, as John William Draper had just photographed the Moon and Charles Dickens was serialising &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. The majority of the book takes place seventeen years later, starting around October 1856.

== Main characters ==
* Tristran Thorn: The book&#x27;s main character (renamed &quot;Tristan&quot; in the movie adaptation), a half-Faerie, half-human boy raised by his father Dunstan Thorn and stepmother Daisy, whom he believes to be his mother. Tristran foolishly promises to retrieve a fallen star for the girl he wants to be his sweetheart, Victoria, and so unexpectedly finds the beautiful Yvaine.
* Yvaine: A fallen star, which Tristran vows to find and bring to Victoria Forester. In Faerie, stars are living creatures. Yvaine appears to be immortal, but not invulnerable. She is pursued by the Lilim and the surviving sons of the Lord of Stormhold, who want her for their own reasons. When Tristran realises his love for her, he abandons his courtship of Victoria Forester, and Yvaine marries him despite their inability to have children.
* Dunstan Thorn: Tristran&#x27;s father. Main character in the beginning of the book. He visited the Wall Market to find a gift for his sweetheart Daisy Hempstock, and ended up fathering Tristran by Madame Semele&#x27;s abused slave Faerie girl, Lady Una. Prior to this, he had bought a crystal snowdrop from this girl, and later gives the flower to Tristran. He is married to Daisy, who is the mother of Tristran&#x27;s half-sister Louisa.
* Victoria Forester: A resident of Wall described as &quot;the most beautiful girl for a hundred miles around&quot;. She is the daughter of Bridget Comfrey and Tommy Forester. Although Tristran is infatuated with her, she does not return his feelings and does not take his promise to bring her the fallen star seriously at first. She ultimately marries a man called Monday and thereby unwittingly frees Tristran&#x27;s mother, Lady Una, from slavery.
* The Lord of Stormhold: The eighty-first Lord of Stormhold is an old man who rules Stormhold until his death. At the beginning of &quot;Stardust&quot;, he has four dead sons (Secundus, Quartus, Quintus, and Sextus) and three living ones (Primus, Tertius, and Septimus), in addition to his long-lost daughter Una. The sons are imaginatively named, in Latin, Second, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth (all dead) and First, Third and Seventh (living). Daughter Una is named for a feminine form of the Latin unum, meaning one. The dead sons appear as ghostly observers, while the living sons constantly plot to kill each other to succeed their father as Lord of Stormhold.
* Lord Septimus: The youngest and most ruthless of the Lords of Stormhold. He is, by nature, a skilled assassin and has succeeded in murdering the majority of his family.
* Lord Primus: The oldest of the Lords of Stormhold. In comparison with his brothers, he is benevolent, compassionate and reasonable.
* Una: A cat-eared faerie girl of great beauty who works as a slave for Madame Semele until released by an improbable occurrence that fulfills the conditions of her debt. Una suffers constant abuse at the hands of Madame Semele, being beaten and called a &quot;slattern&quot;. When not toiling for the witch-woman, she is kept in the form of a multicoloured bird chained by a silver thread to a Vardo. She is later revealed to be the Lady Una, only daughter of the Lord of Stormhold, and Tristran&#x27;s birth mother.
* Madame Semele/Ditchwater Sal: A witch, and a member of the Sisterhood to which the Lilim belong. The witch-queen knew Semele as Ditchwater Sal when she was &quot;a young chit of a thing&quot;. On their first encounter, Semele drugs the witch-queen&#x27;s food with a magical substance that causes her to speak only the truth, thus forcing her to blurt out the truth of the fallen star. Semele plots to find the star first and restore her own youth, but the witch-queen curses her so that she will never perceive the star in any way.
* The Lilim: Three old women of great power. The eldest of the three is called &quot;The Witch-Queen&quot;, though they are also called by this title collectively. They are never named, as they lost their names long ago, but the eldest adopts the alias &quot;Morwanneg&quot; at one point. The Lilim were once the beautiful queens of a magical kingdom of witches; when it was lost beneath the sea, centuries of age caught up with them. They seek the fallen star because, by consuming her heart, they will be granted centuries of youth and beauty. Using magic counteracts the effect; therefore with each spell cast by the witch-queen, she grows older and uglier. In the movie adaptation, they are named Lamia, Mormo, and Empusa, but none of their backstory is included.

==Plot==
Every nine years, in the village of Wall in rural England, a market is held on the other side of a stone wall dividing the realm of Faerie from our world. In the early Victorian era, young Dunstan Thorn meets Una, a fairy enslaved by the witch Semele, at the market. Dunstan purchases a glass snowdrop from her with a kiss and, later that night, has sex with her in the woods. Months later, Dunstan receives a baby in a basket—his and Una&#x27;s son, Tristran.

Eighteen years later, Tristran is infatuated with someone named Victoria Forester. In Faerie, the dying Lord of the castle of Stormhold throws his pendant out the window, declaring that the first of his three surviving sons—Primus, Tertius, and Septimus—to retrieve it will be his successor. The pendant flies upward and knocks a star out of the sky. While walking Victoria home, Tristan sees a falling star land in Faerie and vows to bring it to her. Victoria agrees to reward him with whatever he desires—including her hand in marriage—if he succeeds. Dunstan gives Tristran the snowdrop and enables him to pass the wall&#x27;s guards by alluding to his fairy heritage.

Primus, Tertius and Septimus start searching for the pendant after their father&#x27;s death. Septimus poisons Tertius at an inn. Meanwhile, the Lilim, a trio of ancient witches, learn of the fallen star and plan to eat its heart to regain their youth. The eldest of the Lilim, the witch-queen, is chosen to find the star and consumes the remains of their last star&#x27;s heart.

Tristran meets a small man who gives him a silver chain, and a magic candle-stub which allows one to travel great distances quickly while it burns. Tristran uses the candle to reach the star, which turns out to be a young woman named Yvaine. Resolving to take her to Victoria, Tristran tethers Yvaine to him with the chain; however, the candle burns out before he can return. Tristran and Yvaine travel on foot. Yvaine escapes on a unicorn when Tristran unchains her and leaves in search of food. Meanwhile, the witch-queen encounters Semele, who deceives her into disclosing what her mission is. The enraged witch-queen puts a curse on her, which prevents her from seeing, touching or perceiving the star.

After discovering that Yvaine is gone, Tristran catches a ride in Primus&#x27;s carriage. The witch-queen conjures a wayside inn to catch Yvaine, who is approaching. Yvaine arrives at the inn, followed by Tristran and Primus. The witch-queen attempts to poison Tristran but the unicorn warns him in time. He returns to the inn as the witch-queen murders Primus. Tristran escapes with Yvaine by forming another candle from the remnants of the magic candle. Septimus later arrives and finds Primus&#x27; body. He sets off looking for the witch-queen, now obligated to avenge Primus. Tristran and Yvaine end up stranded on a cloud miles above Faerie when the candle burns out but are rescued by the crew of a flying ship. There, Tristran expresses that he no longer intends to force Yvaine to accompany him. However, by the custom of her kind, because he has saved her life, she is nonetheless obliged to do so.

Upon parting company with the ship, Tristran and Yvaine set off for Wall. They encounter the cursed Semele. Unable to see Yvaine, Semele agrees to transport Tristran the rest of the way to Wall. Tristran obtains a promise from her that he will arrive there unharmed. This, however, does not prevent Semele using the snowdrop to transform him into a dormouse for the duration of the journey. Yvaine also rides in Semele&#x27;s caravan, unbeknownst to Semele. Septimus, meanwhile, plots his attack on the witch-queen, who eventually kills him.

At the market, Tristran leaves Yvaine and crosses back into Wall to meet Victoria. Meanwhile, Yvaine realizes she has fallen in love with Tristran but learns that if she crosses the wall and leaves Faerie, she will be transformed into a piece of rock. A dismayed Victoria informs Tristran that she is already engaged to Robert Monday. She never believed he would go through with his quest, but is nonetheless willing to keep her promise and marry him. Tristran, not wishing to force Victoria into marrying him, reminds her that marriage was not the promise, but rather to give him anything he desired. He says that he desires that she marry Monday.

Tristran later returns to Yvaine at the market. She is delighted to learn that Victoria will marry someone else, and that Tristran reciprocates her love. Meanwhile, Una is freed as her enslavement ends when the moon loses her child (Yvaine), if it happens in a week when two Mondays come together (the marriage of Victoria and Monday). Una seeks out Tristran and Yvaine and reveals herself as Tristran&#x27;s mother and the Lord of Stormhold&#x27;s only daughter. As such, Tristran is the last male heir of Stormhold, and Yvaine presents him with the pendant, which she has been carrying. Yvaine is approached by the witch-queen, whose youth has run out and is now older than ever. Yvaine, no longer afraid, explains that her heart is no longer for the taking as she has given it to Tristran.

Una returns to Stormhold to rule in Tristan&#x27;s stead, while he and Yvaine travel throughout Faerie. Years later, Tristran returns with Yvaine to Stormhold and assumes the lordship. When he grows old and dies, Yvaine continues to reign as Stormhold&#x27;s immortal ruler.

==Publication history==

&quot;Stardust&quot; was originally conceived by Gaiman and Vess as a &quot;story book with pictures&quot;, created by both, to be published by American company DC Comics. During an interview to be included in the audio book, Neil Gaiman explained how one day while driving he had seen a wall on the side of the road and had conceived the idea of Faerie being behind the wall. This sparked an idea in Gaiman&#x27;s head about an American novelist who moved to England where he would find out about this wall; at this time, the book was to be called &quot;Wall&quot;. Soon afterwards, Gaiman was nominated for a literary award, which he won, and at a celebratory party for the award he saw a shooting star and immediately came up with the idea of &quot;Stardust&quot;. Gaiman dragged Vess out of a party that he was at and outlined the plot to him and Vess agreed to do the illustrations. Initially, &quot;Stardust&quot; was released in 1997 as a prestige format four-issue comic mini-series. &quot;Stardust&quot; came out once a month in a square-bound, high-gloss booklet with high grade paper, high quality color and no advertisements.

Gaiman and Vess originally intended the story to be released complete, as a single book, which would better reproduce the painted illustrations of Vess and be a &quot;story book&quot; for all ages, and a release in this format was made in 1998. There was both a hardback () and a trade paperback edition (). It is more accurately titled Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess&#x27;s &quot;Stardust (Being a Romance within the Realms of Faerie)&quot;. The hardback edition is quarter-bound in faux leather with the author&#x27;s names, title, and several stars inlaid in foil. It also has reproductions of the serialized version&#x27;s covers and many sketches by Vess. The trade paperback has a very different cover design and illustrations by Vess, and has subsequently been reprinted with another different cover design.

Gaiman retains the copyright to the text and in 1999 decided, encouraged by publisher Avon, to publish &quot;Stardust&quot; as a conventional novel in hardback without illustrations. There was also a subsequent UK hardcover edition, from Hodder Headline. The book also proved popular with readers of the &quot;romance&quot; genre, although it is generally considered part of the fantasy genre. Thus the paperback publication was originally given three different covers which when placed side by side had one background image and a different primary image including a handsome man holding a woman in a passionate embrace, although this cover concept was never used.

In 1999, Charles Vess&#x27;s Green Man Press produced a portfolio as a benefit for Vess&#x27;s wife, Karen, who had been injured in a car accident, titled &quot;A Fall of Stardust&quot;, which contained two chapbooks and a series of art plates. The first chapbook, written by Gaiman, comprised &quot;Wall: A Prologue&quot; short story, &quot;Septimus&#x27; Triolet&quot; poem, &quot;Song of the Little Hairy Man&quot;, and &quot;The Old Warlock&#x27;s Reverie: A Pantoum&quot; poem. The second chapbook was a short story entitled &quot;The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse&quot; by Susanna Clarke. Art plates were illustrated by William Stout, Mike Mignola, Terri Windling, Bryan Talbot, Jill Thompson, Paul Chadwick, P. Craig Russell, Mark Crilley, Elizabeth Johns, Michael Zulli, Robin Mullins, Lisa Snellings, Terry Moore, Tony DiTerlizzi, Linda Medley, Lorenzo Mattotti, Zander Cannon, Dave McKean, Jeff Smith, Trina Robbins &amp; Steve Leialoha, Gary Gianni, Janine Johnston, Stan Sakai, Michael Kaluta, Moebius, Rebecca Guay, Geof Darrow, Brian Froud, and Charles Vess. Several plates were coloured by Eric Olive. Todd Klein worked with Charles Vess to create the unique logo. Those who order this collection directly from Green Man Press received an additional art plate by Sergio Aragonés.

In July 2007, a new hardcover edition was published by DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint, containing approximately fifty pages of new material, including new artwork and information on the production of the book.

Gaiman had potential ideas for more books following on from Stardust, one called &quot;Hellflier&quot; set about 5 years later, and another called &quot;Wall&quot; set about 150 years later.

Musical comedian Tim Minchin expressed interest in the idea of adapting the story into a stage musical during a Facebook Live Q&amp;A for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in October 2017 while discussing &quot;Matilda The Musical&quot;.

==Awards==
The original DC Comics series was nominated for the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Awards for Favorite Limited Series for 1998 and 1999. The collected edition of the series was also nominated for the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Award for Favorite Reprint Graphic Album for 1999.

In 1999, the Mythopoeic Society awarded it the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature. The novel was nominated for the Locus Award that same year. In 2000, it received an Alex Award from the American Library Association.

==Adaptations==
BBC Radio 4 produced a two-part radio adaptation first broadcast 17 December 2016, dramatized and directed by Dirk Maggs and featuring Eleanor Bron as narrator, Matthew Beard as Tristan, and Sophie Rundle as Yvaine.

<doc id="182434" wikidata="Q5274" url="?curid=182434" title="Balve">
<text>Balve is a town in the Märkischer Kreis district, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located in &quot;Hönnetal&quot;, a narrow valley created by the river Hönne, which is near the Sorpe Dam, formerly part of Balve, and at the north end of the Sauerland, near Dortmund. The town was established in 1975 with several divisions including Balve, Beckum and Eisborn and Garbeck.

== History ==

The first reference to Balve is from around 780, when it was mentioned that a Widukind owned a farm called &quot;Ballowa&quot;, another name for the town, although this reference has been disputed. The first undisputed reference was in 864, in which a blind girl from Balve was said to be healed at the grave of the Saint Ludger in the crypt of Werden Abbey.

Ballowa is also mentioned in the Thidrekssaga, a chivalric saga written in the mid-13th century in Norway. In the saga, Ballowa is the home of two dwarfs who taught Weyland much about making iron weapons. At the time of writing, Balve belonged to the county of Arnsberg.

In 1358 the town became the property of the Duchy of Westphalia, which belonged to the Archbishops of Cologne. In 1430 it was given the right to be called a city. During the Napoleonic period, it belonged for a short time (1802–1815) to Hesse, after which time it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia.

In 1975, following a substantial reorganisation of local government in Germany, the city was enlarged by the addition of the several former independent municipalities from the abolished &quot;Amt Balve&quot;, including Asbeck, Beckum, and Eisborn.

==Organizations, economy and transportation==

Local organizations include a Red Cross chapter, and the &quot;Schützenbruderschaft St. Sebastian Balve&quot;, founded in 1947. Primary schools in the town include &quot;Grundschule Balve&quot; and &quot;Grundschule Beckum&quot;. Several international companies have roots in the town, including &quot;Balver Zinn&quot;, &quot;Chemie Wocklum&quot;, and &quot;Kruse Group&quot;.

Train stations in Balve include Binolen, Volkringhausen, Sanssouci, Garbeck and Balve, the latter station part of the &quot;Hönnetalbahn&quot; (RB 54) line.

==Religion==

The main religion in Balve is Roman Catholicism. The church Saint Blaise, built in the 12th century and an example of Romanesque architecture, was consecrated to Mary. On February 3 each year a special ceremony is held in the church, called the Blessing of the Throats. The altar servers of Saint Blaise visit other cities every year, for example Georgsmarienhütte in 1982. Bones from Benedict of Nursia and Saint Blaise, and a 400-year-old monument for Hermann von Hatzfeld, are located in the church. Additionally, two Roman Catholic parishes have been present in Balve for several years.

A Lutheran church is located at Hönnetalstrasse near to the &quot;Gemeindezentrum&quot;.

==Culture==

===Performing arts===

The &quot;Männerchor 1860 Balve&quot; is the largest choir in Balve. Other choirs include the &quot;Männerchor Garbeck&quot; and &quot;MC Cäcilia Volkringhausen&quot;. The town&#x27;s bands include &quot;Musikverein Balve&quot; and &quot;Musikverein Garbeck&quot;.

Until 2005, the organization &quot;Festpiele Balver Höhle&quot; and the town of Balve have jointly hosted a jazz festival. Acts at the festival have included performances by Jan Garbarek and by Piirpauke. One of the theatre ensembles in Balve is the &quot;Kolpingtheatergruppe&quot;, directed by Christoph Rapp. Another form of entertainment, the Balver Märchenwochen, involves performing fairy tales at Christmas.

===Festivals===

The &quot;Festspiele Balver Höhle&quot; is held at the Balver Höhle, a cave in Balve. The festival is a major focus of the culture in and around the town, featuring music and theatre performances. The only marksmen&#x27;s festival, &quot;Schützenfest&quot;, is also held in a cave, and is organized by &quot;Schützenbruderschaft St. Sebastian&quot;.

A large bonfire on Easter Sunday is another tradition in Balve, organized by the &quot;Kolpingsfamilie Balve&quot;. On May 1 each year the fire brigade of Balve is invited to the &quot;Feuerwehrfest&quot;, and for 20 years a christmas market has organized by &quot;Balver Fachhandel&quot; that features a live nativity scene.

==Sports==
One of the soccer clubs in Balve, SG Balve/Garbeck, won the DFB-Ü 40-Cup in 2007. The town also organizes the Balve Optimum, a competition between horse riders.

Participants in the Balve Optimum have included:
;Horse jumping
*Reiner Klimke
*Paul Schockemöhle
*Ludger Beerbaum
*Markus Beerbaum
*Jessica Kürten (2007)
*Hugo Simon (2008)
*Meredith Michaels-Beerbaum (2008)
*Eva Bitter (2008)
;Dressage
*Isabell Werth (2008)
*Matthias Alexander Rath (2008)

==Points of interest==
There are many caves in the &quot;Hönnetal&quot;, including the Balver Höhle at &quot;Helle&quot;, a large cave used for cultural events such as concerts, stage acting and the annual marksmen&#x27;s festival, and the &quot;Reckenhöhle&quot;, a cave 1,478 ft in length that has flowstone. Experts have found signs of cannibalism in some of the caves.

Other points of interest include 
# The walls of an old Germanic farm, located Garbeck,
# Beckum, where scientists found bones from eight kind of species of dinosaurs from the cretaceous, and
# The &quot;Luisenhütte&quot;, the only surviving 18th-century blast furnace that is still in workable condition, situated close to the 14th-century castle &quot;Schloss Wocklum&quot;, the home of Count Dieter von Landsberg-Velen.
==Coat of arms==
The town&#x27;s coat of arms references the history of Balve. The eagle is taken from the arms of Arnsberg, and the black-and-white cross from that of Cologne. Both symbols were present in old seals of the city, of which the oldest known example dates from 1462. The coat of arms was officially granted on June 24, 1911, and confirmed on February 6, 1976, after the local government reorganization of 1975.

The bottom part of the coat of arms of the former &quot;Amt Balve&quot; is identical Bolve&#x27;s town arms. The top half showed St. Peter, wearing a red coat and holding in his left hand a golden key and in his right a golden book. This coat of arms was granted on March 5, 1957, and expired when the Amt was dissolved in 1975.

== Persons of interest ==
* Jean-Marc Gaulin (1962–), Canadian ice hockey player born in Balve
* Franz Hoffmeister (1898–1943), Roman Catholic priest
* Theodor Pröpper (1896–1979), composer and church musician

<doc id="182440" wikidata="Q360570" url="?curid=182440" title="Huey P. Newton">
<text>Huey Percy Newton (February 17, 1942 – August 22, 1989) was an African American revolutionary and political activist who founded the Black Panther Party. He ran the party as its first leader and crafted its ten-point manifesto with Bobby Seale in 1966.

Under Newton&#x27;s leadership, the Black Panther Party founded over 60 community support programs (renamed &quot;survival programs&quot; in 1971) including food banks, medical clinics, sickle cell anemia tests, prison busing for families of inmates, legal advice seminars, clothing banks, housing cooperatives, and their own ambulance service. The most famous of these programs was the Free Breakfast for Children program which fed thousands of impoverished children daily during the early 1970s. Newton also co-founded the &quot;Black Panther&quot; newspaper service, which became one of America&#x27;s most widely distributed African-American newspapers. In 1967, he was involved in a shootout which led to the death of police officer John Frey and injuries to himself and another police officer. In 1968, he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter for Frey&#x27;s death and sentenced to 2 to 15 years in prison. In May 1970, the conviction was reversed and after two subsequent trials ended in hung juries, the charges were dropped. Later in life, he was also accused of murdering Kathleen Smith and Betty Van Patter, although he was never convicted for either death.

Newton learned to read using Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, which influenced his philosophy of activism. He went on to earn a PhD in social philosophy from the University of California at Santa Cruz&#x27;s History of Consciousness program in 1980. In 1989, he was murdered in Oakland, California by Tyrone Robinson, a member of the Black Guerrilla Family.

Newton was known for being an advocate of the right of self-defense and used his position as a leader within the Black Panther Party to welcome women as well.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Newton was born in Monroe, Louisiana in 1942 during World War II, the youngest child of Armelia Johnson and Walter Newton, a sharecropper and Baptist preacher. His parents named him after Huey Long, former governor of Louisiana. Monroe is located in Louisiana&#x27;s Ouachita Parish, which has had a history of violence against Black people since the Reconstruction era. According to a 2015 report by the Equal Justice Initiative, from 1877 to 1950, a total of 37 Black people were documented as lynched in that parish. Most murders had taken place around the turn of the 20th century. This was the fifth-highest total of lynchings of any county in the Southern United States.

As a response to the violence, the Newton family migrated to Oakland, California, participating in the second wave of the Great Migration of African-Americans out of the South. The Newton family was close-knit but quite poor. They moved often within the San Francisco Bay Area during Newton&#x27;s childhood. Despite this, Newton said he never went without food and shelter as a child. As a teenager, he was arrested several times for criminal offenses, including gun possession and vandalism at age 14. Growing up in Oakland, Newton stated that he was &quot;made to feel ashamed of being black&quot;.

In his autobiography &quot;Revolutionary Suicide&quot;, he wrote:

Newton graduated from Oakland Technical High School in 1959. He attended Merritt College, where he earned an Associate of Arts degree in 1966. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; was an influential work in Newton&#x27;s early adult life; he told the court during the trial for the killing of officer John Frey, that he had learned to read from studying the &quot;Republic&quot;. After that, he started &quot;questioning everything&quot;. In his autobiography, &quot;Revolutionary Suicide&quot;, he states: &quot;Most of all, I questioned what was happening in my own family and in the community around me.&quot;

Newton continued his education, studying at San Francisco Law School, and the University of California at Santa Cruz, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He was a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. He later continued his studies and, in 1980, he completed a PhD in social philosophy at Santa Cruz.

===Founding of the Black Panther Party===
As a student at Merritt College in Oakland, Newton became involved in Bay Area politics. He joined the Afro-American Association (AAA), became a prominent member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity&#x27;s Beta Tau chapter, and played a role in getting the first African-American history course adopted as part of the college&#x27;s curriculum. Newton learned about black history from Donald Warden (who later would change his name to Khalid Abdullah Tariq Al-Mansour), the leader of the AAA. Later Newton concluded that Warden offered solutions that didn&#x27;t work. In his autobiography, Newton says of Warden, &quot;The mass media, the oppressors, give him public exposure for only one reason: he will lead the people away from the truth of their situation.&quot; In college, Newton read the works of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Frantz Fanon, Malcolm X, Mao Zedong, Émile Durkheim, and Che Guevara.

During his time at Merritt College, he met Bobby Seale, with whom he co-founded the Black Panther Party for Self Defense (BPP) in October 1966. Based on a casual conversation, Seale became chairman and Newton became minister of defense. The Black Panther Party was an African-American left-wing organization advocating for the right of self-defense for black people in the United States. The Black Panther Party&#x27;s beliefs were greatly influenced by Malcolm X. Newton stated: &quot;Therefore, the words on this page cannot convey the effect that Malcolm has had on the Black Panther Party, although, as far as I am concerned, the Party is a living testament to his life work.&quot; The party achieved national and international renown through their deep involvement in the Black Power movement and the politics of the 1960s and 1970s.

The party&#x27;s political goals, including better housing, jobs, and education for African-Americans, were documented in their Ten-Point Program, a set of guidelines to the Black Panther Party&#x27;s ideals and ways of operation. The group believed that violenceor the threat of itmight be needed to bring about social change. They sometimes made news with a show of force, as they did when they entered the California Legislature fully armed in order to protest a gun bill aimed at disarming them.

Newton adopted what he termed &quot;revolutionary humanism&quot;. Although he had previously attended Nation of Islam mosques, he wrote that &quot;I have had enough of religion and could not bring myself to adopt another one. I needed a more concrete understanding of social conditions. References to God or Allah did not satisfy my stubborn thirst for answers.&quot; Later, however, he stated that &quot;As far as I am concerned, when all of the questions are not answered, when the extraordinary is not explained, when the unknown is not known, then there is room for God because the unexplained and the unknown is God.&quot; Newton later decided to join a Christian church after the party disbanded during his marriage to Fredrika.

Newton would frequent pool halls, campuses, bars and other locations deep in the black community where people gathered in order to organize and recruit for the Panthers. While recruiting, Newton sought to educate those around him about the legality of self-defense. One of the reasons, he argued, why Black people continued to be persecuted was their lack of knowledge of the social institutions that could be made to work in their favor. In Newton&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Revolutionary Suicide&quot;, he writes, &quot;Before I took Criminal Evidence in school, I had no idea what my rights were.&quot;

Newton also wrote in his autobiography, &quot;I tried to transform many of the so-called criminal activities going on in the street into something political, although this had to be done gradually.&quot; He attempted to channel these &quot;daily activities for survival&quot; into significant community actions. Eventually, the illicit activities of a few members would be superimposed on the social program work performed by the Panthers, and this mischaracterization would lose them some support in black communities and white.

Newton and the Panthers started a number of social programs in Oakland, including founding the Oakland Community School, which provided high-level education to 150 children from impoverished urban neighborhoods. Other Panther programs included the Free Breakfast for Children Program and others that offered dances for teenagers and training in martial arts. According to Oakland County Supervisor John George: &quot;Huey could take street-gang types and give them a social consciousness.&quot;

In 1982, Newton was accused of embezzling $600,000 of state aid to the Panther-founded Oakland Community School. In the wake of the embezzlement charges, Newton disbanded the Black Panther Party. The embezzlement charges were dropped six years later in March 1989, after Newton pleaded no contest to a single allegation of cashing a $15,000 state check for personal use. He was sentenced to six months in jail and 18 months probation.

===Fatal shooting of John Frey===
Newton had been convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for repeatedly stabbing another man, Odell Lee, with a steak knife in mid-1964. He served six months in prison. By October 27–28, 1967, he was out celebrating the release from his probationary period. Just before dawn on October 28, Newton and a friend were pulled over by Oakland Police Department officer John Frey. Realizing who Newton was, Frey called for backup. After fellow officer Herbert Heanes arrived, shots were fired, and all three were wounded.

Heanes testified that the shooting began after Newton was under arrest, and one witness testified that Newton shot Frey with Frey&#x27;s own gun as they wrestled. No gun on either Frey or Newton was found. Newton stated that Frey shot him first, which made him lose consciousness during the incident. Frey was shot four times and died within the hour, while Heanes was left in serious condition with three bullet wounds. Black Panther David Hilliard took Newton to Oakland&#x27;s Kaiser Hospital, where he was admitted with a bullet wound to the abdomen. Newton was soon handcuffed to his bed and arrested for Frey&#x27;s killing. A doctor, Thomas Finch, and nurse, Corrine Leonard, attended to Newton when he arrived at the hospital, and Finch stated that Newton was &quot;agitated&quot; when asking for treatment and that Newton was given a tranquilizer to calm him.

Newton was convicted in September 1968 of voluntary manslaughter for the killing of Frey and was sentenced to 2 to 15 years in prison. In May 1970, the California Appellate Court reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial. After two subsequent trials ended in hung juries, the district attorney said he would not pursue a fourth trial, and the Alameda County Superior Court dismissed the charges. In his autobiography, &quot;Revolutionary Suicide&quot;, Newton wrote that Heanes and Frey were opposite each other and shooting in each other&#x27;s direction during the shootout.

Hugh Pearson, in his book &quot;Shadow of the Panther&quot;, writes that Newton, while intoxicated, boasted about having willfully killed Frey.

===&quot;Free Huey!&quot; campaign===

Newton was arrested on the day of the shooting on October 28, 1967, and pled not guilty to the murder of officer John Frey. The Black Panther Party immediately went to work organizing a coalition to rally behind Newton and champion his release. In December the Peace and Freedom Party, a majority white anti-war political organization, joined with the Black Panther Party in support of Newton. This alliance served the dual purpose of legitimizing Newton&#x27;s cause while boosting the credibility of the party within the community of more radical activists.

Under the leadership of the Black Panther Party and the Peace and Freedom Party, 5,000 protesters gathered in Oakland on Newton&#x27;s birthday, February 17, 1968, in support of Newton. They garnered the attention of international news organizations, raising the profile of the party by astounding measures. The phrase &quot;Free Huey!&quot; was adopted as a rallying cry for the movement, and it was printed on buttons and T-shirts. Prominent Black Panther Kathleen Cleaver claimed the goal of the Free Huey! campaign was to elevate Newton as a symbol of everything the Black Panther Party stood for, creating something of a living martyr. The trial, which began on July 15, quickly ascended beyond the scope of Newton himself, evolving into a racially-charged political movement. Over the two-year course of Newton&#x27;s original trial and two appeals, the coalition continued to offer its support until the charges were overturned and Newton was released on August 5, 1970.

===Visit to China===

In 1970, after his release from prison, Newton received an invitation to visit the People&#x27;s Republic of China. On learning of Nixon&#x27;s plan to visit China in 1972, Newton decided to visit before him. Newton made the trip in late September 1971 with fellow Panthers, Elaine Brown and Robert Bay, and stayed for 10 days. At every Chinese airport he landed in, Newton was greeted by thousands of people waving copies of the &quot;Little Red Book&quot; (officially titled &quot;Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung&quot;) and displaying signs that said, &quot;We support the Black Panther Party, down with U.S. imperialism,&quot; or, &quot;We support the American people but the Nixon imperialist regime must be overthrown.&quot;

During the trip, the Chinese arranged for him to meet and have dinner with an ambassador from North Korea, an ambassador from Tanzania, and delegations from both North Vietnam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam. Newton was under the impression he was going to meet Mao Zedong, chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, but instead had two meetings with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. One of these meetings also included Mao&#x27;s wife Jiang Qing. Newton described China as &quot;a free and liberated territory with a socialist government&quot;.

Following Newton&#x27;s Asian trip, the Black Panther Party began incorporating North Korea&#x27;s &quot;Juche&quot; ideals into the party&#x27;s ideology.

===Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ===
In January 1977, Jim Jones, leader of the Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ (commonly shortened to the Peoples Temple), visited Newton in Havana, Cuba.

That same year after Jones fled to &quot;Jonestown&quot;, a commune he established in Guyana for his followers, Newton spoke to Temple members in Jonestown via telephone expressing support for Jones during one of the Temple&#x27;s earliest &quot;White Nights&quot;. Newton&#x27;s cousin, Stanley Clayton, was one of the few residents of Jonestown to escape the area before the 1978 mass murder of over 900 Temple members by Jones and his enforcers through forced suicide.

===Allegations of violence===

By the 1970s, Newton had allegedly become increasingly paranoid, addicted to crack cocaine, and prone to violent behavior.

On August 6, 1974, Kathleen Smith, a 17-year-old Oakland native and child prostitute was shot; she died three months later. According to the prosecutor handling the case, Newton is believed to have shot Smith after a casual exchange on the street during which she referred to him as &quot;Baby,&quot; a childhood nickname he hated. The main witness of this case refused to testify due to an assassination attempt against her and, after two deadlocked jury trials, Newton was not convicted.

Newton is also alleged to have assaulted his tailor over the price of a suit. Newton posted bond after being arrested for pistol-whipping the tailor in 1974. The incident occurred after a dispute arose regarding the price of a custom-made suit. Newton, known for his status as a prominent figure in the Black Panther Party, reportedly became enraged over the cost and the perceived overcharging. This event is often referenced in discussions of Newton&#x27;s complex persona, which combined revolutionary ideals with a more flamboyant and sometimes violent personal side.

Newton was subsequently arrested a second time for the murder of Smith, but was able to post an additional $80,000 bond, thus securing his release until trial. Newton and his girlfriend (later his wife) Gwen Fontaine then fled to Havana, Cuba, where they lived until 1977, which prevented further prosecution on the two charges. Elaine Brown took over as chairperson of the Black Panther Party in his absence. Newton returned to the United States in 1977 to stand trial for the murder of Smith and the assault on the tailor.

In October 1977, three Black Panthers attempted to assassinate Crystal Gray, a key prosecution witness in Newton&#x27;s upcoming trial who had been present the day of Kathleen Smith&#x27;s murder. Unknown to the assailants, they attacked the wrong house and the occupant returned fire. During the shootout one of the Panthers, Louis Johnson, was killed, and the other two assailants escaped. One of the two surviving assassins, Flores Forbes, fled to Las Vegas, Nevada, with the help of Panther paramedic Nelson Malloy. In November 1977, Malloy was found by park rangers paralyzed from the waist down from bullet wounds to the back in a shallow grave in the desert outside of Las Vegas. According to Malloy, he and Forbes were ordered by &quot;higher-ups&quot; to be killed to eliminate any eyewitness accounts of the attempted murder of Crystal Gray. Malloy recovered from the assault and told police that fellow Panthers Rollin Reid and Allen Lewis were behind his attempted murder. Newton denied any involvement or knowledge and said that the events &quot;might have been the result of overzealous party members.&quot; After the assassination attempt on Crystal Gray, she declined to testify against Newton. After two trials and two deadlocked juries, the prosecution decided not to retry Newton for Smith&#x27;s murder. Journalist Ken Kelley, three weeks after Newton&#x27;s death, claimed that Newton had confessed to him that he murdered Smith and ordered the murder of Betty Van Patter.

During Newton&#x27;s trial for assaulting the tailor, the tailor, who changed his testimony several times, eventually told the jury that he did not know who assaulted him. Newton was acquitted of the assault in September 1978, but convicted of illegal firearms possession and served 9 months in prison in 1987.

In 2007, party member Ericka Huggins stated in an interview that Newton repeatedly raped her and threatened that if she told anyone he would hurt her children.

=== Murder ===
In the early hours of August 22, 1989, Newton was murdered in front of 1456 9th Street, near the corner of Center Street in the Prescott neighborhood of Oakland, California. Within days, Tyrone Robinson was arrested as a suspect; he was on parole and admitted the murder to police, claiming self-defense, though police found no evidence that Newton was carrying a gun. In 1991, Robinson was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to a prison term of 32 years to life. His next parole hearing is set for November 2028. Robinson stated that his motive was to advance in the Black Guerrilla Family, a narcotics prison gang, in order to get a crack franchise.

Newton&#x27;s funeral was held at Allen Temple Baptist Church, which he attended following his conversion. Some 1,300 mourners were accommodated inside, and another 500 to 600 listened to the service from outside. Newton&#x27;s achievements in civil rights and work on behalf of Black children and families with the Black Panther Party were celebrated. Newton&#x27;s body was cremated, and his ashes were interred at Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland.

On February 17, 2021, in commemoration of the Black Panther Party the City of Oakland erected a bust of Huey Newton near the street corner where he was murdered. That same year, a commemorative plaque &quot;Dr. Huey P. Newton Way&quot; was applied to this section of 9th Street.

==Writing and scholarship==
Newton received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1974. In 1978, while in prison, Newton met evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers after Newton applied to do a reading course with Trivers as part of a graduate degree in history of consciousness. He and Trivers became close friends, they published an analysis of the role of flight crew self-deception in the 1982 crash of Air Florida Flight 90, and Trivers dedicated one chapter of his autobiography to his relationship with Newton.

Newton earned a PhD in the social philosophy program of History of Consciousness from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1980. His doctoral dissertation titled &quot;War Against the Panthers: A Study of Repression in America&quot; &quot;analyzes certain features of the Party and incidents that are significant in its development&quot;, among which are how the United States federal government responded to the BPP as well as to the assassinations of Fred Hampton, Bunchy Carter, and John Huggins. Sources for material used to support the dissertation include two federal civil rights lawsuits. One suit was against the FBI and other government officials, while the other was initially against the City of Chicago.

Later, Newton&#x27;s widow, Fredrika Newton, would discuss her husband&#x27;s often-ignored academic research during C-SPAN&#x27;s &quot;American Perspectives&quot; program on February 18, 2006. After the decline of the Black Panther Party, Huey P. Newton completed and copyrighted dozens of essays on philosophy, political theology, evolutionary biology, and political economy which remain unpublished and held in archive at Stanford University.

<text>Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming (1 April 1859 – 14 June 1923) was a British naval officer who served as the first chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS).

==Origins==
He was a great-great-grandson of the prominent merchant John Smith, a director of both the South Sea Company and the East India Company, the second son of Abel Smith (d. 1756), the Nottingham banker who founded a banking dynasty and whose business much later became National Westminster Bank, now one of the largest banks in the United Kingdom. His father was Colonel John Thomas Smith of the Madras Royal Engineers who became Master of the Madras and Calcutta Mints and designed a machine for minting coins that was displayed at the Great Exhibition in 1851.

==Early naval career==
Smith joined the Royal Navy and underwent training at Dartmouth from the age of twelve and was appointed acting sub-lieutenant in 1878. He was posted to HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot; in 1877, and for the next seven years served in operations against Malay pirates (during 1875–6) and in Egypt in 1883. However, he increasingly suffered from seasickness, and in 1885 was placed on the retired list as &quot;unfit for service&quot;. In early 1903 he was posted (as a retired lieutenant) to HMS &quot;Venus&quot; as it became coastguard ship at Southampton. Prior to being appointed to run the Secret Service Bureau (SSB), he was working on boom defences in Bursledon on the River Hamble.

He added the surname Cumming after his marriage in 1889 to Leslie Marian Valiant-Cumming, heiress of Logie near Forres in the County of Moray.

== Head of the SIS ==

===Pre-1914===
In 1909, Major (later Colonel Sir) Vernon Kell became director of the new Secret Service Bureau and created as a response to growing public opinion that all Germans living in England were spies. In 1911, the various security organizations were re-organised under the Bureau, Kell&#x27;s division becoming the Home Section, and Cumming&#x27;s becoming the new Foreign Section, responsible for all operations outside Britain. Over the next few years he became known as &#x27;C&#x27;, after his habit of sometimes signing himself with a C eventually written in green ink. That habit became a custom for later directors, although the C now stands for &quot;Chief&quot;. Ian Fleming took these aspects for his &quot;M&quot; from the James Bond novels.

In 1914, he was involved in a serious road accident in France in which his son was killed. Legend has it that to escape the car wreck he was forced to amputate his own leg using a pen knife. Hospital records have shown, however, that while both his legs were broken, his left foot was amputated only the day after the accident. Later he often told all sorts of fantastic stories as to how he lost his leg and would shock people by interrupting meetings in his office by suddenly stabbing his artificial leg with a knife, letter opener or fountain pen.

Budgets were severely limited prior to World War I, and Cumming came to rely heavily on Sidney Reilly (aka the &quot;Ace of Spies&quot;), a secret agent of dubious veracity based in Saint Petersburg.

===World War I===
At the outbreak of war he was able to work with Vernon Kell and Sir Basil Thomson of the Special Branch to arrest twenty-two German spies in England. Eleven were executed, as was Sir Roger Casement, found guilty of treason in 1916. During the war, the offices were renamed. The Home Section became MI5 or Security Service, while Cumming&#x27;s Foreign Section became MI6 or the Secret Intelligence Service. Agents who worked for MI6 during the war included Augustus Agar, Paul Dukes, John Buchan, Compton Mackenzie and W. Somerset Maugham.

When the SSB discovered that semen made a good invisible ink, his agents adopted the motto &quot;Every man his own stylo&quot;. However, the use of semen as invisible ink was ceased because of the smell it produced for the eventual receiver. It also raised questions over the masturbatory habits of the agents.

===Ireland===

The Government Committee on Intelligence decided to slash Kell&#x27;s budget and staff and to subordinate MI5 under a new Home Office Civil Intelligence Directorate led by Special Branch&#x27;s Sir Basil Thomson in January 1919. The powerful partnership of MI5 and Special Branch had managed counterintelligence and subversives during the war, but that was suddenly thrown into disarray. These bureaucratic intrigues happened at the very moment when the Irish abstentionist party Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) were launching their own independence campaign.

Cumming and SIS (then MI1(c)) organized a new espionage unit in Ireland in mid-1920 called the Dublin District Special Branch. It consisted of some 20 line officers drawn from the regular army and trained by Cumming&#x27;s department in London. Cumming also began importing some of his own veteran case officers into Ireland from Egypt, Palestine, and India, while Basil Thomson organized a special unit consisting of 60 Irish street agents managed by communications from Scotland Yard in London.

On Sunday, 21 November 1920, the Headquarters Intelligence Staff of the IRA and its special Counterintelligence Branch under the leadership of Michael Collins assassinated 14 of Cumming&#x27;s case officers. Many agents appear to have escaped the IRA execution squads that morning, but Whitehall feared that more of its professional agents would be identified and suffer the same fate; this prompted the hasty withdrawal of most of the remaining SIS agents from Ireland in the days that followed. 

===Commemmoration===
A blue plaque was unveiled on 30 March 2015 in Cumming&#x27;s name at the SIS headquarters at 2 Whitehall Court.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
*Cumming was the basis for the fictional head of the SIS, named Control, in the John le Carré espionage novel &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; and other novels. In the movie version of le Carré&#x27;s &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; Control signs his name as &#x27;C&#x27; using green ink, as Cumming did in real life.
*Cumming was also the basis for the fictional head of SIS in the original James Bond novels by Ian Fleming. Fleming chose to name his chief M from Cumming&#x27;s first name, Mansfield; this naming convention was extended to characters such as Q and R.
*In the television series &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot;, he was portrayed by Norman Rodway.
*He was portrayed by Joss Ackland in the BBC1 TV series &quot;Ashenden&quot; in 1991.

<doc id="182444" wikidata="Q380677" url="?curid=182444" title="Thermoplastic">
<text>A thermoplastic, or thermosoftening plastic, is any plastic polymer material that becomes pliable or moldable at a certain elevated temperature and solidifies upon cooling. 

Most thermoplastics have a high molecular weight. The polymer chains associate by intermolecular forces, which weaken rapidly with increased temperature, yielding a viscous liquid. In this state, thermoplastics may be reshaped, and are typically used to produce parts by various polymer processing techniques such as injection molding, compression molding, calendering, and extrusion. Thermoplastics differ from thermosetting polymers (or &quot;thermosets&quot;), which form irreversible chemical bonds during the curing process. Thermosets do not melt when heated, but typically decompose and do not reform upon cooling.

Above its glass transition temperature and below its melting point, the physical properties of a thermoplastic change drastically without an associated phase change. Some thermoplastics do not fully crystallize below the glass transition temperature, retaining some or all of their amorphous characteristics. Amorphous and semi-amorphous plastics are used when high optical clarity is necessary, as light is scattered strongly by crystallites larger than its wavelength. Amorphous and semi-amorphous plastics are less resistant to chemical attack and environmental stress cracking because they lack a crystalline structure.

Brittleness can be decreased with the addition of plasticizers, which increases the mobility of amorphous chain segments to effectively lower the glass transition temperature. Modification of the polymer through copolymerization or through the addition of non-reactive side chains to monomers before polymerization can also lower it. Before these techniques were employed, plastic automobile parts would often crack when exposed to cold temperatures. These are linear or slightly branched long chain molecules capable of repeatedly softening on heating and hardening on cooling.

==Acrylic==
Today&#x27;s acrylics industry can be divided into two distinct multibillion-dollar markets: on one hand the polyacrylic acids (PAA) and its ester derivatives (PAc) market, on the other hand, the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) market. PMMA is also known by trade names such as Lucite, Perspex and Plexiglas. It serves as a sturdy substitute for glass for items such as aquariums, buttons, motorcycle helmet visors, aircraft windows, viewing ports of submersibles, and lenses of exterior lights of automobiles. It is extensively used to make signs, including lettering and logos. In medicine, it is used in bone cement and to replace eye lenses. Acrylic paint consists of PMMA particles suspended in water.

For many decades, PMMA has been the predominant methacrylic ester produced worldwide. Major players in the PMMA market are Mitsubishi Rayon (Japan), Arkema SA (France), LG MMA (South Korea), Chi Mei Corp. (Taiwan), Sumimoto Chemical Company Ltd (Japan), Evonik Industries (Germany), BASF (Germany), Dow Chemical Company (U.S.), AkzoNobel (The Netherlands), Quinn Plastics (UK) and Cytec Industries (U.S.). Regarding the PAA and PAc market, key manufacturers are Nippon Shokubai Company Ltd. (Japan), Arkema SA (France) and Dow Chemical Company (U.S.)

==ABS==
Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is a terpolymer synthesized from styrene and acrylonitrile in the presence of polybutadiene. ABS is a light-weight material that exhibits high impact resistance and mechanical toughness. It poses few risks to human health under normal handling. It is used in many consumer products, such as toys, appliances, and telephones.

==Nylon==
Nylon belongs to a class of polymers called polyamides. It has served as a substitute mainly for hemp, cotton and silk, in products such as parachutes, cords, sails, flak vests and clothing. Nylon fibres are useful in making fabrics, rope, carpets and musical strings, whereas, in bulk form, nylon is used for mechanical parts including machine screws, gears and power tool casings. In addition, it is used in the manufacture of heat-resistant composite materials.

==PLA==
Polylactic acid (polylactide) is a compostable thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, such as corn starch (in the United States), sugar beet pulp (in Europe), tapioca roots, chips or starch (mostly in Asia), or sugarcane. It is the most common material used for 3D printing with fused deposition modeling (FDM) techniques.

==Polybenzimidazole==
Polybenzimidazole (PBI, short for Poly-[2,2’-(m-phenylen)-5,5’-bisbenzimidazole]) fiber is a synthetic fiber with a very high melting point. It has exceptional thermal and chemical stability and does not readily ignite. It was first discovered by American polymer chemist Carl Shipp Marvel in the pursuit of new materials with superior stability, retention of stiffness, toughness at elevated temperature. Due to its high stability, polybenzimidazole is used to fabricate high-performance protective apparel such as firefighter&#x27;s gear, astronaut space suits, high temperature protective gloves, welders&#x27; apparel and aircraft wall fabrics. In recent years, polybenzimidazole found its application as membrane in fuel cells.

==Polycarbonate==
Polycarbonate (PC) thermoplastics are known under trademarks such as Lexan, Makrolon, Makroclear, and arcoPlus. They are easily worked, molded, and thermoformed for many applications, such as electronic components, construction materials, data storage devices, automotive and aircraft parts, check sockets in prosthetics, and security glazing. Polycarbonates do not have a unique resin identification code. Items made from polycarbonate can contain the precursor monomer bisphenol A (BPA). Susceptible to UV light, exposure results in yellowing (degradation is especially visible in headlamps that lost or didn&#x27;t have proper protective coating).

==Polyether sulfone==
Polyether sulfone (PES) or polysulfone is a class of specially engineered thermoplastics with high thermal, oxidative, and hydrolytic stability, and good resistance to aqueous mineral acids, alkalis, salt solutions, oils and greases.

==Polyoxymethylene==
Polyoxymethylene (POM), also known as acetal, polyacetal and polyformaldehyde, is an engineering thermoplastic used in precision parts requiring high stiffness, low friction, and excellent dimensional stability. As with many other synthetic polymers, it is produced by different chemical firms with slightly different formulas and sold variously by such names as Delrin, Celcon, Ramtal, Duracon, Kepital and Hostaform.

==Polyether ether ketone==
Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is a colourless organic thermoplastic polymer in the polyaryletherketone (PAEK) family, used in engineering applications. It was originally introduced by Victrex PLC, then ICI (Imperial Chemical Industries) in the early 1980s. It has attractive properties like good abrasion resistance, low flammability and emission of smoke and toxic gases.

==Polyetherimide==
Polyetherimide (PEI), produced by a novel nitro displacement reaction involving bisphenol A, 4, 4’-methylenedianiline and 3-nitrophthalic anhydride, has high heat distortion temperature, tensile strength and modulus. They are generally used in high performance electrical and electronic parts, microwave appliances, and under-the-hood automotive parts.

==Polyethylene==
Polyethylene (polyethene, polythene, PE) is a family of similar materials categorized according to their density and molecular structure. It is also known as poly and is obtained by the addition polymerisation of ethylene. It may be of low density or high density depending upon the process used in its manufacturing. It is resistant to moisture and most of the chemicals. It is flexible at room temperature (and low temperature) and can be heat sealed. Since it is an inexpensive plastic it is made in large amounts to cater to the demand. For example: 
* ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is tough and resistant to chemicals. It is used to manufacture moving machine parts, bearings, gears, artificial joints and some bulletproof vests. 
* High-density polyethylene (HDPE), recyclable plastic no. 2, is commonly used as milk jugs, liquid laundry detergent bottles, outdoor furniture, margarine tubs, portable gasoline cans, drinking water distribution systems, water drainage pipes, and grocery bags. 
* Medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) is used for packaging film, sacks and gas pipes and fittings. 
* Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is flexible and is used in the manufacture of squeeze bottles, milk jug caps, retail store bags and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) as stretch wrap in transporting and handling boxes of durable goods, and as the common household food covering.

==Polyphenylene oxide==
Polyphenylene oxide (PPO), which is obtained from the free-radical, step-growth oxidative coupling polymerization of 2,6-xylenol, has many attractive properties such as high heat distortion and impact strength, chemical stability to mineral and organic acids, and low water absorption. PPO is difficult to process, and hence the commercial resin (Noryl) is made by blending PPO with high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), which serves to reduce the processing temperature.

==Polyphenylene sulfide==
Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) obtained by the condensation polymerization of p-dichlorobenzene and sodium sulfide, has outstanding chemical resistance, good electrical properties, excellent flame retardance, low coefficient of friction and high transparency to microwave radiation. PPS is principally used in coating applications. This is done by spraying an aqueous slurry of PPS particles and heating to temperatures above 370 °C. Particular grades of PPS can be used in injection and compression molding at temperatures (300 to 370 °C) at which PPS particles soften and undergo apparent crosslinking. Principal applications of injection and compression molded PPS include cookware, bearings, and pump parts for service in various corrosive environments.

==Polypropylene==
Polypropylene (PP) is useful for such diverse products as reusable plastic food containers, microwave- and dishwasher-safe plastic containers, diaper lining, sanitary pad lining and casing, ropes, carpets, plastic moldings, piping systems, car batteries, insulation for electrical cables and filters for gases and liquids. In medicine, it is used in hernia treatment and to make heat-resistant medical equipment. Polypropylene sheets are used for stationery folders and packaging and clear storage bins. Polypropylene is defined by the recyclable plastic number 5. Although relatively inert, it is vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation and can degrade considerably in direct sunlight. Polypropylene is not as impact-resistant as the polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE). It is also somewhat permeable to highly volatile gases and liquids.

==Polystyrene==
Polystyrene is manufactured in various forms that have different applications and can have medium to very low density. Extruded polystyrene (PS or xPS, sometimes colored pink/blue) is used in the manufacture of disposable cutlery, rigid ground contact rated insulating foam board, CD and DVD cases, plastic models of cars and boats, and smoke detector housings. Expanded polystyrene foam (EPS or &quot;styrofoam&quot;, white) is used in making insulation and packaging materials, such as the &quot;peanuts&quot; and molded foam used to cushion fragile products. Polystyrene copolymers are used in the manufacture of toys and product casings.

==Polyvinyl chloride==
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a tough, lightweight material that is durable, fairly rigid and versatile, and is resistant to acids and bases. Much of it is used by the construction industry, such as for vinyl siding, drainpipes, gutters and roofing sheets. It is also converted to flexible forms with the addition of plasticizers, thereby making it useful for items such as hoses, tubing, electrical insulation, coats, jackets and upholstery. Flexible PVC is also used in inflatable products, such as water beds and pool toys. PVC is also a common material in vinyl action figures, especially in countries such as Japan, where the material is used extensively in so-called Sofubi figures (Soft vinyl toys). As PVC bends easily and has a tendency to be bent during transit, a method to mitigate this deformation is to heat the plastic until it becomes mobile, then reform the material into the desired shape.

PVC is produced in many specific modifications to affect its chemical and physical properties. In plasticized polyvinyl chloride (pPVC), plasticizers are added to the raw material before molding to make it more flexible or pliable. Early on, the health and environmental aspects of this were poorly understood and replacements and product bans resulted after studies. The original form is often referred to as unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC), which is the more commonly used type for installations such as water, waste, and sewer conveyance plumbing.

Chemical modification often produces more drastic changes in properties. Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) is produced through exposing PVC to the continued free-radical chlorination reaction that originally formulates the PVC polymer. The chlorination reaction continues to add chlorine atoms to the polymer hydrocarbon backbone until most commercial applications reach a percent range between 56 and 74% total chlorine. This increase in elemental chlorine content contributes to CPVC&#x27;s increased expression of chlorine-based characteristics, such as chemical durability, resistance to acids, bases, and salts; susceptibility to ammonia-based compounds, aromatics, esters, ketones; chemical stability; heat energy transfer resistance. CPVC is commonly used in water, chemical, hot and cold, delivery systems for residential, commercial, and industrial applications.

==Polyvinylidene fluoride==
Polyvinylidene fluoride, PVDF, belongs to the fluoropolymer class of thermoplastics and is known for its high chemical inertness and resistance. PVDF is obtained through the polymerization of the vinylidene fluoride monomer. PVDF thermoplastic is fabricated into sheets and pipes for engineering uses as well as powders and coatings that can be dissolved in solvents and applied across a product surface. PVDF is widely used in the chemical industry as piping for aggressive chemicals and high purity liquids. The PVDF material is used in construction, transportation, chemical processes, electricity, batteries, waste water and treatment.

==Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon)==
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene is commonly recognized under the brand name Teflon. PTFE is hydrophobic: aqueous liquids do not wet the material, as fluorocarbons demonstrate mitigated London dispersion forces due to the high electronegativity of fluorine. This also supports its use in coatings of cooking ware. The polymer has one of the lowest coefficients of friction of any solid and is therefore commonly used for bearings and support of moving mechanical parts.

== Thermoplastic Composites ==
Thermoplastic composites (TPCs) are a class of composite materials that consist of a thermoplastic polymer matrix reinforced with fibers such as carbon, glass, or aramid. Unlike thermoset composites, which undergo irreversible curing, thermoplastics can be melted and reshaped multiple times, making them more recyclable and repairable. Due to their high strength-to-weight ratio, impact resistance, and processability, thermoplastic composites are widely used in aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications.

<text>Fermi liquid theory (also known as Landau&#x27;s Fermi-liquid theory) is a theoretical model of interacting fermions that describes the normal state of the conduction electrons in most metals at sufficiently low temperatures. The theory describes the behavior of many-body systems of particles in which the interactions between particles may be strong. The phenomenological theory of Fermi liquids was introduced by the Soviet physicist Lev Davidovich Landau in 1956, and later developed by Alexei Abrikosov and Isaak Khalatnikov using diagrammatic perturbation theory. The theory explains why some of the properties of an interacting fermion system are very similar to those of the ideal Fermi gas (collection of non-interacting fermions), and why other properties differ.

Fermi liquid theory applies most notably to conduction electrons in normal (non-superconducting) metals, and to liquid helium-3. Liquid helium-3 is a Fermi liquid at low temperatures (but not low enough to be in its superfluid phase). An atom of helium-3 has two protons, one neutron and two electrons, giving an odd number of fermions, so the atom itself is a fermion. Fermi liquid theory also describes the low-temperature behavior of electrons in heavy fermion materials, which are metallic rare-earth alloys having partially filled f orbitals. The effective mass of electrons in these materials is much larger than the free-electron mass because of interactions with other electrons, so these systems are known as &quot;heavy Fermi liquids&quot;. Strontium ruthenate displays some key properties of Fermi liquids, despite being a strongly correlated material that is similar to high temperature superconductors such as the cuprates. The low-momentum interactions of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in atomic nuclei are also described by Fermi liquid theory.

==Description==

The key ideas behind Landau&#x27;s theory are the notion of &quot;adiabaticity&quot; and the Pauli exclusion principle. Consider a non-interacting fermion system (a Fermi gas), and suppose we &quot;turn on&quot; the interaction slowly. Landau argued that in this situation, the ground state of the Fermi gas would adiabatically transform into the ground state of the interacting system.

By Pauli&#x27;s exclusion principle, the ground state formula_1 of a Fermi gas consists of fermions occupying all momentum states corresponding to momentum formula_2 with all higher momentum states unoccupied. As the interaction is turned on, the spin, charge and momentum of the fermions corresponding to the occupied states remain unchanged, while their dynamical properties, such as their mass, magnetic moment etc. are &quot;renormalized&quot; to new values. Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elementary excitations of a Fermi gas system and a Fermi liquid system. In the context of Fermi liquids, these excitations are called &quot;quasiparticles&quot;.

Landau quasiparticles are long-lived excitations with a lifetime formula_3 that satisfies formula_4 where formula_5 is the quasiparticle energy (measured from the Fermi energy). At finite temperature, formula_5 is on the order of the thermal energy formula_7, and the condition for Landau quasiparticles can be reformulated as formula_8.

For this system, the many-body Green&#x27;s function can be written (near its poles) in the form

:formula_9

where formula_10 is the chemical potential, formula_11 is the energy corresponding to the given momentum state and formula_12 is called the &quot;quasiparticle residue&quot; or &quot;renormalisation constant&quot; which is very characteristic of Fermi liquid theory. The spectral function for the system can be directly observed via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and can be written (in the limit of low-lying excitations) in the form:

:formula_13

where formula_14 is the Fermi velocity.

Physically, we can say that a propagating fermion interacts with its surrounding in such a way that the net effect of the interactions is to make the fermion behave as a &quot;dressed&quot; fermion, altering its effective mass and other dynamical properties. These &quot;dressed&quot; fermions are what we think of as &quot;quasiparticles&quot;.

Another important property of Fermi liquids is related to the scattering cross section for electrons. Suppose we have an electron with energy formula_15 above the Fermi surface, and suppose it scatters with a particle in the Fermi sea with energy formula_16. By Pauli&#x27;s exclusion principle, both the particles after scattering have to lie above the Fermi surface, with energies formula_17. Now, suppose the initial electron has energy very close to the Fermi surface formula_18 Then, we have that formula_19 also have to be very close to the Fermi surface. This reduces the phase space volume of the possible states after scattering, and hence, by Fermi&#x27;s golden rule, the scattering cross section goes to zero. Thus we can say that the lifetime of particles at the Fermi surface goes to infinity.

==Similarities to Fermi gas==
The Fermi liquid is qualitatively analogous to the non-interacting Fermi gas, in the following sense: The system&#x27;s dynamics and thermodynamics at low excitation energies and temperatures may be described by substituting the non-interacting fermions with interacting quasiparticles, each of which carries the same spin, charge and momentum as the original particles. Physically these may be thought of as being particles whose motion is disturbed by the surrounding particles and which themselves perturb the particles in their vicinity. Each many-particle excited state of the interacting system may be described by listing all occupied momentum states, just as in the non-interacting system. As a consequence, quantities such as the heat capacity of the Fermi liquid behave qualitatively in the same way as in the Fermi gas (e.g. the heat capacity rises linearly with temperature).

==Differences from Fermi gas==
The following differences to the non-interacting Fermi gas arise:

===Energy===
The energy of a many-particle state is not simply a sum of the single-particle energies of all occupied states. Instead, the change in energy for a given change formula_20 in occupation of states formula_21 contains terms both linear and quadratic in formula_20 (for the Fermi gas, it would only be linear, formula_23, where formula_24 denotes the single-particle energies). The linear contribution corresponds to renormalized single-particle energies, which involve, e.g., a change in the effective mass of particles. The quadratic terms correspond to a sort of &quot;mean-field&quot; interaction between quasiparticles, which is parametrized by so-called Landau Fermi liquid parameters and determines the behaviour of density oscillations (and spin-density oscillations) in the Fermi liquid. Still, these mean-field interactions do not lead to a scattering of quasi-particles with a transfer of particles between different momentum states.

The renormalization of the mass of a fluid of interacting fermions can be calculated from first principles using many-body computational techniques. For the two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas, GW calculations and quantum Monte Carlo methods have been used to calculate renormalized quasiparticle effective masses.

===Specific heat and compressibility===
Specific heat, compressibility, spin-susceptibility and other quantities show the same qualitative behaviour (e.g. dependence on temperature) as in the Fermi gas, but the magnitude is (sometimes strongly) changed.

===Interactions===
In addition to the mean-field interactions, some weak interactions between quasiparticles remain, which lead to scattering of quasiparticles off each other. Therefore, quasiparticles acquire a finite lifetime. However, at low enough energies above the Fermi surface, this lifetime becomes very long, such that the product of excitation energy (expressed in frequency) and lifetime is much larger than one. In this sense, the quasiparticle energy is still well-defined (in the opposite limit, Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty relation would prevent an accurate definition of the energy).

===Structure===
The structure of the &quot;bare&quot; particles (as opposed to quasiparticle) many-body Green&#x27;s function is similar to that in the Fermi gas (where, for a given momentum, the Green&#x27;s function in frequency space is a delta peak at the respective single-particle energy). The delta peak in the density-of-states is broadened (with a width given by the quasiparticle lifetime). In addition (and in contrast to the quasiparticle Green&#x27;s function), its weight (integral over frequency) is suppressed by a quasiparticle weight factor formula_25. The remainder of the total weight is in a broad &quot;incoherent background&quot;, corresponding to the strong effects of interactions on the fermions at short time scales.

===Distribution===
The distribution of particles (as opposed to quasiparticles) over momentum states at zero temperature still shows a discontinuous jump at the Fermi surface (as in the Fermi gas), but it does not drop from 1 to 0: the step is only of size formula_26.

===Electrical resistivity===
In a metal the resistivity at low temperatures is dominated by electron–electron scattering in combination with umklapp scattering. For a Fermi liquid, the resistivity from this mechanism varies as formula_27, which is often taken as an experimental check for Fermi liquid behaviour (in addition to the linear temperature-dependence of the specific heat), although it only arises in combination with the lattice. In certain cases, umklapp scattering is not required. For example, the resistivity of compensated semimetals scales as formula_27 because of mutual scattering of electron and hole. This is known as the Baber mechanism.

===Optical response===
Fermi liquid theory predicts that the scattering rate, which governs the optical response of metals, not only depends quadratically on temperature (thus causing the formula_27 dependence of the DC resistance), but it also depends quadratically on frequency. This is in contrast to the Drude prediction for non-interacting metallic electrons, where the scattering rate is a constant as a function of frequency.
One material in which optical Fermi liquid behavior was experimentally observed is the low-temperature metallic phase of Sr2RuO4.

==Instabilities==

The experimental observation of exotic phases in strongly correlated systems has triggered an enormous effort from the theoretical community to try to understand their microscopic origin. One possible route to detect instabilities of a Fermi liquid is precisely the analysis done by Isaak Pomeranchuk. Due to that, the Pomeranchuk instability has been studied by several authors with different techniques in the last few years and in particular, the instability of the Fermi liquid towards the nematic phase was investigated for several models.

==Non-Fermi liquids==
Non-Fermi liquids are systems in which the Fermi-liquid behaviour breaks down. The simplest example is a system of interacting fermions in one dimension, called the Luttinger liquid. Although Luttinger liquids are physically similar to Fermi liquids, the restriction to one dimension gives rise to several qualitative differences such as the absence of a &quot;quasiparticle peak&quot; in the momentum dependent spectral function, and the presence of spin-charge separation and of spin-density waves. One cannot ignore the existence of interactions in one dimension and has to describe the problem with a non-Fermi theory, where Luttinger liquid is one of them. At small finite spin temperatures in one dimension the ground state of the system is described by spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid (SILL).

Another example of non-Fermi-liquid behaviour is observed at quantum critical points of certain second-order phase transitions, such as heavy fermion criticality, Mott criticality and high-formula_30 cuprate phase transitions. The ground state of such transitions is characterized by the presence of a sharp Fermi surface, although there may not be well-defined quasiparticles. That is, on approaching the critical point, it is observed that the quasiparticle residue formula_31.

In optimally doped cuprates and iron-based superconductors, the normal state above the critical temperature shows signs of non-Fermi liquid behaviour, and is often called a strange metal. In this region of phase diagram, resistivity increases linearly in temperature and the Hall coefficient is found to depend on temperature.

Understanding the behaviour of non-Fermi liquids is an important problem in condensed matter physics. Approaches towards explaining these phenomena include the treatment of &quot;marginal Fermi liquids&quot;; attempts to understand critical points and derive scaling relations; and descriptions using &quot;emergent&quot; gauge theories with techniques of holographic gauge/gravity duality.

<text>David John Matthews (born January 9, 1967) is an American musician and the lead vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist for the Dave Matthews Band (DMB). Matthews was born in Johannesburg, and moved frequently between South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States while growing up. He started playing acoustic guitar at the age of nine.

From 1991 to 2003, Matthews predominantly focused on songwriting and performing with the Dave Matthews Band, which he started in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1991. He also has done various solo performances and produced other records. During the period from 2000 to 2010, his band toured constantly, selling more tickets and earning more money than any other act in North America. The band&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Away from the World&quot; made them the only group to have six consecutive studio albums debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. This record was extended to seven consecutive number one albums with the 2018 release, &quot;Come Tomorrow.&quot;

In addition to music, Matthews has had multiple acting roles. He has also won two Grammy Awards: one with the Dave Matthews Band in 1997 for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group (&quot;So Much to Say&quot;) and one in 2004 for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance (&quot;Gravedigger&quot;) from his solo album.

==Early life==
David John Matthews was born on January 9, 1967 in Johannesburg, the third of four children born to South African parents, John and Val Matthews. At age two, Matthews moved with his family to Yorktown Heights, New York, where his father, a physicist, started working for IBM.

In 1974, the Matthews family moved to Cambridge, England, for a year, then returned to New York, where his father died from lung cancer in 1977 when Matthews was ten years old. At some point, while residing in New York, Matthews attended his first concert, when his mother took him to a performance by Pete Seeger. The family returned to Johannesburg in 1977.

Matthews naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1980.

Upon Matthews&#x27;s graduation from secondary school in 1985, he was faced with conscription into the South African military just as civil disobedience to the practice was becoming widespread. As a Quaker (and consequently pacifist), Matthews left South Africa to avoid service.

Matthews moved to New York in 1986 where he worked for IBM for a short time, then joined his mother that same year in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town Matthews&#x27;s family had lived in before he was born. In Charlottesville, he became part of the local music community, rehearsing in a warehouse owned by Roulhac Toledano. Although Matthews had started playing the guitar at age nine, it was only in Charlottesville that he started performing publicly. Matthews met local star (and future collaborator) Tim Reynolds through mutual friend, Nic Cappon. In time, Reynolds had Matthews join him on stage, and Matthews was persuaded to record some of his own songs. This led to his first professional musical gig at a modern dance performance by the &quot;Miki Liszt Dance Company&quot;, based at McGuffey Art Center in Charlottesville, singing &quot;Meaningful Love&quot;, composed by John D&#x27;earth and Dawn Thompson. In 1991, he hatched the idea to form his own band. Before recording his first demo, Matthews bartended at Miller&#x27;s in Charlottesville.

== Formation of Dave Matthews Band ==

After writing his first few songs, including &quot;I&#x27;ll Back You Up&quot;, &quot;The Song That Jane Likes&quot; and &quot;Recently&quot;, Matthews formed Dave Matthews Band in early 1991 with LeRoi Moore, Carter Beauford, Stefan Lessard, Peter Griesar (who left the band in 1993), and Boyd Tinsley while working at Miller&#x27;s as a bartender. The band&#x27;s first show was on March 14, 1991, as part of a benefit for the Middle East Children&#x27;s Alliance at Trax Nightclub in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Matthews&#x27;s older sister Anne, who lived in South Africa, was murdered by her husband in early 1994. Her husband then died by suicide on or around January 27 of that year. The event had a profound effect on Matthews&#x27;s outlook on life and was referenced in a few of his songs. On January 29, 1994, he performed with Tim Reynolds at the Wetlands in New York, where he dedicated that performance &quot;to her [Anne&#x27;s] memory&quot;. Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;, released later that year, was dedicated to her. Anne Matthews was survived by her two children, and they traveled to the United States following her death. Dave and his younger sister Jane (after whom the Dave Matthews Band song &quot;The Song That Jane Likes&quot; is named) took responsibility for the children&#x27;s upbringing.

== Other musical work==
Matthews focused primarily on songwriting and performances with Dave Matthews Band from 1990 to 2003. The band&#x27;s sound blends acoustic guitar, bass, saxophone, drums and violin. In 1994, DMB signed with RCA Records. Since that period, he has occasionally ventured outside the band in various solo performances and records.
Matthews sang on the track &quot;Sing Along&quot; on Blue Man Group&#x27;s second album &quot;The Complex&quot; in 2003. Later that year he released the solo album &quot;Some Devil&quot;, which went platinum; its single &quot;Gravedigger&quot; won a Grammy Award in 2004. To support the album, Matthews toured with a group of musicians (many of whom performed on &quot;Some Devil&quot;) under the name Dave Matthews &amp; Friends.

Dave often collaborates with banjoist Béla Fleck. Fleck is the frontman and namesake of Béla Fleck and the Flecktones; Matthews appears as guest vocalist with the band on their 1998 release, &quot;Left of Cool&quot;. Both Fleck and the Flecktones&#x27; bassist Victor Wooten have made numerous live appearances and in studio with the Dave Matthews Band. Wooten soloed in the second part of the Daniel Lanois song &quot;The Maker&quot;, and also in &quot;#41&quot; on the 1998 live album &quot;Live in Chicago&quot;. The Flecktones also opened for DMB on several tours. Matthews performed a duet with Emmylou Harris on &quot;My Antonia&quot; on her 2000 album &quot;Red Dirt Girl&quot;. They also appeared together on the musical television show &quot;CMT Crossroads&quot;, where the two performed Matthews&#x27;s &quot;Gravedigger&quot; and the folk song &quot;Long Black Veil&quot;.

Matthews played a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s song &quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot; at the 2010 tribute MusiCares Person of the Year, honoring Young on January 29, 2010.
The Dave Matthews Band opened for the Rolling Stones on their Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997–1998), and Matthews sang &quot;Wild Horses&quot; and &quot;Memory Motel&quot; with Mick Jagger.

==Acting==
Before he was known as a musician, Dave Matthews was an amateur actor, appearing onstage in several productions at Charlottesville&#x27;s Offstage Theatre and Live Arts theater in the early 1990s; the role for which he is best remembered is as a used car salesman in Offstage Theatre&#x27;s &quot;Just Say No,&quot; directed by John Quinn, co-starring Kylie Suture. He played Will Coleman in the 2003 adaptation of the novel &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;. In 2005, he played in &quot;Because of Winn-Dixie&quot; as Otis, a man who works at a pet store and plays guitar.
In 2007, Matthews appeared briefly in the movie &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry&quot;, where he plays a homosexual salesman. In 2008, he appeared in the Adam Sandler movie &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot; as a racist redneck character named James. He also had a significant role in &quot;Lake City&quot; with Sissy Spacek and Troy Garity, in which he portrays the character Red. He was in one movie in 2011: the Adam Sandler/Jennifer Aniston comedy &quot;Just Go with It&quot;.

In 2007, Matthews guest-starred in the medical-drama series &quot;House&quot; in the episode &quot;Half-Wit&quot;. He played a piano-playing musical savant who had the two hemispheres of his brain severed from each other in order to recover from his epilepsy, but at the expense of his musical abilities. Dave had a piano double for the complex pieces, but played the simpler pieces himself. In the season one episode of &quot;House&quot;, &quot;Love Hurts&quot;, the song &quot;Some Devil&quot; can be heard playing at the end. In another episode, one of the tracks from &quot;Stand Up&quot;, &quot;You Might Die Trying&quot; was played in the season five episode, &quot;Not Cancer&quot;.

The fifth time Matthews appeared as musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in November 2009 (which was also the fourth time the Dave Matthews Band appeared on the show), he made an appearance as Ozzy Osbourne in a skit called &quot;The Mellow Show&quot;. Bill Hader impersonated Matthews in the same skit.

Matthews was also a cast member and performer in the popular music documentary &quot;Before the Music Dies&quot;. In 2018, Matthews guest-starred on &quot;Pete the Cat&quot; as the voice of Gustavo&#x27;s father, a platypus.

==Other activities==
In 1999, Matthews purchased more than 10 acres of land in Albemarle County, Virginia, known as Blenheim Farm, to preserve its historical significance. He later decided to plant grapes on the property, since it is located within both the Virginia and Monticello viticultural areas. Blenheim Vineyards was founded in 2000, and currently produces 5,500 cases of wine per year, including its signature Petit Verdot and several special edition wines that have featured unique labels with drawings by Matthews.

In 2011, Matthews collaborated with wine makers Steve Reeder and Sean McKenzie in creating the Dreaming Tree Wines.

In April 2012, Matthews was credited as producer on the documentary &quot;Last Call at the Oasis&quot;, directed by Jessica Yu.

In early 2013, Matthews participated in a jam session at Blade Studios in Shreveport, Louisiana, with Jakob Dylan, Charlie Sexton, Blade studios co-owner Brady Blade, and Sexton&#x27;s brother Will. This led to the formation of a band named The Nauts with Matthews, Dylan, Blade, and the Sexton brothers as members. However, there has been no news regarding an album release since that jam session.

On May 16, 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 quarantine, Matthews appeared streaming on the virtual graduation ceremonies for the University of Virginia. He wished students his best and said &quot;it is now your small opportunity to make the world a better place, as you see fit.&quot; He then sang the song &quot;Singing from the Windows&quot;.

==Personal life==
Dave Matthews married longtime girlfriend Jennifer Ashley Harper in 2000. They have twin daughters born in 2001, and a son born in 2007. They reside in Seattle. In a 2001 interview, Matthews stated that he was agnostic. He joined the Farm Aid board of directors in 2001, to serve alongside fellow musicians Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp and Neil Young to raise money for family farmers in the United States.

===Political activism===
Matthews published an Internet video before the 2000 U.S. presidential election, urging viewers to vote without advocating any candidate. He mentioned only Ralph Nader by name, and updated fans about the recording sessions for &quot;Everyday&quot;. Although his music often explores political and social issues, Matthews refrained from public campaigning for presidential candidates until 2004. He cast his support strongly with Democratic nominee John Kerry, performing at political events including the Vote for Change tour.

Matthews also supported Barack Obama for president in 2008, both in the primaries and in the general election. On April 6, 2008, he and Tim Reynolds played a concert titled &quot;Change Rocks&quot; at Indiana University to encourage students to register to vote. The tickets were distributed by the Obama campaign. Questions regarding his citizenship were answered by advertisements and videos on YouTube, where he says he is a &quot;real American&quot; and a &quot;real Virginian,&quot; stating that &quot;real Virginians get out and vote.&quot; Although bereaved by the loss of band co-founder and saxophonist LeRoi Moore on August 19, 2008, he and Tim Reynolds played for the Democratic National Convention delegates on Sunday, August 24, at Red Rocks, and again with Reynolds at Virginia Commonwealth University on October 26, 2008, among other places. Matthews has often supported environmental initiatives, such as biofuel availability and the fight against global climate change.

On September 21, 2009, Matthews stated that some of President Barack Obama&#x27;s harsher critics were motivated by his race, and stated that he &quot;sees it [racism] everywhere&quot; in the United States. Matthews is also a strong supporter of gay rights and participated in &quot;Love Unites Shepard Fairey Equality Project&quot;, a gay marriage advocacy project.

On May 10, 2012, Matthews entertained a sellout crowd at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle where President Obama was hosting a campaign fundraiser.

In a September 28, 2015, interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Matthews said that &quot;when I hear someone like Bernie Sanders talking, I think there&#x27;s a hope.&quot; Matthews performed at a San Francisco rally for Sanders during the 2016 presidential primaries and later, during the general election campaign. He was a major donor to the 2017 gubernatorial campaign of progressive Charlottesville politician Tom Perriello.

On October 30, 2021, Matthews performed at a Democratic get out the vote event in Charlottesville, Virginia with gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe. During the 2022 election campaign, Matthews performed at campaign events for Democratic candidates Tim Ryan in Ohio and John Fetterman in Pennsylvania.

During a Dave Matthews Band concert in Virginia Beach on June 15, 2024, Matthews paused in the set to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.

<text>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is the principal executive leadership board of the United States&#x27; Democratic Party. According to the party charter, it has &quot;general responsibility for the affairs of the Democratic Party between National Conventions&quot;, and particularly coordinates strategy to support Democratic Party candidates throughout the country for local, state, and national office, as well as works to establish a &quot;party brand&quot; and to formulate the party platform. While it provides support for party candidates, it does not have direct authority over elected officials.

The DNC was established on May 26, 1848, at that year&#x27;s Democratic National Convention. The DNC&#x27;s main counterpart is the Republican National Committee.

==Role==
The DNC is responsible for articulating and promoting the Democratic platform and coordinating party organizational activity. In particular, it organizes and calls for the Democratic National Convention held every four years to nominate candidates for President and Vice President of the United States, and is subsequently responsible for the Presidential campaign. The DNC is more focused on campaign and organizational strategy than public policy. According to Boris Heersink, &quot;political scientists have traditionally described the parties&#x27; national committees as inconsequential but impartial service providers.&quot;

In presidential elections, it supervises the national convention and, both independently and in coordination with the presidential candidate, raises funds, commissions polls, and coordinates campaign strategy. Following the selection of a party nominee, the public funding laws permit the national party to coordinate certain expenditures with the nominee, but additional funds are spent on general, party-building activities. There are state committees in every state, as well as local committees in most cities, wards, and towns (and, in most states, counties).

When the president is a Democrat, the party generally works closely with the president and the White House largely controls the committee.

== Membership and organization ==
The DNC is headed by a chairperson, five vice chairpersons, a treasurer, a secretary, and a national finance chair, who are all elected by vote of members of the Democratic National Committee itself.

According to its charter, the committee is further composed of:

# two representatives (including the chairperson) of each state committee or US territory
# 200 additional members apportioned to the states according to their population size (minimum two per state), elected either on the ballot by primary voters or by the state committee or caucus
# two additional members per US territory, selected by their Democratic parties
# the Democratic leaders in the US Senate and House of Representatives
# three Democratic governors (including the chairperson of the Democratic Governors Association), mayors (including the chairperson of the Democratic Mayors Association), county officials (including the chairperson of the National Democratic County Officials), state legislators (including the chairperson of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee), and municipal officials (including the chairperson of the Democratic Municipal Officials), respectively
# three representatives (including the presidents) of the Young Democrats of America and the National Federation of Democratic Women, respectively
# two representatives (including the chairpersons) of the College Democrats, the Democratic State Treasurers Association, the Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association, the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State, the Democratic Attorneys General Association, the National Democratic Ethnic Coordinating Committee, the National Democratic Seniors Coordinating Council, and the High School Democrats of America, respectively
# eight representatives of the Democrats Abroad (including the chairperson), who each have half a vote
# up to 75 additional members elected by the committee.

All DNC members are superdelegates to the Democratic National Convention, and their role can affect the outcome over a close primary race only if no candidate receives a majority of pledged delegates. These delegates, officially described as &quot;unpledged party leader and elected official delegates,&quot; fall into three categories based on other positions they hold:
* elected members of the Democratic National Committee,
* sitting Democratic governors and members of Congress, and
* distinguished party leaders, consisting of current and former presidents, vice presidents, congressional leaders, and DNC chairs, are all superdelegates for life.
The DNC establishes rules for the caucuses and primaries which choose delegates to the Democratic National Convention, but the caucuses and primaries themselves are most often run not by the DNC but instead by each individual state. Primary elections, in particular, are conducted by state governments according to their own laws. Political parties can choose whether to participate and accept the results of a state&#x27;s primary election.

An internal organization, the Association of State Democratic Chairs (ASDC), convenes the state and territorial party chairs and vice chairs. The president of the ASDC serves concurrently as a vice chair of the DNC. Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party since 2016, was elected in 2025 as president of the ASDC, succeeding Ken Martin who had served as president since 2017. The ASDC is assisted by the Association of State Democratic Executive Directors (ASDED), headed by Brad Martin (executive director of the Democratic Party of Oregon) since 2017. 

The DNC convenes at least once a year. An &quot;Executive Committee&quot; of roughly 65 members determined by the DNC is responsible for the affairs of the party and meets at least quarterly. In addition, a National Advisory Board exists for purposes of fundraising and advising the executive. The present chair is Elizabeth Frawley Bagley, U.S. Ambassador to Brazil.

=== Current leadership ===
Ken Martin, former chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, was elected chair in the 2025 chairmanship election on February 1, 2025.

Furthermore, the following non-voting officers execute administrative tasks within the DNC:
* Executive Director: Sam Cornale, former chief of staff of the Democratic National Committee
* Deputy Executive Director: Roger Lau, former campaign manager for Elizabeth Warren for President
* Political Director: Alana Mounce, former executive director of the Nevada State Democratic Party
* Chief of Staff: Anatole Jenkins, former national organizing director for Kamala Harris For The People

== List of DNC leaders ==

===Chairs===

===Deputy chairs===
This is an inactive position.

The deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee was re-established by Tom Perez in February 2017 after his win in the 2017 DNC Chair race.

After a close victory over Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, Perez appointed Ellison as deputy chair in an attempt to lessen the divide in the Democratic Party after the contentious 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, which saw conflicts between supporters of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Perez was seen as being more in line with the Clinton wing, while Ellison was more in line with the Sanders wing. The role&#x27;s revival in 2017 has been described by critics as largely titular and ceremonial.

On November 8, 2018, Ellison resigned from the position due to his win in the Minnesota Attorney General election. The position remains unoccupied.
===Treasurers===

== History ==
The DNC has existed since 1848. During the 1848 Democratic National Convention, a resolution was passed creating the Democratic National Committee, composed of thirty members, one person per state, chosen by the states&#x27; delegations, and chaired by Benjamin F. Hallett.

In order to strengthen the national party organization, Franklin Roosevelt proposed in 1925 that the DNC should open a permanent headquarters in order to function &quot;every day in every year&quot; and exist on a &quot;business-like financial basis.&quot; In 1929, John Raskob led the creation of the first permanent national headquarters for the DNC in Washington, DC.

=== Watergate ===

In the 1970s, the DNC had its head office, located in the Watergate complex at the time, burglarized by entities working for Richard Nixon&#x27;s administration during the Watergate scandal.

=== Chinagate ===

Chinagate was an alleged effort by the People&#x27;s Republic of China to influence domestic American politics prior to and during the Clinton administration. In 2002, the Federal Election Commission fined the Democratic National Committee $115,000 for its part in fundraising violations in 1996.

=== Cyber attacks ===
Cyber attacks and hacks were claimed by or attributed to various individual and groups such as:
* According to committee officials and security experts, two competing Russian intelligence services were discovered on DNC computer networks. One intelligence service achieved infiltration beginning in the summer of 2015 and the other service breached and roamed the network beginning in April 2016. The two groups accessed emails, chats, and research on an opposing presidential candidate. They were expelled from the DNC system in June 2016.
* The hacker Guccifer 2.0 claimed that he hacked into the Democratic National Committee computer network and then leaked its emails to the newspaper &quot;The Hill&quot;. During a CNN interview with Jake Tapper, Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign manager, Robby Mook, cited experts saying that the DNC emails were leaked by the Russians but did not name the experts. The press and cybersecurity firms discredited the Guccifer 2.0 claim, as investigators now believe Guccifer 2.0 was an agent of the G.R.U., Russia&#x27;s military intelligence service.

===2016 email leak===
On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released approximately 20,000 DNC emails. Critics claimed that the Committee unequally favored Hillary Clinton and acted in support of her nomination while opposing the candidacy of her primary challenger Bernie Sanders. Donna Brazile corroborated these allegations in an excerpt of her book published by &quot;Politico&quot; in November 2017. The leaked emails spanned sixteen months, terminating in May 2016.

The WikiLeaks releases led to the resignations of Chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Communications Director Luis Miranda, Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall and Chief Executive Amy Dacey. After she resigned, Wasserman Schultz put out a statement about possible FBI assistance in investigating the hacking and leaks, saying that &quot;the DNC was never contacted by the FBI or any other agency concerned about these intrusions.&quot; During a Senate hearing in January 2017, James Comey testified that the FBI requested access to the DNC&#x27;s servers, but its request was denied. He also testified that old versions of the Republican National Committee&#x27;s servers were breached, but then-current databases were unaffected.

The DNC subsequently filed a lawsuit in federal court against WikiLeaks and others alleging a conspiracy to influence the election.

<doc id="182451" wikidata="Q408032" url="?curid=182451" title="Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid">
<text>Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), also called EDTA acid, is an aminopolycarboxylic acid with the formula [CH2N(CH2CO2H)2]2. This white, slightly water-soluble solid is widely used to bind to iron (Fe2+/Fe3+) and calcium ions (Ca2+), forming water-soluble complexes even at neutral pH. It is thus used to dissolve Fe- and Ca-containing scale as well as to deliver iron ions under conditions where its oxides are insoluble. EDTA is available as several salts, notably disodium EDTA, sodium calcium edetate, and tetrasodium EDTA, but these all function similarly.

==Uses==
EDTA is widely used in industry. It also has applications in food preservation, medicine, cosmetics, water softening, in laboratories, and other fields.

=== Industrial ===
EDTA is mainly used to sequester (bind or confine) metal ions in aqueous solution. In the textile industry, it prevents metal ion impurities from modifying colours of dyed products. In the pulp and paper industry, EDTA inhibits the ability of metal ions, especially Mn2+, from catalysing the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide, which is used in chlorine-free bleaching.

==== Gas scrubbing ====
Aqueous [Fe(EDTA)]− is used for removing (&quot;scrubbing&quot;) hydrogen sulfide from gas streams. This conversion is achieved by oxidising the hydrogen sulfide to elemental sulfur, which is non-volatile:
:2 [Fe(EDTA)]− + H2S → 2 [Fe(EDTA)]2− + S + 2 H+
In this application, the iron(III) centre is reduced to its iron(II) derivative, which can then be reoxidised by air. In a similar manner, nitrogen oxides are removed from gas streams using [Fe(EDTA)]2−.

=== Food ===
In a similar manner, EDTA is added to some food as a preservative or stabiliser to prevent catalytic oxidative decolouration, which is catalysed by metal ions.

=== Water softener ===
The reduction of water hardness in laundry applications and the dissolution of scale in boilers both rely on EDTA and related complexants to bind Ca2+, Mg2+, as well as other metal ions. Once bound to EDTA, these metal complexes are less likely to form precipitates or to interfere with the action of the soaps and detergents. For similar reasons, cleaning solutions often contain EDTA. In a similar manner EDTA is used in the cement industry for the determination of free lime and free magnesia in cement and clinkers.

The solvation of Fe3+ ions at or below near neutral pH can be accomplished using EDTA. This property is useful in agriculture including hydroponics. However, given the pH dependence of ligand formation, EDTA is not helpful for improving iron solubility in above neutral soils. Otherwise, at near-neutral pH and above, iron(III) forms insoluble salts, which are less bioavailable to susceptible plant species.

=== Ion-exchange chromatography ===
EDTA was used in separation of the lanthanide metals by ion-exchange chromatography. Perfected by F. H. Spedding &quot;et al&quot;. in 1954, the method relies on the steady increase in stability constant of the lanthanide EDTA complexes with atomic number. Using sulfonated polystyrene beads and Cu2+ as a retaining ion, EDTA causes the lanthanides to migrate down the column of resin while separating into bands of pure lanthanides. The lanthanides elute in order of decreasing atomic number. Due to the expense of this method, relative to countercurrent solvent extraction, ion exchange is now used only to obtain the highest purities of lanthanides (typically greater than 99.99%).

===Medicine===
Sodium calcium edetate, an EDTA derivative, is used to bind metal ions in the practice of chelation therapy, such as for treating mercury and lead poisoning. It is used in a similar manner to remove excess iron from the body. This therapy is used to treat the complication of repeated blood transfusions, as would be applied to treat thalassaemia.

==== In testing ====
In medical diagnosis and organ function tests (here, kidney function test), the chromium(III) complex [Cr(EDTA)]− (as radioactive chromium-51 (51Cr)) is administered intravenously and its filtration into the urine is monitored. This method is useful for evaluating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in nuclear medicine.

EDTA is used extensively in the analysis of blood. It is an anticoagulant for blood samples for CBC/FBCs, where the EDTA chelates the calcium present in the blood specimen, arresting the coagulation process and preserving blood cell morphology. Tubes containing EDTA are marked with lavender (purple) or pink tops. EDTA is also in tan top tubes for lead testing and can be used in royal blue top tubes for trace metal testing.

EDTA is a slime dispersant, and has been found to be highly effective in reducing bacterial growth during implantation of intraocular lenses (IOLs).

==== Dentistry ====
Dentists and endodontists use EDTA solutions to remove inorganic debris (smear layer) and lubricate the root canals in endodontics. This procedure helps prepare root canals for obturation. Furthermore, EDTA solutions with the addition of a surfactant loosen up calcifications inside a root canal and allow instrumentation (canal shaping) and facilitate apical advancement of a file in a tight or calcified root canal towards the apex.

==== Eyedrops ====
It serves as a preservative (usually to enhance the action of another preservative such as benzalkonium chloride or thiomersal) in ocular preparations and eyedrops.

===Alternative medicine===
Some alternative practitioners believe EDTA acts as an antioxidant, preventing free radicals from injuring blood vessel walls, therefore reducing atherosclerosis. These ideas are unsupported by scientific studies, and seem to contradict some currently accepted principles. The U.S. FDA has not approved it for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

===Cosmetics===
In shampoos, cleaners, and other personal care products, EDTA salts are used as a sequestering agent to improve their stability in air.

===Laboratory applications===
In the laboratory, EDTA is widely used for scavenging metal ions: In biochemistry and molecular biology, ion depletion is commonly used to deactivate metal-dependent enzymes, either as an assay for their reactivity or to suppress damage to DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides. EDTA also acts as a selective inhibitor against dNTP hydrolyzing enzymes (Taq polymerase, dUTPase, MutT), liver arginase and horseradish peroxidase independently of metal ion chelation. These findings urge the rethinking of the utilisation of EDTA as a biochemically inactive metal ion scavenger in enzymatic experiments. In analytical chemistry, EDTA is used in complexometric titrations and analysis of water hardness or as a masking agent to sequester metal ions that would interfere with the analyses.

EDTA finds many specialised uses in the biomedical labs, such as in veterinary ophthalmology as an anticollagenase to prevent the worsening of corneal ulcers in animals. In tissue culture, EDTA is used as a chelating agent that binds to calcium and prevents joining of cadherins between cells, preventing clumping of cells grown in liquid suspension, or detaching adherent cells for passaging. In histopathology, EDTA can be used as a decalcifying agent making it possible to cut sections using a microtome once the tissue sample is demineralised.

EDTA is also known to inhibit a range of metallopeptidases, the method of inhibition occurs via the chelation of the metal ion required for catalytic activity. EDTA can also be used to test for bioavailability of heavy metals in sediments. However, it may &quot;influence&quot; the bioavailability of metals in solution, which may pose concerns regarding its effects in the environment, especially given its widespread uses and applications.

===Other===
The oxidising properties of [Fe(EDTA)]− are used in photography to solubilise silver particles.

EDTA is also used to remove crud (corroded metals) from fuel rods in nuclear reactors.

==Side effects==
EDTA exhibits low acute toxicity with (rat) of 2.0 g/kg to 2.2 g/kg. It has been found to be both cytotoxic and weakly genotoxic in laboratory animals. Oral exposures have been noted to cause reproductive and developmental effects. The same study also found that both dermal exposure to EDTA in most cosmetic formulations and inhalation exposure to EDTA in aerosolised cosmetic formulations would produce exposure levels below those seen to be toxic in oral dosing studies.

==Synthesis==

The compound was first described in 1935 by Ferdinand Münz, who prepared the compound from ethylenediamine and chloroacetic acid. Today, EDTA is mainly synthesised from ethylenediamine (1,2-diaminoethane), formaldehyde, and sodium cyanide. This route yields the tetrasodium EDTA, which is converted in a subsequent step into the acid forms:

:H2NCH2CH2NH2 + 4 CH2O + 4 NaCN + 4 H2O → (NaO2CCH2)2NCH2CH2N(CH2CO2Na)2 + 4 NH3

:(NaO2CCH2)2NCH2CH2N(CH2CO2Na)2 + 4 HCl → (HO2CCH2)2NCH2CH2N(CH2CO2H)2 + 4 NaCl

This process is used to produce about 80,000 tonnes of EDTA each year. Impurities cogenerated by this route include glycine and nitrilotriacetic acid; they arise from reactions of the ammonia coproduct.

==Nomenclature==
To describe EDTA and its various protonated forms, chemists distinguish between EDTA4−, the conjugate base that is the ligand, and H4EDTA, the precursor to that ligand. At very low pH (very acidic conditions) the fully protonated H6EDTA2+ form predominates, whereas at very high pH or very basic condition, the fully deprotonated EDTA4− form is prevalent. In this article, the term EDTA is used to mean H4−&quot;x&quot;EDTA&quot;x&quot;−, whereas in its complexes EDTA4− stands for the tetraanion ligand.

==Coordination chemistry principles==
In coordination chemistry, EDTA4− is a member of the aminopolycarboxylic acid family of ligands. EDTA4− usually binds to a metal cation through its two amines and four carboxylates, i.e., it is a hexadentate (&quot;six-toothed&quot;) chelating agent. Many of the resulting coordination compounds adopt octahedral geometry. Although of little consequence for its applications, these octahedral complexes are chiral. The cobalt(III) anion [Co(EDTA)]− has been resolved into enantiomers. Many complexes of EDTA4− adopt more complex structures due to either the formation of an additional bond to water, &quot;i.e.&quot; seven-coordinate complexes, or the displacement of one carboxylate arm by water. The iron(III) complex of EDTA is seven-coordinate. Early work on the development of EDTA was undertaken by Gerold Schwarzenbach in the 1940s. EDTA forms especially strong complexes with Mn(II), Cu(II), Fe(III), Pb(II) and Co(III).

Several features of EDTA&#x27;s complexes are relevant to its applications. First, because of its high denticity, this ligand has a high affinity for metal cations:

:[Fe(H2O)6]3+ + H4EDTA [Fe(EDTA)]− + 6 H2O + 4 H+ &quot;K&quot;eq = 1025.1

Written in this way, the equilibrium quotient shows that metal ions compete with protons for binding to EDTA. Because metal ions are extensively enveloped by EDTA, their catalytic properties are often suppressed. Finally, since complexes of EDTA4− are anionic, they tend to be highly soluble in water. For this reason, EDTA is able to dissolve deposits of metal oxides and carbonates.

The p&quot;K&quot;a values of free EDTA are 0, 1.5, 2, 2.66 (deprotonation of the four carboxyl groups) and 6.16, 10.24 (deprotonation of the two amino groups).

==Environmental concerns==

===Abiotic degradation===
EDTA is in such widespread use that questions have been raised whether it is a persistent organic pollutant. While EDTA serves many positive functions in different industrial, pharmaceutical and other avenues, the longevity of EDTA can pose serious issues in the environment. The degradation of EDTA is slow. It mainly occurs abiotically in the presence of sunlight.

The most important process for the elimination of EDTA from surface waters is direct photolysis at wavelengths below 400 nm. Depending on the light conditions, the photolysis half-lives of iron(III) EDTA in surface waters can range as low as 11.3 minutes up to more than 100 hours. Degradation of FeEDTA, but not EDTA itself, produces iron complexes of the triacetate (ED3A), diacetate (EDDA), and monoacetate (EDMA) – 92% of EDDA and EDMA biodegrades in 20 hours while ED3A displays significantly higher resistance. Many environmentally-abundant EDTA species (such as Mg2+ and Ca2+) are more persistent.

===Biodegradation===
In many industrial wastewater treatment plants, EDTA elimination can be achieved at about 80% using microorganisms. Resulting byproducts are ED3A and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) – suggesting that both the backbone and acetyl groups were attacked. Some microorganisms have even been discovered to form nitrates out of EDTA, but they function optimally at moderately alkaline conditions of pH 9.0–9.5.

Several bacterial strains isolated from sewage treatment plants efficiently degrade EDTA. Specific strains include &quot;Agrobacterium radiobacter&quot; ATCC 55002 and the sub-branches of Pseudomonadota like BNC1, BNC2, and strain DSM 9103. The three strains share similar properties of aerobic respiration and are classified as gram-negative bacteria. Unlike photolysis, the chelated species is not exclusive to iron(III) in order to be degraded. Rather, each strain uniquely consumes varying metal–EDTA complexes through several enzymatic pathways. Agrobacterium radiobacter only degrades Fe(III) EDTA while BNC1 and DSM 9103 are not capable of degrading iron(III) EDTA and are more suited for calcium, barium, magnesium and manganese(II) complexes. EDTA complexes require dissociation before degradation.

==Alternatives to EDTA==
Interest in environmental safety has raised concerns about biodegradability of aminopolycarboxylates such as EDTA. These concerns incentivize the investigation of alternative aminopolycarboxylates. Candidate chelating agents include nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), iminodisuccinic acid (IDS), polyaspartic acid, &quot;S,S&quot;-ethylenediamine-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;′-disuccinic acid (EDDS), methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA), and -Glutamic acid &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-diacetic acid, tetrasodium salt (GLDA).

===Iminodisuccinic acid (IDS)===
Commercially used since 1998, iminodisuccinic acid (IDS) biodegrades by about 80% after only 7 days. IDS binds to calcium exceptionally well and forms stable compounds with other heavy metal ions. In addition to having a lower toxicity after chelation, IDS is degraded by &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; (BY6), which can be harvested on a large scale. The enzymes involved, IDS epimerase and C−N lyase, do not require any cofactors.

===Polyaspartic acid===
Polyaspartic acid, like IDS, binds to calcium and other heavy metal ions. It has many practical applications including corrosion inhibitors, wastewater additives, and agricultural polymers. A Polyaspartic acid-based laundry detergent was the first laundry detergent in the world to receive the EU flower ecolabel. Calcium binding ability of polyaspartic acid has been exploited for targeting of drug-loaded nanocarriers to bone. Preparation of hydrogels based on polyaspartic acid, in a variety of physical forms ranging from fiber to particle, can potentially enable facile separation of the chelated ions from a solution. Therefore, despite being weaker than EDTA, polyaspartic acid can still be regarded as a viable alternative due to these features as well as biocompatibility, and biodegradability.

===&quot;S&quot;,&quot;S&quot;-Ethylenediamine-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;′-disuccinic acid (EDDS)===
A structural isomer of EDTA, ethylenediamine-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;′-disuccinic acid (EDDS) is readily biodegradable at high rate in its &quot;S&quot;,&quot;S&quot; form.

===Methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA)===
Trisodium dicarboxymethyl alaninate, also known as methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA), has a high rate of biodegradation at over 68%, but unlike many other chelating agents can degrade without the assistance of adapted bacteria. Additionally, unlike EDDS or IDS, MGDA can withstand higher temperatures while maintaining a high stability as well as the entire pH range. MGDA has been shown to be an effective chelating agent, with a capacity for mobilization comparable with that of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), with application to water for industrial use and for the removal of calcium oxalate from urine from patients with kidney stones.

==Methods of detection and analysis==
The most sensitive method of detecting and measuring EDTA in biological samples is selected reaction monitoring capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (SRM-CE/MS), which has a detection limit of 7.3 ng/mL in human plasma and a quantitation limit of 15 ng/mL. This method works with sample volumes as small as 7–8 nL.

EDTA has also been measured in non-alcoholic beverages using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at a level of 2.0 μg/mL.

== In popular culture ==

In the movie &quot;Blade&quot; (1998), EDTA is used as a weapon to kill vampires, exploding when in contact with vampire blood.

Blood on the sock that was used as evidence against O. J. Simpson, in the killing of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, had high levels of EDTA, according to defense attorneys.

<text>Hochsauerlandkreis (meaning “High Sauerland District” in German) is a (district) in the east of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Soest, Paderborn, Höxter, Waldeck-Frankenberg, Siegen-Wittgenstein, Olpe, Märkischer Kreis.

The district is named “High Sauerland” because two of the highest mountains of the Sauerland mountainous landscape, Langenberg and Kahler Asten are in its territory. With 2,766 ft / 843 m (Langenberg) and 2,762 ft / 842 m (Kahler Asten) these are also the highest mountains of North Rhine-Westphalia.

== History ==
The district was established in 1975 in the reorganization of the districts in North Rhine-Westphalia by merging the previous districts Arnsberg, Brilon and Meschede.

== Geography ==
Geographically the district covers a big part of the Sauerland mountains, including the highest and third highest elevation – the Langenberg near Olsberg with 2,766 ft / 843 m, and the better known Kahler Asten with 2,762 ft / 842 m near Winterberg. These are also the two highest mountains of North Rhine-Westphalia.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms was inherited from the former district Arnsberg. It shows the eagle as the symbol of the Earls of Arnsberg. When their county lost independence in 1368 it fell to the bishops of Cologne, thus the sign on the breast of the eagle shows the Cologne cross.

== Towns and municipalities ==

== Town twinnings ==
Hochsauerland is twinned with the following areas:

* West Lothian, Scotland

==Notable persons==
*Franz Hoffmeister (died 1943), Roman Catholic priest
*Friedrich Merz, current leader of the CDU

==Notable places==
*Abbey Bergkloster, Bestwig 
*Abbey Grafschaft, Schmallenberg
*Abbey Königsmünster, Meschede

<doc id="182455" wikidata="Q120384" url="?curid=182455" title="Corrin">
<text>Corrin is a heterocyclic compound. Although not known to exist on its own, the molecule is of interest as the parent macrocycle related to the cofactor and chromophore in vitamin B12. Its name reflects that it is the &quot;core&quot; of vitamin B12 (cobalamins). Compounds with a corrin core are known as &quot;corrins&quot;.

There are two chiral centres, which in natural compounds like cobalamin have the same stereochemistry.

==Coordination chemistry==

Upon deprotonation, the corrinoid ring is capable of binding cobalt. In vitamin B12, the resulting complex also features a benzimidazole-derived ligand, and the sixth site on the octahedron serves as the catalytic center.

The corrin ring resembles the porphyrin ring. Both feature four pyrrole-like subunits organized into rings. Corrins have a central 15-membered ring whereas porphryins have an interior 16-membered ring. All four nitrogen centers are linked by conjugation structure, with alternating double and single bonds. In contrast to porphyrins, corrins lack one of the carbon groups that link the pyrrole-like units into a fully conjugated structure. With a conjugated system that extends only 3/4 of the way around the ring, and does not include any of the outer edge carbons, corrins have a number of non-conjugated sp3 carbons, making them more flexible than porphyrins and not as flat. A third closely related biological structure, the chlorin ring system found in chlorophyll, is intermediate between porphyrin and corrin, having 20 carbons like the porphyrins and a conjugated structure extending all the way around the central atom, but with only 6 of the 8 edge carbons participating.
Corroles (octadehydrocorrins) are fully aromatic derivatives of corrins.

<doc id="182456" wikidata="Q465632" url="?curid=182456" title="Frankie Valli">
<text>Francesco Stephen Castelluccio (born May 3, 1934), better known by his stage name Frankie Valli, is an American singer and occasional actor, best known as the frontman (lead singer) of the Four Seasons. He is known for his unusually powerful lead falsetto voice.

Valli scored 29 top 40 hits with the Four Seasons, one top 40 hit under the Four Seasons alias the Wonder Who?, and nine top 40 hits as a solo artist. As a member of the Four Seasons, Valli&#x27;s number-one hits include &quot;Sherry&quot; (1962), &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (1962), &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot; (1963), &quot;Rag Doll&quot; (1964) and &quot;December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)&quot; (1975). Valli&#x27;s recording of the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; reached number two in 1967. As a solo artist, Valli scored number-one hits with the songs &quot;My Eyes Adored You&quot; (1974) and &quot;Grease&quot; (1978).

Valli, Tommy DeVito, Nick Massi and Bob Gaudio—the original members of the Four Seasons—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 and the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. Valli is also a 2010 inductee of the New Jersey Hall of Fame, with the Four Seasons (Gaudio, Massi, DeVito and Joe Long) inducted separately in 2017 and Valli speaking on Massi&#x27;s behalf. Valli was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2024, a joint star for both himself and the Four Seasons, with Valli appearing in person to accept the honor with his wife and two of his sons, and Gaudio sending a prerecorded acceptance speech.In February 2025, Valli was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, this being his first and only Grammy.

== Early life ==
Valli was born Francesco Stephen Castelluccio, on May 3, 1934, to an Italian family in the First Ward of Newark, New Jersey; he is the eldest of three sons. His father, Antonio (Anthony) Castelluccio, who had immigrated to the U.S. from Faiano, Salerno, Campania, was a barber and display designer for Lionel model trains; his mother, Mary Rinaldi, who was from Avellino, Campania, was a homemaker and beer company employee. He was inspired to take up a singing career at age seven after his mother took him to see Frank Sinatra at the Paramount Theater in New York City. One of his early favorite singers was &quot;Texas&quot; Jean Valli, from whom he took his stage name. He worked as a barber until he could support himself with music.

Valli&#x27;s birth year has been called into question. He never addressed the issue himself until a 2007 posting at the Official Frankie Valli Site, sponsored by his record label Universal Records. Much of his previous official publicity used 1937 as his birth year. Other sources gave his year of birth as 1934, such as the Bear Family Records release &quot;The Four Lovers&quot; (BCD 15424) and a 1965 mug shot, available through The Smoking Gun.

== Music career ==
Valli began his singing career in 1951 with the Variety Trio (Nickie DeVito, Tommy DeVito, and Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Majewski), and was mentored in much of his early career by Nick Macioci, who later joined Valli in The Four Seasons, and by &quot;Texas&quot; Jean Valli, a female hillbilly singer, from whom he adopted the &quot;Valli&quot; surname. Geoff Herbert explains, &quot;Frankie said in 2010 that Jean took him to meet music publishers Paul and Dave Kapp, telling them he was her brother. As a result, his first single was listed under &#x27;Frankie Valley&#x27;, and the name stuck—though he eventually changed it to the same spelling&quot; that Texas Jean used. His desire to sing in public was initially granted when the group offered him a guest spot when they performed. In late 1952, the Variety Trio disbanded and Valli and Tommy DeVito became part of the house band at The Strand in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Valli played bass and sang.

Valli recorded his first single, &quot;My Mother&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, in 1953, a cover of the 1929 George Jessel song from &quot;Lucky Boy&quot;, with his stage name &quot;Frankie Valley.&quot; Around this time, Valli, Majewski and Tommy DeVito left the house band at The Strand and formed The Variatones with Frank Cottone and Billy Thompson. In 1956, the group impressed New York recording agent Peter Paul, and he got them an audition at RCA Victor a week later.

The group changed its name to the Four Lovers and recorded several singles and an album&#x27;s worth of tracks. They had a minor hit with &quot;You&#x27;re the Apple of My Eye&quot; in 1956, which earned them their first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. After two years of no further success, DeVito fired his brother and Majewski for insubordination (they had refused to take a gig opening for Tony Bennett) and creative differences, as Majewski&#x27;s comic persona did not mesh with the group&#x27;s musical talents. The Four Lovers continued, with Valli, DeVito and an &quot;ad hoc&quot; lineup that variously included Macioci (by then also pursuing a solo career as &quot;Nickie Massey&quot;), Charles Calello and Hollywood Playboys keyboardist Hugh Garrity. In 1959, after being introduced at a gig in Baltimore by mutual friend Joe Pesci, Royal Teen Bob Gaudio became a member. By 1960, after several years of session work under numerous stage names, the lineup of Valli, DeVito, Gaudio and a now-renamed Nick Massi took on the name &quot;The 4 Seasons,&quot; taking the name from a bowling alley in Union, New Jersey that had rejected them after an audition. 

As the lead singer of the Four Seasons, Valli had a string of hits, beginning with the number-one hit &quot;Sherry&quot; in 1962 and continuing through most of the rest of the decade.

During the 1960s, Gaudio and his songwriting partner Bob Crewe worked with Valli to craft solo recordings, with varying degrees of success. It was rare at the time for a major recording artist to perform solo while still recording with their own group. Valli&#x27;s debut solo album was a collection of single releases and a few new recordings. He used the opportunity to transition away from the power falsetto that had made Valli and the Four Seasons famous, singing in a natural tenor voice. (Calello noted in 2000 that Valli&#x27;s voice could go down to a baritone and that Valli would take on the baritone parts in harmony arrangements when he did not sing lead.)

&quot;You&#x27;re Ready Now&quot;, a Valli solo recording from 1966, became part of the Northern soul scene and reached number eleven on the UK Singles Chart in December 1970. &quot;The Night&quot; originally released in 1970 also became a huge Northern soul hit and as a result it reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart in 1975.

In 1975, his single &quot;My Eyes Adored You&quot; hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached number 5 in the UK chart. This caused an awkward situation within the band, as Valli&#x27;s label at the time, Private Stock Records, was willing to sign Valli but not the band. Warner Bros. Records was willing to sign the band, but greatly preferred if someone other than Valli sang lead vocals. As part of that agreement, Valli—with great reluctance—ceded some of the lead vocals for the group to new band members Gerry Polci and, to a lesser extent, Don Ciccone. In the same year, he also had a number six &quot;Billboard&quot; hit with the disco-laden &quot;Swearin&#x27; to God&quot; reaching number 31 in the UK chart, while further UK chart success came with &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, written by Guy Fletcher and Doug Flett. Valli was in the UK charts, reaching number 11. Meanwhile, the Four Seasons had a string of hits from their new LP &quot;Who Loves You&quot; in 1975; the title track with Valli, &quot;December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)&quot; with Valli, Polci and Ciccone, and minor hits &quot;Silver Star&quot; and &quot;Down the Hall&quot; (the latter from the follow-up album &quot;Helicon&quot;) with Polci alone. In 1976, Valli covered the Beatles song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; for the ephemeral musical documentary &quot;All This and World War II&quot;, to which the Seasons also contributed a cover of &quot;We Can Work It Out.&quot;

In 1978, with the Four Seasons temporarily broken up, Valli embarked on a solo tour and sang the theme song for the film version of the stage play &quot;Grease&quot;, a song by Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees, which became a number one hit. He had two further chart successes over the next year: &quot;Save Me, Save Me&quot; in November 1978, which entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Easy Listening chart, and &quot;Fancy Dancer&quot; in January 1979, which entered the pop charts.

Valli began suffering from otosclerosis in 1967, forcing him to &quot;sing from memory&quot; in the latter part of the 1970s. Surgery performed by Victor Goodhill, a Los Angeles ear specialist, restored most of his hearing by 1980.

In 2005, the musical &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; opened on Broadway. Besides performances of many of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons hit recordings, it has a biographical narrative, told from four separate points of view by each member of the Four Seasons (DeVito, Valli, Massi and Gaudio). John Lloyd Young portrayed Valli in the original production, while West End&#x27;s production Ryan Molloy is the &quot;longest-serving Frankie Valli&quot;. The musical dramatizes several real-life incidents from Valli&#x27;s life, including his estrangement from daughter Francine, who died in 1980. The show has been widely acclaimed, financially successful, and was nominated for eight Tony Awards, winning four, notably Best Musical, Actor, and Supporting Actor. It has touring companies around the world, as well as a version at Paris Las Vegas, and was adapted into a 2014 film of the same name directed by Clint Eastwood, with Young again appearing as Valli; Valli was less enthusiastic about the film, believing that some parts were miscast and that Eastwood was a poor fit for the material.

In October 2007, Valli released &quot;Romancing the &#x27;60s&quot;, an album containing covers of his favorite songs from the 1960s, two of which—&quot;Sunny&quot; and &quot;Any Day Now&quot;—he had previously recorded. It was Valli&#x27;s first solo album in nearly 27 years since 1980&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Above Me&quot;. In 2012, Valli made his Broadway debut with a week-long concert engagement at the Broadway Theatre in New York starting October 19.

From March 2016 to January 2017, &quot;Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons&quot; were touring the US, scheduled to play small-to-mid-size venues such as the Silver Legacy Casino in Reno, Nevada, the Celebrity Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona and the County Fair in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. In October 2016, Valli released his first solo album in nine years, &quot;″Tis the Seasons&quot;, which features some of his favorite Christmas songs. As part of the &quot;BBC Proms in the Park&quot; Valli, together with the Four Seasons performed with the BBC Concert Orchestra in Hyde Park on September 10, 2016.

Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons continued touring in 2018 and 2019, with a new lineup after his lineup since 2003 spun off as its own act, The Modern Gentlemen. In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic canceled all touring plans. Touring resumed in the summer of 2021 with dates scheduled through October 2024; in October 2023, Valli indicated that it would be his farewell tour and that The Four Seasons would effectively end its 65-year run with his retirement. Valli did not rule out future performances after the tour ends but noted that the nature of touring, and a move from longer residencies to frequent one-night stops, was wearing on him, while the actual act of performing each night was not. The tour was eventually extended into 2025, with representatives for Valli responding to criticism of him touring at such an advanced age and fears of elder abuse by assuring that Valli was &quot;doing just fine and super happy to be still performing.&quot; In a statement to &quot;People&quot;, Valli conceded that he uses &quot;layering (of) vocals and instrumentals&quot; to maintain the group&#x27;s signature sound in old age, a tactic the group had long used on its records, and stated he would continue touring as long as fans continued to buy tickets and respond well to the show.

In June 2021, Valli released his 12th studio album, his first in five years, &quot;Touch of Jazz&quot;, which features a collection of jazz cover songs.

== Acting career ==
Valli has appeared as an actor in &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (as Mafia boss Frank Doss), &quot;Full House&quot;, the 1998 TV movie &quot;Witness to the Mob&quot; (as Frank LoCascio of the Gambino crime family), &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (as mobster Rusty Millio), and the 2014 film &quot;And So It Goes&quot;.

On the November 21, 2014, episode of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; entitled &quot;Ka Hana malu (Inside Job)&quot;, Valli played mysterious lawyer Leonard Cassano, who was engaged to Carol Burnett&#x27;s character, Aunt Deb.

In 2015, Valli was interviewed on the AMC television series &quot;The Making of the Mob: New York&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Valli has been married four times. In his early twenties he married his first wife, Mary, who already had a two-year-old daughter named Celia. They had two daughters together, Antonia and Francine, and divorced after 13 years in 1971. He married MaryAnn Hannagan in 1974, and the marriage lasted eight years. Frankie married Randy Clohessy in 1984; they had three sons (Emilio, Francesco Jr. and Brando) and divorced in 2004. In 1980, his stepdaughter, Celia, was killed when she fell off a fire escape. Six months later, Francine, his youngest daughter from his marriage to Mary, died reportedly from a drug overdose. Antonia later briefly married Four Seasons drummer/vocalist Gerry Polci, and their daughter Olivia Polci, who also adopted the stage surname Valli, is a professional stage actress. She portrayed her grandmother Mary in a &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; production in 2019. Frankie married Jackie Jacobs on June 26, 2023, in Las Vegas. Valli and Jacobs reside in Encino, California. Valli has a restraining order against his son, Francesco Jr., an actor, due to an opiate addiction and threats of violence against his father and brothers.

One issue in Valli&#x27;s third divorce went up on appeal to the Supreme Court of California: whether a life insurance policy purchased in 2003 was community property. On May 15, 2014, the Court unanimously affirmed the trial court&#x27;s ruling that the policy was community property (and not Randy&#x27;s separate property), in an opinion signed by Associate Justice Joyce Kennard.

<doc id="182461" wikidata="Q1136667" url="?curid=182461" title="Tippecanoe River">
<text>The Tippecanoe River ( ) is a gentle, river in the Central Corn Belt Plains ecoregion in northern Indiana. It flows from Crooked Lake in Noble County to the Wabash River near what is now Battle Ground, about northeast of Lafayette. The name &quot;Tippecanoe&quot; was derived from a Miami-Illinois word for buffalo fish, reconstructed as &quot;*/kiteepihkwana/&quot; or as kiteepihkwana siipiiwi.

The Tippecanoe River is fed by 88 natural lakes and has a drainage area of , spanning 14 counties. It supports more numerous imperiled species and overall species diversity than most streams of the upper Midwest. The Nature Conservancy has identified it as one of the top ten rivers in the United States to preserve due to its ecological diversity and the high proportion of endangered species found in it.

==Course==
The Tippecanoe River originates from multiple kettle lakes formed by ancient glaciers in what is now Noble County, Indiana. Numerous dams were built along its length, to create lakes and ponds for water power. The river flows west into Wilmot Pond, which is formed by a small dam on its western side. After Wilmot, it crosses into Kosciusko County and enters Backwaters Lake, the basin of Webster Lake. After going over the dam at Webster Lake, the river travels a few miles and enters Tippecanoe Lake. From there the river flows south and west through the southeast corner of Marshall County, then bends northwest through the northern part of Fulton County and through Pulaski County, from the northeast corner to the south central portion, traversing Tippecanoe River State Park along the way. It enters White County, where dams form Lake Freeman and Lake Shafer. The river exits Lake Freeman from the south and flows through the west part of Carroll County into Tippecanoe County, where it joins the Wabash River.

In addition to Tippecanoe County, five townships through which the river flows are named Tippecanoe:
*Tippecanoe Township, Carroll County, Indiana
*Tippecanoe Township, Kosciusko County, Indiana
*Tippecanoe Township, Marshall County, Indiana
*Tippecanoe Township, Pulaski County, Indiana
*Tippecanoe Township, Tippecanoe County, Indiana

==History==
The Battle of Tippecanoe, in which Governor William Henry Harrison defeated the Indian confederacy of Tecumseh, occurred near the south bank of the river. Modern Lafayette developed near this site.

==Aquatic Life==
The Upper Tippecanoe River continues to have habitat suitable for unionid (freshwater mussel) species. The rivershed has retained much of its natural condition, continuing to provide a high quality habitat for freshwater mussels. Surveys done since 1903 show that the waterway continues to support 
57 species of mussels. Modern changes in the surrounding land use and dredging the river channel affect the silt levels and stream flow, which threaten the mussel populations. Of the existing species, several are state listed as endangered, including the northern riffleshell (Epioblasma Torulosa rangiana), the wavyrayed lampmussel (Lampsilis fasciola), the kidneyshell (Ptychobranchus fasciolaris), and the purple lilliput (Toxolasma lividus). The clubshell (Pleurobema clava) is a federally endangered specie.

The river fishery is similar to the early 1900s, even with the changes in river use and the increase in urban and agricultural use. Surveys done in the early 21st century found representatives of 14 families and 54 species of fishes. Nearly 80% of collected fish are game fish species, including: Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), Yellow perch (Perca flavescens), Walleye (Stizostedion vitreum), Muskellunge (Esox masquinongy), Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), White and Black crappie (Pomoxis annularis and P. nigromaculatus), Longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis), Northern pike (Esox lucius), Rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris), White bass (Morone chrysops) and Warmouth (Lepomis gulosus). Bluegill were the dominant fish, being 50% of the river population.

==Dams==
In the 1920s, two dams were built along the Tippecanoe River to produce electricity.
*Oakdale Hydro Plant, built in 1925, created Lake Freeman. Lake Freeman reached north through Monticello. It provides 9.2 MW of power through NiSource. Lake Freeman is held at above sealevel.
*Norway Hydro Plant, built in 1925, created Lake Shafer. Lake Shafer reached north from Norway. It provides 7.2 MW of power through NiSource. Lake Shafer is held at above sealevel.

<text>Valentine&#x27;s Day, also called Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day or the Feast of Saint Valentine, is celebrated annually on February 14. It originated as a Christian feast day honoring a martyr named Valentine, and through later folk traditions it has also become a significant cultural, religious and commercial celebration of romance and love in many regions of the world.

There are a number of martyrdom stories associated with various Saint Valentines connected to February 14, including an account of the imprisonment of Saint Valentine of Rome for ministering to Christians persecuted under the Roman Empire in the third century. According to an early tradition, Saint Valentine restored sight to the blind daughter of his jailer. Numerous later additions to the legend have better related it to the theme of love: tradition maintains that Saint Valentine performed weddings for Christian soldiers who were forbidden to marry by the Roman emperor; an 18th-century embellishment to the legend claims he wrote the jailer&#x27;s daughter a letter signed &quot;Your Valentine&quot; as a farewell before his execution.

The 8th-century Gelasian Sacramentary recorded the celebration of the Feast of Saint Valentine on February 14. The day became associated with romantic love in the 14th and 15th centuries, when notions of courtly love flourished, apparently by association with the &quot;lovebirds&quot; of early spring. In 18th-century England, it grew into an occasion for couples to express their love for each other by presenting flowers, offering confectionery, and sending greeting cards (known as &quot;valentines&quot;). Valentine&#x27;s Day symbols that are used today include the heart-shaped outline, doves, and the figure of the winged Cupid. In the 19th century, handmade cards gave way to mass-produced greetings. In Italy, Saint Valentine&#x27;s keys are given to lovers &quot;as a romantic symbol and an invitation to unlock the giver&#x27;s heart&quot;, as well as to children to ward off epilepsy (called Saint Valentine&#x27;s Malady).

It is a day of commemoration in the Anglican Communion and the Lutheran Church. Many parts of the Eastern Orthodox Church celebrate Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day on July 6 in honor of Roman presbyter Saint Valentine, and on July 30 in honor of Hieromartyr Valentine, the Bishop of Interamna (modern Terni).

== Saint Valentine ==
===History===
Numerous early Christian martyrs were named Valentine. The Valentines honored on February 14 are Valentine of Rome (&quot;Valentinus presb. m. Romae&quot;) and Valentine of Terni (&quot;Valentinus ep. Interamnensis m. Romae&quot;). Valentine of Rome was a priest in Rome who was martyred in 269 and was buried on the Via Flaminia. The relics of Saint Valentine were kept in the Church and Catacombs of San Valentino in Rome, which &quot;remained an important pilgrim site throughout the Middle Ages until the relics of Saint Valentine were transferred to the church of Santa Prassede during the pontificate of Nicholas IV [1288–1292]&quot;. The flower-crowned skull of Saint Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome. Other relics are found at Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland.

Valentine of Terni became bishop of Interamna (now Terni, in central Italy) and is said to have been martyred during the persecution under Emperor Aurelian in 273. He is buried on the Via Flaminia, but in a different location from Valentine of Rome. His relics are at the Basilica of Saint Valentine in Terni (&quot;Basilica di San Valentino&quot;). Professor Jack B. Oruch of the University of Kansas notes that &quot;abstracts of the acts of the two saints were in nearly every church and monastery of Europe.&quot; A relic claimed to be Saint Valentine of Terni&#x27;s head was preserved in the abbey of New Minster, Winchester, and venerated.

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; speaks of a third saint named Valentine who was mentioned in early martyrologies under date of February 14. He was martyred in Africa with a number of companions, but nothing more is known about him.

February 14 is celebrated as Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day in various Christian denominations; it has, for example, the rank of &quot;commemoration&quot; in the calendar of saints in the Anglican Communion. The feast day of Saint Valentine is given in the calendar of saints of the Lutheran Church. In the 1969 revision of the Roman Catholic Calendar of Saints, the feast day of Saint Valentine on February 14 was relegated from the General Roman Calendar to particular (local or even national) calendars for the following reason: &quot;Though the memorial of Saint Valentine is ancient, it is left to particular calendars, since, apart from his name, nothing is known of Saint Valentine except that he was buried on the Via Flaminia on February 14.&quot; Therefore, as he remains within the Roman Martyrology, he may be recognised optionally during mass outside of Christmastide and Eastertide.

The feast day is still celebrated in Balzan (Malta), where relics of the saint are claimed to be found, and also throughout the world by Traditionalist Catholics who follow the older, pre-Second Vatican Council calendar (see General Roman Calendar of 1960).

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Valentine is recognized on July 6, on which Saint Valentine, the Roman presbyter, is honoured; in addition, the Eastern Orthodox Church observes the feast of Hieromartyr Valentine, Bishop of Interamna, on July 30.

=== Legends ===
J.C. Cooper, in &quot;The Dictionary of Christianity&quot;, writes that Saint Valentine was &quot;a priest of Rome who was imprisoned for succouring persecuted Christians.&quot; Contemporary records of Saint Valentine were most probably destroyed during this Diocletianic Persecution in the early 4th century. In the 5th or 6th century, a work called &quot;Passio Marii et Marthae&quot; published a story of martyrdom for Saint Valentine of Rome, perhaps by borrowing tortures that happened to other saints, as was usual in the literature of that period.

The same events are found in &quot;Bede&#x27;s Martyrology&quot;, which was compiled in the 8th century. It states that Saint Valentine was persecuted as a Christian and interrogated by Roman Emperor Claudius II in person. Claudius was impressed by Valentine and had a discussion with him, attempting to get him to convert to Roman paganism in order to save his life. Valentine refused and tried to convert Claudius to Christianity instead. Because of this, he was executed. Before his execution, he is reported to have performed a miracle by healing Julia, the blind daughter of his jailer Asterius. The jailer&#x27;s daughter and his forty-six member household, family members and servants, came to believe in Jesus and were baptized.

A later &quot;Passio&quot; repeated the legend, adding that Pope Julius I built a church over his sepulchre (it is a confusion with a 4th-century tribune called Valentino, who donated land to build a church at a time when Julius was a Pope). The legend was picked up as fact by later martyrologies, starting with Bede&#x27;s martyrology in the 8th century. It was repeated in the 13th century, in &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;.

There is an additional embellishment to &quot;The Golden Legend&quot;, which according to Henry Ansgar Kelly, was added in the 18th century and widely repeated. On the evening before Valentine was to be executed, he is supposed to have written the first &quot;valentine&quot; card himself, addressed to the daughter of his jailer Asterius, who was no longer blind, signing as &quot;Your Valentine.&quot; The expression &quot;From your Valentine&quot; was later adopted by modern Valentine letters. This legend has been published by both American Greetings and The History Channel.
John Foxe, a 16th-century English historian, and the Order of Carmelites state that Saint Valentine was buried in the Church of Saint Praxedes in Rome, located near the cemetery of Saint Hippolytus. This order says that according to legend, &quot;Julia herself planted a pink-blossomed almond tree near his grave. Today, the almond tree remains a symbol of abiding love and friendship.&quot;

Another embellishment suggests that Saint Valentine performed clandestine Christian weddings for soldiers who were forbidden to marry. The Roman Emperor Claudius II supposedly forbade this in order to grow his army, believing that married men did not make for good soldiers. However, George Monger writes that this marriage ban was never issued and that Claudius II told his soldiers to take two or three women for themselves after his victory over the Goths.

According to legend, in order &quot;to remind these men of their vows and God&#x27;s love, Saint Valentine is said to have cut hearts from parchment&quot;, giving them to these soldiers and persecuted Christians, a possible origin of the widespread use of hearts on Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day.

Saint Valentine supposedly wore a purple amethyst ring, customarily worn on the hands of Christian bishops with an image of Cupid engraved in it, a recognizable symbol associated with love that was legal under the Roman Empire; Roman soldiers would recognize the ring and ask him to perform marriage for them. Probably due to the association with Saint Valentine, amethyst has become the birthstone of February, which is thought to attract love.

==Folk traditions==
While the European folk traditions connected with Saint Valentine and Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day have become marginalized by modern customs connecting the day with romantic love, there are still some connections with the advent of spring.

While the custom of sending cards, flowers, chocolates and other gifts originated in the UK, Valentine&#x27;s Day still remains connected with various regional customs in England. In Norfolk, a character called &quot;Jack&quot; Valentine knocks on the rear door of houses, leaving sweets and presents for children. Although he was leaving treats, many children were scared of this mystical person.

In Slovenia, Saint Valentine or Zdravko was one of the saints of spring, the saint of good health and the patron of beekeepers and pilgrims.
A proverb says that &quot;Saint Valentine brings the keys of roots&quot;. Plants and flowers start to grow on this day. It has been celebrated as the day when the first work in the vineyards and in the fields commences. It is also said that birds propose to each other or marry on that day. Another proverb says (&#x27;Valentine – the first spring saint&#x27;), as in some places (especially White Carniola), Saint Valentine marks the beginning of spring. Valentine&#x27;s Day has only recently been celebrated as the day of love. The day of love was traditionally March 12, Saint Gregory&#x27;s day, or February 22, Saint Vincent&#x27;s Day. The patron of love was Saint Anthony, whose day has been celebrated on June 13.

== Connection with romantic love ==

=== Possible ancient origins ===

The &quot;Feast&quot; (, ) of Saint Valentine originated in Christendom and has been marked by the Western Church of Christendom in honour of one of the Christian martyrs named Valentine, as recorded in the 8th-century Gelasian Sacramentary. In Ancient Rome, Lupercalia was observed February 13–15 on behalf of Pan and Juno, pagan gods of love, marriage and fertility. It was a rite connected to purification and health, and had only slight connection to fertility (as a part of health) and none to love. The celebration of Saint Valentine is not known to have had any romantic connotations until Chaucer&#x27;s poetry about &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; in the 14th century, some seven hundred years after celebration of Lupercalia is believed to have ceased.

Lupercalia was a festival local to the city of Rome. The more general Festival of Juno Februa, meaning &quot;Juno the purifier&quot; or &quot;the chaste Juno&quot;, was celebrated on February 13–14. Although the Pope Gelasius I (492–496) article in the Catholic Encyclopedia says that he abolished Lupercalia, theologian and Methodist minister Bruce Forbes wrote that &quot;no evidence&quot; has been demonstrated to link Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day and the rites of the ancient Roman purification festival of Lupercalia, despite claims by many authors to the contrary.

Some researchers have theorized that Gelasius I replaced Lupercalia with the celebration of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary and claim a connection to the 14th century&#x27;s connotations of romantic love, but there is no historical indication that he ever intended such a thing. Also, the dates do not fit because at the time of Gelasius I, the feast was only celebrated in Jerusalem, and it was on February 14 only because Jerusalem placed the Nativity of Jesus (Christmas) on January 6. Although it was called &quot;Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot;, it also dealt with the presentation of Jesus at the temple. Jerusalem&#x27;s Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary on February 14 became the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple on February 2 as it was introduced to Rome and other places in the sixth century, after Gelasius I&#x27;s time.

While sometimes repeated uncritically by modern sources that men or boys drew names of women or girls from a jar to couple for the duration of Lupercalia, there is no ancient evidence for any kind of lottery or sortition scheme pairing couples for sex. The first descriptions of this fictitious lottery appeared in the 15th century in relation to Valentine&#x27;s Day, with a connection to the Lupercalia first asserted in 18th century antiquarian works, such as those by Alban Butler (&quot;The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Other Principal Saints&quot;, 1756–1759) and Francis Douce. These modern sources claimed that the fictional Lupercalia was the source of the practice of sending valentines. 

The practice of sending valentines originated in the Middle Ages, with no link to Lupercalia, with boys drawing the names of girls at random. This custom was combated by priests, for example by Frances de Sales around 1600, apparently by replacing it with a religious custom of girls drawing the names of apostles from the altar. However, this religious custom is recorded as early as the 13th century in the life of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, so it could have a different origin.

=== Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Parliament of Fowls&quot;===
The first recorded association of Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day with romantic love is believed to be in the &quot;Parliament of Fowls&quot; (1382) by Geoffrey Chaucer, a dream vision portraying a parliament for birds to choose their mates. Honouring the first anniversary of the engagement of fifteen-year-old King Richard II of England to fifteen-year-old Anne of Bohemia, Chaucer wrote (in Middle English):

In modern English:
&quot;For this was on Saint Valentine&#x27;s DayWhen every fowl comes there to choose his matchOf every kind that men may think ofAnd that so huge a noise they began to makeThat earth and air and tree and every lakeWas so full, that not easily was there spaceFor me to stand—so full was all the place.&quot;

Readers have uncritically assumed that Chaucer was referring to February 14 as Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day. Henry Ansgar Kelly has observed that Chaucer might have had in mind the feast day of St. Valentine of Genoa, an early bishop of Genoa who died around AD 307; it was probably celebrated on May 3. A treaty providing for Richard II and Anne&#x27;s marriage, the subject of the poem, was signed on May 2, 1381.

Jack B. Oruch notes that the date on which spring begins has changed since Chaucer&#x27;s time because of the precession of the equinoxes and the introduction of the more accurate Gregorian calendar only in 1582. On the Julian calendar in use in Chaucer&#x27;s time, February 14 would have fallen on the date now called February 23, a time when some birds have started mating and nesting in England.

Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Parliament of Fowls&quot; refers to a supposedly established tradition, but there is no record of such a tradition before Chaucer. The speculative derivation of sentimental customs from the distant past began with 18th-century antiquaries, notably Alban Butler, the author of &quot;Butler&#x27;s Lives of Saints&quot;, and have been perpetuated even by respectable modern scholars. Most notably, &quot;the idea that Valentine&#x27;s Day customs perpetuated those of the Roman Lupercalia has been accepted uncritically and repeated, in various forms, up to the present&quot;.

Three other authors who made poems about birds mating on St. Valentine&#x27;s Day around the same years: Otton de Grandson from Savoy, John Gower from England, and a knight called Pardo from Valencia. Chaucer most probably predated all of them; but due to the difficulty of dating medieval works, it is not possible to ascertain which of the four may have influenced the others.

=== Court of love ===
The earliest description of February 14 as an annual celebration of love appears in the &quot;Charter of the Court of Love&quot;. The charter, allegedly issued by Charles VI of France at Mantes-la-Jolie in 1400, describes lavish festivities to be attended by several members of the royal court, including a feast, amorous song and poetry competitions, jousting and dancing. Amid these festivities, the attending ladies would hear and rule on disputes from lovers. No other record of the court exists, and none of those named in the charter were present at Mantes except Charles&#x27;s queen, Isabeau of Bavaria, who may well have imagined it all while waiting out a plague.

===Valentine poetry===
The earliest surviving valentine is a 15th-century rondeau written by Charles, Duke of Orléans to his wife, which commences.
 At the time, the duke was being held in the Tower of London following his capture at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415.

The earliest surviving valentines in English appear to be those in the &quot;Paston Letters&quot;, written in 1477 by Margery Brewes to her future husband John Paston &quot;my right well-beloved Valentine&quot;.

Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day is mentioned ruefully by Ophelia in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1600–1601):

John Donne used the legend of the marriage of the birds as the starting point for his epithalamion celebrating the marriage of Elizabeth, daughter of James I of England, and Frederick V, Elector Palatine, on Valentine&#x27;s Day:

The verse &quot;Roses are red&quot; echoes conventions traceable as far back as Edmund Spenser&#x27;s epic &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1590):

&quot;She bath&#x27;d with roses red, and violets blew,
And all the sweetest , that in the forrest grew.&quot;

The modern cliché Valentine&#x27;s Day poem can be found in &quot;Gammer Gurton&#x27;s Garland&quot; (1784), a collection of English nursery rhymes published in London by Joseph Johnson:

&quot;The rose is red, the violet&#x27;s blue,
The honey&#x27;s sweet, and so are you.
Thou art my love and I am thine;
I drew thee to my Valentine:
The lot was cast and then I drew,
And Fortune said it shou&#x27;d be you.&quot;

=== Modern times ===

In 1797, a British publisher issued &quot;The Young Man&#x27;s Valentine Writer&quot;, which contained scores of suggested sentimental verses for the young lover unable to compose his own. Printers had already begun producing a limited number of cards with verses and sketches, called &quot;mechanical valentines&quot;. Paper Valentines became so popular in England in the early 19th century that they were assembled in factories. Fancy Valentines were made with real lace and ribbons, with paper lace introduced in the mid-19th century. In 1835, 60,000 Valentine cards were sent by post in the United Kingdom, despite postage being expensive.

A reduction in postal rates following Sir Rowland Hill&#x27;s postal reforms with the 1840 invention of the postage stamp (Penny Black) saw the number of Valentines posted increase, with 400,000 sent just one year after its introduction, and ushered in the less personal but easier practice of mailing Valentines. That made it possible for the first time to exchange cards anonymously, which is taken as the reason for the sudden appearance of racy verse in an era otherwise prudishly Victorian. Production increased, &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Manufactory&quot; as Charles Dickens termed it, with over 3,000 women employed in manufacturing. The Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection at Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 450 Valentine&#x27;s Day cards dating from early 19th century Britain, printed by the major publishers of the day. The collection appears in Seddon&#x27;s book &quot;Victorian Valentines&quot; (1996).
In the United States, the first mass-produced Valentines of embossed paper lace were produced and sold shortly after 1847 by Esther Howland (1828–1904) of Worcester, Massachusetts. Her father operated a large book and stationery store, but Howland took her inspiration from an English Valentine she had received from a business associate of her father. Intrigued with the idea of making similar Valentines, Howland began her business by importing paper lace and floral decorations from England.

A writer in &quot;Graham&#x27;s American Monthly&quot; observed in 1849, &quot;Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day ... is becoming, nay it has become, a national holyday.&quot; The English practice of sending Valentine&#x27;s cards was established enough to feature as a plot device in Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Harrison&#x27;s Confessions&quot; (1851): &quot;I burst in with my explanations: &#x27;The valentine I know nothing about.&#x27; &#x27;It is in your handwriting&#x27;, said he coldly.&quot; Since 2001, the Greeting Card Association has been giving an annual &quot;Esther Howland Award for a Greeting Card Visionary&quot;.

Since the 19th century, handmade cards have given way to mass-produced greeting cards. In the UK, just under half of the population spend money on their Valentines, and around £1.9 billion was spent in 2015 on cards, flowers, chocolates, and other gifts. The mid-19th century Valentine&#x27;s Day trade was a harbinger of further commercialized holidays in the U.S. to follow.
In 1868, the British chocolate company Cadbury created Fancy Boxes – a decorated box of chocolates – in the shape of a heart for Valentine&#x27;s Day. Boxes of filled chocolates quickly became associated with the holiday. In the second half of the 20th century, the practice of exchanging cards was extended to all manner of gifts, such as giving jewelry.

The U.S. Greeting Card Association estimates that approximately 190 million valentines are sent each year in the US. Half of those valentines are given to family members other than husband or wife, usually to children. When the valentine-exchange cards made in school activities are included the figure goes up to 1 billion, and teachers become the people receiving the most valentines.

The increase in use of the Internet around the turn of the millennium is creating new traditions. Every year, millions of people use digital means of creating and sending Valentine&#x27;s Day greeting messages such as e-cards, love coupons and printable greeting cards. Valentine&#x27;s Day is considered by some to be a Hallmark holiday due to its commercialization.

In 2016, the Catholic Bishops of England and Wales established a novena prayer &quot;to support single people seeking a spouse ahead of St Valentine&#x27;s Day.&quot;

==Celebration and status worldwide==
Valentine&#x27;s Day customs—sending greeting cards (known as &quot;valentines&quot;), offering confectionery and presenting flowers—developed in early modern England and spread throughout the English-speaking world in the 19th century. In the later 20th and early 21st centuries, these customs spread to other countries, like those of Halloween, and aspects of Christmas (such as Santa Claus).

Valentine&#x27;s Day is celebrated in many East Asian countries, with Singaporeans, Chinese, and South Koreans spending the most money on Valentine&#x27;s gifts.

===Americas===

====Latin America====
In most Latin American countries—for example, Costa Rica, Mexico, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico—Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day is known as (&#x27;Lovers&#x27; Day&#x27;) or as (&#x27;Love and Friendship Day&#x27;). It is also common to see people perform &quot;acts of appreciation&quot; for their friends.

In Guatemala it is known as (&#x27;Affection Day&#x27;). Some countries, in particular the Dominican Republic and El Salvador, have a tradition called (&#x27;secret friend&#x27;), which is a game similar to the Christmas tradition of Secret Santa.

====Brazil====

In Brazil, the (&#x27;Lovers&#x27; Day&#x27;, or &#x27;Boyfriends/Girlfriends Day&#x27;) is celebrated on June 12, probably because that is the day before Saint Anthony&#x27;s day—a saint recognized for blessing young couples with happy and prosperous marriages—when traditionally many single women perform popular rituals called in order to find a good husband or boyfriend. Couples exchange gifts, chocolates, cards, and flower bouquets. The February 14 Valentine&#x27;s Day is not celebrated at all because it is usually too close to Brazilian Carnival, which can fall anywhere from early February to early March and lasts almost a week.

====Colombia====
Colombia celebrates (&#x27;Love and Friendship Day&#x27;) on the third Saturday in September instead. is also popular there.

====United States====
On the United States mainland, about 190 million Valentine&#x27;s Day cards are sent each year, not including the hundreds of millions of cards school children exchange.

Valentine&#x27;s Day is a major source of economic activity, with total expenditure topping $18.2 billion in 2017, or over $136 per person. This was an increase from $108 per person in 2010. Purchases include jewellery, flowers, chocolates, candy, and greeting cards. Roses, especially red roses, are the most popular flower. In the US, roses are generally imported via refrigerated airplanes from Colombia and Ecuador. The most popular locally grown and seasonally compatible flowers are early spring tulips.

In 2019, a survey by the National Retail Federation found that over the previous decade, the percentage of people who celebrate Valentine&#x27;s Day had declined steadily. From their survey results, they found three primary reasons: over-commercialization of the holiday, not having a spouse or significant other to celebrate it with, and not being interested in celebrating it.

===Asia===

==== Afghanistan ====
In pre-Taliban years, Koch-e-Gul-Faroushi (&#x27;Flower Street&#x27;) in downtown Kabul used to be adorned with innovative flower arrangements, to attract the Valentine&#x27;s Day-celebrating youth. In the Afghan tradition, love is often expressed through poetry. A new generation of budding poets such as Ramin Mazhar and Mahtab Sahel express themselves through poetry, using Valentine&#x27;s Day as a theme to voice concerns about the erosion of freedoms. In their political commentary, they defy fear by saying &quot;I kiss you amid the Taliban&quot;.

==== Bangladesh ====

Valentine&#x27;s Day was first celebrated in Bangladesh by Shafik Rehman, a journalist and editor of the newspaper &quot;Jaijaidin&quot;, in 1993. He was acquainted with Western culture from studying in London. He highlighted Valentine&#x27;s Day to the Bangladeshi people through &quot;Jaijaidin&quot;. Rehman is called the &quot;father of Valentine&#x27;s Day in Bangladesh&quot;. On this day, people in various types of relationship, including lovers, friends, husbands and wives, mothers and children, students and teachers, express their love for each other with flowers, chocolates, cards and other gifts. On this day, various parks and recreation centers of the country are full of people of love. No public holiday, however, is declared on this day in Bangladesh.

Some in Bangladesh feel that celebrating this day is not acceptable from a cultural and Islamic point of view. Before the celebration of Valentine&#x27;s Day, February 14 was celebrated as the anti-authoritarian day in Bangladesh. However, that day has been disregarded by people to celebrate Valentine&#x27;s Day.

====China====

In Chinese, Valentine&#x27;s Day is called &quot;lovers&#x27; festival&quot; (; Mandarin: &quot;Qīng Rén Jié&quot;; Hokkien: &quot;Chêng Lîn Chiat&quot;; Cantonese: &quot;Chìhng Yàhn Jit&quot;; Shanghainese &quot;Xin Yin Jiq&quot;). The &quot;Chinese Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; is the Qixi Festival (meaning &quot;The Night of Sevens&quot;; ), celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar. According to the legend, the Cowherd star and the Weaver Maid star are normally separated by the Milky Way (silvery river) but are allowed to meet by crossing it on the seventh day of the seventh month of the Chinese calendar.

In recent years, celebrating White Day has also become fashionable among some young people.

====India====

In ancient India, there was a tradition of adoring Kamadeva, the lord of love – exemplified by the erotic carvings in the Khajuraho Group of Monuments and by the writing of the &quot;Kamasutra&quot;. This tradition was lost around the Middle Ages, when Kamadeva was no longer celebrated, and public displays of sexual affection became frowned upon. This repression of public affections began to loosen in the 1990s.

Valentine&#x27;s Day celebrations did not catch on in India until around 1992. It was spread due to the programs in commercial TV channels, such as MTV, dedicated radio programs, and love letter competitions, in addition to an economical liberalization that allowed the explosion of the valentine card industry. The celebration has caused a sharp change on how people have been displaying their affection in public since the Middle Ages.

On a 2018 online survey, it was found that 68% of the respondents did not wish to celebrate Valentine&#x27;s Day. It can be also observed that different religious groups, including Hindu, Muslim and Christian people of India do not support Valentine&#x27;s Day.

In modern times, Hindu and Islamic traditionalists have considered the holiday to be cultural contamination from the West, a result of globalization in India. Shiv Sena and the Sangh Parivar have asked their followers to shun the holiday and the &quot;public admission of love&quot; because of them being &quot;alien to Indian culture&quot;. Although these protests are organized by political elites, the protesters themselves are middle-class Hindu men who fear that the globalization will destroy the traditions in their society: arranged marriages, Hindu joint families, full-time mothers, etc. Despite these obstacles, Valentine&#x27;s Day is becoming increasingly popular in India.

Valentine&#x27;s Day has been strongly criticized from a postcolonial perspective by intellectuals from the Indian left. The holiday is regarded as a front for &quot;Western imperialism&quot;, &quot;neocolonialism&quot;, and &quot;the exploitation of working classes through commercialism by multinational corporations&quot;. It is claimed that as a result of Valentine&#x27;s Day, the working classes and rural poor become more disconnected socially, politically, and geographically from the hegemonic capitalist power structure. They also criticize mainstream media attacks on Indians opposed to Valentine&#x27;s Day as a form of demonization that is designed and derived to further the Valentine&#x27;s Day agenda.
Right wing Hindu nationalists are also hostile. In February 2012, Subash Chouhan of the Bajrang Dal warned couples: &quot;They cannot kiss or hug in public places. Our activists will beat them up&quot;.
He said &quot;We are not against love, but we criticize vulgar exhibition of love at public places&quot;.

According to &quot;The Hindu&quot; in February 2023, the Animal Welfare Board of India appealed to Indians to celebrate February 14 as &quot;Cow Hug Day&quot; for &quot;emotional richness&quot; and to increase &quot;individual and collective happiness.&quot; The newspaper referenced the sacredness of cows as being equivalent to one&#x27;s mother in Indian culture, and further rued: &quot;.. Vedic traditions are almost on the verge of extinction due to the progress of Western culture over time. The dazzle of Western civilization has made our physical culture and heritage almost forgotten&quot;. 

According to Rhea Mogul of CNN, a 2017 photo series Indian women sporting cow masks by activist Sujatro Ghosh portrays a society in which cows are more valued than women. Mogul says authorities had advanced the idea to rebrand Valentine&#x27;s Day as &quot;Cow Hug Day&quot;. Mogul says, &quot;But the move seems to have failed and later retracted after it prompted a rush of internet memes, cartoons and jokes by TV hosts about the importance of consent.&quot; Media outlets like NDTV mocked the government&#x27;s plan by underlining the importance of the consent of cows before hugging them. Mogul says critics say cow-worship has been politically manipulated by cow vigilante motivated by conservative BJP&#x27;s majoritarian politics to harass minorities with allegations of disrespect of cows or cow slaughter.

====Iran====
The history of Valentine&#x27;s Day in Iran dates back to the Qajar era of the latter half of the 19th century. Naser al-Din Shah Qajar did not take his wife with him during his trip to Europe and he sent her a greeting card from distance on Valentine&#x27;s Day. This greeting card is available in Iranian museums.

Since the mid-2000s, Valentine&#x27;s Day has become increasingly popular in Iran, especially among young people. However, it has also been the subject of heavy criticism from Iranian conservatives, who see it as part of the spread of &quot;decadent&quot; Western culture. Since 2011, authorities have attempted to discourage celebrations and impose restrictions on the sale and production of Valentine&#x27;s Day-related goods, although the holiday remains popular as of 2018. Additionally, there have been efforts to revive the ancient Persian festival of Sepandārmazgān, which takes place around the same time, to replace Valentine&#x27;s Day. However, as of 2016, this has also been largely unsuccessful.

====Israel====
In Israel, the Jewish tradition of Tu B&#x27;Av has been revived and transformed into the Jewish equivalent of Valentine&#x27;s Day. It is celebrated on the 15th day of the month of Av (usually in late August). In ancient times girls would wear white dresses and dance in the vineyards, where the boys would be waiting for them (Mishna Taanith, end of Chapter 4). Today, Tu B&#x27;Av is celebrated as a second holiday of love by secular people (along with Valentine&#x27;s Day), and it shares many of the customs associated with Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day in Western societies. In modern Israeli culture Tu B&#x27;Av is a popular day to proclaim love, propose marriage, and give gifts like cards or flowers.

====Japan====
In Japan, Morozoff Ltd. introduced the holiday for the first time in 1936, when it ran an advertisement aimed at foreigners. Later, in 1953, it began promoting the giving of heart-shaped chocolates; other Japanese confectionery companies followed suit thereafter. In 1958, the Isetan department store ran a &quot;Valentine sale&quot;. Further campaigns during the 1960s popularized the custom.
The custom that only women give chocolates to men may have originated from the translation error of a chocolate-company executive during the initial campaigns. In particular, office ladies give chocolate to their co-workers. Unlike western countries, gifts such as greeting cards, candies, flowers, or dinner dates are uncommon, and most of the gifts-related activity is about giving the right amount of chocolate to each person. Japanese chocolate companies make half their annual sales during this time of the year.

Many women feel obliged to give chocolates to all male co-workers, except when the day falls on a Sunday, a holiday. This is known as , from (&#x27;obligation&#x27;) and , (&#x27;chocolate&#x27;), with unpopular co-workers receiving only cheap chocolate. This contrasts with , chocolate given to a loved one. Friends, especially girls, may exchange chocolate referred to as .

In the 1980s, the Japanese National Confectionery Industry Association launched a successful campaign to make March 14 a &quot;reply day&quot;, on which men are expected to return the favour to those who gave them chocolates on Valentine&#x27;s Day, calling it White Day for the color of the chocolates being offered. A previous failed attempt to popularize this celebration had been done by a marshmallow manufacturer who wanted men to return marshmallows to women.

In Japan, the romantic &quot;date night&quot; associated with Valentine&#x27;s Day is celebrated on Christmas Eve.

==== Malaysia ====
Islamic officials in West Malaysia warned Muslims against celebrating Valentine&#x27;s Day, linking it with vice activities. Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said the celebration of romantic love was &quot;not suitable&quot; for Muslims. Wan Mohamad Sheikh Abdul Aziz, head of the Malaysian Islamic Development Department (Jakim), which oversees the country&#x27;s Islamic policies said that a fatwa (ruling) issued by the country&#x27;s top clerics in 2005 noted that the day &quot;is associated with elements of Christianity,&quot; and &quot;we just cannot get involved with other religions&#x27; worshipping rituals.&quot; Jakim officials planned to carry out a nationwide campaign called &quot;Awas Jerat Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (&quot;Mind the Valentine&#x27;s Day Trap&quot;), aimed at preventing Muslims from celebrating the day on February 14, 2011. Activities included conducting raids in hotels to stop young couples from having unlawful sex and distributing leaflets to Muslim university students warning them against the day.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2011, West Malaysian religious authorities arrested more than 100 Muslim couples concerning the celebration ban. Some of them would be charged in the Shariah Court for defying the department&#x27;s ban against the celebration of Valentine&#x27;s Day.

In East Malaysia, the celebrations are much more tolerated among young Muslim couples, although some Islamic officials and Muslim activists from the West side have told younger generations to refrain from such celebration by organising da&#x27;wah and tried to spread their ban into the East. In both the states of Sabah and Sarawak, the celebration is usually common with flowers.

==== Pakistan ====

The concept of Valentine&#x27;s Day was introduced into Pakistan during the late 1990s with special TV and radio programs. The Jamaat-e-Islami political party has called for the banning of Valentine&#x27;s Day celebration. Despite this, the celebration is becoming popular among urban youth and the florists expect to sell a great number of flowers, especially red roses. The case is the same with card publishers.

In 2016, the local governing body of Peshwar officially banned the celebration of Valentine&#x27;s Day in the city. The ban was also implemented in other cities such as Kohat by the local governments.

In 2017, the Islamabad High Court banned Valentine&#x27;s Day celebrations in public places in Pakistan. More than 80% of Dawn readers polled on its website agreed with this decision.

In 2018, because of a petition by a citizen, Abdul Waheed, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority advised broadcasters and newspapers against airing any Valentine&#x27;s Day celebrations.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, Valentine&#x27;s Day is called in much the same manner as in the West. It is usually marked by a steep increase in the price of flowers, particularly red roses. It is the most popular day for weddings, with some localities offering mass ceremonies for no charge.

====Saudi Arabia====
In Saudi Arabia, in 2002 and 2008, religious police banned the sale of all Valentine&#x27;s Day items, telling shop workers to remove any red items, because the day is considered a Christian holiday. This ban has created a black market for roses and wrapping paper. In 2012, the religious police arrested more than 140 Muslims for celebrating the holiday, and confiscated all red roses from flower shops. Muslims are not allowed to celebrate the holiday, and non-Muslims can celebrate only behind closed doors.

&quot;Saudi cleric Sheikh Muhammad Al-&#x27;Arifi said on Valentine&#x27;s Day Eve that celebrating this holiday constitutes bid&#x27;a – a forbidden innovation and deviation from religious law and custom – and mimicry of the West.&quot;

However, in 2017 and 2018, after a fatwa was widely circulated, the religious police did not prevent Muslims from celebrating the day. In 2018, Sheikh Ahmed Qasim Al-Ghamdi, a Saudi cleric and former president of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, said that Valentine&#x27;s Day is not haram and is compatible with Islamic values.

====Singapore====
According to findings, Singaporeans are among the biggest spenders on Valentine&#x27;s Day, with 60% of Singaporeans indicating that they would spend between $100 and $500 during the season leading up to the holiday.

====South Korea====
In South Korea, women give chocolate to men on February 14, and men give non-chocolate candy to women on March 14 (White Day). On April 14 (Black Day), those who did not receive anything on February or March 14 go to a Chinese-Korean restaurant to eat black noodles () and lament their &quot;single life&quot;. Koreans also celebrate Pepero Day on November 11, when young couples give each other pepero cookies. The date &quot;11/11&quot; is intended to resemble the long shape of the cookie. The 14th of every month marks a love-related day in Korea, although most of them are obscure. From January to December, the sequence of these days is Candle Day, Valentine&#x27;s Day, White Day, Black Day, Rose Day, Kiss Day, Silver Day, Green Day, Music Day, Wine Day, Movie Day, and Hug Day. Korean women give a much higher amount of chocolate than Japanese women.

====Taiwan====

In Taiwan, traditional Qixi Festival, Valentine&#x27;s Day and White Day are all celebrated. However, the situation is the reverse of Japan&#x27;s. Men give gifts to women on Valentine&#x27;s Day, and women return them on White Day.

===Europe===

====Estonia and Finland====
In Finland, Valentine&#x27;s Day is called (&#x27;Friend&#x27;s Day&#x27;). As the name indicates, this day is more about remembering friends, not significant others. In Estonia, Valentine&#x27;s Day was originally called and later also (&#x27;Friend&#x27;s Day&#x27;) as a calque of the Finnish term.

====France====
In France, a traditionally Catholic country, Valentine&#x27;s Day is known simply as &quot;Saint Valentin&quot;, and is celebrated in much the same way as other Western countries. The relics of Saint Valentin de Terni, the patron of the St Valentine&#x27;s Day, are in the Catholic church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste and Saint-Jean-l’Evangéliste, located in the southern France town of Roquemaure, Gard. The celebrations of takes place every two years on the Sunday closest to February 14. The village gets dressed in its 19th-century costume and put on the program with over 800 people.

====Greece====
Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day, or in Greek tradition, was not associated with romantic love. In the Eastern Orthodox church there is another saint who protects people who are in love, Hyacinth of Caesarea (feast day July 3); but this was not widely known until the late 1990s. In contemporary Greece, Valentine&#x27;s Day is generally celebrated as in the common western tradition.

====Ireland====

On Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day in Ireland, many individuals who seek true love make a Christian pilgrimage to the Shrine of St. Valentine in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, which is said to house relics of Saint Valentine of Rome; they pray at the shrine in hope of finding romance. There lies a book in which foreigners and locals have written their prayer requests for love.

==== Poland ====
Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day was introduced to Poland together with the cult of Saint Valentine via Bavaria and Tyrol. However, it rose in popularity in the 1990s. The only public celebration in Poland is held annually from 2002 in Chełmno under the name (Chełmno Valentine&#x27;s). Because Chełmno&#x27;s parish church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary has been holding the relic of Saint Valentine since the Middle Ages, local cult of the saint has been combined with the Anglo-Saxon tradition.

====Portugal====
In Portugal, the holiday is known as (Lovers&#x27; Day / Day of the Enamoured). As elsewhere, couples exchange gifts, but in some regions, women give a (&quot;lovers&#x27; handkerchief&quot;), which is usually embroidered with love motifs.

====Romania====
In recent years, Romania has also started celebrating Valentine&#x27;s Day. This has drawn backlash from several groups, institutions, and nationalist organizations like Noua Dreaptă, who condemn Valentine&#x27;s Day for being superficial, commercialist, and imported Western kitsch. In order to counter the perceived denaturation of national culture, Dragobete, a spring festival celebrated in parts of Southern Romania, has been rekindled after having been ignored during the Communist years as the traditional Romanian holiday for lovers. The holiday is named after a character from Romanian folklore who was supposed to be the son of Baba Dochia. Its date used to vary depending on the geographical area, however nowadays it is commonly observed on February 24.

====Scandinavia====
In Denmark and Norway, February 14 is known as , and is celebrated in much the same manner as in the United Kingdom. In Sweden it is called (&quot;All Hearts&#x27; Day&quot;) but is not widely celebrated. A 2016 survey revealed that fewer than 50% of men and women were planning to buy presents for their partners. The holiday has only been observed since the 1960s.

====Spain====
The holiday was first introduced in Spain through a 1948 advertisement campaign by the department store chain Galerías Preciados, and had become widespread by the 1970s.

Known as &quot;San Valentín&quot;, the holiday is celebrated the same way as in the rest of the West.

====United Kingdom====

In the UK, just under half of the population spends money on their valentines. Around £1.3 billion is spent yearly on cards, flowers, chocolates, and other gifts, with an estimated 25 million cards being sent.

In Wales, some people celebrate Dydd Santes Dwynwen (Saint Dwynwen&#x27;s Day) on January 25 instead of (or as well as) Valentine&#x27;s Day. The day commemorates St Dwynwen, the Welsh patron saint of love. The Welsh name for Saint Valentine is Sant Ffolant.

In a 2016 poll conducted by Channel 4 for Valentine&#x27;s Day, Jane Austen&#x27;s line, &quot;My heart is, and always will be, yours&quot;, from her novel &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; as said by Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) to Elinor Dashwood (Emma Thompson) in the acclaimed 1995 film adaptation, was voted the most romantic line from literature, film, and TV by thousands of women.

==Restrictions on Valentine&#x27;s Day in some countries==
Since 2009, certain practices pertaining to Valentine&#x27;s Day (such as giving flowers, cards, or other gifts suggestive of Valentine&#x27;s Day) are banned in Iran. Iran&#x27;s Law Enforcement Force prosecutes distributors of goods with symbols associated with Valentine&#x27;s Day. In 2021, the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Qom, Iran, stated that it would prosecute those who disseminate and provide anti-cultural symbols like those of Valentine&#x27;s Day. Although Valentine&#x27;s Day is not accepted or approved by any institution in Iran and has no official status, it is highly accepted among a large part of the population. One of the reasons for Valentine&#x27;s Day acceptance since the 2000s by the general population is the change in relations between the sexes, and because sexual relationships are no longer strictly limited to be within marriage.

<text>Pebbles Flintstone is a fictional character in the &quot;Flintstones&quot; franchise. The red-haired daughter of Fred and Wilma Flintstone, Pebbles was born near the end of the third season. She is most famous in her infant form on &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, but has also appeared at various other ages, including as a teenager on the early 1970s spin-off &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; and as an adult in three television films. She spent most of her time with Bamm-Bamm Rubble, her childhood best friend whom she eventually marries.

==Fictional character biography==
According to the February 22, 1963, edition of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, Pebbles was born at the Bedrock Rockapedic Hospital on February 22, 10,000 BC. That particular year was never actually cited within the show itself; most versions of the show put the Flintstones&#x27; era as around 1,000,000 BC.

As an infant, Pebbles quickly became lifelong best friends with her next-door neighbor, Bamm-Bamm Rubble.

As a pre-teen, Pebbles was an excellent baseball player, which led to a misadventure involving her father, as seen in the 1978 primetime special &quot;The Flintstones: Little Big League&quot;.

By the time she was a teenager, Pebbles began dating Bamm-Bamm and was noted for getting their friends into various misadventures, mostly due to sharing her dad&#x27;s penchant for schemes that would inevitably backfire (such as causing a strike by Bedrock&#x27;s city employees when she was elected honorary mayor for a week). Her friends and she attended Bedrock High School; Pebbles had a catchphrase similar to her father&#x27;s: &quot;Yabba-Dabba-Doozie!&quot;

As an adult, Pebbles pursued a career in advertising and married Bamm-Bamm. After this, the newly married couple moved to Hollyrock, a fictional, prehistoric version of Hollywood, California. They eventually had a son named Chip and a daughter named Roxy, who were fraternal twins.

==Chronology==

==Character marketing==
In 1963, when Hanna-Barbera decided to add a baby to the show, their first choice was a boy named Fred Junior. When Ideal Toy Company heard this, company executives approached Hanna-Barbera with a proposal to change the baby character to a girl for which the toymaker could create a doll, and Hanna-Barbera agreed.

Pebbles, in her conventional toddler incarnation, is sometimes seen in the various Post Fruity Pebbles and Cocoa Pebbles cereal commercials that have been produced over the years. 
Pebbles also appears on the packages of &quot;Flintstones&quot; children&#x27;s vitamins and with Bamm-Bamm on the packages of &quot;Flintstones&quot; toddler vitamins, which are manufactured by Bayer Healthcare (formerly Miles Laboratories).

<text>The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that originally aired for one season on CBS Saturday morning from September 11, 1971, to January 1, 1972. With an ensemble voice cast of Sally Struthers, Jay North, Mitzi McCall, Gay Hartwig, Carl Esser and Lennie Weinrib, the show follows teenage Pebbles Flintstone and Bamm-Bamm Rubble as they encounter problems growing up in the fictional town of Bedrock. &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; is the first spin-off series of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. For the 1972–73 season, the show was revamped as &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Hour&quot;, with more time given to the original &quot;Flintstones&quot; cast alongside both reruns and newly produced segments of &quot;Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm&quot;.

Similar to Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, it used contemporary rock music to attract more viewers. The 16 episodes have since had reruns broadcast on Boomerang often surrounded by interstitial cartoons and shorts. Critical responses were mixed. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Home Video&#x27;s &quot;Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection&quot; on a two disc set.

==Overview==
Set in the Stone Age, the series follows Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm as they face problems with growing up in the town of Bedrock. No longer toddlers, the two are now teenagers and began dating each other. The show focuses on them attending Bedrock High School and also getting their first jobs. Together, Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm form a musical band called the Bedrock Rockers, which was considered an attempt to be the &quot;Stone Age&quot; version of the Archies by one critic. Unlike &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, it centers on the children of the family, rather than parents Fred and Wilma Flintstone, and Barney and Betty Rubble. These characters continue to appear in the series, albeit in reduced roles.

==Cast and characters==
The series features the following seven main characters throughout its run:
* Sally Struthers as Pebbles Flintstone, Fred and Wilma&#x27;s daughter, Bamm-Bamm&#x27;s best friend/girlfriend, Barney and Betty&#x27;s honorary niece and a beautiful, social teenager. Enthusiastic, well-meaning and kind-hearted, she often tries to help someone in trouble, but usually ends up getting herself and her friends into even bigger trouble. Like her father, her catchphrase was &quot;Yabba-dabba-doozy!&quot;, which was appropriate as most of her schemes were indeed doozies. Much like &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, Pebbles&#x27;s &quot;trademark&quot; ponytail was held in place with a bone in the show. When Struthers left the series in order to fulfill a role on the American sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot;, actress Mickey Stevens took her place for &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; segments on &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Hour&quot;.
* Jay North as Bamm-Bamm Rubble, Barney and Betty&#x27;s muscular, adopted son, Fred and Wilma&#x27;s adopted nephew and Pebbles&#x27; best friend/boyfriend. This marked North&#x27;s second role as a voice actor for Hanna-Barbera (outside of &quot;Arabian Knights&quot;; he also voice acted in DePatie-Freleng&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes the Grump&quot;), having previously acted on series like &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; and &quot;My Three Sons&quot;.
* Mitzi McCall as Penny, the small intelligent friend of Pebbles who often worried about her weight.
* Gay Hartwig as:
** Wiggy, an astrology enthusiast who spoke in an operatic voice.
** Cindy, a spoiled primary antagonist who had a crush on Bamm-Bamm and nemesis of Pebbles.
** Betty Rubble, Wilma&#x27;s best friend/neighbor, Bamm-Bamm&#x27;s adopted mother, Barney&#x27;s wife and Pebbles&#x27; aunt.
* Carl Esser as Fabian, the other spoiled antagonist of the series and a nemesis of Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm.
* Lennie Weinrib as Moonrock, one of Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm&#x27;s friends who was intelligent and enjoyed inventing things, though they don&#x27;t always work as intended. Weinrib was a frequent voice actor for Hanna-Barbera, previously fulfilling roles on &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, and &quot;Help!... It&#x27;s the Hair Bear Bunch!&quot;.

==Production and continuation==
&quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; was the first spin-off TV series derived from &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, following the theatrical film &quot;The Man Called Flintstone&quot; in 1966. Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, creators of &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where are You!&quot;, served as story editors on &quot;Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm&quot;, and several individuals wrote episodes for the series, including Joel Kane, Woody Kling, and Howard Morganstern. Executive produced by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, Charles A. Nichols served as the director and Iwao Takamoto was the creative producer and key character designer. The main title theme and musical directors for &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; were made by Hoyt Curtin and Ted Nichols. Elliot Lawrence wrote songs for the series, with music arrangements by Lanny Meyers. The songs were recorded by Regent Sound Studios.

Author Christopher P. Lehman wrote that the success of &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; inspired Hanna-Barbera to create &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Hour&quot; in 1972. It combined previously broadcast episodes alongside new cartoons and shorts. Serving as a continuation, the new series featured newly-produced vignette versions of &quot;The Pebbles &amp; Bamm-Bamm Show,&quot; as well as reruns from the 1971-72 season, during each of its sixteen episodes. &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Hour&quot; also included musical interludes performed by The Bedrock Rockers, similar to the original series. &quot;Fred Flintstone and Friends&quot; (1977), a later anthology series compiled for syndication, included reruns of segments from both &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; and &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Hour&quot;.

&quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; was one of the first shows to use Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s limited laugh track, as they stopped using a full laugh track provided by Charley Douglass by the fall of 1971.

==Episodes==
==Reception==
===Broadcast history===
&quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; was broadcast on CBS as part of their Saturday morning children&#x27;s lineup between September 11, 1971, and January 1, 1972. Reruns of the series would later air again during 1975 and 1976.

The reruns of &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; were incorporated into the 1972 hour-long show &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Hour&quot; as the second half-hour of the show. When the &quot;Comedy Hour&quot; first started airing, four new &quot;Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm&quot; cartoons were produced for this position, but episodes were now shortened to two 11-minute segments in one 30-minute episode. After a few weeks, the new episodes stopped and the reruns of the original series began. Those new episodes were included in &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; DVD as bonus episodes. The noticeable difference is Mickey Stevens as Pebbles&#x27;s voice in the new episodes, concurrent with Stevens&#x27;s voice appearing as Pebbles anytime Pebbles is seen in the shorter cartoons that comprised the first half of &quot;The Flintstone Comedy Hour&quot;.

Boomerang has broadcast &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; on several occasions since its initial launch in 2000. Reruns on the network would occasionally air alongside interstitial cartoons, such as Barney Bear&#x27;s &quot;The Unwelcome Guest&quot; or Tex Avery&#x27;s &quot;Hound Hunters&quot; for example. As part of the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment and Warner Bros. Television Distribution&#x27;s &quot;Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection&quot;, the complete series was made available on DVD as a two-disc set.

===Critical reception===
Author Derek Tait wrote in his book &quot;1970s Childhood: From Bell-Bottoms to Disco Dancing&quot; that the cartoon was one of the popular Hanna-Barbera productions of the 1970s. In a retrospective view of older cartoons, the staff at MeTV included the show on their list of &quot;15 Forgotten Cartoons from the Early 1970s You Used to Love&quot;. Regarding the musical aspects, Tom and Sara Pendergast felt that both &quot;The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show&quot; and &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; incorporated contemporary rock music to attract a larger audience. On &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;″s list of &quot;the five dumbest moments&quot; of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, writer Chris Gaylord listed the series at number two. He called it &quot;the most curious&quot; of the various spin-offs and wrote, &quot;Mercifully, these misadventures at Bedrock High School only lasted one season&quot;.

<doc id="182476" wikidata="Q242627" url="?curid=182476" title="Pyrrole">
<text>Pyrrole is a heterocyclic, aromatic, organic compound, a five-membered ring with the formula . It is a colorless volatile liquid that darkens readily upon exposure to air. Substituted derivatives are also called pyrroles, e.g., &quot;N&quot;-methylpyrrole, . Porphobilinogen, a trisubstituted pyrrole, is the biosynthetic precursor to many natural products such as heme.

Pyrroles are components of more complex macrocycles, including the porphyrinogens and products derived therefrom, including porphyrins of heme, the chlorins, bacteriochlorins, and chlorophylls.

==Properties, structure, bonding==
Pyrrole is a colorless volatile liquid that darkens readily upon exposure to air, and is usually purified by distillation immediately before use. Pyrrole has a nutty odor. Pyrrole is a 5-membered aromatic heterocycle, like furan and thiophene. Unlike furan and thiophene, it has a dipole in which the positive end lies on the side of the heteroatom, with a dipole moment of 1.58 D. In CDCl3, it has chemical shifts at 6.68 (H2, H5) and 6.22 (H3, H4). Pyrrole is an extremely weak base for an amine, with a conjugate acid p&quot;K&quot;a of −3.8. The most thermodynamically stable pyrrolium cation (C4H6N+) is formed by protonation at the 2 position. Substitution of pyrrole with alkyl substituents provides a more basic molecule—for example, tetramethylpyrrole has a conjugate acid p&quot;K&quot;a of +3.7. Pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the N–H position, with a p&quot;K&quot;a of 16.5.
As a hydrogen bonding Lewis acid it is classified as a hard acid and the ECW model lists its acid parameters as &quot;E&quot;A = 1.38 and &quot;C&quot;A = 0.68.

Pyrrole has aromatic character because the lone pairs of electrons on the nitrogen atom is partially delocalized into the ring, creating a 4&quot;n&quot; + 2 aromatic system (see Hückel&#x27;s rule). In terms of its aromaticity, pyrrole&#x27;s is modest relative to benzene but comparable to related heterocycles thiophene and furan. The resonance energies of benzene, pyrrole, thiophene, and furan are, respectively, 152, 88, 121, and 67 kJ/mol (36, 21, 29, and 16 kcal/mol). The molecule is flat.

==History==
Pyrrole was first detected by F. F. Runge in 1834, as a constituent of coal tar. In 1857, it was isolated from the pyrolysate of bone. Its name comes from the Greek &quot;pyrrhos&quot; (, &quot;reddish, fiery&quot;), from the reaction used to detect it—the red color that it imparts to wood when moistened with hydrochloric acid.

==Occurrence in nature==

Pyrrole itself is not naturally occurring, but many of its derivatives are found in a variety of cofactors and natural products. Common naturally produced molecules containing pyrroles include vitamin B12, bile pigments like bilirubin and biliverdin, and the porphyrins of heme, chlorophyll, chlorins, bacteriochlorins, and porphyrinogens. Other pyrrole-containing secondary metabolites include PQQ, makaluvamine M, ryanodine, rhazinilam, lamellarin, prodigiosin, myrmicarin, and sceptrin. The syntheses of pyrrole-containing haemin, synthesized by Hans Fischer was recognized by the Nobel Prize.

Pyrrole is a constituent of tobacco smoke and may contribute to its toxic effects.

==Synthesis==
Pyrrole is prepared industrially by treatment of furan with ammonia in the presence of solid acid catalysts, like SiO2 and Al2O3.

Pyrrole can also be formed by catalytic dehydrogenation of pyrrolidine.

Several syntheses of the pyrrole ring have been described. Three routes dominate, but many other methods exist.

===Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis===

The Hantzsch pyrrole synthesis is the reaction of β-ketoesters (1) with ammonia (or primary amines) and α-haloketones (2) to give substituted pyrroles (3).

===Knorr pyrrole synthesis===

The Knorr pyrrole synthesis involves the reaction of an α-amino ketone or an α-amino-β-ketoester with an activated methylene compound. The method involves the reaction of an α-aminoketone (1) and a compound containing a methylene group α to (bonded to the next carbon to) a carbonyl group (2).

===Paal–Knorr pyrrole synthesis===

In the Paal–Knorr pyrrole synthesis, a 1,4-dicarbonyl compound reacts with ammonia or a primary amine to form a substituted pyrrole.

====Other methods====
Van Leusen reaction pyrroles are produced by reaction of tosylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC) with an enone in the presence of base, in a Michael addition. A 5-&quot;endo&quot; cyclization then forms the 5-membered ring, which reacts to eliminate the tosyl group. The last step is tautomerization to the pyrrole.

By the Barton–Zard synthesis, an isocyanoacetate reacts with a nitroalkene in a 1,4-addition, followed by 5-&quot;endo&quot;-&quot;dig&quot; cyclization, elimination of the nitro group, and tautomerization.

The starting materials in the Piloty–Robinson pyrrole synthesis, named for Gertrude and Robert Robinson and Oskar Piloty, are two equivalents of an aldehyde and hydrazine. The product is a pyrrole with substituents at the 3 and 4 positions. The aldehyde reacts with the diamine to an intermediate di-imine (R−C=N−N=C−R). In the second step, a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement takes place between. Addition of hydrochloric acid leads to ring closure and loss of ammonia to form the pyrrole. The mechanism was developed by the Robinsons.

In one modification, propionaldehyde is treated first with hydrazine and then with benzoyl chloride at high temperatures and assisted by microwave irradiation:

Pyrroles bearing multiple substituents have been obtained from the reaction of münchnones and alkynes. The reaction mechanism involves 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition followed by loss of carbon dioxide by a retro-Diels–Alder process. Similar reactions can be performed using azalactones.


Pyrroles can also be prepared by silver-catalyzed cyclization of alkynes with isonitriles, where R2 is an electron-withdrawing group, and R1 is an alkane, aryl group, or ester. Examples of disubstituted alkynes have also been seen to form the desired pyrrole in considerable yield. The reaction is proposed to proceed via a silver acetylide intermediate. This method is analogous to the azide–alkyne click chemistry used to form azoles.


One synthetic route to pyrrole involves the decarboxylation of ammonium mucate, the ammonium salt of mucic acid. The salt is typically heated in a distillation setup with glycerol as a solvent.

==Biosynthesis==
The biosynthesis of pyrrole rings begins with aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which is synthesized from glycine and succinyl-CoA. ALA dehydratase catalyzes the condensation of two ALA molecules via a Knorr-type ring synthesis to form porphobilinogen (PBG). This later reacts to form, for example, the macrocycles heme and chlorophyll. 
.

Proline is biosynthetically derived from the amino acid -glutamate. Glutamate-5-semialdehyde is first formed by glutamate 5-kinase (ATP-dependent) and glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (which requires NADH or NADPH). This can then either spontaneously cyclize to form 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid, which is reduced to proline by pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (using NADH or NADPH), or turned into ornithine by ornithine aminotransferase, followed by cyclisation by ornithine cyclodeaminase to form proline.

Proline can be used as precursor of aromatic pyrroles in secondary natural products, as in prodigiosins. 

The biosynthesis of Prodigiosin involves the convergent coupling of three pyrrole type rings (labeled A, B, and C in figure 1) from -proline, -serine, -methionine, pyruvate, and 2-octenal.

Ring A is synthesized from -proline through the nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) pathway (figure 2), wherein the pyrrolidine ring of proline is oxidized twice through FAD+ to yield pyrrole ring A.

Ring A is then expanded via the polyketide synthase pathway to incorporate -serine into ring B (figure 3). Ring A fragment is transferred from the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) to the Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP) by a KS domain, followed by transfer to malonyl-ACP via decarboxylative Claisen condensation. This fragment is then able to react with the masked carbanion formed from the PLP mediated decarboxylation of -serine, which cyclizes in a dehydration reaction to yield the second pyrrole ring. This intermediate is then modified by methylation (which incorporates a methyl group from -methionine onto the alcohol at the 6 position) and oxidation of the primary alcohol to the aldehyde to yield the core A–B ring structures.

==Reactions and reactivity==
Due to its aromatic character, pyrrole is difficult to hydrogenate, does not easily react as a diene in Diels–Alder reactions, and does not undergo usual olefin reactions. Its reactivity is similar to that of benzene and aniline, in that it is easy to alkylate and acylate. Under acidic conditions, pyrroles oxidize easily to polypyrrole, and thus many electrophilic reagents that are used in benzene chemistry are not applicable to pyrroles. In contrast, substituted pyrroles (including protected pyrroles) have been used in a broad range of transformations.

===Reaction of pyrrole with electrophiles===
Pyrroles generally react with electrophiles at the α position (C2 or C5), due to the highest degree of stability of the protonated intermediate. 
 Pyrroles react easily with nitrating (e.g. HNO3/Ac2O), sulfonating (Py·SO3), and halogenating (e.g. NCS, NBS, Br2, SO2Cl2, and KI/H2O2) agents. Halogenation generally provides polyhalogenated pyrroles, but monohalogenation can be performed. As is typical for electrophilic additions to pyrroles, halogenation generally occurs at the 2-position, but can also occur at the 3-position by silation of the nitrogen. This is a useful method for further functionalization of the generally less reactive 3-position.

====Acylation====
Acylation generally occurs at the 2-position, through the use of various methods. Acylation with acid anhydrides and acid chlorides can occur with or without a catalyst. 2-Acylpyrroles are also obtained from reaction with nitriles, by the Houben–Hoesch reaction. Pyrrole aldehydes can be formed by a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. 
===Reaction of deprotonated pyrrole===
The NH proton in pyrroles is moderately acidic with a p&quot;K&quot;a of 17.5. Pyrrole can be deprotonated with strong bases such as butyllithium and sodium hydride. The resulting alkali pyrrolide is nucleophilic. Treating this conjugate base with an electrophile such as iodomethane gives &quot;N&quot;-methylpyrrole. 

&quot;N&quot;-Metalated pyrrole can react with electrophiles at the N or C positions, depending on the coordinating metal. More ionic nitrogen–metal bonds (such as with lithium, sodium, and potassium) and more solvating solvents lead to &quot;N&quot;-alkylation. Nitrophilic metals, such as MgX, lead to alkylation at C (mainly C2), due to a higher degree of coordination to the nitrogen atom. In the cases of &quot;N&quot;-substituted pyrroles, metalation of the carbons is more facile. Alkyl groups can be introduced as electrophiles, or by cross-coupling reactions. 
Substitution at C3 can be achieved through the use of &quot;N&quot;-substituted 3-bromopyrrole, which can be synthesized by bromination of &quot;N&quot;-silylpyrrole with NBS.

===Reductions===
Pyrroles can undergo reductions to pyrrolidines and to pyrrolines. For example, Birch reduction of pyrrole esters and amides produced pyrrolines, with the regioselectivity depending on the position of the electron-withdrawing group.

===Cyclization reactions===
Pyrroles with &quot;N&quot;-substitution can undergo cycloaddition reactions such as [4+2]-, [2+2]-, and [2+1]-cyclizations. Diels-Alder cyclizations can occur with the pyrrole acting as a diene, especially in the presence of an electron-withdrawing group on the nitrogen. Vinylpyrroles can also act as dienes. 
Pyrroles can react with carbenes, such as dichlorocarbene, in a [2+1]-cycloaddition. With dichlorocarbene, a dichlorocyclopropane intermediate is formed, which breaks down to form 3-chloropyridine (the Ciamician–Dennstedt rearrangement). 
==Commercial uses==
Polypyrrole is of some commercial value. &quot;N&quot;-Methylpyrrole is a precursor to &quot;N&quot;-methylpyrrolecarboxylic acid, a building-block in pharmaceutical chemistry. Pyrroles are also found in several drugs, including atorvastatin, ketorolac, and sunitinib. Pyrroles are used as lightfast red, scarlet, and carmine pigments.
