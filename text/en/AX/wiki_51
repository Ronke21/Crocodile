<text>The Los Angeles River (), historically known as &#x27; by the Tongva and the &#x27; by the Spanish, is a major river in Los Angeles County, California. Its headwaters are in the Simi Hills and Santa Susana Mountains, and it flows nearly from Canoga Park through the San Fernando Valley, downtown Los Angeles, and the Gateway Cities to its mouth in Long Beach, where it flows into San Pedro Bay. While the river was once free-flowing and frequently flooding, forming alluvial flood plains along its banks, it currently flows through a concrete channel on a fixed course, which was built after a series of devastating floods in the early 20th century.

Before the opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, the river was the primary source of fresh water for the city. Although the Los Angeles region still receives some water from the river and other local sources, most of the water supply flows from several aqueducts serving the area. The Los Angeles River is heavily polluted from agricultural and urban runoff.

Fed primarily by rainwater and snowmelt (in winter and spring), the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys (in summer and fall), and urban discharge, it is one of the few low-elevation perennial rivers in Southern California. Some water usually reaches the ocean, even in the driest summers; although there are historical accounts of the river running dry, there has been constant flow of the river every month since recording of stream flow began in 1929. This is helped by the concrete channel, which limits absorption of water into the earth. Flow, while generally low in volume, can be extremely brisk even in summer.

==Course==

The Los Angeles River&#x27;s official beginning is at the confluence of two channelized streams – Bell Creek and Arroyo Calabasas – in the Canoga Park section of the city of Los Angeles, just east of California State Route 27 (Topanga Canyon Boulevard), at (the east side of Canoga Park High School). Bell Creek flows east from the Simi Hills, and Arroyo Calabasas flows north from the Santa Monica Mountains. From there the river flows east through a concrete flood control channel and very soon receives Browns Canyon Wash, which flows south from the Santa Susana Mountains. The river then bends slightly south and receives Aliso Canyon Wash, whose watershed adjoins that of Browns Canyon. The river then flows through the district of Winnetka, then Reseda and enters the Sepulveda Basin, a flood-control reservoir formed by the Sepulveda Dam.

As the river proceeds into the usually-dry reservoir, it spills out into a channel that is similar to its historical, non-channeled form. It crosses under Balboa Boulevard and then receives Bull Creek. The river then passes through the outlet works of Sepulveda Dam, from the mouth. It flows again into a concrete channel and crosses under the San Diego (405) Freeway as it passes through Van Nuys, Sherman Oaks, and Studio City, still flowing east. Paralleling U.S. Highway 101 briefly, it then veers southeast, away from the highway, and receives from the left the Tujunga Wash, one of its largest tributaries, which flows southwest and south from the Angeles National Forest in the San Gabriel Mountains. The river then rounds a bend to the northeast, now in a concrete box culvert, and crosses under the Hollywood (170) Freeway and Highway 101, and receives Burbank Western Channel on the left bank, from the mouth.

The river then begins to parallel the Ventura (134) Freeway as it winds through North Hollywood and the city of Burbank. It then crosses under the Golden State (5) Freeway and makes a sharp bend to the south-southeast as it curves around Griffith Park. It receives from the left Verdugo Wash, which drains much of La Cañada Flintridge and Glendale as it flows from the San Gabriel Mountains south through a water gap in the Verdugo Mountains, and crosses under the Ventura Freeway. Here, the river begins to flow over a natural riverbed, but enters another concrete section soon after. Paralleling the Golden State Freeway for the next few miles, the river runs by the eastern side of Griffith Park and the Harding-Wilson Golf Course. It passes Silver Lake Reservoir, which is to the right, and crosses under the Glendale (2) Freeway, from the mouth.

Making two meanders as it flows in a southeasterly direction, the river parallels the interstate and Riverside Drive then crosses under the interstate and Arroyo Seco (110) Parkway as it flows east of Elysian Park. It then receives the Arroyo Seco, another major tributary, from the left. The river flows south past the Mission Junction, a large railroad yard on the left. It enters a wider concrete channel with sloped sides, and crosses under Cesar Chavez Avenue, the Hollywood (101) Freeway, and the San Bernardino (10) Freeway as it passes east of downtown Los Angeles, flowing past the East Los Angeles Interchange of the Santa Ana (101) Freeway, Pomona (60) Freeway, and Interstates 5 and 10 on the left. It then makes a gradual turn east and then turns southeast, flowing a few miles before it begins to parallel the Long Beach (710) Freeway near Maywood, Bell, Cudahy, and Commerce, from the mouth.

Paralleling the Long Beach Freeway south-southwest, the river then crosses under former California State Route 42 and the interstate as it receives the Rio Hondo from the left, from the mouth. The Rio Hondo (&quot;deep river&quot;) now serves as a distributary for the San Gabriel River to the east via the Whittier Narrows Reservoir. The river then crosses under the Century (105) Freeway and shifts slightly southwest, then flows east of Compton and west of Bellflower. After crossing under the Artesia (91) Freeway, it receives Compton Creek from the right, from the mouth. After crossing under Interstate 405 for the second time, from the mouth, it draws close to the Dominguez Channel to the west and flows due south to its outlet in Long Beach, under Interstate 710, past the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, and into the Port of Long Beach.

==History==

Until the opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, the Los Angeles River was the main water source for the Los Angeles Basin. The river ran dry during the summers and flooded during winter months. Indigenous communities adapted to the climate surrounding the river, maximizing agricultural yields by rerouting the natural flow of the river and constructing water wheels along the river.

The river provided water and food to the Tongva people, hunters and gatherers who lived primarily off fish, small mammals, and the acorns from the abundant oak trees along the river&#x27;s path. There were at least 45 Tongva villages near the Los Angeles River, concentrated in the San Fernando Valley and the Elysian Valley, in what is present-day Glendale. After the Spanish established Mission San Gabriel in 1771, they referred to the Tongva living in that mission&#x27;s vicinity as Gabrieleño.

=== Alta California ===

In 1769, members of the Portolá expedition to explore Alta California were the first Europeans to see the river. On August 15, the party camped near the river, somewhere along the stretch just to the north of what is now the Interstate 10 crossing near downtown Los Angeles. Fray Juan Crespi, one of two Franciscan missionaries traveling with Portolá, named it &quot;el río de Nuestra Señora La Reina de Los Ángeles de Porciúncula&quot;. Crespi chose that name, because August 15 is the date of the yearly Catholic feast day in honor of the Virgin Mary&#x27;s Assumption into Heaven and assuming the role as Queen of the Angels, to which the small Portiuncula chapel, where the Franciscan Order began in Assisi, Italy, is dedicated. The river was thereafter referred to as the &quot;Porciuncula River&quot;. In later years, the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; part of Crespi&#x27;s lengthy name won out.

=== Possession by the United States ===

Control of California, along with the rest of the northern part of the republic of Mexico, was wrested by the United States in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). California became a state in 1850, and the Los Angeles area began to boom the following year. Generations of settlers and city managers drained, rerouted, polluted and overpopulated the river and its watershed.

The river was originally an alluvial river that ran freely across a flood plain that is now occupied by Los Angeles, Long Beach, and other townships in Southern California. Its path was unstable and unpredictable, and the mouth of the river moved frequently from one place to another between Long Beach and Ballona Creek. Floods damaged extensive amounts of farmland, destroying houses and killing people and livestock. Severe flooding encouraged those living near the river to adapt and construct further away from the river in order to prevent loss from flooding. In the early 19th century, the river turned southwest after leaving the Glendale Narrows, where it joined Ballona Creek and discharged into Santa Monica Bay in present Marina del Rey. However, this account is challenged by Col. J. J. Warner, in his &quot;Historical Sketch of Los Angeles County&quot;:&quot;...until 1825 it was seldom, if in any year, that the river discharged even during the rainy season its waters into the sea. Instead of having a river way to the sea, the waters spread over the country, filling the depressions in the surface and forming lakes, ponds and marshes. The river water, if any, that reached the ocean drained off from the land at so many places, and in such small volumes, that no channel existed until the flood of 1825, which, by cutting a river way to tide water, drained the marsh land and caused the forests to disappear.&quot;The river was long joined by the San Gabriel River in present-day Long Beach, but in the Great Flood of 1862, the San Gabriel carved out a new course to the east, and has discharged into Alamitos Bay ever since. The arrival of the railroad accelerated the advancement in urbanization, as various government bodies subdued the river by reducing its flow. Until the 1900s the river was known to supply enough water to incorporate a system of wells to be built in order to supply freshwater to the city.

=== 20th century ===
The Los Angeles Aqueduct was opened in 1913. The heavy flow of the Los Angeles River presented many issues, as it began to get exploited as a sewer system. Along with these uses, populations surrounding the river often tossed feces and waste into the river, along with dead dogs and horses (and the occasional dead human), in hopes that they would get washed down stream and released to the open ocean waters.

=== War on Water Rights ===

In the early 1920s, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (led by the Los Angeles Board of Water and Power Commissioners) negotiated and gradually purchased almost all of Owens Valley farms and their corresponding water rights. The farmers with the most water banded together to form the Owens Valley Irrigation District in order to try to secure a better deal. When the Owens Valley Irrigation District did not succeed, they created three smaller groups in order to try to bargain. These groups were turbulent in their efforts; resorting to violence, trying to get the attention of state and national press, and calling for politician interference to support their demands for more compensation. This conflict was so highly disputed that the national press referred to it as &quot;California&#x27;s Little Civil War.&quot;

The St. Francis Dam was built starting in 1924 (and through 1926), leading to the creation of a large reservoir in San Francisquito Canyon, and provided water for Los Angeles. The dam collapsed in 1928.

The 1930s in particular saw rapid urban development in areas prone to river flooding. Despite smaller mitigation efforts than the St. Francis Dam, unpredictable and devastating floods continued to plague it well into the 1930s, including:
* Crescenta Valley flood (1933 and 1934) - a flood on New Year&#x27;s Eve and New Year&#x27;s Day devastated the communities of La Crescenta, Montrose, La Cañada, and Tujunga.
* Los Angeles Flood of 1938 - This flood precipitated the recall of then-mayor of Los Angeles Frank L. Shaw, leading to calls for flood control measures.

The incidents resulted in the US Army Corps of Engineers beginning an ambitious project of encasing the river&#x27;s bed and banks in concrete. The only portions of the river that are not paved over are in the flood-control basin behind the Sepulveda Dam near Van Nuys; an 11-mile (17.7-km) stretch east of Griffith Park known as the Glendale Narrows; and along its last few miles in Long Beach.

=== After World War II ===
The river was dry for nine months of the year as late as the 1950s. According to an August 2013 article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the water in the river today is largely &quot;industrial and residential discharge,&quot; which originates from the &quot;two giant pipes that collect the sewage from the homes of 800,000 San Fernando Valley residents&quot; that lead to the Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, &quot;before crashing over a man-made waterfall into Lake Balboa. That body of water, along with two smaller ones, puts 23 million gallons of water a day into the river at Sepulveda Basin.&quot;

Despite the heavy flood flows of the river during winter months, the LA river has become a refuge for marginalized communities, such as migrant, homeless, and diverse sociocultural communities. For a time, the river itself was a geographical divide between East L.A., which is largely Latino, and predominantly white, wealthy West L.A. These minority groups established themselves along the banks of the river, using fish for food. A distinguished link between the LA river and marginalization can be seen through time as a 1909 New York Times article describes these communities as poor transient communities that consume diseased fish to sustain themselves.

Remediation efforts in order to tame the river along with the construction of highways in the 1950s and 1960s displaced hundreds of thousands of individuals. These implications lead to poor air quality and increased exposure to diseases that inhibit good health.

==Points of interest==
Sepulveda Basin is a flood-control basin to manage floodwater runoff. Except for infrequent but dramatic flood episodes, this dry-land flood control basin, most of which is leased from the Corps by the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, plays host to diverse uses today including athletic fields, agriculture, golf courses, a fishing lake, parklands, a sewage treatment facility, and a wildlife reserve.
The Los Angeles River bicycle path runs through the Glendale Narrows and is accessible to the public at its north end at Riverside Drive, at Los Feliz Boulevard, and at its south end at Glendale Boulevard, Fletcher Drive and at Egret Park in Elysian Valley. The bike path runs parallel to the 5 freeway for the majority of its length and has mile markers and call boxes for information and safety purposes.

Rio de Los Angeles State Park is north of downtown Los Angeles in the neighborhood of Cypress Park on the east bank of the river. The park includes restored wetlands featuring native plants as well as recreational activities.

The river&#x27;s southern stretch forms the heart of an industrial corridor, stretching nearly unbroken from Lincoln Heights to Long Beach. In this area, the busy Long Beach Freeway (I-710) and several high-voltage power lines run within a few hundred feet of the riverbed. Several rail yards are located along the river&#x27;s banks in this stretch, as well.
Just outside the industrial corridor lie some of the most densely populated cities in the state of California, such as the cities of Bell, Bell Gardens, Cudahy, Maywood and South Gate; most of these cities are in the river&#x27;s flood plain and experienced significant flooding prior to channelization.

==Wildlife==
Historically, the native species of fish in the Los Angeles River included rainbow/steelhead trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;), river shrimp, Chinook salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;), Sacramento pikeminnow (&quot;Ptychocheilus grandis&quot;), Pacific lamprey, three-spined stickleback, and Santa Ana sucker. In 1877 Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria published a book about his 1876 visit to Los Angeles, entitled &quot;Los Angeles in Südcalifornien. Eine Blume aus dem goldenen Land&quot; (&quot;Los Angeles in Southern California. A Flower from the Golden Land&quot;) which included a description of the fish in the Los Angeles River: &quot;the salmon, Quinnat salmon (Salmo quinnat), abundant between November and June; two kinds of trout, the brook trout (Salar iridea); and the salmon trout (Ptychocheilus grandis).&quot; These three species are known today as the Chinook salmon, steelhead/rainbow trout, and Sacramento pikeminnow. The native species of the Los Angeles River were extirpated by the conversion of the natural riverbed into a concrete trapezoidal channel in 1938. The last known native species to be caught in the river was a rainbow trout in 1940 by a local fisherman.

There is an abundance today of non-native fish species in the Los Angeles River which include common carp, largemouth bass, tilapia, green sunfish, Amazon sailfin catfish, bluegill, black bullhead, brown bullhead, channel catfish, fathead minnow, crayfish, and mosquito fish. However, Arroyo chub, which was once thought gone since the channelization, has made small appearances throughout parts of the Los Angeles River, Most recent being in the area of Balboa Lake/Anthony C. Beilenson Park in the surrounding channels such as Bull Creek, Woodley Creek and around the creeks and main body of the Sepulveda Basin Wildlife Reserve.

There is also a large variety of bird species in the Los Angeles River which include snowy egret, great egret, black-necked stilt, great blue heron, green heron, mallard, cinnamon teal, American coot, Muscovy duck, white pelican, Canada goose, osprey, California high desert mourning dove, black-chinned hummingbird, barn owl, and red tailed hawk. All of these species either nest or live off of the resources of the river.
Before the river&#x27;s channelization the river supported a variety of mammals which included the California golden bear (removed 1897), grey wolf (removed 1890s), coyote, mule deer, and North American beaver.

There is indirect evidence that North American beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) were native to the river, as the Beñemé (Mojave) and Jeniguechi (San Jacinto branch of the Cahuilla) Indians of the San Gabriel Mission were described by Father Pedro Font on the second de Anza Expedition in 1776, &quot;The costume of the men in heathendom is total nakedness, while the women wear a bit of deer skin with which they cover themselves, and likewise an occasional cloak of beaver or rabbit skin, although the fathers endeavor to clothe the converted Indians with something as best they can.&quot; The Tongva or Gabrieleño Indians of Mission San Gabriel had a word for beaver &quot;To-le-vah-che&quot;.

==Revitalization==
The ongoing efforts to revitalize the river began in earnest in approximately 2002. A number of city and county departments, committees and non-profit organizations have led the revitalization efforts. Since the 1938 floods and the subsequent concreting of the river channel, actual restoration of the River to its natural state is no longer possible or necessarily desirable, in most of the 51 mile river, lest new flooding occur.

Studies in the 1980s included a freeway to be used during the dry season to alleviate traffic congestion, and use as a path for hovercraft.

In 2011, the creation of the L.A. River Recreation Zone legalized recreational use in the area. Since then, there have been countless projects to restore recreational use, including a 2.5 mile section of the Glendale Narrows that opened to the public for unrestricted recreational use between Memorial Day and Labor Day in 2013. In May 2014 it was announced that two sections of the river would again be open for recreational use during the summer.

The Los Angeles City Council formed an ad hoc committee in 2002 to focus on accessing and revitalizing the river that was chaired by Councilmember Ed Reyes. The California Coastal Conservancy, a state agency, published its Los Angeles River Park and Recreation Study in 1993, identifying potential projects along the river. In 2006, Los Angeles Mayor Villaraigosa visited South Korea to look at their river restoration project for the Cheonggyecheon.

As a result of the Ad Hoc River Committee&#x27;s efforts, and with funding from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the City of Los Angeles&#x27; Department of Public Works - Bureau of Engineering issued a request for proposals in 2005 for the preparation of a Revitalization Master Plan, which would identify proposals that would make the Los Angeles River a &quot;front door&quot; to the city, and support civic activities. The city&#x27;s Los Angeles River Revitalization Master Plan was adopted in 2007.

One of the key recommendations made by the master plan was the establishment of a non-profit development corporation, with a board appointed by the then Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and certain members of L.A. City Council, to carry out many of its recommended projects. In September 2009, the first board meeting of the LA River Revitalization Corporation was held. Startup funding was provided by the CRA. Harry B. Chandler was elected first chair of the board, and Omar Brownson was hired in 2010 to be the founding executive director. The first development project undertaken by LARRC was creating a public-private partnership to create the first pedestrian, bike and equestrian bridge across the river. Developer Mort La Kretz provided the seed financing for the bridge, which was built next to the 5 freeway in the Elysian Valley by the Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering and completed in 2020.

On July 23, 2013, the LARRC announced a goal of completing a continuous 51-mile (82 km) greenway and bike path along the river by the end of the decade. The path is envisioned to be the central focus of a linear recreational park as well as providing an alternative transportation path through Los Angeles.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; first reported in 2015 that the renowned architect Frank Gehry was collaborating with the LARRC (whose name was changed to River LA). In 2017, Gehry Partners and River LA produced an informational database on the River known as the LA River Index.

In 2018, the County of Los Angeles opted to update their River Masterplan. Geosyntec was hired to lead the effort, with Gehry Partners, RiverLA and OLIN taking on additional responsibilities. In 2019, Gehry revealed to Alta Magazine that he is working on designing several projects along the River, including a cultural center in Southgate.

On September 13, 2013, the Army Corps of Engineers recommended a $453 million plan to restore nearly 600 acres of wildlife habitat – much of that located between Griffith Park and Lincoln Heights – as the best option to restore the river&#x27;s ecosystem while preserving the flood protection provided by the concrete encasement. Subsequently, all Federal funding for the plan has been on hold. In early 2016, there was some dispute as to federal funding for river cleanup after winter storms. As part of Proposition 68 in California in June 2018, later that year, grants were given for the cleanup of invasive plants along part of the river. As a result, in 2018, Los Angeles and its LARiverWorks policy team had a project underway for &quot;every mile of the river within city limits, aiming to improve connectivity, increase open space, and restore habitat. New bridges and trails will accommodate people on foot, bikes, or horseback.&quot; Plans to cleanup 11 miles of river north of downtown Los Angeles, in the hopes of attracting steelhead trout, will cost $1.1 billion. In February 2019, the Los Angeles County Flood Control District was informing the federal government that it wanted to take control of about 40 miles of channels owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

=== 2020 LA River Master Plan ===

In 2020, Los Angeles County released an updated LA River Master Plan detailing plans for the river over the next 25 years. The current plan addresses 9 goals related to flood risk, parks, ecosystems, access, arts and culture, housing, engagement and education, water supply, and water quality. The plan for decreasing flood risk consists of preserving and increasing flood risk capacity, reducing flow into the river, incorporating climate change research, and increasing emergency planning, public awareness, and management practices. In order to create inclusive, open areas, LA county&#x27;s actions include making 51 continuous miles of open space, finishing the LA River Trail, providing amenities, implementing multi-use functionality, and promoting public safety. The third goal of the 2020 LA River Master Plan is to support flourishing ecosystems by increasing habitat and ecosystem function, improve plant biodiversity including native species, connecting habitat to support wildlife, and increasing environmentally-friendly practices. The LA county goal of equal access to the river is outlined by creating access points and gateways and promoting safe transportation to the river. The objective of enhancing arts and culture is planned to be achieved by creating a 51-mile arts and culture corridor, identifying and supporting cultures, and involving artists and cultural groups in the design process. The next goal outlined in the LA River Master Plan addresses impacts to the housing economy and the homeless community through incorporating the Affordable Housing Coordinating Committee in planning, creating mapping and assessment tools, increasing affordable housing, securing funding, and enhancing outreach to homeless populations. The actions to enhance engagement and education include providing spaces for all ages to learn, developing new educational materials, involving aspects from indigenous peoples, and promoting the river as an economic asset to nearby communities. The eighth goal in the master plan is to improve water supply through diverting and treating stormwater and dry weather flows before they flow into the river, supporting efficient water usage, creating better operations, maintenance, and measures. The final goal is to improve water quality by developing water quality projects, working with watershed management groups, raising public awareness, and improving facility operations and maintenance.

=== Friends of the Los Angeles River ===

Friends of the Los Angeles River (FoLAR) was founded in 1986 by poet and activist Lewis P. Macadams. Originally deemed a &quot;40-year artwork to bring the River back to life,&quot; FoLAR was the first organization advocating for habitat restoration and public access on the LA River.

One FoLAR&#x27;s more prominent ongoing projects is the annual Great LA River Cleanup, which began in 1988 with a group of less than twenty people. In 2017, the Great LA Cleanup had up to 10,000 volunteers over three weekends covering the upper, middle, and lower sections of the River. In 2016, an estimated 5,000 volunteers took place in the annual cleanup, including the mayor and several elected officials. In 2018, more than 6,000 volunteers removed more than 60 tons of trash at nine sites along the Los Angeles River. In 2019, the FoLAR cleanup was the largest river cleanup in the United States. The cleanup marked 30 years in 2019. By the summer of 2019, kayaking in Los Angeles in the river had become common. As of 2018, FoLAR has adopted a year-round cleanup model through partnerships with other environmental organizations like Heal the Bay, and through service opportunities for corporate groups and large organizations through River Makers program.

In 2012, FoLAR raised a $1 million donation to support the completion of the ARBOR study by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). This study ultimately resulted in the adoption of Alternative 20, a restoration plan focused on 719 acres of habitat and pedestrian-friendly improvements, among other things.

<text>The 1999 ICC Cricket World Cup, also branded as England &#x27;99, was the seventh edition of the Cricket World Cup, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was hosted primarily by England, with selected matches also played in Wales, Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands. The tournament was won by Australia, who beat Pakistan by 8 wickets in the final at Lord&#x27;s in London.

The tournament was hosted three years after the previous Cricket World Cup, deviating from the usual four-year gap.

==Format==
It featured 12 teams, playing a total of 42 matches. In the group stage, the teams were divided into two groups of six; each team played all the others in their group once. The top three teams from each group advanced to the Super Sixes, a new concept for the 1999 World Cup; each team carried forward the points from the games against the other qualifiers from their group and then played each of the qualifiers from the other group (in other words, each qualifier from Group A played each qualifier from Group B and vice versa). The top four teams in the Super Sixes advanced to the semi-finals.

==Qualification==
The 1999 World Cup featured 12 teams, which was the same as the previous edition in 1996. The hosts England and the eight other test nations earned automatic qualification to the World Cup. The remaining three spots were decided at the 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia.

22 nations competed in the 1997 edition of the ICC Trophy. After going through two group stages, the semi-finals saw Kenya and Bangladesh qualify through to the World Cup. Scotland would be the third nation to qualify as they defeated Ireland in the third-place playoff.
==Venues==
===England===
===Outside England===
Scotland played two of their Group B matches in their home country becoming the first associate nation to host games in a World Cup. One Group B match was played in Wales and Ireland respectively, while one Group A match was played in the Netherlands.

===Pool B===
















==Super Six==
Teams who qualified for the Super Six stage only played against the teams from the other group; results against the other teams from the same group were carried forward to this stage. Results against the non-qualifying teams were therefore discarded at this point.

As a result of League match losses against New Zealand and Pakistan, even though Australia finished second in their group, they progressed to the Super Six stage with no points carried forward (PCF). India faced similar circumstances, finishing 2nd in their group but carrying forward 0 points after losing to fellow qualifiers Zimbabwe and South Africa.

During their super six clash, Pakistan and India were officially at war at the time of their match, the only time this has ever happened in the history of the sport.

==Statistics==

==Match balls==

A new type of cricket ball, the white &#x27;Duke&#x27;, was introduced for the first time in the 1999 World Cup. British Cricket Balls Ltd claimed that the balls behaved identically to the balls used in previous World Cups, experiments showed they were harder and swung more.

==Media==

The host broadcasters for television coverage of the tournament were Sky and BBC Television. In the UK, live games were divided between the broadcasters, with both screening the final live. This was to be BBC&#x27;s last live cricket coverage during that summer, with all of England&#x27;s home Test series being shown on Channel 4 or Sky from 1999 onwards; the BBC did not show any live cricket again until August 2020.

<text>Land art, variously known as Earth art, environmental art, and Earthworks, is an art movement that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, largely associated with Great Britain and the United States but that also includes examples from many countries. As a trend, &quot;land art&quot; expanded boundaries of art by the materials used and the siting of the works. The materials used were often the materials of the Earth, including the soil, rocks, vegetation, and water found on-site, and the sites of the works were often distant from population centers. Though sometimes fairly inaccessible, photo documentation was commonly brought back to the urban art gallery.

Concerns of the art movement centered around rejection of the commercialization of art-making and enthusiasm with an emergent ecological movement. The art movement coincided with the popularity of the rejection of urban living and its counterpart, an enthusiasm for that which is rural. Included in these inclinations were spiritual yearnings concerning the planet Earth as home to humanity.

==Form==



The art form gained traction in the 1960s and 1970s as land art was not something that could easily be turned into a commodity, unlike the &quot;mass produced cultural debris&quot; of the time. During this period, proponents of land art rejected the museum or gallery as the setting of artistic activity and developed monumental landscape projects which were beyond the reach of traditional transportable sculpture and the commercial art market, although photographic documentation was often presented in normal gallery spaces. Land art was inspired by minimal art and conceptual art but also by modern movements such as De Stijl, Cubism, minimalism and the work of Constantin Brâncuși and Joseph Beuys. One of the first earthworks artists was Herbert Bayer, who created Grass Mound in Aspen, Colorado, in 1955.

Many of the artists associated with land art had been involved with minimal art and conceptual art. Isamu Noguchi&#x27;s 1941 design for &quot;Contoured Playground&quot; in New York City is sometimes interpreted as an important early piece of land art even though the artist himself never called his work &quot;land art&quot; but simply &quot;sculpture&quot;. His influence on contemporary land art, landscape architecture and environmental sculpture is evident in many works today.

Alan Sonfist used an alternative approach to working with nature and culture by bringing historical nature and sustainable art back into New York City. His most inspirational work is &quot;Time Landscape&quot;, an indigenous forest he planted in New York City. He created several other &quot;Time Landscapes&quot; around the world such as &quot;Circles of Time&quot; in Florence, Italy documenting the historical usage of the land, and at the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum outside Boston. According to critic Barbara Rose, writing in &quot;Artforum&quot; in 1969, he had become disillusioned with the commodification and insularity of gallery bound art. Dian Parker wrote in ArtNet, &quot;The artist’s ecological message seems more timely now than ever, noted Adam Weinberg, the director emeritus of the Whitney Museum of American Art. &#x27;Since the ’60s, [Sonfist has] continued to push forward his ideas about the land, particularly urgent right now with global warming all over the world. We need solutions to climate change not only from scientists and politicians but also from artists, envisioning and realizing a greener, more primordial future.&#x27;&quot; 

In 1967, the art critic Grace Glueck writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared the first Earthwork to be done by Douglas Leichter and Richard Saba at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. The sudden appearance of land art in 1968 can be located as a response by a generation of artists mostly in their late twenties to the heightened political activism of the year and the emerging environmental and women&#x27;s liberation movements.

One example of land art in the 20th century was a group exhibition called &quot;Earthworks&quot; created in 1968 at the Dwan Gallery in New York. In February 1969, Willoughby Sharp curated the &quot;Earth Art&quot; exhibition at the Andrew Dickson White Museum of Art at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. The artists included were Walter De Maria, Jan Dibbets, Hans Haacke, Michael Heizer, Neil Jenney, Richard Long, David Medalla, Robert Morris, Dennis Oppenheim, Robert Smithson, and Gunther Uecker. The exhibition was directed by Thomas W. Leavitt. Gordon Matta-Clark, who lived in Ithaca at the time, was invited by Sharp to help the artists in &quot;Earth Art&quot; with the on-site execution of their works for the exhibition.

Perhaps the best known artist who worked in this genre was Robert Smithson whose 1968 essay &quot;The Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects&quot; provided a critical framework for the movement as a reaction to the disengagement of Modernism from social issues as represented by the critic Clement Greenberg. His best known piece, and probably the most famous piece of all land art, is the &quot;Spiral Jetty&quot; (1970), for which Smithson arranged rock, earth and algae so as to form a long (1500 ft) spiral-shape jetty protruding into Great Salt Lake in northern Utah, U.S. How much of the work, if any, is visible is dependent on the fluctuating water levels. Since its creation, the work has been completely covered, and then uncovered again, by water. A steward of the artwork in conjunction with the Dia Foundation, the Utah Museum of Fine Arts regularly curates programming around the Spiral Jetty, including a &quot;Family Backpacks&quot; program. 

Smithson&#x27;s &quot;Gravel Mirror with Cracks and Dust&quot; (1968) is an example of land art existing in a gallery space rather than in the natural environment. It consists of a pile of gravel by the side of a partially mirrored gallery wall. In its simplicity of form and concentration on the materials themselves, this and other pieces of land art have an affinity with minimalism. There is also a relationship to Arte Povera in the use of materials traditionally considered &quot;unartistic&quot; or &quot;worthless&quot;. The Italian Germano Celant, founder of Arte Povera, was one of the first curators to promote land art.

&quot;Land artists&quot; have tended to be American, with other prominent artists in this field being Carl Andre, Alice Aycock, Walter De Maria, Hans Haacke, Michael Heizer, Nancy Holt, Peter Hutchinson, Ana Mendieta, Dennis Oppenheim, Andrew Rogers, Charles Ross, Alan Sonfist, and James Turrell. Turrell began work in 1972 on possibly the largest piece of land art thus far, reshaping the earth surrounding the extinct Roden Crater volcano in Arizona. Perhaps the most prominent non-American land artists are the British Chris Drury, Andy Goldsworthy, Richard Long and the Australian Andrew Rogers.
In 1973 Jacek Tylicki begins to lay out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.

Some projects by the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude (who are famous for wrapping monuments, buildings and landscapes in fabric) have also been considered land art by some, though the artists themselves consider this incorrect. Joseph Beuys&#x27;s concept of &quot;social sculpture&quot; influenced &quot;land art&quot;, and his *7000 Eichen* project of 1982 to plant 7,000 Oak trees has many similarities to land art processes. Rogers&#x27; “Rhythms of Life” project is the largest contemporary land-art undertaking in the world, forming a chain of stone sculptures, or geoglyphs, around the globe – 12 sites – in disparate exotic locations (from below sea level and up to altitudes of 4,300 m/14,107 ft). Up to three geoglyphs (ranging in size up to 40,000 sq m/430,560 sq ft) are located in each site.

Land artists in America relied mostly on wealthy patrons and private foundations to fund their often costly projects. With the sudden economic downturn of the mid-1970s, funds from these sources largely stopped. With the death of Robert Smithson in a plane crash in 1973, the movement lost one of its most important figureheads and faded out. Charles Ross continues to work on the &quot;Star Axis&quot; project, which he began in 1971. 

Michael Heizer in 2022 completed his work on &quot;City&quot;, and James Turrell continues to work on the &quot;Roden Crater&quot; project. In most respects, &quot;land art&quot; has become part of mainstream public art and in many cases the term &quot;land art&quot; is misused to label any kind of art in nature even though conceptually not related to the avant-garde works by the pioneers of land art.

The Earth art of the 1960s were sometimes reminiscent of much older land works, such as Stonehenge, the Pyramids, Native American mounds, the Nazca Lines in Peru, Carnac stones, and Native American burial grounds, and often evoked the spirituality of such archeological sites.

<doc id="180869" wikidata="Q506645" url="?curid=180869" title="Paulinus of York">
<text>Paulinus (died 10 October 644) was a Roman missionary and the first Bishop of York. A member of the Gregorian mission sent in 601 by Pope Gregory I to Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism, Paulinus arrived in England by 604 with the second missionary group. Little is known of Paulinus&#x27;s activities in the following two decades.

After some years spent in Kent, perhaps in 625, Paulinus was consecrated a bishop. He accompanied Æthelburg of Kent, sister of King Eadbald of Kent, on her journey to Northumbria to marry King Edwin of Northumbria, and eventually succeeded in converting Edwin to Christianity. Paulinus also converted many of Edwin&#x27;s subjects and built some churches. One of the women Paulinus baptised was a future saint, Hilda of Whitby. 

Following Edwin&#x27;s death in 633, Paulinus and Æthelburg fled Northumbria, leaving behind a member of Paulinus&#x27;s clergy, James the Deacon. Paulinus returned to Kent, where he became Bishop of Rochester. He received a pallium from the pope, symbolizing his appointment as Archbishop of York, but too late to be effective. After his death in 644, Paulinus was canonized as a saint and is now venerated in the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Anglican Churches.

==Early life==
Paulinus was a monk from Rome sent to the Kingdom of Kent by Pope Gregory I in 601, along with Mellitus and others, as part of the second group of missionaries sent to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity. He was probably an Italian by birth. The second group of missionaries arrived in Kent by 604, but little is known of Paulinus&#x27;s further activities until he went to Northumbria.

Paulinus remained in Kent until 625, when he was consecrated as bishop by Justus, the Archbishop of Canterbury, on 21 July. He then accompanied Æthelburg, the sister of King Eadbald of Kent, to Northumbria where she was to marry King Edwin of Northumbria. A condition of the marriage was that Edwin had promised that he would allow Æthelburg to remain a Christian and worship as she chose. Bede, writing in the early 8th century, reports that Paulinus wished to convert the Northumbrians, as well as provide religious services to the new queen.

There is some difficulty with Bede&#x27;s chronology on the date of Æthelburh&#x27;s marriage, as surviving papal letters to Edwin urging him to convert imply that Eadbald only recently had become a Christian, which conflicts with Bede&#x27;s chronology. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that Paulinus and Æthelburh must therefore have gone to Northumbria earlier than 624, and that Paulinus went north, not as a bishop, but as a priest, returning later to be consecrated. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting agrees with Kirby&#x27;s reasoning. Another historian, Peter Hunter Blair, argues that Æthelburh and Edwin were married before 625, but that she did not go to Northumbria until 625. If Kirby&#x27;s arguments are accepted, then the date of Paulinus&#x27;s consecration needs to be changed by a year, to 21 July 626.

Bede describes Paulinus as &quot;a man tall of stature, a little stooping, with black hair and a thin face, a hooked and thin nose, his aspect both venerable and awe-inspiring&quot;.

==Bishop of York==

Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin that the birth of his and Æthelburg&#x27;s daughter at Easter 626 was because of Paulinus&#x27;s prayers. The birth coincided with a foiled assassination attempt on the king by a group of West Saxons from Wessex. Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter Eanflæd to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex. He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however, only converting after Paulinus had revealed the details of a dream the king had before he took the throne, during his exile at the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia. In this dream, according to Bede, a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone laid a hand on his head. As Paulinus was revealing the dream to Edwin, he laid his hand on the king&#x27;s head, which was the proof Edwin needed. A late seventh-century hagiography of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision; if true, it might suggest that Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald&#x27;s court, although Bede does not mention any such visit.

It is unlikely that supernatural affairs and Paulinus&#x27;s persuasion alone caused Edwin to convert. The Northumbrian nobles seem to have been willing and the king also received letters from Pope Boniface V urging his conversion. Eventually convinced, Edwin and many of his followers were baptised at York in 627. One story relates that during a stay with Edwin and Æthelburg at their palace in Yeavering, Paulinus spent 36 days baptising new converts. Paulinus also was an active missionary in Lindsey, and his missionary activities help show the limits of Edwin&#x27;s royal authority.

Pope Gregory&#x27;s plan had been that York would be England&#x27;s second metropolitan see, so Paulinus established his church there. Although built of stone, no trace of it has been found. Paulinus also built several churches on royal estates. His church in Lincoln has been identified with the earliest building phase of the church of St Paul in the Bail.

Among those baptised by Paulinus were Hilda, later the founding abbess of Whitby Abbey, and Hilda&#x27;s successor, Eanflæd, Edwin&#x27;s daughter. As the only Roman bishop in England, Paulinus also consecrated another Gregorian missionary, Honorius, as Archbishop of Canterbury after Justus&#x27; death, sometime between 628 and 631.

==Bishop of Rochester==
Edwin was defeated by an alliance of Gwynedd Welsh and Mercian Angles, being killed at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius I wrote in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius saying that he was sending a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop&#x27;s authority, to each of them. The pope&#x27;s letter shows no hint that news of Edwin&#x27;s death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it more likely that the battle occurred in 634.

Edwin&#x27;s defeat and death caused his kingdom to fragment into at least two parts. It also led to a sharp decline in Christianity in Northumbria when Edwin&#x27;s immediate successors reverted to paganism. Widowed queen Æthelburg fled to her brother Eadbald&#x27;s Kent kingdom. Paulinus went with her, along with Edwin and Æthelburg&#x27;s son, daughter, and grandson. The two boys went to the continent for safety, to the court of King Dagobert I. Æthelburg, Eanflæd, and Paulinus remained in Kent, where Paulinus was offered the see, or bishopric, of Rochester, which he held until his death. Because the pallium did not reach Paulinus until after he had left York, it was of no use to him. Paulinus&#x27;s deputy, James the Deacon, remained in the north and struggled to rebuild the Roman mission.

==Death and veneration==
Paulinus died on 10 October 644 at Rochester, where he was buried in the sacristy of the church. His successor at Rochester was Ithamar, the first Englishman consecrated to a Gregorian missionary see. After Paulinus&#x27;s death, Paulinus was revered as a saint, with a feast day on 10 October. When a new church was constructed at Rochester in the 1080s his relics, or remains, were translated (ritually moved) to a new shrine. There also were shrines to Paulinus at Canterbury, and at least five churches were dedicated to him. Although Rochester held some of Paulinus&#x27;s relics, the promotion of his cult there appears to have occurred after the Norman Conquest. He is considered a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Paulinus&#x27;s missionary efforts are difficult to evaluate. Bede implies that the mission in Northumbria was successful, but there is little supporting evidence, and it is more likely that Paulinus&#x27;s missionary efforts there were relatively ineffectual. Although Osric, one of Edwin&#x27;s successors, was converted to Christianity by Paulinus, he returned to paganism after Edwin&#x27;s death. Hilda, however, remained a Christian, and eventually went on to become abbess of the influential Whitby Abbey. Northumbria&#x27;s conversion to Christianity was mainly achieved by Irish missionaries brought into the region by Edwin&#x27;s eventual successor, Oswald.

<doc id="180870" wikidata="Q380528" url="?curid=180870" title="Color charge">
<text>Color charge is a property of quarks and gluons that is related to the particles&#x27; strong interactions in the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Like electric charge, it determines how quarks and gluons interact through the strong force; however, rather than there being only positive and negative charges, there are three &quot;charges&quot;, commonly called red, green, and blue. Additionally, there are three &quot;anti-colors&quot;, commonly called anti-red, anti-green, and anti-blue. Unlike electric charge, color charge is never observed in nature: in all cases, red, green, and blue (or anti-red, anti-green, and anti-blue) or any color and its anti-color combine to form a &quot;color-neutral&quot; system. For example, the three quarks making up any baryon universally have three different color charges, and the two quarks making up any meson universally have opposite color charge.

The &quot;color charge&quot; of quarks and gluons is completely unrelated to the everyday meaning of color, which refers to the frequency of photons, the particles that mediate a different fundamental force, electromagnetism. The term &quot;color&quot; and the labels red, green, and blue became popular simply because of the loose but convenient analogy to the primary colors.

== History ==
Shortly after the existence of quarks was proposed by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964, color charge was implicitly introduced the same year by Oscar W. Greenberg. In 1965, Moo-Young Han and Yoichiro Nambu explicitly introduced color as a gauge symmetry. 

Han and Nambu initially designated this degree of freedom by the group SU(3), but it was referred to in later papers as &quot;the three-triplet model&quot;. One feature of the model (which was originally preferred by Han and Nambu) was that it permitted integrally charged quarks, as well as the fractionally charged quarks initially proposed by Zweig and Gell-Mann. 

Somewhat later, in the early 1970s, Gell-Mann, in several conference talks, coined the name &quot;color&quot; to describe the internal degree of freedom of the three-triplet model, and advocated a new field theory, designated as &quot;quantum chromodynamics&quot; (QCD) to describe the interaction of quarks and gluons within hadrons. In Gell-Mann&#x27;s QCD, each quark and gluon has fractional electric charge, and carries what came to be called &quot;color charge&quot; in the space of the color degree of freedom.

== Red, green, and blue ==
In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a quark&#x27;s color can take one of three values or charges: red, green, and blue. An antiquark can take one of three anticolors: called antired, antigreen, and antiblue (represented as cyan, magenta, and yellow, respectively). Gluons are mixtures of two colors, such as red and antigreen, which constitutes their color charge. QCD considers eight gluons of the possible nine color–anticolor combinations to be unique; see &quot;eight gluon colors&quot; for an explanation.

All three colors mixed together, all three anticolors mixed together, or a combination of a color and its anticolor is &quot;colorless&quot; or &quot;white&quot; and has a net color charge of zero. Due to a property of the strong interaction called color confinement, free particles must have a color charge of zero. 

A baryon is composed of three quarks, which must be one each of red, green, and blue colors; likewise an antibaryon is composed of three antiquarks, one each of antired, antigreen and antiblue. A meson is made from one quark and one antiquark; the quark can be any color, and the antiquark has the matching anticolor.

The following illustrates the coupling constants for color-charged particles:

=== Field lines from color charges ===

Analogous to an electric field and electric charges, the strong force acting between color charges can be depicted using field lines. However, the color field lines do not arc outwards from one charge to another as much, because they are pulled together tightly by gluons (within 1 fm). This effect confines quarks within hadrons.

== Coupling constant and charge ==
In a quantum field theory, a coupling constant and a charge are different but related notions. The coupling constant sets the magnitude of the force of interaction; for example, in quantum electrodynamics, the fine-structure constant is a coupling constant. The charge in a gauge theory has to do with the way a particle transforms under the gauge symmetry; i.e., its representation under the gauge group. For example, the electron has charge −1 and the positron has charge +1, implying that the gauge transformation has opposite effects on them in some sense. Specifically, if a local gauge transformation is applied in electrodynamics, then one finds (using tensor index notation):formula_1
where formula_2 is the photon field, and is the electron field with (a bar over denotes its antiparticle — the positron). Since QCD is a non-abelian theory, the representations, and hence the color charges, are more complicated. They are dealt with in the next section.

== Quark and gluon fields ==

In QCD the gauge group is the non-abelian group SU(3). The &quot;running coupling&quot; is usually denoted by formula_3. Each flavour of quark belongs to the fundamental representation (3) and contains a triplet of fields together denoted by formula_4. The antiquark field belongs to the complex conjugate representation (3*) and also contains a triplet of fields. We can write
: formula_5  and  formula_6
The gluon contains an octet of fields (see gluon field), and belongs to the adjoint representation (8), and can be written using the Gell-Mann matrices as
: formula_7
(there is an implied summation over &quot;a&quot; = 1, 2, ... 8). All other particles belong to the trivial representation (1) of color SU(3). The color charge of each of these fields is fully specified by the representations. Quarks have a color charge of red, green or blue and antiquarks have a color charge of antired, antigreen or antiblue. Gluons have a combination of two color charges (one of red, green, or blue and one of antired, antigreen, or antiblue) in a superposition of states that are given by the Gell-Mann matrices. All other particles have zero color charge.

The gluons corresponding to formula_8 and formula_9 are sometimes described as having &quot;zero charge&quot; (as in the figure). Formally, these states are written as
:formula_10 and formula_11
While &quot;colorless&quot; in the sense that they consist of matched color-anticolor pairs, which places them in the centre of a weight diagram alongside the truly colorless singlet state, they still participate in strong interactions - in particular, those in which quarks interact without changing color.

Mathematically speaking, the color charge of a particle is the value of a certain quadratic Casimir operator in the representation of the particle.

In the simple language introduced previously, the three indices &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; in the quark triplet above are usually identified with the three colors. The colorful language misses the following point. A gauge transformation in color SU(3) can be written as formula_12, where formula_13 is a matrix that belongs to the group SU(3). Thus, after gauge transformation, the new colors are linear combinations of the old colors. In short, the simplified language introduced before is not gauge invariant.

Color charge is conserved, but the book-keeping involved in this is more complicated than just adding up the charges, as is done in quantum electrodynamics. One simple way of doing this is to look at the interaction vertex in QCD and replace it by a color-line representation. The meaning is the following. Let formula_14 represent the th component of a quark field (loosely called the th color). The &quot;color&quot; of a gluon is similarly given by formula_15, which corresponds to the particular Gell-Mann matrix it is associated with. This matrix has indices and . These are the &quot;color labels&quot; on the gluon. At the interaction vertex one has . The &quot;color-line&quot; representation tracks these indices. Color charge conservation means that the ends of these color lines must be either in the initial or final state, equivalently, that no lines break in the middle of a diagram.

Since gluons carry color charge, two gluons can also interact. A typical interaction vertex (called the three gluon vertex) for gluons involves g + g → g. This is shown here, along with its color-line representation. The color-line diagrams can be restated in terms of conservation laws of color; however, as noted before, this is not a gauge invariant language. Note that in a typical non-abelian gauge theory the gauge boson carries the charge of the theory, and hence has interactions of this kind; for example, the W boson in the electroweak theory. In the electroweak theory, the W also carries electric charge, and hence interacts with a photon.

<doc id="180874" wikidata="Q123258" url="?curid=180874" title="Fukuoka Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located on the island of Kyūshū. Fukuoka Prefecture has a population of 5,109,323 (1 June 2019) and has a geographic area of 4,986 km2 (1,925 sq mi). Fukuoka Prefecture borders Saga Prefecture to the southwest, Kumamoto Prefecture to the south, and Ōita Prefecture to the southeast.

Fukuoka is the capital and largest city of Fukuoka Prefecture, and the largest city on Kyūshū, with other major cities including Kitakyushu, Kurume, and Ōmuta. Fukuoka Prefecture is located at the northernmost point of Kyūshū on the Kanmon Straits, connecting the Tsushima Strait and the Seto Inland Sea across from Yamaguchi Prefecture on the island of Honshu, and extends south towards the Ariake Sea.

==History==

Fukuoka Prefecture includes the former provinces of Chikugo, Chikuzen, and Buzen.

===Shrines and temples===
Kōra taisha, Sumiyoshi-jinja, and Hakozaki-gū are the chief Shinto shrines (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) in the prefecture.

There are several historically important Buddhist temples in the Prefecture. Monks would sail back from China after completing their studies and establish temples in the heart of Hakata (now Fukuoka) City.
Monk Eisai founded Shōfuku-ji which is known today as the oldest zen temple in Japan,
monk Kukai established Tocho-ji, and Joten-ji was built by Enni who is also known for bringing Udon noodles first to Japan.
The oldest temple is Kanzeon-ji that was founded by the Emperor in Dazaifu during the 7th century to honor his mother. Kanzeon-ji together with Kaidan-in, that used to be part of the former, was one of the three distinct places in Japan where Buddhist monks could ordain.

During the Tokugawa shogunate when the country was ruled by 300 local feudal lords (daimyo), an important daimyo, Arima Toyōji was relocated to this region and thus he moved his family temple to Kurume City. This zen temple is known today as Bairin-ji and is a main temple for zen practice in Fukuoka Prefecture and Kyushu. It is located on the West bank of Chiguko River, next to the Shinkansen station of Kurume city.

==Geography==

Fukuoka Prefecture faces the sea on three sides, bordering Saga, Ōita, and Kumamoto prefectures and facing Yamaguchi Prefecture across the Kanmon Straits.

As of 1 April 2012, 18% of the land area of the prefecture was designated as natural parks: Setonaikai National Park, Genkai, Kitakyūshū, and Yaba-Hita-Hikosan quasi-national parks, and Chikugogawa, Chikuhō, Dazaifu, Sefuri Raizan, and Yabegawa Prefectural Natural Parks.

Fukuoka includes the two largest cities on Kyūshū, Fukuoka and Kitakyushu, and much of Kyūshū&#x27;s industry. It also includes a number of small islands near the north coast of Kyūshū.

<text>The Kingdom of the Kentish (; ), today referred to as the Kingdom of Kent, was an early medieval kingdom in what is now South East England. It existed from either the fifth or the sixth century AD until it was fully absorbed into the Kingdom of Wessex in the mid-9th century and later into the Kingdom of England in the early 10th century.

Under the preceding Romano-British administration the area of Kent faced repeated attacks from seafaring raiders during the fourth century AD. It is likely that Germanic-speaking &quot;foederati&quot; were invited to settle in the area as mercenaries. Following the end of Roman administration in 410, further linguistically Germanic tribal groups moved into the area, as testified by both archaeological evidence and Late Anglo-Saxon textual sources. The primary ethnic group to settle in the area appears to have been the Jutes: they established their Kingdom in East Kent and may initially have been under the dominion of the Kingdom of Francia. It has been argued that an East Saxon or Middle Saxon community initially settled in West Kent and merged with the expanding kingdom of East Kent in the sixth century, but this is uncertain.

The earliest recorded king of Kent was Æthelberht, who, as &quot;bretwalda&quot;, wielded significant influence over other Anglo-Saxon kings in the late sixth century. The Christianization of the Anglo-Saxons began in Kent during Æthelberht&#x27;s reign with the arrival of the monk Augustine of Canterbury and his Gregorian mission in 597.

Kent was one of the seven kingdoms of the so-called Anglo-Saxon heptarchy, but it lost its independence in the 8th century when it became a sub-kingdom of Mercia. In the 9th century it became a sub-kingdom of Wessex, and in the 10th century it became part of the unified Kingdom of England that was created under the leadership of Wessex. Its name has been carried forward ever since as the county of Kent.

Knowledge of Anglo-Saxon Kent comes from scholarly study of Late Anglo-Saxon texts such as the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, as well as archaeological evidence such as that left by early medieval cemeteries and settlements, and toponymical (place-name) evidence.

==Decline of Romano-British Kent==

In the Romano-British period, the area of modern Kent that lay east of the River Medway was a &quot;civitas&quot; known as &quot;Cantiaca&quot;. Its name had been taken from an older Common Brittonic place-name, &quot;Cantium&quot; (&quot;corner of land&quot; or &quot;land on the edge&quot;) used in the preceding pre-Roman Iron Age, although the extent of this tribal area is unknown.

During the late third and fourth centuries, Roman Britain had been raided repeatedly by Franks, Saxons, Picts, and Scots. As the closest part of Britain to mainland Europe, it is likely that Kent would have experienced many attacks from seafaring raiders, resulting in the construction of four Saxon Shore Forts along the Kentish coast: Regulbium, Rutupiae, Dubris, and Portus Lemanis. It is also likely that Germanic-speaking mercenaries from northern Gaul, known as &quot;foederati&quot;, would have been hired to supplement official Roman troops during this period, with land in Kent as payment. These &quot;foederati&quot; would have assimilated into Romano-British culture, making it difficult to distinguish them archaeologically.

There is evidence that over the fourth and early fifth centuries, rural villas were abandoned, suggesting that the Romano-British elite were moving to the comparative safety of fortified urban centres. However, urban centres also witnessed decline; Canterbury evidenced a declining population and reduced activity from the late third century onward, while Dover was abandoned by the end of the fourth century. In 407, the Roman legions left Britain in order to deal with incursions into the Empire&#x27;s continental heartlands.

In 410, the Roman Emperor Honorius sent a letter to his British subjects announcing that they must thenceforth look after their own defence and could no longer rely on the imperial military to protect them.
According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, produced in late Anglo-Saxon England and not considered an accurate record of events in the fifth century, in 418 many Romans left Britain via Kent, taking much of their wealth with them. This may represent a memory of a genuine exodus of the Roman aristocracy.

==Early Jutish Kent==
=== Jutish migration: 410–499 ===
According to archaeologist Martin Welch, the fifth century witnessed &quot;a radical transformation of what became Kent, politically, socially and in terms of physical landscape&quot;. There has been much debate as to the scale of Jutish migration; some see it as a mass migration in which large numbers of Germanic peoples left northern Europe to settle in Britain, pushing the native British population to western Britain or Brittany; others have argued that only a small warrior elite came over, dominating (or even enslaving) the Romano-British population, who then began using the Old English language and material culture of the newcomers. Currently, many scholars accept that there was significant regional variation, with the former view being more applicable in the south and east and the latter in the north and west.

In Kent, archaeological and historical evidence suggests that a large-scale immigration of Germanic peoples did indeed take place. However, some of the Romano-British population likely remained, as the Roman name for the area, &quot;Cantiaca&quot;, influenced the name of the new Jutish kingdom, the &quot;Cantware&quot; (&quot;dwellers of Kent&quot;).

The Germanic migration to Britain is noted in textual sources from the late Anglo-Saxon period, most notably Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;; both rely on oral histories from the fifth century, and were attempts to establish origin myths that would justify the politics of the time. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a &quot;king of the Britons&quot; known as Vortigern invited two Germanic leaders, Hengist and Horsa (&quot;stallion&quot; and &quot;horse&quot;), to Britain to help defend against Pictish raiders. After arriving at &quot;Ypwinesfleot&quot; (Ebba&#x27;s Creek, modern Ebbsfleet near Ramsgate) in Kent in 449, Hengist and Horsa led the defeat of the Picts before turning on the British and inviting more Germanic tribes to colonise Britain. Among these were the Old Saxons, the Angles, and the Jutes; the latter settled in Kent and the Isle of Wight, establishing the peoples known as the Cantware and Wihtware.

According to the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, in 455 Hengist and Horsa fought Vortigern at &quot;Ægelesthrep&quot; (probably Aylesford in Kent), in which battle Horsa was killed. Hengist succeeded him as king, followed in turn by his son Æsc. In 456 Hengest and Æsc battled the Britons at &quot;Crecganford&quot; (probably Crayford). The Britons then fled Kent for their London stronghold. A similar account is provided in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;: that the people of Kent and Isle of Wight were descended from Jutish settlers, and that Horsa was killed in battle against the Britons, adding that his body was buried in east Kent. The accuracy of these accounts is questioned; S. E. Kelly states that &quot;the legendary details are easy to dismiss&quot;. Scholars often view Hengist and Horsa as mythological figures borrowed from folk tradition, to legitimise rulers in the Mid-to-Late Anglo-Saxon period.

The incoming Germanic peoples settled on the prime agricultural land of the Romano-Britons; particularly the foothills to the north of the downs and Holmesdale south of the downs escarpment. It is likely that they complemented agriculture with animal husbandry, but with nearby coasts and rivers it is also likely that they engaged in fishing and trading. The Anglo-Saxons made use of pre-existing prehistoric and Roman road systems, with 85% of cemeteries being located within 1.2 km of a Roman road, a navigable river or the coast, and the remaining 15% being close to ancient trackways. Little archaeological evidence of these early settlements exists, but one prominent example is a grubenhaus at Lower Warbank, Keston that was built atop the site of a former Roman villa, adjacent to a Romano-British trackway through the North Downs. Fifth-century ceramics have also been found at a number of villa sites around Kent, suggesting reoccupation of these locations during this period.
In East Kent, fifth century cemeteries mostly comprise solely of inhumation burials, with a distinct Kentish character. Conversely, in West Kent cemeteries such Orpington mix cremations with inhumations, which is more typical of Saxon cemeteries north of the River Thames.
This may suggest that West Kent at this point was independent of East Kent, and part of the Kingdom of the East Saxons north of the Thames Estuary.

===Development and westward expansion: 500–590===
In the sixth century the Kingdom of Kent had some relationship with the Merovingian-governed Kingdom of Francia, which was then extending its influence in northwestern Europe. Textual sources suggest that Kent may have been under Merovingian control for part of this century. Archeological evidence of Frankish material culture from this period has been found in Kent, but not in other areas of lowland Britain, suggesting a trade monopoly with the Frankish kingdom.

Sixth century Kentish artefacts have been found in continental Europe, in particular in the areas of modern Charente, western Normandy, the Rhineland, Frisia, Thuringia, and southern Scandinavia. They are relatively absent between the Sein and the Somme across the English Channel from the Saxons in Sussex, suggesting that trade was established between particular tribal or ethnic groups rather than by geography.
There is also archaeological evidence of Kentish trade links in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, and copies or imitations appearing in cemeteries further afield, in areas such as Wiltshire and Cambridgeshire.

Archaeological evidence suggests that at some point in the sixth century, East Kent annexed West Kent.
To the south lay the Weald, a dense forest of no value to the Kentish elite, leaving the fertile area west of the kingdom attractive for conquest, particularly the Darenth Valley and the dip slopes of the North Downs to the west of the Medway. During the sixth century, while the archaeological record in Kent includes items from Jutland, the dominant influence became Frankish.

===Established kingdom and Christianisation: 597–650===

Firmly in the control of an elite class, Kent is the first Anglo-Saxon kingdom to appear in the historical record in 597. The monk Bede refers to Kent as ruled by Æthelberht at this period, making him the earliest reliably attested Anglo-Saxon monarch. Bede states that Æthelberht was a &quot;bretwalda&quot; who controlled everything south of the River Humber, including other kingdoms.
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; refers to wars in sixth-century Britain, but most were in the west and did not affect Kent; the one exception was a battle between the Kentish and West Saxons in 568, during which Æthelberht&#x27;s forces were pushed back into Kent. Æthelberht&#x27;s reign also produced the Law of Æthelberht, the oldest surviving text in Old English.

According to Bede, the Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England began in Kent under Æthelberht&#x27;s reign when the Benedictine monk Augustine arrived on the Ebbsfleet peninsula in 597, bringing the Gregorian mission with him. Æthelberht&#x27;s Frankish wife, Bertha, was already a Christian, with Æthelberht himself converting a few years later. Æthelberht&#x27;s attempts to convert Rædwald demonstrate the links between the Kingdom of Kent and Kingdom of East Anglia, with shared North Sea interests.

During this period, Anglo-Saxon kings moved around their kingdoms continually, subsisting on goods from the local populations and reciprocating with gifts.
Various seventh and eighth century documents attest to the fact that Kent was governed by two kings, possibly a dominant one in the east and a subordinate in the west, perhaps reflecting the earlier divide. Trade with Francia was extensive in the seventh and eighth centuries and appears to have been under control of the kings of Kent, through the ports of Dover, Sarre and Fordwich.

This period witnessed the end of furnished burial, marked archaeologically by less regional distinctiveness of grave goods and more artefacts decorated in the Salin Style II motifs. It also saw the emergence of elite burials with far greater wealth than others; notable Kentish examples have been found at Sarre Anglo-Saxon cemetery and the Kingston Barrow cemetery, while the elite Taplow burial in modern Buckinghamshire also contained Kentish characteristics, suggesting a potential Kentish influence in that region.
==Middle and late Anglo-Saxon Kent==
===Decline and Mercian domination: 650–825===
In the seventh century, Kent&#x27;s power waned as that of Mercia and Northumbria grew, but it remained the fourth wealthiest kingdom in England, according to the &quot;Tribal Hidage&quot; with 15,000 hides of land recorded in the seventh or eighth century. However the period was tumultuous for the Kentish royal family; Kent was ruled by Ecgberht from 664 to 673, but between 664 and 667 two royal cousins, Æthelred and Æthelberht, were killed at Eastry royal hall, perhaps because they were a threat to Ecgberht. Ecgberht was succeeded by his brother, Hlothere, who ruled from 674 to 686 before being overthrown and killed by one of Ecgberht&#x27;s sons, Eadric, who had allied with the South Saxons; Eadric then ruled until 687.

In the late seventh century, Kent gradually came to be dominated by Mercia. There had been a Kentish royal hall and reeve in Lundenwic until at least the 680s, but the city then passed into Mercian hands. The loss of Lundenwic probably broke Kent&#x27;s monopoly on cross-Channel trade and its control of the Thames, eroding its economic influence. According to Bede&#x27;s later account, in 676 the Mercian king Æthelred I led an attack that destroyed many Kentish churches. Mercia&#x27;s control of Kent increased in the following decades; by 689–690 East Saxon kings under Mercian overlordship were active in West Kent, and there are records attesting that Æthelred arbitrated on the income of the Christian communities at Minster-in-Thanet and Reculver, indicating strong Mercian control over the east of the kingdom too.

In 686 Kent was conquered by Cædwalla of Wessex; within a year, Cædwalla&#x27;s brother Mul was killed in a Kentish revolt, and Cædwalla returned to devastate the kingdom again. After this, Kent fell into a state of disorder. The Mercians backed a client king named Oswine, but he seems to have reigned for only about two years, after which Wihtred became king. Wihtred, famous for the Law of Wihtred, did a great deal to restore the kingdom after the devastation and tumult of the preceding years, and in 694 he made peace with the West Saxons by paying compensation for the killing of Mul.

Records of Kent following the death of Wihtred in 725 are fragmented and obscure. For forty years, two or even three kings typically ruled simultaneously. This division may have made Kent the first target of the rising power of Offa of Mercia: in 764, he gained supremacy over Kent and ruled it through client kings. By the early 770s, it appears that Offa was attempting to rule Kent directly, and a rebellion followed. A battle was fought at Otford in 776, and although the outcome is unknown, records of following years suggest that the rebels prevailed; Egbert II and later Ealhmund seem to have ruled independently of Offa for nearly a decade thereafter. This did not last, however, as Offa firmly re-established his authority over Kent in 785.

Religious centres of this period, minsters containing a church, were often far larger than lay settlements, with access to many resources and trade links; the Minster-in-Thanet was recorded as possessing three trade ships.

The seventh century saw the reintroduction of masonry in Anglo-Saxon England, primarily for churches. The earliest churches in the region have been termed the &quot;Kentish Group&quot; and reflect both Italian and Frankish influences in their design; early examples include St Pancras, St Mary, and St Peter and St Paul, all part of St. Augustine&#x27;s monastery in Canterbury, as well as St. Andrews in Rochester and St Mary in Lyminge.

In the late seventh century, the earliest charters appear, giving estate boundaries, and showing reclamation of land, for use by livestock, from the Wantsum Channel and Romney Marsh. The Ebbsfleet watermill near Gravesend in West Kent, dated to circa 700, also reflects new uses of the landscape.

Canterbury grew into the economic and political centre of Kent during the seventh century, as evidenced by rubbish pits, metalworking, timber halls, and sunken-feature buildings from the period. Intensive development was also present at Dover, and possibly at Rochester, although archaeological evidence is lacking. It is known that both Canterbury and Rochester were the home to major mints in this period, primarily producing silver &quot;sceattas&quot;. This suggests that from the seventh century onward, kings in Kent were establishing control over the kingdom&#x27;s economic structure.

During the eighth and ninth centuries, a number of fortified earthworks, most notably Wansdyke and Offa&#x27;s Dyke, were constructed as barriers between the warring kingdoms; the Faestendic passing through the Cray Valley and the routeway that has since become the A25 were likely Kentish earthworks of this period designed to protect the kingdom. Evidence for such militarisation might also be seen in the Rochester Bridge burdens, documented from the 790s, which lay out the obligation for the Roman bridge across the River Medway to be maintained, which would be vital for allowing Kentish troops to cross the river.

After King Ealhmund presumably died shortly after witnessing a charter in 784, his son Egbert was driven out of Kent and into exile by Offa of Mercia. It is clear from charters that Offa was in control of Kent by 785. Rather than just acting as overlord of his new possession, he attempted to annex it or at least reduce its importance by creating a new diocese in Mercia at Lichfield, possibly because the archbishop of Canterbury Jænberht refused to crown his son Ecgfrith. Jænberht resigned a part of his bishopric and the pro-Mercian Hygeberht was chosen by King Offa to replace him &quot;through enmity conceived against the venerable Jænberht and the Kentish people&quot;, according to Offa&#x27;s eventual successor Coenwulf. In 796 Offa died, and in this moment of Mercian weakness a Kentish rebellion under Eadbert Praen temporarily succeeded. Offa&#x27;s eventual successor, Coenwulf, reconquered Kent in 798, however, and installed his brother Cuthred as king. After Cuthred&#x27;s death in 807, Coenwulf ruled Kent directly.

Mercian authority was replaced by that of Wessex in 825, following the latter&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Ellendun, and the Mercian client king Baldred was expelled.

===Viking attacks: 825–1066===
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that Kent was first attacked by Viking raiders in the late eighth century. Kent and southeast England would have been an attractive target because of its wealthy minsters, often located on exposed coastal locations. In 804, the nuns of Lyminge were granted refuge in Canterbury to escape the attackers, while in 811 Kentish forces gathered to repel a Viking army based on the Isle of Sheppey. Further recorded attacks occurred on Sheppey in 835, through Romney Marsh in 841, in Rochester in 842, Canterbury (Battle of Aclea) and Sandwich (Battle of Sandwich) in 851, Thanet in 853, and across Kent in 865. Kent was also attractive for its easy access to major land and sea routes. By 811, it is recorded that Vikings built fortifications on the Kentish north coast, and over-wintered their armies on Thanet in 851–852 and Sheppey in 854–855. At this point, Canterbury and Rochester still had Roman walls that could have been refurbished, but they were nevertheless attacked by the Vikings: Rochester in 842, Canterbury in 851, and Rochester again in 885, when they laid siege until it was liberated by Alfred&#x27;s army.
The &quot;Burghal Hidage&quot; lists the construction of the &quot;Eorpenburnam&quot; fort, possibly Castle Toll.
Hoards have been found, particularly around the West Kent coast, that might have been wealth hidden from the Vikings.

In 892, when southern England was united under Alfred the Great, Kent was on the brink of disaster. Alfred had defeated Guthrum the Old and allowed Vikings by treaty to settle in East Anglia and the North East. However, other Danes were still on the move. Haesten, a highly experienced warrior-leader, had mustered huge forces in northern France having besieged Paris and taken Brittany. As many as 350 Viking ships sailed from Boulogne to the south coast of Kent in 892. Between 5000 and 10,000 men, with their families and horses, came up Limen estuary (the east-west route of the Royal Military Canal in reclaimed Romney Marsh) and attacked a Saxon fort near St Rumwold&#x27;s church, Bonnington, killing all inside. They moved on and over the next year built a fortress at Appledore. Hearing of this, Danes in East Anglia and elsewhere then rose against Alfred. They raided Kent from Appledore, razing a large settlement, &quot;Seleberhtes Cert&quot; (present-day Great Chart near Ashford). They moved further inland and engaged in numerous battles with the English, but after four years they gave up. Some retreated to East Anglia and others fled to northern France and settled in Normandy.

A large Viking army led by Thorkell the Tall besieged Canterbury in 1011, culminating in the pillage of the city and the eventual murder of Archbishop Alphege, on 19 April 1012, despite Thorkell’s attempts to keep him alive to sell him for ransom.

<text>Simmering is a food preparation technique by which foods are cooked in hot liquids kept just below the boiling point of water (lower than ) and above poaching temperature (higher than ). To create a steady simmer, a liquid is brought to a boil, then its heat source is reduced to a lower, constant intensity (smaller flame on a gas stove, lower temperature on an induction/electric stove).

==Methods and equipments==
Simmering ensures gentler treatment than boiling to prevent food from toughening and/or breaking up. Simmering is usually a rapid and efficient method of cooking. Food that has simmered in milk or cream instead of water is sometimes referred to as creamed. The appropriate simmering temperature is a topic of debate among chefs, with some contending that a simmer is as low as .

Some modern gas ranges are equipped with a simmering burner, with such burners usually located at the rear of the range. Many electric ranges have a simmer setting.

Slow cookers are countertop electrical appliances used to simmer foods for hours at a time.

==By cuisine==
=== Japanese cuisine ===
In Japanese cuisine, simmering is often considered one of the four essential cooking techniques, along with grilling, steaming, and deep frying.

=== American cuisine ===
Food prepared in a crockpot is simmered. Examples include stews, chili, soups, etc.

=== Bulgarian cuisine ===
Bulgarian traditional food, especially tender meat dishes are often simmered for extended periods of time. Examples include stews, soups, Vanyas, etc.

=== Dutch and Flemish cuisine ===

In traditional Dutch and Flemish cuisine, less tender cuts of beef are simmered for several hours to obtain carbonade flamande. Traditionally a small flame is used, fed by burning oil. On modern stoves, the source of heat is put very low, or a simmering plate is used to diminish the heat. Usually a cast iron pan is used with a thick bottom. The meat is ready if it can be easily torn apart into threads.

=== Persian cuisine ===
Simmering is one of the most popular styles of cooking in Iran and Afghanistan. In traditional Persian cuisine, almost all types of Persian Khoresh are simmered for several hours. That is also the case with some other Iranian dishes like Abgoosht, Bozbash, etc.

=== Jewish cuisine ===
Simmering is the main cooking technique used in Shabbat stews because by Jewish law cooking is forbidden on Shabbat. Almost every Jewish diaspora group has had different versions of sabbath stews, with the common practice of boiling before Sabbath begins and then keeping the pot on a blech or other device to heat the food. Many Shabbat dishes are simmered overnight to conform to Jewish law, including &quot;cholent&quot; (Ashkenazi Jewish), &quot;hamin&quot; (Sepharadi Jewish) and &quot;t&#x27;bit&quot; (Iraqi Jewish).

<doc id="180894" wikidata="Q316536" url="?curid=180894" title="Tristan Corbière">
<text>Tristan Corbière (18 July 1845 – 1 March 1875), born Édouard-Joachim Corbière, was a French poet born in Coat-Congar, Ploujean (now part of Morlaix) in Brittany, where he lived most of his life before dying of tuberculosis at the age of 29. He was a French poet, close to Symbolism, and a figure of the &quot;cursed poet&quot;. 

He is the author of a single collection of poetry &quot;Les Amours Jaunes&quot;, and of a few prose pieces. He led a mostly marginal and miserable life, nourished by two major failures due to his bone disease and his &quot;ugliness&quot; which he enjoyed accusing: the first is his sentimental life (he only loved one woman, called &quot;Marcelle&quot; in his work), and the second being his passion for the sea (he dreamt of becoming a sailor, like his father, Édouard Corbière). His poetry carries these two great wounds which led him to adopt a very cynical and incisive style, towards himself as much towards the life and world around him.

He died at the age of 29, possibly from tuberculosis, a childless bachelor with no work, entrenched in his old Breton manor, misunderstood by his contemporaries, and his innovative poetry was not recognised until well after his death.

==Family and schooling==
His mother Marie-Angélique-Aspasie Puyo, 19 years old at the time of his birth, belonged to one of the most prominent families of the local bourgeoisie. His father was Antoine-Édouard Corbière, known for his best-selling novel &quot;Le Négrier&quot;. A cousin, Constant Puyo, was a well-known Pictorialist photographer.

During his schooling at the Imperial Lycée of Saint-Brieuc where he studied from 1858 until 1860, he fell prey to a deep depression, and, over several freezing winters, contracted the severe rheumatism which was to disfigure him. He blamed his parents for having placed him there, far from his family&#x27;s care and affection. Difficulties in adapting to the harsh discipline of the college&#x27;s &quot;noble débris&quot; (distinguished relics, i.e., teachers) gradually developed those characteristics of anarchic disdain and sarcasm which were to give much of his verse their distinctive voice.

==Poetry==
Corbière&#x27;s only published verse in his lifetime appeared in &quot;Les amours jaunes&quot;, 1873, a volume that went almost unnoticed until Paul Verlaine included him in his gallery of &quot;poètes maudits&quot; (accursed poets). Thereafter Verlaine&#x27;s recommendation was enough to establish him as one of the masters acknowledged by the Symbolists, and he was subsequently rediscovered and treated as a predecessor by the surrealists.

Close-packed, linked to the ocean and his Breton roots, and tinged with disdain for Romantic sentimentalism, his work is also characterised by its idiomatic play and exceptional modernity. He was praised by both Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot (whose work he had a great influence on).

Eliot used his self-description as &quot;Mélange adultère de tout&quot; as the title for one of his own (French) poems. Many subsequent modernist poets have also studied him, and he has often been translated into English. 

His complete poems appear in two volumes with translations by the English poet Christopher Pilling.

A very precise commented version of Les Amours jaunes was published in 1993 by Elisabeth Aragon and Claude Bonnin for the Presses universitaires de l&#x27;université de Toulouse-Le Mirail. It is now on open and free access: https://new-pum.univ-tlse2.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Les_amours_jaunes.pdf

<text>Hārītī (Sanskrit), also known as , , is revered as a fierce Dharma Protector in the Vajrayana tradition of Nepalese Buddhism, and revered both as a goddess and demon in other Mahayana Buddhist traditions where she is one of the Twenty-Four Protective Deities. 

In the Mahayana tradition, her positive aspects are regarded for the protection of children, easy delivery and happy child rearing, while her negative aspects include the belief of her terror towards irresponsible parents and unruly children.

In both Chinese and Japanese Buddhism, she is venerated as a protector deity, but in many folk traditions is often recognized as a female demon of misery and unhappiness towards children and parents.

==Narrative==

According to a Thai-Burmese Thervada oral story popular in southeast asia, Abhiriti or Hariti was a yakshini born in Buddhasasana of Buddha Vesabhu. She is considered to be daughter of Mother Dhamma. Once in city of human realm, a helpless Yaksha infant was hungry and crying. None of humans was willing to get him stop because his brutal appearance. The innocent prayed to Mother Dharma. Mother Dharma looked at him with infinite compassion or mercy. From that compassion, Hariti was born. She came to the realm of earth and lactating to the hungry demon infant. When he is satisfied and stopped crying, she went to realm of Yaksha and gave the child to his guardians. The king of Yakshas was very impressed with her. He proposed her for marriage and becoming mother of all asuras/demons. She agreed with the permission of Mother Dharma. There are hundreds of stories about Hariti and her dedication to her devotee and respon for prayers. Once upon time, earth realm experienced extreme drought, lacking crops and water. Human realm was in huge chaos, in that circumstances, buddhist monks advised them to pray Hariti to help them, human n non humans started praying Kubera and Hariti. Out of mercy, Hariti with help of divine powers, rain was happened, greenery was returned and blessed the earth realm with prosperity. She created a divine jar which provide infinite Siri/Prosperity to the human realm. 

Yakshas are usually live more than humans even for many kalpas. Hariti is considered as the possessor of mysterious wealth of the earth. She was steadfast in ethics, mindfulness, and wisdom. Her husband was the king of yaksha, the kubera. She had no children. Once she was dwelling in the city of rajgir where Buddha Shakyamuni was staying. In search of experience of motherhood, she started bringing unhappy human babies in her abode from Rajgir city where the Buddha Shakyamuni was staying. Consequently, victim mothers from Rajgir pleaded to the Buddha. Buddha went to the abode of Hariti and brought one of her kidnapped beloved children with him in his vihara. Hariti was devastated when she found out. After futilely searching for that little, she finally appealed to the Buddha. The Buddha revealed how she was suffering in the absence of one child, similarly, many of other mothers and families were still suffering from the loss of their beloved children. Hariti acknowledged that their suffering is bigger than her. She returned all the kidnapped babies to their mothers and again became steadfast in the Dhamma. Buddha taught her Dhamma rituals associated with upbringing of a child. Hariti started practicing universal metta and karuna to all beings. Hariti declared that she is no longer a woman with no children, she is now the mother of all beings. Hariti promised the Buddha that she would protect and love children of all realms. She practices and teaches the four Brahma viharas to all worldly beings, for benefits of her children. Buddha hailed her as the Jagatmata or the mother of all realms. In Theravada, she is the supreme mother of all humans as well as non humans who hari(eliminates or destroys)(-ti) obstacles from their life. 

According to another Mahayana myth, Hārītī was originally a rākṣasī of Rajgir at the same time that Gautama Buddha also lived there. She had hundreds of children of her own, whom she loved and doted upon, but to feed them, she abducted and killed the children of others. The bereaved mothers of her victims pleaded to the Buddha to save them. So, the Buddha stole the youngest of her sons, Piṅgala (in a variant version, the youngest daughter), and hid him under his rice bowl. After having desperately searched for her missing son throughout the universe, Hārītī finally appealed to the Buddha for help. 

The Buddha pointed out that she was suffering because she lost one of hundreds of children, and asked if she could imagine the suffering of parents whose only child had been devoured. She replied contritely that their suffering must be many times greater than hers. She then vowed to protect all children, and in lieu of children&#x27;s flesh, she would henceforth only eat pomegranates. Henceforth Hārītī became the protector of children and women in childbirth. In exchange, the Buddha gave her bodhi, which enabled her to withstand black magic and evil powers, and gave her the facility to cure the sick.

In the Japanese version of the tale, Kishimojin enlisted the aid of the to abduct and murder the children of other families. In some variants of the myth, the Ten Rākṣasī Women are themselves daughters (or daughters&#x27; daughters) of Kishimojin. When Kishimojin accepted the Buddha&#x27;s teachings, the Ten Demon Daughters did likewise.

In Chinese Buddhism, Hārītī is also known as Hēlìdì (訶利帝) or Hēlìdìmǔ (訶梨帝母). In Chinese tradition, she is one of the Twenty-Four Protective Devas (二十四諸天 Èrshísì zhūtiān), a group of Dharmapalas who are venerated as protectors of Buddhists and the Dharma. Statues of this group (and Hārītī) are often enshrined within the Mahavira Hall in Chinese temples and monasteries.
Hārītī is a figure of the 26th chapter of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, and is especially important to Nichiren Buddhism. In Shingon Buddhism, she is named or . Her iconography is based mostly on the .

In Japanese tradition, Kishimojin is an aspect of Kannon, the goddess of mercy, and she bears the epithets and .

==Iconography==

The iconography of Hārītī shows similarities to the Greek goddess Tyche and may have been transmitted to East Asia through the influence of Greco-Buddhism. In Greek art, Tyche was depicted in the presence of children, carrying a cornucopia (horn of plenty), an emblematic gubernaculum (ship&#x27;s rudder), and the wheel of fortune; she may stand on the wheel, presiding over the entire circle of fate.

<text>James Lafayette Dickey (February 2, 1923 January 19, 1997) was an American poet and novelist. He was appointed the eighteenth United States Poet Laureate in 1966. He also received the Order of the South award.

Dickey is best known for his novel &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1970), which was adapted into the acclaimed 1972 film of the same name.

==Early years==
Dickey was born to lawyer Eugene Dickey and Maibelle Swift in Atlanta, Georgia, where he attended North Fulton High School in Atlanta&#x27;s Buckhead neighborhood. After graduation from North Fulton High in 1941, Dickey completed a postgraduate year at Darlington School in Rome, Georgia. Dickey asked to be dismissed from the Darlington rolls in a 1941 letter to the principal, deeming the school the most &quot;disgusting combination of cant, hypocrisy, cruelty, class privilege and inanity I have ever since encountered at any human institution.&quot; In 1942, he enrolled at Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina and played on the football team as a tailback. After one semester, he left school to enlist in the military. During World War II, Dickey served with the U.S. Army Air Forces, where he flew thirty-eight missions in the PacificTheater as a P-61 Black Widow radar operator with the 418th Night Fighter Squadron, an experience that influenced his work, and for which he was awarded five Bronze Stars. He later served in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War. Between the wars, he attended Vanderbilt University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a degree in English and philosophy (as well as minoring in astronomy) in 1949. He also received an M.A. in English from Vanderbilt in 1950.

==Career==
Dickey taught as an instructor of English at Rice University (then Rice Institute) in Houston, Texas in 1950 and following his second Air Force stint, from 1952 to 1954, Dickey returned to academic teaching. Dickey then quit his teaching job at the University of Florida in the spring of 1956 after a group of the American Pen&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Society protested his reading of the poem called &quot;The Father&#x27;s Body&quot;; he quit rather than apologize. This incident some critics believe he manipulated to his advantage, he became a successful copy writer for advertising agencies selling Coca-Cola and Lay&#x27;s potato chips while in his free time writing some of his best poetry. He once said he embarked on his advertising career in order to &quot;make some bucks.&quot; Dickey also said &quot;I was selling my soul to the devil all day... and trying to buy it back at night.&quot; He was ultimately fired for shirking his work responsibilities.

His first book, &quot;Into the Stone and Other Poems&quot;, was published in 1960. &quot;Drowning with Others&quot; was published in 1962, which led to a Guggenheim Fellowship (Norton Anthology, The Literature of the American South). &quot;Buckdancer&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1965) earned him a National Book Award for Poetry.
Among his better-known poems are &quot;The Performance&quot;, &quot;Cherrylog Road&quot;, &quot;The Firebombing&quot;, &quot;May Day Sermon&quot;, &quot;Falling&quot;, and &quot;For The Last Wolverine&quot;.

He published his first volume of collected poems, &quot;Poems 1957-1967&quot; in 1967 after being named a poetry consultant for the Library of Congress. This publication represents Dickey&#x27;s best-known poetry. After serving as a visiting lecturer at several institutions from 1963 to 1968 (including Reed College, California State University, Northridge, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Washington University in St. Louis and the Georgia Institute of Technology), Dickey returned to academia in earnest in 1969 as a professor of English and writer-in-residence at the University of South Carolina, a position he held for the remainder of his life. It was there that he was also inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa, the National Leadership Honor Society, in 1970.

Dickey wrote the poem &quot;The Moon Ground&quot; for &quot;Life&quot; magazine in celebration of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. His reading of it was broadcast on ABC television on July 20, 1969.

His popularity exploded after the film version of his novel &quot;Deliverance&quot; was released in 1972. Dickey wrote the screenplay and had a cameo in the film as a sheriff.

On January 20, 1977, Dickey was invited to read his poem &quot;The Strength of Fields&quot; at the inauguration of Jimmy Carter.

==Personal life==
In November 1948 Dickey married Maxine Syerson, and three years later they had their first son, Christopher; a second son, Kevin, was born in 1958.

Christopher Dickey was a novelist and journalist, providing coverage from the Middle East for &quot;Newsweek&quot;. In 1998, Christopher wrote a book about his father and Christopher&#x27;s own sometimes troubled relationship with him, titled &quot;Summer of Deliverance&quot;. Christopher died in July 2020.

Kevin Dickey is an interventional radiologist and lives in Winston-Salem, NC.

Two months after Maxine died in 1976, Dickey married one of his students, Deborah Dodson. Their daughter, Bronwen, was born in 1981. Bronwen is an author, journalist, and lecturer. Her first book, &quot;Pit Bull: The Battle over an American Icon&quot;, was published in 2016.

===Death===
Dickey died on January 19, 1997, aged 73, six days after his last class at the University of South Carolina, where from 1968 he taught as poet in residence.

<doc id="180906" wikidata="Q25649" url="?curid=180906" title="Saul Alinsky">
<text>Saul David Alinsky (January 30, 1909 – June 12, 1972) was an American community activist and political theorist. His work through the Chicago-based Industrial Areas Foundation helping poor communities organize to press demands upon landlords, politicians, bankers and business leaders won him national recognition and notoriety. Responding to the impatience of a New Left generation of activists in the 1960s, Alinsky – in his widely cited &quot;Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer&quot; (1971) – defended the arts both of confrontation and of compromise involved in community organizing as keys to the struggle for social justice. 

Beginning in the 1990s, Alinsky&#x27;s reputation was revived by commentators on the political right as a source of tactical inspiration for the Republican Tea Party movement and subsequently, by virtue of indirect associations with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, as the alleged source of a radical Democratic political agenda. While criticized on the political left for an aversion to broad ideological goals, Alinsky has also been identified as an inspiration for the Occupy movement and campaigns for climate action.

== Early life ==
===Childhood===
Saul Alinsky was born in 1909 in Chicago, Illinois, to Lithuanian Jewish emigrant parents from Vilnius, Russian Empire. He was the only surviving son of Benjamin Alinsky and his second wife, Sarah Tannenbaum Alinsky, from Vilnius (now Lithuania). His father started out as a tailor, then ran a delicatessen and a cleaning shop.

Both parents were strict and observant Orthodox. Alinsky describes himself as being devout until the age of 12, the point at which he began to fear his parents would force him to become a rabbi. Although he had &quot;not personally&quot; encountered &quot;much antisemitism as a child&quot;, Alinsky recalled that &quot;it was so pervasive ... you just accepted it as a fact of life.&quot; Called up for retaliating against some Polish boys, Alinsky acknowledged one rabbinical lesson that &quot;sank home.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s the American way . . . Old Testament . . . They beat us up, so we beat the hell out of them. That&#x27;s what everybody does.&quot; The rabbi looked at him for a moment and said quietly, &quot;You think you&#x27;re a man because you do what everybody does. But I want to tell you something great: &#x27;where there are no men, be thou a man&#x27;&quot;. Alinsky considered himself an agnostic, but when asked about his religion would &quot;always say Jewish.&quot;

===College studies===
In 1926, Alinsky entered the University of Chicago. He studied in America&#x27;s first sociology department under Ernest Burgess and Robert E. Park. Overturning the propositions of a still ascendant eugenics movement, Burgess and Park argued that social disorganization, not heredity, was the cause of disease, crime, and other characteristics of slum life. As the passage of successive waves of immigrants through such districts had demonstrated, it is the slum area itself, and not the particular group living there, with which social pathologies were associated. Yet Alinsky claimed to be &quot;astounded by all the horse manure [sociologists] were handing out about poverty and slums, playing down the suffering and deprivation, glossing over the misery and despair. I mean, Christ, I’d lived in a slum, I could see through all their complacent academic jargon to the realities.&quot;

The Great Depression put an end to an interest in archaeology: after the stock-market crash &quot;all the guys who funded the field trips were being scraped off Wall Street sidewalks.&quot; A chance graduate fellowship moved Alinsky on to criminology. For two years, as a &quot;nonparticipant observer&quot;, he claims to have hung out with Chicago&#x27;s Al Capone mob (he explains that, as they &quot;owned the city&quot;, they felt they had little to hide from a &quot;college kid&quot;). Among other things about the exercise of power, he says they taught him was &quot;the terrific importance of personal relationships&quot;. Alinsky took a job in the Illinois, Division of the State Criminologist, working with juvenile delinquents and at the Joliet Correctional Center. He recalls it as a dispiriting experience: if he dwelt on the contributing causes of crime, such as poor housing, racial discrimination, or unemployment, he was labelled a &quot;red.&quot;

==Organizing==
===The Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council===
In 1938, Alinsky gave up his last employment at the Institute for Juvenile Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, to devote himself full-time as a political activist. In his free time he had been raising funds for the International Brigade (organized by the Communist International) in the Spanish Civil War and for southern sharecroppers, organizing for the Newspaper Guild and other fledgling unions, fighting evictions, and agitating for public housing. He also began to work alongside the CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations) and its president John L. Lewis. (In an &quot;un-authorized biography&quot; of the labor leader Alinsky wrote that he later mediated between Lewis and President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the White House).

Alinsky&#x27;s idea was to apply the organizing skills he believed he had mastered &quot;to the worst slums and ghettos, so that the most oppressed and exploited elements could take control of their own communities and their own destinies. Up until then, specific factories and industries had been organized for social change, but never whole communities.&quot;

In the belief that if he could trial his approach in these neighborhoods, he could do so successfully anywhere, Alinsky looked to the back of the Chicago Stockyards (the area made infamous by Upton Sinclair&#x27;s 1905 novel &quot;The Jungle&quot;). There with Joseph Meegan, a park supervisor, Alinsky set up the Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council (BYNC). Working with the archdiocese, the Council succeeded in rallying a mix of otherwise mutually hostile Catholic ethnics (Irish, Poles, Lithuanians, Mexicans, Croats . . .) as well as African Americans to demand, and win, concessions from local meatpackers (in January 1946 the BYNC threw its support behind the first major walkout of the United Packinghouse Workers), landlords and city hall. This, and other efforts in the city&#x27;s South Side to &quot;turn scattered, voiceless discontent into a united protest&quot; earned an accolade from Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson: Alinsky&#x27;s aims &quot;most faithfully reflect our ideals of brotherhood, tolerance, charity and dignity of the individual.&quot;

In founding the BYNC, Alinsky and Meegan sought to break a pattern of outside direction established by their predecessors in poor urban areas, most notably the settlement houses. The BYNC would be based on local democracy: &quot;organizers would facilitate, but local people had to lead and participate.&quot; Residents had to &quot;control their own destiny&quot; and in doing so not only gain new resources but new confidence as well. &quot;Some of Saul&#x27;s real genius,&quot; according to one observer, was &quot;his sense of timing and understanding how others would perceive something. Saul knew that if I grab you by the shoulders and say do this, do that and the other, you&#x27;re going to resent it. If you make the discovery yourself, you&#x27;re going to strut because you made it&quot;.

===The Industrial Areas Foundation===

In 1940, with the support of Roman Catholic Bishop Bernard James Sheil and Chicago Sun-Times publisher and department-store owner Marshall Field, Alinsky founded the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF), a national community organizing network. The mandate was to partner with religious congregations and civic organizations to build &quot;broad-based organizations&quot; that could train up local leadership and promote trust across community divides. For Alinsky there was also a broader mission.

In what sixty years later, with publication of Robert Putnam&#x27;s &quot;Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community&quot;, would have been understood as a concern for the loss of &quot;social capital&quot; (of the organized opportunities for conviviality and deliberation that allow and encourage ordinary people to engage in democratic process), in his own statement of purpose for the IAF, Alinsky wrote:
In our modern urban civilization, multitudes of our people have been condemned to urban anonymity—to living the kind of life where many of them neither know nor care for their neighbors. This course of urban anonymity...is one of eroding destruction to the foundations of democracy. For although we profess that we are citizens of a democracy, and although we may vote once every four years, millions of our people feel deep down in their heart of hearts that there is no place for them—that they do not &#x27;count&#x27;.

Through the IAF, Alinsky spent the next 10 years repeating his organizational work--&quot;rubbing raw&quot;, as the &quot;New York Times&quot; saw it &quot;the sores of discontent&quot; and compelling action through agitation--&quot;from Kansas City and Detroit to the farm-worker barrios of Southern California.&quot; Although Alinsky always had rationalizations, his biographer Sanford Horwitt records that &quot;on rare occasions&quot; Alinsky would concede that not all of his mentored projects were &quot;unequivocal successes&quot;. There was uncertainty about &quot;what was supposed to happen after the first two or three years, when the original organizer and/or fund-raiser left the community council on its own.&quot; Recognizing that the IAF could not be &quot;a holding for People&#x27;s Organizations&quot;, Alinsky thought that one solution would be for community-councils, under their native leadership, to constitute their own inter-city fund-raising and mutual-assistance network. In the early 1950s, Alinsky was talking about &quot;a million-dollar budget to carry us over a three-year plan of organization through the country.&quot; The usual corporate and foundation funders proved decidedly cold to the idea.

Successes could also be problematic. In Chicago, the Back of the Yards Council set itself against housing integration and offered no objection to a pattern of &quot;urban renewal&quot; with which Alinsky professed himself &quot;fed-up&quot;: &quot;the moving of low-income and, almost without exception, Negro groups and dumping them into other slums,&quot; in order to build houses for middle-income whites. There being &quot;no substitute for organized power,&quot; Alinsky concluded in 1959 that what the city needed was a powerful black community organization that could &quot;bargain collectively&quot; with other organized groups and agencies, private and public.

===Mentoring in The Woodlawn Organization===
With the groundwork prepared by his deputy Edward T. Chambers, Alinsky began mentoring The Woodlawn Organization (TWO), based in the Woodlawn community area on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. Like other IAF organizations, TWO was a coalition of existing community entities, local block clubs, churches, and businesses. These groups paid dues, and the organization was run by an elected board. The TWO moved quickly to establish itself as the &quot;voice&quot; of the black neighborhood, mobilizing, developing and bringing up new leadership. An example was Arthur M. Brazier, the first spokesperson and eventual president of the organization. Starting out as a mail carrier, Brazier became a preacher in a store front church, and then, through TWO, emerged as a national spokesman for the Black Power movement.

In 1961, to show city hall that TWO was a force to be reckoned with, Alinsky combined &quot;two elements—votes, which were the coin of the realm in Chicago politics, and fear of the black mass&quot; by bussing 2,500 black resident citizens, down to city hall to register to vote.

Through TWO, Woodlawn residents challenged the redevelopment plans of the University of Chicago. Alinsky claimed the organization was the first community group not only to plan its own urban renewal but, even more important, to control the letting of contracts to building contractors. Alinsky found it &quot;touching to see how competing contractors suddenly discovered the principles of brotherhood and racial equality.&quot; Similar &quot;conversions&quot; were secured from employers elsewhere in the city with mass shop-ins at department stores, tying up bank lines with people exchanging pennies for bills and vice versa, and the threat of a &quot;piss-in&quot; at Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport.

For Alinsky the &quot;essence of successful tactics&quot; was &quot;originality.&quot; When Mayor Daley dragged his heels on building violations and health procedures, TWO threatened to unload a thousand live rats on the steps of city hall: &quot;sort of share-the-rats program, a form of integration&quot;: 
Any tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag itself. No matter how burning the injustice and how militant your supporters, people get turned off by repetitious and conventional tactics. Your opposition also learns what to expect and how to neutralize you unless you&#x27;re constantly devising new strategies.
Alinsky said that he &quot;knew the day of sit-ins had ended&quot; when the executive of a military contractor showed him blueprints for the new corporate headquarters. &quot;&#x27;And here&#x27;, the executive said, &#x27;is our sit-in-hall. [You will have] plenty of comfortable chairs, two coffee machines and lots of magazines . . . &#x27;&quot;. &quot;You are not going to get anywhere&quot;, Alinsky concluded, unless you are &quot;constantly inventing new and better tactics&quot; that move beyond your opponent&#x27;s expectations.

===FIGHT, Rochester, NY===
In the 1960s, Alinsky focused through the IAF on the training of community organizers. The IAF assisted Black community organizing groups in Kansas City and Buffalo, and the Community Service Organization of Mexican Americans in California, training, among others, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. 

In July 1964, a race riot broke out in Rochester, New York, which Alinsky said was owned &quot;lock stock and barrel&quot; by Eastman Kodak, whose only contribution to race relations was &quot;the invention of color film&quot;. In the wake of the riots, the Rochester area churches, together with black civil rights leaders, invited Alinsky and the IAF to help the community organize. With the Reverend Franklin Florence, who had been close to Malcolm X, they established FIGHT (Freedom, Integration, God, Honor, Today).

Concluding that picketing and boycotts would not work, FIGHT began to think of some &quot;far-out tactics along the lines of our O&#x27;Hare shit in.&quot; This included a &quot;fart-in&quot; at the Rochester Philharmonic, Kodak&#x27;s &quot;cultural jewel.&quot; It was a proposal Alinsky considered &quot;absurd rather than juvenile. But isn&#x27;t much of life kind of a theater of the absurd?&quot; No tactic that might work was &quot;frivolous.&quot; Following a disruption of its annual stockholders&#x27; convention in April 1967 assisted by Unitarians and others assigning FIGHT their proxy votes (Alinsky had called on them to &quot;put your stock where your sermons are&quot;), Kodak recognized FIGHT as a broad-based community organization and committed, through a recruitment and training program, to black employment, in June 1967. A retired public affairs officer for Kodak later said, &quot;Alinsky and the people who exploited the situation were looking for attention,&quot; and claimed Kodak had already undertaken or was developing a lot of the programs that community activists sought. &quot;We were working on it.&quot;

===Community action in the federal War on Poverty===
While in Rochester, Alinsky had been employed four-days a month at the federally-funded Community Action Training Center at Syracuse University. The 1964 Economic Opportunity Act, passed as a part of Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty, committed the federal government to promoting the &quot;maximum feasible participation&quot; of targeted communities in the design and delivery of anti-poverty programs.

This appeared to acknowledge what Alinsky insisted was the key to social and economic deprivation, &quot;political poverty&quot;:Poverty means not only lacking money, but also lacking power. ... When ... poverty and the lack of power bar you from equal protection, equal equity in the courts, and equal participation in the economic and social life of your society, then you are poor. ... [An] anti-poverty program must recognise that its program has to do something about not only economic poverty but also political poverty Alinsky was sceptical of Community Action Program (CAP) funding under the Act doing more than provide relief for the &quot;welfare industry&quot;: &quot;the use of poverty funds to absorb staff salaries and operating costs by changing the title of programs and putting a new poverty label here and there is an old device&quot;. If it was to achieve more than this, there had to be meaningful representation of the poor &quot;through their own organised power&quot;.

In practice this would mean that the federal sponsor for community action, the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), should bypass city halls and either fund existing militant organisations such as FIGHT in Rochester (although these could never allow the federal government to be their core funder) or, in communities not already organized, seek out local leadership to initiate the process of building a resident organization. Amendments to OEO funding in the summer of 1965 ruled out any such &quot;creative federalism&quot;. These gave city halls the right to select the official Community Action Agency (CAA) for their community and reserved two-thirds of the CAA boards for business representative and elected officials. There was no prospect of a federal mandate favoring Alinsky&#x27;s organizing model.

The one-year OEO grant for the program at Syracuse that had hired Alinsky was not renewed. When the program trainees began organizing residents against city agencies, the mayor withdrew cooperation.

==Political contentions==
===Communism===
Alinsky never became a direct target of McCarthyism. He was never called before a congressional investigating committee nor had to endure a determined press campaign to identify and exclude him as a communist &quot;fellow traveler&quot;. Alinsky liked to think this because of his toughness and the ridicule he would have heaped upon his persecutors. Herb March, the most prominent Communist Party USA member with the Packinghouse Workers in Chicago, said he would &quot;place a little more emphasis ... on the Church influence&quot;, but also allowed that, as the government &quot;undoubtedly must have had him under close surveillance&quot;, they cannot have had &quot;anything&quot; on him.

Yet Alinsky was not &quot;untouched by the climate of fear, suspicion and innuendo&quot;. Rumors of communist associations and red-baiting would follow him into the 1960s, and, once his name was associated with leading Democratic Party presidential contenders, would follow his legacy into the new century. For some of his &quot;anti-communist&quot; critics, Alinsky&#x27;s definition in &quot;Reveille for Radicals&quot; of what it is to be a &quot;radical&quot; may have been a sufficient indictment:The Radical believes that all peoples should have a high standard of food, housing, and health … The Radical places human rights far above property rights. He is for universal, free public education and recognizes this as fundamental to the democratic way of life … The Radical believes completely in real equality of opportunity for all peoples regardless of race, color, or creed. He insists on full employment for economic security but is just as insistent that man&#x27;s work should not only provide economic security but also be such as to satisfy the creative desires within all men.

Alinsky would not apologize for working with communists at a time when, in his opinion, they were doing &quot;a hell of a lot of good work in the vanguard of the labor movement and ... in aiding blacks and Okies and Southern sharecroppers.&quot; He also said, &quot;Anyone who was involved in the causes of the thirties and says he didn&#x27;t know any communists is either a liar or an idiot&quot;. They were &quot;all over the place, fighting for the New Deal the CIO and so forth&quot;.

Alinsky said he was &quot;sympathetic to Russia at that time [i.e. in the 1930s before the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact] because it was the one country that seemed to be taking a strong position against Hitler... If you were anti-fascist on the international front in those days you had to stand with Communists&quot;. But Alinsky insists he &quot;never joined the party&quot; for reasons &quot;partly philosophic&quot;:One of my articles of faith is what Justice Learned Hand called &quot;that ever-gnawing inner doubt as to whether you are right.&quot; I&#x27;ve never been sure
I&#x27;m right but also I&#x27;m also sure nobody else has this thing called truth. I hate dogma. People who believed they owned the truth have been responsible for the most terrible things that have happened in our world, whether they were Communist purges or the Spanish Inquisition or the Salem witch hunts.

In &quot;Reveille&quot;, Alinsky is &quot;as contemptuous of &#x27;top down&#x27; centralizing Soviet approaches to social planning as he is of laissez-faire economic policies&quot;. The Radical, he says, &quot;will bitterly oppose complete Federal control of education. He will fight for individual rights and against centralized power …The Radical is deeply interested in social planning but just as deeply suspicious of and antagonistic to any idea of plans which work from the top down. Democracy to him is working from the bottom up&quot;. With Thomas Jefferson, the Radical believes that the people are &quot;the most honest and safe&quot;, if not always the wisest, &quot;depository of the public interest.&quot;

On the issue of whether communists should be banned from unions and other social organizations, Alinsky argued that:[The question is] whether there can be developed an American Progressive Movement in which the Communists are forced to follow along or get out on the basis of the issues--a movement so healthy, so filled with the vitality of real American Radicalism, that the Communists will wear their teeth down to their jaws trying to bore from within. I know that the latter can be done But in the meantime, Alinsky believed that &quot;certain fascist mentalities&quot; posed a far greater threat to the country than &quot;the damn nuisance of Communism&quot;.

===The Black Power movement===
In the mid-1960s, civil rights activists began to call for &quot;Black Power&quot;—for Stokely Carmichael a &quot;call for black people to define their own goals, to lead their own organizations&quot;. Alinsky appeared not to be fazed. &quot;I agree with the concept,&quot; he said in the fall of 1966. &quot;We&#x27;ve always called it community power, and if the community is black, it&#x27;s black power.&quot; But a year later he was relating, with evident satisfaction, that when he had asked Carmichael at a Detroit meeting to cite one concrete example of what he meant by Black Power, Carmichael had named the FIGHT project in Rochester. Carmichael, Alinsky suggested, should stop &quot;going round yelling &#x27;Black Power!&#x27;&quot; and &quot;really go down and organize.&quot;

Alinsky had a sharper response to the more strident black nationalism of Maulana Karenga, mistakenly identified in news reports as a board member of the newly formed Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization. In an angry letter to the Foundation&#x27;s executive director, Lucius Walker, Alinsky took exception to one of Karenga&#x27;s &quot;insights,&quot; that &quot;blacks are a country and if you support America you are against my community.&quot; This Alinsky found &quot;repugnant and nauseous.&quot; He and his associates would not only &quot;plead guilty to supporting America&quot; but would &quot;gladly admit that we love our country.&quot; Horwitt notes that in 1968 &quot;virtually no leftist dissenter – black or white – was using this kind of patriotic rhetoric.&quot;

By 1970, Alinsky had conceded publicly that &quot;all whites should get out of the black ghettos. It&#x27;s a stage we have to go through.&quot;

===The Student New Left===
At the beginning of the 1960s, in the first postwar generation of college youth, Alinsky appeared to win new allies. Disclaiming any &quot;formulas&quot; or &quot;closed theories,&quot; Students for a Democratic Society called for a &quot;new left ... committed to deliberativeness, honesty [and] reflection.&quot; More than this, the New Left seemed to place community organizing at the heart of their vision.

The SDS insisted that students &quot;look outwards&quot; beyond the campus &quot;to the less exotic but more lasting struggles for justice.&quot; &quot;The bridge to political power&quot; would be &quot;built through genuine cooperation, locally, nationally, and internationally, between a new left of young people and an awakening community of allies.&quot; To stimulate &quot;this kind of social movement, this kind of vision and program in campus and community across the country,&quot; in 1963, the SDS launched (with $5000 from United Automobile Workers) the Economic Research and Action Project (ERAP). SDS community organizers would help draw white neighborhoods into an &quot;interracial movement of the poor&quot;. By the end of 1964, ERAP had ten inner-city projects engaging 125 student volunteers.

In the summer of 1964, Ralph Helstein of the Packinghouse Workers, one of the few labor leaders interested in the emergence of the New Left, arranged for Alinsky to meet SDS founders Tom Hayden and Todd Gitlin. To Helstein&#x27;s dismay Alinsky dismissed Hayden and Gitlin&#x27;s ideas and work as naive and doomed to failure. The would-be organizers were absurdly romantic in their view of the poor and of what could be achieved by consensus. Horwitt notes that &quot;&#x27;Participatory democracy,&#x27; the central concept the SDS&#x27;s Port Huron Statement, meant something fundamentally different . . . to what &#x27;citizen participation&#x27; meant to Alinsky.&quot; Within community organizations Alinsky &quot;put a premium on strong leadership, structure and centralized decision-making.&quot; 

When SDS volunteers set up shop in the &quot;Hillbilly Harlem&quot; of uptown Chicago, they crossed town to meet with Alinsky in Woodlawn. They charged Alinsky with being &quot;stuck in the past,&quot; and unwilling to confront white racism. To meet the challenge of growing black dissent following the August 1965 Watts riots, King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) had sought a victory in the North with the Chicago Freedom Movement (CFM). JOIN later claimed that they pushed whites on the race question &quot;at every opportunity&quot; and &quot;even mobilized members to support Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s campaign to desegregate housing in Chicago in the summer of 1966&quot;.

It is not clear that participation by Alinsky in the Chicago Freedom Movement was either offered or invited. Yet &quot;Freedom Summer&quot; in 1965 seemed to follow the Alinsky playbook: &quot;The job of the organizer is to maneuver and bait the establishment so that it will publicly attack him as a &#x27;dangerous enemy&#x27;. The hysterical instant reaction of the establishment [will] not only validate [the organizer&#x27;s] credentials of competency but also ensure automatic popular invitation&quot;. The difficulty was that Daley&#x27;s experience was such that that city hall could not be drawn into a sufficiently damaging confrontation. The mayor responded to the brutal reception for Freedom marchers in the white neighborhoods of Gage Park and Marquette Park with a judicious expression of sympathy and support. King balked at a further escalation—a march through the red-lined suburb of Cicero, &quot;the Selma of the North&quot;—and he allowed Daley to draw him into the negotiation of an open-housing deal that was to prove toothless. (After King&#x27;s assassination, Alinsky argued that Woodlawn was the one black area of Chicago that did not &quot;explode into racial violence&quot; because, while their lives were not &quot;idyllic&quot;, with TWO people &quot;finally&quot; had a sense of &quot;power and achievement&quot;).

At the end of the sixties Alinsky complained that student activists had been more interested in &quot;revelation&quot; than in &quot;revolution,&quot; and that their campus politics was little more than street theater. From the perspective of real social change, he regarded their outraging of middle-class sensibilities to have been a tactical mistake.

==Later life==

===&quot;The myth of Saul Alinsky&quot; criticism===
In the summer of 1967, in an article in &quot;Dissent&quot;, Frank Riessman summarized a broader left-wing case against Alinsky. Seeking to explode &quot;The Myth of Saul Alinsky&quot;, Riessman argued that rather than politicize an area, Alinsky&#x27;s organizational efforts simply directed people &quot;into a kind of dead-end local activism.&quot; Alinsky&#x27;s opposition to large programs, broad goals, and ideology confused even those who participated in the local organizations because they find no context for their action. As a result, confined to what might be secured by purely local initiative, they achieved, at best, &quot;a better ghetto.&quot;

Riessman insisted that it was for the &quot;organizer-strategist-intellectual&quot; to &quot;provide the connections, the larger view that will lead to the development of a movement,&quot; but adding—&quot;this is not to suggest that the larger view should be imposed upon the local group.&quot; The New Left themselves seemed unable to strike the necessary balance. As they appeared to drift in events of the 1960s, failing above all to stop the war in Vietnam, Gitlin suggests that the SDS constructed their larger view &quot;on the cheap&quot;. Far from reconciling neighborhood agendas (welfare, rent, police harassment, garbage pick-up . . .) with radical ambition, their reheated revolutionary dogma prepared a &quot;left exit&quot; from community organizing, something that most New Left groups had effected by 1970.

Alinsky&#x27;s dismissal of Riessman as &quot;a little whining Pekingese,&quot; as someone he &quot;refused to debate with,&quot; might suggest that Alinsky was sensitive to the charge that the communities he helped organize were led into a political cul-de-sac. In 1964, he and Hoffman had agreed that The Woodlawn Organization was &quot;stymied.&quot; It staggered in the face of deteriorating housing, chronic unemployment, and bad schools in a political environment that was unfriendly-to-hostile. Unless they did something, TWO &quot;would go down.&quot; Alinsky was not a community-organizing purist. He saw the possibility of an electoral breakout: of Woodlawn helping mount a challenge to the incumbent in the 1966 Democratic-Party primary for the 2nd Congressional District. But Brazier, his preferred candidate, would not run and the community organization was fearful for its non-political tax-exempt status. In the end Daley&#x27;s political machine had little difficulty in rolling over the additional support galvanized for the reform-minded state legislator, Abner Mikva.

===&quot;Playboy&quot; interview===
In March 1972, &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine published a 24,000-word interview with Alinsky.

Alinsky was introduced as &quot;a bespectacled, conservatively dressed community organizer who looks like an accountant and talks like a stevedore,&quot; a figure &quot;hated and feared&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;in high places from coast to coast&quot;, and acknowledged by William F. Buckley Jr., &quot;a bitter ideological foe&quot;, as &quot;very close to an organizational genius&quot;. Levelling against him the charges of the New Left, the interview effectively invited Alinsky to summarize the lessons he had drawn for the new generation of activists in (a revision of an earlier work) &quot;Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals&quot;.

====Life cycle of organizations====
Alinsky was confronted with &quot;the tendency&quot; of communities he had helped organize to eventually &quot;join the establishment in return for their piece of the economic action&quot;, Back of the Yards, &quot;now one of the most vociferously segregationist areas of Chicago,&quot; being cited as a &quot;case in point&quot;. For Alinsky, this was only a &quot;challenge.&quot; It is &quot;a recurring pattern&quot;: &quot;Prosperity makes cowards of us all, and the Back of the Yards is no exception. They&#x27;ve entered the nightfall of their success, and their dreams of a better world have been replaced by nightmares of fear—fear of change, fear of losing their material goods, fear of blacks.&quot;

Alinsky explained that the life span of one of his organizations might be five years. After that it was either absorbed into administering programs (rather than building people power) or died. That was something that just had to be accepted, with the understanding that &quot;discrimination and deprivation does not automatically endow [the have-nots] with any special qualities.&quot; Perhaps he would move back into the area to organize &quot;a new movement to overthrow the one I built 25 years ago.&quot; Did he not find this process of co-optation discouraging? &quot;No. It&#x27;s the eternal problem.&quot; All life is a &quot;relay race of revolutions&quot;, each bringing society &quot;a little closer to the ultimate goal of real personal and social freedom.&quot;

But what were his &quot;so-called&quot; radical critics &quot;in fact saying&quot;? That when a community comes to him (&quot;we&#x27;re being shafted in every way&quot;) and ask for help, he should say, &quot;sorry . . .if you get power and win, then you&#x27;ll become, just like Back of the Yards, materialistic and all that, so just go on suffering, it is better for your souls&quot;? &quot;It&#x27;s kind of like a starving man coming up to you and begging you for a loaf of bread, and your telling him, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you realize that man doesn&#x27;t live by bread alone.&#x27; What a cop out.&quot;

Revolutionary youth may have &quot;few illusions about the system,&quot; but in &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot; Alinsky suggested &quot;they have plenty of illusions about the way to change our world.&quot; The &quot;liberal cliché about reconciliation of opposing forces,&quot; so often invoked in opposition to radical confrontation, may be &quot;a load of crap.&quot; &quot;Reconciliation means just one thing: when one side gets enough power, then the other side gets reconciled to it.&quot; But opposition to consensus politics does not mean opposition to compromise — &quot;just the opposite.&quot; &quot;In the world as it is, no victory is ever absolute&quot;. &quot;There is never nirvana.&quot; A &quot;society without compromise is totalitarian.&quot; And &quot;in the world as it is, the right things also invariably get done for the wrong reasons.&quot;

====Organizing the middle class====
For Alinsky, the real limitation of his organizing experience was that it had not extended into the middle-class majority:
Christ, even if we could manage to organize all the exploited low-income groups – all the blacks, chicanos, Puerto Ricans, poor whites – and then, through some kind of organizational miracle, weld them all together into a viable coalition, what would you have? At the most optimistic estimate, 55,000,000 people by the end of this decade – but by then the total population will be over 225,000,000, of whom the overwhelming majority will be middle class. . . . Pragmatically, the only hope for genuine minority progress is to seek out allies within the majority and to organize that majority itself as part of a national movement for change.

The middle classes may be &quot;conditioned to look for the safe and easy way, afraid to rock the boat,&quot; but Alinsky believed &quot;they&#x27;re beginning to realize the boat is sinking.&quot; On a wide range of issues, they feel &quot;more defeated and lost today than the poor do.&quot; They were, Alinsky insisted, &quot;good organizational material:&quot; &quot;more amorphous than some barrio in Southern California&quot;, so that &quot;you&#x27;re going to be organizing all across the country,&quot; but &quot;the rules are the same.&quot;

In 1968 he secured a year&#x27;s funding in Chicago from the Midas International Corporation to train white middle class suburban activists. As understood by corporate president Gordon Sherman, the proposition was that &quot;lack of organization in white neighborhoods can be as harmful to the total society as lack of organization in the black community. We all live in our own ghettos&quot;. Alinsky, however, never predicted exactly what form or direction middle-class organization would take. In Horwitt&#x27;s sympathetic view he was &quot;too empirical for that.&quot; He did suggest that &quot;the chance for organization for action on pollution, inflation, Vietnam, violence, race, taxes is all about us,&quot; making it clear that he envisaged organization based on a community of the interest rather than on the dubious neighborliness of the suburb.

In 1969 in Chicago, Alinsky and his IAF trainees helped initiate a city-wide Campaign Against Pollution (later to become the Citizens Action Program to Stop the Crosstown—a billion-dollar expressway). Alinsky was not beyond believing that such initiatives, scaled-up nationally, could &quot;move on to the larger issues: pollution in the Pentagon and Congress and the board rooms of the megacorporations.&quot; Challenging, but the alternative, Alinsky warned, was for the &quot;impotence&quot; of the middle classes to turn into &quot;political paranoia.&quot; This would make them &quot;ripe for the plucking by some guy on horseback promising a return to the vanished verities of yesterday.&quot;

== Death and family ==
On June 12, 1972, three months after the publication of the &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, Alinsky died, aged 63, from a heart attack while walking near his home in Carmel, California. 

Alinsky&#x27;s parents divorced when he was 18. He remained close to his mother, Farah Rice, who survived him. She acknowledged his national notoriety but not his politics. &quot;As a Jewish mother, she begins where other Jewish mothers leave off. . . it was all anti-climatic after I got that college degree.&quot;

Alinsky was married three times. His first wife, Helene Simon, whom he had met at the University of Chicago, drowned in 1947 while trying to save two children. Alinsky mourned her passing for many years. His second marriage to Jean Graham was also to take a tragic turn. A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis proved to be the onset of serious mental health problems and led to her hospitalization. Alinsky ended the marriage after several years but maintained regular contact. In the year before his death, he married Irene McInnis. He had two children from his first marriage, Kathryn Wilson and Lee David Alinsky.

==Legacy==

===Industrial Areas Foundation===
It has been suggested that &quot;Alinsky is to community organizing as Freud is to analysis.&quot; Having written about it, &quot;philosophized about it, and provided the first set of rules&quot;, he was the first to call attention to community organizing &quot;as a distinct program, with a life and literature of its own, separate from any particular cause such as the union movement or Populism.&quot; His biographer Sanford Horwitt credits Alinsky &quot;more than anybody ... for demonstrating that community organizing could be a lifelong career.&quot;

The Industrial Areas Foundation still claims to be &quot;the nation&#x27;s largest and longest-standing network of local faith and community-based organizations.&quot; They report &quot;victories&quot; on, among other issues, housing and neighborhood revitalization, public transport and infrastructure, living-wage jobs and workforce development, support for local labor unions, criminal justice reform, and tackling the opioid crisis.

When Alinsky died, Edward T. Chambers became the IAF&#x27;s executive director. Hundreds of professional community and labor organizers and thousands of community and labor leaders have been trained at its workshops. Fred Ross, who worked for Alinsky, was the principal mentor for Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Other organizations following in the tradition of the Congregation-based Community Organizing pioneered by IAF include PICO National Network, Gamaliel Foundation, Brooklyn Ecumenical Cooperatives, founded by former IAF trainer Richard Harmon, and Direct Action and Research Training Center (DART). Such had been their role in the IAF and its projects that on his &quot;Firing Line&quot; television program William F. Buckley introduced Alinsky as &quot;the pet revolutionary of the church people of America&quot;.

===People&#x27;s Action===
Chicago-based National People&#x27;s Action (NPA), a federation of 29 community organizing groups in 18 U.S. states, consciously committed to Alinsky&#x27;s bottom-up, door-to-door methodologies. It was co-founded in 1972 by Shel Trapp (1935–2010), who trained under Alinsky-trained organizer Tom Gaudet at the IAF. NPA&#x27;s successful national campaign to pass the Community Reinvestment Act CRA (1977) challenged the assertion that Alinsky-style organizing is only local and confined to winnable single-issue campaigns. In 2016, it coalesced with two other community-organizing networks to create People&#x27;s Action and the People&#x27;s Action [training] Institute, dedicated to building &quot;the power of poor and working people, in rural, suburban, and urban areas, to win change&quot; not only &quot;through issue campaigns&quot; but also, in clearer distinction to the IAF, through elections.

===Citizens UK and &quot;L&#x27;Institut Alinsky&quot;, France===
In 1989, following trainee experience with the IAF in Chicago, in England Neil Jameson established the Citizens Organising Foundation. Now Citizens UK, it supports communities in several cities, and since 2001 has been associated with the high-profile campaign for a living wage. 

Drawing inspiration from both Citizens UK and the IAF, in 2012 Alinsky&#x27;s community-organizing methods were tried in France leading to the creation in Grenoble of the &quot;Alliance Citoyenne&quot; (Citizens Alliance). Similar initiatives followed in Rennes in 2014, in Aubervilliers, in Seine St Denis in 2016 and in the Lyon metropolitan area in 2019.

In October 2017, the leaders of the &quot;Alliance Citoyenne&quot; and the researchers Julien Talpin and Hélène Balazard founded the Alinsky Institute, a think tank and training organization to develop and promote methods of citizen empowerment in blue-collar and immigrant suburbs (&quot;banlieues&quot;) which, with the decline in the traditional parties of the left, have had little political voice. 

An assessment of Institute&#x27;s work suggested that a critical problem for &quot;Alinskyism&quot; is the activists’ &quot;need for recognition&quot;: &quot;when they practice community organizing, the dozens of hours they devote to political struggle are in fact erased in favor of the inhabitants trained in mobilization&quot;. More controversially, because of the alleged political partisanship, critics observe that the Alinsky Institute has trained leading activists in &quot;La France insoumise&quot;.

In Germany in 1993, two of Alinsky&#x27;s students and co-workers, Don Elmer (Center for Community Change, San Francisco) and Ed Shurna (Interfaith Organizing Project and Gamaliel Foundation, Chicago) initiated the first training courses in &quot;Community Organizing&quot; (CO), supported by several local projects. Assisted by the Catholic University of Applied Social Sciences, the first community organization (&quot;Bürgerplattform&quot;) based on Alinsky&#x27;s principles was established in a Berlin neighborhood in 2002.

===&quot;Alinskyism&quot;===
Among political activists on the left, Alinsky’s legacy continues to be disputed. Cautions against looking to Alinsky for &quot;a road map&quot; to &quot;rebuild power in the age of Trump&quot; repeat the charge of the New Left: &quot;&#x27;Alinskyism&#x27; — apolitical &#x27;single-issue&#x27; campaigns that focus on &#x27;winnable demands&#x27; run by a well-oiled, staff-heavy organization—shut the door to more democratic and transformational forms of working-class mobilization.&quot; At the same time, Alinsky has been rediscovered and defended as an inspiration for the Occupy movement and the mobilization for climate action. Activists for Extinction Rebellion (XR), founded in Britain, cite &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot; as a source of inspiration as to &quot;how we mobilise to cope with emergency&quot;, and &quot;strike a balance between disruption and creativity&quot;. XR co-founder, Roger Hallam, has been clear that the strategy of public disruption is &quot;heavily influenced&quot; by Alinsky: &quot;The essential element here is disruption. Without disruption, no one is going to give you their eyeballs&quot;. 

The Israeli journalist and pro-Settler activist David Bedein views Alinsky as a major influence on his work.

In 2020, the Reuters Agency &quot;fact check team&quot; noted that viral images on social media were circulating quotes attributed to &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot; and &quot;Reveille for Radicals&quot;, which suggest that Alinsky set out eight fundamental rules for creating a &quot;social state&quot;. The text in the images seems to equate this in turn with Soviet communism. The quotes attributed to Alinsky, however, were not found in his writings.

===Appropriation by the Tea Party movement===
In the 2000s, &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot; did develop as a primer for middle-class mobilization, but it was of a kind and in a direction—the return to &quot;vanished verities&quot;—that Alinsky had feared. As did William F. Buckley in the 1960s, a new generation of libertarian, right-wing populist, and conservative activists seemed willing to admire Alinsky&#x27;s disruptive organizing talents while rejecting his social-justice politics. &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot;, and adaptations of the book, began circulating among Republican Party Tea Party activists. According to spokesman Adam Brandon, the conservative non-profit organization FreedomWorks distributed a short adaptation of Alinsky&#x27;s work, &quot;Rules for Patriots&quot;, through its entire network. Former Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey is also reported to have given copies of Alinsky&#x27;s book to leaders of the Tea Party movement. In &quot;Rules for Conservative Radicals&quot; (2009) Michael Patrick Leahy, an early Tea Party leader, offered &quot;sixteen rules for conservative radicals based on lessons from Saul Alinsky, the Tea Party Movement, and the Apostle Paul&quot;.

===Linked to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama===
Once it appeared that links could be drawn between Alinsky and two major Democratic-Party presidential hopefuls, Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator, later President, Barack Obama, conservatives were interested less in appropriating from the organizing tactician, than in profiling Alinsky as a far-left radical. Alinsky, it was discovered, had been the subject of then Hillary Rodham&#x27;s senior college thesis. Clinton had not been uncritical. Alinsky believed that community leaders who generate pressure on the system from the outside could produce more effective change than the lofty lever-pullers on the inside. But Clinton argued that suburbanization and a federal consolidation of power meant change needed to be achieved at levels that Alinsky&#x27;s model was not designed to target. Nonetheless, her conclusion allowed that Alinsky &quot;has been feared – just as Eugene Debs or Walt Whitman or Martin Luther King has been feared, because each embraced the most radical of political faiths — democracy.&quot;

For three years, from June 1985 to May 1988, Obama was the director of the Developing Communities Project (DCP), a church-based community organization on Chicago&#x27;s far South Side. Alinsky biographer Sanford Horwitt, saw the influence of Alinsky&#x27;s teaching not only on Obama&#x27;s work in Chicago but also on his successful 2008 presidential run. Yet Obama too commented on having seen &quot;the limits of what can be achieved&quot; at the community level. He also expressed the view that &quot;Alinsky understated the degree to which people&#x27;s hopes and dreams and their ideals and their values were just as important in organizing as people&#x27;s self-interest.&quot; Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), a friend of Obama&#x27;s, saw another difference. &quot;If you read Alinsky&#x27;s teachings, there are times he&#x27;s confrontational. I have not seen that in Barack. He&#x27;s always looking for ways to connect.&quot;

===Right-wing controversy===
In his 1996 biography of her, &quot;The Seduction of Hillary Rodham&quot;, David Brock dubbed Hillary Clinton &quot;Alinsky&#x27;s daughter.&quot; Barbara Olson began each chapter of her 1999 book on Clinton, &quot;Hell to Pay&quot;, with a quote from Alinsky, and argued that his strategic theories directly influenced her behavior during her husband&#x27;s presidency. In 1993, Clinton asked Wellesley College to seal her thesis on Alinsky for the duration of her husband&#x27;s presidency.

As his candidacy gained strength, and once he had defeated Clinton for the Democratic Party nomination, attention shifted to Obama&#x27;s ties to Alinsky. Monica Crowley, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, and Rush Limbaugh repeatedly drew a connection, with the latter asking, &quot;Has [Obama] ever had an original idea — by that, I mean something not found in The Communist Manifesto? Has he? Has he simply had an idea not found in Saul Alinsky&#x27;s Rules for Radicals?&quot; Glenn Beck produced a four-part radio series to expose Alinsky&#x27;s &quot;vision for a Godless, centrally controlled utopia.&quot; In &quot;Barack Obama&#x27;s Rules for Revolution: The Alinsky Model&quot; (2009) David Horowitz argued &quot;the roots&quot; of his administration&#x27;s &quot;effort to subject America to a wholesale transformation&quot; were to be found in the teachings of &quot;the guru of Sixties radicals&quot;—an Alinsky admonition to be &quot;flexible and opportunistic and say anything to get power.&quot;

==Epitaph==
As an epitaph for Alinsky, his biographer Sanford Horwitt wrote:Alinsky was a true believer in the possibilities of American democracy as a means to social justice. He saw it as a great political game among competing interests, a game in which there are few fixed boundaries and where the rules could be changed to help make losers into winners and vice versa. He loved to play the game...

<doc id="180908" wikidata="Q18994" url="?curid=180908" title="Luise Rainer">
<text>Luise Rainer ( , ; 12 January 1910 – 30 December 2014) was a German-born film actress. She was the first thespian to win multiple Academy Awards, and the first to win back-to-back; at the time of her death, thirteen days shy of her 105th birthday, she was the longest-lived Oscar recipient (and the longest-lived female star from Classic Hollywood), a superlative that has not been exceeded, as of 2025.

Rainer started her acting career in Germany at age 16, under the tutelage of Austria&#x27;s leading stage director, Max Reinhardt. Within a few years, she had become a distinguished Berlin stage actress with Reinhardt&#x27;s Vienna theater ensemble. Critics highly praised the quality of her acting. After years of acting on stage and in films in Austria and Germany, she was discovered by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer talent scouts, who signed her to a three-year contract in Hollywood in 1935. A number of filmmakers predicted she might become another Greta Garbo, MGM&#x27;s leading female star at the time.

Her first American film role was in &quot;Escapade&quot; in 1935. The following year she was given a supporting part in the musical biography &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;, where, despite limited appearances, her emotion-filled performance so impressed audiences that she was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress. She was later dubbed the &quot;Viennese teardrop&quot; for her dramatic telephone scene in the film. For her next role, producer Irving Thalberg was convinced, despite the studio&#x27;s disagreement, that she would also be able to play the part of a poor, plain Chinese farm wife in &quot;The Good Earth&quot; (1937), based on Pearl Buck&#x27;s novel about hardship in China. The subdued character role was such a dramatic contrast to her previous vivacious character that she again won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Rainer, Jodie Foster and Hilary Swank are the only actresses ever to win two Oscars by the age of 30.

However, she later stated nothing worse could have happened to her than winning two consecutive Oscars, as audience expectations from then on would be too high to fulfill. After a string of insignificant roles, MGM and Rainer became disappointed, leading her to end her brief three-year film career, soon returning to Europe. Adding to her rapid decline, some feel, was the poor career advice she received from her then-husband, playwright Clifford Odets, along with the unexpected death at age 37 of her producer, Irving Thalberg, whom she greatly admired. Some film historians consider her the &quot;most extreme case of an Oscar victim in Hollywood mythology&quot;.

==Early life and career==
The daughter of Heinrich and Emilie (née Königsberger) Rainer, known familiarly as &quot;Heinz&quot; and &quot;Emmy&quot;, Rainer was born on 12 January 1910 in Düsseldorf, Germany and raised in Hamburg and later in Vienna, Austria. Some sources list her birthplace as Vienna. Describing her childhood, she stated, &quot;I was born into a world of destruction. The Vienna of my childhood was one of starvation, poverty and revolution.&quot; Her father was a businessman who settled in Europe after spending most of his childhood in Texas, where he was sent at the age of six as an orphan. (Rainer had stated that because of her father, she is an American citizen &quot;by birth&quot;.) Rainer&#x27;s family was upper-class and Jewish.
Rainer had two brothers and was a premature baby, born two months early. She describes her father as being &quot;possessive&quot; and &quot;tempestuous&quot;, but whose affections and concern were centered on her. Luise seemed to him as &quot;eternally absent-minded&quot; and &quot;very different&quot;. She remembers his &quot;tyrannical possessiveness&quot;, and was saddened to see her mother, &quot;a beautiful pianist, and a woman of warmth and intelligence and deeply in love with her husband, suffering similarly&quot;. Although generally shy at home, she was immensely athletic in school, becoming a champion runner and a fearless mountain climber. Rainer said she became an actress to help expend her physical and overly emotional energy. It was her father&#x27;s wish, however, that she attend a good finishing school and &quot;marry the right man.&quot; Rainer&#x27;s rebellious nature made her appear to be more of a &quot;tomboy&quot; and happy to be alone. She also feared she might develop what she saw as her mother&#x27;s &quot;inferiority complex&quot;.

She was only six when she decided to become part of the entertainment world, and recalled being inspired by watching a circus act:

I thought that a man on the wire was marvelous, in his spangles and tights. I wanted to run away and marry him but I never had an opportunity. I am sure, though, that the experience first disclosed to me the entertainment world. For years I longed to be able to walk on a tight wire, too.
At age 16, Rainer chose to follow her dream to become an actress; under the pretext of visiting her mother, she traveled to Düsseldorf for a prearranged audition at the Dumont Theater.

In the 1920s the theatre director Louise Dumont separated from her husband. Dumont was attached to a number of young actresses including Fita Benkhoff, Hanni Hoessrich, and Rainer. It has been presumed that Dumont was bisexual.

Rainer later began studying acting with Max Reinhardt, and, by the time she was 18, there was already an &quot;army of critics&quot; who felt that she had unusual talent for a young actress. She soon became a distinguished Berlin stage actress as a member of Reinhardt&#x27;s Vienna theater ensemble. Her first stage appearance was at the Dumont Theater in 1928, followed by other appearances, including Jacques Deval&#x27;s play &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;Men in White&quot;, George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, and Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;.

In 1934, after appearing in several German language films, she was seen performing in the play &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; by MGM talent scout Phil Berg, who offered her a three-year contract in Hollywood. He thought she would appeal to the same audience as Swedish MGM star Greta Garbo. Initially, Rainer had no interest in films, saying in a 1935 interview: &quot;I never wanted to film. I was only for the theater. Then I saw &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; and right away I wanted to film. It was so beautiful.&quot;

==Hollywood career==
===Early roles===
Rainer moved to Hollywood in 1935 as a hopeful new star. Biographer Charles Higham notes that MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer and story editor Samuel Marx had seen footage of Rainer before she came to Hollywood, and both felt she had the looks, charm, and especially a &quot;certain tender vulnerability&quot; that Mayer admired in female stars. Because of her poor command of English, Mayer assigned actress Constance Collier to train her in correct speech and dramatic modulation, and Rainer&#x27;s English improved rapidly.

Her first film role in Hollywood was in &quot;Escapade&quot; (1935), a remake of one of her Austrian films, co-starring William Powell. She received the part after Myrna Loy gave up her role halfway through filming. After seeing the preview, Rainer ran out of the cinema displeased with how she appeared: &quot;On the screen, I looked so big and full of face, it was awful.&quot; The film generated immense publicity for Rainer, who was hailed as &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s next sensation.&quot; However, she did not like giving interviews, explaining:

Stars are not important, only what they do as a part of their work is important. Artists need quiet in which to grow. It seems Hollywood does not like to give them this quiet. Stardom is bad because Hollywood makes too much of it, there is too much &#x27;bowing down&#x27; before stars. Stardom is weight pressing down over the head — and one must grow upward or not at all.

===&quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; (1936)===

Rainer&#x27;s next performance was as the real-life character Anna Held in the musical biography &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;, again co-starring William Powell. Powell, impressed by Rainer&#x27;s acting skill, had given her equal billing in &quot;Escapade&quot;.

According to Higham, Irving Thalberg felt that only Rainer, of all the studio&#x27;s stars, could play the part as he saw it. But Rainer recalled that studio head Mayer did not want her playing the part, seeing it as too small: &quot;You are a star now and can&#x27;t do it,&quot; he insisted. Shortly after shooting began in late 1935, doubts of Rainer&#x27;s ability to pull off the role emerged in the press. She was criticized for not resembling the Polish-born stage performer. The director admitted that the main reason Rainer was cast was her eyes, claiming that they &quot;are just as large, just as lustrous, and contain the same tantalizing quality of pseudo naughtiness&quot; the part required.

As Thalberg expected, she successfully expressed the &quot;coquettishness, wide-eyed charm, and vulnerability&quot; required. Rainer &quot;so impressed audiences with one highly emotional scene,&quot; wrote biographer Charles Affron, that she received the Academy Award for Best Actress. In one scene, for example, her character is speaking to her ex-husband Florenz Ziegfeld over the telephone, attempting to congratulate him on his new marriage: &quot;The camera records her agitation; Ziegfeld hears a voice that hovers between false gaiety and despair; when she hangs up she dissolves into tears.&quot;

Powell, having worked with her in two films, gave his impressions of her acting style and quality:

She is one of the most natural persons I have ever known. Moreover, she is generous, patient and possesses a magnificent sense of humor. She is an extremely sensitive organism and has a great comprehension of human nature. She has judgment and an abiding understanding which make it possible for her to portray human emotion poignantly and truly. Definitely a creative artist, she comprehends life and its significance. Everything she does has been subjected to painstaking analysis. She thinks over every shade of emotion to make it ring true. In Europe she is a great stage star. She deserves to be a star. Unmistakably she has all the qualities.

On the evening of the Academy Award ceremonies, Rainer remained at home, not expecting to win. When Mayer learned she had won, he sent MGM publicity head Howard Strickling racing to her home to get her. When she finally arrived, master of ceremonies George Jessel, during the commotion, made the mistake of introducing Rainer, which Bette Davis had been scheduled to do. She was also awarded the New York Film Critics&#x27; Award for the role.

===&quot;The Good Earth&quot; (1937)===
Rainer&#x27;s next film was &quot;The Good Earth&quot; (1937), in which she co-starred with Paul Muni; she had been picked as the most likely choice for the female lead in September 1935. The role, however, was completely the opposite of her Anna Held character, as she was required to portray a humble Chinese peasant subservient to her husband and speaking little during the entire film. Her comparative muteness, stated historian Andrew Sarris, was &quot;an astounding tour de force after her hysterically chattering telephone scene in &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;&quot;, and contributed to her winning her second Best Actress Oscar.

The award made her the first actress to win two consecutive Oscars, a feat not matched until Katharine Hepburn&#x27;s two wins thirty years later. In later years, however, Rainer felt that winning the two Oscars so early may have been the &quot;worst possible thing&quot; to befall her career. She said that it made her &quot;work all the harder now to prove the Academy was right.&quot;

Rainer later recalled early conflicts even before production. Studio head Louis B. Mayer, for example, did not approve of the film being produced or her part in it, wanting her to remain a glamorous film star: &quot;He was horrified at Irving Thalberg&#x27;s insistence for me to play O-lan, the poor uncomely little Chinese peasant,&quot; she said. &quot;I myself, with the meager dialogue given to me, feared to be a hilarious bore.&quot; Rainer remembered hearing Mayer&#x27;s comments to Thalberg, her producer: &quot;She has to be a dismal-looking slave and grow old; but Luise is a young girl; we just have made her glamorous — what are you doing?&quot; She considered the part as one of the &quot;greatest achievements&quot; in her career, stating that she was allowed to express &quot;realism,&quot; even refusing to &quot;wear the rubber mask &#x27;Chinese look,&#x27;&quot; suggested by the makeup department. She was allowed to act &quot;genuine, honest, and down-to-earth,&quot; she said.

Other serious problems took place during production. Director George W. Hill, who had spent several months in China filming backgrounds and atmospheric scenes, committed suicide soon after returning to Hollywood. The filming was postponed until Sidney Franklin could take over. A few months later, before the film was completed, Irving Thalberg died suddenly at the age of 37. Rainer commented years later, &quot;His dying was a terrible shock to us. He was young and ever so able. Had it not been that he died, I think I may have stayed much longer in films.&quot; The film&#x27;s opening screen credit includes a dedication to Thalberg: &quot;To the Memory of Irving Grant Thalberg – his last greatest achievement – we dedicate this picture.&quot;
In late 1936, MGM conceived a script called &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; especially for Rainer. The project was shelved and eventually released as &quot;Bridal Suite&quot; in 1939, starring Annabella as &#x27;Luise&#x27;. Another 1936 unrealized film project that involved Rainer was &quot;Adventure for Three&quot;, which would have co-starred William Powell. In 1938, she played Johann Strauss&#x27;s long-suffering wife Poldi in the successful Oscar-winning MGM musical biopic &quot;The Great Waltz&quot;, her last big hit.

Her four other films for MGM, &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Candlesticks&quot; (1937), &quot;Big City&quot; (1937) with Spencer Tracy, &quot;The Toy Wife&quot; (1938) and &quot;Dramatic School&quot; (1938), were ill-advised and not well received, though Rainer continued to receive praise. &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Candlesticks&quot;, in which Rainer was cast in November 1936, reunited Rainer with Powell for the final time. For the film, she wore a red wig and wore costumes designed by Adrian, who claimed that Rainer, by the end of 1937, would become one of Hollywood&#x27;s most influential people in fashion. On set, she received star treatment, having her own dressing room, diction teacher, secretary, wardrobe woman, hairdresser, and makeup artist. &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Candlesticks&quot; was Rainer&#x27;s first film for which she received criticism, it being claimed that she did not improve in her acting technique.
Even though reviews of Rainer&#x27;s performance in &quot;Big City&quot; were favorable, reviewers agreed that she was miscast in a &#x27;modern role&#x27; and looked &quot;too exotic&quot; as Tracy&#x27;s wife. Despite the criticism and announcements of leaving Hollywood, Rainer renewed her contract for seven years shortly after the film&#x27;s release.

Most critics agreed Rainer was &quot;at her most appealing&quot; in &quot;The Toy Wife&quot;. The final MGM film Rainer made was &quot;Dramatic School&quot;. At the time she was cast in the film, her box office popularity had declined considerably, and she was one of the many well-known stars—along with MGM colleagues Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, and Norma Shearer, and Katharine Hepburn, Mae West, Fred Astaire, Kay Francis and others—dubbed &quot;Box Office Poison&quot; by the Independent Theatre Owners of America.

Rainer refused to be stereotyped or to knuckle under to the studio system, and studio head Mayer was unsympathetic to her demands for serious roles. Furthermore, she began to fight for a higher salary, and was reported as being difficult and temperamental. As a result, she missed out on several roles, including the female lead in the Edward G. Robinson gangster film &quot;The Last Gangster&quot; (1937), losing out to another Viennese actress, Rose Stradner. Speaking of Mayer decades later, Rainer recalled, &quot;He said, &#x27;We made you and we are going to destroy you.&#x27; Well, he tried his best.&quot;

===Departure from Hollywood===

Rainer made her final film appearance for MGM in 1938 and abandoned the film industry. In a 1983 interview, the actress told how she went to Louis B. Mayer&#x27;s office and said to him: &quot;Mr Mayer, I must stop making films. My source has dried up. I work from the inside out, and there is nothing inside to give.&quot; Following this altercation, she traveled to Europe, where she helped get aid to children who were victims of the Spanish Civil War. Nevertheless, she was not released from her contract and, by 1940, she was still bound to make one more film for the studio.

Disenchanted with Hollywood, where she later said it was impossible to have an intellectual conversation, she moved to New York City in 1940 to live with playwright Clifford Odets, whom she had married in 1937. Rainer had never made it a secret that she felt terrible as Odets&#x27; wife, and exclaimed in a 1938 interview: &quot;All the acting I&#x27;ve done on the stage or screen has been nothing compared to the acting I did in New York, when I tried to make everyone think I was happy – and my heart was breaking.&quot; She filed for divorce in mid-1938, but proceedings were delayed &quot;to next October&quot; when Odets went to England. The divorce was final on 14 May 1940. Rainer and Odets summered at Pine Brook Country Club in Nichols, Connecticut, where numerous other members of the Group Theatre (New York) also spent the summer of 1936, both acting and writing.

Despite the negativity, Rainer was one of the actresses considered for the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (1939), but the idea was not well-received, and she was not given a screen test. She also was unable to persuade MGM bosses to cast her in &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot;, based on a 1940 play about a deaf-mute rape victim.

In a later interview, Rainer commented about her disappearance from the movie industry:

I was very young. There were a lot of things I was unprepared for. I was too honest, I talked serious instead of with my eyelashes and Hollywood thought I was cuckoo. I worked in seven big pictures in three years. I have to be inspired to give a good performance. I complained to a studio executive that the source was dried up. The executive told me, &#x27;Why worry about the source. Let the director worry about that.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t run away from anybody in Hollywood. I ran away from myself.

==Later life and career==

While in Europe, Rainer studied medicine and explained she loved being accepted as &quot;just another student&quot;, rather than as a screen actress. She returned to the stage and made her first appearance at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, on 1 May 1939 as Françoise in Jacques Deval&#x27;s play &quot;Behold the Bride&quot;; she played the same part in her London debut at the Shaftesbury Theatre on 23 May. Returning to America, she played the lead in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot; on 10 March 1940 at the Belasco Theatre in Washington, D.C. under the direction of German emigrant director Erwin Piscator. She made her first appearance on the New York stage at the Music Box Theatre in May 1942 as Miss Thing in J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;A Kiss for Cinderella&quot;.

She made an appearance in &quot;Hostages&quot; in 1943 and abandoned film making in 1944 after marrying publisher Robert Knittel. She initially did not plan on returning to the screen, but explained her comeback in 1943 by saying:

All the professor and the other students cared about was whether I could answer the questions, not whether I could come to class looking glamorous. But after that brief return to the stage, I began to realize that all the doors which had been opened to me in Europe, and all the work I had been able to accomplish for refugee children, was due to the fact that people knew me from my screen work. I began to feel a sense of responsibility to a job which I had started and never finished. When I also felt, after that experience at Dennis, that perhaps I did have talent after all, and that my too-sudden stardom was not just a matter of happy accident, I decided to go back.

When Rainer returned to Hollywood, her contract at MGM had long expired and she had no agent. David Rose, head of Paramount Pictures, offered her a starring role in an English film shot on location, but war conditions prevented her from accepting the role. Instead, Rose suggested in 1942 that she make a screen test for the lead role in &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943), but Ingrid Bergman was cast. Rainer eventually settled on a role in &quot;Hostages&quot; (1943) and told the press about the role: &quot;It&#x27;s certainly not an Academy Award part, and thank goodness, my bosses don&#x27;t expect me to win an award with it. ... No, this is something unspectacular but I hope, a step back in the right direction.&quot;
Rainer took her oath of allegiance to the United States in the 1940s, but she and Knittel lived in the UK and Switzerland for most of their marriage. Robert Knittel died in 1989. The couple had one daughter, Francesca Knittel, now known as Francesca Knittel-Bowyer. Rainer had two granddaughters, Luisa and Nicole, and two great-grandchildren, Luca and Hunter.

Federico Fellini enticed her to play the cameo role of Dolores in his 1960 Oscar-winning classic &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, to the point of her travelling to the Rome location, but she quit the production prior to shooting, a fact that has been attributed either to her resistance to an unwanted sex scene or to her insistence on overseeing her own dialogue. The role was later cut from the eventual screenplay. She made sporadic television and stage appearances following her and her husband&#x27;s move to Britain, appearing in an episode of the World War II television series &quot;Combat!&quot; in 1965. She took a dual role in a 1984 episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. For the latter, she received a standing ovation from the crew. She appeared in &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1997) in a small role, marking her film comeback at the age of 86. She made appearances at the 1998 and 2003 Academy Awards ceremonies as part of special retrospective tributes to past Oscar winners.

On 12 January 2010, Rainer celebrated her centenary in London. Actor Sir Ian McKellen was one of her guests. During that month, she was present at the British Film Institute tribute to her at the National Film Theatre, where she was interviewed by Richard Stirling before screenings of &quot;The Good Earth&quot; and &quot;The Great Waltz&quot;. She also appeared onstage at the National Theatre, where she was interviewed by Sir Christopher Frayling. In April 2010, she returned to Hollywood to present a TCM festival screening of &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, accompanied by an interview with host Robert Osborne.
Rainer has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6300 Hollywood Boulevard.

On 5 September 2011, then 101-year-old Rainer travelled to Berlin to receive a star on the Boulevard der Stars. Her star was among the 21 stars issued in 2011 and followed the 20 that were issued in 2010. The star was issued as an exception and was not without controversy. Rainer had been forgotten when the Boulevard der Stars opened in 2010, despite being Germany&#x27;s only Academy Award-winning actress. In 2011, she was initially rejected by the jury (Senta Berger, Gero Gandert, Uwe Kammann, Dieter Kosslick and Hans Helmut Prinzler) despite being nominated. A prolonged campaign started in October 2010, led by music executive Paul Baylay, who had noticed Rainer&#x27;s omission on the Boulevard. Baylay campaigned in Germany, lobbying press and politicians to support the campaign to have the actress and her work recognised. The campaign was supported by the Central Council of Jews. In August 2011, the Boulevard der Stars finally relented, acknowledging the Facebook, email, and letter campaign led by Baylay had been key in their decision to awarding an extra star to Rainer.

==Death==
Rainer died at her London home on 30 December 2014 at the age of 104 from pneumonia. She was 13 days shy of her 105th birthday.
Rainer spent her final years living in a flat formerly occupied by actress Vivien Leigh at 54 Eaton Square, Belgravia, London. Her memorabilia were auctioned in 2015. The auction netted US$489,069 for her heirs.

==Acting style==
Rainer is best known for winning back-to-back Academy Awards, although she received criticism for being &quot;an excessive actress, larger than life, probably more suited to the Viennese and German stage of her youth than anywhere else.&quot;

<doc id="180912" wikidata="Q827494" url="?curid=180912" title="Theodora Goes Wild">
<text>Theodora Goes Wild is a 1936 American screwball comedy film that tells the story of the residents in a small town who are incensed by a risqué novel, unaware that the book was written under a pseudonym by a member of the town&#x27;s leading family. It stars Irene Dunne and Melvyn Douglas and was directed by Richard Boleslawski. The film was written by Mary McCarthy and Sidney Buchman. Dunne was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress in a Leading Role and the movie was also nominated for the Best Film Editing.

Before this film, Dunne had been cast in dramatic films. &quot;Theodora Goes Wild&quot; was her first comedy, and this extremely popular film proved to be the beginning of a new phase in her film career as a screen comedienne.

==Plot==
Theodora Lynn (Irene Dunne) is a Sunday school teacher and former church organist in Lynnfield, Connecticut, raised by two spinster aunts, Mary (Elisabeth Risdon) and Elsie Lynn (Margaret McWade). She also happens to be, under the pen name Caroline Adams, the secret author of a sensational, bestselling book replete with sexual innuendo that has the straight-laced all-female Lynnfield Literary Circle in an uproar. The book is serialized in the local newspaper, and the Literary Circle, led by outraged busybody Rebecca Perry (Spring Byington), forces the newspaper&#x27;s owner Jed Waterbury (Thomas Mitchell) to stop printing the salacious installments.

Theodora travels to New York City on the pretext of visiting her black sheep Uncle John (Robert Greig), but actually goes to see her publisher Arthur Stevenson (Thurston Hall). Though Stevenson reassures an anxious Theodora that only he and his secretary know her identity, his wife Ethel (Nana Bryant) pressures him into an introduction, which the book&#x27;s illustrator Michael Grant (Melvyn Douglas) overhears. Intrigued, Michael invites himself to a sumptuous dinner with the Stevensons and Theodora. Theodora becomes annoyed when Michael smugly assumes that she is a teetotaler, so she orders a whiskey. As the night goes on, she becomes drunk. So does Ethel, forcing Arthur to take her home and leaving Theodora alone with Michael in the posh restaurant. When he brings her to his apartment and then makes a pass at her, she panics and flees, much to his amusement.

Michael tracks her to her hometown, and his whistling is immediately noticed outside her house. Because she technically is not supposed to know anyone outside of Lynnfield, he coerces her into hiring him as a gardener, thus scandalizing her aunts and providing Rebecca Perry with ample information for gossip. Michael declares that he is going to break Theodora out of her confining routine, ignoring her protests that she likes her life just the way it is. Despite herself, she enjoys herself when Michael makes her go berry-picking and fishing with him. Finally, she finds the nerve to tell the disapproving women of the Literary Circle that she loves him. When she tells Michael what she has done, however, he is less than thrilled.

The next morning, Theodora finds that he has gone back to New York and left her. She tracks him to his Park Avenue apartment. He admits he loves her, but then his father (Henry Kolker), the lieutenant governor, shows up, followed by Michael&#x27;s estranged wife Agnes (Leona Maricle). Lt. Gov. Grant tells his son Michael that he and Agnes must remain married to avoid causing a political scandal for him. Michael is unable to stand up to his father.

Theodora determines to free Michael from his father, just as he had done for her. He wants her to hold off until his father&#x27;s term ends in two years, but she is unwilling to wait that long. She courts publicity by revealing herself as the true Caroline Adams. She stays in Michael&#x27;s New York apartment, even though he has moved out to get away from her, and she tells the press of her intention to publish a new book that details finding romance in her small town and searching for someone who will call her &quot;baby&quot; – a story that depicts her relationship with Michael. Meanwhile, Michael denies to the press that he has even met Theodora. She finally crashes the governor&#x27;s ball and arranges for reporters to photograph her embracing Michael. Agnes seeks a divorce from Michael to save face.

Theodora returns to Lynnfield and is warmly welcomed as a celebrity, even by her now-supportive aunts. She causes further talk when she brings a newborn baby with her. When Michael, now divorced, sees the child, he tries to flee, but then Theodora reveals that the baby belongs to Rebecca Perry&#x27;s own secretly married daughter, and not to her.

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1937, Graham Greene gave the film a good review, comparing the film&#x27;s light comedy to &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;, and commenting that Dunne&#x27;s acting had been &quot;regroomed&quot; and improved considerably since her earlier films and that she now &quot;appears as one of the best comedians on the screen&quot;.

<text>Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev ( ; ; – ) was a Russian novelist, short story writer, poet, playwright, translator and popularizer of Russian literature in the West.

His first major publication, a short story collection titled &quot;A Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches&quot; (1852), was a milestone of Russian realism. His novel &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; (1862) is regarded as one of the major works of 19th-century fiction.

==Life==
Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev was born in Oryol (modern-day Oryol Oblast, Russia) to noble Russian parents Sergei Nikolaevich Turgenev (1793–1834), a colonel in the Russian cavalry who took part in the Patriotic War of 1812, and Varvara Petrovna Turgeneva (née Lutovinova; 1787–1850). His father belonged to an old, but impoverished Turgenev family of Tula aristocracy that traces its history to the 15th century when a Tatar Mirza Lev Turgen (Ivan Turgenev after baptizing) left the Golden Horde to serve Vasily II of Moscow. Ivan&#x27;s mother came from a wealthy noble Lutovinov house of the Oryol Governorate. She spent an unhappy childhood under her tyrannical stepfather and left his house after her mother&#x27;s death to live with her uncle. At age 26, she inherited a huge fortune from him. In 1816, she married Turgenev.

Ivan and his brothers Nikolai and Sergei were raised by their mother, an educated, authoritarian woman. Their residence was the Spasskoye-Lutovinovo family estate that was granted to their ancestor Ivan Ivanovich Lutovinov by Ivan the Terrible. Varvara Turgeneva later served as an inspiration for the landlady from Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;Mumu&quot;. The brothers had foreign governesses; Ivan became fluent in French, German, and English. The family members used French in everyday life, including prayers. Their father spent little time with the family. Although he was not hostile toward them, his absence hurt Ivan&#x27;s feelings. Their relations are described in the autobiographical novel &quot;First Love&quot;. When Ivan was four years old, the family journeyed through Germany and France. In 1827, the Turgenevs relocated to Moscow to enable the children to have a proper education.

After the standard schooling for a son of a gentleman, Turgenev studied for one year at the University of Moscow and then moved to the University of Saint Petersburg from 1834 to 1837, focusing on Classics, Russian literature, and philology. During that time his father died from kidney stone disease, followed by his younger brother Sergei who died from epilepsy. From 1838 until 1841, he studied philosophy, particularly Hegel, and history at the University of Berlin. He returned to Saint Petersburg to complete his master&#x27;s examination.

Turgenev was impressed with German society and returned home believing that Russia could best improve itself by incorporating ideas from the Age of Enlightenment. Like many of his educated contemporaries, he was particularly opposed to serfdom. In 1841, Turgenev started his career in the Russian civil service and spent two years working for the Ministry of Interior (1843–1845).

When Turgenev was a child, a family serf had read to him verses from the &quot;Rossiad&quot; of Mikhail Kheraskov, a celebrated poet of the 18th century. Turgenev&#x27;s early attempts in literature, poems, and sketches gave indications of genius and were favorably spoken of by Vissarion Belinsky, then the leading Russian literary critic. During the latter part of his life, Turgenev did not reside much in Russia: he lived either at Baden-Baden or Paris, often in proximity to the family of the celebrated opera singer Pauline Viardot, with whom he had a lifelong affair.

Turgenev never married, but he had some affairs with his family&#x27;s serfs, one of which resulted in the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Paulinette. He was tall and broad-shouldered, but was timid, restrained, and soft-spoken. When Turgenev was 19, while traveling on a steamboat in Germany, the boat caught fire. According to rumours by Turgenev&#x27;s enemies, he reacted in a cowardly manner. He denied such accounts, but these rumours circulated in Russia and followed him for his entire career, providing the basis for his story &quot;A Fire at Sea&quot;. His closest literary friend was Gustave Flaubert, with whom he shared similar social and aesthetic ideas. Both rejected extremist right and left political views, and carried a nonjudgmental, although rather pessimistic, view of the world. His relations with Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were often strained, as the two were, for various reasons, dismayed by Turgenev&#x27;s seeming preference for Western Europe.

Unlike Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, Turgenev lacked religious motives in his writings, representing the more social aspect to the reform movement. He was considered to be an agnostic. Tolstoy, more than Dostoyevsky, at first anyway, rather despised Turgenev. While traveling together in Paris, Tolstoy wrote in his diary, &quot;Turgenev is a bore.&quot; His rocky friendship with Tolstoy in 1861 wrought such animosity that Tolstoy challenged Turgenev to a duel, afterwards apologizing. The two did not speak for 17 years, but never broke family ties. Dostoyevsky parodies Turgenev in his novel &quot;The Devils&quot; (1872) through the character of the vain novelist Karmazinov, who is anxious to ingratiate himself with the radical youth. However, in 1880, Dostoevsky&#x27;s Pushkin Speech at the unveiling of the Alexander Pushkin monument brought about a reconciliation of sorts with Turgenev, who, like many in the audience, was moved to tears by his rival&#x27;s eloquent tribute to the Russian spirit.

Turgenev occasionally visited England, and in 1879 the honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law was conferred upon him by the University of Oxford.

Turgenev&#x27;s health declined during his later years. In January 1883, an aggressive malignant tumor (liposarcoma) was removed from his suprapubic region, but by then the tumor had metastasized in his upper spinal cord, causing him intense pain during the final months of his life. On 3 September 1883, Turgenev died of a spinal abscess, a complication of the metastatic liposarcoma, in his house at Bougival near Paris. His remains were taken to Russia and buried in Volkovo Cemetery in St. Petersburg. On his deathbed, he pleaded with Tolstoy: &quot;My friend, return to literature!&quot; After this, Tolstoy wrote such works as &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot; and &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot;.

Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s brain was found to be one of the largest on record, weighing .

== Work ==
Turgenev first made his name with &quot;A Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches&quot; (&quot;Записки охотника&quot;), also known as &quot;Sketches from a Hunter&#x27;s Album&quot; or &quot;Notes of a Hunter&quot; or &quot;Memoirs of a Hunter&quot;, a collection of short stories, based on his observations of peasant life and nature, while hunting in the forests around his mother&#x27;s estate of Spasskoye. Most of the stories were published in a single volume in 1852, with others being added in later editions. The book is credited with having influenced public opinion in favour of the abolition of serfdom in 1861. Turgenev himself considered the book to be his most important contribution to Russian literature; it is reported that &quot;Pravda&quot;, and Tolstoy, among others, agreed wholeheartedly, adding that Turgenev&#x27;s evocations of nature in these stories were unsurpassed. One of the stories in &quot;A Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches&quot;, known as &quot;Bezhin Lea&quot; or &quot;Byezhin Prairie&quot;, was later to become the basis for the controversial film &quot;Bezhin Meadow&quot; (1937), directed by Sergei Eisenstein.

In 1852, when his first major novels of Russian society were still to come, Turgenev wrote an obituary for Nikolai Gogol, intended for publication in the &quot;Saint Petersburg Gazette&quot;. The key passage reads: &quot;Gogol is dead!... What Russian heart is not shaken by those three words?... He is gone, that man whom we now have the right (the bitter right, given to us by death) to call great.&quot; The censor of Saint Petersburg did not approve of this and banned publication, but the Moscow censor allowed it to be published in a newspaper in that city. The censor was dismissed; but Turgenev was held responsible for the incident, imprisoned for a month, and then exiled to his country estate for nearly two years. It was during this time that Turgenev wrote his short story &quot;Mumu&quot; (&quot;Муму&quot;) in 1854. The story tells a tale of a deaf and mute peasant who is forced to drown the only thing in the world which brings him happiness, his dog Mumu. Like his &quot;A Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches&quot; (&quot;Записки охотника&quot;), this work takes aim at the cruelties of a serf society. This work was later applauded by John Galsworthy who claimed, &quot;no more stirring protest against tyrannical cruelty was ever penned in terms of art.&quot;

While he was still in Russia in the early 1850s, Turgenev wrote several novellas (&quot;povesti&quot; in Russian): &quot;The Diary of a Superfluous Man&quot; (&quot;Дневник лишнего человека&quot;), &quot;Faust&quot; (&quot;Фауст&quot;), &quot;The Lull&quot; (&quot;Затишье&quot;), expressing the anxieties and hopes of Russians of his generation.

In the 1840s and early 1850s, during the rule of Tsar Nicholas I, the political climate in Russia was stifling for many writers. This is evident in the despair and subsequent death of Gogol, and the oppression, persecution, and arrests of artists, scientists, and writers. During this time, thousands of Russian intellectuals, members of the &quot;intelligentsia&quot;, emigrated to Europe. Among them were Alexander Herzen and Turgenev himself, who moved to Western Europe in 1854, although this decision probably had more to do with his fateful love for Pauline Viardot than anything else.

The following years produced the novel &quot;Rudin&quot; (&quot;Рудин&quot;), the story of a man in his thirties who is unable to put his talents and idealism to any use in the Russia of Nicholas I. &quot;Rudin&quot; is also full of nostalgia for the idealistic student circles of the 1840s.

Following the thoughts of the influential critic Vissarion Belinsky, Turgenev abandoned Romantic idealism for a more realistic style. Belinsky defended sociological realism in literature; Turgenev portrayed him in &quot;Yakov Pasinkov&quot; (1855). During the period of 1853–62 Turgenev wrote some of his finest stories as well as the first four of his novels: &quot;Rudin&quot; (&quot;Рудин&quot;) (1856), &quot;A Nest of the Gentry&quot; (&quot;Дворянское гнездо&quot;) (1859), &quot;On the Eve&quot; (&quot;Накануне&quot;) (1860) and &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; (&quot;Отцы и дети&quot;) (1862). Some themes involved in these works include the beauty of early love, failure to reach one&#x27;s dreams, and frustrated love. Great influences on these works are derived from his love of Pauline and his experiences with his mother, who controlled over 500 serfs with the same strict demeanor in which she raised him.

In 1858 Turgenev wrote the novel &quot;A Nest of the Gentry&quot; (&quot;Дворянское гнездо&quot;), also full of nostalgia for the irretrievable past and of love for the Russian countryside. It contains one of his most memorable female characters, Liza, whom Dostoyevsky paid tribute to in his Pushkin speech of 1880, alongside Tatiana and Tolstoy&#x27;s Natasha Rostova.

Alexander II ascended the Russian throne in 1855, and the political climate became more relaxed. In 1859, inspired by reports of positive social changes, Turgenev wrote the novel &quot;On the Eve&quot; (&quot;Накануне&quot;) (published 1860), portraying the Bulgarian revolutionary Insarov.

The following year saw the publication of one of his finest novellas, &quot;First Love&quot; (&quot;Первая любовь&quot;), which was based on bitter-sweet childhood memories, and the delivery of his speech (&quot;Hamlet and Don Quixote&quot;, at a public reading in Saint Petersburg) in aid of writers and scholars suffering hardship. The vision presented therein of man torn between the self-centered skepticism of Hamlet and the idealistic generosity of Don Quixote is one that can be said to pervade Turgenev&#x27;s own works. It is worth noting that Dostoyevsky, who had just returned from exile in Siberia, was present at this speech, for eight years later he was to write &quot;The Idiot&quot;, a novel whose tragic hero, Prince Myshkin, resembles Don Quixote in many respects. Turgenev, whose knowledge of Spanish, thanks to his contact with Pauline Viardot and her family, was good enough for him to have considered translating Cervantes&#x27;s novel into Russian, played an important role in introducing this immortal figure of world literature into the Russian context.

&quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; (&quot;Отцы и дети&quot;), Turgenev&#x27;s most famous and enduring novel, appeared in 1862. Its leading character, Eugene Bazarov, considered the &quot;first Bolshevik&quot; in Russian literature, was in turn heralded and reviled as either a glorification or a parody of the &#x27;new men&#x27; of the 1860s. The novel examined the conflict between the older generation, reluctant to accept reforms, and the nihilistic youth. In the central character, Bazarov, Turgenev drew a classical portrait of the mid-nineteenth-century nihilist. &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; was set during the six-year period of social ferment, from Russia&#x27;s defeat in the Crimean War to the Emancipation of the Serfs. Hostile reaction to &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; (&quot;Отцы и дети&quot;) prompted Turgenev&#x27;s decision to leave Russia. As a consequence he also lost the majority of his readers. Many radical critics at the time (with the notable exception of Dimitri Pisarev) did not take &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; seriously; and, after the relative critical failure of his masterpiece, Turgenev was disillusioned and started to write less.

Turgenev&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Smoke&quot; (&quot;Дым&quot;), was published in 1867 and was again received less than enthusiastically in his native country, as well as triggering a quarrel with Dostoyevsky in Baden-Baden.

His last substantial work attempting to do justice to the problems of contemporary Russian society, &quot;Virgin Soil&quot; (&quot;Новь&quot;), was published in 1877.

Stories of a more personal nature, such as &quot;Torrents of Spring&quot; (&quot;Вешние воды&quot;), &quot;King Lear of the Steppes&quot; (&quot;Степной король Лир&quot;), and &quot;The Song of Triumphant Love&quot; (&quot;Песнь торжествующей любви&quot;), were also written in these autumnal years of his life. Other last works included the &quot;Poems in Prose&quot; and &quot;Clara Milich&quot; (&quot;After Death&quot;), which appeared in the journal &quot;European Messenger&quot;.
 Turgenev wrote on themes similar to those found in the works of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, but he did not approve of the religious and moral preoccupations that his two great contemporaries brought to their artistic creation. Turgenev was closer in temperament to his friends Gustave Flaubert and Theodor Storm, the North German poet and master of the novella form, who also often dwelt on memories of the past and evoked the beauty of nature.

== Legacy ==

Turgenev&#x27;s artistic purity made him a favorite of like-minded novelists of the next generation, such as Henry James and Joseph Conrad, both of whom greatly preferred Turgenev to Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. James, who wrote no fewer than five critical essays on Turgenev&#x27;s work, claimed that &quot;his merit of form is of the first order&quot; (1873) and praised his &quot;exquisite delicacy&quot;, which &quot;makes too many of his rivals appear to hold us, in comparison, by violent means, and introduce us, in comparison, to vulgar things&quot; (1896). Vladimir Nabokov, notorious for his casual dismissal of many great writers, praised Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;plastic musical flowing prose&quot;, but criticized his &quot;labored epilogues&quot; and &quot;banal handling of plots&quot;. Nabokov stated that Turgenev &quot;is not a great writer, though a pleasant one&quot;, and ranked him fourth among nineteenth-century Russian prose writers, behind Tolstoy, Gogol, and Anton Chekhov, but ahead of Dostoyevsky. His idealistic ideas about love, specifically the devotion a wife should show her husband, were cynically referred to by characters in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;An Anonymous Story&quot;. Isaiah Berlin acclaimed Turgenev&#x27;s commitment to humanism, pluralism, and gradual reform over violent revolution as representing the best aspects of Russian liberalism.

== Antisemitism ==
Turgenev was known for his pejorative descriptions of Jews, for example in his story &quot;The Jew&quot; (1847). (The story&#x27;s title in Russian, &quot;жид&quot; (zhyd), is a pejorative.) The story describes a &quot;zhyd&quot; named Girshel as short and thin, with red hair, reddish eyes that he blinks constantly, and a long and crooked nose. He pursues his greed to the point of prostituting his daughter and is quoted as saying that &quot;money is a good thing, you can get anything with it&quot;. Girschel is described as heartbroken, and in the description of his trial on charges of espionage, he is sentenced to death. Turgenev describes him as shaking with his whole body, shouting and meowing, &quot;until he involuntarily brought a smile to our faces.&quot; In a similar way, the beating of another Jew and the attempt to kill him is described as being met with laughter from the audience.

<doc id="180915" wikidata="Q835706" url="?curid=180915" title="Prince of Asturias">
<text>Prince or Princess of Asturias () is the main substantive title used by the heir apparent, or heir presumptive to the Spanish Crown. According to the Spanish Constitution of 1978:

The title originated in 1388, when King John I of Castile granted the dignitywhich included jurisdiction over the territory of Asturias – to his first-born son Henry. In an attempt to end the dynastic struggle between the heirs of Kings Peter I and Henry II of Castile, the principality was chosen as the highest jurisdictional lordship the King could grant that had not yet been granted to anyone. The custom of granting unique titles to royal heirs had already been in use in the Crown of Aragon (Prince of Girona) and the kingdoms of England (Prince of Wales), and France (Dauphin of Viennois). The title, therefore, had two purposes: to serve as a generic title to name the heir apparent or heir presumptive, and as a specific title to apply to the prince who was first in the line of succession when the King transmitted to him the territory of the principality, with its government and its income.

After the formation of the dynastic union between the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon under the Catholic Monarchs, the title was favoured by the Spanish King, who by custom applied it in the same way, i.e. to his heir apparent. For generations the kingdom&#x27;s crown prince accumulated the titles &quot;Prince of Asturias, Girona, Spain and the New World&quot;, modifying those of the earlier regnant Habsburgs: &quot;Prince of these Kingdoms, Prince of the Spains and the New World&quot; (&quot;Príncipe de estos Reynos, príncipe de las Españas y del Nuevo Mundo&quot;).

When the Bourbons acceded to the Spanish throne in 1705, the title was retained following the decisive help of Castile to the house in the War of the Spanish Succession. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Spanish Constitution of 1812 (European year of revolutions) with consent of its counterparties ascribed the title to the heir of the Crown. The Constitutions within the following decades temporarily removed the synonymy between the title and position as heir to the Crown; before being reinstated and recited in the second half of the 19th century, first half of the 20th century, and on the restoration of the monarchy (under parliamentary predominance) in 1978.

==History ==

The jurisdictional lordships, forms of governmentnot of ownership or possession, which were consolidated in the 14th and 15th centurieswere subrogations of the royal power for the administration of towns, usually those with geographical or structural difficulties that generated income. From King Alfonso XI the rulers created these lordships to give to their allies a proper way to maintain their position and to be able to govern and administer areas that were otherwise difficult to take care of with the traditional channels of the monarchy. From its origins, there have been buying and selling operations.

===Origins: Counties of Noreña and Gijón===

The origins of the Principality of Asturias can be traced to the counties of Noreña and Gijónlocated in the ancient Asturias de Oviedoterritories with seignorial jurisdiction that belonged to Rodrigo Álvarez, who was called &quot;of the Asturias&quot;. These lordships were unique: they were territories that in remote times formed the Kingdom of Asturias, the one identified with the origins of the monarchy.

When Rodrigo died without an heir in 1333, he bequeathed his domains to Henry, Count of Trastámara and illegitimate half-brother of King Peter I, during whose reign a &quot;true civil war&quot;in the words of Luis Suárez Fernándeztook place in Asturias de Oviedo because a group of knights settled in small dominions believed that the consolidation of the &quot;states&quot; that were being occupied by the Count of Trastámara (in a civil war against the King), would affect their power. Henry, once King, ceded the counties to his illegitimate son Alfonso Enríquez. During the reign of his half brother King John I, the Count of Noreña and Gijón revolted against him several times; for this reason, the King decided to confiscate the counties and incorporate them to the Crown, promising in a document dated 18July 1383 that they would always remain part of the royal demesne.

===Creation of the Principality===

After the assassination of King Peter I in 1369, there began a series of disputes and long rivalries between John, Duke of Lancaster (who claimed the Castilian throne as the husband of Constance, eldest surviving daughter of King PeterI and his mistress María de Padilla but recognized as legitimate and in line of succession by the Cortes of 1362), and the two successive Trastámara claimants, HenryII and his son JohnI. After two decades of conflicts of varying intensity, the parties arrived at a compromise through means of the marriage between Prince Henry (son and heir of King JohnI) and Catherine of Lancaster (only surviving child of John and Constance). 

On 8 July 1388 the Treaty of Bayonne was signed between John of Lancaster and King JohnI of Castile, establishing the final dynastic reconciliation after the assassination of King PeterI. By this treaty, the Duke of Lancaster and his wife Constance renounced all their rights over the Castilian throne on behalf of the marriage of their daughter Catherine to the first-born son of King JuanI of Castile, the future HenryIII, who was granted as heir the dignity of Prince of Asturias. The title was granted with a ceremony.

The premature death of John I and the minority of HenryIII prevented the institutional and juridical conformation of the principality while Alfonso Enríquez rebelled again after obtaining his freedom by royal decree. Besieged by the King&#x27;s troops, he submitted to the arbitration of King Charles VI of France, who imposed on the count the return of the territories he held in Asturias. The territory was subdued, and his royal status was confirmed.

In the early days of its creation, the title of Prince of Asturias was not just a simple honorific title, as it included control of the territory of Asturias. The Prince ruled it in representation of the King and was able to appoint judges, mayors, etc. King JohnII by decree dated in Tordesillas on 3March 1444 declared the conversion of the principality into a jurisdictional lordship, linking the cities, towns, and places of Asturias deOviedo with their rents and jurisdictions to the Majorat of the heirs of the Crown; however, this document was in some case disobeyed and ignored by the Asturian towns as it went against their traditional &quot;fueros&quot;. On 31May of that same year the future HenryIV tried to make the Majorat effective and remember Oviedo and the twenty-one principal Asturian villages that rightfully belonged to his lordship even though he had not &quot;executed or used [the principality] because of my minority and the great debates and scandals that have taken place in these kingdoms&quot;.

With the legal conformation, the duality principality–lordship was recovered and would last under the jurisdiction of the Prince until the time of Catholic Monarchs, who limited the scope of the title, making it merely honorary; this decision was upheld by the members of the House of Habsburg and the House of Bourbon until the present day.

Although all the heirs of the Crown of Castile have traditionally been considered Princes of Asturias, not all had a formal act by which the jurisdictional lordship was granted; strictly speaking, the only Princes of Asturias were Henry, during 1388–1390, Enrique, during 1444–1453, Isabella during 1468–1474, and John, briefly during 1496–1497. In the periods in which no prince was proclaimed, the Principality did not disappear but was directly governed by the monarch, to whose treasury were sent the jurisdictional rents.

With the Catholic Monarchs, there began a policy of reintegration of the royal patrimony that gave rise to a long fight with the principality, lasting from 1483 to 1490, with the signing of an agreement by which the House of Quiñones handed over to the Crown the districts of Cangas, Tineo, Llanes, and Ribadesella in exchange for five million maravedis and the Leonese Babias. In 1496 there was an attempt to revive the principality by Royal Letter dated 20May, in which the monarchs, &quot;wishing to observe the ancient custom&quot; of their Kingdomsan allusion to Aragongave to Prince John the rents and jurisdictions of the Asturian places that had previously reverted to the Crown, reserving to them the majority of the judges and the condition of not alienating his patrimony.

===Decadence under the Habsburgs===

With Prince John the title was added to a list of titles used by the Hispanic monarchy, the heir adding the titles of Prince of Asturias, Girona (1496), Spain, and the New World. The imperialist aspirations are observed in the new title of the heir of the Catholic Monarchs: &quot;Prince of these Kingdoms, Prince of the Spains and the New World&quot; (&quot;Príncipe de estos Reynos, Príncipe de las Españas y del Nuevo Mundo&quot;). The title lives from that moment a time of partial decadence with the establishment of the House of Habsburg on the Spanish throne; for example, PhilipII was educated to take on the functions of Regent during the absences of his father, not like a Prince of Asturias. The 16th and 17th centuries were characterized by various conflicts between the King and the principality because of the titles and dignities granted and referring to the territory. Only during the reign of PhilipIV was a proper ceremony introduced for the Prince&#x27;s oath as heir.

===Absolutism under the Bourbons===

With the arrival of the House of Bourbon to the Spanish throne after the War of the Spanish Succession begins a new period for the Principality of Asturias, whose population looked upon the new dynasty with hope. The new royal house promoted an identification of the Principality with the Spanish heir following the aid given by the Crown of Castile during the war, and the Principality of Asturias, which until then had been held by the heir of Castile, tended to be considered properly Spanish.

===19th century Constitutions===

Another period for the title began at the beginning of the 19th century with the arrival of the constitutional regime. For Agustín Argüelles, an Asturian deputy in the Cortes of Cádiz, the draft of the Constitution of 1812 preserved more by &quot;custom than by utility or precision&quot; the title of Prince of Asturias to the heir of the Crown. The commission responsible for the writing of the new constitution, equating the Crown Prince with the Prince of Asturias, proposed that the Cortes should recognize him immediately after announcing his birth and that upon reaching the age of 14, the prince should swear before the Cortes the defence of the Catholic faith, the preservation of the Constitution, and obedience to the King. During discussions, some deputies proposed that the Prince should be renamed &quot;of the Spains&quot; and not &quot;of Asturias&quot;, while others wanted him to use the dignity only after his oath and not from his birth. Besides Argüelles, the Asturians Pedro Inguanzo Rivero and Alonso Cañedo Vigil, each with opposing ideologies, defended, respectively, a title of honor or a title that was purely nominal, without royal rights but consecrated by history. The project remained unchanged and was finally approved.

The synonymy of the title &quot;Prince of Asturias&quot; with the heir of the throne was eliminated in the constitutions of 1837 and 1845, instead referring to the &quot;immediate heir to the crown&quot; (Article20 of the Constitution of 1837) and &quot;immediate successor to the Crown&quot;, &quot; immediate successor, &quot;and&quot; first-born son of the King &quot; (articles 39, 47, and 61 of the Constitution of 1845).

The royal decree of 30May 1850 attributes to the &quot;immediate successors to the Crown&quot;, according to the Constitution of the Monarchy, without distinction of men or women,&quot; the continued use of &quot;Prince of Asturias&quot;. Queen Isabella II gave birth to a daughter, Isabella, on 20 December 1851 and as a result of this decree, the newborn received the title of &quot;Princess of Asturias&quot;. Isabella would lose this title with the birth of her brother, the future Alfonso XII, in 1857.

The Constitution of 1869 kept the traditional denomination of Prince of Asturias due to the influence of the Asturian politician José Posada Herrera. Alfonso XII ascended the throne in 1874 following the end of the brief First Spanish Republic and as the infanta Isabella was the immediate heir to the Crown after her brother Alfonso, she once again became &quot;Princess of Asturias&quot; by royal order of 25March 1875, applying the doctrine of 1850 by granting the title of Princess without distinguishing between male or female successor. The subsequent Constitution of 1876 omitted the title again from its provisions, similar to the constitutions of 1837 and 1845.

Alfonso&#x27;s wife, Maria Christina of Austria, was expecting a child with many hoping for a male heir. A new decree dated 1August 1880, established the ceremony for the presentation of the &quot;Prince or Infanta&quot; as Maria Christina was close to giving birth; the decision to formally establish the title was immediately appealed by a commission of the Provincial Delegation of Oviedo, which asked for the return of the title based on the validity of the decree of 1850. The decree establishing the ceremony for the presentation of the child was published in the &quot;Gazette of Madrid&quot; of 1September 1880, in which the heir was referred to as Prince of Asturias.

The royal decree of 22 August 1880 tried to clarify all the confusion and established the titles and honors of the Prince and Infantes. It was preceded by a statement of reasons in which the head of government Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, who was also a historian, sought to establish the true profile of the institution, arguing that there was an &quot;unnecessary and inaccurate&quot; confusion between the right of succession and the title of Prince of Asturias, that the Castilian investiture of the Principality of Asturias should not be confused with the succession to the Spanish Crown, that the single denomination of &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;Prince of these Kingdoms&quot; be reserved, and that the legislators of Cádiz had exceeded their functions, sowing confusion in the constitutional articles. The decree established that the title had not been a creation of the Cortes, but of the King&#x27;s will, and restored the &quot;secular uses&quot;, maintaining the title of Prince for the first-born sons of the monarch, using the denomination of &quot;Asturias&quot;. The decree stated that any other immediate successor, male or female, had to be granted the title.

Maria Christina gave birth to a girl on 11 September 1880, to much disappointment, and the infant was initially treated only as an infanta. Cánovas, who wanted the crown to pass to a male, ignored the baby. After considerable criticism, the new liberal government of Práxedes Mateo Sagasta was limited to restoring the principles of the decree of 1850, granting the title of Princess of Asturias to Infanta María de las Mercedes in a royal decree dated 10March 1881.

===Current democracy===

With the restoration of the monarchy in 1975, the Royal Decree of 21January 1977, supported by the Provincial Delegation of Oviedo, ordered that the son of King Juan Carlos I, Prince Felipe, bear the title of Prince of Asturias, in addition to those titles traditionally appertaining to the heir of the throne. The process culminated in the promulgation of the Constitution of 1978, whose article57 says that the Crown Prince will be Prince of Asturias and can use the other titles linked to his person, symbolically embodying the Spanish dynastic union.

The Prince of Asturias, as crown prince, is the first in the Line of succession to the Spanish throne, receives the treatment of Royal Highness by Royal Decree 1368/1987 and holds the titles inherent to that position, recognized in the article57.1 of the Constitution, and which symbolize the Spanish dynastic union. In addition to the principal of Prince of Asturias (as heir of the Crown of Castile), the heir also has the following titles:

* Prince of Girona, Duke of Montblanc, Count of Cervera, and Lord of Balaguer as the heir of the Crown of Aragon, with origins in 1351, 1387, 1353, and 1418, respectively.
* Prince of Viana, as the heir of Kingdom of Navarre, with origin in 1424.

He also presides over the Princess of Asturias and Princess de Girona Foundations, named Prince of Asturias and Prince of Girona when the heir is male.

Upon reaching the age of majority, she or he must take an oath before the to faithfully carry out her duties, to keep and enforce the Constitution and laws, and to respect the rights of citizens and autonomous communities, as well as show fidelity to the King, according to Article61 of the constitution. This procedure was introduced in 1978 since, before the promulgation of this constitution, the Princes of Asturias had to receive the oath of allegiance from the Cortes. The current titular of the Principality is Leonor, who took that dignity on 19June 2014, when her father, King Felipe VI, ascended to the throne following the abdication of her grandfather Juan Carlos I.

Following is a list of the princes of Asturias from the creation of the title in 1388, as dignity of the heir of the Crown of Castile, until today, when it has been incorporated to the set of titles historically linked to the crown prince of Spain as the main one of them:

<doc id="180916" wikidata="Q8111" url="?curid=180916" title="1908 Summer Olympics">
<text>The 1908 Summer Olympics (officially the Games of the IV Olympiad and also known as London 1908) were an international multi-sport event held in London, England, from 27 April to 31 October 1908. The 1908 Games were originally scheduled to be held in Rome, but were relocated on financial grounds following the violent eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906, which claimed over 100 lives; Rome eventually hosted the Games in 1960. 

These were the fourth chronological modern Summer Olympics in keeping with the now-accepted four-year cycle as opposed to the alternate four-year cycle of the proposed Intercalated Games. The IOC president for these Games was Baron Pierre de Coubertin. 

Lasting a total of 187 days (six months and four days), these were the longest Games in modern Olympics history.

== Background ==
There were four bids for the 1908 Summer Olympics. Rome was selected ahead of London, Berlin and Milan. The selection was made at the 6th IOC Session in London in 1904.

Italian authorities were preparing to stage the games when Mount Vesuvius erupted on 7 April 1906, devastating the city of Naples. Funds were diverted to the reconstruction of Naples, so a new host country was required. London was selected for the first time to hold the Games, which were held at White City alongside the Franco-British Exhibition, at the time the more noteworthy event.

The White City Stadium, built in short time for the Games, held 68,000 people, with full crowds turning up to watch the events. The stadium track was three laps to the mile (536.448 metres per lap), as the current standard of 400 metres did not exist until 1962, with a pool (for swimming and diving events) and platforms (for wrestling and gymnastics) in the centre field.

The distance from the start of the marathon to the finish at the stadium was established at these Games: the original distance of 25 miles was changed to 26 miles so the marathon could start at Windsor Castle and then changed again at the request of Princess Mary so the start would be beneath the windows of the Royal Nursery. To ensure that the race would finish in front of the King, the finish line was moved by British officials who &quot;felt compelled to restore the importance of the monarchy.&quot; As a result of these changes, the marathon covered a distance of 26 miles and 385 yards (42.195 km), which became the standard length starting with the 1924 Summer Olympics.

== The Games ==
There were controversies at the games. On the opening day, following the practice introduced at the Intercalated Games of 1906, teams paraded behind national flags. However, the arrangement caused complications:

* Since Finland was part of the Russian Empire, members of the Finnish team were expected to march under the Russian rather than Finnish flag, so many chose to march without a flag at all.
* The Swedish flag had not been displayed above the stadium, so the members of the Swedish team decided not to take part in the ceremony.
* The United States&#x27; flag bearer, Ralph Rose, refused to dip the flag to King-Emperor Edward VII in the royal box. His fellow athlete Martin Sheridan allegedly declared that &quot;this flag dips to no earthly King.&quot; The quote is held as an example of Irish and American defiance of the British monarchy, though its historicity is disputed.

=== Events ===
The 1908 Olympics also prompted establishment of standard rules for sports, and selection of judges from different countries rather than just the host. One reason was the 400 metre race, in which a US runner, John Carpenter, was accused by the British officials of interfering with a British runner. Part of the problem was the different definition of interference under British and international rules (the events were held under British rules by the decision of the Organising Committee). The officials decided to disqualify Carpenter and ordered a second final race without him. British Halswelle was to face the other two finalists. These athletes, William Robbins and John Taylor, were both Americans and decided not to participate in the repeat of the final to protest against the judges&#x27; decision. Halswelle was thus the only medallist in the 400 metres.


The most famous incident of the games came at the end of the marathon. Dorando Pietri, Italy, began his race at a rather slow pace, but in the second half of the course began a powerful surge moving him into second position by the mark, 4 minutes behind South African Charles Hefferon. When he knew that Hefferon was in crisis, Pietri further increased his pace, overtaking him at the mark.

The effort took its toll and with only two kilometres to go, Pietri began to feel the effects of extreme fatigue and dehydration. When he entered the stadium, he took the wrong path and when umpires redirected him, he fell down for the first time. He got up with their help, in front of 75,000 spectators.

He fell four more times, and each time the umpires helped him up. In the end, though totally exhausted, he managed to finish the race in first place. Of his total time of 2h 54min 46s, ten minutes were needed for that last 340 metres. Second was American Johnny Hayes. The American team immediately lodged a complaint against the help Pietri received from the umpires. The complaint was accepted and Pietri was disqualified and removed from the final standings of the race. Since he had not been responsible for his disqualification, Queen Alexandra awarded him a gilded silver cup the next day.

These Games were the first to include winter events, as had originally been proposed for the Games. There were four figure skating events, although held on 28 and 29 October, months after most of the other events.

Oscar Swahn from Sweden, who won the gold medal for running deer shooting, became the oldest Olympic champion of all time, and set another age record by being 72 years and 279 days old during his triumph at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. One of the more unusual shooting events in 1908 was Olympic dueling. The discipline, which was an associate event (that is, not official), was performed by facing opponents wearing protective clothing and masks and firing wax bullets.

American John Taylor was a member of the winning medley relay team, making him the first African-American athlete to win an Olympic gold medal. Times for the winning team were United States (3:29.4): William Hamilton, 200 metres (22.0); Nathaniel Cartmell, 200 metres (22.2); John Taylor, 400 metres (49.8); and Melvin Sheppard, 800 metres (1:55.4). Less than five months after returning from the Olympic Games in London, Taylor died of typhoid fever on 2 December 1908 at the age of 26.

The budget of the organising committee showed a cost of £15,000; over one-third was labelled &quot;entertainment expense&quot;. Donations were the major source of revenue; only 28% of income derived from ticket sales. Total receipts of £21,378 resulted in organisers claiming a profit. Construction of the White City Stadium, which cost the government about £60,000, was not counted.

== Sports ==
Twenty-two sports, representing 110 events in 25 sporting disciplines, were contested. A golf tournament had also been planned but it was cancelled a few days before it was scheduled to start. Swimming, diving, and water polo are considered three disciplines of the same sport, &quot;aquatics&quot;. At the time, tug-of-war was part of athletics and the two different football codes (association and rugby (union)) were listed together. The International Olympic Committee now considers tug-of-war a separate sport as well as referring to association football as simply &quot;football&quot; and to rugby union as &quot;rugby.&quot; In one of seven cycling events (cycling sprint) no medals were awarded. The sailing program was open for a total of five sailing classes, but actually only four sailing events were contested. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.

Cycle polo, glima and pistol dueling were demonstration sports.

== Venues ==


Thirteen sports venues were used for the 1908 Summer Olympics. The first winter sports took place at Prince&#x27;s Skating Club in Knightsbridge. White City Stadium served as a precursor to modern stadiums. The figure skating events were not held at the next Olympics in Stockholm, but returned for the 1920 Games in Antwerp, heralding the first Winter Olympics that took place in Chamonix in 1924. White City was the main venue for the 1934 British Empire Games (known as the Commonwealth Games since 1978) and, before its demolition in 1985, also served as a venue for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The All England Lawn Tennis Club continues to host the Wimbledon championships and is the only venue of the 1908 Games that was used for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Bisley and Henley served as venues in the 1948 Games when the Olympics returned to London forty years later.

== Participating nations ==

The 1908 Games featured athletes representing 22 National Olympic Committees. Finland, Turkey and New Zealand (as part of the team from Australasia) made their first appearance at the Olympic Games. The fact that the United Kingdom competed as a single team was upsetting to some Irish competitors, who felt that Ireland should compete on its own, despite being part of the UK at the time. They relied on the precedent set by Grand Duchy of Finland, which while being a part of the Russian Empire, competed in London as a separate country. Fearing an Irish boycott, the authorities changed the name of the team to Great Britain/Ireland, and in two sports, field hockey and polo, Ireland participated as a separate country, winning silver medals in both, although their medals counted towards the UK&#x27;s tally. Irish athletes in the United States were not affected by this controversy, and many Irish immigrants to the United States competed for the U.S. Olympic team as members of the Irish American Athletic Club. Members of the Irish American Athletic Club won ten of the U.S. Olympic team&#x27;s total 23 gold medals, or as many as the nations of France, Germany and Italy combined.

Britain had more than a quarter of competitors in their team, with 676, compared to 112 on the American team which placed second in the medal standings.

<doc id="180917" wikidata="Q1857747" url="?curid=180917" title="Valiant Is the Word for Carrie">
<text>Valiant Is the Word for Carrie is a 1936 American drama film directed by Wesley Ruggles and written by Claude Binyon, based on the 1935 novel of the same name by Barry Benefield. The film stars Gladys George, Arline Judge, John Howard, Dudley Digges, Harry Carey, and Isabel Jewell.

&quot;Valiant Is the Word for Carrie&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on October 2, 1936, by Paramount Pictures. The film earned George her first and only Academy Award nomination in her career for her portrayal of the title character.

==Plot==
Carrie Snyder (Gladys George) is a prostitute who is forced out of the fictional southern town of Crebillon after forming a friendship with a young boy named Paul (Jackie Moran), whose dying mother (Janet Young) is unable to stop her son from visiting such a woman. After Carrie leaves town, Paul runs away from his abusive father (John Wray) and meets a girl named Lady (Charlene Wyatt) who has run away from a burning trainwreck, not wanting to go back to the people she was with. Carrie comes back for Paul and ends up taking Paul and Lady to New York with her. Carrie gets an apartment and starts a successful chain of laundry stores. Eventually they become rich and Lady (Arline Judge) becomes attracted to Paul (John Howard). Paul, however, feels obligated to take care of a young woman named Lili (Isabel Jewell) whose brother&#x27;s death he caused (the brother had been pushing Paul to try to get on the train, but when Paul pushed back, the train door closed with the brother on the outside with his coat stuck in the train door, causing him to get dragged along with the train and his legs to be run over). Lilli pretends to love Paul because he is rich, which Carrie is able to see, but which Paul does not. She devises a plan to make Lilli leave. She tells Lilli that if she will leave Paul, she will help get Lilli&#x27;s true love out of jail. They attempt to break the man out of jail, but are caught. Lilli is fatally shot and Carrie is sent to jail. An old lawyer friend (Harry Carey) vows to fight for her freedom, but Carrie decides to plead guilty because she doesn&#x27;t want Lady to know about her past as a prostitute. She also fears it would tarnish the reputation of the children. The lawyer ends by remarking to Paul&#x27;s employer (Dudley Digges) that &quot;valiant is the word for Carrie&quot;.

==Literary antecedents==
The film was preceded by two literary versions by Barry Benefield: a short story and later a novel based on it.

===Short story===
Benefield&#x27;s original short story, titled &quot;With Banners Blowing&quot;, was published in the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot;, and later appeared in two collections under the title &quot;Carrie Snyder&quot;.

The original story focused entirely on events in the (fictional) town of Crebillion, Louisiana. Carrie Snyder is 31 years old, lives in a cottage at the edge of town and maintains herself as a prostitute, having a circle of regular customers. She has plenty of free time to cultivate her beloved flower garden, and is content with this life. However, though rather fond of such customers as U.S. Marshall Phil Yonne, who behave &quot;like gentlemen&quot;, she has never felt love for anybody until the seven-year-old Paul comes in to ask for a drink of water.

Carrie becomes instantly and deeply attached to the clever, sensitive, warm-hearted boy who comes again and again on secret visits, deposits with her his box of &quot;treasures&quot; which his father tried to confiscate and lets her take care of wounded creatures which he found—a tomcat and an owl. The African-American taxi driver Lon is Carrie and Paul&#x27;s friend and confidant, keeping their secret. (Strangely for modern sensibilities, the word &quot;nigger&quot; is repeatedly used for this highly positive and sympathetic character, clearly without any hint of pejorative intent.)

Deeply jealous of Paul&#x27;s mother, who can have him every day, Carrie is aware that this friendship would not last, and that the town&#x27;s established society would cut it off once discovered. And so indeed it does come to pass, and even worse than Carrie feared. Hearing that Paul was severely beaten by his father, and witnessing him being chased and cruelly teased and hazed by a gang of other boys, Carrie realizes that for Paul&#x27;s sake she must leave the town, let her beloved garden deteriorate, and never come back. The original story ends poignantly with Carrie going into a self-imposed exile, with the clear implication that she would never see Paul again.

===Novel===
Barry Benefield later took up the story and made a revised version of it the first chapter of what became the 1936 novel &quot;Valiant Is the Word for Carrie&quot;.

Bar minor differences, the film&#x27;s plot, as described above, followed the novel&#x27;s plot up to the moment of the attempted jail break. From that point on, however, novel and film drastically diverge. In the original novel, the jailbreak succeeded without a hitch, and Lili and her lover were able to escape to Canada and start a new life there. Carrie returned unscathed to New York, her part in the jail break completely unknown. Later, Lady divorced the Baltimore millionaire Mat Burdon whom she married to spite Paul; Lady and Paul then married and lived happily ever after; and at the end of the novel Carrie, who managed to pull her laundry business through the slump of 1929, is prepared to play loving foster grandmother to their first child.

However, the germ of the film&#x27;s ending - with the jail break going wrong and Carrie being arrested and facing trial - is present in the novel as a conversation about &quot;what might have been&quot; and &quot;how things might have gone wrong&quot;.

==Reception==
Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;more moral and uplifting than &quot;Pollyanna&quot;&quot; and &quot;irresistibly attractive&quot;. He criticized the running time for being almost two hours. He concluded that &quot;The misfortune is that &#x27;valiant&#x27; is only one of the words for Carrie; another would be &#x27;disproportionate.&#x27; The picture takes too long, although doing it well, to introduce a little which is not well done at all.&quot;

==Cultural references==
In 1938, the Three Stooges made a short titled &quot;Violent Is the Word for Curly&quot;, a takeoff on the name of this then-popular film.

<doc id="180919" wikidata="Q9600" url="?curid=180919" title="1936 Winter Olympics">
<text>The 1936 Winter Olympics, officially known as the IV Olympic Winter Games () and commonly known as Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936, were a winter multi-sport event held from 6 to 16 February 1936 in the market town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. Germany also hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics, which were held in Berlin. It was the last year in which the Summer and Winter Games both took place in the same country (the cancelled 1940 Olympics would have been held in Japan, with Tokyo hosting the Summer Games and Sapporo hosting the Winter Games).

The 1936 Winter Games were organized on behalf of the German League of the Reich for Physical Exercise (DRL) by Karl Ritter von Halt, who had been named president of the committee for the organization of the Fourth Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen by &quot;Reichssportführer&quot; Hans von Tschammer und Osten.

==Organization and politics==
While the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin months later have attracted extensive examination for the Nazi Party&#x27;s spectacles and the accompanying racial controversies – including the exclusion of most Jewish athletes and Jesse Owens&#x27;s achievements – the Winter Games took place five months earlier and saw some of the same efforts by Adolf Hitler&#x27;s propaganda machine.

Globally, there had been efforts to initiate boycotts from different countries, and a number of Jewish athletes faced pressure not to participate in an event held in a nation ruled by a blatantly antisemitic regime.

The Nazis took steps to soften the appearance of their harsher policies before visitors from other nations arrived, such as removing antisemitic signage that was common in Germany, and – under pressure from a potential American boycott and Olympic officials – allowing the Jewish athlete Rudi Ball to play on Germany&#x27;s ice hockey team.

A few weeks before the Games began, William L. Shirer, the Berlin correspondent for the Universal wire service, wrote a series of articles describing preparations for the competition. &quot;I had written... that the Nazis at Garmisch had pulled down all the signs saying that Jews are unwanted (they&#x27;re all over Germany) and that the Olympic visitors would thus be spared any signs of the kind of treatment meted out to Jews in this country.&quot;

None of the member nations boycotted the Winter Games, and 49 in all participated, the greatest number at that time. The Games were completed with a minimum of political controversy, although the Canadian skiing team raised their arms in what appeared to be a Nazi salute as they entered the opening ceremonies. The German crowd erupted in applause at the salute, which was later explained as the &quot;Olympic Salute&quot; that was identical to the Nazi version but with the arm extended laterally instead of forward.

However, even Shirer was impressed by the effectiveness of the Nazis&#x27; efforts, writing:

Twelve days after the Games closed, Hitler sent German troops to remilitarize the Rhineland, his first territorial violation of the Treaty of Versailles and a critical test of European resolve to resist Germany&#x27;s military expansion. None of the Western powers lifted a finger and Europe&#x27;s first steps towards World War Two were taken.

<doc id="180920" wikidata="Q5019578" url="?curid=180920" title="Calf roping">
<text>Calf roping, also known as tie-down roping in the United States and Canada and rope and tie in Australia and New Zealand, is a rodeo event that features a calf and a rider mounted on a horse. The goal of this timed event is for the rider to catch the calf by throwing a loop of rope from a lariat around its neck, dismount from the horse, run to the calf, and restrain it by tying three legs together, in as short a time as possible. A variant on the sport, with fewer animal welfare controversies, is breakaway roping, where the calf is roped, but not tied.

==Origin==

The event derives from the duties of actual working cowboys, which often required catching and restraining calves for branding or medical treatment. Ranch hands took pride in the speed with which they could rope and tie calves which soon turned their work into informal contests.

==Modern event==
The calves are lined up in a row and moved through narrow runways leading to a chute with spring-loaded doors. When a calf enters the chute, a door is closed behind it and a lightweight rope, attached to a trip lever, is fastened around the calf&#x27;s neck. The lever holds a taut cord or &quot;barrier&quot; that runs across a large pen or &quot;box&quot; at one side of the calf chute, where the horse and rider wait. The barrier is used to ensure that the calf gets a head start. When the roper is ready, he or she calls for the calf, and the chute operator pulls a lever opening the chute doors and releasing the calf. The calf runs out in a straight line. When the calf reaches the end of the rope, that trips the lever, the rope falls off the calf, and the barrier for the horse is released, starting the clock and allowing horse and rider to chase the calf.

Timing is critical. From a standstill, a rider will put his horse into a gallop from the box shortly after the calf leaves the chute, so that the horse saves valuable seconds by being at near-full speed the moment the barrier releases. However, if the rider mistimes his cue to the horse and the horse breaks the barrier before it releases, a 10-second penalty will be added to his time. This is sometimes referred to as a &quot;Cowboy Speeding Ticket.&quot;

The rider must lasso the calf from horseback by throwing a loop of the lariat around the calf&#x27;s neck. Once the rope is around the calf&#x27;s neck, the roper signals the horse to stop quickly while he dismounts and runs to the calf. The calf must be stopped by the rope but cannot be thrown to the ground by the rope. If the calf falls, the roper loses seconds because he must allow the calf to get back on its feet. When the roper reaches the calf, he picks it up and flips it onto its side. Once the calf is on the ground, the roper ties three of the calf&#x27;s legs together with a short rope known as a tie-down rope or &quot;piggin&#x27; string&quot;. A half hitch knot is used, sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot;two wraps and a hooey&quot; or a &quot;wrap and a slap&quot;. The piggin&#x27; string is often carried between the roper&#x27;s teeth until he uses it. The horse is trained to assist the roper by slowly backing away from the calf to maintain a steady tension on the rope.

When the tie is complete, the roper throws his hands in the air to signal &quot;time&quot; and stop the clock. The roper then returns to his horse, mounts, and moves the horse forward to relax the tension on the rope. The timer waits for six seconds, during which the calf must stay tied before an official time is recorded. After the six seconds, two officials then tend to the calf by untying it and letting it exit the arena. Top professional calf ropers will rope and tie a calf in seven seconds. The world record is just over six seconds.

==Organizations and regulations==

The event is recognized by most rodeo organizations such as the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) and the International Professional Rodeo Association (IPRA). In the United States, there are two organizations that promote calf roping alone: the National Calf Ropers Association (NCRA) and Ultimate Calf Roping (UCR). Other timed rodeo events that use cattle include breakaway roping, where the rider ropes but does not throw the calf; steer wrestling; and team roping, which uses adult cattle.

In PRCA events, the calf must weigh between 220 and 280 pounds. Calves must be strong and healthy; sick or injured livestock cannot be used. According to the PRCA, &quot;Most calves do not compete more than a few dozen times in their lives because of weight and usage restrictions and the fact that calves grow so rapidly.&quot;

==Animal welfare issues==

There are concerns over the welfare of the calves used in professional rodeo, and the industry itself polices events closely, penalizing competitors who &quot;jerk down&quot; a calf with the rope or flip it over backwards. In 1994, a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by on-site independent veterinarians. Reviewing 33,991 animal runs, the injury rate was documented at 0.047%, or less than five-hundredths of one percent.

A study of rodeo animals in Australia found a similar injury rate. Basic injuries occurred at a rate of 0.072 percent, or one in 1405, with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036 percent, or one injury in every 2810 times the animal was used, and transport, yarding and competition were all included in the study.

A later PRCA survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of &quot;slack&quot; indicated 27 animals were injured, again approximately five-hundredths of 1 percent0.0004.

Animal rights proponents claim, however, that examples of injuries caused by calf roping include paralysis from spinal cord injuries, severed tracheas, as well as broken backs, necks, and legs. Tie-down calf roping is not permitted in the state of Rhode Island or in the city of Baltimore.

Tie-down calf roping is also not allowed in some localities in Australia, Brazil and Canada and banned nationally in the United Kingdom, Germany and The Netherlands.

The ASPCA, an animal rights organization, notes that practice sessions are often the occasion of more severe abuses than competitions.

A 2016 study indicated that the process of calf roping, including being herded in the arena and into the roping chutes, was stressful on the animals as evidenced by eye movement when roped and increases in blood cortisol, epinephrine and nor-epinephrine. Novice calves just herded into the chutes and across the arena also demonstrated stress responses, experiencing slightly higher stress than experienced ones. However, cortisol responses did not continue for long. The researchers hypothesized that professionals at the highest level were less stressful on the animals than inexperienced ropers.

<doc id="180921" wikidata="Q1138511" url="?curid=180921" title="Craig Breedlove">
<text>Norman Craig Breedlove Sr. (March 23, 1937 – April 4, 2023) was an American professional race car driver and a five-time world land speed record holder. He was the first person in history to reach , and , using several turbojet-powered vehicles, all named &quot;Spirit of America&quot;.

==Land vehicle speed records==
In 1962, he made his first attempt, in a freewheeling tricycle (ignoring FIA rules requiring four wheels, at least two driven; in the event, FIM happily accepted it) powered by a General Electric J47 turbojet engine. On August 5, 1963, this first &quot;Spirit&quot; made its first record attempt, using just 90% of available thrust to reach over the measured mile. The return pass, on 95% power, turned up a two-way average of . &quot;Spirit of America&quot; was so light on the ground that it did not even need to change tires afterward.

For 1964, Breedlove faced competition from Walt Arfons&#x27; &quot;Wingfoot Express&quot; (piloted by Tom Green), as well as from brother Art Arfons in his four-wheel, FIA-legal &quot;Green Monster&quot;. With more engine power, Breedlove upped the record to &quot;[w]ith almost insolent ease&quot;, then to , making him the first man to exceed . This pass was not without incident, however, for one of his drogue parachute&#x27;s shroud lines parted, and &quot;Spirit of America&quot; ran on for before hitting a telegraph pole and coming to rest in a lake. This record stood all of twelve days before &quot;Green Monster&quot; broke it, recording a two-run average of .

In response, Breedlove built an FIA-legal four-wheeler, &quot;Sonic I&quot;, powered by a J79 turbojet. November 2, 1965, Breedlove entered the FIA record book with a two-run average of . This lasted even less time than before, for &quot;Green Monster&quot; came back five days later at . On November 15, Breedlove responded with a record (after turning in an amazing return pass), which held until 1970. (It would be broken by Gary Gabelich&#x27;s &quot;Blue Flame&quot;, which reached .) To take the record back, Breedlove planned a supersonic rocket car, &quot;complete with ejector seat.&quot; Also in 1965, Breedlove&#x27;s wife, Lee Breedlove, took the seat in &quot;Sonic 1&quot;, making four passes and achieving , making her the fastest woman alive, and making them the fastest couple, which they remain. According to the author Rachel Kushner, Craig had talked Lee into taking the car out for a record attempt to monopolize the salt flats for the day and block one of his competitors from making a record attempt.

During 1968, Lynn Garrison, President of Craig Breedlove &amp; Associates, started to package a deal that saw Utah&#x27;s Governor, Calvin Rampton, provide a hangar facility for the construction of a supersonic car. Bill Lear, of Learjet fame, was to provide support, along with his friend Art Linkletter. Playboy magazine hoped to have the car painted black, with a white bunny on the rudder. TRW was supplying a lunar lander rocket motor. A change in public interest saw the concept shelved for some time. They also negotiated for the use of the late Donald Campbell&#x27;s wheel-driven &quot;Bluebird CN7&quot; record-breaker.

After a lengthy break from world records and making his name as a real estate agent, Breedlove began work on a new Spirit in 1992, eventually named &quot;Spirit of America Formula Shell LSRV&quot;. The vehicle is 44 ft. 10 in. long, 8 ft. 4 in. wide, and 5 ft. 10 in. high (13.67 m by 2.54 m by 1.78 m) and weighs , construction is on a steel tube or space frame with an aluminium skin body. The engine is the same as in the second Spirit, a J79, but it is modified to burn unleaded gasoline and generates a maximum thrust of 22,650 lbf (100.75 kN).

The second run of the vehicle on October 28, 1996, in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada, ended in a crash at around . Returning in 1997, the vehicle badly damaged the engine on an early run and when the British ThrustSSC managed over , the re-engined Spirit could do no better than . Breedlove believed the vehicle was capable of exceeding , but was never tested.

In late 2006, Breedlove sold the car to Steve Fossett, who planned to attempt the land speed record in 2007. Fossett died in a plane crash in 2007, and the car was put up for sale. Breedlove&#x27;s vehicle, renamed the &quot;Sonic Arrow&quot;, was rolled out on the Black Rock Desert for a photo opportunity on October 15, 2007. The car is now on permanent display in the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum.

==Endurance and speed records for AMC==

Breedlove was put on the payroll at American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1968 to prepare the automaker&#x27;s pony and high-performance cars, the Javelin and the AMX, for speed and endurance records.

In January 1968, one month before the official introduction of the AMX model, Breedlove, his wife Lee, and Ron Dykes, established fourteen United States Automobile Club (USAC) and Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) certified speed records for cars of any engine size, and 106 national and international speed and endurance records for cars with less than .

Two cars were prepared for the endurance speed runs on a five-mile banked track in Texas. The shattered records included a Class C AMX (the No. 2 Lee Breedlove car) with the standard AMC V8 engine (bored to 304 cubic inches) with a 4-speed manual transmission, achieving a 24-hour average of that was set by Craig and his wife Lee. New records in a Class B AMX (the No. 1 Craig Breedlove car) using the optional &quot;AMX&quot; V8 (397 cubic inches) with a 3-speed automatic transmission, that included a distance with a flying start at , as well as a over a distance from a standing start.

After the cars were displayed at the Chicago Auto Show in February 1968, Breedlove took the AMX to Bonneville. He established a USAC sanctioned record of as well as an unofficial run of over .

Later in the year, American Motors entered three similarly equipped Javelins with AMC V8 engines in the C/Production class at Bonneville. The racing class limits modifications to aerodynamics, but requires changes for safety and also allows engine modifications. The cars included Edelbrock cross-ram &quot;STR-11&quot; intake manifolds with two Holley carburetors, special cylinder heads that were modified by Joe Mondello (an engine builder who became known for Oldsmobile engines) as well as &quot;Doug&#x27;s&quot; exhaust manifolds, and &quot;Crower&quot; camshafts. During November 1968, the &quot;Speed Spectacular Javelin&quot; run by Breedlove was the fastest, reaching establishing a speed record that stood for several years.

== Death ==
Breedlove died on April 4, 2023, at the age of 86, at home in Rio Vista, California. The cause of death was cancer, his wife, Yadira Breedlove, said.

== Awards and legacy ==
In 1993 Breedlove was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America and in 2000 into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame. In 2009, he was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame.

The Beach Boys&#x27; song &quot;Spirit of America&quot; was &quot;inspired by Breedlove&#x27;s land speed record, set in 1963.&quot;

<text>is a landlocked prefecture of Japan located in the Kantō region of Honshu. Saitama Prefecture has a population of 7,338,536 (January 1, 2020) and has a geographic area of 3,797 km2 (1,466 sq mi). Saitama Prefecture borders Tochigi Prefecture and Gunma Prefecture to the north, Nagano Prefecture to the west, Yamanashi Prefecture to the southwest, Tokyo to the south, Chiba Prefecture to the southeast, and Ibaraki Prefecture to the northeast.

Saitama is the capital and largest city of Saitama Prefecture, with other major cities including Kawaguchi, Kawagoe, and Tokorozawa.

== History of Kujiki ==

According to &quot;Sendai Kuji Hongi&quot; (), Chichibu was one of 137 provinces during the reign of Emperor Sujin. Chichibu Province was in western Saitama.

The area that would become Saitama Prefecture in the 19th century is part of Musashi Province in the Ritsuryō (or ryō-system; ritsu stands for the penal code, ryō for the administrative code) Imperial administration of antiquity (see Provinces of Japan and the 5 (go) capital area provinces (ki)/7 (shichi) circuits (dō) system) which was nominally revived in the Meiji restoration but has lost much of its administrative function since the Middle Ages. Saitama District &quot;(Saitama-gun)&quot; was one of Musashi&#x27;s 21 ritsuryō districts.

In the fifth year of the Keiun era (708), deposits of copper were reported to have been found in the Chichibu District of what is now Saitama Prefecture.

The Saitama area was historically known as a fertile agricultural region which produced much of the food for the Kantō region. During the Edo period, many &quot;fudai daimyōs&quot; ruled small domains within the Saitama area.

At the end of the early modern Edo period, large parts of present-day Saitama were part of the shogunate domain (&quot;baku-ryō&quot;) or the often subsumed holdings of smaller vassals &quot;(hatamoto-ryō)&quot; around Edo, major areas were part of the fiefdoms &quot;(-han)&quot; Kawagoe (ruled by Matsui/Matsudaira, &quot;fudai&quot;), Oshi (Okudaira-Matsudaira, &quot;fudai&quot;) and Iwatsuki (Ōoka, &quot;fudai&quot;); few territories were held by domains seated in other provinces.
In the Meiji Restoration, after being briefly united with other rural shogunate territories in Musashi under Musashi governors &quot;(Musashi chikenji)&quot;, many former shogunate/hatamoto territories in Northwestern Musashi became Ōmiya Prefecture (大宮県, &quot;Ōmiya-ken&quot;), soon renamed to Urawa (浦和県, &quot;-ken&quot;) in 1868/69, with some territories held by other short-lived prefectures (/later mainly Gunma and /later mainly Shizuoka, Kanagawa and Tokyo). In the replacement of &quot;-han&quot; with &quot;-ken&quot;, the associated territorial consolidation (removal of feudal era ex-/enclaves) and first wave of prefectural mergers in 1871/72, Oshi and Iwatsuki prefectures were merged into Urawa; after consolidation, it consisted of the entire Saitama District and Northern parts of Adachi and Katsushika (But at that time, &quot;major and minor districts&quot;, 大区, &quot;daiku&quot; and 小区, &quot;shōku&quot;, served as administrative subdivisions) and was renamed to Saitama. The government of the prefecture was to be set up in Iwatsuki Town, Saitama District in November 1871 by the Dajōkan ordinance to set up the prefecture, but ultimately remained in Urawa&#x27;s previous prefectural government seat in Urawa Town in Adachi District.

Kawagoe Prefecture was consolidated with other territories into (入間県, &quot;Iruma-ken&quot;; government seat unchanged from Kawagoe domain/prefecture: Kawagoe Town, Iruma District) which consisted of 13 districts of Musashi in the Western part of present-day Saitama. In 1873, Iruma was merged with Gunma (capital: Takasaki Town, Gunma District) to become Kumagaya (capital: Kumagaya Town, Ōsato District). But Kumagaya was split up again in 1876: The area of Kōzuke province came back as a second Gunma prefecture, and the territories in Musashi province/former Iruma prefecture were merged into Saitama. Except for the transfer of a few municipalities to Tokyo in the 1890s/1900s (see below) and several smaller, 20th century changes through cross-prefectural municipal mergers or transfers of neighbourhoods, Saitama had reached its present extent.
In the modern reactivation of districts as administrative unit in 1878/79, Saitama was subdivided into originally 18 districts based on the ancient divisions of Musashi, but with only nine (joint) district government offices, and the number of districts was formally merged down to nine in 1896/97: North Adachi, Iruma, Hiki, Chichibu, Kodama, Ōsato, North Saitama, South Saitama, and North Katsushika. Niikura (also known as Niiza, Shiki or Shiragi), one of the original 1878/79 modern districts, was first merged into North Adachi in 1896, but a substantial part of its former territory was subsequently transferred to the North Tama and North Toshima districts of Tokyo. In the creation of modern cities, towns and villages in 1889, these districts were subdivided into originally 40 towns and 368 villages. The first city in Saitama was only established in 1922 when Kawagoe Town from Iruma District became Kawagoe City. The prefectural capital, Urawa in North Adachi, remained a town until 1934. After the Great Shōwa mergers of the 1950s, the number of municipalities in Saitama had shrunk to 95, including 23 cities by then. The Great Heisei mergers of the 2000s pushed the number below 70.

After World War II, as Tokyo expanded rapidly and modern transportation allowed longer commutes, the lack of available land in Tokyo led to the rapid development of Saitama Prefecture, where the population has nearly tripled since 1960. Most of the cities in the prefecture are closely connected to downtown Tokyo by metropolitan rail, and operate largely as residential and commercial suburbs of Tokyo.

In 2001, Urawa City was merged with Ōmiya City and Yono City to create Saitama City (&quot;Saitama-shi&quot;; but unlike the district or the prefecture written with Kana) as the new enlarged capital. It became the prefecture&#x27;s first (and so far only) designated major city in 2003.

== Geography ==

Saitama Prefecture is bordered by Tokyo, Chiba, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Nagano, and Yamanashi Prefectures. It is located central-west of the Kanto region, measuring 103 km from east to west and 52 km from north to south. At 3,797.75 km2, it ranks as the ninth-smallest prefecture. The eastern border with Chiba Prefecture is defined by the Edo River. The northern and north-western border lines with Gunma Prefecture are marked by the Tone River and the Kanagawa River and the drainage divides of the Arakawa River and Kanagawa River. The southwestern border is defined by the drainage divides of the Arakawa River, Tama River, and Fuefuki River. The eastern section of the southern border line, however, does not overlap with any geological feature.

The topography of Saitama Prefecture is largely divided by the Hachiōji Tectonic Line, which runs through Kodama, Ogawa, and Hannō, into the western mountain area and the eastern lowland area. The altitude, highest on the western side, gradually lowers eastward from mountain ranges to hills to plateaus to lowlands. The eastern lowlands and plateaus occupy 67.3% of the area.

The eastern side, part of the Kantō Plain, can be further divided into nine separate expanses of hills and ten plateaus. The former occupy small areas neighboring the Kantō Mount Range, including the Hiki Hills and Sayama Hills. The latter are mainly surrounded by alluvial flood plains. In the southeastern portion of the prefecture, the Ōmiya Plateau stands in a southeastward direction, sandwiched by the Furutone River to the east and the Arakawa River to the west.

The western side of the prefecture belongs to the Kantō Mountain Range with Chichibu Basin located in its center. The area to the west of the basin features high peaks such as Mount Sanpō (2,483 m; 三宝山, &quot;Sanpō-yama&quot; according to the GSI, but often read &quot;Sanpō-zan&quot;) on the Western border with Nagano, Saitama&#x27;s highest mountain, and Mount Kōbushi (2,475 m), in which the Arakawa River has its source. Most of the land is contained in Chichibu Tama Kai National Park. The area to east of the basin consists of relatively low mountains.

== Politics and government ==

Like all prefectural administrations, Saitama&#x27;s is headed by a governor &quot;([ken-]chiji)&quot; who is directly elected to four-year terms since 1947. The current incumbent is Motohiro Ōno, a former DPFP member of the Diet who was elected in August 2019 with centre-left support (CDP, DPFP, SDP) and 47.9% of the vote against centre-right supported (LDP, Kōmeitō) former baseball player Kenta Aoshima (44.9%) and three other candidates.

Also as in all prefectures, prefectural by-laws, the budget and the approval of important prefectural administrative appointments such as the vice-governors or members of the public safety commission, are the prerogative of the assembly which is elected directly to four-year terms on an independent electoral cycle. That may or may not be synchronized with the gubernatorial term; currently, it is not, as it is still part of the unified local election cycle (Saitama gubernatorial elections already left the unified cycle in 1949). In the last round in April 2019, the LDP maintained its outright majority with 48 of the 93 seats in the assembly. As in most prefectures, the Saitama assembly was established legally in 1878 and first convened 1879.

In the National Diet, Saitama&#x27;s directly elected delegation consists of 15 members of the House of Representatives and currently seven (four per class, but only raised from three in 2019, so it will only grow to eight after the 2022 election) in the House of Councillors. The latest prefecture-wide election was the House of Councillors by-election in October 2019 to fill the seat vacated by Motohiro Ōno; it was won by the previous governor Kiyoshi Ueda who has a centre-left background (DPJ member of the House of Representatives for Saitama&#x27;s 4th district before his term as governor), but without full-scale party backing and without any other major party-backed candidate in the race.

<doc id="180923" wikidata="Q2981910" url="?curid=180923" title="Coinage Act of 1873">
<text>The Coinage Act of 1873 or Mint Act of 1873 was a general revision of laws relating to the Mint of the United States. By ending the right of holders of silver bullion to have it coined into standard silver dollars, while allowing holders of gold to continue to have their bullion made into money, the act created a gold standard by default. It also authorized a Trade dollar, with limited legal tender, intended for export, mainly to Asia, and abolished three small-denomination coins. The act led to controversial results and was denounced by critics as the &quot;Crime of &#x27;73&quot;.

By 1869, the Mint Act of 1837, enacted before the California gold rush or the American Civil War affected the monetary system of the United States, was deemed outdated. Treasury Secretary George Boutwell had Deputy Comptroller of the Currency John Jay Knox draft a revised law, introduced into Congress by Ohio Senator John Sherman. Silver&#x27;s market price then exceeded the value at which the Mint would purchase the metal, suppressing the demand for bullion to be struck into silver dollars. However, Knox and others correctly forecast that development of the Comstock Lode and other rich silver mines would lower silver&#x27;s market price, making the option of having bullion struck into legal-tender coins attractive. Congress considered the bill for almost three years before passage. During its consideration, it was rarely publicly mentioned, but also was not concealed, that the bill would establish a gold standard by ending bimetallism. The bill became the Act of February 12, 1873, with the signature of President Ulysses S. Grant, and became effective on April 1 of that year.

In 1876, when silver&#x27;s market price indeed dropped as forecast, producers brought silver bullion to the Mint only to learn that the Mint no longer was authorized to coin it. The matter became a major political controversy that lasted the remainder of the century, pitting those who valued the deflationary gold standard against those who believed free coinage of silver, an inflationary policy, to be necessary for economic prosperity. Despite contemporary accusations, scant evidence exists that the 1873 act had a corrupt motivation. The political dispute was settled when the gold standard was explicitly enacted into law in 1900. Beginning in March 1933, the United States rapidly abandoned the gold standard in favor of fiat currency for almost all purposes. The United States abandoned the dollar&#x27;s final formal link to gold in 1971, leaving gold and silver as commodities.

== Background ==
The Mint Act of 1792 established the Mint of the United States. The Mint, in its first decades, only coined gold and silver in response to deposits of that metal by citizens, returning the bullion to the depositor in the form of coins. Either gold or silver could be presented for conversion into currency, as both metals were a legal tender, a dollar was equal to both a legally defined weight of silver, and another legally defined quantity of gold. Having a currency defined in terms of two different metals is called bimetallism. Such a system may experience instability as the price of gold and silver on the world market changes, and this took place in the first decades after 1792, as the relative values of gold and silver in Europe changed. At that time, gold or silver U.S. coins were rarely seen in the nation, as they were heavily exported because of such shifts—most pieces in circulation were foreign in origin.

In 1834, Congress made a dollar worth slightly less, thus lightening U.S. gold and silver coins (known collectively as specie), making them uneconomical to export, and they were seen more often in commerce within the U.S. With this greater circulation, Congress re-examined the existing statutes relating to the Mint, and found many provisions to be obsolete. It enacted the Mint Act of 1837, a thorough revision of the statutes relating to the Mint. New provisions included the establishment of a bullion fund, allowing depositors to be paid without waiting for their metal to go through the coining process. The ratio of value between equivalent weights of gold and silver was adjusted slightly, allowing coins of both metals to circulate within the U.S.
When silver prices rose relative to gold as a reaction to the California Gold Rush, silver coinage was worth more than face value, and rapidly flowed overseas for melting. Despite vocal opposition led by Tennessee Representative (and future president) Andrew Johnson, the precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853, allowing them to circulate. Until then, depositors of silver could choose to have their bullion struck into silver coins of any denomination of five cents or above; the Act of 1853 lightened the silver coins from the half dime to the half dollar and eliminated the right of the depositor to have silver struck into those denominations. Depositors could still choose to have silver struck into dollar coins, but since there was more than a dollar&#x27;s worth of silver in a dollar coin, it was more profitable to sell the bullion to manufacturers and jewelers. So long as silver prices remained high, this effectively placed the United States on the gold standard.

Although the Mint rarely received deposits of silver for striking into coins after 1853, it purchased silver bullion using the new lightweight silver coins at above-market prices. This was illegal, as Congress had ordered that the new lightweight coins only be purchasable using gold, a provision intended to limit quantities sold to actual demand. As the silver pieces had a legal tender limit of $5, if excessive numbers were circulated, they might choke commerce. This in fact occurred, and merchants and bankers complained that the legal tender limit was causing them to have to sell accumulations at a discount to brokers.

The glut was replaced with a shortage when most federal coins were hoarded amid the economic chaos of the Civil War. Slowest to vanish was the base-metal cent, which only had value because government said it did, and at that time, confidence in government was shaken. Eventually, it too vanished from circulation and commanded a premium for change. A variety of makeshifts replaced the vanished coins, such as fractional currency and merchant&#x27;s tokens. Beginning in 1864, Congress began to authorize base metal coins that would not be hoarded. It reduced the weight of the cent, causing it to be made of bronze, and also required a two-cent piece of the same metal. The following year saw the initiation of the three-cent nickel and in 1866, the five-cent nickel (today simply known as the nickel) began production. The two-cent piece, initially popular, saw declining mintages as the public preferred the smaller, more convenient nickel coins.

Greenbacks, which were backed by neither silver nor gold but by the credit of the United States, and which were necessitated by vast wartime expenditures, had helped to finance the war. In the late 1860s, politicians disagreed about how quickly to have the government resume paying out gold and silver in payment of its obligations. Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch felt the best way to return to that practice was to withdraw the greenbacks as quickly as possible, and he did so until stopped by Congress, which felt his contractionist stand was hurting the economy. More and more silver was being mined in the Far West. Falls in the price of the metal made the option of depositing silver at the Mint in exchange for coin more attractive, and mintages of the silver dollar rose considerably in the late 1860s and into the 1870s. The silver dollar was fully legal tender, and some officials worried that the increased deposits would cause silver to drive gold from circulation as predicted by Gresham&#x27;s law, endangering the gold standard.

As it had been two decades since much silver was regularly deposited for striking into coins, the fact that the United States had been on a bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten. The gold standard was seen as the only possible choice, and many people assumed that the United States was on that standard, which had been adopted by strong nations like the United Kingdom (1816) and the German Empire (1871).

== Inception ==

Losses of nearly $250,000 at the San Francisco Mint had concerned the Treasury, and, in 1866, McCullough sent John Jay Knox, a Treasury employee, on a special investigatory mission. Knox found that informalities in transferring bullion between various officers of that mint had led to inconsistent sets of accounts, but due to the lack of receipts kept, it was not possible to pinpoint who was to blame. In 1869, Knox, by then Deputy Comptroller of the Currency, was sent by McCullough&#x27;s successor George Boutwell to investigate other Mint facilities, discovering severe irregularities and large government losses at the New York Assay Office. Knox again discovered a dearth of proper accounting procedures, and that officials there had trouble finding a copy of the Mint&#x27;s regulations.

In 1867, an international monetary conference was held in Paris to discuss how to have gold coins of various countries struck to a common standard. Slight adjustments to the British gold sovereign and to the five-dollar gold piece (or half eagle) would make each equal to 25 francs, and it was proposed that the British and Americans make those changes while France began striking a 25-franc piece. None of this ever came to fruition, but in January 1868, Ohio Senator John Sherman introduced legislation to place the United States formally on the gold standard, to eliminate silver as a legal tender, and to implement the recommendations of the conference.

Knox, in his 1866 report, had recommended a thorough revision of the laws pertaining to the Mint, and in January 1870, Secretary Boutwell instructed him to prepare a draft. In this, Knox had the assistance of former Mint Director Henry Linderman, who then held a roving commission for the Treasury Department; Linderman would in 1873 become the first director of the Bureau of the Mint.

Knox completed a draft bill, intended to repeal many antiquated legal provisions, and to rewrite others. He proposed to eliminate the standard silver dollar (he proposed a lightweight silver dollar that would have a low legal tender limit), move the office of the Director of the Mint from Philadelphia to Washington, eliminate the Mint&#x27;s charge to strike gold bullion (then 0.5 percent), and abolish the office of Treasurer at the mints and assay offices, transferring its functions to the superintendent. In drafting the bill, Knox consulted with a number of former Mint officers besides Linderman, such as former directors James Ross Snowden and Robert M. Patterson, as well as former Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Mint Director James Pollard submitted the bill to Congress on April 25, 1870.

== Consideration and passage ==
Sherman introduced the bill on April 28, 1870, and it was referred to the Senate Finance Committee, of which he was chairman. He did not seek its passage in that session of Congress, as lawmakers were busy with other financial legislation. The bill attracted next to no newspaper attention throughout the period of almost three years it was under consideration, though monetary experts and others watched its progress closely. On January 9, 1871, Sherman brought the bill to the Senate floor for debate. That it abolished the silver dollar, and thus bimetallism, was not discussed, as senators focused on the omission of the coinage charge (the fee for the Mint&#x27;s services in converting bullion to money). This was of importance to the Senate—especially members from the Far West—because it affected what mining companies and refiners (an important economic interest) could get for their product. Sherman offered an amendment to retain the coinage charge, but it was attacked by Western senators as an unjust tax on miners and refiners of gold, and the amendment was defeated, 26–23. On January 10, the bill passed the Senate, 36–14, with Sherman voting against his own bill. It was then sent to the House of Representatives and referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures from which it was briefly brought forth on February 25 by Pennsylvania&#x27;s William D. Kelley, the chairman, before being recommitted to committee. The bill was not considered by the House during the remainder of the 41st Congress, which expired on March 3, 1871, and the Senate-passed bill died with it.

Kelley reintroduced the bill in the House when Congress reconvened in December 1871. Chairman Kelley was from Philadelphia, and was influenced by industrialist Joseph Wharton, who owned a nickel refinery in nearby Camden, New Jersey, from which the Mint purchased, without competitive bidding, much of the metal for the three-cent and five-cent base metal coins. The bill at that time proposed that the cent, then made of bronze, be made of nickel alloy as well—when it was debated on January 9, 1872, Wharton&#x27;s interest was an immediate target. Kelley was quizzed by New York Representative Clarkson Potter, who called the bill &quot;this Pennsylvania contrivance&quot; which would give &quot;a monopoly to the gentleman in Pennsylvania [Wharton].&quot; Another New Yorker, Dwight Townsend, moved to scuttle the bill in disgust over how long it was taking to pass; his motion on voice vote would have succeeded, but there was no quorum and it failed on a roll call vote. On January 10, Missouri Congressman James R. McCormick, who represented nickel producers in his home state, introduced an amendment for competitive bidding for nickel purchases by the Mint. Rather than accede to McCormick&#x27;s amendment, Kelley sent the bill back to committee.

When the bill was brought back to the House floor on April 9, 1872, it was managed by Massachusetts Representative Samuel Hooper, chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency. He went through the bill section by section, and stated the bill would place the United States on the gold standard. In the ensuing debate, other representatives, including Potter and Kelley, showed their understanding of that. The bill now provided for competitive nickel bidding, but was again withdrawn, this time by Hooper, after Kelley accused Potter of trying to benefit New York bullion merchants. This fracas caused other New Yorkers to oppose the bill. On May 27, Hooper presented a substitute bill, which he got passed, 110–13, without it even being read. Among the changes that the House made to Knox&#x27;s bill were a slight increase in weight of the subsidiary silver coins (the dime, quarter dollar, and half dollar), making a dollar in them weigh .

The bill then awaited Congress reconvening in December. Early in that month, Secretary Boutwell issued his annual report, calling for the passage of the legislation. On the 16th, the bill was referred to Sherman&#x27;s committee. It emerged without the plan to make the cent from copper-nickel, and with the lightweight silver dollar replaced with a Trade dollar intended for commerce in the Far East, having limited legal tender status in the U.S. The bill was reported back to the Senate on January 7, 1873. It was debated there on the 17th.

One topic of discussion was the bill&#x27;s requirement that an eagle appear on larger U.S. coins. Linderman had requested an amendment to require that gold and silver coins bear a statement of their weight and fineness, which would mean sacrificing the eagle. California&#x27;s Eugene Casserly opposed the amendment, which was sponsored by Sherman, stating &quot;it will hardly be possible to think of a half dollar or a quarter dollar as being such a coin without the eagle upon it&quot;. The eagle was saved when the amendment failed, 24 in favor and 26 against. Casserly was less successful with an amendment to remove entirely the reduced coinage charge of 0.2 percent, which failed. Sherman moved the bill along as quickly as he could, and it passed without a recorded vote. The House initially refused to agree to the Trade dollar; representatives of both houses, led by Sherman and Potter, met in a conference committee, and the House acceded to the Senate amendment for the Trade dollar. The bill passed both houses without further debate, and was signed by President Ulysses S. Grant on February 12, 1873. At no point in its almost three-year journey through the legislative process did the bill provide for the retention of the standard silver dollar, into which depositors could have their bullion coined.

=== Intent of the bill&#x27;s authors ===

When, several years after its passage, the 1873 law became a political issue, some of those involved in enacting it, including Sherman and Linderman, stated that there had been no intent to end bimetallism in the elimination of the authority for private citizens to have silver bullion coined into dollars. They argued that the 1853 legislation had ended the practice of having bullion struck into smaller-denomination coins; the 1873 act simply rectified an omission and eliminated a coin with a low mintage that did not circulate. They were not always consistent in their denials: Boutwell wrote in his memoirs that &quot;in 1873 I had come to believe that it was wise for every nation to recognize, establish, and maintain the gold standard ... hence it was that I determined to abandon the idea of a double [i.e., bimetallic] standard.

Within a few years, the idea that the omission of the silver dollar from the Coinage Act had not been with intent to place the United States on the gold standard became the establishment position. Part of this was in reaction against the conspiracy theories that were circulating about the &quot;Crime of &#x27;73&quot;, as advocates of bimetallism called the act. This was accepted by many historians well into the 20th century. Neil Carothers, in his 1930 history of small-denomination U.S. currency, wrote that &quot;many others have demonstrated that this was not a corrupt or surreptitious action by the enemies of silver. The elimination of the standard silver dollar was simply in the interests of clarifying the coinage law ... Not one party to the passage of the law of 1873 recognized the significance of the abolition of the legally existing double standard.&quot; According to historian Allen Weinstein, &quot;Silver&#x27;s demonetization, according to the traditional account, came as an unplanned if fortunate by-product of a complex and largely technical revision of the mint laws in the Coinage Act of 1873.&quot;

Economist Milton Friedman wrote, &quot;what is not open to question is that the standard silver dollar was omitted from the list of coins to be minted intentionally, in full knowledge of the likely consequences, and in the belief that those consequences were desirable.&quot; He cited Walter T. K. Nugent&#x27;s 1968 book, &quot;Money and American Society, 1865–1880&quot;,

Knox and Linderman were both personally familiar with mining conditions in the Far West. They knew that the amount of bullion produced was only going to increase, and would likely drop the price of silver below the level ($1.2929 per troy ounce) at which the metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money. In his explanatory statement accompanying his draft bill, Knox explained the discontinuance of the silver dollar would mean the United States was no longer a bimetallic nation. Boutwell, in his 1872 annual report, urged Congress to end the coinage of silver from private deposits, lest the government take a loss from paying out gold in exchange for the silver dollars, and ultimately having to melt them when they could not be circulated. According to Nugent, &quot;Were Knox, Linderman, Boutwell, Sherman, and others aware of what they were doing when they planned to drop the silver dollar? It is inconceivable that they were not; Knox&#x27;s statement was explicit. But did they urge it because they feared a drop in silver prices? No one made an explicit statement to that effect, but it was undoubtedly the case.&quot;

== Provisions ==

=== Bureau of the Mint; duties of officers (§§1–12) ===

The Director of the Mint had always been located at the Philadelphia Mint, with the other mints and assay offices governed by superintendents of whom the director was in charge. The 1873 act moved the office to Washington, where the director supervised the new Bureau of the Mint and remained in charge of all mints and assay offices. The Mint Director required appointment by the president and confirmation by the Senate and served a term of five years (unless removed by the president). Henceforth, the Philadelphia Mint would be under the immediate control of a superintendent, like the other mints. The act also formally made the bureau part of the Department of the Treasury. The Mint of the United States had originally reported directly to the president but over time legislation had made it subject to control by the Treasury Secretary.

Little change was made to the officers of the mints, other than adding a superintendent for Philadelphia (Pollock would be the first incumbent), and abolishing the office of Treasurer at each facility. In addition to the superintendent, each mint had as officers the Assayer, the Melter and Refiner, and the Coiner; each was required to post a bond to indemnify the government against losses during their tenure of office, and each was responsible for part of the coining process. Philadelphia also had an Engraver (sometimes Chief Engraver), responsible for preparing coinage dies and designs, though the Director of the Mint could, with the agreement of the Treasury Secretary, hire outside artists to design coins. The provision allowing for the hiring of outside artists was inserted at the suggestion of former director Patterson. The act set the salaries and bonding requirements for the officers, and required them to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, as was the case under both the 1792 and 1837 acts. It also set forth the procedures for appointment of an acting officer or Director of the Mint, in the case of the incumbent&#x27;s temporary absence.

=== Coins and deposit of bullion (§§13–39) ===


Sections 14 to 16 of the act set forth the coins authorized to be struck by the Mint Bureau. This is the part of the act that would later prove contentious, as it omitted the standard silver dollar, since 1853 the only coin into which depositors of silver bullion could have their metal struck. It did allow for a Trade dollar, of higher weight than the old coin, that depositors could have their silver made into, but the legal tender of this and all silver coins was limited to $5—the old silver dollar had an unlimited legal tender. All gold coins had unlimited legal tender, and the act made provision for the redemption of gold coin abraded below normal weight at full value, if twenty years or more old and if still containing 99.5 percent or more of the authorized weight. Lightweight gold coin that did not meet these qualifications would have the loss in value fall upon the depositor.

Also eliminated by the 1873 act were the two-cent piece, three-cent silver and half dime. Although the first two coins circulated little, the half dime was still being heavily struck by the San Francisco Mint for use in the Far West, where paper money was disfavored. The coins authorized by the 1873 act were the cent, three-cent nickel, five-cent nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, Trade dollar, gold dollar, quarter eagle, three-dollar piece, half eagle, eagle, and double eagle.

The act prescribed the specifications of each coin. No change was made to the bronze composition of the cent. The dime, quarter, and half dollar were made slightly heavier so that a dollar in these coins would weigh , in a nod to the metric system—the five-cent nickel already weighed . It required that the obverse of each American coin be emblematic of Liberty, and that an eagle must appear on the reverse, except for the small-diameter cent, three-cent nickel, five-cent nickel, dime, gold dollar, and three-dollar piece, on which an eagle could not appear. It required the use of the country&#x27;s name on the reverse, and of &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; somewhere on the coin. It allowed the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; to appear on American coinage—continuing permission granted in the Act of March 3, 1865, which had authorized the three-cent nickel. The 1873 law allowed for the redemption of current or obsolete base-metal coinage by the Treasury when presented in lots of $20 or more, continuing a provision enacted in 1871.

Further provisions in this part of the act allowed depositors of silver bullion to receive their metal back in the form of bars or in Trade dollars. It forbade deposit of silver for striking into other coins, but allowed the Mint, for two years, to purchase silver bullion with silver coins at Philadelphia and at the New York Assay Office. This practice, although illegal under the 1853 act, had long been permitted by Mint Directors.

=== Testing and the Assay Commission (§§40–50) ===

The annual Assay Commission met at the Philadelphia Mint in most years from 1797 to 1980, when it was abolished. Consisting of government officials and members of the public, it tested the gold and silver coins issued by the Mint to ensure they met standards.

The 1837 act had designated the judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the United States Attorney for that district, and the Collector of the Port of Philadelphia as members &quot;ex officio&quot; of the Assay Commission. The Coinage Act of 1873 kept the judge as a member, but omitted the other two, substituting the Comptroller of the Currency and the assayer of the New York Assay Office. Under the 1837 act, the president was allowed to appoint members of the public each year, and this continued under the new legislation. The 1873 law also prescribed a detailed procedure for taking samples from each delivery by that mint&#x27;s Coiner, sealing them in envelopes and transmitting them to Philadelphia, where the Assay Commission met each February.

This part of the Coinage Act also provided as to how the Coiner should settle accounts, for internal testing of coins outside the auspices of the Assay Commission, and continued the bullion fund, allowing depositors of gold or silver to receive coins or other payment without having to wait for the actual metal they had deposited to go through the coining process. The mints were required to have a set of weights conforming to the official weight weighing one troy pound purchased by the U.S. minister in London in 1827, and to have the ones at Philadelphia tested in the presence of the Assay Commission each year.

=== Criminal offenses and miscellaneous provisions (§§51–67) ===
Sections 51 to 53 regulated matters that had proved controversial in past decades. Section 51 required all obverse dies (containing the date on most denominations) to be destroyed at the conclusion of each year. Under Director Snowden in the 1850s, the Mint had restruck rare early-dated coins to sell or exchange with collectors. Medals of a national nature could be struck at Philadelphia under Section 52, but private medals were forbidden. Until 1854, the year in which he was fired by President Franklin Pierce, Peale had conducted a controversial medals business on the premises of the Philadelphia Mint. Section 53 required the bureau&#x27;s profits from seigniorage to be deposited in the Treasury and forbade the Mint from paying expenses or salaries from that money. Under Director Patterson (retired 1851), the Mint had retained such earnings, and spent them without congressional oversight.

The assay offices were regulated by sections 54 through 60, under the control of the Director of the Mint. Each office would be governed in a manner similar to the mints, with a superintendent in charge and two subordinate officers: an Assayer and a Melter and Refiner. Sections 61 to 64 forbade counterfeiting, intentional lightening of coins to secure metal, and other offenses, and prescribed the punishments for them. Section 65 is a transition provision, setting an April 1, 1873 effective date, as well as providing that the current Director of the Mint (Pollock) would become superintendent at Philadelphia, and the occupants of the office of Treasurer at each mint (abolished by the legislation) would become Assistant Treasurers of the United States. Section 66 names each mint and assay office, and Section 67 names the legislation as the &quot;Coinage Act of one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three&quot;.

=== Later reaction ===

The abolition of the half dime, still circulating in the Far West, led to shortages of small change there. Congress tried to address this with the unpopular twenty-cent piece, which was struck for circulation only in 1875 and 1876 and was rejected by the public for its similarity to the quarter dollar. The Western United States was not fully supplied with small change until the Mint began striking cents there in 1908 and five-cent nickels in 1912. The Trade dollar, struck principally to compete with Mexican dollars in the Far East trade, failed to gain full acceptance in the Orient. Many were returned to (or never left) the United States. As they could be purchased at a discount, they were popular among employers, who placed them in workers&#x27; pay packets. In 1876, Congress revoked even the limited legal tender status they enjoyed; in 1878, the Mint stopped striking them except for collectors, and even that limited issue ceased after 1885. In 1887, Congress allowed a six-month window during which they could be redeemed for other currency, provided they had not been chopmarked by Asian merchants.
As Friedman noted, if the price of silver had remained high, the exclusion of the silver dollar from the 1873 act would have been irrelevant. By 1874, the effect of the new mines in the Far West, and the sale of silver in Germany following its demonetization there, combined to force the price of silver down. Silver producers had not been aware of the statutory change, and only learned of it when they sought to present silver at the mints for coining. According to numismatic historian Don Taxay, &quot;an agitation followed, during which several pious Congressmen feigned ignorance of the repeal, maintaining it had been worked into the Mint bill surreptitiously.&quot; One Delaware manufacturer wrote to his senator, Thomas F. Bayard, in 1878, &quot;at the beginning ... I was totally ignorant of all that related to the silver question—so much in fact that (I find now like almost everyone else not excluding Congressmen!) I did not know Silver had been demonetized.&quot;

A severe depression, the Panic of 1873, began in the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came to believe the gold standard too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore bimetallism. The inflation caused by such a policy would enable debtors to repay what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.

In early 1875, Congress passed a bill for the resumption of specie payments (that is, in gold and silver coin)—effective in 1879. Friedman stated that had it not been for the 1873 act, resumption would have been on the effective basis of a silver standard, which he viewed as a good thing, allowing for more economic stability and &quot;almost surely would have avoided&quot; the downturn of the early 1890s known as the Panic of 1893.
Support for bimetallism grew in the 1870s, and resulted in the passage of the Bland–Allison Act of February 28, 1878, over the veto of President Rutherford B. Hayes. This legislation required the Treasury to purchase millions of dollars&#x27; worth of silver bullion each month, and coin it into silver dollars. The denomination was restored as a legal tender, except when gold was specified by law or private contract. Renewed support for silver led to the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, greatly increasing the silver purchases, and requiring the Treasury to pay for them in banknotes that could be redeemed for gold. Over the next three years, $132,000,000 in gold was withdrawn from the Treasury, and amid another depression President Grover Cleveland secured the repeal of the silver purchase act.

The free silver movement reached its height with the 1896 campaign of former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan, who won the Democratic nomination for president after his Cross of Gold speech, which decried the gold standard, electrified the 1896 Democratic National Convention. Bryan was defeated in the election by former Ohio governor William McKinley, and in 1900, Congress passed the Gold Standard Act, placing that standard into law. The gold standard was departed from for many purposes by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal administration, and completely ended by President Richard Nixon in 1971.

=== &quot;Crime of &#x27;73&quot; ===
&quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; on April 1, 1873, reported the passage of the Coinage Act. It noted the abolition of the two-cent piece and the authorization of the Trade dollar, but did not mention the ending of the standard silver dollar. There was no widespread objection to the 1873 act until 1876. Several factors combined to bring forth protest then: tight money policies by the Treasury in preparation for the resumption of specie payments, a more precipitous drop in the price of silver than had hitherto been the case, and widespread use of Trade dollars after their rejection in the Chinese market. At the same time, the Comstock Lode and other Western mining areas were producing record amounts of silver. With a depression still ongoing, silver began to be seen as a means of inflating the currency and stimulating the economy.

Beginning in March 1876, former newspaper editor George Weston published letters asserting that bimetallism was mandated by the Constitution, and questioning how the Coinage Act had passed. Sympathetic newspapers began to suggest that the legislation had been enacted through corruption for the benefit of wealthy capitalists. On August 5, 1876, Missouri Congressman Richard P. Bland (soon to be known as &quot;Silver Dick&quot;) told the House of Representatives, &quot;The act of February 12, 1873 was a fraud, because its title gave no clue to the real intent of the act. The record shows that the act was stealthily passed, without reconsideration and without debate.&quot; In 1878, Congressman Kelley, who had introduced the bill into the House, stated, &quot;I was ignorant of the fact it would demonetize the silver dollar&quot;.

Often blamed by those who deemed the act a crime was British financial writer Ernest Seyd, who had given advice as to the text of the bill, as attested by Congressman Hooper on the House floor in 1872. Seyd, according to this theory, was the agent of a group of British holders of American bonds, who had sent Seyd to America with £100,000 (then about $550,000) to bribe congressmen into demonetizing silver. Kelley denied this had taken place, but the story stuck, and became a common belief in the silver movement. In 1890, Seyd&#x27;s corrupt involvement was asserted on the floor of the House of Representatives by Arkansas&#x27;s Thomas C. McRae. Seyd was in fact an ardent bimetallist who strongly objected to the American demonetization of silver. He had submitted, at Hooper&#x27;s request, an analysis of the bill in the course of which he advocated retaining the silver dollar as a legal tender.

The earliest use of the phrase &quot;Crime of 1873&quot; in congressional debate was by Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller, who on July 10, 1890, stated, &quot;the fight for free coinage [of silver] is on, and it will stay on, too, till the will of the people shall be heard in the enactment of a law that shall put silver back where it belongs and where it would have been but for the blunder or the crime of 1873&quot;. The act had long been referred to as a &quot;crime&quot; without the exact phrase being used; in one 1889 speech, Nevada Senator William M. Stewart called it a &quot;crime&quot; seven times. He had voted for it in 1873.

<doc id="180924" wikidata="Q1940379" url="?curid=180924" title="Black Mafia Life">
<text>Black Mafia Life is the second studio album by American hip hop group Above the Law. This album is what would be considered the blueprint of the G-Funk sound similar to Dr Dre&#x27;s The Chronic. The album was recorded in 1991 into 1992 but was held back due to legal issues with Epic And Dr. Dre&#x27;s Departure from Ruthless Records. It was released on February 2, 1993, via Ruthless Records. The album peaked at number 6 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 37 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 4.5 stars of 5.

As on the group&#x27;s previous works, &quot;Livin&#x27; Like Hustlers&quot; and &quot;Vocally Pimpin&#x27;&quot;, this album&#x27;s audio production was mostly handled by A.T.L. themselves, but this one excluded any contributions from Lay Law. It featured guest appearances from Kokane, Eazy-E, 2Pac, MC Ren, and Money-B. Its lead single &quot;V.S.O.P.&quot; peaked at number 9 on the Hot Rap Singles and number 97 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks.

Above the Law member Go Mack left the group after release of this album.

<doc id="180930" wikidata="Q5535417" url="?curid=180930" title="Geology of the Appalachians">
<text>The geology of the Appalachians dates back more than 1.2 billion years to the Mesoproterozoic era when two continental cratons collided to form the supercontinent Rodinia, 500 million years prior to the development of the range during the formation of Pangea. The rocks exposed in today&#x27;s Appalachian Mountains reveal elongate belts of folded and thrust faulted marine sedimentary rocks, volcanic rocks, and slivers of ancient ocean floor—strong evidences that these rocks were deformed during plate collision. The birth of the Appalachian ranges marks the first of several mountain building plate collisions that culminated in the construction of Pangea with the Appalachians and neighboring Anti-Atlas mountains (now in Morocco) near the center. These mountain ranges likely once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before they were eroded.

== Geological history ==
=== Overview ===
The Appalachian Mountains formed through a series of mountain-building events over the last 1.2 billion years:

* The Grenville orogeny began 1250 million years ago (Ma) and lasted for 270 million years.
* The Taconic orogeny began 450 Ma and lasted for 10 million years.
* The Acadian orogeny began 375 Ma and lasted 50 million years.
* The Alleghanian orogeny began 325 Ma and lasted 65 million years.

=== Proterozoic era ===
==== Grenville orogeny ====

The first mountain-building tectonic plate collision that initiated the construction of what are today the Appalachian Mountains occurred during the Mesoproterozoic era at least one billion years ago when the pre-North-American craton called Laurentia collided with other continental segments, notably Amazonia. All the other cratons of the Earth also collided at about this time to form the supercontinent Rodinia, which was surrounded by one single ocean. Mountain-building referred to as the Grenville orogeny occurred along the boundaries of the cratons. The present Appalachian Mountains have at least two areas which are made from rock formations that were formed during this orogeny: the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Adirondacks.

==== Breakup of Rodinia ==== 
After the Grenville orogeny, the direction of the continental drift reversed, and Rodinia began to break up. The mountains formed during the Grenvillian era underwent erosion from weathering, glaciation, and other natural processes, resulting in the leveling of the landscape. The eroded sediments from these mountains contributed to the formation of sedimentary basins and valleys. 

For example, in what is now the southern United States, the Ocoee basin was formed. Seawater filled the basin. Rivers from the surrounding countryside carried clay, silt, sand, and gravel to the basin, much as rivers today carry sediment from the midcontinent region to the Gulf of Mexico. The sediment spread out in layers on the basin floor. The basin continued to subside, and over a long period of time, probably millions of years, a great thickness of sediment accumulated. 

Eventually, the tectonic forces pulling the two continents apart became so strong that the Iapetus Ocean formed off the eastern coast of the Laurentian margin. The rocks of the Valley and Ridge province formed over millions of years, in the Iapetus. Shells and other hard parts of ancient marine plants and animals accumulated to form limey deposits that later became limestone. This is the same process by which limestone forms in modern oceans. The weathering of limestone exposed at the land surface produces the lime-rich soils that are so prevalent in the fertile farmland of the Valley and Ridge province.

During this continental break-up, around 600 million to 560 million years ago, volcanic activity was present along the tectonic margins. There is evidence of this activity in today&#x27;s Blue Ridge Mountains. Mount Rogers, Whitetop Mountain, and Pine Mountain are all the result of volcanic activity that occurred around this time. Evidence of subsurface activity (dikes and sills intruding into the overlying rock) is present in the Blue Ridge as well. For instance, mafic rocks have been found along the Fries Fault in the central Blue Ridge area of Montgomery County, Virginia. 

=== Paleozoic era ===

During the earliest part of the Paleozoic, the continent that would later become North America straddled the equator. The Appalachian region was a passive plate margin, not unlike today&#x27;s Atlantic Coastal Plain province. During this interval, the region was periodically submerged beneath shallow seas. Thick layers of sediment and carbonate rock were deposited on the shallow sea bottom when the region was submerged. When seas receded, terrestrial sedimentary deposits and erosion dominated.

During the middle Ordovician (about 458-470 million years ago), a change in plate motions set the stage for the first Paleozoic mountain building event (Taconic orogeny) in North America. The once quiet Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic crust, the Iapetus, collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton. With the creation of this new subduction zone, the early Appalachians were born.

Volcanoes grew along the continental margin, coincident with the initiation of subduction. Thrust faulting uplifted and warped older sedimentary rock laid down on the passive margin. As mountains rose, erosion began to wear them down. Streams carried rock debris downslope to be deposited in nearby lowlands.

Mountain building continued periodically throughout the next 250 million years (the Caledonian, Acadian, Ouachita, Hercynian, and Alleghanian orogenies). Continent after continent was thrust and sutured onto the North American craton as Pangea began to take shape. Microplates, smaller bits of crust too small to be called continents, were swept in one by one to be welded to the growing mass.

By about 300 million years ago (the Pennsylvanian period), Africa was approaching the North American craton. The collisional belt spread into the Ozark-Ouachita region and through the Marathon Mountains area of Texas. Continental collisions raised the Appalachian-Ouachita chain to a lofty mountain range on the scale of the present-day Himalayas. The massive bulk of Pangea was completed near the end of the Paleozoic era (the Permian period) when Africa (Gondwana) plowed into the continental agglomeration, with the Appalachian-Ouachita mountains near the middle.

=== Mesozoic era and later ===
Pangea began to break up about 220 million years ago, in the early Mesozoic (late Triassic period). As Pangea rifted apart a new passive tectonic margin was born, and the forces that created the Appalachian, Ouachita, and Marathon Mountains were stilled. Weathering and erosion prevailed, and the mountains began to wear away.

By the end of the Mesozoic, the Appalachian Mountains had been eroded to an almost-flat plain. It was not until the region was uplifted during the Cenozoic era that the distinctive topography of the present formed. Uplift rejuvenated the streams, which rapidly responded by cutting downward into the ancient bedrock. Some streams flowed along weak layers that define the folds and faults created many millions of years earlier. Other streams downcut so rapidly that they cut right across the resistant folded rocks of the mountain core, carving canyons across rock layers and geologic structures. The ridges of the Appalachian Mountain core represent erosion-resistant rock that remained after the rock above and beside it was eroded away.

== Physiographic provinces==
The geographic boundaries of the Appalachian Mountains follow a definition that accounts for all the land mass in the United States and Canada used by the US Geological Survey and the Geologic Survey of Canada using the science of physiography. The US uses the term Appalachian Highlands, and Canada uses the term Appalachian Uplands, to define contiguous regions that have similar geology, topography, history, and native plant and animal communities. (The Appalachian Mountains are not synonymous with the Appalachian Plateau, which is one of the provinces of the Appalachian Highlands).

=== Appalachian Basin ===
The Appalachian Basin is a foreland basin containing Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of early Cambrian through early Permian age. From north to south, the Appalachian Basin province crosses New York, Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, West Virginia, western Maryland, eastern Kentucky, western Virginia, eastern Tennessee, northwestern Georgia, and northeastern Alabama. The northern end of the Appalachian Basin extends offshore into Lakes Erie and Ontario as far as the United States–Canada border. The province covers an area of about and is long from northeast to southwest and between wide from northwest to southeast.

The northwestern flank of the basin is a broad homocline that dips gently southeastward off the Cincinnati Arch. A complexly thrust faulted and folded terrane (Appalachian Fold and Thrust Belt or Eastern Overthrust Belt), formed at the end of the Paleozoic by the Alleghanian orogeny, characterizes the eastern flank of the basin. Metamorphic and igneous rocks of the Blue Ridge Thrust Belt that bounds the eastern part of the Appalachian Basin Province were thrust westward more than over lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks.

==== Coal, oil, and gas production ====
The Appalachian Basin is one of the most important coal producing regions in the U.S. and one of the largest in the world. Bituminous coal has been mined throughout the last three centuries. Currently, the coal primarily is used within the eastern U.S. or exported for electrical power generation, but some of it is suitable for metallurgical uses. Economically important coal beds were deposited primarily during Pennsylvanian time in a southeastward-thickening foreland basin. Coal and associated rocks form a clastic wedge that thickens from north to south, from Pennsylvania into southeast West Virginia and southwestern Virginia.

Discovery of oil in 1859 in the Drake Well, Venango County, Pennsylvania, marked the beginning of the oil and gas industry in the Appalachian Basin. The discovery well opened a prolific trend of oil and gas fields, producing from upper Devonian, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian sandstone reservoirs that extend from southern New York, across western Pennsylvania, central West Virginia, and eastern Ohio, to eastern Kentucky.

A second major trend of oil and gas production in the Appalachian Basin began with the discovery in 1885 of oil and gas in lower Silurian Clinton sandstone reservoirs in Knox County, Ohio. By the late 1880s and early 1900s, the trend extended both north and south across east-central Ohio and included several counties in western New York where gas was discovered in lower Silurian Medina Group sandstones. About 1900, large oil reserves were discovered in Silurian and Devonian carbonate reservoirs in east-central Kentucky. Important gas discoveries from the lower Devonian Oriskany Sandstone in Guernsey County, Ohio, in 1924; Schuyler County, New York, in 1930; and Kanawha County, West Virginia, in 1936 opened a major gas-producing trend across parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia. Another drilling boom occurred in the 1960s in Morrow County, Ohio, where oil was discovered in the Upper Cambrian part of the Knox Dolomite.

=== Crystalline Appalachians ===

The Blue Ridge, Piedmont, Adirondack, and New England Provinces are collectively known as the Crystalline Appalachians because they consist of Precambrian and Cambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks.

The Blue Ridge Thrust Belt Province underlies parts of eight states from central Alabama to southern Pennsylvania. Along its western margin, the Blue Ridge is thrust over the folded and faulted margin of the Appalachian basin, so that a broad segment of Paleozoic strata extends eastward for tens of miles, buried beneath these subhorizontal crystalline thrust sheets. At the surface, the Blue Ridge consists of a mountainous to hilly region, the main component of which are the Blue Ridge Mountains that extend from Georgia to Pennsylvania. Surface rocks consist mainly of a core of moderate-to high-rank crystalline metamorphic or igneous rocks which, because of their superior resistance to weathering and erosion, commonly rise above the adjacent areas of low-grade metamorphic and sedimentary rock. The province is bounded on the north and west by the Paleozoic strata of the Appalachian Basin and on the south by Cretaceous and younger sedimentary rocks of the Gulf Coastal Plain. It is bounded on the east by metamorphic and sedimentary rocks of the Piedmont Province.

The Adirondack and New England Provinces include sedimentary, meta-sedimentary, and plutonic igneous rocks, mainly of Cambrian and Ordovician age, similar lithologically to rocks in the Blue Ridge and Piedmont Provinces to the south. The uplifted, nearly-circular Adirondack Mountains consist of a core of ancient Precambrian rocks that are surrounded by upturned Cambrian and Ordovician sedimentary rocks.

<text>The Peace of Utrecht was a series of peace treaties signed by the belligerents in the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Dutch city of Utrecht between April 1713 and February 1715. The war involved three contenders for the vacant throne of Spain, and involved much of Europe for over a decade. Essentially, the treaties allowed Philip V (grandson of King Louis XIV of France) to keep the Spanish throne in return for permanently renouncing his claim to the French throne, along with other necessary guarantees that would ensure that France and Spain should not merge, thus preserving the balance of power in Europe.

The treaties between several European states, including Spain, Great Britain, France, Portugal, Savoy and the Dutch Republic, helped end the war. The treaties were concluded between the representatives of Louis XIV of France and of his grandson Philip on one hand, and representatives of Queen Anne of Great Britain, King Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, King John V of Portugal and the United Provinces of the Netherlands on the other. Though the king of France ensured the Spanish crown for his dynasty, the treaties marked the end of French ambitions of hegemony in Europe expressed in the continuous wars of Louis XIV, and paved the way to the European system based on the balance of power.

==Negotiations==

On 2 January 1710, King Louis XIV of France agreed to commence .

France and Great Britain had come to terms in October 1711, when the preliminaries of peace had been signed in London. The preliminaries were based on a tacit acceptance of the partition of Spain&#x27;s European possessions. Following this, the Congress of Utrecht opened on 29 January 1712, with the British representatives being John Robinson, Bishop of Bristol, and Thomas Wentworth, Lord Strafford. Reluctantly the United Provinces accepted the preliminaries and sent representatives, but Emperor Charles VI refused to do so until he was assured that the preliminaries were not binding. This assurance was given, and so in February the Imperial representatives made their appearance. As Philip was not yet recognized as its king, Spain did not at first send plenipotentiaries, but the Duke of Savoy sent one, and the Kingdom of Portugal was represented by Luís da Cunha. One of the first questions discussed was the nature of the guarantees to be given by France and Spain that their crowns would be kept separate, and little progress was made until 10 July 1712, when Philip signed a renunciation.

With Great Britain, France and Spain having agreed to a &quot;suspension of arms&quot; (armistice) covering Spain on 19 August in Paris, the pace of negotiation quickened. The first treaty signed at Utrecht was the truce between France and Portugal on 7 November, followed by the truce between France and Savoy on 14 March 1713. That same day, Spain, Great Britain, France and the Empire agreed to the evacuation of Catalonia and an armistice in Italy. The main treaties of peace followed on 11 April 1713. These were five separate treaties between France and Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Savoy, Prussia and Portugal. Spain under Philip V signed separate peace treaties with Savoy and Great Britain at Utrecht on 13 July. Negotiations at Utrecht dragged on into the next year, for the peace treaty between Spain and the Netherlands was only signed on 26 June 1714 and that between Spain and Portugal on 6 February 1715.

Several other treaties came out of the congress of Utrecht. France signed treaties of commerce and navigation with Great Britain and the Dutch Republic (11 April 1713). Great Britain signed a like treaty with Spain (9 December 1713).

== Treaties ==


==Principal provisions==

The Peace confirmed the Bourbon candidate as Philip V of Spain to remain as king. In return, Philip renounced the French throne, both for himself and his descendants, with reciprocal renunciations by French Bourbons to the Spanish throne, including Louis XIV&#x27;s nephew Philippe of Orléans. These became increasingly important after a series of deaths between 1712 and 1714 left the five year old Louis XV as his great-grandfather&#x27;s heir.

Great Britain was the main beneficiary; Utrecht marked the point at which it became the primary European commercial power. In Article X, Spain ceded the strategic ports of Gibraltar and Menorca.

In a major coup for the British delegation, the British government emerged from the treaty with the &quot;Asiento de Negros&quot;, which referred to the monopoly contract granted by the Spanish government to other European nations to supply slaves to Spain&#x27;s colonies in the Americas. The &quot;Asiento de Negros&quot; had come about due to the fact that the Spanish Empire rarely engaged in the transatlantic slave trade itself, preferring to outsource this to foreign merchants. Bourbon France had previously held the &quot;Asiento de Negros&quot;, allowing French slave traders to supply 5,000 slaves to the Spanish Empire each year; France had gained control over this contract after Philip V had become King of Spain. After the British government gained access to the &quot;Asiento de Negros&quot;, the economic prominence held by Dutch Sephardic Jewish slaveowners began to fade, while the South Sea Company was established in hopes of gaining exclusive access to the contract. The British government sought to reduce its debt by increasing the volume of trade it had with Spain, which required gaining access to the &quot;Asiento de Negros&quot;; as historian G.M. Trevelyan noted: &quot;The finances of the country were based in May 1711 on the assumption that the Asiento, or monopoly of the slave trade with Spanish America, would be wrested from France as an integral part of the terms of peace&quot;. Following the passage of the treaty, the British government gained a thirty-year access to the &quot;Asiento de Negros&quot;.

The importance placed by British negotiators on commercial interests was demonstrated by their demand for France to &quot;level the fortifications of Dunkirk, block up the port and demolish the sluices that scour the harbour, [which] shall never be reconstructed&quot;. This was because Dunkirk was the primary base for French privateers, as it was possible to reach the North Sea in a single tide and escape British patrols in the English Channel.
Under Article XIII and, despite the British demands to preserve Catalan constitutions and rights in return for Catalonia&#x27;s support for the Allies during the war, Spain only agreed to grant an amnesty, thus implying the imposition of the laws and institutions of Castile to the Principality of Catalonia, as it already happened in 1707 to the other occupied kingdoms of the Crown of Aragon. Spanish territories in Italy and Flanders were divided, with Savoy receiving Sicily and parts of the Duchy of Milan. The former Spanish Netherlands, the Kingdom of Naples, Sardinia, and the bulk of the Duchy of Milan went to Emperor Charles VI. 

In South America, Spain returned Colónia do Sacramento in modern Uruguay to Portugal and recognised Portuguese sovereignty over the lands between the Amazon and Oyapock rivers, now in Brazil. The British agreed to prevent their citizens from visiting Spanish colonies in America without prior approval from colonial officials.

In North America, France recognised British suzerainty over the Iroquois, and ceded Nova Scotia and its claims to Newfoundland and territories in Rupert&#x27;s Land. The French portion of Saint Kitts in the West Indies was also ceded in its entirety to Britain. France retained its other pre-war North American possessions, including Cape Breton Island, where it built the Fortress of Louisbourg, then the most expensive military installation in North America.

The successful French Rhineland campaign of 1713 finally induced Charles to sign the 1714 treaties of Rastatt and Baden, although terms were not agreed with Spain until the 1720 Treaty of The Hague.

==Responses to the treaties==

The treaty&#x27;s territorial provisions did not go as far as the Whigs in Britain would have liked, considering that the French had made overtures for peace in 1706 and again in 1709. The Whigs considered themselves the heirs of the staunch anti-French policies of William III of England and the John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. The Whigs were now a minority in the house, but still pushing their anti-peace agenda. The whigs opposed peace every step of the way. The Whigs even called the treaty a sellout for letting the duke of Anjou stay on the Spanish throne.

However, in the Parliament of 1710 the Tories had gained control of the House of Commons, and they wished for an end to Great Britain&#x27;s participation in a European war. Queen Anne and her advisors had also come to agree.

The party in the administration of Robert Harley (created Earl of Oxford and Mortimer on 23 May 1711) and the Viscount Bolingbroke proved more flexible at the bargaining table and were characterized by the Whigs as &quot;pro-French&quot;; Oxford and Bolingbroke persuaded the Queen to create twelve new &quot;Tory peers&quot; to ensure ratification of the treaty in the House of Lords. The opponents of the treaty tried to rally support under the slogan of &quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot;.

Although the fate of the Spanish Netherlands in particular was of interest to the United Provinces, Dutch influence on the outcome of the negotiations was fairly insignificant, even though the talks were held on their territory. The French negotiator Melchior de Polignac taunted the Dutch with the scathing remark &quot;de vous, chez vous, sans vous&quot;, meaning that negotiations would be held &quot;about you, around you, without you&quot;. The fact that Bolingbroke had secretly ordered the British commander, the Duke of Ormonde, to withdraw from the Allied forces before the Battle of Denain (informing the French but not the Allies), and the fact that they secretly arrived at separate peace with France was a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, made the objections of the Allies pointless. In any case, the Dutch achieved their condominium in the Austrian Netherlands with the Austro-Dutch Barrier Treaty of 1715.

==Aftermath==
The Treaty stipulated that &quot;because of the great danger which threatened the liberty and safety of all Europe, from the too close conjunction of the kingdoms of Spain and France, ... one and the same person should never become King of both kingdoms&quot;. Some historians argue this makes it a significant milestone in the evolution of the modern nation state and concept of a balance of power.

First mentioned in 1701 by Charles Davenant in his &quot;Essays on the Balance of Power&quot;, it was widely publicised in Britain by author and Tory satirist Daniel Defoe in his 1709 article &quot;A Review of the Affairs of France&quot;. The idea was reflected in the wording of the treaties and resurfaced after the defeat of Napoleon in the 1815 Concert of Europe that dominated Europe in the 19th century.

For the individual signatories, Britain established naval superiority over its competitors, commercial access to Spain and America, and control of Menorca and Gibraltar; it retains the latter territory to this day. France accepted the Protestant succession on the British throne, ensuring a smooth transition when Anne died in August 1714, and ended its support for the Stuarts under the 1716 Anglo-French Treaty. While the war left all participants with unprecedented levels of government debt, only Great Britain successfully financed it.
Spain retained the majority of its Empire and recovered remarkably quickly; the recapture of Naples and Sicily in 1718 was only prevented by British naval power and a second attempt was successful in 1734. The 1707, 1715 and 1716 &quot;Nueva Planta&quot; decrees abolished regional political structures in the kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca and the Principality of Catalonia, although Catalonia and Aragon retained some of these rights until 1767.

Despite failure in Spain, Austria secured its position in Italy and Hungary, allowing it to continue expansion into areas of South-East Europe previously held by the Ottoman Empire. Even after paying expenses associated with the Dutch Barrier, increased tax revenues from the Austrian Netherlands funded a significant upgrade of the Austrian military. However, these gains were diminished by various factors, chiefly the disruption of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 caused by Charles disinheriting his nieces in favour of his daughter Maria Theresa.

Attempts to ensure its succession involved Austria in wars of little strategic value; much of the fighting in the 1733–1735 War of the Polish Succession taking place in its maritime provinces in Italy. Austria had traditionally relied on naval support from the Dutch, whose own capability had been severely degraded; Britain prevented the loss of Sicily and Naples in 1718 but refused to do so again in 1734. The dispute continued to loosen Habsburg control over the Empire; Bavaria, Hanover, Prussia and Saxony increasingly acted as independent powers and in 1742, Charles of Bavaria became the first non-Habsburg Emperor in over 300 years.

The Dutch Republic ended the war effectively bankrupt, while the damage suffered by the Dutch merchant navy permanently affected their commercial and political strength and it was superseded by Britain as the pre-eminent European mercantile power. The acquisition of the Barrier Fortresses however became an important asset of Dutch foreign policy and enlarged their sphere of influence. Although judged favourably by contemporaries, it was later argued that the barrier proved to be largely illusory when put to the test during the War of Austrian Succession. The Dutch had in any case successfully defended their positions in the Southern Netherlands and their troops were central in the alliance which halted French territorial expansion in Europe until a new cycle began in 1792.

While the final settlement at Utrecht was far more favourable to France than the Allied offer of 1709 had been, it gained little that had not already been achieved through diplomacy by February 1701. Though France remained a great power, concern at its relative decline in military and economic terms compared to Britain was an underlying cause of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740.

<text>is a landlocked prefecture of Japan located in the Kantō region of Honshu. Tochigi Prefecture has a population of 1,897,649 (1 June 2023) and has a geographic area of 6,408 km² (2,474 sq mi). Tochigi Prefecture borders Fukushima Prefecture to the north, Gunma Prefecture to the west, Saitama Prefecture to the south, and Ibaraki Prefecture to the southeast.

Utsunomiya is the capital and largest city of Tochigi Prefecture, with other major cities including Oyama, Tochigi, and Ashikaga. Tochigi Prefecture is one of only eight landlocked prefectures and its mountainous northern region is a popular tourist region in Japan. The Nasu area is known for its onsens, local sake, and ski resorts, the villa of the Imperial Family, and the station of the Shinkansen railway line. The city of Nikkō, with its ancient Shintō shrines and Buddhist temples, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Prefectural overview ==
Situated among the inland prefectures of the northern part of the Kantō region, Tochigi is contiguous with Ibaraki, Gunma, Saitama, and Fukushima Prefectures.

The climate of Tochigi may be classified as a humid temperate zone with broad variations in temperature. Winters are arid with dry winds, while summers are humid with frequent thunderstorms.

The population of Tochigi as of November 2010 is approximately 2,005,096.

Located in the center of the prefecture is the largest open plain in the Kantō region. Shirane (), Nantai () and Nasudake () mountain are in the northern part of the area. Kinugawa, Nakagawa, and Watarase River originate in this region, which flow across the Kanto plain before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. Tochigi is the 20th largest prefecture in Japan with a total area of 6,408.09 square km.

As of 1 April 2012, 21% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely Nikkō National Park, Oze National Park, and eight Prefectural Natural Parks.

== History ==
Before the Meiji Restoration, Tochigi was known as Shimotsuke Province.

In the early 15th century, the Ashikaga Gakkō, Japan&#x27;s oldest school of higher education, was re-established in the prefecture, holding over 3,000 students by the 16th century. Saint Francis Xavier introduced Ashikaga to the world as the best university in Japan.

In the early 17th century, Japan was unified under the shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu. After his death, the Nikko Tōshō-gū shrine was built in Nikkō in 1617 on what the shōguns thought of as holy ground to protect and worship Ieyasu. Its establishment brought Nikkō to national attention. Ieyasu&#x27;s successors as Tokugawa shogun developed the Nikkō Kaidō (日光街道, part of the major road connecting Nikkō with Edo) and acquired lavish processions to worship Ieyasu. 

In the late 19th century, the Tokugawa shogunate fell and the new government established the prefectures. The prefectural capital was established in the city of Tochigi after the unification of Utsunomiya Prefecture and Tochigi Prefecture in 1873. By 1884, however, the capital was transferred to Utsunomiya.

In March 2011, following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, levels of radioactivity in Utsunomiya were 33 times higher than normal.

== Geography ==
The chief city of Utsunomiya is famous for its many gyoza specialist shops. Also located in Utsunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture has one of the largest shopping malls in the North Kantō region, Bell Mall.

<text>The Peace of Ryswick, or Rijswijk, was a series of treaties signed in the Dutch city of Rijswijk between 20 September and 30 October 1697. They ended the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years&#x27; War between France and the Grand Alliance, which included the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire.

One of a series of wars fought by Louis XIV of France between 1666 and 1714, neither side was able to make significant territorial gains. By 1695, the huge financial costs, coupled with widespread famine and economic dislocation, meant both sides needed peace. Negotiations were delayed by the question of who would inherit the Spanish Empire from the childless and terminally ill Charles II of Spain, the closest heirs being Louis and Emperor Leopold I.

Since Louis could not impose his preferred solution, he refused to discuss the issue, while Leopold refused to sign without its inclusion. He finally did so with great reluctance on 30 October 1697, but the Peace was generally viewed as a truce; Charles&#x27; death in 1700 led to the War of the Spanish Succession.

In Europe and North America, the terms essentially restored the position prevailing before the war, though Spain recognized French control of the island of Tortuga and the western portion of Hispaniola (Saint-Domingue). In Europe, France evacuated several territories it had occupied since the 1679 Treaty of Nijmegen, including Freiburg, Breisach and the Duchy of Lorraine; conversely, it retained Strasbourg.

==Background==

The Nine Years&#x27; War was financially crippling for its participants, partly because armies increased in size from an average of 25,000 in 1648 to over 100,000 by 1697. This was unsustainable for pre-industrial economies; the war absorbed 80% of English state revenue in the period, while the huge manpower commitments badly affected the economy.

The 1690s also marked the coldest point of the so-called Little Ice Age, a period of cold and wet weather affecting Europe in the second half of the 17th century. Harvests failed throughout Europe in 1695, 1696, 1698 and 1699; in Scotland and parts of Northern Europe, an estimated 5–15% of the population starved to death.

Although fighting largely ended in Europe after 1695, the subsidiary conflict known as King William&#x27;s War continued in the Americas. A French fleet arrived in the Caribbean in early 1697, threatening the Spanish treasure fleet, and English possessions in the West Indies. England occupied the French colony of Acadia, while the French repulsed attacks on Quebec, captured York Factory, and caused substantial damage to the New England economy.

==Negotiations==
Talks were dominated by the primary issue of European politics for the last 30 years: the Spanish inheritance. By 1696, it was clear Charles II of Spain would die childless, and his potential heirs included King Louis XIV of France and Emperor Leopold I. The Spanish Empire remained a vast global confederation; in addition to Spain, its territories included large parts of Italy, the Spanish Netherlands, the Philippines, and much of the Americas. Acquisition of these territories by either France or Austria would change the European balance of power.

Recognising he was not strong enough to impose his preferred solution to the Spanish question, Louis wanted to prevent its discussion, by dividing the Grand Alliance and isolating Leopold. In the 1696 Treaty of Turin he made a separate peace with the Duchy of Savoy. Other concessions were the return of the Duchy of Luxemburg to Spain; considerably larger than the modern state, it was essential to Dutch security. Louis also agreed to recognise William III as monarch of England and Scotland, rather than the exiled James II.

Formal discussions between the delegations were held in the Huis ter Nieuwburg at Ryswick, mediated by Swedish diplomat and soldier . Many members of the Empire, such as Baden and Bavaria, sent representatives, although they were not party to the treaties.
Talks proceeded slowly; Leopold habitually avoided making decisions until absolutely necessary, and since the terms failed to address the inheritance question, he would only agree to a ceasefire. One of the Spanish negotiators, Bernardo de Quiros, ignored instructions from Madrid to make peace at any price, and agreed to support this demand. Although the British initially preferred to continue fighting, William became anxious to finalise peace. William and Louis appointed the Earl of Portland and Marshal Louis-François de Boufflers as their personal representatives; they met privately outside Brussels in June 1697, and quickly finalised terms, with de Quiros being overruled.

The peace consisted of a number of separate agreements: on 20 September 1697, France signed &quot;Treaties of Peace&quot; with Spain and England, a &quot;Ceasefire&quot; with the Holy Roman Empire, and on 21 September, a &quot;Treaty of Peace and Commerce&quot; with the Dutch Republic. When Charles fell seriously ill, Leopold used it as an excuse to delay signing; one frustrated negotiator claimed &quot;it would be a shorter way to knock (Charles) on the head, rather than all Europe be kept in suspense.&quot; The Spanish king recovered, while William threatened to dissolve the Alliance if Leopold did not sign before 1 November; he finally did so on 30 October.

== Treaties ==

==Provisions==
The treaty essentially restored the map of Western Europe to that agreed by the 1679 Treaty of Nijmegen; France kept Strasbourg, the strategic key to Alsace, but returned other territories occupied or captured since then, including Freiburg, Breisach, Philippsburg and the Duchy of Lorraine to the Holy Roman Empire. French forces also evacuated Catalonia, Luxembourg, Mons and Kortrijk in the Spanish Netherlands. Louis recognised William as king, withdrew support from the Jacobites, and abandoned claims to the Electorate of Cologne, and the Electoral Palatinate.

In North America, positions returned to those prevailing before the war, with France regaining Acadia, although in reality low-level conflict persisted around the boundaries. Conversely, in the Caribbean Spain recognized French control of the western portion of Hispaniola and the island of Tortuga; France had in fact established its colony of Saint-Domingue years earlier. Meanwhile, the Dutch returned the colony of Pondichéry in India to France.

==Aftermath==

All sides interpreted Ryswick to be a truce, and expected conflict to resume when Charles died. The war demonstrated that France could no longer impose its objectives without allies. Louis therefore adopted a dual approach of a diplomatic offensive to seek support, while keeping the French Army on a war footing. The increase in Habsburg power following victory in the Great Turkish War with the signing of the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 was offset by the growing independence of states like Bavaria, which looked to Louis, rather than Leopold, for support.

The war diverted resources from both the Dutch and French navies, and although the Dutch still dominated the Far East trade, Ryswick marked a turning point in England&#x27;s rise as a global maritime power. Previously focused on the Levant, its mercantile interests began challenging Spanish and Portuguese control of the Americas, where the French struggled to compete. The huge debts accumulated by the Dutch weakened their economy, while London replaced Amsterdam as the commercial centre of Europe. The Nine Years&#x27; War, together with the subsequent War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14), marked the end of the Dutch Golden Age.

At the same time, the determination of the Tory majority in Parliament to reduce costs meant that by 1699, the English army had been reduced to less than 7,000 men. This seriously undermined William&#x27;s ability to negotiate on equal terms with France, and despite his intense mistrust, he co-operated with Louis in an attempt to agree a diplomatic solution to the Spanish succession. The so-called Partition Treaties of The Hague in 1698 and London in 1700 ultimately failed to prevent the outbreak of war between the two kingdoms.

After the death of James II died in 1701, Louis XIV proclaimed Prince James, the former heir of James II, rightful king of England, despite the treaty.

<text>Mary Doria Russell (born August 19, 1950) is an American novelist.

==Early life and education==
Russell was born in Elmhurst, Illinois. 

She graduated from Glenbard East High School in Lombard, Illinois, which has registered its chapter of the National English Honor Society.

==Writing career==

=== Sparrow series ===

Russell&#x27;s first two novels, &quot;The Sparrow&quot; and its sequel &quot;Children of God&quot; (1998)—sometimes called the Sparrow series or Emilio Sandoz sequence—(Random House Villard in 1996 and 1998) have been called speculative fiction and focused on the religious and psychological implications of first contact with aliens. Both explore the problem of evil (theodicy) and how to reconcile a benevolent, omniscient, all-powerful deity with lives filled with undeserved suffering.

&quot;The Sparrow&quot; won the Arthur C. Clarke, BSFA, and Tiptree annual science fiction book awards (below), and it was the basis for Russell winning the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 1998. 

For &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;, chief editor John Clute calls Russell an &quot;author who established a strong reputation for cognitive subtlety and narrative power in her brief [science fiction] career; after the Emilio Sandoz sequence ... she turned her interest to other fields.&quot;

=== Other novels ===

The rest of Russell&#x27;s novels have been categorized as historical novels, although she draws from a variety of genres when telling these stories.

A Thread of Grace (Random House, 2005) is a World War II thriller set in Northern Italy and features both the Italian resistance movement and the plight of Jewish refugees escaping Nazi persecution throughout Europe. Much of the story is based on accounts by survivors from the period, when many Italian citizens allowed Jews to seek safe harbor in their farmlands, cities, and ports. (Russell herself is of Italian heritage and is a convert to Judaism.)

Dreamers of the Day (Random House, 2008) is a historical romance set in the Midwestern United States and the Middle East during the aftermath of the First World War and the Great Influenza. It focuses on the 1921 Cairo Peace Conference, when Winston Churchill, T. E. Lawrence, Gertrude Bell and a group of British oilmen invented the modern Middle East, thus setting the region up for a hundred years of war.

Doc (Random House 2011) is a murder mystery as well as a realistic and compassionate portrait of the notorious &quot;gambler and gunman&quot; known as Doc Holliday. Doc is set in Dodge City, Kansas, during 1878, the last year that Dr. John Henry Holliday&#x27;s tuberculosis was in check long enough for him to practice dentistry, a profession at which he excelled. The plot revolves around the mysterious death of a half-black, half-Indian boy who leaves a remarkable void in the life of the city. Doc was the American Library Association&#x27;s Top Pick in Historical Fiction as well as the Kansas State Library&#x27;s Notable Novel and the Great Lakes Great Reads pick.

Epitaph (Ecco/HarperCollins, 2015) picks up where Doc left off, following Holliday and the Earp brothers to Tombstone, Arizona, and traces the political and social roots of the infamous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, as well as the making of the mythology that surrounds it. Epitaph is deeply researched; in addition to thorough study of the history of those involved, the 60-year-old Russell rode 58 miles on horseback through the mountains surrounding Tombstone, retracing the Earp Vendetta Ride. The novel was called the best ever written on the subject by Earp biographer Allen Barra and was recognized by True West Magazine as the Best Historical Western of 2015. The Ohioana Library Foundation awarded it the Best Fiction Prize of 2016; it also won the Ohioana Readers Choice Award for the year.

The Women of the Copper Country (Atria Books, 2019) is a painstakingly researched novel about the Copper Country strike of 1913–1914, the first unionized strike against all the copper mines in the Copper Country of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. The central character, &quot;Big Annie&quot; Clements, is based on &quot;America&#x27;s Joan of Arc,&quot; Anna Clemenc, who founded the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary of the Western Federation of Miners and proudly carried the flag in many marches against the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company. Other historical figures, including James MacNaughton, General Manager of Calumet and Hecla, Woodbridge N. Ferris, governor of Michigan during the strike, and Mother Jones, prominent activist and union organizer, are also elaborately and credibly portrayed. The book received a Michigan Notable Book Award for 2020 from the Library of Michigan.

Russell is active on the lecture circuit, speaking at colleges, universities and libraries.

<text>Stella Dallas is a 1923 novel by Olive Higgins Prouty and published by Houghton Mifflin, written in response to the death of her three-year-old daughter from encephalitis. It tells the story of the eponymous protagonist, a working-class woman who marries a rich businessman but struggles to adapt to her new life. After the marriage fails, she sacrifices her own happiness for the sake of her daughter.

The novel was subsequently adapted into a stage play in 1924 and movies in 1925, 1937, and 1990. The 1937 King Vidor and Sam Goldwyn production brought Academy Award nominations to Barbara Stanwyck and Anne Shirley. The novel was also the basis for the radio serial &quot;Stella Dallas&quot;, which aired daily for 18 years as a soap opera. Prouty was reportedly displeased with her characters&#x27; portrayals therein.

<doc id="180967" wikidata="Q270627" url="?curid=180967" title="Colorado River (Argentina)">
<text>The Colorado River (, ) is a river in the center of Argentina.

The Colorado River marks most of the political boundary between the Argentine provinces of Neuquén and Mendoza, and between Rio Negro and La Pampa. Its man-made dam, &quot;Embalse Casa de Piedra,&quot; serves both to generate hydroelectricity for the arid region the river traverses, and to regulate the river&#x27;s water level.

==Course==
Its sources are on the eastern slopes of the Andes in the same latitude as the Chilean volcano Tinguiririca (about 34° 48&#x27; S.) and the river takes a generally east-southeast course toward the Atlantic Ocean. After leaving the vicinity of the Andes, the Colorado flows through a barren, arid territory, and receives no tributary of note except the Salado (or &quot;Curacó&quot;) from La Pampa Province—although it was once an outlet of the now-closed lake basin of Laguna Urre Lauquen. The bottom lands of the Colorado, in its course across Patagonia, are fertile and wooded, but too small in area to support more than a small, scattered population. The river ends about south of Bahía Blanca, through several channels of a delta of the &quot;Unión Bay&quot; extending from latitude 39° 30&#x27; to 39° 50&#x27; S. Its total length is about , of which about , from the coast up to Pichi Mahuida, are navigable for vessels of up to draft. It is nearly if calculated Río Desaguadero within.

==Naming==
The river has usually been described as formed by the confluence of the Grande and the Barrancas. However, since the Barrancas is only a small stream compared to the Grande, it is more accurate to describe the Barrancas as a tributary that joins the main river, which is known as the &quot;Grande&quot; above where the Barrancas joins it, and the &quot;Colorado&quot; below that point.

<text>The Colorado River () is one of the principal rivers (along with the Rio Grande) in the Southwestern United States and in northern Mexico. The river, the 5th longest in the United States, drains an expansive, arid watershed that encompasses parts of seven U.S. states and two Mexican states. The name Colorado derives from the Spanish language for &quot;colored reddish&quot; due to its heavy silt load. Starting in the central Rocky Mountains of Colorado, it flows generally southwest across the Colorado Plateau and through the Grand Canyon before reaching Lake Mead on the Arizona–Nevada border, where it turns south toward the international border. After entering Mexico, the Colorado approaches the mostly dry Colorado River Delta at the tip of the Gulf of California between Baja California and Sonora.

Known for its dramatic canyons, whitewater rapids, and eleven U.S. National Parks, the Colorado River and its tributaries are a vital source of water for 40 million people. An extensive system of dams, reservoirs, and aqueducts divert almost its entire flow for agricultural irrigation and urban water supply. Its large flow and steep gradient are used to generate hydroelectricity, meeting peaking power demands in much of the Intermountain West. Intensive water consumption has dried up the lower of the river, which has rarely reached the sea since the 1960s.

Native Americans have inhabited the Colorado River basin for at least 8,000 years. Starting around 1 CE, large agriculture-based societies were established, but a combination of drought and poor land use practices led to their collapse in the 1300s. Their descendants include tribes such as the Puebloans, while others including the Navajo settled in the Colorado Basin after the 1000s. In the 1500s, Spanish explorers began mapping and claiming the watershed, which became part of Mexico upon winning its independence from Spain in 1821. Even after most of the watershed became US territory in 1846, much of the river&#x27;s course remained unknown. Several expeditions charted the Colorado in the mid-19th century—one of which, led by John Wesley Powell, was the first to run the rapids of the Grand Canyon. Large-scale settlement of the lower basin began in the mid- to late-1800s, with steamboats sailing from the Gulf of California to landings along the river that linked to wagon roads to the interior. Starting in the 1860s, gold and silver strikes drew prospectors to the upper Colorado River basin.

Large-scale river management began in the early 1900s, with major guidelines established in a series of international and US interstate treaties known as the &quot;Law of the River&quot;. The US federal government constructed most of the major dams and aqueducts between 1910 and 1970; the largest, Hoover Dam, was completed in 1935. Numerous water projects have also involved state and local governments. With all of their waters fully allocated, both the Colorado and the neighboring Rio Grande are now considered among the most controlled and litigated river systems in the world. Since 2000, extended drought has conflicted with increasing demands for Colorado River water, and the level of human development and control of the river continues to generate controversy.

==Course==
The Colorado begins at La Poudre Pass in the Never Summer Mountains in Rocky Mountain National Park, above sea level. After a short run south, the river turns west below Grand Lake, the largest natural lake in the state. For the first of its course, the Colorado carves its way through the mountainous Western Slope, a sparsely populated region defined by the portion of the state west of the Continental Divide. As it flows southwest, it gains strength from many small tributaries, as well as larger ones including the Blue, Eagle and Roaring Fork rivers. After passing through De Beque Canyon, the Colorado emerges from the Rockies into the Grand Valley, a major farming and ranching region where it meets one of its largest tributaries, the Gunnison River, at Grand Junction. Most of the upper river is a swift whitewater stream ranging from wide, the depth ranging from , with a few notable exceptions, such as the Blackrocks reach where the river is nearly deep. In a few areas, such as the marshy Kawuneeche Valley near the headwaters and the Grand Valley, it exhibits braided characteristics.

From Grand Junction, the Colorado turns northwest before cutting southwest across the eponymous Colorado Plateau, a vast area of high desert centered at the Four Corners of the southwestern United States. Here, the climate becomes significantly drier than that in the Rocky Mountains, and the river becomes entrenched in progressively deeper gorges of bare rock, beginning with Ruby Canyon and then Westwater Canyon as it enters Utah, now once again heading southwest. Farther downstream it receives the Dolores River and defines the southern border of Arches National Park, before passing Moab and flowing through &quot;The Portal&quot;, where it exits the Moab Valley between a pair of sandstone cliffs.
In Utah, the Colorado flows primarily through the &quot;slickrock&quot; country, which is characterized by its narrow canyons and unique &quot;folds&quot; created by the tilting of sedimentary rock layers along faults. This is one of the most inaccessible regions of the continental United States. Below the confluence with the Green River, its largest tributary, in Canyonlands National Park, the Colorado enters Cataract Canyon, named for its dangerous rapids, and then Glen Canyon, known for its arches and erosion-sculpted Navajo sandstone formations. Here, the San Juan River, carrying runoff from the southern slope of Colorado&#x27;s San Juan Mountains, joins the Colorado from the east. The Colorado then enters northern Arizona, where since the 1960s Glen Canyon Dam near Page has flooded the Glen Canyon reach of the river, forming Lake Powell for hydroelectricity generation.

In Arizona, the river passes Lee&#x27;s Ferry, an important crossing for early explorers and settlers and since the early 20th century the principal point where Colorado River flows are measured for apportionment to the seven U.S. and two Mexican states in the basin. Downstream, the river enters Marble Canyon, the beginning of the Grand Canyon, passing under the Navajo Bridges on a now southward course. Below the confluence with the Little Colorado River, the river swings west into Granite Gorge, the most dramatic portion of the Grand Canyon, where the river cuts up to into the Colorado Plateau, exposing some of the oldest visible rocks on Earth, dating as long ago as 2 billion years. The of the river that flow through the Grand Canyon are largely encompassed by Grand Canyon National Park and are known for their difficult whitewater, separated by pools that reach up to in depth.

At the lower end of Grand Canyon, the Colorado widens into Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the continental United States, formed by Hoover Dam on the border of Arizona and Nevada. Situated southeast of metropolitan Las Vegas, the dam is an integral component for management of the Colorado River, controlling floods and storing water for farms and cities in the lower Colorado River basin. Below the dam the river passes under the Mike O&#x27;Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge—which at nearly above the water is the highest concrete arch bridge in the Western Hemisphere—and then turns due south towards Mexico, defining the Arizona–Nevada and Arizona–California borders.
After leaving the confines of the Black Canyon, the river emerges from the Colorado Plateau into the Lower Colorado River Valley (LCRV), a desert region dependent on irrigation agriculture and tourism and also home to several major Indian reservations. The river widens here to a broad, moderately deep waterway averaging wide and reaching up to across, with depths ranging from . Before channelization of the Colorado in the 20th century, the lower river was subject to frequent course changes caused by seasonal flow variations. Joseph C. Ives, who surveyed the lower river in 1861, wrote that &quot;the shifting of the channel, the banks, the islands, the bars is so continual and rapid that a detailed description, derived from the experiences of one trip, would be found incorrect, not only during the subsequent year, but perhaps in the course of a week, or even a day.&quot;

The LCRV is one of the most densely populated areas along the river, and there are numerous towns including Bullhead City, Arizona, Needles, California, and Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Here, several large diversions draw from the river, providing water for both local uses and distant regions including the Salt River Valley of Arizona and metropolitan Southern California. The last major U.S. diversion is at Imperial Dam, where over 90 percent of the river&#x27;s flow is moved into the Gila Gravity Canal and Yuma Area Project, and the much bigger All-American Canal to irrigate California&#x27;s Imperial Valley, the most productive winter agricultural region in the United States.

Below Imperial Dam, only a small portion of the Colorado River makes it beyond Yuma, Arizona, and the confluence with the intermittent Gila River—which carries runoff from western New Mexico and most of Arizona–before defining of the Mexico–United States border. At Morelos Dam, the entire remaining flow of the Colorado is diverted to irrigate the Mexicali Valley, among Mexico&#x27;s most fertile agricultural lands. Below San Luis Río Colorado, the Colorado passes entirely into Mexico, defining the Baja California–Sonora border. Since 1960, the stretch of the Colorado between here and the Gulf of California has been dry or a trickle formed by irrigation return flows. The Hardy River provides most of the flow into the Colorado River Delta, a vast alluvial floodplain covering about of northwestern Mexico. A large estuary is formed here before the Colorado empties into the Gulf about south of Yuma. Occasionally the International Boundary and Water Commission allows a springtime pulse flow to recharge the delta.

Before 20th-century development dewatered the lower Colorado, a major tidal bore was present in the delta and estuary; the first historical record was made by the Croatian missionary in Spanish service Father Ferdinand Konščak on July 18, 1746. During spring tide conditions, the tidal bore—locally called &quot;El Burro&quot;—formed in the estuary about Montague Island in Baja California and propagated upstream.

===Major tributaries===

The Colorado is joined by over 25 significant tributaries, of which the Green River is the largest by both length and discharge. The Green River takes drainage from the Wind River Range of west-central Wyoming, from Utah&#x27;s Uinta Mountains, and from the Rockies of northwestern Colorado. The Gila River is the second longest and drains a greater area than the Green, but has a significantly lower flow because of a more arid climate and larger diversions for irrigation and cities. Both the Gunnison and San Juan rivers, which derive most of their water from Rocky Mountains snowmelt, contribute more water than the Gila contributed naturally.

==Drainage basin==

The Colorado River Basin consists of , making it the seventh largest drainage basin in North America. About , or 97 percent of the basin, is in the United States. The basin extends into western Colorado and New Mexico, southwestern Wyoming, eastern and southern Utah, southeastern Nevada and California, and most of Arizona. The areas drained within Baja California and Sonora in Mexico are very small and do not contribute significant runoff. Aside from the Colorado River Delta, the basin extends into Sonora at a few locations further east, including the headwaters of the Santa Cruz River and San Pedro River (both tributaries of the Gila River). For hydrological management purposes, the Colorado River Basin is divided into the Upper Basin (the drainage area above Lees Ferry), and the Lower Basin. The Upper Basin covers only 45 percent of the land area of the Colorado River Basin, but contributes 92 percent of the runoff.

The entire eastern boundary of the Colorado River Basin runs along the North American Continental Divide and is defined largely by the Rocky Mountains and the Rio Grande Basin. The Wind River Range in Wyoming marks the northern extent of the basin, and is separated from the Colorado Rockies by the endorheic Great Divide Basin in southwestern Wyoming. Streams that are nearby the east side of the divide drain into the Mississippi River and Rio Grande, while nearby areas north of the Wind River Range drain into the Columbia River. The western boundary of the Colorado River Basin is formed by various ranges and plateaus that border the Great Basin, including the Uinta Mountains and Wasatch Range. Major Great Basin watersheds bordering the Colorado River Basin are the Great Salt Lake and Sevier Lake watersheds. To the south, the Colorado River Basin borders several watersheds in Mexico draining into the Gulf of California, including the Sonoyta, Concepción, and Yaqui rivers. Much of the basin is at high elevation; the mean elevation is . Lees Ferry, more than halfway along the Colorado River from its source, is above sea level. The highest point in the Colorado River Basin is Uncompahgre Peak in Colorado&#x27;s San Juan Mountains, while some water from the river drains via irrigation run-off into California&#x27;s Salton Sea, below sea level.
About 72 percent of the Colorado River Basin is classified as arid, with the Sonoran and Mojave deserts covering the southern portion and the Colorado Plateau encompassing much of the central portion. The Colorado Plateau is home to most of the major canyon systems formed by the Colorado River and its tributaries, particularly those of the Green and San Juan rivers. About 23 percent of the basin is forest, with the largest area in the Rocky Mountains; other significant forested areas include the Kaibab, Aquarius, and Markagunt plateaus in southern Utah and northern Arizona, and the Mogollon Rim in central Arizona. These high plateaus and escarpments, often exceeding in elevation, form the northern and southern edges of the Colorado Plateau geological province. Developed land use in the basin is mostly irrigated agriculture, chiefly in the Grand Valley, the Lower Colorado River Valley, and the Salt River Valley, but the total area of crop and pasture land is only 2–3 percent of the entire basin. Urban areas cover less than 1 percent.

Climate in the Colorado River Basin ranges from subtropical hot desert at southern, lower elevations to alpine in the Rocky Mountains. Mean monthly high temperatures are in the Upper Basin and in the Lower Basin, and lows average , respectively. Annual precipitation averages , ranging from over in some areas of the Rockies to less than in dry desert valleys. The Upper Basin generally receives snow and rain during the winter and early spring, while precipitation in the Lower Basin falls mainly during intense but infrequent summer thunderstorms brought on by the North American Monsoon. Precipitation is influenced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) with El Niño being associated with wetter conditions and La Niña with drier conditions. The effect of ENSO is significantly more pronounced in the Lower Basin, where it has a strong impact on monsoonal rainfall. Runoff patterns across the Colorado River Basin reflect this; most of the perennial tributaries originate in the Upper Basin, while tributaries in the Lower Basin are either ephemeral (such as the Little Colorado River) or highly seasonal (such as the Gila and Salt rivers).

As of 2010, approximately 13 million people lived within the Colorado River basin, while about 40 million people live in areas supplied by Colorado River water. Colorado River basin states are among the fastest-growing in the US; the population of Nevada alone increased by about 66 percent between 1990 and 2000 as Arizona grew by some 40 percent. Phoenix, Arizona, Las Vegas, Nevada and Mexicali, Baja California are the largest cities by population within the Colorado River Basin. Other significant cities include Tucson, Arizona, St. George, Utah and Flagstaff, Arizona. Due to the rugged and inhospitable topography through which the river flows, there are only a few major towns along the Colorado River itself, including Grand Junction, Colorado and Yuma, Arizona.

==Discharge==
The unimpaired annual runoff of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry, Arizona is estimated at , or an annualized discharge of , for the 1906–2023 period. River flows at the Lees Ferry stream gauge, about halfway along the length of the Colorado and below Glen Canyon Dam, are used to determine water allocations in the Colorado River basin. Flows originating above Lees Ferry represent the majority of Colorado River runoff. Tributaries between there and Imperial Dam near the US–Mexico border contribute a further , and the Gila–Salt River system historically accounted for another . While much of this water was lost to evaporation in the deserts of the Lower Basin, anywhere from per year reached the Colorado River Delta prior to the early 20th century.

Up to 90 percent of the river&#x27;s flow originates as snowmelt from the Rocky Mountains and other smaller mountain ranges of the Colorado Plateau. Natural seasonal flows at its mouth varied widely, often exceeding in the spring melt and falling as low as in winter. Snowmelt typically begins in April, peaks in May or June, and can extend into August in wet years. Monsoon rainstorms often occur in the Lower Basin from August through October, contributing much of the flow in tributaries below Lees Ferry and often causing flash flooding. Since the initial closure of Hoover Dam in 1934, lower Colorado River flows have been greatly moderated, with monthly means below the dam ranging from in May to in October. Upstream of the massive Hoover and Glen Canyon Dams, inflows to Lake Powell still experience distinct spring highs and winter lows, though overall volumes have been reduced due to Upper Basin water diversions. Flow regimes in a few Upper Basin tributaries, such as the Yampa River, remain almost completely unaltered.

By the 1950s, the Colorado delta was regularly drying up in fall and winter, though spring high flows often still made it to the ocean. After the initial closure of Glen Canyon Dam in 1963, these seasonal flows were almost completely eliminated, with the exception of a few very wet years, such as 1983–1987. In 1984, of excess runoff reached the ocean. Flows have further declined due to evaporation from reservoirs and, particularly after 2000, reduced snowpack with warming winter temperatures in the Rockies. Water diversions have effectively removed some tributaries entirely, including the Gila River, once the Colorado&#x27;s largest tributary below Lees Ferry. Most Colorado River water is diverted in the United States, with only about per year reaching Mexico since 1950. At Morelos Dam, the remaining flow is diverted to irrigate the Mexicali Valley, leaving the Colorado River Delta almost entirely dry except for small amounts of agricultural wastewater. 

==Geology==
As recently as the Cretaceous period about 100 million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 50 and 75 million years ago in a mountain-building episode known as the Laramide orogeny. The Colorado River first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River, once a tributary of the Mississippi River, west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20 million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up, which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34 million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5 million years ago, about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.

The time scale and sequence over which the river&#x27;s present course and the Grand Canyon were formed is uncertain. Before the Gulf of California was formed around 12 to 5 million years ago by faulting processes along the boundary of the North American and Pacific plates, the Colorado flowed west to an outlet on the Pacific Ocean—possibly Monterey Bay on the Central California coast, and may have played a role in the formation of the Monterey submarine canyon. Crustal extension in the Basin and Range Province began about 20 million years ago and the modern Sierra Nevada began forming about 10 million years ago, eventually diverting the Colorado southwards towards the Gulf. As the Colorado Plateau continued to rise between 5 and 2.5 million years ago, the river maintained its ancestral course (as an antecedent stream) and began to cut the Grand Canyon. Antecedence played a major part in shaping other peculiar geographic features in the watershed, including the Dolores River&#x27;s bisection of Paradox Valley in Colorado and the Green River&#x27;s cut through the Uinta Mountains in Utah.
Sediments carried from the plateau by the Colorado River created a vast delta made of more than of material that walled off the northernmost part of the gulf in approximately 1 million years. Cut off from the ocean, the portion of the gulf north of the delta eventually evaporated and formed the Salton Sink, which reached about below sea level. Since then the river has changed course into the Salton Sink at least three times, transforming it into Lake Cahuilla, which at maximum size flooded up the valley to present-day Indio, California. The lake took about 50 years to evaporate after the Colorado resumed flowing to the Gulf. The present-day Salton Sea can be considered the most recent incarnation of Lake Cahuilla, though on a much smaller scale.

Between 1.8 million and 10,000 years ago, massive flows of basalt from the Uinkaret volcanic field in northern Arizona dammed the Colorado River within the Grand Canyon. At least 13 lava dams were formed, the largest of which was more than high, backing the river up for nearly to present-day Moab, Utah. The lack of associated sediment deposits along this stretch of the Colorado River, which would have accumulated in the impounded lakes over time, suggests that most of these dams did not survive for more than a few decades before collapsing or being washed away. Failure of the lava dams caused by erosion, leaks and cavitation caused catastrophic floods, which may have been some of the largest ever to occur in North America, rivaling the late-Pleistocene Missoula Floods of the northwestern United States. Mapping of flood deposits indicate that crests as high as passed through the Grand Canyon, reaching peak discharges as great as .

==History==
===Pre-colonial indigenous peoples===

Small numbers of Paleo-Indians of the Clovis and Folsom cultures inhabited the Colorado Plateau as early as 10,000 BCE, with populations beginning to increase in the Desert Archaic period (6000 BCE–0 CE). While most early inhabitants were hunter-gatherers, evidence of agriculture, masonry dwellings and petroglyphs begins with the Fremont culture period (0–1300 CE). The Ancient Puebloan culture, also known as Anasazi or Hisatsinom, were descended from the Desert Archaic culture and became established in the Four Corners region around 1000 CE.

While there is much evidence of ancient habitation along the Colorado River, including stone dwellings, petroglyphs and pottery in places such as Glen Canyon, the first major agriculture-based societies arose a significant distance from the river. The Puebloan people built many multi-story pueblos or &quot;great houses&quot;, and developed complex distribution systems to supply drinking and irrigation water in Chaco Canyon in northwestern New Mexico and Mesa Verde in southwest Colorado. The Hohokam, present in the modern Phoenix area since about 0 CE, experienced prolific growth around 600–700 CE as they constructed a large system of irrigation canals making use of the Salt River. Both civilizations supported large populations at their height, with 6,000–15,000 in Chaco Canyon and as many as 30,000–200,000 Hohokam.

Puebloan and Hohokam settlements were abruptly abandoned in the 1400s CE, due both to over-exploitation of natural resources such as timber, and severe drought that made it impossible to maintain irrigation systems. Many Puebloans migrated east to the Rio Grande Valley, while others persisted in smaller settlements on the Colorado Plateau. Puebloan descendants include the Hopi, Zuni, Laguna and Acoma peoples of modern Arizona and New Mexico. O&#x27;odham peoples, including the Akimel O&#x27;odham (Pima) and Maricopa who continue to live in southern Arizona, are believed to be descended from the Hohokam. 

The lower Colorado River valley was inhabited for thousands of years by numerous tribes of the Patayan cultures, many of which belong to the Yuman-Cochimi language group. These include the Walapai, Havasupai and Yavapai in the Grand Canyon region; the Mohave, Halchidhoma, Quechan, and Halyikwamai along the Colorado River between Black Canyon and the Mexican border, and the Cocopah around the Colorado River Delta. The Chemehuevi (a branch of the Southern Paiute) and the Kumeyaay inhabited the desert to the river&#x27;s west. Those living along the lower Colorado River depended more on fishing and floodplain agriculture than on irrigation, and mostly did not live in permanent settlements. The site of modern-day Yuma has been an important river crossing since ancient times, as the channel here is much narrower compared to the expansive, swampy river bottoms to the north and south, and enabled the expansion of trade to the Pima and Maricopa in the east and coastal California tribes in the west.
The Navajo (Diné) began migrating into the Colorado River Basin around 1000–1500 CE, and eventually exercised influence over much of the Colorado Plateau. Originally hunter-gatherers, they acquired knowledge of farming from the Puebloans and adopted a more sedentary lifestyle over time, making extensive use of irrigation in their settlements. The Navajo gradually displaced Hopi settlements as they expanded into northern Arizona after the 1500s. Navajo Mountain and Rainbow Bridge in the Glen Canyon area came to hold particular religious significance for the Navajo, and the nearby confluence of the Colorado and San Juan River is regarded as the birthplace of clouds and rain.

The Ute also became established in the Colorado Plateau around 1500 CE, although they had inhabited more northerly parts of the Colorado basin (modern Wyoming and northern Colorado) since at least 0 CE. They are the first known inhabitants of this part of the Rocky Mountains, and made use of an extensive network of trails crisscrossing the mountains to move between summer and winter camps. The Ute were divided into numerous bands with separate territories but shared a common language and customs. The Uncompahgre or Tabeguache lived around the confluence of the upper Colorado and Gunnison Rivers, an area including the Grand Mesa; the Weenuchiu lived along the San Juan River, and the Parianuche and Yamparika lived in the Yampa, White and Duchesne River valleys. The Ute ranged as far as the river&#x27;s headwaters; one Ute story recounts a battle with the Arapaho at Grand Lake, which they believe still hosts the spirits of the deceased.

===Spanish exploration and early settlement===

Starting in the 1500s, the Spanish began to explore and colonize western North America. Francisco de Ulloa may have been the first European to see the river, when in 1536 he sailed to the head of the Gulf of California. In 1540 García López de Cárdenas became the first European to see the Grand Canyon, during Coronado&#x27;s expedition to find the Seven Cities of Gold (&quot;Cibola&quot;). Cárdenas was apparently unimpressed with the canyon, greatly underestimating its size, and left in disappointment with no gold to be found. In the same year Melchior Díaz explored the Colorado River&#x27;s delta and named it &quot;Rio del Tizon&quot; (&quot;fire brand river&quot;), after seeing a practice used by the local people for warming themselves. 

By the late 1500s or early 1600s, the Utes had acquired horses from the Spanish, and their use for hunting, trade and warfare soon became widespread among Utes and Navajo in the Colorado River basin. This conferred them a military advantage over Goshutes and Southern Paiutes that were slower to adopt horses. The Navajo also adopted a culture of livestock herding as they acquired sheep and goats from the Spanish. Juan Bautista de Anza in 1774 was the first Spaniard to reach Yuma Crossing, where he established friendly relations with the Quechan people and opened the Anza trail between Arizona and the California coast. The Spanish soon founded Mission Puerto de Purisima Concepcion and Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicuner along the lower Colorado River. However, Spanish attempts to control the crossing led to the 1781 Yuma revolt, in which over 100 soldiers and colonists were killed, and the settlements were abandoned. The Quechan blocked foreigners&#x27; use of the crossing until the arrival of American mountain men and fur trappers in the 1820s.

The name &quot;Rio Colorado&quot; first appears in 1701, on the map &quot;Paso por Tierra a la California&quot; published by missionary Eusebio Kino, who also determined during that time that Baja California was a peninsula, not an island as previously believed. In the 1700s and early 1800s many Spanish and American explorers believed in the existence of a Buenaventura River that ran from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast. In 1776, Silvestre Vélez de Escalante attached this name to the upper Green River, and a number of later maps showed this connecting to Lake Timpanogos (now Utah Lake) and flowing west to California. The Dominguez–Escalante expedition first reached the Colorado River near the junction with the Dolores River, naming the larger river &quot;Rio San Rafael&quot;. They later forded the Colorado in southeastern Utah at Crossing of the Fathers, now submerged in Lake Powell.
===American exploration===

In the 1820s, American fur trappers along the upper Green River in Wyoming (known to them as the &quot;Seedskeedee&quot; or variants thereof), seeking a route to export furs to the coast, surmised that this and what the Spanish called the Colorado were in fact connected. William H. Ashley made an unsuccessful attempt to navigate from the Green River to the Colorado&#x27;s mouth in 1825. In 1826, Jedediah Smith arrived at the lower Colorado River, referring to it as the Seedskeedee, and proceeded upstream, exploring as far as Black Canyon. During the 1830s, various fur trappers from Wyoming made it as far downstream as Cataract Canyon and Glen Canyon, but none were able to navigate the full length of the river. In 1843 John C. Frémont explored the Great Basin and conclusively determined no Buenaventura River flowed west to California; thus, the direction of river flow must be southwest.

By the early 19th century, the stretch of the Colorado above the confluence of the Green River at Cataract Canyon, Utah, became known to fur trappers as the &quot;Grand River&quot;, though the exact origin of this name is unknown. The Grand River above the confluence with the Gunnison River was also called the Bunkara River, the Blue River, or the North Fork of the Grand River until the 1870s. By the early 1900s the name &quot;Grand River&quot; had been attached to the entire stream as far as Grand Lake, which was then considered its official source. Although the Grand River was renamed the Colorado in 1921, its name survives in numerous places such as Grand County and Grand Junction, Colorado.

In 1848 the U.S. Army established Fort Yuma, creating the first permanent U.S. settlement along the river. This served as a military garrison and supply point for settlers headed to California along the Southern Emigrant Trail. Due to the arduous task of ferrying supplies overland, the schooner &quot;Invincible&quot; attempted to bring supplies up the river but was thwarted by the delta&#x27;s strong tides. Steamboats were brought to the river, starting in 1852 with the sidewheeler &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;, whose first voyage from the Gulf to Yuma took fifteen days. Exploration by steamboat soon advanced upriver. In 1857, George A. Johnson in the &quot;General Jesup&quot; was able to reach Pyramid Canyon, over north of Fort Yuma. He was followed by Lt. Joseph Christmas Ives who used a specially built shallow-draft steamboat, &quot;Explorer&quot;, to reach Black Canyon, where Hoover Dam stands today. Having set out to determine the river&#x27;s suitability as a navigation route, Ives remarked: &quot;Ours has been the first, and will doubtless be the last, party of whites to visit this profitless locality. It seems intended by nature that the Colorado River, along the greater portion of its lonely and majestic way, shall be forever unvisited and undisturbed.&quot;

The last part of the Colorado River to be surveyed was the Grand Canyon itself. In 1869, John Wesley Powell with nine men set out on an expedition from Green River Station, Wyoming. They were the first part of non-natives to travel the length of the Grand Canyon, and the first to successfully travel by boat from the upper Green River to the lower Colorado. Powell led a second expedition in 1871, with financial backing from the U.S. government, and continued to conduct geographical and botanical surveys across the region until the 1890s. Another Grand Canyon river expedition was led in 1889–1890 by Robert Brewster Stanton to survey a route for a proposed railroad through the canyon, which was never built.
===U.S. westward expansion and military campaigns===
In 1858, gold was discovered on the Gila River east of Yuma, then along the Colorado River at El Dorado Canyon, Nevada and La Paz, Arizona. As prospectors and settlers entered the region, they became involved in skirmishes with the Mohave, spurring U.S. Army expeditions that culminated in the 1859 Battle of the Colorado River which concluded the Mohave War. In the 1870s the Mohave were moved to the Fort Mohave and Colorado River reservations. Chemehuevi and later some Hopi and Navajo peoples were also moved to the Colorado River reservation, where they today form the Colorado River Indian Tribes.

As the American frontier expanded into the Colorado Plateau, an effort to expel the Navajo from the Four Corners region was begun by General James Henry Carleton, who in 1864 enlisted mountain man Kit Carson to lead a campaign against the Navajo. Carson, with the help of the Navajo&#x27;s Ute enemies, captured more than 8,000 Navajo and forcibly marched them to Fort Sumner, New Mexico. Hundreds died during what is now known as the Long Walk and while enduring appalling conditions at Fort Sumner. After the failure of the Army to maintain the reservation there, the Treaty of Bosque Redondo established the Navajo Nation in the Four Corners, where the Navajo were allowed to return in 1868.

Gold and silver were also discovered in the Upper Basin, beginning with the 1859 Blue River strike that led to the founding of Breckenridge, Colorado. Up until the 1860s, southwestern Colorado had remained relatively untouched by U.S. westward expansion, as the Americans had recognized Ute sovereignty by treaty. Following the 1861 carving out of Colorado Territory and further mineral strikes including Ouray and Telluride, Ute leaders were coerced into signing the 1873 Brunot Agreement, in which they lost rights to most of their land. A flood of mineral prospecting and settlement ensued in western Colorado. By 1881, the Army had driven out the remaining pockets of Ute resistance on the Western Slope, officially opening the Grand River country to settlement, and the town of Grand Junction was incorporated a year later. The Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&amp;RGW) quickly expanded into this area to serve mining boomtowns, crossing the Rockies to the south via the Black Canyon of the Gunnison River. By 1883 the railroad had reached Grand Junction, and a spur up the Colorado to Glenwood Springs was completed in 1887.

In Arizona and Utah Territories, many early settlers were Mormons fleeing religious persecution in the Midwest. Mormons founded agricultural colonies at Fort Santa Clara in 1855 and St. Thomas, now flooded under Lake Mead, in 1865. Stone&#x27;s Ferry, crossing the Colorado at the mouth of the Virgin River, enabled shipping of their produce by wagon to gold mining districts further south. Although the Mormons abandoned St. Thomas in 1871, a salt-mining industry persisted here, and steamboats operated up to nearby Rioville into the 1880s. In 1879 a group of Mormon settlers made their way to southeastern Utah, blasting the precarious Hole in the Rock Trail to cross the Colorado River at Glen Canyon, subsequently establishing the community of Bluff. Due to the dry climate, these settlements depended heavily on irrigation. In central Arizona, settlers uncovered and re-established canals previously used by the Hohokam.

Following tensions between Mormon settlers and the U.S. government in the Utah War, a local militia including John D. Lee perpetrated the 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre, in which 120 non-Mormon settlers were killed. Fearing retribution, Lee moved in 1870 to the remote Pahreah Crossing in Arizona, where he took over a ferry first established in 1864 by Jacob Hamblin. This, the only river crossing for hundreds of miles not hemmed in by vertical canyon walls, became known as Lee&#x27;s Ferry. While Lee was tried and subsequently executed in 1877, the ferry remained a major transportation link until the Navajo Bridge was completed nearby in 1928, rendering the ferry obsolete.

The Denver and Salt Lake Railway (D&amp;SL), incorporated in 1902, sought to provide a more direct connection between Denver and Salt Lake City than either the transcontinental railroad through Wyoming or the D&amp;RGW&#x27;s route via Black Canyon and Durango. The D&amp;SL completed a rail line into the upper headwaters of the Colorado River and blasted the Moffat Tunnel under the Continental Divide, but ran out of money before even reaching Utah. In 1931 the D&amp;RGW completed the &quot;Dotsero Cutoff&quot; linking Glenwood Springs to the D&amp;SL route at Bond, Colorado, finally completing the direct Denver–Salt Lake link with its acquisition of the bankrupt D&amp;SL. The Gunnison River route was eventually abandoned in favor of the shorter Colorado River route, which today is owned by Union Pacific.

===Renaming of the upper Colorado River===
As late as 1921, the Colorado River upstream from the confluence with the Green River in Utah was still known as the Grand River. For over a decade, U.S. Representative Edward T. Taylor of Colorado had petitioned the Congressional Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce to rename the Grand River as the Colorado River. Representatives from Wyoming, Utah, and the United States Geological Survey objected, noting that the Green River was longer and drained a larger area. Taylor argued that the Grand River should be considered the main stream, as it carried the larger volume of water. Taylor felt &quot;slighted&quot; that the Colorado River, as named, did not begin in the state of Colorado, and &quot;he wasn&#x27;t going to let Utah or Wyoming lay claim to the river&#x27;s headwaters, despite the fact that the Green River is the larger drainage basin.&quot; On July 25, 1921, President Warren G. Harding signed House Joint Resolution 32 - &quot;To change the name of the Grand River in Colorado and Utah to the Colorado River.&quot; 

==Engineering and development==

About 40 million people depend on the Colorado River&#x27;s water for agricultural, industrial and domestic needs. The Colorado irrigates 5.5 million acres (2.2 million hectares) of farmland, and its hydroelectric plants produce 12 billion kilowatt hours (KWh) of hydroelectricity each year. Hydroelectricity from the Colorado is a key supplier of peaking power on the Southwest electric grid. Often called &quot;America&#x27;s Nile&quot;, the Colorado is so intensively managed that each drop of its water is used an average of 17 times in a single year. Southern Nevada Water Authority has called the Colorado River one of the &quot;most controlled, controversial and litigated rivers in the world&quot;.
In 1922, six U.S. states signed the Colorado River Compact, which divided half of the river&#x27;s flow to both the Upper Basin (the drainage area above Lee&#x27;s Ferry, comprising parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming and a small portion of Arizona) and the Lower Basin (Arizona, California, Nevada, and parts of New Mexico and Utah). The Upper and Lower Basin were each allocated of water per year, a figure believed to represent half of the river&#x27;s annual flow at Lee&#x27;s Ferry. The allotments operated under the premise that approximately 17.5 million acre-feet of water flowed through the river annually.

Arizona initially refused to ratify the compact because it feared that California would take too much of the lower basin allotment. In 1944 a compromise was reached in which Arizona was allocated , but with the caveat that California&#x27;s allocation was prioritized during drought years. These and nine other decisions, compacts, federal acts and agreements made between 1922 and 1973 constitute what is now known as the Law of the River.

In 1944, a treaty between the U.S. and Mexico allocated of Colorado River water to Mexico each year. Morelos Dam was constructed in 1950 to enable Mexico to utilize its share of the river. Water allocated to Mexico from the Colorado River is regulated by the International Boundary and Water Commission, which also apportions waters from the Rio Grande between the two countries.

===Transmountain diversions===
Large-scale development of Colorado River water supplies started in the late 19th century, at the river&#x27;s headwaters in La Poudre Pass. The Grand Ditch, directing runoff from the river&#x27;s headwaters across the Continental Divide to arid eastern Colorado, was considered an engineering marvel when completed in 1890. This was the first of twenty-four &quot;transmountain diversions&quot; constructed to draw water across the Rocky Mountains as the Front Range corridor increased in population. These diversions draw water from the upper Colorado and its tributaries into the South Platte River, Arkansas River and Rio Grande basins. Today, about 80 percent of Colorado&#x27;s population lives on the eastern slope of the Rockies, while 80 percent of precipitation falls on the western slope.

While first planned at the same time as the Grand Ditch, construction on the Colorado–Big Thompson Project (C-BT) did not begin until the 1930s. Today, the C-BT is the largest of the transmountain diversions, delivering per year from the Colorado River to cities north of Denver. Numerous other projects followed, with the largest including the Roberts Tunnel, which delivers water from the Blue River to the city of Denver, and the Fryingpan–Arkansas Project, which diverts water from the Fryingpan River to the Arkansas River basin.

Combined, the transmountain diversions draw about of water per year out of the Colorado River basin. Historically, most of the water has been used for irrigation, although water usage is increasing for urban water supply and for recreational purposes such as snowmaking and increasing Eastern Slope streamflows for boating and fishing. Denver Water receives about 50 percent of its supply from the Colorado River basin. However, diversions have caused environmental harm to the upper Colorado River system by reducing streamflows in many tributaries. A number of reservoirs have been built to offset the impact of transmountain diversions by storing water for dry season release on the Western Slope, including Williams Fork Reservoir in 1959 and Wolford Mountain Reservoir in 1996.

===The Imperial Valley and the Salton Sea ===

The Colorado River delta region in Mexico became a favored place for Americans to invest in agriculture in the late 19th century when Mexican President Porfirio Díaz welcomed foreign capital to develop the country. The Colorado River Land Company, formed by Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler, his father-in-law Harrison Gray Otis, and others, developed the Mexicali Valley in Baja California as a thriving land company. The company headquarters was nominally based in Mexico, but its real headquarters was in Los Angeles, California. Land was leased mainly to Americans who were required to develop it. Colorado River water was used to irrigate the rich soil. The company largely escaped the turmoil of the Mexican Revolution (1910–20), but in the postrevolutionary period, the Mexican government expropriated the company&#x27;s land to satisfy the demand for land reform.

In 1900, the California Development Company (CDC) envisioned irrigating the Imperial Valley, a then dry basin on the California–Mexico border, using water from the Colorado River. Due to the valley&#x27;s location below sea level, water could be diverted and allowed to flow there entirely by gravity. Engineer George Chaffey was hired to design the Alamo Canal, which split from the Colorado near Pilot Knob, California and ran south into Mexico, where it joined the Alamo River, a dry arroyo which had historically carried overflowing floodwaters from the Colorado into the Salton Sink at the bottom of Imperial Valley. The scheme worked initially; by 1903, about four thousand people lived in the valley and more than of farmland had been developed.

The Alamo Canal experienced continual problems due to the Colorado&#x27;s high sediment content and its varying water levels. During low flows, the river often dropped below the level of the canal intake, while high flows silted up the intake, forcing the repeated excavation of new cuts. In early 1905, flooding destroyed the intake gates and water began to flow uncontrolled down the canal towards the Salton Sink. By August, the breach had grown large enough to swallow the entire flow of the river, which began to flood the bottom of the valley. The Southern Pacific Railroad attempted to dam the flow in order to protect their tracks which ran through the valley, but was hampered by repeated flooding. It took seven attempts, more than $3 million, and two years for the railroad, the CDC, and the federal government to permanently block the breach and restore the river&#x27;s original course – but not before part of the Imperial Valley was flooded under a lake, today&#x27;s Salton Sea. The Imperial Valley fiasco demonstrated that further economic development of the region would require a dam to control the Colorado&#x27;s unpredictable flows.

===Boulder Canyon Project===
A large dam on the Colorado River had been envisioned since the 1920s. In 1928, Congress authorized the Reclamation Service (today&#x27;s U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, or USBR) to build the Boulder Canyon Project, whose key feature would be a dam on the Colorado in Black Canyon southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. On September 30, 1935, Hoover Dam was completed, forming Lake Mead, capable of holding more than two years of the Colorado&#x27;s flow. Lake Mead was, and still is, the largest artificial lake in the U.S. by storage capacity. The construction of Hoover Dam stabilized the lower channel of the Colorado River, stored water for irrigation in times of drought, captured sediment and controlled floods. Hoover was the tallest dam in the world at the time of construction and also had the world&#x27;s largest hydroelectric power plant.

The Boulder Canyon Project Act also authorized the All-American Canal, which was built as a permanent replacement for the Alamo Canal and follows a route entirely within the U.S. on its way to the Imperial Valley. The canal&#x27;s intake is located at Imperial Dam, above Yuma, Arizona, which diverts the majority of the Colorado&#x27;s flow with only a small portion continuing to Mexico. With a capacity of over , the All-American Canal is the largest irrigation canal in the world. Because the hot, sunny climate lends to a year-round growing season, the Imperial Valley has become one of the most productive farming regions in North America, providing much of the winter produce supply in the U.S. The Imperial Irrigation District supplies water to south of the Salton Sea. The Coachella Canal, which branches northward from the All-American Canal, irrigates another in the Coachella Valley.

Parker Dam was initially built as the diversion point for the Colorado River Aqueduct, planned by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to supply water to Los Angeles. The construction of the dam was opposed by Arizona, which feared that California would take too much water from the Colorado; at one point, Arizona sent members of its National Guard to stop work on the dam. Ultimately, a compromise was reached, with Arizona dropping its objections in exchange for the USBR constructing the Gila Project, which irrigates on the Arizona side of the river. By 1941, the long Colorado River Aqueduct was completed, delivering of water west to Southern California. The aqueduct enabled the continued growth of Los Angeles and its suburbs, and provides water to about 10 million people today. The San Diego Aqueduct, which branches off from the Colorado River Aqueduct in Riverside County, California, opened in stages between 1954 and 1971 and provides water to another 3 million people in the San Diego metro area.

The Las Vegas Valley of Nevada experienced rapid growth after Hoover Dam, and by 1937 Las Vegas had tapped a pipeline into Lake Mead. Nevada officials, believing that groundwater resources in the southern part of the state were sufficient for future growth, were more concerned with securing a large amount of the dam&#x27;s power supply than water from the Colorado; thus they settled for the smallest water allocation of all the states in the Colorado River Compact. In 2018, due to declining water levels in Lake Mead, a second pipeline was completed with a lower intake elevation.

===Colorado River Storage Project===

In the first half of the 20th century, the Upper Basin states, with the exception of Colorado, had developed very little of their water allocations from the Colorado River Compact. By the 1950s, however, water demand was rapidly increasing in Utah&#x27;s Wasatch Front (Salt Lake City metro area) and the Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico, which both began exploring ways to divert water from the Colorado Basin. The Upper Basin states were concerned that they would not be able to use their full Compact allocations due to increasing water demands in the Lower Basin. The Compact requires the Upper Basin to deliver a minimum annual flow of past Lee&#x27;s Ferry (measured on a 10-year rolling average). Without additional reservoir storage, the Upper Basin states could not utilize their allocations without impacting water deliveries to the Lower Basin in dry years.
In 1956 Congress authorized the USBR to construct the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP), which planned several large reservoirs on the upper Colorado, Green, Gunnison and San Juan Rivers. The initial blueprints for the CRSP included two dams on the Green River within Echo Park Canyon in Dinosaur National Monument – a move criticized by both the National Park Service and environmental groups such as the Sierra Club. The controversy received nationwide media attention, and the USBR dropped its plans for the Dinosaur dams in exchange for increasing the size of a proposed dam at Glen Canyon.

The controversy associated with Glen Canyon Dam did not build momentum until construction was well underway. Due to Glen Canyon&#x27;s remote location, most of the American public did not even know of its existence; the few who did contended that it had much greater scenic value than Echo Park. The environmental movement in the American Southwest has opposed the damming and diversion of the Colorado River system due to negative effects on the ecology and natural beauty of the river and its tributaries. During the construction of Glen Canyon Dam (1956–66), environmental organizations vowed to block any further development of the river, and a number of later dam and aqueduct proposals were defeated by citizen opposition. Sierra Club leader David Brower fought the dam both during the construction and for many years afterwards until his death in 2000. Brower believed that he was personally responsible for the failure to prevent Glen Canyon&#x27;s flooding, calling it his &quot;greatest mistake, greatest sin&quot;.

In addition to Glen Canyon Dam, the CRSP includes the Flaming Gorge Dam on the Green River, the Blue Mesa, Morrow Point and Crystal Dams on the Gunnison River, and the Navajo Dam on the San Juan River. A total of 22 &quot;participating projects&quot; (of which 16 have been constructed) were later authorized in order to develop local water supplies at various locations across the Upper Basin states. These include the Central Utah Project, which delivers per year from the Green River basin to the Wasatch Front, and the San Juan–Chama Project, which diverts per year from the San Juan River to the Rio Grande Valley. Both are multi-purpose projects serving a variety of agricultural, municipal and industrial uses.

===Pacific Southwest Water Plan===

By the middle of the 20th century, planners were concerned that continued growth in water demand would outstrip the available water supply from the Colorado River. After exploring a multitude of potential projects, the USBR published a study in January 1964 known as the Pacific Southwest Water Plan, which proposed diverting water from the northwestern United States into the Colorado River basin. Arizona&#x27;s water allocation was a significant focus of the plan, due to the growing concern that its water supply could be curtailed due to California&#x27;s seniority of water rights. In addition, the plan would guarantee full water supplies to Nevada, California and Mexico, allowing the Upper Basin states to utilize their full allocations without risking reductions in the Lower Basin. The project would cost an estimated $3.1 billion.

The first stage of this plan would divert water from Northern California&#x27;s Trinity, Klamath and Eel Rivers to Southern California, allowing more Colorado River water to be used, by exchange, in Arizona. A canal system, which ultimately would become the Central Arizona Project (CAP), would be constructed to deliver Arizona&#x27;s Colorado River allocation to Phoenix and Tucson, both located far away from the Colorado River in the middle of the state. At this point, central Arizona was still entirely dependent on local water supplies, such as the 1911 Theodore Roosevelt Dam, and was quickly running out of surplus water.

In order to supply the massive amount of power required to pump Colorado River water to central Arizona, two hydroelectric dams were proposed in the Grand Canyon (Bridge Canyon Dam and Marble Canyon Dam), which while not directly located in Grand Canyon National Park, would greatly impact flows of the Colorado River through the park. With the controversy over Glen Canyon Dam still ongoing, the public pressure against these dams was immense. As a result, the two Grand Canyon dams were omitted from the final CAP authorization in 1968. In addition, the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park were redrawn to prevent future dam projects in the area. The pumping power was replaced by the building of the coal-fired Navajo Generating Station near Page, Arizona, in 1976. In 2019, the Navajo Generating Station ceased operation.

The CAP was constructed in stages from 1973 to 1993, ultimately extending from the Colorado River at Parker Dam to Tucson, Arizona. It delivers of water per year, irrigates of farmland and provides municipal water to about 5 million people. Due to environmental concerns, most of the facilities proposed in the Pacific Southwest Water Plan were never built (though a smaller version of the Trinity River project was constructed as part of the unrelated Central Valley Project), leaving Arizona and Nevada vulnerable to future water reductions under the Compact.

===Indigenous water rights===
Water rights of Native Americans in the Colorado River basin were largely ignored during the extensive water resources development carried out on the river and its tributaries in the 19th and 20th centuries. The construction of dams has often had negative impacts on tribal peoples, such as the Chemehuevi when their riverside lands were flooded after the completion of Parker Dam in 1938. Ten Native American tribes in the basin now hold or continue to claim water rights to the Colorado River. The U.S. government has taken some actions to help quantify and develop the water resources of Native American reservations. The first federally funded irrigation project in the U.S. was the construction of an irrigation canal on the Colorado River Indian Reservation in 1867. Other water projects include the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project, authorized in 1962 for the irrigation of lands in part of the Navajo Nation in north-central New Mexico. The Navajo continue to seek expansion of their water rights because of difficulties with the water supply on their reservation; about 40 percent of its inhabitants must haul water by truck many miles to their homes. In the 21st century, they have filed legal claims against the governments of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah for increased water rights. Some of these claims have been successful for the Navajo, such as a 2004 settlement in which they received a allotment from New Mexico.

===Post-2000 water supply ===
When the Colorado River Compact was drafted in the 1920s, it was based on barely 30 years of streamflow records that suggested an average annual flow of past Lee&#x27;s Ferry. Modern studies of tree rings revealed that those three decades were probably the wettest in the past 500 to 1,200 years and that the natural long-term annual flow past Lee&#x27;s Ferry is probably closer to , with a natural flow at the mouth around . This has resulted in more water being allocated to river users than actually exists in the Colorado. Droughts have exacerbated the issue of water over-allocation.
The most severe drought on record, the southwestern North American megadrought, began in the early 21st century, in which the river basin has produced above-average runoff in only five years between 2000 and 2021. The region is experiencing a warming trend, which is accompanied by earlier snowmelt, lower precipitation and greater evapotranspiration. A 2004 study showed that a 1–6 percent decrease of precipitation would lead to runoff declining by as much as 18 percent by 2050.

Since 2000, reservoir levels have fluctuated greatly from year to year, but have experienced a steady long-term decline. The particularly dry spell between 2000 and 2004 brought Lake Powell to just a third of capacity in 2005, the lowest level on record since initial filling in 1969. In late 2010, Lake Mead was approaching the &quot;drought trigger&quot; elevation of , at which water supplies to Arizona and Nevada would be reduced in accordance with the Colorado River Compact. Due to Arizona and Nevada&#x27;s water rights being junior to California&#x27;s, their allocations can legally be cut to zero before any reductions are made on the California side.

A wet winter in 2011 temporarily raised lake levels, but dry conditions returned in the next two years. In 2014, the Bureau of Reclamation cut releases from Lake Powell by 10 percent —the first such reduction since the 1960s, when Lake Powell was being filled for the first time. This resulted in Lake Mead dropping to its lowest recorded level since 1937, when it was first being filled.

Water year 2018 had a much lower-than-average snowpack. In July 2021, after two more extremely dry winters, Lake Powell fell below the previous low set in 2005. In response, the Bureau of Reclamation began releasing water from upstream reservoirs in order to keep Powell above the minimum level for hydropower generation. Lake Mead fell below the level expected to trigger federally mandated cuts to Arizona and Nevada&#x27;s water supplies for the first time in history, and is expected to continue declining into 2022.

On August 16, 2021, the Bureau of Reclamation released the Colorado River Basin August 2021 24-Month Study, and for the first time declared a shortage and that because of &quot;ongoing historic drought and low runoff conditions in the Colorado River Basin, downstream releases from Glen Canyon Dam and Hoover Dam will be reduced in 2022 due to declining reservoir levels.&quot;
The Lower Basin reductions will reduce the annual apportionments – Arizona&#x27;s by 18 percent, Nevada&#x27;s by 7 percent, and Mexico&#x27;s by 5 percent.

On June 14, 2022, Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton told the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural resources that additional cuts of 2–4 million acre-feet were required to stabilize reservoir levels in 2023. Touton warned that if states were unable to negotiate the requisite cuts the Interior department may use its legal authority to cut releases. When the states were unable to come to an agreement about how to share the proposed cuts, Reclamation began the legal steps to unilaterally reduce releases from Hoover and Glen Canyon Dams in 2023. As of December 2022 the lower basin states of Nevada, Arizona, and California had not agreed on how to reduce water use by the approximately 30% required to keep levels in lakes Mead and Powell from crashing. The Bureau of Reclamation has projected that water levels at Lake Powell could fall low enough that by July 2023 Glen Canyon Dam would no longer be able to generate any hydropower. Arizona proposed a plan that severely cut allocations to California, and California responded with a plan that severely cut allocations to Arizona, failing to reach consensus. In April 2023, the federal government proposed cutting allocations to Nevada, Arizona, and California evenly which would cut deliveries by as much as one-quarter to each state, rather than according to senior water rights.

In May 2023, the states finally reached a temporary agreement to prevent deadpool, reducing allocations by 3 million acre-feet over three years (until the end of 2026). 700,000 acre-feet were to be negotiated later among California, Arizona, and Nevada. The cuts were less than the federal government had demanded, and so further cuts will be needed after 2026. Fewer cuts were needed in the short term because the Colorado River Basin experienced an unusually rainy and snowy weather in early 2023.

The agreement also became easier to negotiate because many cuts are being offset by one-time federal funding. Billions of dollars in funding for programs in the Colorado River Basin to recycle water, increase efficiency, and competitive grants to pay water rights holders not to use water from the river are being provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act, and other programs funded through the United States Environmental Protection Agency and United States Department of the Interior. These are projected to reduce demand by hundreds of thousands of acre-feet per year.

==Ecology==
===Wildlife and plants===

The Colorado River and its tributaries often nourish extensive corridors of riparian growth as they traverse the arid desert regions of the watershed. Although riparian zones represent a relatively small proportion of the basin and have been affected by engineering projects and river diversion in many places, they have the greatest biodiversity of any habitat in the basin. The most prominent riparian zones along the river occur along the lower Colorado below Davis Dam, especially in the Colorado River Delta, where riparian areas support 358 species of birds despite the reduction in freshwater flow and invasive plants such as tamarisk (salt cedar). Reduction of the delta&#x27;s size has also threatened animals such as jaguars and the vaquita porpoise, which is endemic to the gulf. Human development of the Colorado River has also helped to create new riparian zones by smoothing the river&#x27;s seasonal flow, notably through the Grand Canyon.

More than 1,600 species of plants grow in the Colorado River watershed, ranging from the creosote bush, saguaro cactus, and Joshua trees of the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts to the forests of the Rocky Mountains and other uplands, composed mainly of ponderosa pine, subalpine fir, Douglas-fir and Engelmann spruce. Before logging in the 19th century, forests were abundant in high elevations as far south as the Mexico–U.S. border, and runoff from these areas nourished abundant grassland communities in river valleys. Some arid regions of the watershed, such as the upper Green River valley in Wyoming, Canyonlands National Park in Utah and the San Pedro River valley in Arizona and Sonora, supported extensive reaches of grassland roamed by large mammals such as buffalo and antelope as late as the 1860s. Near Tucson, Arizona, &quot;where now there is only powder-dry desert, the grass once reached as high as the head of a man on horse back&quot;.

Rivers and streams in the Colorado basin were once home to 49 species of native fish, of which 42 were endemic. Engineering projects and river regulation have led to the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species. Bonytail chub, razorback sucker, Colorado pikeminnow, and humpback chub are among those considered the most at risk; all are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river&#x27;s natural silty conditions and flow variations. Clear, cold water released by dams has significantly changed characteristics of habitat for these and other Colorado River basin fishes. A further 40 species that occur in the river today, notably the brown trout, were introduced during the 19th and 20th centuries, mainly for sport fishing.

===Impacts of development===
Historically, the Colorado transported from of sediment or silt to the Gulf of California each year – second only to the Mississippi among North American rivers. This sediment nourished wetlands and riparian areas along the river&#x27;s lower course, particularly in its delta, once the largest desert estuary on the continent. Currently, the majority of sediments carried by the Colorado River are deposited at the upper end of Lake Powell, and most of the remainder ends up in Lake Mead. Various estimates place the time it would take for Powell to completely fill with silt at 300 to 700 years. Dams trapping sediment not only pose damage to river habitat but also threaten future operations of the Colorado River reservoir system.

Reduction in flow caused by dams, diversions, water for thermoelectric power stations, and evaporation losses from reservoirs – the latter of which consumes more than 15 percent of the river&#x27;s natural runoff—has had severe ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California. Historically, the delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Gulf. Today&#x27;s desiccated delta, at only a fraction of its former size, no longer provides suitable habitat, and populations of fish, shrimp and sea mammals in the gulf have seen a dramatic decline. Since 1963, the only times when the Colorado River has reached the ocean have been during El Niño events in the 1980s and 1990s.

Reduced flows have led to increases in the concentration of certain substances in the lower river that have impacted water quality. Salinity is one of the major issues and also leads to the corrosion of pipelines in agricultural and urban areas. The lower Colorado&#x27;s salt content was about 50 parts per million (ppm) in its natural state, but by the 1960s, it had increased to well over 2000 ppm. By the early 1970s, there was also serious concern about salinity caused by salts leached from local soils by irrigation drainage water, which were estimated to add of excess salt to the river per year. The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act was passed in 1974, mandating conservation practices including the reduction of saline drainage. The program reduced the annual load by about , but salinity remains an ongoing issue. In 1997, the USBR estimated that saline irrigation water caused crop damages exceeding $500 million in the U.S. and $100 million in Mexico. Further efforts have been made to combat the salt issue in the lower Colorado, including the construction of a desalination plant at Yuma. In 2011, the seven U.S. states agreed upon a &quot;Plan of Implementation&quot;, which aims to reduce salinity by per year by 2030. In 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation estimated that around $32 million was spent each year to prevent around 1.2 million tons of salt from entering and damaging the Colorado River.

Agricultural runoff containing pesticide residues has also been concentrated in the lower river in greater amounts. This has led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone. The pesticide issue is even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by the Imperial Irrigation District with Colorado River water. In the Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the New and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea are among the most polluted bodies of water in the United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds. Pollution from agricultural runoff is not limited to the lower river; the issue is also significant in upstream reaches such as Colorado&#x27;s Grand Valley, also a major center of irrigated agriculture.

Large dams such as Hoover and Glen Canyon typically release water from lower levels of their reservoirs, resulting in stable and relatively cold year-round temperatures in long reaches of the river. The Colorado&#x27;s average temperature once ranged from at the height of summer to near freezing in winter, but modern flows through the Grand Canyon, for example, rarely deviate significantly from . Changes in temperature regime have caused declines of native fish populations, and stable flows have enabled increased vegetation growth, obstructing riverside habitat. These flow patterns have also made the Colorado more dangerous to recreational boaters; people are more likely to die of hypothermia in the colder water, and the general lack of flooding allows rockslides to build up, making the river more difficult to navigate.

====Minute 319====
In the 21st century, there has been renewed interest in restoring a limited water flow to the delta. In November 2012, the U.S. and Mexico reached an agreement, known as Minute 319, permitting Mexico storage of its water allotment in U.S. reservoirs during wet years, thus increasing the efficiency with which the water can be used. In addition to renovating irrigation canals in the Mexicali Valley to reduce leakage, this will make about per year available for release to the delta on average. The water will be used to provide both an annual base flow and a spring &quot;pulse flow&quot; to mimic the river&#x27;s original snowmelt-driven regime. The first pulse flow, an eight-week release of , was initiated on March 21, 2014, with the aim of revitalising of wetland. This pulse reached the sea on May 16, 2014, marking the first time in 16 years that any water from the Colorado flowed into the ocean, and was hailed as &quot;an experiment of historic political and ecological significance&quot; and a landmark in U.S.–Mexican cooperation in conservation. The pulse will be followed by the steady release of over the following three years, just a small fraction of its average flow before damming.

==Recreation==

Famed for its dramatic rapids and canyons, the Colorado is one of the most well-known whitewater rivers in the United States, and its Grand Canyon section—run by more than 22,000 people annually—has been called the &quot;granddaddy of rafting trips&quot;. Grand Canyon trips typically begin at Lee&#x27;s Ferry and take out at Diamond Creek or Lake Mead; they range from one to eighteen days for commercial trips and from two to twenty-five days for private trips. Private (noncommercial) trips are extremely difficult to arrange because the National Park Service limits river traffic for environmental purposes; people who desire such a trip often have to wait more than 10 years for the opportunity.

Several other sections of the river and its tributaries are popular whitewater runs, and many of these are also served by commercial outfitters. The Colorado&#x27;s Cataract Canyon and many reaches in the Colorado headwaters are even more heavily used than the Grand Canyon, and about 60,000 boaters run a single section above Radium, Colorado, each year. The upper Colorado also includes many of the river&#x27;s most challenging rapids, including those in Gore Canyon, which is considered so dangerous that &quot;boating is not recommended&quot;. Another section of the river above Moab, known as the Colorado &quot;Daily&quot; or &quot;Fisher Towers Section&quot;, is the most visited whitewater run in Utah, with more than 77,000 visitors in 2011 alone. The rapids of the Green River&#x27;s Gray and Desolation Canyons and the less difficult &quot;Goosenecks&quot; section of the lower San Juan River are also frequently traversed by boaters.

Eleven U.S. national parks—Arches, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, Petrified Forest, Rocky Mountain, Saguaro, and Zion—are in the watershed, in addition to many national forests, state parks, and recreation areas. Hiking, backpacking, camping, skiing, and fishing are among the multiple recreation opportunities offered by these areas. Fisheries have declined in many streams in the watershed, especially in the Rocky Mountains, because of polluted runoff from mining and agricultural activities. The Colorado&#x27;s major reservoirs are also heavily traveled summer destinations. Houseboating and water-skiing are popular activities on Lakes Mead, Powell, Havasu, and Mojave, as well as Flaming Gorge Reservoir in Utah and Wyoming, and Navajo Reservoir in New Mexico and Colorado. Lake Powell and surrounding Glen Canyon National Recreation Area received more than two million visitors per year in 2007, while nearly 7.9 million people visited Lake Mead and the Lake Mead National Recreation Area in 2008. Colorado River recreation employs some 250,000 people and contributes $26 billion each year to the Southwest economy.

<text>The Colorado River is an approximately river in the U.S. state of Texas. It is the 11th longest river in the United States and the longest river with both its source and its mouth within Texas.

Its drainage basin and some of its usually dry tributaries extend into New Mexico. It flows generally southeast from Dawson County through Ballinger, Marble Falls, Lago Vista, Austin, Bastrop, Smithville, La Grange, Columbus, Wharton, and Bay City, before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico at Matagorda Bay.

== Course ==

The Colorado River originates south of Lubbock, on the Llano Estacado near Lamesa. It flows generally southeast out of the Llano Estacado and through the Texas Hill Country, then through several reservoirs including Lake J.B. Thomas, E.V. Spence Reservoir, and O.H. Ivie Lake. The river flows through several more reservoirs before reaching Austin, including Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson (commonly referred to as Lake LBJ), and Lake Travis. The Llano River joins the Colorado at Lake LBJ near Kingsland, and the Pedernales River joins at Lake Travis near Briarcliff. After passing through Austin, the Colorado River continues flowing southeast until emptying into Matagorda Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, near Matagorda.

== History ==
The Colorado River, which means &#x27;red&#x27; or &#x27;reddish&#x27; river in Spanish, was frequently confused by Spanish explorers with the Brazos River to the north. The European discoverer of these two neighboring rivers called the present Colorado River the , and called the present Brazos the Colorado River. The two names would later be reversed.

The upper Colorado River was controlled by Comanches from the early 18th century to the late 19th century. In 1757, Spanish Texas attempted to establish an outlying Catholic mission (Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá) on the San Saba River, near its confluence with the Colorado River. Nearly defenseless and viewed by the Comanche tribe as a territorial invasion, the mission was sacked in 1758 by about 2,000 Comanches and their allies. The Comanche were not effectively challenged on the upper Colorado River for nearly a century.

== River modifications ==
The river is an important source of water for farming, cities, and electrical power production. Major man-made reservoirs on the river include Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake LBJ, Lake Marble Falls, Lake Travis, Lake Austin, Town Lake now called Lady Bird Lake in Austin. Collectively, these lakes are known as the Highland Lakes. In addition to power plants operating on each of the major lakes, waters of the Colorado are used for cooling the South Texas Nuclear Project near Bay City. The Colorado River Municipal Water District owns and operates three reservoirs upstream of the Highland Lakes: Lake J. B. Thomas near Snyder, E.V. Spence Reservoir near Robert Lee, and O.H. Ivie Lake near Ballinger.

Flood control and use of the Colorado River is managed by two agencies established by the Texas Legislature: the Upper Colorado River Authority and the Lower Colorado River Authority. There are 11 major reservoirs along the Colorado River.

==Major tributaries==

The Colorado River is joined by five significant tributaries: the Concho River, Pecan Bayou, the Llano River, the San Saba River and the Pedernales River. Beals Creek is also a tributary fed by arroyos such as the Sulphur Springs Draw, the Johnson Draw, and the McKenzie, Seminole, Monument, Mustang, and Midland draws.

<text>Fay Okell Bainter (December 7, 1893 – April 16, 1968) was an American film and stage actress. She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938) and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==

Bainter was born in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Charles F. Bainter and Mary Okell.

==Career==

Bainter made her first appearance on stage in 1908 in &quot;The County Chairman&quot; at Morosco&#x27;s Theater in Burbank, California. In 1910, she was a traveling stage actress. Her Broadway debut was in the role of Celine Marinter in &quot;The Rose of Panama&quot; (1912). P. G. Wodehouse, reviewing &quot;Turn to the Right&quot; in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 1916, wrote, &quot;Miss Bainter&#x27;s advent from nowhere and her instant success form the season&#x27;s biggest sensation.&quot; She appeared in a number of successful plays in New York, such as &quot;East Is West&quot;, &quot;The Willow Tree&quot;, and &quot;Dodsworth&quot;. In 1926, she appeared with Walter Abel in a Broadway production of Channing Pollock&#x27;s &quot;The Enemy&quot;. MGM persuaded her to try films and her movie debut was in &quot;This Side of Heaven&quot; (February 1934). Also in 1934, she appeared in &quot;Dodsworth&quot; on Broadway and in the film &quot;It Happened One Day&quot;. Bainter quickly achieved success in the movies, and in 1939, she became the first performer to receive two Oscar nominations in the same year, contending for both Best Actress for &quot;White Banners&quot; (1938) and Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938), winning for the latter. In 1940, she played Mrs. Gibbs in the film production of the Thornton Wilder play &quot;Our Town&quot;. In 1945, she played Melissa Frake in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;State Fair&quot;. She was again nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her role in &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; (1961).

Bainter has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.

==Personal life==
Fay Bainter and Reginald Venable were married on June 8, 1921, in Riverside, California. Cmdr. Reginald Venable was a United States Navy officer who graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1913. He resigned from the Navy in 1925 as a lieutenant commander to manage his wife&#x27;s business affairs. He had been a real-estate operator.

<text>White Banners is a 1938 Warner Bros. drama film directed by Edmund Goulding and starring Claude Rains, Fay Bainter, Jackie Cooper, Bonita Granville, Henry O&#x27;Neill, and Kay Johnson.

Produced by Henry Blanke and Hal B. Wallis, the screenplay was adapted by Lenore J. Coffee, Abem Finkel and Cameron Rogers from the 1936 novel of the same title by Lloyd C. Douglas.

==Plot==
On a dreary, cold, and snowy day in a small town in 1919 Indiana, peddler Hannah Parmalee (Bainter) appears at the door of a kind couple, Paul Ward (Rains) and his wife, Marcia (Johnson), selling apple peelers. Asked by Mrs. Ward to come inside and warm up, Hannah sees that they are struggling financially and are in need of some domestic help. She offers her services and becomes their cook and housekeeper for room and board.

Mr. Ward, a science teacher by day, is an inventor by night attempting to create something that will provide sufficient money for Marcia, their teenaged daughter Sally (Granville) and their new baby, to have some luxuries in life. Hannah, who is extremely wise and helpful, comes up with some good ideas. She persuades Ward to sell old and useless furniture to raise money and make a place for his work in the basement.

Their teenaged neighbor, Peter Trimble (Cooper), is one of Ward&#x27;s students and the son of the richest man in town, Sam Trimble (O&#x27;Neill). Hannah is very pleased to know Peter and to be a part of his life. In her devotion to him, however, she is never able to indulge the motherly instinct she feels, except in an indirect way. He is very good at science and, after Hannah suggests that he set a good example for the boy, Ward asks young Trimble to become his assistant. Sally develops a crush on Peter.

Ward&#x27;s invention, an &quot;iceless icebox,&quot; is unintentionally revealed by Peter to local mechanics Joe Ellis (William Pawley) and his brother Bill (Edward Pawley). When the Ellis brothers steal it and have it patented, Peter feels so bad about what he did that he lies when Ward asks him about it. In the meantime, Sally becomes ill with pneumonia.

Hannah persuades Ward that it is best to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; and to give young Peter another chance. Ward then develops a new and better feature for his invention, which is on its way to becoming an electric home refrigerator. Sally recovers and she and her mother, Marcia, leave on a trip with the baby.

Another crisis arises, however, when wealthy Chicago businessman Thomas Bradford (James Stephenson) arrives to discuss financing of Ward&#x27;s invention. Hannah reveals to Ward that Peter Trimble is her son who she was forced to give up all those years ago because he was born out of wedlock. Sam Trimble adopted him after his own baby died, but Bradford is the boy&#x27;s biological father. When Bradford finds out that Peter is his son, he wants to claim him. Hannah, however, persuades him not to reveal the truth to Peter.

Satisfied with the kind of young man her son has become, and that he is on the right path in life, Hannah, leaves without Peter, who believes that his adoptive parents are his biological parents. She walks off into the wintry landscape.

<doc id="180977" wikidata="Q238036" url="?curid=180977" title="Margaret Sullavan">
<text>Margaret Brooke Sullavan (May 16, 1909 – January 1, 1960) was an American stage and film actress. She began her career onstage in 1929 with the University Players on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In 1933, she caught the attention of film director John M. Stahl and made her screen debut that same year in &quot;Only Yesterday&quot;. She continued to be successful on stage and film, best known for &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot;.

Sullavan preferred working on the stage and made only 16 films, four of which were opposite close friend James Stewart in a popular partnership that included &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot; and &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot;. Stewart and Sullavan were also close friends of Henry Fonda, to whom Sullavan was married from 1931 to 1933. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;Three Comrades&quot; (1938). In the early 1940s, she retired from the screen to devote herself to her children and stage work. She returned to the screen in 1950 to make her last film, &quot;No Sad Songs for Me&quot;, in which she played a woman dying of cancer. For the rest of her career, she appeared only on the stage. Popular stage portrayals included Terry Randall in &quot;Stage Door&quot;, Sally Middleton in &quot;The Voice of the Turtle&quot; and Sabrina Fairchild in &quot;Sabrina Fair&quot;.

==Early life==
Sullavan was born May 16, 1909, in Norfolk, Virginia, the daughter of a wealthy stockbroker, Cornelius Sullavan, and his wife, Garland Councill Sullavan. She had a younger brother, Cornelius, and a half-sister, Louise &quot;Weedie&quot; Gregory. The first years of her childhood were spent isolated from other children. She suffered from a painful muscular weakness in the legs that prevented her from walking, so that she was unable to socialize with other children until the age of six. After her recovery she emerged as an adventurous and tomboyish child who preferred playing with children from a poorer neighborhood, much to the disapproval of her class-conscious parents. Her first dance performances were at Sunday school at St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal Church.

She attended boarding school at Chatham Episcopal Institute (now Chatham Hall), in Chatham, Virginia, where she was president of the student body and delivered the salutatory oration in 1927. Sullavan moved to Boston and lived with her half-sister, Weedie, while she studied dance at the Boston Denishawn studio and (against her parents&#x27; wishes) drama at the Copley Theatre. When her parents cut her allowance to a minimum, Sullavan defiantly paid her way by working as a clerk in the Harvard Cooperative Bookstore (The Coop), located in Harvard Square, Cambridge.

==Career==

===Early years===
Sullavan succeeded in getting a chorus part in the Harvard Dramatic Society 1929 spring production &quot;Close Up&quot;, a musical written by Harvard senior Bernard Hanighen, who was later a composer for Broadway and Hollywood.

The President of the Harvard Dramatic Society, Charles Leatherbee, along with the President of Princeton&#x27;s Theatre Intime, Bretaigne Windust, who together had established the University Players on Cape Cod the summer before, persuaded Sullavan to join them for their second summer season. Another member of the University Players was Henry Fonda, who had the comic lead in &quot;Close Up&quot;.

In the summer of 1929, Sullavan appeared opposite Fonda in &quot;The Devil in the Cheese&quot;, her debut on the professional stage. She returned for most of the University Players&#x27; 1930 season. In 1931, she squeezed in one production with the University Players between the closing of the Broadway production of &quot;A Modern Virgin&quot; in July and its tour in September. She rejoined the University Players for most of their 18-week 1930–31 winter season in Baltimore.

Sullavan&#x27;s parents did not approve of her choice of career. She played the lead in &quot;Strictly Dishonorable&quot; (1930) by Preston Sturges, which her parents attended. Confronted with her evident talent, they ceased their objections. &quot;To my deep relief,&quot; Sullavan later recalled, &quot;I thought I&#x27;d have to put up with their yappings on the subject forever.&quot;

A Shubert scout saw her in that play as well and eventually she met Lee Shubert himself. At the time, Sullavan was suffering from a bad case of laryngitis and her voice was huskier than usual. Shubert loved it. In subsequent years Sullavan would joke that she cultivated that &quot;laryngitis&quot; into a permanent hoarseness by standing in every available draft.

Sullavan made her debut on Broadway in &quot;A Modern Virgin&quot; (a comedy by Elmer Harris) on May 20, 1931, and began touring on August 3.

At one point in 1932, she starred in four Broadway flops in a row (&quot;If Love Were All&quot;, &quot;Happy Landing&quot;, &quot;Chrysalis&quot; (with Humphrey Bogart), and &quot;Bad Manners&quot;), but the critics praised Sullavan for her performances in all of them. In March 1933, Sullavan replaced another actor in &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; in New York. Movie director John M. Stahl happened to be watching the play and was intrigued by Sullavan. He decided she would be perfect for a picture he was planning, &quot;Only Yesterday&quot;.

At that time Sullavan had already turned down offers for five-year contracts from Paramount and Columbia. Universal Pictures offered Sullavan a three-year, two-pictures-per-year contract at $1,200 per week. She accepted it and had a clause put in her contract that allowed her to return to the stage on occasion. Later in her career, Sullavan signed only short-term contracts because she did not want to be &quot;owned&quot; by any studio.

===Hollywood===
Sullavan arrived in Hollywood on May 16, 1933, her 24th birthday. Her film debut came that same year in &quot;Only Yesterday&quot;. When she saw herself in the film&#x27;s early rushes, she was so appalled that she tried to purchase her contract for $2,500, but Universal refused. In his November 10, 1933, review in &quot;The New York Herald Tribune&quot;, Richard Watts, Jr. wrote that Sullavan &quot;plays the tragic and lovelorn heroine of this shrewdly sentimental orgy with such forthright sympathy, wise reticence and honest feeling that she establishes herself with some definiteness as one of the cinema people to be watched.&quot;

Sullavan&#x27;s next role came in &quot;Little Man, What Now?&quot; (1934), a film about a couple struggling to survive in impoverished post–World War I Germany. Universal was reluctant to produce a film about unemployment, starvation and homelessness, but &quot;Little Man&quot; was an important project to Sullavan. She would list the film appearance among the few Hollywood roles that afforded her a great measure of satisfaction.

In &quot;The Good Fairy&quot; (1935), Sullavan was able to illustrate her versatility. During the production, she married its director, William Wyler.

King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; (1935) dealt with people in the postbellum South and preceded the publication of Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s bestselling novel &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; by one year and the blockbuster film adaptation by four years. Sullavan played a childish Southern belle who matures into a responsible woman.

In &quot;Next Time We Love&quot; (1936), Sullavan played opposite the then-unknown James Stewart. She had been campaigning for Stewart to be her leading man, and the studio complied for fear that she would stage a threatened strike. The film dealt with a married couple who had grown apart over the years. This was the first of four films made by Sullavan and Stewart together. 

In the comedy &quot;The Moon&#x27;s Our Home&quot; (1936), Sullavan played opposite her ex-husband Henry Fonda as a newly married couple. Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell were recruited to improve the script&#x27;s dialogue, reportedly at Sullavan&#x27;s insistence. Her seventh film, &quot;Three Comrades&quot; (1938), is a drama set in post–World War I Germany. She gained an Oscar nomination for her role and was named the year&#x27;s best actress by the New York Film Critics Circle.

Sullavan reunited with Stewart in &quot;The Shopworn Angel&quot; (1938). Stewart played a sweet, naive Texan soldier on his way to fight in World War I who first marries Sullavan. Sullavan&#x27;s ninth film was &quot;The Shining Hour&quot; (1938), in which she played the suicidal sister-in-law of Joan Crawford&#x27;s character. Crawford insisted on the casting of Sullavan even though Louis B. Mayer warned Crawford that Sullavan could steal the picture from her. In &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; (1940), Sullavan and Stewart worked together again, playing colleagues who unknowingly exchange letters with each other.

In 1940, Sullavan also appeared in &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot;, a film about the lives of common Germans during the rise of Adolf Hitler; it was her last film with Stewart. &quot;Back Street&quot; (1941) was lauded as among the best performances of Sullavan&#x27;s Hollywood career, a film for which she ceded top billing to Charles Boyer to ensure that he would take the male lead part. &quot;So Ends Our Night&quot; (1941) was a wartime drama in which Sullavan, on loan to United Artists for a one-picture deal from Universal, played a Jewish exile fleeing the Nazis.

A 1940 court decision obligated Sullavan to fulfill her original 1933 agreement with Universal, requiring her to appear in two more films for the studio. These films would be &quot;Back Street&quot; (1941) and the light comedy &quot;Appointment for Love&quot; (1941).

&quot;Cry &#x27;Havoc&#x27;&quot; (1943) was Sullavan&#x27;s last film with M-G-M. After its completion, she was free of all film commitments. She had often referred to MGM and Universal as &quot;jails.&quot;

===Films with James Stewart===
Sullavan&#x27;s co-starring roles with James Stewart are among the highlights of their early careers. In 1935, Sullavan had decided on doing &quot;Next Time We Love&quot;. She had strong reservations about the story, but had to &quot;work-off the damned contract.&quot; The script contained a role that she thought might be ideal for Stewart, who was the best friend of Sullavan&#x27;s first husband, actor Henry Fonda. Years earlier, during a casual conversation with some fellow actors on Broadway, Sullavan predicted that Stewart would become a major Hollywood star.

By 1936, Stewart was a contract player at MGM but securing only small parts in B-movies. Sullavan, under contract with Universal, suggested that the studio test Stewart as her leading man. He was borrowed from MGM to star with Sullavan in &quot;Next Time We Love&quot;. The inexperienced Stewart had been nervous and unsure of himself during the early stages of production, and director Edward H. Griffith, began bullying him. However, Sullavan believed in Stewart and spent evenings coaching him and helping him scale down his awkward mannerisms and hesitant speech that were soon to be famous. &quot;It was Margaret Sullavan who made James Stewart a star,&quot; Griffith later said. Bill Grady of MGM said: &quot;That boy came back from Universal so changed I hardly recognized him.&quot; Gossip in Hollywood held that Sullavan&#x27;s husband William Wyler was suspicious about her rehearsing with Stewart privately. When Sullavan divorced Wyler in 1936 and married Leland Hayward that same year, they moved into a colonial house just a block away from that of Stewart. Stewart&#x27;s frequent visits to the Sullavan/Hayward home soon restoked the rumors of his romantic feelings for Sullavan.

Sullavan and Stewart&#x27;s second film together was &quot;The Shopworn Angel&quot; (1938). Walter Pidgeon, who also starred in the film, later recalled: &quot;I really felt like the odd-man-out in that one. It was really all Jimmy and Maggie ... It was so obvious he was in love with her. He came absolutely alive in his scenes with her, playing with a conviction and a sincerity I never knew him to summon away from her.&quot; Sullavan and Stewart appeared in four films together between 1936 and 1940 (&quot;Next Time We Love&quot;, &quot;The Shopworn Angel&quot;, &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot; and &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot;).

===Later years===
Sullavan took a break from films from 1943 to 1950. Throughout her career, Sullavan seemed to prefer the stage to the movies. She felt that only on the stage could she improve her skills as an actor. &quot;When I really learn to act, I may take what I have learned back to Hollywood and display it on the screen,&quot; she said in an interview in October 1936 (when she was doing &quot;Stage Door&quot; on Broadway between movies). &quot;But as long as the flesh-and-blood theatre will have me, it is to the flesh-and-blood theatre I&#x27;ll belong. I really am stage-struck. And if that be treason, Hollywood will have to make the most of it.&quot;

Another reason for her early retirement from the screen (1943) was that she wanted to spend more time with her children, Brooke, Bridget and Bill (then 6, 4 and 2 years old). She felt that she had been neglecting them and felt guilty about it. Sullavan still did stage work on occasion. From 1943 to 1944, she played the sexually inexperienced but curious Sally Middleton in &quot;The Voice of the Turtle&quot; (by John Van Druten) on Broadway and later in London (1947).

Sullavan returned to the screen in 1950 to do one last picture, &quot;No Sad Songs for Me&quot;. She played a suburban housewife and mother who learns that she will die of cancer within a year and who then determines to find a &quot;second&quot; wife for her soon-to-be-widower husband (Wendell Corey). Natalie Wood, then 11, played their daughter. After &quot;No Sad Songs for Me&quot; and its favorable reviews, Sullavan had a number of offers for other films, but she decided to concentrate on the stage for the rest of her career. Still, she did not return to the stage until 1952.

Her choice then was as the suicidal Hester Collyer, who meets fellow sufferer Mr. Miller (played by Herbert Berghof) in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;The Deep Blue Sea.&quot; In 1953, she agreed to appear in &quot;Sabrina Fair&quot; by Samuel Taylor.
On December 18, 1955, Sullavan appeared as the mystery guest on the TV panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

In 1955 and 1956, Sullavan appeared in &quot;Janus,&quot; a comedy by playwright Carolyn Green. Sullavan played the part of Jessica who writes under the pen name Janus, and Robert Preston played her husband. The play ran for 251 performances from November 1955 to June 1956.

In the late 1950s, Sullavan&#x27;s hearing and depression were getting worse. However, in 1959, she agreed to do &quot;Sweet Love Remembered&quot; by playwright Ruth Goetz. It was to be Sullavan&#x27;s first Broadway appearance in four years. Rehearsals began on December 1, 1959. She had mixed emotions about a return to acting, and her depression soon became clear to everyone: &quot;I loathe acting&quot;, she said on the day she started rehearsals. &quot;I loathe what it does to my life. It cancels you out. You cannot live while you are working. You are a person surrounded by an unbreachable wall&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sullavan had a reputation for being both temperamental and straightforward. On one occasion, Henry Fonda had decided to take up a collection for a 4th of July fireworks display. After Sullavan refused to make a contribution, Fonda complained loudly to a fellow actor. Sullavan rose from her seat and doused Fonda from head to foot with a pitcher of ice water. Fonda made a stately exit, and Sullavan, composed and unconcerned, returned to her table and ate heartily.

Sullavan refused to allow the firing of a writer on &quot;No Sad Songs for Me&quot; for his left-wing views. M-G-M studio chief Louis B. Mayer always seemed wary and nervous in her presence. &quot;She was the only player who outbullied Mayer,&quot; Eddie Mannix of MGM later said of Sullavan. &quot;She gave him the willies.&quot;. Some have attributed the death of Sam Wood, a keen anti-Communist, to a dispute he had with Sullavan. Wood died from a heart attack shortly after a raging argument with Sullavan. 

===Marriages and family===

Sullavan was married four times. At age 22, she married actor Henry Fonda on December 25, 1931, while both were performing with the University Players in their 18-week winter season at the Congress Hotel ballroom in Baltimore, Maryland. &quot;She was a character even the first time I met her,&quot; Fonda recalled. Sullavan and Fonda separated after two months and divorced in 1933, but remained longtime friends, and their children also became friends. Jane Fonda remembers a &quot;vivid image&quot; of Margaret Sullavan. &quot;What impressed me the most was how athletic and tomboyish she was. Dad had taught her how to walk on her hands during their courtship, and she could still suddenly turn herself upside down—and there she&#x27;d be, walking along on her hands.&quot; Peter Fonda named his daughter in honor of Bridget Hayward, Sullavan&#x27;s second child, who died by suicide in 1960. He had admitted he was in love with Hayward, but they never had a relationship.

After separating from Fonda, Sullavan began a relationship with Broadway producer Jed Harris that was tumultuous and short-lived. Then, during the shooting of &quot;The Good Fairy,&quot; she began a relationship with its director, William Wyler. He said, &quot;One day I looked at the rushes and she didn&#x27;t look good.&quot; The cameraman informed him that Sullavan had had a fight with him that day of shooting, and that &quot;When she&#x27;s happy she looks pretty, when she&#x27;s upset she doesn&#x27;t!&quot; So, Wyler asked her on a date and their relationship blossomed. They married in November 1934 and divorced in March 1936. Wyler remembered it as &quot;A miserable wedding. Jeez. Awful. My lawyer had arranged it. I chartered this airplane, and flew to Arizona. We went to this justice of the peace; he stood there in a robe and slippers and said, &#x27;All right, here, get together&#x27;—the radio was going all this time—and he married us.&quot;
Sullavan&#x27;s third marriage was to agent and producer Leland Hayward, Sullavan&#x27;s agent since 1931. At the time of the marriage on November 15, 1936, Sullavan was pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first child. Their daughter, Brooke Hayward, later became an actress and a writer. The couple had two more children, Bridget Hayward and William Hayward III (&quot;Bill&quot;), who became a film producer and attorney. In 1947, Sullavan filed for divorce after discovering that Hayward was having an affair with socialite Slim Keith. Their divorce became final on April 20, 1948.

In 1950, Sullavan married for a fourth and final time, to English investment banker Kenneth Wagg. They remained married until her death in 1960.

===Mental breakdown===
In 1955, when Sullavan&#x27;s two younger children told their mother that they preferred to stay with their father permanently, she suffered a nervous breakdown. Sullavan&#x27;s eldest daughter, Brooke, later wrote about the breakdown in her 1977 autobiography &quot;Haywire&quot;; Sullavan begged her son to stay with her. He remained adamant in his refusal, and his mother had started to cry. &quot;This time she couldn&#x27;t stop. Even from my room the sound was so painful I went into my bathroom and put my hands on my ears.&quot; In another scene from the book, a friend of the family (Millicent Osborne) had been alarmed by the sound of whimpering from the bedroom: &quot;She walked in and found Mother under the bed, huddled in a fetal position. Kenneth was trying to get her out. The more authoritative his tone of voice, the farther under she crawled. Millicent Osborne took him aside and urged him to speak gently, to let her stay there until she came out of her own accord.&quot; Eventually Sullavan agreed to spend some time (two and a half months) in a private mental institution. Her two younger children, Bridget and Bill, also spent time in various institutions. Bridget died of a drug overdose in October 1960, while Bill died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in March 2008.

===Hearing loss===
Sullavan suffered from the congenital hearing defect otosclerosis that worsened as she aged, making her more and more hearing-impaired. Her voice had developed a throatiness because she could hear low tones better than high ones. From early 1957, Sullavan&#x27;s hearing declined so much that she was becoming depressed and sleepless and often wandered about all night. She often stayed in bed for days, her only words: &quot;Just let me be, please.&quot;

She had kept her hearing problem largely hidden. On January 8, 1960 (one week after Sullavan&#x27;s death), &quot;New York Post&quot; reporter Nancy Seely wrote: &quot;The thunderous applause of a delighted audience—was it only a dim murmur over the years to Margaret Sullavan? Did the poised and confident mien of the beautiful actress mask a sick fear, night after night, that she&#x27;d miss an important cue?&quot;

Sullavan had an operation done by Dr. Julian Lempert in the late 40s, which Brooke described as a “success, and restored full hearing to Mother’s left ear,” but she didn&#x27;t follow his advice for cutting down on “diving, shooting or flying.”

Sullavan bequeathed her ears to the Lempert Institute of Otymology. Lempert believed that &quot;there was so much misunderstanding of some of the things she did, the nervousness, the worry—which were simply a result of her deafness ... She suffered as do most who are hard of hearing who try to keep it a secret and make themselves nervous wrecks.&quot;

==Death==
On January 1, 1960, at about 5:30 p.m., Sullavan was found in bed, barely alive and unconscious, in a hotel room in New Haven, Connecticut. Her copy of the script to &quot;Sweet Love Remembered&quot;, in which she was then starring during its tryout in New Haven, was found open beside her, as well as a bottle of prescribed pills. Sullavan was rushed to Grace New Haven Hospital, but shortly after 6:00 p.m. she was pronounced dead on arrival. She was 50 years old.

No note was found to indicate suicide, and initially no conclusion was reached as to whether her death was the result of a deliberate or an accidental overdose of barbiturates. Ultimately, the county coroner officially ruled Sullavan&#x27;s death an accidental overdose. After a private memorial service in Greenwich, Connecticut, with such attendees as former friend and co-star Joan Crawford, theatre producer Martin Gabel, and actress Sandra Church, Sullavan was interred at Saint Mary&#x27;s Whitechapel Episcopal Churchyard in Lancaster, Virginia.

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Margaret Sullavan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1751 Vine Street. She was inducted, posthumously, into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1981.

Sullavan was the favorite actress of silent-film beauty Louise Brooks, who said Sullavan was &quot;the person I would be if I could be anyone&quot; and described her as “Strange, fey, mysterious—like a voice singing in the snow.” Brooks thought Sullavan&#x27;s life could only be understood by her love of Leland Hayward, even after their divorce. Brooks wrote this: &quot;After he left her to marry Nancy (Slim) Hawks in 1947, this terrifyingly self-willed woman shredded her career through the following twelve years with her struggle to repossess him. When Nancy divorced him there was a flaming period of hope in 1959. Then came the news of LeLand&#x27;s decision to marry Pamela Churchill—and she sank in to despair and death.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Sullavan&#x27;s eldest daughter, actress Brooke Hayward, wrote &quot;Haywire&quot;, a best-selling memoir about her family, that was adapted into the miniseries &quot;Haywire&quot; starring Lee Remick as Margaret Sullavan and Jason Robards as Leland Hayward.

<doc id="180978" wikidata="Q1040470" url="?curid=180978" title="Three Comrades (1938 film)">
<text>Three Comrades is a 1938 American drama film directed by Frank Borzage and produced by Joseph L. Mankiewicz for MGM. The screenplay is by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Edward E. Paramore Jr., and was adapted from the novel &quot;Three Comrades&quot; by Erich Maria Remarque.

&quot;Three Comrades&quot; is story of comradery between young German soldiers after World War I, during the Weimar Republic and rise of Nazism.

The film stars Robert Taylor, Margaret Sullavan, Franchot Tone and Robert Young. Sullavan was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Plot==

On the last day of World War I, November 11, 1918, three German fighter pilots - Erich Lohkamp, Otto Koster, and Gottfried Lenz - are having a final drink with their compatriots. They toast each other, expressing fatalistic attitudes about the future. With their only hope being in their friendship, the three comrades open a taxi and auto repair business and are barely able to eke out a living.

One day several years later (1920), while driving to a country inn in Otto&#x27;s precious souped-up jalopy roadster, &quot;Baby&quot;, to celebrate Erich&#x27;s birthday (the youngest and least cynical of the three), the friends get into a back road car race with a Herr Breuer, who is driving a luxury car, accompanied by Patricia Hollmann. The boys win their little race and they - along with Breuer and Pat - all arrive at the country inn together. While drinking together, the friends learn that Pat is a young German aristocrat who is now impoverished, while Breuer is a rich fascist sympathizer seeking a sugar daddy relationship with Pat. Though Pat is worldly, she is drawn to the innocent Erich, and gives him her telephone number. Otto and Gottfried encourage the relationship, feeling that their love will be the group&#x27;s only salvation, but Erich feels that Pat&#x27;s background will keep them apart, so he tells his friends he has thrown away Pat&#x27;s number. Nevertheless, Erich - with strong encouragement from Gottfried - eventually calls Pat (he had not thrown away her number after all), and the two agree to a date.

Pat and Erich start seeing each other and, one night, Pat invites Erich to the opera, where they run into Breuer. Breuer invites them to join him at a fancy nightclub, where Erich&#x27;s borrowed formal white tie &amp; tails starts to disintegrate, to the taunting laughter of Breuer and his drunken, rich friends. Erich leaves in embarrassment, thinking his poor status shames him in Pat&#x27;s eyes. But later that night, he finds Pat waiting for him outside his apartment, where she convinces him that her feelings for him are stronger than any difference in their social or economic situation - and the two realize that they are truly and equally in love.

Some time later, both Gottfried and Otto separately do their best to persuade Pat and Erich to follow their hearts despite the poverty: Gottfried tries to convince Erich to marry Pat, while Otto tries to convince Pat to marry Erich. When Pat resists Otto&#x27;s entreaties and he presses her for an answer, she reveals that she had been very ill and will be ill again because of her lungs (with tuberculosis). Otto convinces her that she should marry Erich regardless, no matter how brief their happiness might be, and she finally agrees.

On their honeymoon, Pat collapses as she and Erich (who does not know of her illness) are playing on the beach. When the local doctor reveals her condition to Erich, and says that she may die if her hemorrhaging does not stop very soon, Erich calls Otto to find Pat&#x27;s specialist, Dr. Felix Jaffe. Driving wildly through fog in his beloved &quot;Baby&quot;, Otto returns with Dr. Jaffe just in time to save Pat, but the doctor warns that she must go to a sanitarium no later than the middle of October.

Through the summer, Otto, Erich, Gottfried and Pat are happy together, even though they worry about her health. The idealistic Gottfried is torn between his devotion to his friends and his belief in the teachings of political pacifist, Dr. Heinrich Becker. On the day that Pat must leave for the sanitarium, Erich and Otto witness a fascist thug shooting Gottfried to death while trying to kill Dr. Becker. Now faced with the loss of Gottfried as well Pat&#x27;s absence, Erich and Otto sell their shop and drift through the next months, roaming the streets in &quot;Baby&quot;, seeking Gottfried&#x27;s killer. At Christmas, Otto finally finds the murderer, trailing him to a church where Handel&#x27;s Messiah Hallelujah Chorus is being sung, and kills him in a shootout as the chorus reaches its climax.

That same night, Erich receives a telegram from Pat that she must have an operation to collapse her lung. Her doctor at the sanitarium warns her that, after the operation, Pat must stay bedridden and very very still for two weeks or endanger her life. When Otto and Erich visit her, Erich learns about her need for extreme stillness after the operation and that the operation will cost over 1,000 marks.

Erich tells the doctor to proceed with the operation and Otto decides to sell &quot;Baby&quot; to pay for it. When Otto goes to see her after the operation, he admits that Gottfried is dead and that he has sold &quot;Baby&quot;, and she tells him that their self-sacrifices for her must stop, as her need for future care will be endless - and expensive - and will ruin Erich&#x27;s and Otto&#x27;s lives. Otto encourages her to live for Erich and, as they finish speaking, Erich arrives and Otto leaves. Pat speaks to Erich of the three of them escaping to Rio right away. Erich tells her to simply focus on getting better and steps outside to say goodbye to Otto. When alone, Pat slowly walks out to the room&#x27;s balcony - a simple movement that she knows will likely cause her death. She is seen from below by Erich as she collapses. He rushes to her side just in time to hear her say: &quot;It&#x27;s right for me to die, darling. It isn&#x27;t hard...and I&#x27;m so full of love.&quot; For the three comrades and Patricia, death is not a repudiation of the love they shared.

After Pat&#x27;s funeral, as they hear fighting in their city between fascist thugs and pro-democracy protesters, Otto and Erich decide to move to South America. As they leave the cemetery, you can see the spirits of Gottfried and Pat walking beside them.

==Reception==
Frank Nugent, critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called &quot;Three Comrades&quot; &quot;a beautiful and memorable film. Faithful to the spirit and, largely, to the letter of the novel, it has been magnificently directed, eloquently written, and admirably played.&quot; He praised nearly all of the main actors, particularly Sullavan (&quot;hers is a shimmering, almost unendurably lovely performance&quot;) and was less impressed with Taylor (&quot;who is good occasionally but more often is merely acceptable&quot;).

According to MGM records, the film earned $1,193,000 in the United States and Canada and $850,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $472,000.

The film was nominated for the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2002 list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions.

<text>The Special Atomic Demolition Munition (SADM), also known as the XM129 and XM159 Atomic Demolition Charges, and the B54 bomb was a nuclear man-portable atomic demolition munition (ADM) system fielded by the US military from the 1960s to 1980s but never used in combat. It had an estimated yield of up to 1,000 tons of TNT.

==History and design==
At the time of the weapon&#x27;s development, the existing Atomic Demolition Munition (ADM) was the T-4 Atomic Demolition Munition. Its transport required 4 men, each carrying a section of the weapon.

Development began in June 1960 and an interim Mark 54 Mod 0 (now called the B54-0) weapon was put into production in April 1963. Production of the B54 Mod 1 SADM began in August 1964. The weapon was in diameter, long, and weighed . It included the warhead, a fuzing and firing system with a mechanical timer, a ferroelectric firing set, and a sealed housing. The body was constructed with aluminum forgings and molded fiberglass, and foam-rubber insulation was used between the warhead and case. Dials were illuminated with tritium-phosphor paint for easy night-reading. A housing for underwater emplacement was provided that included external controls.

The B54 Mod 2 started production in June 1965. The weapon was the same size as previous mods but now weighed more – .

The yield was estimated to be .

==Use==
===Offensive use===
ADM employment manuals describe the use of ADMs tactically in both offensive and defensive operations.

In offensive operations, ADMs are described as being useful for improving flank and rear security of a unit, impeding counterattacks and assisting in enemy entrapment.

===Engineering and defensive use===
ADM employment manuals describe the use of ADMs defensively for combat engineering purposes. Possible targets described include bridges, dams, canals, tunnels, airfields, railroad marshaling yards, ports and industrial plants, and power facilities.

Extensive tables were provided to enable the selection of the correct yield for each particular target. These tables accounted for various employment particulars such as depth of burial, fallout considerations, and minimum safe separation distances between adjacent weapons and personnel.

==Suicide attack allegations==
On December 27, 2018, the &quot;Green Bay Press-Gazette&quot; interviewed veteran Mark Bentley, who had trained for the Special Atomic Demolition Munition program to manually place and detonate the SADM. The report stated that he and other soldiers training for the program knew this was a suicide mission because either it would be unrealistic to outrun the timer on the bomb, or soldiers would be obligated to secure the site before the timer went off.

However, employment manuals specifically describe the firing party and their guard retreating from the emplacement site, at which point security of the device is provided through a combination of passive security measures, including concealment, camouflage, and the use of decoys, as well as active security measures including booby traps, obstacles (such as concertina wire and landmines), and long-range artillery fire. Further, the SADM included a Field Wire Remote Control System (FWRCS), a device that enabled the sending of safe/arm and firing signals to the weapon via a wire for safe remote detonation of the weapon.

<text>Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland (October 22, 1917 – December 15, 2013), known professionally as Joan Fontaine, was an English-American actress best known for her roles in Hollywood films during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Fontaine appeared in more than 45 films in a career that spanned five decades. She was the younger sister of actress Olivia de Havilland. Their rivalry was well-documented in the media at the height of Fontaine&#x27;s career.

She began her film career in 1935, signing a contract with RKO Pictures. Fontaine received her first major roles in &quot;The Man Who Found Himself&quot; (1937) and in &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939). Her career prospects improved greatly after her starring role in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940), for which she received her first of three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress. The following year, she won that award for her role in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Suspicion&quot; (1941). A third nomination came with &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot; (1943). She appeared mostly in drama films through the 1940s, including &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; and the comedy &quot;You Gotta Stay Happy&quot; (both 1948), which she co-produced with her second husband William Dozier through their film production company Rampart Productions. In the next decade, after her role in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1952), her film career began to decline and she moved into stage, radio and television roles. She appeared in fewer films in the 1960s, which included &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (1961), and her final film role in &quot;The Witches&quot; (1966), also known as &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot;.

She released an autobiography, &quot;No Bed of Roses&quot;, in 1978, and continued to act until 1994. Her Academy Award for &quot;Suspicion&quot; makes Fontaine the only actress to have won an Oscar for acting in a Hitchcock film. She and her sister Olivia remain the only siblings to have won lead-acting Academy Awards.

== Early life ==
Joan de Beauvoir deHavilland was born on October 22, 1917, in Tokyo City, in the then Empire of Japan, to English parents. Her father, Walter de Havilland (1872–1968), was educated at the University of Cambridge and served as an English professor at the Imperial University in Tokyo before becoming a patent attorney. Her mother, Lilian Augusta Ruse de Havilland Fontaine (1886–1975), was educated at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and became a stage actress who left her career after going to Tokyo with her husband. Her mother returned to work with the stage name &quot;Lilian Fontaine&quot; after Joan and her elder sister Olivia de Havilland achieved prominence in the 1940s. Joan&#x27;s paternal cousin was Sir Geoffrey de Havilland (1882–1965), an aircraft designer known for the de Havilland Mosquito, and founder of the aircraft company which bore his name. Her paternal grandfather, the Reverend Charles Richard deHavilland, was from a family from Guernsey, in the Channel Islands.

De Havilland&#x27;s parents married in 1914 and separated in 1919 when she was two; the divorce was not finalized, however, until February 1925.

Taking a physician&#x27;s advice, Lilian deHavilland moved Joanreportedly a sickly child who had developed anaemia following a combined attack of the measles and a streptococcal infectionand her sister to the United States. The family settled in Saratoga, California, and Fontaine&#x27;s health improved dramatically during her teen years. She was educated at nearby Los Gatos High School and was soon taking diction lessons alongside Olivia. When she was 16 years old, Joan returned to Japan to live with her father. There she attended the Tokyo School for Foreign Children, graduating in 1935.

== Career ==
Fontaine made her stage debut in the West Coast production of &quot;Call It a Day&quot; (1935) and made her film debut in MGM&#x27;s &quot;No More Ladies&quot; (1935), in which she was credited as Joan Burfield. She was leading lady to Bruce Bennett (billed as Herman Brix) in a low-budget independent film, &quot;A Million to One&quot; (1937).

===RKO===
Fontaine signed a contract with RKO Pictures. Her first film for the studio was &quot;Quality Street&quot; (1937) starring Katharine Hepburn, in which Fontaine had a small unbilled role.

The studio considered her a rising star, and touted &quot;The Man Who Found Himself&quot; (1937) with John Beal as her first starring role, placing a special screen introduction, billed as the &quot;new RKO screen personality&quot; after the end credit. Fontaine later said it had &quot;an A budget but a Z story&quot;.

RKO put her in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Beat Love&quot; (1937) with Preston Foster and &quot;Music for Madame&quot; (1937) with Nino Martini.

She next appeared in a major role alongside Fred Astaire in his first RKO film without Ginger Rogers, &quot;A Damsel in Distress&quot; (1937). Despite its being directed by George Stevens, audiences were disappointed and the film flopped. She was top-billed in the comedies &quot;Maid&#x27;s Night Out&quot; and &quot;Blond Cheat&quot;, then was Richard Dix&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;Sky Giant&quot; (all 1938).

Edward Small borrowed her to play Louis Hayward&#x27;s love interest in &quot;The Duke of West Point&quot; (1938), then Stevens used her at RKO in &quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939) as Douglas Fairbanks Jr.&#x27;s love interest. The film was a huge hit, but Fontaine&#x27;s part was relatively small. Republic borrowed her to support Dix in &quot;Man of Conquest&quot; (1939) but her part was small. George Cukor gave her a small role in MGM&#x27;s &quot;The Women&quot; (1939).

===David O. Selznick and Hitchcock===
Fontaine&#x27;s luck changed one night at a dinner party when she found herself seated next to producer David O. Selznick. Selznick and she began discussing the Daphne du Maurier novel &quot;Rebecca&quot;, and Selznick asked her to audition for the part of the unnamed heroine. She endured a grueling six-month series of film tests along with hundreds of other actresses before securing the part sometime before her 22nd birthday.

&quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940), starring [Laurence Olivier] alongside Fontaine, marked the American debut of British director Alfred Hitchcock. The film was released to glowing reviews, and Fontaine was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Fontaine did not win that year (Ginger Rogers took home the award for &quot;Kitty Foyle&quot;), but she did win the following year for Best Actress in &quot;Suspicion&quot;, which co-starred Cary Grant and was also directed by Hitchcock. This was the only Academy Award-winning acting performance to have been directed by Hitchcock.

Fontaine was then one of the biggest female stars in Hollywood, although she was typecast in female melodrama. &quot;They seemed to want to make me cry the whole Atlantic&quot;, she later said. However, historically, she had become the top female star of the 1940s.

20th Century Fox borrowed her to appear opposite Tyrone Power in &quot;This Above All&quot; (1942) then she went to Warner Brothers to star alongside Charles Boyer in &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot;. She was nominated for a third Academy Award for her performance in this film.

She also starred as the titular protagonist in the film &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; that year, which was developed by Selznick then sold to Fox.

During the war Fontaine occasionally worked as a nurse&#x27;s aide.

She starred in the film &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1944). Like &quot;Rebecca&quot;, this was based on a novel by Daphne du Maurier. Fontaine personally considered &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot; one of her least favorites among the films she starred in.

Selznick wanted to cast her in &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot; (1944) but she refused, saying she was &quot;sick of playing the sad sack&quot;. Selznick suspended her for eight months. Eventually she went back to work in &quot;The Affairs of Susan&quot; (1945) for Hal Wallis at Paramount, her first comedy. She returned to RKO for &quot;From This Day Forward&quot; (1946).

===Rampart Productions===
In August 1946 Fontaine set up her own company, Rampart Productions, with her then-husband William Dozier. Her contract with Selznick ended in February 1947 and Fontaine would work exclusively for Rampart apart from one film a year for RKO.

Their first film was &quot;Ivy&quot; (1947), a thriller where she played an unsympathetic part.

Fontaine also appeared in &quot;Letter from an Unknown Woman&quot; (1948) directed by Max Ophüls, produced by John Houseman and co-starring Louis Jourdan. It was made by Rampart Productions and released through Universal. It is today considered to be a classic with one of the finest performances of her career.

At Paramount, she appeared opposite Bing Crosby in Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Emperor Waltz&quot; (1948) then went to Universal for another film for Rampart, &quot;You Gotta Stay Happy&quot; (1948), a comedy with James Stewart.

Fontaine starred in &quot;Kiss the Blood Off My Hands&quot; (1948), with Burt Lancaster, Nathan Juran and Bernard Herzbrun. Art directors, and set decorators created thirty blocks of huge sets to represent the waterfront district of London&#x27;s East End in this successful film noir. At Paramount she did &quot;September Affair&quot; (1950) with Joseph Cotten for Wallis, &quot;Darling, How Could You!&quot; (1951) and &quot;Something to Live For&quot; (1952), a third film with George Stevens. At RKO she was a femme fatale in &quot;Born to Be Bad&quot; (1950).

MGM hired Fontaine to play the love interest in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1952), a big success. She was reunited with Jourdan in &quot;Decameron Nights&quot; (1953) then went to Paramount for the low-budget &quot;Flight to Tangier&quot; (1953) with Jack Palance.

===Film, TV, and theatre===
Fontaine made &quot;The Bigamist&quot; (1953), directed by Ida Lupino. She began appearing in TV shows such as &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Ford Theatre&quot;, &quot;Star Stage&quot;, &quot;The 20th Century Fox Hour&quot;, &quot;The Joseph Cotten Show&quot;, and &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;.

She won good reviews for her role on Broadway in 1954 as Laura in &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;, playing the role originated by Deborah Kerr. She appeared opposite Anthony Perkins and toured the show for a few months.

She was Bob Hope&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Big Night&quot;, then supported Mario Lanza in &quot;Serenade&quot; (both 1956). She was in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Beyond a Reasonable Doubt&quot; (1956) at RKO.

Fontaine had a big hit with &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; (1957) having a romance with Harry Belafonte. At MGM she appeared with Jean Simmons and Paul Newman in &quot;Until They Sail&quot; (1957) then she made &quot;A Certain Smile&quot; (1958) at Fox.

===1960s===
Fontaine had the female lead in the popular &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (1961) at Fox. She had a key role in &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot; (1962) also at Fox.

Most of her 1960s work was done on television or stage. TV shows included &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Startime&quot;, &quot;Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond&quot;, &quot;Checkmate&quot;, &quot;The Dick Powell Show&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, and &quot;The Bing Crosby Show&quot;.

In October 1964 she returned to Broadway to appear in &quot;A Severed Head&quot;.

She tried a Hammer horror film, &quot;The Witches&quot; (1966) which she also co-produced.

Her stage work included &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; and an Austrian production of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;.

In 1967, she appeared in &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; in Chicago. The following year she appeared in &quot;Private Lives&quot;.

She played &quot;Forty Carats&quot; on Broadway.

===Later career===
In the 1970s Fontaine appeared in stage shows and toured with a poetry reading.

She returned to Hollywood for the first time in 15 years in 1975 to appear in an episode of &quot;Cannon&quot; especially written for her. She was in &quot;The Users&quot; (1978) and was nominated for an Emmy Award for the soap opera &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; in 1980.

Fontaine published her autobiography, &quot;No Bed of Roses&quot;, in 1978. In 1982, she traveled to Berlin, Germany, and served as a jury president for the Berlin International Film Festival.

In the early 1980s, after 25 years in New York, she moved to Carmel, California. &quot;I have no family ties anymore, so I want to work&quot;, she said. &quot;I still host an interview show for cable in New York. I lecture all over the country. But it wasn&#x27;t enough. My theory is that if you stay busy, you haven&#x27;t time to grow old. Or at least you don&#x27;t notice it.&quot;

She starred in &quot;Aloha Paradise&quot;, &quot;Bare Essence&quot;, and &quot;Crossings&quot; (1986). She played the lead in a TV movie, &quot;Dark Crossings&quot; (1986), replacing Loretta Young. She said, &quot;At my time in life, I don&#x27;t want to do bit parts. Also, Rosalind Russell once said, &#x27;Always escape the mother parts.&#x27; And I&#x27;ve avoided them.&quot;

Fontaine&#x27;s last role for television was in the 1994 TV film &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;, after which she retired to her estate, Villa Fontana, in Carmel Highlands, California, where she spent time in her gardens and with her dogs.

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Fontaine has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1645 Vine Street. She left her hand and foot prints in front of the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on May 26, 1942.

She was a practicing Episcopalian and a member of Episcopal Actors Guild.

== Sibling rivalry ==
Fontaine and her elder sister, Olivia de Havilland, are the only siblings to have won lead acting Academy Awards. Olivia was the first to become an actress; when Fontaine tried to follow her lead, their mother, who favored Olivia, refused to let Joan use the family name. Subsequently, Fontaine had to invent a name, taking first Joan Burfield. When she appeared in the play &quot;Call It a Day&quot;, she was credited as Joan Fontaine, having assumed her mother&#x27;s (Lilian Fontaine) stage name. Biographer Charles Higham records that the sisters had an uneasy relationship from early childhood, when Olivia would rip up the clothes Joan had to wear as hand-me-downs, forcing Joan to sew them back together. A large part of the friction between the sisters stemmed from Fontaine&#x27;s belief that Olivia was their mother&#x27;s favorite child.

De Havilland and Fontaine were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1942. Fontaine won for her role in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Suspicion&quot; over deHavilland&#x27;s performance in &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot;. Higham states that Fontaine &quot;felt guilty about winning given her lack of obsessive career drive ...&quot;. Higham has described the events of the awards ceremony, stating that as Fontaine stepped forward to collect her award, she pointedly rejected deHavilland&#x27;s attempts to congratulate her and that deHavilland was both offended and embarrassed by her behaviour. Fontaine, however, tells a different story in her autobiography, explaining that she was paralyzed with surprise when she won the Academy Award, and that deHavilland insisted that she get up to accept it. &quot;Olivia took the situation very graciously&quot;, Fontaine wrote. &quot;I was appalled that I&#x27;d won over my sister.&quot; Several years later, however, deHavilland apparently remembered what she perceived as a slight and exacted her own revenge by brushing past Fontaine, who was waiting with her hand extended, because deHavilland took offense at a comment Fontaine had made about deHavilland&#x27;s husband.

Contrary to press reports, the sisters continued their relationship after the 1940s. After Fontaine&#x27;s separation from her husband in 1952, deHavilland went to her apartment in New York often, and at least once they spent Christmas together there, in 1961. They were photographed laughing together at a party for Marlene Dietrich in 1967. Fontaine also visited deHavilland in Paris in 1969.

The sisters reportedly did not completely stop speaking to each other until 1975, after their mother&#x27;s funeral, to which Joan, who was out of the country, was not invited.

Both sisters largely refused to comment publicly about their relationship. In a 1978 interview, however, Fontaine said of the sibling rivalry, &quot;I married first, won the Oscar before Olivia did, and if I die first, she&#x27;ll undoubtedly be livid because I beat her to it!&quot; The following year, in a 1979 interview, Fontaine claimed the reason her sister and she stopped speaking to each other was that deHavilland wanted their mother (who was suffering from cancer) to be treated surgically at the advanced age of 88, which Fontaine apparently did not think was a good idea. Fontaine claims that after their mother died, deHavilland did not bother to try to find where Fontaine could be reached (Fontaine was on tour in a play). Instead, deHavilland sent a telegram, which did not arrive until two weeks later at Fontaine&#x27;s next stop. According to Fontaine, deHavilland did not invite her to a memorial service for their mother. DeHavilland claims she informed Fontaine, but Fontaine brushed her off, claiming she was too busy to attend. Higham records that Fontaine had an estranged relationship with her own daughters, as well, possibly because she discovered that they were secretly maintaining a relationship with deHavilland.

== Personal life ==
Fontaine held dual citizenship; she was British by birthright (both her parents were British) and became an American citizen in April 1943. Outside of acting, Fontaine was also noted as being a licensed pilot, an accomplished interior decorator, and a Cordon Bleu–level chef.

She was married and divorced four times. Her first marriage was to actor Brian Aherne, in 1939, at the St. John&#x27;s Chapel in Del Monte, California; they divorced in April 1945.

In May 1946, she married actor/producer William Dozier in Mexico City. They had a daughter, Deborah Leslie, in 1948, and separated in 1949. Deborah is Fontaine&#x27;s only biological child. The following year, Fontaine filed for divorce, charging Dozier with desertion. Their divorce was final in January 1951. The two of them had a custody battle over their child which lingered through the 1950s.

Fontaine&#x27;s third marriage was to producer and writer Collier Young on November 12, 1952. They separated in May 1960, and Fontaine filed for divorce in November 1960. Their divorce was final in January 1961.

Fontaine&#x27;s fourth and final marriage was to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; golf editor Alfred Wright Jr, on January 23, 1964, in Elkton, Maryland; they divorced in 1969. Fontaine also had a personal relationship with politician Adlai Stevenson II: &quot;We had a tenderness for each other that grew into something rather serious. There was so much speculation about our marrying in the press that over lunch at his apartment in the Waldorf Towers he told me he could not marry an actress. He still had political ambitions and the &#x27;little old ladies from Oshkosh&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t approve. I told him it was just as well. My family would hardly approve of my marrying a politician&quot;.

Fontaine had an affair with actor and producer John Houseman after her marriage to Aherne. &quot;Ours was what was known in Hollywood as a &#x27;romance,&#x27; – which meant that we slept together three or four nights a week, got invited to parties together, went away together for weekends and sometimes talked about getting married without really meaning it,&quot; Houseman wrote in &quot;Front and Center&quot;, his second autobiography.

While in South America for a film festival in 1951, Fontaine met a four-year-old Peruvian girl named Martita, and informally adopted her. Fontaine met Martita while visiting Incan ruins where Martita&#x27;s father worked as a caretaker. Martita&#x27;s parents allowed Fontaine to become Martita&#x27;s legal guardian to give the child a better life. Fontaine promised Martita&#x27;s parents she would send the girl back to Peru to visit when she was 16 years old. When Martita turned 16, Fontaine bought her a round-trip ticket to Peru, but Martita refused to go and opted to run away. Fontaine and Martita became estranged following the incident. While promoting her autobiography in 1978, Fontaine addressed the issue, stating, &quot;Until my adopted daughter goes back to see her parents, she&#x27;s not welcome. I promised her parents. I do not forgive somebody who makes me break my word.&quot;

On December 15, 2013, Fontaine died in her sleep of natural causes at the age of 96 in her Carmel Highlands home. Her longtime friend Noel Beutel said, &quot;She had been fading in recent days and died peacefully.&quot; After Fontaine&#x27;s death, Olivia deHavilland released a statement saying she was &quot;shocked and saddened&quot; by the news.

Fontaine&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Actress in &quot;Suspicion&quot; was initially to be sold at an animal rights auction; however, the academy threatened to sue since it was not offered back to them for $1 and Fontaine&#x27;s estate retained possession.

Fontaine converted to Christianity in 1972 after a bleak period.

<doc id="180984" wikidata="Q236394" url="?curid=180984" title="Martha Scott">
<text>Martha Ellen Scott (September 22, 1912 – May 28, 2003) was an American actress. She was featured in major films such as Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), and William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), playing the mother of Charlton Heston&#x27;s character in both films. She originated the role of Emily Webb in Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot; on Broadway in 1938 and later recreated the role in the 1940 film version, for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

==Early life==
Scott was born in Jamesport, Missouri, the daughter of Letha (née McKinley) and Walter Alva Scott, an engineer and garage owner. Her mother was a second cousin of U.S. President William McKinley. The Scott family remained in Jamesport until Martha was 13 years old, when they moved to Kansas City, Missouri, and eventually to Detroit, Michigan. Scott became interested in acting in high school, an interest she furthered by attending the University of Michigan, earning a teaching certificate and a bachelor of arts degree in drama in 1934.

==Career==
===Stage===

Scott received a career boost right out of college, when she appeared with the Globe Theatre Troupe in a series of Shakespeare productions at the Century of Progress world&#x27;s fair in Chicago in 1934. Following that, she moved to New York City, where she found steady work both in stock stage productions and radio dramas. In 1938, she made her Broadway debut in the original staging of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s play &quot;Our Town&quot; as Emily Webb, the tragic young woman who dies in childbirth.

===Film===

Two years later, Scott reprised the role of Emily in her film debut when &quot;Our Town&quot; was made into a movie. Her critically acclaimed performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

Scott found steady movie work for the next four decades, appearing in major epics such as &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot;, and &quot;Airport 1975&quot;. Charlton Heston was a frequent co-star with Scott on both stage and screen. As she told an interviewer in 1988, &quot;I played his mother twice and his wife twice. I was his mother in &quot;Ben Hur&quot; and &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. I was his wife on the stage in New York in &quot;Design for a Stained Glass Window&quot; and &quot;The Tumbler in London&quot;.&quot;

===Producer===

In 1968, Scott joined Henry Fonda and Robert Ryan in forming a theatrical production company called the Plumstead Playhouse. It later became the Plumstead Theatre Company and moved to Los Angeles. The company produced &quot;First Monday in October&quot;, both on stage and on film. Scott co-produced both versions. Her last production was &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, which was performed at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood, California.

===Television===

Scott began appearing in TV roles in the medium&#x27;s early days. On November 2, 1950, she starred in &quot;The Cut Glass Bowl&quot; on &quot;The Nash Airflyte Theater&quot;, followed by several guest appearances on &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; and other shows of television&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot;, including two episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. This pattern of guest roles continued through the 1960s with appearances on &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, and &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;, among others. In the mid-1950s, Scott was the narrator for &quot;Modern Romances&quot;, an afternoon program on NBC-TV.

Scott was also a frequent TV guest star in the 1970s. She had recurring roles as Bob Newhart&#x27;s mother on &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, the mother of Colonel Steve Austin (Lee Majors) on both &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, as well as Patricia Shepard, Sue Ellen and Kristin&#x27;s mother on &quot;Dallas&quot; during its early years and later during the 1986 season. Scott was cast in single-episode guest appearances on several hit shows of the era, such as &quot;The Sandy Duncan Show&quot;, &quot;Columbo: Playback&quot; (1975), &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. She played the role of Jennifer Talbot, Terri Brock&#x27;s nasty grandmother, on &quot;General Hospital&quot; for six months (1986–1987), which ended when her character was murdered and stuffed in a drain pipe.

In the 1980s, she had a regular role on the short-lived series &quot;Secrets of Midland Heights&quot; and appeared in several television movies and in single episodes of shows such as &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;, and &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;. In the late 1980 she costarred with Jeffrey Lynn in an episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, which was a direct sequel to their 1949 feature film &quot;Strange Bargain&quot;. Scott&#x27;s final acting role on television was in 1990 in the movie &quot;Daughter of the Streets&quot;.

==Personal life==
Scott was married twice, first to radio producer and announcer Carleton William Alsop from 1940 to 1946, and then to jazz pianist and composer Mel Powell from 1946 until his death in 1998. She had one child with Alsop, son Carleton Scott Alsop, and two daughters—Mary Powell Harpel and Kathleen Powell—with her second husband. 

According to her son, Scott never forgot about her childhood hometown, using the mental image of a Jamesport cemetery in preparation for her Oscar-nominated role in &quot;Our Town&quot;. Said Alsop, &quot;She told me she used that place as her image because it&#x27;s so serene and beautiful&quot; and that her deceased McKinley and Scott relatives &quot;became the Gibbs and the Webbs in the play&quot;.

A Democrat, she supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

Scott died on May 28, 2003, in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, aged 90, from natural causes. She was interred next to Powell in the Masonic Cemetery in her native Jamesport, Missouri.

==Honors==
For her contribution in the theatre, Scott has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6126 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Ball of Fire (also known as The Professor and the Burlesque Queen) is a 1941 American screwball comedy film directed by Howard Hawks and starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck. The Samuel Goldwyn Productions film (originally distributed by RKO) concerns a group of professors laboring to write an encyclopedia and their encounter with a nightclub performer who provides her own unique knowledge. The supporting cast includes Oscar Homolka, S. Z. Sakall, Henry Travers, Richard Haydn, Dana Andrews, and Dan Duryea.

In 2016, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress, and selected for preservation in its National Film Registry. In 1948, Hawks recycled the plot for a musical film, &quot;A Song Is Born&quot;, this time starring Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo.

==Plot==
A group of professors, all bachelors except for one widower, have lived together for some years in a New York City residence, compiling an encyclopedia of all human knowledge. The youngest, Professor Bertram Potts, is a grammarian who is researching modern American slang. The professors are accustomed to working in relative seclusion at a leisurely pace with a prim housekeeper, Miss Bragg, keeping watch over them. Their impatient financial backer, Miss Totten, suddenly demands that they finish their work soon.
When a slang-using garbage man comes in asking the professors&#x27; assistance for a quiz, Bertram realizes he is far behind the latest uses of slangs and ventures out to do some independent research and becomes interested in the slang vocabulary of nightclub performer Katherine &quot;Sugarpuss&quot; O&#x27;Shea. She is reluctant to assist him until she suddenly needs a place to hide from the police, who want to question her about her boyfriend, mob boss Joe Lilac. Sugarpuss takes refuge in the house where the professors live and work, despite Bertram&#x27;s objections and their housekeeper&#x27;s threat to leave because of her. In the meantime, Joe decides to marry her, but only because as his wife she would not be able to testify against him.

The professors soon become fond of her, and she of them. Sugarpuss teaches them to conga and demonstrates to Bertram the meaning of the phrase &quot;yum yum&quot; (kisses). She becomes attracted to Bertram, who reciprocates by proposing marriage to her. She avoids giving him an answer and agrees to Joe&#x27;s plan to have the professors drive her to New Jersey to marry him. After a series of misadventures, including a car crash, Sugarpuss realizes that she is in love with Bertram, but is forced to go ahead with her marriage to Joe to save the professors from his henchmen. Bertram, meanwhile, unaware of Sugarpuss&#x27;s love for him, prepares to resume his research, sadder but wiser, until he discovers her true feelings.

The professors eventually outwit Joe and his henchmen and rescue Sugarpuss. She claims she is not good enough for Bertram, but his application of &quot;yum yum&quot; changes her mind. The other seven professors leave the room to give Bertram and Sugarpuss a moment alone.

==Cast==
==Music==

Martha Tilton provided Barbara Stanwyck&#x27;s singing voice for the song &quot;Drum Boogie&quot;. Drummer and bandleader Gene Krupa performed the song onscreen with his band. In an unusual twist, he also played it on a matchbox with matches for drumsticks. Krupa band member and noted trumpeter Roy Eldridge received a brief on-camera spot during &quot;Drum Boogie&quot;. At one point, the professors also perform an a cappella version of the 1869 song &quot;Sweet Genevieve&quot;.

==Production==
The script was written by Charles Brackett, Thomas Monroe, and Billy Wilder from a short story titled &quot;From A to Z&quot;, which Wilder had created while he was still in Europe. Partly inspired by the fairy tale &quot;Snow White&quot;, the professors were loosely based on the dwarfs from Walt Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. Although &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; was directed by the well-established Howard Hawks, Wilder had already decided that he needed to direct his screenplays to protect them from studio and other directors&#x27; interference. Hawks was happy to let Wilder study his directing on the set and Wilder thereafter directed his own films. The film was the second feature of 1941 to pair Cooper and Stanwyck, following &quot;Meet John Doe&quot;.

The role of Sugarpuss was offered to Ginger Rogers and Carole Lombard, but both turned it down. Lucille Ball was almost cast in the role until Gary Cooper recommended Stanwyck.

Wilder reveled in poking fun at those who took politics too seriously. At one point, Sugarpuss points to her sore throat and complains &quot;Slight rosiness? It&#x27;s as red as the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; [a left-wing newspaper] and just as sore.&quot;

Wilder also worked in a reference to Cooper&#x27;s Oscar-winning performance in the title role of Hawks&#x27;s 1941 film &quot;Sergeant York&quot; by having Dan Duryea&#x27;s character Duke Pastrami say, &quot;I saw me a movie last week&quot; before licking his thumb and rubbing it on the sight of his gun, a technique Cooper&#x27;s York uses to improve his marksmanship.

==Reception==
According to RKO records, &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; took in $1,856,000 in theater rentals from the United States and Canada and an additional $785,000 from foreign rentals, but, because of the terms of Sam Goldwyn&#x27;s deal with RKO, RKO recorded a loss of $147,000 on it.

&quot;Ball of Fire&quot; holds a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;A splendidly funny twist on the story of Snow White, &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; boasts a pair of perfect leads in Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck&quot;.

==Awards and honors==

&quot;Ball of Fire&quot; was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Barbara Stanwyck), Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic Picture, Best Sound, Recording (Thomas T. Moulton) and Best Story.

In World War II, a total of 12 servicemen were pen-pals with Stanwyck; two of them asked for a poster of her in the &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; outfit for their mess hall.

&quot;Ball of Fire&quot; was ranked 92nd in the 2000 American Film Institute (AFI) list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs. In a 1999 AFI poll, Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck were both ranked #11 on the male and female lists of the greatest American screen legends.
