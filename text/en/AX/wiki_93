<text>West Virginia University (WVU) is a public land-grant research university with its main campus in Morgantown, West Virginia, United States. Its other campuses are those of the West Virginia University Institute of Technology in Beckley, Potomac State College of West Virginia University in Keyser, and clinical campuses for the university&#x27;s medical school at the Charleston Area Medical Center and Eastern Campus in Martinsburg. WVU Extension Service provides outreach with offices in all 55 West Virginia counties.

Enrollment for the fall 2023 semester was 24,200 for the main campus, while enrollment across all three non-clinical campuses was 26,791. The Morgantown campus offers more than 350 bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, doctoral, and professional degree programs throughout 13 colleges and schools, including that state&#x27;s only law and dental schools. Faculty and alumni include 25 Truman Scholars, 47 Goldwater Scholars, 88 Gilman Scholars, 70 Fulbright Scholars, and 25 Rhodes Scholars.

==History==

===Establishment===
Under the terms of the 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, the West Virginia Legislature created the Agricultural College of West Virginia on February 7, 1867, and the school officially opened on September 2 of the same year. On December 4, 1868, lawmakers renamed the college West Virginia University to represent a broader range of higher education. It&#x27;s built on the grounds of three former academies, the Monongalia Academy of 1814, the Morgantown Female Academy of 1831, and Woodburn Female Seminary of 1858. Upon its founding, the local newspaper claimed that &quot;a place more eligible for the quiet and successful pursuit of science and literature is nowhere to be found&quot;.

The first campus building was constructed in 1870 as University Hall and was renamed Martin Hall in 1889 in honor of West Virginia University&#x27;s first president, the Rev. Alexander Martin of Scotland. After a fire destroyed the Woodburn Seminary building in 1873, the centerpiece of what is now Woodburn Hall was completed in 1876, under the name New Hall. The name was changed to University Building in 1878 when the College of Law was founded as the first professional school in the state of West Virginia. The precursor to Woodburn Circle was finished in 1893 when Chitwood Hall (then Science Hall) was constructed on the bluff&#x27;s north side. In 1909 a north wing was added to University Building, and the facility was renamed Woodburn Hall. Throughout the next decade, Woodburn Hall underwent several renovations and additions, including the construction of the south wing and east tower (in 1930) housing the Seth Thomas clock. The three Woodburn Circle buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In 1899, the Vance Farm was acquired for the West Virginia University Experiment Station. The Reymann Memorial Farm was given to West Virginia University in 1917 by the family of Anton Reymann of Wheeling in memory of Lawrence A. Reymann. The farm consisting of 990 acres located in Wardensville in Hardy County, comes until the Davis College of Agriculture.

WVU was required to have a Cadet Corps under the terms of the Morrill Act of 1862, which allowed for the creation of land-grant colleges. The United States Department of War—a predecessor of the U.S. Department of Defense—offered military equipment to the university at no charge, forming the basis of the school&#x27;s Military Tactics department. The heavy military influence led to opposition of female enrollment that lasted through the first decade of the university. The trend changed in 1889 when ten women were allowed to enroll and seek degrees at the university. In June 1891, Harriet Lyon became the first (white) woman to receive a degree from West Virginia University, finishing first in the class ahead of all male students. Lyon&#x27;s academic success supported the acceptance of women in the university as students and educators.
During the university&#x27;s early years, daily chapel services and roll call for all students were mandatory, limiting time for student recreation. Following the removal of these obligations, students became active in extracurricular activities and established many of the school&#x27;s first athletic and student organizations. The first edition of the student newspaper known as the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, now &quot;The Daily Athenaeum&quot;, was published in 1887, and the &quot;West Virginia Law Review&quot; became the fourth-oldest law review in the United States when it was founded in 1894. In 1897, E. Eva Hubbard (1858–1947) became the first head of WVU&#x27;s new Department of Art. Of Hubbard&#x27;s students was renowned Modernist Blanche Lazzell. Phi Kappa Psi was the first fraternity on campus, founded May 23, 1890, while Kappa Delta, the first sorority at WVU, was established in 1899. The first football team was formed in 1891, and the first basketball team appeared in 1903.

===Early 20th century===

The university&#x27;s outlook at the turn of the 20th century was optimistic, as the school constructed the first library in present-day Stewart Hall in 1902.

The campus welcomed U.S. President William Howard Taft to the campus for WVU President Thomas Hodges&#x27;s inauguration in 1911. On November 2, 1911, President Taft delivered the address &quot;World Wide Speech&quot;, from the front porch of Purinton House. However, the university&#x27;s efforts to attract more qualified educators, increase enrollment, and expand the campus was hindered during a period that saw two World Wars and the Great Depression. With a heavy military influence in the university, many students left college to join the army during World War I, and the local ROTC was organized in 1916. Women&#x27;s involvement in the war efforts at home led to the creation of Women&#x27;s Hall dormitory, now Stalnaker Hall, in 1918.

Despite its wartime struggles, the university established programs in biology, medicine, journalism, pharmacy, and the first mining program in the nation. In 1918, Oglebay Hall was built to house the expanded agriculture and forestry programs. Additionally, the first dedicated sports facilities were constructed including &quot;The Ark&quot; for basketball in 1918, and the original Mountaineer Field in 1925. Stansbury Hall was built in 1928 and included a new basketball arena named &quot;The Fieldhouse&quot; that held 6,000 spectators. Elizabeth Moore Hall, the woman&#x27;s physical education building, was also completed in 1928. Men&#x27;s Hall, the first dormitory built for men on campus, was built in 1935 and was funded in part by the Works Progress Administration.
The Mountaineer mascot (based on the mountain man) was adopted during the late 1920s, with an unofficial process to select the Mountaineer through 1936. An official selection process began naming the mascot annually in 1937, with Boyd &quot;Slim&quot; Arnold becoming the first Mountaineer to wear the buckskin uniform.

As male students left for World War II in 1941–42, women became more prominent in the university and surpassed the number of males on campus for the first time in 1943. Soldiers returning from the war qualified for the G.I. Bill and helped increase enrollment to over 8,000 students for the first time, but the university&#x27;s facilities were becoming inadequate to accommodate the surging student population.

===Campus expansion===

Preparation for the baby boomer generation and plans for curriculum expansion led to the purchase of land for the Evansdale and Medical campuses. The growth of downtown Morgantown limited the space available on the original campus; therefore, the new site was nearly two miles north on what had been farmland. Beginning in the late 1950s the university experienced the most rapid period of growth in its history. In 1957, WVU opened a Medical Center on the new campus and founded the first school of dentistry in West Virginia. The basketball program reached a new level of success when the university admitted future 14‑time NBA All-Star and Hall of Fame player Jerry West, who led the team to the national championship game in 1959. As enrollment approached 14,000 in the 1960s, the university continued expansion plans by building the Evansdale Residential Complex to house approximately 1,800 students, the Mountainlair student union, and several engineering and the creative arts facility on the Evansdale campus. In 1970 the WVU Coliseum, a basketball facility with a capacity of 14,000, opened near the new campus. As the facilities expanded, the university researched ways to move its growing student population across the split campuses and to solve its worsening traffic congestion. The resulting Personal Rapid Transit system opened in 1973 as the world&#x27;s first automated rapid transit system.

===Post-expansion and 21st century===
The student population continued to grow in the late 1970s, reaching 22,000. With no room for growth on the downtown campus, the football stadium was closed, and the new Mountaineer Field was opened near the Medical campus on September 6, 1980. Mountaineer Field would later be named Mountaineer Field at Milan Puskar Stadium. After an $8 million donation to the university, Ruby Memorial Hospital opened on the Medical campus in 1988, providing the state&#x27;s first level-one trauma center. Early the next year, the undefeated Mountaineer football team, led by Major Harris, made it to the national championship game before losing to Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl.

During the 1990s the university developed several recreational activities for students, including FallFest and WVU &quot;Up All Night&quot;. While the programs were created to provide safe entertainment for students and to combat WVU&#x27;s inclusion as one of the nation&#x27;s top party schools, they also garnered national attention as solutions for reducing alcohol consumption and partying on college campuses across the country. In 2001, a $34 million, recreation facility opened on the Evansdale campus, providing students with exercise facilities, recreational activities, and personal training programs.

WVU reached a new level of athletic success to start the new millennium. The football team featured a 3‑0 BCS bowl record, ten consecutive bowl game appearances, a #1 ranking in the &quot;USA Today&quot; Coaches&#x27; Poll, three consecutive 11‑win seasons amassing a 33–5 record, 41 consecutive weeks in the top 25, and 6 conference championships. The men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2007 NIT Championship and the 2010 Big East championship, while appearing four times in the sweet sixteen, twice in the elite-eight, and once in the final-four of the NCAA tournament. The athletic successes brought the university a new level of national exposure, and enrollment has since increased to nearly 30,000 students.

On April 24, 2008, the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reported the university had improperly granted an MBA to Heather Bresch, the daughter of the state&#x27;s governor Joe Manchin and an employee of Mylan, a pharmaceutical company whose then-chairman Milan Puskar was one of the university&#x27;s largest donors. In the aftermath, the university determined Bresch&#x27;s degree had been awarded without the prerequisite requirements having been met. They subsequently rescinded it, leading to the resignation of the president Michael Garrison, provost Gerald Lang, and business school dean Steve Sears. Garrison had been profiled as a trend toward non-traditional university presidents by the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; and &quot;Inside Higher Ed&quot;, but the Faculty Senate approved a vote of no confidence in the search that selected him. C. Peter McGrath was named interim president in August 2008. James P. Clements became WVU&#x27;s 23rd president on June 30, 2009. He had previously served as provost at Towson University. On September 16, 2009, Michele G. Wheatly was named Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. In November 2013, James P. Clements was selected to be Clemson University&#x27;s 15th president. E. Gordon Gee served as interim president and continues to serve as the president; this was Dr. Gee&#x27;s second time in this role, having first served as president of WVU in 1981.

On August 11, 2023, facing financial difficulties, a proposal to cut 7% of the university&#x27;s faculty and eliminate 32 major programs offered at its Morgantown campus was announced. These cuts will affect some humanities disciplines, including the entire Department of World Language, Literature and Linguistics, as well as some non-humanities programs, such as in pharmacy and engineering. Within the first week of fall classes, on August 21, 2023, hundreds of students staged a walkout and held rallies on Morgantown&#x27;s Downtown and Evansdale campuses to show opposition to the proposal. Participants wore red in honor of the striking coal miners who fought in the Battle of Blair Mountain. The event was organized by the West Virginia United Students&#x27; Union, which began organizing in response to potential reductions and discontinuations while the program reviews were still in process. Shortly thereafter, the WVU Faculty Assembly approved a vote of &quot;no confidence&quot; in President Gordon Gee.

==Campus==
The Morgantown campus comprises three sub-campuses. The original main campus, typically called the Downtown Campus, is in the Monongahela River valley on the fringes of downtown Morgantown. This part of the campus includes eight academic buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. The Downtown Campus comprises several architectural styles predominantly featuring red brick including Victorian Second Empire, Federal, Neoclassical, and Collegiate Gothic among others. The Evansdale Campus, a mile and a half north-northwest, on a rise above the flood plain of the Monongahela River, was developed in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate a growing student population since space for expansion was limited at the Downtown Campus. The Health Sciences Campus, in the same outlying area (but on the other side of a ridge), includes the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center, the Erma Byrd Biomedical Research Facility, Ruby Memorial Hospital, Chestnut Ridge Hospital, Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, WVU Healthcare Physicians Office Center, Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute, WVU Eye Institute, and the WVU Children&#x27;s Hospital.

The Health Sciences Campus is near Mountaineer Field, over a ridge from the Evansdale Campus.

===Core Arboretum===
The Core Arboretum is a 91-acre (37 ha) arboretum owned by West Virginia University and on Monongahela Boulevard in Morgantown, West Virginia. It is open to the public daily without charge.

The Arboretum&#x27;s history began in 1948 when the university acquired its site. Professor Earl Lemley Core (1902–1984), chairman of the Biology Department, then convinced President Irvin Stewart to set the property aside for the study of biology and botany. In 1975 the Arboretum was named in Core&#x27;s honor.

The Arboretum is now managed by the WVU Department of Biology and consists of mostly old-growth forests on steep hillside and Monongahela River floodplain. It includes densely wooded areas with 3.5 miles (5.6 km) of walking trails, as well as 3 acres (12,000 m2) of lawn planted with specimen trees.

The Arboretum has a variety of natural habitats in which several hundred species of native WV trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants may be found. Some of the large trees are likely over 200 years old.

===Campus safety===
The university created WVU Alert, a text-based alert system for quickly disseminating emergency situations to faculty, staff, and students. WVU also uses LiveSafe, a smart phone application that enables users to anonymously report crimes or safety concerns, or to use the walk safe feature which allows the user to invite a friend to monitor their location while they walk. Additionally, there are 37, easily accessible, blue-lit towers housing emergency phones across the WVU campuses that automatically dial 911 in the event of an emergency.

The West Virginia University Police Department (UPD) is the largest campus police department in the state and the only campus law enforcement agency in the state accredited by the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators. The UPD has a sworn officer operations division, a central communication unit, a student cadet unit, investigations, K-9 teams and other support services. Officers have the same authority and powers as city and county police officers.

===Transportation===
Due to the distance between WVU&#x27;s three campuses, the university built the innovative Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system to link the campuses (Downtown, Evansdale, and Health Sciences) and reduce student traffic on local highways. Boeing began construction on the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system in 1972. The unique aspect that makes the system &quot;personal&quot; is that a rider specifies their destination when entering the system and, depending on the system load, the PRT can dispatch a car that will travel directly to that station.

The PRT began operation in 1973, with U.S. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s daughter, Tricia, aboard one of five prototype cars for a demonstration ride. The PRT handles 16,000 riders per day () and uses approximately 70 cars.

The system has of guideway track and five stations: Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, and Medical/Health Sciences. The vehicles are rubber-tired, but the cars have constant contact with a separate electrified rail. Steam heating keeps the elevated guideway free of snow and ice. Although most students use the PRT, this technology has not been replicated at other sites for various reasons, including the high cost of maintaining the heated track system in winter.

The PRT cars are painted in school colors (blue with gold trim) and feature the university name and logo on the front. Inside, the seats are light beige fiberglass and the carpeting is blue. Each car has eight seats with an overall capacity of 20 people, including standing room.

The National Society of Professional Engineers named the WVU PRT one of the top 10 engineering achievements of 1972, and in 1997 &quot;The New Electric Railway Journal&quot; picked the WVU PRT as the best people mover in North America (for 1996).

In 2006 the U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency dubbed WVU one of the best workplaces for commuters.

Each autumn, during Mountaineer Week celebrations, a special PRT car is placed in front of the Mountainlair student union where groups of students participate in the &quot;PRT Cram&quot; with the objective of squeezing in as many people as possible. A record of 97 was set in 2000.

The PRT has become a cultural mainstay of the WVU campus. However, it is not without problems. One student was seriously injured in 2020 when a boulder collapsed onto the track, smashing a cart. Two more students had to be transported to Ruby Memorial Hospital.

===Divisional campuses===
WVU has two divisional campuses:
*Potomac State College of West Virginia University in Keyser
*West Virginia University Institute of Technology in Beckley

West Virginia University at Parkersburg, a primarily 2-year school, was a regional campus of WVU but has been independent since 2009.

==Academics==

===Reputation and rankings===

WVU is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. According to the National Science Foundation, WVU spent $185.1 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 121st in the nation. WVU is affiliated with the Rockefeller Neurosciences Institute, dedicated to the study of Alzheimer&#x27;s and other diseases that affect the brain. WVU is also a leader in biometric technology research and the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s lead academic partner in biometrics research.

===Admissions===
Freshman West Virginia resident applicants must have a 2.0 GPA and either an SAT super score of 990 of 1600 or an ACT super score of 19 of 36. For non-residents the requirements are a GPA of 2.5 and either a super score SAT 1060 or a super score ACT of 21. College and program admission requirements for first-time freshmen vary by program. The general freshman acceptance rate at WVU is 71.9% of applications received with an average entering student GPA of 3.42, an SAT super score of 1115 of 1600, and an ACT super score of 24 of 36.

In the fall of 2020, the university relaxed its test score requirements for students applying for admission in response to the coronavirus pandemic. According to WVU assistant vice president of Enrollment Management George Zimmerman, if students are unable to take the SAT or ACT, they will still be admitted to WVU as long as they have shown academic ability in other areas of their application. The policy is said to be in effect until spring 2023.

WVU&#x27;s forensics and investigative science program was originally created through a partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The program is accredited by the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and is the official library holdings repository for the International Association for Identification. The program includes three main areas of emphasis, the examiner track, which specializes in crime scene investigation and comparison sciences, the biology track, which specializes in body fluids and DNA analysis, and the chemistry track, which specializes in the chemical identification of seized drugs, fire debris, trace evidence and explosives. Facilities include four &quot;crime-scene&quot; houses, a vehicle processing garage, a ballistics laboratory, and numerous traditional laboratories and classrooms in Ming Hsieh Hall and Oglebay Hall. A separate Criminology &amp; Investigative Sciences major was later added to the Eberly College of Arts and Sciences. The College of Business and Economics also provides a certificate in forensic accounting and fraud examination.

WVU robotics teams have won several international competitions such as the NASA Robotic Mining Competition and the NASA/NIA RASC-AL Exploration Robot-OPS Challenge. In 2016, a WVU team led by Dr. Yu Gu won the final NASA Sample Return Robot Centennial Challenge with a $750,000 prize.

Biometrics is an engineering-centric field of study offered at WVU, the first institution in the world to establish a Bachelor of Science degree in Biometric Systems. In 2003 the university also founded the initial chapter of the Student Society for the Advancement of Biometrics (SSAB). The program, in the Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (LCSEE), provides a firm understanding of the underlying electrical engineering and computer engineering disciplines that support biometric applications. On February 6, 2008, WVU became the national academic leader for the FBI&#x27;s biometric research. WVU is also the founding site for the Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR), focusing on biometrics and identification technology. CITeR maintains and develops collaborative relationships with other academic institutions to meet research needs.
The Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center is on West Virginia University&#x27;s Evansdale Campus and houses the Schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy. These schools grant doctoral and professional degrees in 16 different fields, as well as a variety of other Master&#x27;s and Bachelor&#x27;s degrees. For 2012 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked WVU&#x27;s Medical School ninth in the United States for rural medicine.

Also on the Health Sciences Campus is WVU&#x27;s local teaching hospital, Ruby Memorial Hospital, which is one of only two designated Trauma I hospitals in the state.

===Libraries===

The West Virginia University Libraries encompasses seven libraries and the WVU Press, including the Downtown Campus Library, Evansdale Library, Health Sciences Library (Morgantown), Law Library, Health Sciences Library (Charleston), the Mary F. Shipper Library at Potomac State College in Keyser, the Beckley Library at the WVU Institute of Technology, and the West Virginia and Regional History Center (the world&#x27;s largest collection of West Virginia-related research material), is in the Wise Library on the Downtown Campus. Collections include the Appalachian Collection, Digital Collections, Government Documents, Map Collection, Myers Collection, Patent and Trademarks, Rare Books Collections, and Theses and Dissertations.

==Student life==
===Events===
FallFest welcomes students to the university by providing an evening of entertainment and musical performances traditionally held during the first week of the fall semester and traditionally at the Mountainlair Student Union. The event began in 1995 as a safe alternative to partying and has become one of the largest University-sponsored events, typically drawing crowds of 15,000 or more. The celebration has been highlighted by a series of evening concerts by renowned artists. A dance party, film festival, comedy show, and several indoor musical performances are also featured.

Mountaineer Week is a celebration of WVU tradition and Appalachian heritage that began in 1947. Festivities have expanded to include competitions among WVU students, designed to honor school and state pride. A beard-growing competition introduced in 1949 has continued throughout the event&#x27;s history. Participants must shave before the panel of judges that also chooses the winner at the end of the competition. The Mr. and Ms. Mountaineer competition has been included in Mountaineer Week since 1962,
honoring one male and one female student who show &quot;outstanding school spirit, academic excellence, and extracurricular involvement&quot;. The annual PRT Cram features the unique PRT system, where students compete to fit the maximum number of riders on a special-model PRT car with the windows removed. The record was set in 2000 when 97 students fit inside one PRT car.

The Lighting of Woodburn Hall is an annual university ceremony held in early December to light historic Woodburn Hall for the holiday season. The event began in 1987 and is open to the public. Christmas carols are typically sung and donations are taken at the event to support community organizations. Patients from WVU&#x27;s Children&#x27;s hospital are often selected to light the Hall.

Fall Family Weekend is an opportunity for students&#x27; family members to experience WVU campus life by attending classes, athletic events, college presentations, and student events such as WVU &quot;Up All Night&quot;. Tours of the campus facilities are offered by individual colleges and organizations,
including tours of the PRT.

Homecoming weekend activities include the Alumni Band-led homecoming parade through downtown Morgantown, the crowning of the royalty, and a football game with a performance by the WVU Alumni band. Student organizations participate in the parade by designing floats. Receptions are held by colleges, student groups, and the alumni center.

Greek Week is held during the spring semester, providing a venue for competition between Greek organizations. Highlights include airband events, where organizations compete in cheerleading and dance routines, and sports competitions on the Mountainlair recreational field. The competitions strive to highlight WVU&#x27;s student spirit and present a positive image of the fraternities and sororities.

===Recreation===

The Mountainlair Student Union, commonly called &quot;the Lair&quot; by students, is the three-floor student union building at WVU. The building dates to 1968 and replaced an earlier structure built in 1948. The student union offers many recreational opportunities to students including a movie theater, bowling alley, pool hall, ballrooms, video game arcade, a cafeteria-style restaurant, and a collection of fast food restaurants.

The Student Recreation Center is a recreation facility that opened before the 2001 academic year with an initial construction cost of $34 million. The facility offers a six-lane swimming pool, 20‑seat spa, of cardio and free-weight equipment, an elevated running track, basketball courts,
volleyball and badminton courts, glass squash and racquetball courts, and a climbing wall. The center also offers a variety of wellness programs, personal training, child care services, exercise classes, and intramural activities.

The Mountaineer Adventure Program (MAP) offers several activities including Adventure WV, Challenge Course, and International Trips. Adventure WV is focused on providing guidance to freshmen and sophomores through various outdoor orientation expeditions. The Challenge Course program uses a recreational facility designed to teach teamwork and problem-solving skills through physical interaction. International Trips offers worldwide recreational opportunities to places like Fiji and Peru, as well as study abroad credit courses. Several of the MAP programs provide University-accepted credit hours.

The Outdoor Recreation Center, a division of the Student Recreation Center, helps students find recreational activities locally and in other parts of West Virginia. The center sponsors some trips, including whitewater rafting on the Cheat River and hiking in the Monongahela National Forest. Students can take advantage of West Virginia&#x27;s natural wilderness by renting outdoor recreational equipment for hiking, camping, climbing, fishing, biking, skiing, and whitewater rafting, all of which is available with minimal travel time. WVU&#x27;s main campus is next to the Monongahela River along which runs the Caperton Trail, also known as the &quot;Rail Trail&quot;, a paved path for walking, running, or biking. Other connecting trails total in additional length, extending from the Pennsylvania border to Prickett&#x27;s Fort State Park. Many student groups take day trips to the nearby Coopers Rock State Forest, which is less than from WVU&#x27;s campus.

===Student organizations===
West Virginia University offers more than 400 student-run organizations and clubs. Many of the organizations are associated with academia, religion, culture, military service, politics, recreation, or sports.

====Fraternities and sororities====

There are several fraternities and sororities on campus.

Fraternity controversies

In 2014, 18-year-old Kappa Sigma pledge Nolan Burch died during a hazing incident at the fraternity house. Police say his blood-alcohol level was 0.493% at the time of his death. A lawsuit was settled over the student&#x27;s death in 2018 for $250,000.

In 2019, City Drive Studios produced the documentary &quot;Breathe, Nolan, Breathe&quot;, which details what led up to Nolan&#x27;s death. The film begins with security footage inside the Kappa Sigma house, showing a fraternity brother performing CPR on Nolan&#x27;s limp body hours after he was dragged inside. The brother kept repeating the words, &quot;breathe, Nolan, breathe.&quot; Video also shows fraternity brothers taking videos of Burch lying on a wooden plank and kicking him. According to City Drive Studios, &quot;The purpose of this film is to stop this from ever happening again and to save lives.&quot;

In 2018 several WVU fraternities chose to disassociate themselves after the school sent out stricter rules and regulations for Greek life. For example, Sigma Chi was restricted to one social event per semester. David Coram of Sigma Chi says this was one of the main reasons the fraternity decided to disassociate. WVU also decided to raise the required GPA for rushing students from 2.5 to 2.75. For Farris, the biggest concern with the breakaway is student safety, reports the WV Gazette-Mail. He explained how the university would not be able to help in situations such as an injury or sexual assault if they were not recognized by the school.

2018 brought another fraternity incident as, according to WVU, senior finance major David Rusko, 22, fell down steps and was knocked unconscious at the fraternity house where he was visiting after a football game. An investigation found two hours elapsed between the fall and when medical help was sought. West Virginia University announced that three students were no longer enrolled at the university and 15 others agreed to other disciplinary action as a result.

===Student media===
The Daily Athenaeum, nicknamed &quot;the DA&quot;, is the 9th-largest newspaper in West Virginia. Offered free on campus, it generates income through advertisements and student fees. The paper began in 1887 as a weekly literary magazine, with writing, editing and production taken over by the newly formed School of Journalism in the 1920s. In 1970, the paper split from the School of Journalism and became an independent campus entity governed by the Student Publications Board. &quot;The DA&quot; was voted as the &quot;Princeton Review&quot;″s 10th-best college newspaper in the United States in 2005, 15th in 2006, and 8th in 2007.

WWVU-FM, called U92 or The Moose, plays new music, talk shows, and newscasts. On the air since 1982, U92 can be heard in the Morgantown area at 91.7 FM and also streams live on the internet. In 2007 the station was one of four college radio stations nominated for College Music Journal&#x27;s Station of the Year Award. In 2015 CMJ awarded the station with three awards including Station of the Year.

===Student health===
The Student Center of Health, also known under the label &quot;WELLWVU&quot;, provides services related to student health, disease prevention, and awareness. The Carruth Center for Psychological and Psychiatric Services offers therapy to any WVU student. The Robert C. Byrd Health Science Center and the associated West Virginia University Hospitals, on the Health Science Campus, serve as West Virginia&#x27;s largest healthcare institution. The hospitals provide a comprehensive set of healthcare needs for local and regional patients. WVU students have full access to healthcare resources, which are accessible from the PRT towers station.

====WVU Student Health Services====
Starting with the Fall 2014 semester WVU implemented a mandatory student health insurance policy, with an opt-out. All domestic students at West Virginia University and WVU Tech, enrolled in 6 or more credit hours and international students enrolled in 1 or more credit hours will be required to carry health insurance coverage.

With the opening of the new Student Health and Wellness building on the Evansdale Campus, WVU Medical Corporation now operates the medical services of Student Health. This is a WVU Urgent Care Clinic office and is the primary care provider to students who use WVU&#x27;s Aetna Health Insurance policy. The Clinic is open 7 days a week.

===Mental Health Record===
As of the end of the Spring 2020 semester, two students died by suicide after not being able to seek counseling at the Carruth Center for Mental Health. There have also been numerous accounts of a culture of alcoholism and mental illness.

===Arts and entertainment===
WVU Arts &amp; Entertainment (A&amp;E) sponsors entertainment events for students throughout the academic year. The department organizes the annual FallFest event, which features popular musicians, comedians, and other performers. WVU A&amp;E annually hosts several concerts at the WVU Coliseum and Canady Creative Arts Center, with past performances by Akon, The All-American Rejects, The Fray, Kelly Clarkson, Ludacris, Maroon 5, Reba McEntire, Willie Nelson, and 50 Cent among others. The Canady Creative Arts Center was constructed in 1967, it included a new Möller pipe organ.

The West Virginia Public Theater (WVPT) is one of two professional musical theaters in West Virginia. The group is near WVU&#x27;s campus and performs several Broadway numbers yearly.

The Art Museum of West Virginia University features touring exhibitions and displays a collection including over 2,500 works of art from the Appalachian region, Asia, and Africa.

The Royce J. and Caroline B. Watts Museum, on the Evansdale campus, features tools, equipment, artifacts, photos, and other items related to West Virginia&#x27;s coal and petroleum industries.

==Athletics==

The school&#x27;s sports teams are called the Mountaineers and compete in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I. The school has teams in 17 college sports and has won several national championships, including 19 NCAA Rifle Championships . Formerly a full member of the Big East Conference in all sports, on October 28, 2011, the school accepted an invitation to join the Big 12 Conference and became a member on July 1, 2012.

Notable athletes from West Virginia University include Ashley Lawrence, Jerry West, Jim Braxton, Marc Bulger, Avon Cobourne, Mike Compton, Noel Devine, Cecil Doggette, D&#x27;or Fischer, Mike Gansey, Marc &quot;Major&quot; O. Harris, Chris Henry, Joe Herber, Jeff Hostetler, Chuck Howley, Sam Huff, Darryl Talley, &quot;Hot Rod&quot; Hundley, Adam &quot;Pacman&quot; Jones, Joe Stydahar, Dan Mozes, Kevin Pittsnogle, Jerry Porter, Todd Sauerbrun, Steve Slaton, Ray Gaddis, Rod Thorn, Oliver Luck, Mike Vanderjagt, Pat White, Quincy Wilson, Amos Zereoué, Greg Jones, Joe Alexander, Owen Schmitt, Georgann Wells, Geno Smith, Ginny Thrasher, Pat McAfee, Tavon Austin, Miles McBride, and Jedd Gyorko.

===Football===

WVU has had two undefeated regular seasons; they went 11–0 in 1988 and 1993. However, West Virginia lost both bowl games, 34‑21 to Notre Dame in the National Championship, and 41–7 to Florida. The 2005 season and the 2006 season produced the first consecutive 11-win seasons in school history. In the 2007 season, the Mountaineers started the season as the #3-ranked team, the highest preseason ranking in school history. That team eventually was ranked #1 in the Coaches Poll and finished the season with a third consecutive 11-win season after their Fiesta Bowl victory.

===Basketball===

West Virginia men&#x27;s basketball has competed in three basketball championship final matches: the 1959 NCAA final, the 1942 NIT final (at that time, the NIT was considered more prestigious than the NCAA), and the 2007 NIT Championship. They lost to California in the 1959 NCAA finals, while the Mountaineers won the 1942 NIT Championship over Western Kentucky, and the 2007 NIT contest over Clemson. In 1949 future Mountaineers head coach, Fred Schaus, became the first player in NCAA history to record 1,000 points.

Recently, West Virginia reached the Final Four of the 2010 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament, led by West Virginia coach and former WVU player Bob Huggins. The Mountaineers won the 2010 Big East men&#x27;s basketball tournament and received a #2 seed in the East Region of the 2010 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

In 2015, West Virginia reached the Sweet Sixteen of the 2015 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. They were eliminated from the tournament after losing to Kentucky. In 2018, West Virginia again reached the Sweet Sixteen of the 2018 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. They were eliminated from the tournament after losing in the fourth round to #1 seed and eventual champion Villanova.

===Soccer===
Since joining the Big 12 Conference ahead of the 2012 season, West Virginia women&#x27;s soccer has posted a 27–1–3 record in regular-season league games. In 2016, the Mountaineers claimed their fifth consecutive outright regular-season league championship, becoming the first team in Big 12 history to accomplish that feat. West Virginia also won back-to-back Big 12 tournament championships in 2013 and 2014, as well as two additional Big 12 tournament championships in 2016 and 2018. The Mountaineers are coached by Nikki Izzo-Brown, the program&#x27;s only head coach.

West Virginia men&#x27;s soccer competes in the Sun Belt Conference.

===Rifle===
With a total of 26 individual NCAA National Champions and 19 team NCAA National Championship titles, West Virginia University&#x27;s rifle team is the most successful rifle program in the history of the NCAA. Their most recent National Championship as a team was won in 2017. The Mountaineers compete in the Great America Rifle Conference where they have won 11 regular-season conference championships. The team&#x27;s home matches take place at the WVU Rifle Range which opened in 2010. Virginia Thrasher, who won a gold medal in the women&#x27;s 10-meter air rifle at the 2016 Summer Olympics, was on the Mountaineers rifle team from 2015 to 2019.

===Marching band===

The West Virginia University Mountaineer Marching Band is nicknamed &quot;The Pride of West Virginia.&quot; The 340-member band performs at every home football game and makes several local and national appearances throughout the year.

===Fanbase===

In a state that lacks professional sports franchises, West Virginians passionately support West Virginia University and its athletics teams. Men&#x27;s basketball head coach Bob Huggins, a former Mountaineer basketball player who was born in Morgantown, stated that the &quot;strong bond between the university and the people of West Virginia&quot; is a relationship that is difficult for non-natives to understand.

Some WVU fans, primarily in the student sections, better known as the &quot;Mountaineer Maniacs&quot; have developed a reputation for unruly behavior, being compared to &quot;soccer hooligans&quot;
by &quot;GQ&quot; magazine. At some events, there have been cases of objects thrown onto the field or at opposing teams. There were also issues with small-scale fires, most notably of couches, being set after games; over 1,100 intentionally ignited street fires were reported from 1997 to 2003.

Members of the Morgantown-area community volunteered as Goodwill City Ambassadors for the first time in the fall of 2012 to welcome visiting fans to the football games. The Goodwill City initiative is a collaborative effort of the City of Morgantown, WVU, Morgantown&#x27;s &quot;Dominion Post&quot;, and community residents.

==Pageantry==

The Mountaineer was adopted in 1890 as the official school mascot and unofficially began appearing at sporting events in 1936. A new Mountaineer is selected each year during the final two men&#x27;s home basketball games, with the formal title &quot;The Mountaineer of West Virginia University&quot;. The new Mountaineer receives a scholarship, a tailor-made buckskin suit with a coonskin hat, and a period rifle and powder horn for discharging when appropriate and safe. The mascot travels with most sports teams throughout the academic year. While not required, male mascots traditionally grow a beard.

The &quot;Flying WV&quot; is the most widely used logo in West Virginia athletics. It debuted in 1980 as a part of a football uniform redesign by Coach Don Nehlen, and was adopted as the official logo for the university in 1983.
While the &quot;Flying WV&quot; represents all university entities, unique logos are occasionally used for individual departments. Some examples include the script West Virginia logo for the WVU Department of Intercollegiate Athletics and the interlocking WV logo used in baseball.

Fight songs of West Virginia University include &quot;Hail, West Virginia&quot; and &quot;Fight Mountaineers&quot;. The West Virginia University Alma Mater was composed in 1937, and is sung before every home football game. The crowd sings along as the WVU Marching Band stands playing it on the field, as part of the pregame show.

&quot;Old gold and blue&quot;, the official University colors, were selected by the upperclassmen of 1890 from the West Virginia state seal. While the official school colors are old gold and blue, brighter gold is used in official university logos and merchandise. This change in color scheme is often cited for the lack of a universal standard for colors during the 19th century when the university&#x27;s colors were selected. Additionally, the brighter gold is argued to create a more intimidating environment for sporting events. The university accepts &quot;gold and blue&quot; for the color scheme, but states clearly that the colors are not &quot;blue and gold&quot;, to distinguish West Virginia from its rival, the University of Pittsburgh.

===Sporting traditions===

The unofficial song of the university, &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; by John Denver, became an official West Virginia state song on March 8, 2014.
In 1980 John Denver performed his hit song &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; at the dedication of Mountaineer Field, and it has since become a tradition for fans to remain in the stands following every Mountaineer victory and sing the song with the players. Although the tradition originated during football games, it is now recognized throughout the university, with the song performed at various athletic events and ceremonies. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named the singing of &quot;Country Roads&quot; as one of the must-see college traditions.

The Pride of West Virginia is the official marching band of the university. The band&#x27;s football pre-game show includes traditions such as the Drumline&#x27;s &quot;Tunnel&quot; and &quot;Boogie&quot; cadences, the 220‑beat per minute run-on cadence to start the performance, marching the &quot;WV&quot; logo down the field to the university fight song, &quot;Fight Mountaineers&quot;, expanding circles during &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;, and the formation of the state&#x27;s outline during &quot;Hail, West Virginia&quot;.

The Firing of the Rifle is a tradition carried out by the Mountaineer Mascot to open several athletic events. The Mountaineer points the gun into the air with one arm and fires a blank shot from a custom rifle, a signal to the crowd to begin cheering at home football and basketball games. The Mountaineer also fires the rifle every time the team scores during football games.

The Carpet Roll is a WVU Men&#x27;s Basketball tradition. In 1955 Fred Schaus and Alex Mumford devised the idea of rolling out an elaborate gold and blue carpet for Mountaineer basketball players to use when taking the court for pre-game warm-ups. In addition, Mountaineer players warmed up with a special gold and blue basketball. The university continued this tradition until the late 1960s when it died out, but former Mountaineer player Gale Catlett reintroduced the carpet when he returned to West Virginia University in 1978 as head coach of the men&#x27;s basketball team.

<text>A home appliance, also referred to as a domestic appliance, an electric appliance or a household appliance, is a machine which assists in household functions such as cooking, cleaning and food preservation.

The domestic application attached to home appliance is tied to the definition of appliance as &quot;an instrument or device designed for a particular use or function&quot;. &quot;Collins English Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;home appliance&quot; as: &quot;devices or machines, usually electrical, that are in your home and which you use to do jobs such as cleaning or cooking&quot;. The broad usage allows for nearly any device intended for domestic use to be a home appliance, including consumer electronics as well as stoves, refrigerators, toasters and air conditioners.

The development of self-contained electric and gas-powered appliances, an American innovation, emerged in the early 20th century. This evolution is linked to the decline of full-time domestic servants and desire to reduce household chores, allowing for more leisure time. Early appliances included washing machines, water heaters, refrigerators, and sewing machines. The industry saw significant growth post-World War II, with the introduction of dishwashers and clothes dryers. By the 1980s, the appliance industry was booming, leading to mergers and antitrust legislation. The US National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 mandated a 25% reduction in energy consumption every five years. By the 1990s, five companies dominated over 90% of the market.

Major appliances, often called white goods, include items like refrigerators and washing machines, while small appliances encompass items such as toasters and coffee makers. Product design shifted in the 1960s, embracing new materials and colors. Consumer electronics, often referred to as brown goods, include items like TVs and computers. There is a growing trend towards home automation and internet-connected appliances. Recycling of home appliances involves dismantling and recovering materials.

== History ==
While many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the early twentieth century. The development of these appliances is tied to the disappearance of full-time domestic servants and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities in pursuit of more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included washing machines, water heaters, refrigerators, kettles and sewing machines. The invention of Earl Richardson&#x27;s small electric clothes iron in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry. In the Post–World War II economic expansion, the domestic use of dishwashers, and clothes dryers were part of a shift for convenience. Increasing discretionary income was reflected by a rise in miscellaneous home appliances.

In America during the 1980s, the industry shipped $1.5 billion worth of goods each year and employed over 14,000 workers, with revenues doubling between 1982 and 1990 to $3.3 billion. Throughout this period, companies merged and acquired one another to reduce research and production costs and eliminate competitors, resulting in antitrust legislation.

The United States Department of Energy reviews compliance with the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987, which required manufacturers to reduce the energy consumption of the appliances by 25% every five years.

In the 1990s, the appliance industry was very consolidated, with over 90% of the products being sold by just five companies. For example, in 1991, dishwasher manufacturing market share was split between General Electric with 40% market share, Whirlpool with 31%, Electrolux with 20%, Maytag with 7% and Thermador with just 2%.

== Major appliances ==

Major appliances, also known as white goods, comprise major household appliances and may include: air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes dryers, drying cabinets, freezers, refrigerators, kitchen stoves, water heaters, washing machines, trash compactors, microwave ovens, and induction cookers. White goods were typically painted or enameled white, and many of them still are.

== Small appliances ==


Small appliances are typically small household electrical machines, also very useful and easily carried and installed. Yet another category is used in the kitchen, including: juicers, electric mixers, meat grinders, coffee grinders, deep fryers, herb grinders, food processors, electric kettles, waffle irons, coffee makers, blenders, rice cookers, toasters and exhaust hoods.

== Product design ==

In the 1960s the product design for appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators, and electric toasters shifted away from Streamline Moderne and embraced technological advances in the fabrication of sheet metal. A choice in color, as well as fashionable accessory, could be offered to the mass market without increasing production cost. Home appliances were sold as space-saving ensembles.

== Consumer electronics ==

Consumer electronics (or home electronics) are electronic (analog or digital) equipment intended for everyday use, typically in private homes. Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment, communications and recreation. In British English, they are often called &quot;brown goods&quot; by producers and sellers, to distinguish them from &quot;white goods&quot; which are meant for housekeeping tasks, such as washing machines and refrigerators, although nowadays, these could be considered brown goods, some of these being connected to the Internet. Some such appliances were traditionally finished with genuine or imitation wood, hence the name. This has become rare but the name has stuck, even for goods that are unlikely ever to have had a wooden case (e.g. camcorders). In the 2010s, this distinction is absent in large big box consumer electronics stores, which sell both entertainment, communication, and home office devices and kitchen appliances such as refrigerators. The highest selling consumer electronics products are compact discs. Examples are: home electronics, radio receivers, TV sets, VCRs, CD and DVD players, digital cameras, camcorders, still cameras, clocks, alarm clocks, computers, video game consoles, HiFi and home cinema, telephones and answering machines.

== Life spans ==
A survey conducted in 2020 of more than thirteen thousand people in the UK revealed how long appliance owners had their appliances before needing to replace them due to a fault, deteriorating performance, or the age of the appliance.

== Home automation ==

There is a trend of networking home appliances together, and combining their controls and key functions. For instance, energy distribution could be managed more evenly so that when a washing machine is on, an oven can go into a delayed start mode, or vice versa. Or, a washing machine and clothes dryer could share information about load characteristics (gentle/normal, light/full), and synchronize their finish times so the wet laundry does not have to wait before being put in the dryer.

Additionally, some manufacturers of home appliances are quickly beginning to place hardware that enables Internet connectivity in home appliances to allow for remote control, automation, communication with other home appliances, and more functionality enabling connected cooking. Internet-connected home appliances were especially prevalent during recent Consumer Electronics Show events.

== Recycling ==

Appliance recycling consists of dismantling waste home appliances and scrapping their parts for reuse. The main types of appliances that are recycled are T.V.s, refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, and computers. It involves disassembly, removal of hazardous components and destruction of the equipment to recover materials, generally by shredding, sorting and grading.

<doc id="185984" wikidata="Q25900" url="?curid=185984" title="Leporidae">
<text>Leporidae () is the family of rabbits and hares, containing over 70 species of extant mammals in all. The Latin word &quot;Leporidae&quot; means &quot;those that resemble &quot;lepus&quot;&quot; (hare). Together with the pikas, the Leporidae constitute the mammalian order Lagomorpha. Leporidae differ from pikas in that they have short, furry tails and elongated ears and hind legs.

The common name &quot;rabbit&quot; usually applies to all genera in the family except &quot;Lepus&quot;, while members of &quot;Lepus&quot; (almost half the species) usually are called hares. Like most common names, however, the distinction does not match current taxonomy completely; jackrabbits are members of &quot;Lepus&quot;, and members of the genera &quot;Pronolagus&quot; and &quot;Caprolagus&quot; sometimes are called hares.

Various countries across all continents except Antarctica and Australia have indigenous species of Leporidae. Furthermore, rabbits, most significantly the European rabbit, &quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;, also have been introduced to most of Oceania and to many other islands, where they pose serious ecological and commercial threats.

==Characteristics==

Leporids are small to moderately sized mammals, adapted for rapid movement. They have long hind legs, with four toes on each foot, and shorter fore legs, with five toes each. The soles of their feet are hairy, to improve grip while running, and they have strong claws on all of their toes. Leporids also have distinctive, elongated and mobile ears, and they have an excellent sense of hearing. Their eyes are large, and their night vision is good, reflecting their primarily nocturnal or crepuscular mode of living.

Leporids are all roughly the same shape and fall within a small range of sizes with short tails, ranging in overall length from the long Tres Marias cottontail to the long desert hare. Female leporids are almost always larger than males, which is unusual among terrestrial mammals. It has been noted that the humerus bones of all leporids are extremely similar.

Both rabbits and hares are almost exclusively herbivorous (although some &quot;Lepus&quot; species are known to eat carrion),
feeding primarily on grasses and herbs, although they also eat leaves, fruit, and seeds of various kinds. Easily digestible food is processed in the gastrointestinal tract and expelled as regular feces. But in order to get nutrients out of hard to digest fiber, leporids ferment fiber in the cecum (in the GI tract) and then expel the contents as cecotropes, which are reingested (cecotrophy). The cecotropes are then absorbed in the small intestine to utilize the nutrients.

The dental formula of leporids is: = 28. Many leporids are classified by the characteristics of their teeth; for instance, the Amami rabbit&#x27;s generic name, &quot;Pentalagus&quot;, is derived from the fact that it is often found without its third upper molar, thus having 5 (&quot;penta&quot;-) total molars.

They have adapted to a remarkable range of habitats, from desert to tundra, forests, mountains, and swampland. Some rabbits dig burrows for shelter, the exact form of which varies between species. Other rabbits do not dig burrows but use forms, usually under a bush. Hares rarely dig shelters of any kind, instead using forms, and their bodies are more suited to fast running than to burrowing.

== Reproduction ==
Leporids are typically polygynandrous, and some have highly developed social systems. Their social hierarchies determine which males mate. Rabbits are induced ovulators (ovulate during mating).

Species nesting below ground tend to have lower predation rates and have larger litters.

The gestation period in leporids varies from around 28 to 50 days, and is generally longer in the hares. This is in part because young hares (called leverets) are born precocial (eyes and ears open, fully furred), while young rabbits (called kits) are born altricial (eyes and ears closed, no fur). Higher latitudes correspond to shorter gestation periods. Leporids can have several litters a year, which can cause their population to expand dramatically in a short time when resources are plentiful. Gestation period and litter size correspond to predation rates as well.

==Evolution==
The oldest known leporid species date from the late Eocene, by which time the family was already present in both North America and Asia. Over the course of their evolution, this group has become increasingly adapted to lives of fast running and leaping. For example, &quot;Palaeolagus&quot;, an extinct rabbit from the Oligocene of North America, had shorter hind legs than modern forms (indicating it ran rather than hopped) though it was in most other respects quite rabbit-like. The last common ancestor of the leporids likely had features not present in the last common ancestor of the lagomorphs, according to a 2022 study of the extant and extinct known lagomorphs—an intercranial joint and a facial tilt, specifically. Two as yet unnamed fossil finds—dated ~ ago (from China) and ~ ago (India)—while primitive, display the characteristic leporid ankle, thus pushing the divergence of Ochotonidae and Leporidae yet further into the past.

The cladogram is from Matthee et al., 2004, based on nuclear and mitochondrial gene analysis.

<text>Paul Sarebresole (May 1875 - October 3, 1911) was an early composer of ragtime music. 

Sarebresole was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. His French ancestors spelled the family name &quot;Sarrebresolles&quot;.

His &quot;Roustabout Rag&quot;, published in 1897 by Gruenewald, was one of the earliest published ragtime pieces. It utilized the &quot;three-over-four&quot; rhythm later popularized by Charles L. Johnson. 

Other noted Sarebresole compositions include &quot;Get Your Habits On&quot; from 1898 (which inspired the more popular sequel, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got my Habits On&quot;), &quot;Fire&#x27;s Out&quot; from 1902, and &quot;Come Clean&quot; in 1905. 

Paul Sarebresole died at 1357 St Anthony Street in New Orleans at the age of 36 and was buried in St. Louis Cemetery Number 3.

<doc id="185990" wikidata="Q375444" url="?curid=185990" title="Felicific calculus">
<text>The felicific calculus is an algorithm formulated by utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) for calculating the degree or amount of pleasure that a specific action is likely to induce. Bentham, an ethical hedonist, believed the moral rightness or wrongness of an action to be a function of the amount of pleasure or pain that it produced. The felicific calculus could in principle, at least, determine the moral status of any considered act. The algorithm is also known as the utility calculus, the hedonistic calculus and the hedonic calculus.

To be included in this calculation are several variables (or vectors), which Bentham called &quot;circumstances&quot;. These are:
# Intensity: How strong is the pleasure?
# Duration: How long will the pleasure last?
# Certainty or uncertainty: How likely or unlikely is it that the pleasure will occur?
# Propinquity or remoteness: How soon will the pleasure occur?
# Fecundity: The probability that the action will be followed by sensations of the same kind.
# : The probability that it will not be followed by sensations of the opposite kind.
# : How many people will be affected?

==Bentham&#x27;s instructions==
To take an exact account of the general tendency of any act, by which the interests of a community are affected, proceed as follows. Begin with any one person of those whose interests seem most immediately to be affected by it: and take an account,
* Of the value of each distinguishable pleasure which appears to be produced by it in the first instance.
* Of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it in the first instance.
* Of the value of each pleasure which appears to be produced by it after the first. This constitutes the fecundity of the first pleasure and the impurity of the first pain.
* Of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it after the first. This constitutes the fecundity of the first pain, and the impurity of the first pleasure.
* Sum up all the values of all the pleasures on the one side, and those of all the pains on the other. The balance, if it be on the side of pleasure, will give the good tendency of the act upon the whole, with respect to the interests of that individual person; if on the side of pain, the bad tendency of it upon the whole.
* Take an account of the number of persons whose interests appear to be concerned; and repeat the above process with respect to each. Sum up the numbers expressive of the degrees of good tendency, which the act has, with respect to each individual, in regard to whom the tendency of it is good upon the whole. Do this again with respect to each individual, in regard to whom the tendency of it is bad upon the whole. Take the balance which if on the side of pleasure, will give the general good tendency of the act, with respect to the total number or community of individuals concerned; if on the side of pain, the general evil tendency, with respect to the same community.

To make his proposal easier to remember, Bentham devised what he called a &quot;mnemonic doggerel&quot; (also referred to as &quot;memoriter verses&quot;), which synthesized &quot;the whole fabric of morals and legislation&quot;:

Intense, long, certain, speedy, fruitful, pure—&lt;br&gt;
Such marks in pleasures and in pains endure.&lt;br&gt;
Such pleasures seek if private be thy end:&lt;br&gt;
If it be public, wide let them extend&lt;br&gt;
Such pains avoid, whichever be thy view:&lt;br&gt;
If pains must come, let them extend to few. 

==Jevons&#x27; economics==
W. Stanley Jevons used the algebra of pleasure and pain in his science of utility applied to economics. He described utility with graphs where marginal utility continuously declines. His figure 9 on page 173 has two curves: one for the painfulness of labour and the other for utility of production. As the amount of product increases there is a point where a &quot;balance of pain&quot; is reached and labour ceases.

== Hedonimetry ==

Hedonimetry is the study of happiness (&quot;experienced utility&quot;) as a measurable economic asset. The first major work in the field was an 1881 publication of &quot;Mathematical Psychics&quot; by the famous statistician and economist Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, who hypothesized a way of measuring happiness in units.

The concept of measuring hedonic utility arose in Utilitarianism, with Classical Utilitarians acknowledging that the actual pleasure might not be easy to express quantitatively as a numeric value. Bentham, the early proponent of the concept, declared that the happiness is a sequence of &quot;episodes&quot;, each characterized by its intensity and duration. This definition formally makes episodes permutable, as the total pleasure does not depend on their order. Since practical experience teaches otherwise (enjoyment form a meal does depend on the of courses), followers of Bentham argued that the order of episodes changes their intensity.

===Units===
The units of measurements used in the felicific calculus may be termed &quot;hedons&quot; and &quot;dolors&quot;.

<text>In sociology and in economics, the term conspicuous consumption describes and explains the consumer practice of buying and using goods of a higher quality, price, or in greater quantity than practical. In 1899, the sociologist Thorstein Veblen coined the term &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; to explain the spending of money on and the acquiring of luxury commodities (goods and services) specifically as a public display of economic power—the income and the accumulated wealth—of the buyer. To the conspicuous consumer, the public display of discretionary income is an economic means of either attaining or maintaining a given social status.

The development of Veblen&#x27;s sociology of conspicuous consumption also identified and described other economic behaviours such as invidious consumption, which is the ostentatious consumption of goods, an action meant to provoke the envy of other people; and conspicuous compassion, the ostentatious use of charity meant to enhance the reputation and social prestige of the donor; thus the socio-economic practices of consumerism derive from conspicuous consumption.

==History and development==
In &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions&quot; (1899), Thorstein Veblen identified, described, and explained the behavioural characteristics of the &quot;nouveau riche&quot; (new rich) social class that emerged from capital accumulation during the Second Industrial Revolution (1860–1914). In that 19th-century social and historical context, the term &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; applied narrowly in association with the men, women, and families of the upper class who applied their great wealth as a means of publicly manifesting their social power and prestige, either real or perceived. The strength of one&#x27;s reputation is in direct relationship to the amount of money possessed and displayed; that is to say, the basis &quot;of gaining and retaining a good name, are leisure and conspicuous consumption.&quot;

In the 1920s, economists such as Paul Nystrom proposed that changes in lifestyle as result of the industrial age led to massive expansion of the &quot;pecuniary emulation.&quot; That conspicuous consumption had induced in the mass of society a &quot;philosophy of futility&quot; that would increase the consumption of goods and services as a social fashion; consumption for the sake of consumption.

In 1949, James Duesenberry proposed the &quot;demonstration effect&quot; and the &quot;bandwagon effect&quot;, whereby a person&#x27;s conspicuous consumption psychologically depends upon the actual level of spending, but also depends upon the degree of his or her spending, when compared with and to the spending of other people. That the conspicuous consumer is motivated by the importance, to him or to her, of the opinion of the social and economic reference groups for whom he or she are performed the conspicuous consumption.

===Social class and consumption===
Veblen said that conspicuous consumption comprised socio-economic behaviours practised by rich people as activities usual and exclusive to people with much disposable income; yet a variation of Veblen&#x27;s theory is presented in the conspicuous consumption behaviours that are very common to the middle class and to the working class, regardless of the person&#x27;s race and ethnic group. Such upper-class economic behaviour is especially common in societies with emerging economies in which the conspicuous consumption of goods and services ostentatiously signals that the buyer rose from poverty and has something to prove to society.

In &quot;The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America&#x27;s Wealthy&quot; (1996), Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko reported &quot;conspicuous frugality&quot;, another variation of Veblen&#x27;s social-class relation to conspicuous consumption. That Americans with a net worth of more than a million dollars usually avoid conspicuous consumption, and tend to practise frugality, such as paying cash for a used car rather using credit, in order to avoid material depreciation and paying interest upon a car loan.

==Consumerism theory==
Since the 19th century, conspicuous consumption explains the psychology behind the economics of a consumer society, and the increase in the types of goods and services that people consider necessary to and for their lives in a developed economy. Supporting interpretations and explanations of contemporary conspicuous consumption are presented in &quot;Consumer Culture&quot; (1996) by Celia Lury, &quot;Consumer Culture and Modernity&quot; (1997) by Don Slater, &quot;Symbolic Exchange and Death&quot; (1998) by Jean Baudrillard, and &quot;Spent: Sex, Evolution, and the Secrets of Consumerism&quot; (2009) by Geoffrey Miller.

Moreover, D. Hebdige, in &quot;Hiding in the Light&quot; (1994), proposes that conspicuous consumption is a form of displaying a personal identity, and a consequent function of advertising, as proposed in &quot;Ads, Fads, and Consumer Culture&quot; (2000), by A. A. Berger. Each variant interpretation and complementary explanation is derived from Veblen&#x27;s original sociologic proposition in &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot;: that conspicuous consumption is a psychological end in itself, from which the practitioner (man, woman, family) derived the honour of superior social status.

== Materialism and gender ==
In &quot;An Examination of Materialism, Conspicuous Consumption and Gender Differences&quot; (2013), the researchers Brenda Segal and Jeffrey S. Podoshen reported great differences in the consumerism practised by men and women. The data about materialism and impulse purchases of 1,180 Americans indicate that men have greater scores for materialism and conspicuous consumption; and that women tended to buy goods and services on impulse; and both sexes were equally loyal to a given brand of goods and services.

==Distinctions of type==
The term &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; denotes the act of buying something, especially something expensive, that is not necessary to one&#x27;s life, in a noticeable way. Scholar Andrew Trigg (2001) defined &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; as behaviour by which one can display great wealth, by means of idleness—expending much time in the practice of leisure activities, and spending much money to consume luxury goods and services.

Conspicuous compassion, the practice of publicly donating large sums of money to charity to enhance the social prestige of the donor, is sometimes described as a type of conspicuous consumption. This behaviour has long been recognised and sometimes attacked—for example, the New Testament story &quot;Lesson of the widow&#x27;s mite&quot; criticises wealthy people who make large donations ostentatiously, while praising poorer people who make small but comparatively more difficult donations in private.

Possible motivations for conspicuous consumption include:
* Demonstration/bandwagon effect — In the book &quot;Income, Saving and the Theory of Consumer Behavior&quot; (1949), James Duesenberry proposed that a person&#x27;s conspicuous consumption psychologically depends not only upon the actual level of spending, but also upon the degree of his or her spending, as compared with the spending of other people. Thus the conspicuous consumer is motivated by the importance, to him or to her, of the opinion of the social and economic reference groups for whom are performed the patterns of conspicuous consumption.
* Aggressive ostentation — In a 2006 &quot;CBSNews.com&quot; article, Dick Meyer said that conspicuous consumption is a form of anger towards society, an &quot;aggressive ostentation&quot; that is an antisocial behaviour, which arose from the social alienation suffered by men, women, and families who feel they have become anonymous in and to their societies. This feeling of alienation is aggravated by the decay of the communitarian ethic essential to a person feeling him or herself part of the whole society.
* Shelter and transport — In the United States, the trend towards building houses that were larger than needed by a nuclear family began in the 1950s. Decades later, in the year 2000, that practice of conspicuous consumption resulted in people buying houses that were double the average size needed to comfortably house a nuclear family. Negative consequences of either buying or building an oversized house might include:
**the loss of or reduction in the family&#x27;s domestic recreational space—the backyard and the front yard;
**the spending of old-age retirement funds to pay for a too-big house;
**over-long commuting time, from house to job, and vice versa, because the required plot of land was unavailable near a city.

Oversized houses facilitated other forms of conspicuous consumption, such as an oversized garage for the family&#x27;s oversized motor vehicles or buying more clothing to fill larger clothes closets. Conspicuous consumption becomes a self-generating cycle of spending money for the sake of social prestige. Analogous to the consumer trend for oversized houses is the trend towards buying oversized light trucks, specifically the off-road sport utility vehicle type (cf. station wagon/estate car), as a form of psychologically comforting conspicuous consumption, because such large vehicles usually are bought by city-dwellers, an urban nuclear family.

* Prestige – In a 1999 article, Jacqueline Eastman, Ronald Goldsmith, and Leisa Reinecke Flynn said that &quot;status consumption&quot; is based upon conspicuous consumption; however, the literature of contemporary marketing does not establish definitive meanings for the terms &quot;status consumption&quot; and &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot;. Moreover, A. O&#x27;Cass and H. Frost (2002) claim that sociologists often incorrectly used the two terms as interchangeable and equivalent terms. In a later study, O&#x27;Cass and Frost determined that, as sociological constructs, the terms &quot;status consumption&quot; and &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; denote different sociological behaviours. About the ambiguities of denotation and connotation of the term &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot;, R. Mason (1984) reported that the classical, general theories of consumer decision-processes do not readily accommodate the construct of &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot;, because the nature of said socio-economic behaviours varies according to the social class and the economic group studied.
* Motivations – Paurav Shukla (2010) says that, whilst marketing and sales researchers recognise the importance of the buyer&#x27;s social and psychological environment, the definition of the term &quot;status-directed consumption&quot; remains ambiguous, because the development of a comprehensive general theory requires that social scientists accept two fundamental assumptions, which usually do not concord. First, though the &quot;rational&quot; (economic) and the &quot;irrational&quot; (psychologic) elements of consumer decision-making often influence a person&#x27;s decision to buy particular goods and services, marketing and sales researchers usually consider the rational element dominant in a person&#x27;s decision to buy the particular goods and services. Second, the consumer perceives the utility of the product (the goods, the services) as a prime consideration in evaluating its usefulness, i.e. the &quot;reason&quot; to buy the product. These assumptions, required for the development of a general theory of brand selection and brand purchase, are problematic, because the resultant theories tend either to misunderstand or to ignore the &quot;irrational&quot; element in the behaviour of the buyer-as-consumer; and because conspicuous consumption is a behaviour predominantly &quot;psychological&quot; in motivation and expression, Therefore, a comprehensive, general theory of conspicuous consumption would require a separate construct for the psychological (irrational) elements of the socio-economic phenomenon that is conspicuous consumption.

== Examples ==
Conspicuous consumption is exemplified by purchasing goods that are exclusively designed to serve as symbols of wealth, such as luxury-brand clothing, high-tech tools, and vehicles.

=== Luxury fashion ===
Materialistic consumers are likely to engage in conspicuous luxury consumption. The global yearly revenue of the luxury fashion industry was €1.64 trillion in 2019. Buying of conspicuous goods is likely to be influenced by the spending habits of others. This view of luxury conspicuous consumption is being incorporated into social media platforms which is impacting consumer behaviour. During periods of economic downturn, consumers tend to turn away from &quot;logomania&quot; products and instead purchase luxury goods that signal affluence more subtly.

==Criticism==
In 1919, the journalist H. L. Mencken addressed the sociological and psychological particulars of the socio-economic behaviours that are conspicuous consumption, by asking:Do I enjoy a decent bath because I know that John Smith cannot afford one—or because I delight in being clean? Do I admire Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony because it is incomprehensible to Congressmen and Methodists—or because I genuinely love music? Do I prefer terrapin à la Maryland to fried liver because plowhands must put up with the liver—or because the terrapin is intrinsically a more charming dose? Do I prefer kissing a pretty girl to kissing a charwoman, because even a janitor may kiss a charwoman—or because the pretty girl looks better, smells better, and kisses better?

=== Inequality and debt ===

In &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899) Veblen said that &quot;among the motives which lead men to accumulate wealth, the primacy, both in scope and intensity, therefore, continues to belong to this motive of pecuniary emulation of the rich&quot;. In the study &quot;Borrowing to Keep Up (with the Joneses): Inequality, Debt, and Conspicuous Consumption&quot; (2020), Sheheryar Banuri and Ha Nguyen reported three findings:

* Consumption tends to increase when the buying and the using of goods and services is conspicuous: Consumption signals status to other people.
* Conspicuous consumption increases the frequency of borrowing money: Poor people take out loans in order to compete at consumption.
* Economic inequality is worsened with access to credit: Poor people borrow money in order to signal status, which becomes a vicious circle.

The findings that Banuri and Nguyen reported indicate that the cyclical effect of borrowing money for conspicuous consumption leads to and perpetuates economic inequality. That poor people imitate, try to match, and emulate the consumption patterns of rich people in order to increase their social status, and perhaps rise in society. That such socio-economic behaviours, facilitated by easy access to credit, generate macroeconomic volatility and support Veblen&#x27;s concept of pecuniary emulation used to finance a person&#x27;s social standing.

Other research supports these and similar results. For example income inequality has been found to be associated with reduced savings rates. One hypothesized mechanism for this relationship is &#x27;expenditure cascades&#x27; whereby consumption norms are set by the relatively wealthy, who then have more income and consumption relative to others as inequality rises. This emulation of the consumption norms of relatively wealthy peers is supported by a large literature. 

One complication found in the macro literature is that the link between inequality and savings may depend on context, in particular on the degree of financialisation. When the degree of financialisation is high, inequality tends to reduce the national savings rate as the emulation effect is more powerful when finance is readily available, but the opposite effect may occur when financialisation is low as the emulation effect is weak, and the rich tend to save at a higher rate than the poor. The effect of inequality on savings is also found to be positive in Asia, where financialization is lower. The relationship is also found to depend on economic policy and institutions. For example inequality appears to lower savings in &#x27;liberal market economies&#x27; but to rather reduce aggregate demand in &#x27;coordinated market economies&#x27;. 

In the case where inequality lowers savings, and increases leverage and a tendency to run large current account imbalances via the expenditure cascade mechanism, this has been associated with more frequent and/or severe economic crisis.

== Solutions ==
In the case of conspicuous consumption, taxes upon luxury goods diminish societal expenditures on high-status goods, by rendering them more expensive than non-positional goods. In this sense, luxury taxes can be seen as a market failure correcting Pigouvian tax—with an apparent negative deadweight loss, these taxes are a more efficient mechanism for increasing revenue than &#x27;distorting&#x27; labour or capital taxes. A luxury tax applied to goods and services for conspicuous consumption is a type of progressive sales tax that at least partially corrects the negative externality associated with the conspicuous consumption of positional goods. In &quot;Utility from Accumulation&quot; (2009), Louis Kaplow said that assets exercise an objective social-utility function, i.e. the rich man and the rich woman hoard material assets, because the hoard, itself, functions as status goods that establish his and her socio-economic position within society. When utility is derived directly from accumulation of assets, this lowers the dead weight loss associated with inheritance taxes and raises the optimal rate of inheritance taxation.

In place of luxury taxes, economist Robert H. Frank proposed the application of a progressive consumption tax; in a 1998 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, John Tierney said that as a remedy for the social and psychological malaise that is conspicuous consumption, the personal income tax should be replaced with a progressive tax upon the yearly sum of discretionary income spent on the conspicuous consumption of goods and services. Another option is the redistribution of wealth, either by means of an incomes policy – for example the conscious efforts to promote wage compression under variants of social corporatism such as the Rehn–Meidner model and/or by some mix of progressive taxation and transfer policies, and provision of public goods. When individuals are concerned with their relative income or consumption in comparison to their peers, the optimal degree of public good provision and of progression of the tax system is raised. Because the activity of conspicuous consumption, itself, is a form of superior good, diminishing the income inequality of the income distribution by way of an egalitarian policy reduces the conspicuous consumption of positional goods and services. In &quot;Wealth and Welfare&quot; (1912), the economist A. C. Pigou said that the redistribution of wealth might lead to great gains in social welfare:

The economic case for the taxation of positional, luxury goods has a long history; in the mid-19th century, in &quot;Principles of Political Economy with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy&quot; (1848), John Stuart Mill said:

In the case where conspicuous consumption mediates a link between inequality and unsustainable borrowing, one suggested policy response is tighter financial regulation. 

&quot;Conspicuous non-consumption&quot; is a phrase used to describe a conscious choice to opt out of consumption with the intention of sending deliberate social signals.

<doc id="185996" wikidata="Q725440" url="?curid=185996" title="Prelate">
<text>A prelate () is a high-ranking member of the Christian clergy who is an ordinary or who ranks in precedence with ordinaries. The word derives from the Latin , the past participle of , which means &#x27;carry before&#x27;, &#x27;be set above or over&#x27; or &#x27;prefer&#x27;; hence, a prelate is one set over others.

The archetypal prelate is a bishop, whose prelature is his particular church. All other prelates, including the regular prelates such as abbots and major superiors, are based upon this original model of prelacy.

==Related terminology==
In a general sense, a &quot;prelate&quot; in the Catholic Church and other Christian churches is a bishop or other ecclesiastical person who possesses ordinary authority of a jurisdiction, i.e., of a diocese or similar jurisdiction, e.g., ordinariates, apostolic vicariates/exarchates, or territorial abbacies. It equally applies to cardinals, who enjoy a kind of &quot;co-governance&quot; of the church as the most senior ecclesiastical advisers and moral representatives of the Supreme Pontiff, and certain &quot;superior prelates of the offices of the Roman Curia&quot; who are not bishops, e.g., the auditors (judges) of the Roman Rota and protonotaries apostolic. By extension, it refers to &quot;inferior&quot; or &quot;lesser prelates&quot;, that is priests who have the title and dress of prelates as a personal honorific, i.e., Papal chaplains, prelates of honor (formerly &quot;domestic prelates&quot;), and honorary protonotaries apostolic. All these enjoy the title of &quot;monsignor&quot;, which also is used in some nations for bishops and archbishops. The seven &quot;de numero&quot; protonotaries apostolic in Rome, who are special Papal notaries, are true prelates like bishops; others are &quot;supernumerary&quot; protonotaries apostolic who enjoy this as an honorific, like Papal chaplains and prelates of honor. 

In the strict canonical sense, &quot;prelate&quot; denominates a priest or bishop who is ordinary of a personal prelature (see below), which is a functional equivalent of a diocese that has a &quot;particular pastoral or missionary work for various regions or for different social groups&quot; (cf. &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;, Canon 294) yet no territorial jurisdiction.

In the Armenian Apostolic Church, &quot;prelate&quot; (in English) denominates a diocesan bishop, whose jurisdiction of his diocese is denominated a &quot;prelacy&quot;.

==Territorial prelatures==
In the Catholic Church, a territorial prelate is a prelate whose geographic jurisdiction, denominated a &quot;territorial prelature&quot;, is outside of and therefore not subject to any diocese. A territorial prelate is sometimes denominated a &quot;prelate nullius&quot;, from the Latin &quot;nullius diœceseos&quot; (prelate of no diocese), denoting that his territory is directly subject to the Holy See (the Supreme Pontiff) and is not a diocese. , there were 44 territorial prelatures, all of which were in the Latin Church.

The term also is used generically, in which case it may equally refer to an apostolic prefecture, an apostolic vicariate, or a territorial abbacy.

==Personal prelatures==
In the Catholic Church, the personal prelature was conceived during the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) in no. 10 of the decree &quot;Presbyterorum ordinis&quot; and Pope Paul VI later enacted it into law in the &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Ecclesiae sanctae&quot;. The institution was later reaffirmed in the &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; of 1983. Such a prelature is an institution having clergy and, possibly, lay members which would execute specific pastoral activities. The adjective &quot;personal&quot; refers to the fact that in contrast with previous canonical use for ecclesiastical institutions, the jurisdiction of the prelate is not territorial and instead is of specific persons wherever they are located. The establishment of personal prelatures is an exercise of the theologically inherent power of self-organization which the Church has to pursue its mission, though a personal prelature is not a particular church, as are dioceses and military ordinariates.

Personal prelatures are fundamentally secular organizations operating &quot;in&quot; the world (members do not take vows and live normal lives), whereas religious institutes are religious organizations operating &quot;out&quot; of the world (members take vows and live by the proper law of their institute).

The first, and presently only, personal prelature is Opus Dei, which Pope John Paul II erected as such in 1982 by the Apostolic constitution &quot;Ut sit&quot;. In the case of Opus Dei, the Prelate is elected by members of the Prelature and confirmed by the Supreme Pontiff; the laity and clergy of the Prelature remain subject to the government of the particular churches in whose territory they live, and the laity associated with the Prelature, both men and women, are organically united under the jurisdiction of the Prelate.

==Guidelines==
On 15 February 2018, a &quot;motu proprio&quot; issued by Pope Francis ordered prelates and bishops to live simply and renounce any desire for power after they retired from senior offices of the Roman Curia. Several such officials and bishops had been criticized in the preceding years for luxurious living, such as having large apartments and police escorts after they retired. One notable incident involved Tarcisio Bertone, an Italian prelate and former Cardinal Secretary of State removed from office in 2013, who used an apartment that had been renovated at the cost of nearly half a million dollars in funds, which were diverted from a Vatican-owned hospital by the former president of the hospital. Even after he retired, Tarcisio Bertone used escorts of Vatican City and Italian police to move around Rome.

<doc id="186012" wikidata="Q1568313" url="?curid=186012" title="Baháʼí House of Worship">
<text>A Baháʼí House of Worship or Baháʼí temple is a place of worship of the Baháʼí Faith. It is also referred to by the name Mashriqu&#x27;l-Adhkár, which is Arabic for &quot;Dawning-place of the remembrance of God&quot;.

All Baháʼí Houses of Worship have a round, nine-sided shape and are surrounded by nine pathways leading outwards and nine gardens, reflecting the number nine&#x27;s symbolic significance for Baháʼís. Inside, there is a prayer hall with seats facing in the direction of the Shrine of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh. The Houses of Worship are open throughout the week to both Baháʼís and non-Baháʼís for prayer and reflection, and some also have scheduled weekly devotional services. Scriptural texts from all religions may be recited inside, but sermons, ritualistic ceremonies, and readings from non-scriptural texts are not allowed. In addition, several Houses of Worship have formed choirs that sing music based on the Baháʼí writings, though musical instruments may not be played inside. At present, most Baháʼí devotional meetings occur in individuals&#x27; homes or local Baháʼí centres rather than in Houses of Worship.

The first Baháʼí House of Worship was planned during the lifetime of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh (1817–1892) and completed in 1919, though it was later destroyed. Next, eight Houses of Worship designated as continental Houses of Worship were completed between 1953 and 2016. They are located in the United States, Uganda, Australia, Germany, Panama, Samoa, India, and Chile, and some have won architectural awards. All other Baháʼí Houses of Worship are designated as either local or national Houses of Worship. The Universal House of Justice announced seven more in 2012, all but one of which have been completed, and announced another six in 2023 and 2024. The Baháʼí Faith envisions that Houses of Worship will be surrounded by dependencies dedicated to social, humanitarian, educational, and scientific pursuits, although none has yet been built up to that extent.

==History==

The Baháʼí House of Worship was first mentioned under the name &quot;Mashriqu&#x27;l-Adhkár&quot; (; Arabic for &quot;Dawning-place of the remembrance of God&quot;) in the &quot;Kitáb-i-Aqdas&quot;, the book of laws of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, founder of the Baháʼí Faith. Baháʼu&#x27;lláh wrote:
O people of the world! Build ye houses of worship throughout the lands in the name of Him Who is the Lord of all religions. Make them as perfect as is possible in the world of being, and adorn them with that which befitteth them, not with images and effigies. Then, with radiance and joy, celebrate therein the praise of your Lord, the Most Compassionate.

The first Baháʼí House of Worship, in what is now Turkmenistan, was planned during the lifetime of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh and then designed and constructed during the ministry of his son and successor, ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá. It was completed in 1919 but later expropriated from the Baháʼís and eventually demolished. The cornerstone of the first Baháʼí House of Worship that is still standing, in the United States, was laid in 1912 by ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, and the House of Worship was dedicated in 1953 during the ministry of his grandson and successor, Shoghi Effendi.

Also in 1953, Shoghi Effendi announced a long-term plan to build a temple for each (roughly) continental region. These temples are referred to as &quot;Mother temples&quot; or continental temples and are intended as the first of many temples in their regions. Shoghi Effendi died in 1957, but his plans for the construction of Baháʼí Houses of Worship were continued by the Universal House of Justice, a body first elected in 1963 that has led the world Baháʼí community since that time. The Universal House of Justice has included constructing Houses of Worship in the goals of some of its teaching plans. By the end of the twentieth century, further continental Houses of Worship were completed in Uganda, Australia, Germany, Panama, Samoa, and India. In 2001, the Universal House of Justice wrote in its Ridván Message to the Baháʼís of the world that &quot;with profound thankfulness and joy... we announce at this auspicious moment the decision to proceed&quot; with the construction in Chile of the eighth and final continental House of Worship. It was completed in 2016.

Meanwhile, in the Ridván message of 2012, the Universal House of Justice announced the locations of the first local and national Baháʼí Houses of Worship that would be built. The first two national Houses of Worship would be in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Papua New Guinea, while the first five local Houses of Worship would be in Cambodia, India, Kenya, Colombia, and Vanuatu. Since the announcement, the two national Houses of Worship and four of the local Houses of Worship have been completed, and there has been a groundbreaking ceremony for the fifth local House of Worship. In addition, more than 120 national Baháʼí communities have now acquired properties for the eventual construction of Baháʼí Houses of Worship, compared to 84 national communities that had done so by 1988.

==Architecture==

All Baháʼí Houses of Worship share certain architectural elements, some of which are specified by Baháʼí scripture. They are required to have a round, nine-sided shape and to have nine pathways lead outward and nine gardens surrounding them. The number nine is symbolically significant for Baháʼís, representing completeness, perfection, and the Baháʼí teaching of the unity of religion. As of 2010 all standing Baháʼí Houses of Worship have a dome, although the Baháʼí laws do not require Houses of Worship to have domes. The Greatest Name, a Baháʼí symbol, appears in calligraphy in each temple, often at the top of the dome. All Baháʼí Houses of Worship also have a prayer hall, with seats facing towards the Shrine of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh in present-day Acre, Israel, which is the Qiblih, the direction Baháʼís face in their obligatory prayers. No pulpits or altars may be incorporated as architectural features.

While they share some essential architectural elements, Baháʼí Houses of Worship differ in other aspects of their designs. Design proposals may be submitted by Baháʼí and non-Baháʼí architects, and some completed Houses of Worship were designed by non-Baháʼís. The Baháʼí Houses of Worship designed while Shoghi Effendi led the Baháʼí community include many classical architectural elements and generally avoid modern styles, which he described as &quot;for the most part ugly, and altogether too utilitarian in aspect for a House of Worship&quot;. To varying degrees, Baháʼí Houses of Worship also integrate cultural and environmental elements from the areas in which they are built into their materials, landscaping, and architecture. These local symbols are generally more prominent in the more recent Houses of Worship.

==Purpose and activities==
A Baháʼí House of Worship is a place of worship of the Baháʼí Faith, where both Baháʼís and non-Baháʼís can express devotion to God. Baháʼí Houses of Worship are open to all regardless of religion, gender, or any other distinction. The only requirements for entry are modest dress and quiet behavior. The Baháʼí laws state that a House of Worship should be built in each city and town. Shoghi Effendi said that a Baháʼí temple is a &quot;silent teacher&quot; of the Baháʼí Faith.

The Baháʼí laws require that only scriptural texts—of the Baháʼí Faith or other religions—may be read or chanted inside, though in any language. Since there are no pulpits, readers may use a simple portable lectern. While readings and prayers that have been set to music may be sung by choirs, no musical instruments may be played inside. Several Baháʼí Houses of Worship have established choirs that sing music based on the Baháʼí writings (scriptures). Baháʼí scripture also states that no pictures, statues, or images may be displayed within Houses of Worship. No sermons may be delivered, and no ritualistic ceremonies may be practiced. Memorial services are sometimes held in Bahá&#x27;í Houses of Worship, and while wedding ceremonies are not permitted inside, they are often held in the gardens of the temples. In mainly Christian countries, Baháʼí Houses of Worship offer weekly devotional services on Sundays, with the Baháʼí calendar not yet implemented for temple worship.

Shoghi Effendi taught that Houses of Worship should each be surrounded by a complex of humanitarian, educational, and charitable institutions—such as schools, hospitals, homes for the elderly, universities, and hostels—to serve the areas in which they are situated. He said the future interaction between the House of Worship and its dependencies could provide &quot;the essentials of Baháʼí worship and service, both so vital to the regeneration of the world&quot;. To date, only a few such dependencies have been built and no Baháʼí House of Worship has had the full range of dependencies that are envisioned. Shoghi Effendi also viewed the functions of the House of Worship as complementary to those of the Haziratu&#x27;l-Quds (commonly known as a Baháʼí centre), and said that it would be desirable if both these buildings were on the same site. At present, Baháʼí devotional meetings in most communities take place in homes or Baháʼí centres, but Elham Afnan notes that such activities &quot;evoke the spirit&quot; of a House of Worship with the goal that it can eventually be constructed.

==Funding and administration==
Baháʼí Houses of Worship are funded by the voluntary contributions of Baháʼí communities. There are no collections during temple services and only Baháʼís are permitted to contribute to the Baháʼí funds, including funds for the construction and maintenance of Houses of Worship. ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi both viewed the construction of Baháʼí Houses of Worship in individual countries as projects of the international Baháʼí community. When Houses of Worship are built, the required funds accordingly come from Baháʼís around the world. Worldwide, expenses associated with Houses of Worship (and with the buildings at the Baháʼí World Centre) constitute a significant part of the spending of the Baháʼí administration.

In general, a Baháʼí House of Worship and the grounds on which it is situated are the property of the Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly of that country, and the properties are held in a financial endowment. A committee of the National Spiritual Assembly of the relevant country administers the House of Worship&#x27;s activities and affairs, but spiritually they see themselves as custodians of a temple that belongs to all the world&#x27;s Baháʼís.

==Continental Houses of Worship==
===Wilmette, U.S.===

The oldest extant Baháʼí House of Worship stands in Wilmette, on the shore of Lake Michigan near Chicago. It has received architectural awards. In 1978, it was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places. In 2007, the Baháʼí House of Worship was named one of the Seven Wonders of Illinois by the Illinois Bureau of Tourism. The temple is visited by about 250,000 people every year.

During his journeys to the West, ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá came to Wilmette for the groundbreaking ceremony of the temple and laid the foundation stone on 1 May 1912. The principal architect was Louis Bourgeois, though his original design ended up being amended numerous times due to impractical elements. Construction began in 1921 and was completed in 1951, and the temple was dedicated in 1953. The total cost of the construction was above $2.6 million. From 1958–2001, the Wilmette House of Worship was associated with a &quot;home for the aged&quot;, operated by the U.S. Baháʼí community.

The cladding of the building is composed of a concrete mixture of Portland cement, quartz, and sand, developed for the temple by John Joseph Earley. From ground level, the building stands approximately 58.2 metres tall and the diameter of the dome is 27.4 metres. The auditorium seats 1,191 visitors. The exterior is adorned with symbols from various religions, including the Latin Cross, the Greek Cross, the star and crescent, the Star of David, the swastika (which is an ancient symbol used in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism), and the five-pointed star. The grounds of the temple feature nine fountains, rows of Chinese junipers, and a wide range of flowers including thousands of tulips planted each fall.

===Kampala, Uganda===
There is a Baháʼí House of Worship situated on the northern outskirts of Kampala, Uganda&#x27;s capital and largest city, on Kikaaya Hill. Shoghi Effendi announced that the Kampala temple would be built in 1955 after persecution of Baháʼís in Iran made it impossible for them to build one. It was designed by architect Charles Mason Remey. The foundation stone was laid on 26 January 1957 by Rúhíyyih Khánum, representing Shoghi Effendi. Musa Banani, the first Hand of the Cause in Africa, was also present for the groundbreaking and placed a gift of soil from the Shrine of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, sent by Shoghi Effendi, in the foundation. The dedication ceremony was held in January 1961 and was also attended by Rúhíyyih Khánum.

The building is more than 39 metres high, and over 100 metres in diameter at the base. The dome is over 37 metres high and 13 metres in diameter. As a protection against earthquakes that can occur in the region, the temple has a foundation that goes 3 metres beneath the ground. The temple has seating for 800 people. At the time it was built, the Kampala Baháʼí temple was the tallest building in East Africa.

The temple&#x27;s dome is built out of fixed mosaic tiles from Italy, whereas the tiles of the lower roof are from Belgium. The wall panels contain windows of green, pale blue, and amber colored glass of German origin. Both the timber used for making the doors and benches and the stone used for the walls of the temple are from within Uganda itself. The property includes the House of Worship, extensive gardens, a guest house, and an administrative centre.

===Sydney, Australia===
The fourth Baháʼí temple to be completed (and third still standing) is in Ingleside in the northern suburbs of Sydney, Australia. This temple serves as the &quot;Mother Temple of the Antipodes&quot;. According to Jennifer Taylor, a historian at Sydney University, it is among Sydney&#x27;s four most significant religious buildings constructed in the twentieth century. The initial design by Charles Mason Remey was given to Sydney architect John Brogan to develop and complete. It was dedicated in September 1961 and opened to the public after four years of construction.

Construction materials include crushed quartz concrete, local hardwoods in the interior, and concrete and marble in the dome. There is seating for 600 people. The building stands 38 metres in height, has a diameter at its widest point of 20 metres, and is a highly visible landmark from Sydney&#x27;s northern beaches. The property is set high in a natural bushland setting overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The surrounding gardens contain a variety of native Australian flora including waratahs, three species of eucalypts, caleyi and other grevillea, acacia, and woody pear.

===Langenhain, Germany===
There is a Baháʼí House of Worship at the foot of the Taunus Mountains of Germany, in the village of Langenhain near Frankfurt. It was designed by German architect Teuto Rocholl. The foundation stone for the temple was laid on 20 November 1960 by Amelia Collins and the temple was dedicated on 4 July 1964. Its construction was opposed by a number of Catholic and Protestant churches in Germany at the time. The temple&#x27;s superstructure was prefabricated in the Netherlands out of steel and concrete. The center of the interior of the temple is illuminated by light shining through over 500 glass panels above. At its base, the interior is 48 metres in diameter. The height from ground level is 28.3 metres and the temple can seat up to 600 people. Seena Fazel describes the House of Worship as having a &quot;distinctive concrete and glass modernist design&quot;.

===Panama City, Panama===

There is a Baháʼí temple in Panama City, Panama, which was designed by English architect Peter Tillotson. Rúhíyyih Khánum laid the foundation stone on 8 October 1967 and temple was dedicated on 29 April 1972. It is perched on a mountain named Cerro Sonsonate, 10 km northeast of Panama City such that it can be seen from many parts of the city. The temple is built from local stone, which is laid in designs evoking Native American fabric designs and temples of the ancient Americas. The dome is covered with thousands of small oval tiles and rises to a height of 28 metres. The temple has seats made from mahogany for up to 550 people and a floor made from terrazzo.

===Tiapapata, Samoa===

There is a Baháʼí House of Worship set in Tiapapata, in the hills behind Apia, Samoa. It was designed by Hossein Amanat. Both Malietoa Tanumafili II of Samoa, the world&#x27;s first Baháʼí head of state, and Rúhíyyih Khánum helped lay the foundation stone on 27 January 1979 and attended the dedication on 1 September 1984. The temple was completed at a total cost of $6.5 million. It has a 30-metre-tall domed structure and seats up to 500 people in the main hall plus 200 on the mezzanine level. The structure is open to the island breezes; Graham Hassall writes that this fosters a suitable environment for meditation and prayer.

===New Delhi, India===

In Bahapur, New Delhi, India, there is a Baháʼí House of Worship that is commonly known as the Lotus Temple, which was designed by Iranian-American architect Fariborz Sahba. Rúhíyyih Khánum laid the foundation stone on 17 October 1977 and dedicated the temple on 24 December 1986. The total cost was $10 million. The temple has won numerous architectural awards, including from the Institution of Structural Engineers, the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, and the Architectural Society of China. It has also become a major attraction for people of various religions, with up to 100,000 visitors on some Hindu holy days; estimates for the number of visitors per year range from 2.5 million to 5 million. The temple is often listed as one of Delhi&#x27;s main tourist attractions, and even as one of the most visited buildings in the world.

Inspired by the sacred lotus flower, the temple&#x27;s design is composed of 27 free-standing, marble-clad &quot;petals&quot; grouped into clusters of three and thus forming nine entryways. The temple&#x27;s shape has symbolic and inter-religious significance because the lotus is often associated with the Hindu goddess Lakshmi. Nine doors open onto a central hall with permanent seating for 1,200 people, which can be expanded for a total seating capacity of 2,500 people. The temple rises to a height of 40.8 metres and is situated on a property that covers 105,000 square metres and features nine surrounding ponds. An educational centre beside the temple was established in 2017. The temple uses solar panels to produce 120 kW of the 500 kW of electricity it requires in total.

===Santiago, Chile===

The continental Baháʼí House of Worship for South America (or &quot;Mother Temple for South America&quot;) is located in Santiago, Chile. Shoghi Effendi announced Chile as the site for the continental temple of South America in 1953, and in 2001 the process to build the temple was launched. The chosen design was by Siamak Hariri of Hariri Pontarini Architects in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Excavation was initiated at the site in 2010 and construction began in 2012. The doors opened on 19 October 2016. The Santiago temple cost a total of $30 million to build and has won a range of Canadian and international architectural awards.

The Santiago Baháʼí House of Worship is ringed by nine entrances, nine pathways, and nine fountains, and the structure is composed of nine arching &quot;sails&quot;. These have also been described as nine &quot;petals&quot; and the temple&#x27;s shape as &quot;floral&quot;; the &quot;petals&quot; are separated by glass which allows light to illuminate the temple&#x27;s interior. The exterior of the &quot;petals&quot; is made from cast glass while the interior is made from translucent Portuguese marble. The sides of the temple are held up on the inside by a steel and aluminum superstructure. The temple can seat 600 people and it is 30 metres high and 30 metres in diameter.

==Other Houses of Worship==
===Completed but destroyed===

The first Baháʼí House of Worship was built in the city of Ashgabat, which was then a part of Russia&#x27;s Transcaspian Oblast and is now the capital of Turkmenistan. It was started in 1902 and mostly completed by 1907, but was not fully finished until 1919. Plans for this House of Worship were first made during the lifetime of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh. The design was prepared by Ustad Ali-Akbar Banna, and after his death the construction was supervised by Vakílu&#x27;d-Dawlih. In 1928, the House of Worship was expropriated by the Soviet authorities and thereafter it was leased back to the Baháʼís. This arrangement lasted until 1938, when it was fully secularized and turned into an art gallery. The 1948 Ashgabat earthquake seriously damaged the building, rendering it unsafe; the heavy rains of the following years weakened the structure, until in 1963 the building was demolished and the site was converted into a public park.

The Ashgabat House of Worship was surrounded by gardens with nine ponds. At the four corners of the plot of land surrounding the House of Worship were various buildings: a boys&#x27; school; a girls&#x27; school; a large meeting hall; and a group of buildings including the offices of the Local Spiritual Assembly, a reading room, and a room for meeting with enquirers.

===Completed and standing===

The Battambang, Cambodia temple was the world&#x27;s first local Baháʼí House of Worship to be completed. The temple was designed by Cambodian architect Sochet Vitou Tang, who is a practicing Buddhist, and integrates distinctive Cambodian architectural principles. A dedication ceremony and official opening conference took place on 1–2 September 2017, attended by Cambodian dignitaries, locals, and representatives of Baháʼí communities throughout southeast Asia.

The temple in Agua Azul in the municipality of Villa Rica, Cauca Department, Colombia was the second local Baháʼí House of Worship to be completed in the world. The temple design, by architect Julian Gutierrez Chacón, was inspired by the shape of the cocoa seed, which was integral to the local culture before the arrival of the sugar cane industry. An opening dedication ceremony took place on 22 July 2018, followed by devotional services in the House of Worship.

A local Baháʼí House of Worship was opened on 23 May 2021 in Matunda Soy, Kenya.

On 13 November 2021, a local Baháʼí House of Worship opened near the town of Lenakel on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu.

The world&#x27;s first national Baháʼí House of Worship, located in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, was dedicated and opened its doors on 25 March 2023.

A national Baháʼí House of Worship in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea was dedicated on 25 May 2024.

===Planned===

In 2021, groundbreaking ceremony took place for a local Baháʼí House of Worship in Hargawan near Bihar Sharif, India. The design for the temple near Bihar Sharif, created by architect Amritha Ballal, was shortlisted for the 2022 World Architecture Festival.

In April 2023, the Universal House of Justice announced plans for three further Houses of Worship: local Houses of Worship in Nepal and Zambia and a national House of Worship in Canada.

In October 2024, the Universal House of Justice announced plans for another three Houses of Worship: a local House of Worship in Batouri, Cameroon and national Houses of Worship in Brasília, Brazil and Lilongwe, Malawi.

A site was selected and purchased in 1932 for a Baháʼí House of Worship in Hadiqa, northeast of Tehran, Iran. Charles Mason Remey provided a design for this temple which Shoghi Effendi then approved. A drawing of the design was published in an issue of &quot;The Baháʼí World&quot;. To date, however, the construction of this temple has not been possible.

Similarly, a design was created for a Baháʼí House of Worship near Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel. It was created by Charles Mason Remey and approved by Shoghi Effendi in 1952. A photo of the model of the Haifa House of Worship can be found in an issue of &quot;The Baháʼí World&quot;. An obelisk marks the site where the House of Worship is to be built, but as of 2010, plans for constructing this House of Worship have not been made.

==Analysis==
Margit Warburg describes the architecture of the Baháʼí Houses of Worship as &quot;remarkable&quot;. Denis MacEoin writes that several of the Baháʼí Houses of Worship are &quot;fine examples of modern religious architecture&quot;, but argues that no distinct Baháʼí architectural style has emerged given that the best-designed Baháʼí Houses of Worship each have a unique character. Anne Gordon Perry argues, by contrast, that Baháʼí Houses of Worship may provide &quot;the clearest indication of a distinctive Bahá’í aesthetic thus far ... with their characteristic nine sides, circular domes, serene and welcoming gardens and walkways, fountains, and other aesthetic elements&quot;.

Warburg writes that the presence of Baháʼí Houses of Worship on all continents except Antarctica shows the worldwide presence of the Baháʼí Faith. She also argues that there are a number of parallels between Baháʼí Houses of Worship and mosques: decoration with geometric patterns rather than images or statues, the absence of offering or communion rituals, and the adaptation of architectural designs to local cultural styles.

Warburg found in her fieldwork at several Baháʼí temples that almost all attendees of weekly services were Baháʼís but that many non-Baháʼís visited at other times during the week. She has questioned whether having the temples open for visitors but without activities at most times during the week is &quot;the optimal mission strategy&quot; for Baháʼís, noting an account of a visitor confused by one temple&#x27;s apparent lack of purpose. However, Graham Hassall has disputed Warburg&#x27;s analysis, pointing to the large number of tourists visiting many Baháʼí Houses of Worship and positive coverage in online media such as travel guides and blogs.

<doc id="186014" wikidata="Q795330" url="?curid=186014" title="The Sky at Night">
<text>The Sky at Night is a documentary television programme on astronomy produced by the BBC. The show had the same permanent presenter, Sir Patrick Moore, from its first monthly broadcast on 24 April 1957 until 7 January 2013. The latter date was a posthumous broadcast, following Moore&#x27;s death on 9 December 2012. This made it the longest-running programme with the same presenter in television history. Many early episodes are missing, either because the tapes were wiped or discarded, or because the episode was broadcast live and never recorded in the first place.

The programme was shown monthly up until 2023.

Beginning with the 3 February 2013 edition, the show was co-presented by Lucie Green and Chris Lintott. Since December 2013 Maggie Aderin-Pocock has also been a presenter. In April 2023, Dr George Dransfield joined the show as a presenter.

Pete Lawrence has presented an observing section on the programme since 2004 as well as producing an online monthly star Guide on the BBC Sky at Night webpage.

The programme&#x27;s opening and closing theme music is &quot;At the Castle Gate&quot;, from the incidental music to &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, written in 1905 by Jean Sibelius, performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham.

==Content==
The programme covers a wide range of general astronomical and space-related topics. Topics include stellar life cycles, radio astronomy, artificial satellites, black holes, neutron stars and many others. The programme also covers events happening in the night sky at the time of broadcast, such as a bright comet or a meteor shower, and recent developments in space and astronomy, such as the Rosetta space mission and the detection of phosphine in Venus&#x27; atmosphere.

Explaining the show&#x27;s enduring appeal, Moore said: &quot;Astronomy&#x27;s a fascinating subject. You look up... you can&#x27;t help getting interested and it&#x27;s there. We&#x27;ve tried to bring it to the people.. it&#x27;s not me, it&#x27;s the appeal of the subject.&quot;

==Presenters==

==Notable guests==
Many of the world&#x27;s leading astronomers have appeared on the show through the years, including Harlow Shapley (the first to measure the size of the Milky Way galaxy), Fred Hoyle, Carl Sagan, Jocelyn Bell Burnell, Samuel Tolansky, Harold Spencer Jones, Martin Ryle, Richard Ellis, Carlos Frenk and Bart Bok. Other guests have included Arthur C. Clarke, Astronomer Royal Sir Martin Rees, Arnold Wolfendale, Allan Chapman, Sir Bernard Lovell, Michael Bentine and Wernher von Braun.

Many well-known astronauts have also appeared on the programme, such as Piers Sellers, Eugene Cernan, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong.

In July 2004, Moore was unable to make the broadcast owing to a severe bout of salmonellosis. He was replaced for this one occasion by the cosmologist Chris Lintott of Oxford University, who had been co-presenting for several years. Moore returned for the August programme, this was the only occasion in the 55 years of Moore&#x27;s tenure that he did not host the programme.

Brian May, the Queen guitarist and astrophysicist, has occasionally been a guest on the show.

On 1 April 2007, Moore presented the 50th Anniversary edition of the show, a special &quot;time travel&quot; edition which included the appearance of Jon Culshaw as Moore&#x27;s younger self. The 50th anniversary programme was filmed at Teddington Studios as the 1957 home of the programme, Lime Grove Studios, had been demolished in 1992.

On 6 March 2011, Moore presented the 700th edition of the show, a special retrospective episode which included Jon Culshaw once again appearing as Moore&#x27;s younger self, as well as Brian May.

==Move to BBC Four==
In September 2013 the BBC announced that the programme&#x27;s future after December 2013 was under review, prompting speculation that the corporation would end it, and a petition asking for the show to be retained. On 29 October it was announced that the programme would continue, but would only be shown on BBC Four, ending a 54-year run on the BBC&#x27;s flagship channel.

==Commemorative honours==
The International Astronomical Union celebrated the 50th anniversary of the show by naming an asteroid 57424 Caelumnoctu, the number referring to the first broadcast date and the name being Latin for &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;.

In February 2007, the Royal Mail issued a set of six astronomy stamps to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the programme.

In the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, Patrick Moore is listed as the most prolific TV presenter in the world, having hosted all but one episode of the programme between 1957 and January 2013.

==DVD release==
A DVD of the special commemorative &quot;Sky at Night&quot; film &quot;Apollo 11: A Night to Remember&quot; was released on 6 July 2009 to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the first man on the Moon.

<doc id="186023" wikidata="Q7885166" url="?curid=186023" title="Unifying theories in mathematics">
<text>There have been several attempts in history to reach a unified theory of mathematics. Some of the most respected mathematicians in the academia have expressed views that the whole subject should be fitted into one theory (examples include Hilbert&#x27;s program and Langlands program).

The unification of mathematical topics has been called mathematical consolidation: &quot;By a &quot;consolidation&quot; of two or more concepts or theories &quot;T&quot;i we mean the creation of a new theory which incorporates elements of all the &quot;T&quot;i into one system which achieves more general implications than are obtainable from any single &quot;T&quot;i.&quot;

==Historical perspective==

The process of unification might be seen as helping to define what constitutes mathematics as a discipline.

For example, mechanics and mathematical analysis were commonly combined into one subject during the 18th century, united by the differential equation concept; while algebra and geometry were considered largely distinct. Now we consider analysis, algebra, and geometry, but not mechanics, as parts of mathematics because they are primarily deductive formal sciences, while mechanics like physics must proceed from observation. There is no major loss of content, with analytical mechanics in the old sense now expressed in terms of symplectic topology, based on the newer theory of manifolds.

==Mathematical theories==

The term &quot;theory&quot; is used informally within mathematics to mean a self-consistent body of definitions, axioms, theorems, examples, and so on. (Examples include group theory, Galois theory, control theory, and K-theory.) In particular there is no connotation of &quot;hypothetical&quot;. Thus the term &quot;unifying theory&quot; is more like a sociological term used to study the actions of mathematicians. It may assume nothing conjectural that would be analogous to an undiscovered scientific link. There is really no cognate within mathematics to such concepts as &quot;Proto-World&quot; in linguistics or the Gaia hypothesis.

Nonetheless there have been several episodes within the history of mathematics in which sets of individual theorems were found to be special cases of a single unifying result, or in which a single perspective about how to proceed when developing an area of mathematics could be applied fruitfully to multiple branches of the subject.

==Geometrical theories==

A well-known example was the development of analytic geometry, which in the hands of mathematicians such as Descartes and Fermat showed that many theorems about curves and surfaces of special types could be stated in algebraic language (then new), each of which could then be proved using the same techniques. That is, the theorems were very similar algebraically, even if the geometrical interpretations were distinct.

In 1859, Arthur Cayley initiated a unification of metric geometries through use of the Cayley-Klein metrics. Later Felix Klein used such metrics to provide a foundation for non-Euclidean geometry.

In 1872, Felix Klein noted that the many branches of geometry which had been developed during the 19th century (affine geometry, projective geometry, hyperbolic geometry, etc.) could all be treated in a uniform way. He did this by considering the groups under which the geometric objects were invariant. This unification of geometry goes by the name of the Erlangen programme.

The general theory of angle can be unified with invariant measure of area. The hyperbolic angle is defined in terms of area, very nearly the area associated with natural logarithm. The circular angle also has area interpretation when referred to a circle with radius equal to the square root of two. These areas are invariant with respect to hyperbolic rotation and circular rotation respectively. These affine transformations are effected by elements of the special linear group SL(2,R). Inspection of that group reveals shear mappings which increase or decrease slopes but differences of slope do not change. A third type of angle, also interpreted as an area dependent on slope differences, is invariant because of area preservation of a shear mapping.

==Through axiomatisation==

Early in the 20th century, many parts of mathematics began to be treated by delineating useful sets of axioms and then studying their consequences. Thus, for example, the studies of &quot;hypercomplex numbers&quot;, such as considered by the Quaternion Society, were put onto an axiomatic footing as branches of ring theory (in this case, with the specific meaning of associative algebras over the field of complex numbers). In this context, the quotient ring concept is one of the most powerful unifiers.

This was a general change of methodology, since the needs of applications had up until then meant that much of mathematics was taught by means of algorithms (or processes close to being algorithmic). Arithmetic is still taught that way. It was a parallel to the development of mathematical logic as a stand-alone branch of mathematics. By the 1930s symbolic logic itself was adequately included within mathematics.

In most cases, mathematical objects under study can be defined (albeit non-canonically) as sets or, more informally, as sets with additional structure such as an addition operation. Set theory now serves as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for the development of mathematical themes.

===Bourbaki===

The cause of axiomatic development was taken up in earnest by the Bourbaki group of mathematicians. Taken to its extreme, this attitude was thought to demand mathematics developed in its greatest generality. One started from the most general axioms, and then specialized, for example, by introducing modules over commutative rings, and limiting to vector spaces over the real numbers only when absolutely necessary. The story proceeded in this fashion, even when the specializations were the theorems of primary interest.

In particular, this perspective placed little value on fields of mathematics (such as combinatorics) whose objects of study are very often special, or found in situations which can only superficially be related to more axiomatic branches of the subject.

==Category theory as a rival==

Category theory is a unifying theory of mathematics that was initially developed in the second half of the 20th century. In this respect, it is an alternative and complement to set theory. A key theme from the &quot;categorical&quot; point of view is that mathematics requires not only certain kinds of objects (Lie groups, Banach spaces, etc.) but also mappings between them that preserve their structure.

In particular, this clarifies exactly what it means for mathematical objects to be considered to be &quot;the same&quot;. (For example, are all equilateral triangles &quot;the same&quot;, or does size matter?) Saunders Mac Lane proposed that any concept with enough &#x27;ubiquity&#x27; (occurring in various branches of mathematics) deserved isolating and studying in its own right. Category theory is arguably better adapted to that end than any other current approach. The disadvantages of relying on so-called &quot;abstract nonsense&quot; are a certain blandness and abstraction in the sense of breaking away from the roots in concrete problems. Nevertheless, the methods of category theory have steadily advanced in acceptance, in numerous areas (from D-modules to categorical logic).

==Uniting theories==

On a less grand scale, similarities between sets of results in two different branches of mathematics raise the question of whether a unifying framework exists that could explain the parallels. We have already noted the example of analytic geometry, and more generally the field of algebraic geometry thoroughly develops the connections between geometric objects (algebraic varieties, or more generally schemes) and algebraic ones (ideals); the touchstone result here is Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz, which roughly speaking shows that there is a natural one-to-one correspondence between the two types of objects.

One may view other theorems in the same light. For example, the fundamental theorem of Galois theory asserts that there is a one-to-one correspondence between extensions of a field and subgroups of the field&#x27;s Galois group. The Taniyama–Shimura conjecture for elliptic curves (now proven) establishes a one-to-one correspondence between curves defined as modular forms and elliptic curves defined over the rational numbers. A research area sometimes nicknamed Monstrous Moonshine developed connections between modular forms and the finite simple group known as the Monster, starting solely with the surprise observation that in each of them the rather unusual number 196884 would arise very naturally. Another field, known as the Langlands program, likewise starts with apparently haphazard similarities (in this case, between number-theoretical results and representations of certain groups) and looks for constructions from which both sets of results would be corollaries.

==Reference list of major unifying concepts==

A short list of these theories might include:

==Recent developments in relation with modular theory==

A well-known example is the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, now the modularity theorem, which proposed that each elliptic curve over the rational numbers can be translated into a modular form (in such a way as to preserve the associated L-function). There are difficulties in identifying this with an isomorphism, in any strict sense of the word. Certain curves had been known to be both elliptic curves (of genus 1) and modular curves, before the conjecture was formulated (about 1955). The surprising part of the conjecture was the extension to factors of Jacobians of modular curves of genus &gt; 1. It had probably not seemed plausible that there would be &#x27;enough&#x27; such rational factors, before the conjecture was enunciated; and in fact the numerical evidence was slight until around 1970, when tables began to confirm it. The case of elliptic curves with complex multiplication was proved by Shimura in 1964. This conjecture stood for decades before being proved in generality.

In fact the Langlands program (or philosophy) is much more like a web of unifying conjectures; it really does postulate that the general theory of automorphic forms is regulated by the L-groups introduced by Robert Langlands. His &quot;principle of functoriality&quot; with respect to the L-group has a very large explanatory value with respect to known types of &quot;lifting&quot; of automorphic forms (now more broadly studied as automorphic representations). While this theory is in one sense closely linked with the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, it should be understood that the conjecture actually operates in the opposite direction. It requires the existence of an automorphic form, starting with an object that (very abstractly) lies in a category of motives.

Another significant related point is that the Langlands approach stands apart from the whole development triggered by monstrous moonshine (connections between elliptic modular functions as Fourier series, and the group representations of the Monster group and other sporadic groups). The Langlands philosophy neither foreshadowed nor was able to include this line of research.

==Isomorphism conjectures in K-theory==

Another case, which so far is less well-developed but covers a wide range of mathematics, is the conjectural basis of some parts of K-theory. The Baum–Connes conjecture, now a long-standing problem, has been joined by others in a group known as the isomorphism conjectures in K-theory. These include the Farrell–Jones conjecture and Bost conjecture.

<doc id="186024" wikidata="Q1382423" url="?curid=186024" title="Zante currant">
<text>Zante currants, Corinth raisins, Corinthian raisins or outside the United States simply currants, are raisins of the small, sweet, seedless grape cultivar Black Corinth (&quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;). The name comes from the Anglo-French phrase &quot;raisins de Corinthe&quot; (grapes of Corinth) and the Ionian island of Zakynthos (Zante), which was once the major producer and exporter. It is not related to black, red or white currants, which are berries of shrubs in the genus &quot;Ribes&quot; and not usually prepared in dried form.

==History==
The Zante currant is one of the oldest known raisins. The first written record of the grape was made in 75 AD by Pliny the Elder, who described a tiny, juicy, thin-skinned grape with small bunches. The next mention is a millennium later, when the raisins became a subject of trade between Venetian merchants and Greek producers from Ionian coasts. In the 14th century, they were sold in the English market under the label &quot;Reysyns de Corauntz&quot;, and the name &quot;raisins of Corinth&quot; was recorded in the 15th century, after the Greek harbor which was the primary source of export. Gradually, the name was altered to currant. By the 17th century trade shifted towards the Ionian islands, particularly Zakynthos (Zante), resulting in the name &quot;Zante currant&quot;.

===In the U.S.===
The first attempts to introduce the Black Corinth cultivar in the United States date back to 1854. The first successful vineyards of White and Red Corinth (related varieties), were established in California in 1861 by Colonel Ágoston Haraszthy. Around 1901, David Fairchild of USDA imported high-quality black currant cuttings from the Greek village of Panariti, a renowned producer, and established the first commercial crops. However, because of the higher popularity of Thompson Seedless, American production remained modest up to 1920s and 1930s, after which its popularity increased due to the higher prices it could bring and improved cultivation practices such as girdling. The plantings reached by 1936, and have plateaued there since.

==Description==
In wild grapes, the species is dioecious; the sexes grow on separate vines with male flowers on one plant, and female flowers on another. Black Corinth is an &quot;almost male&quot; variety in that the flowers have well-developed anthers (male), but only tiny underdeveloped ovaries (female).

Clusters of Black Corinth are small, averaging and ranging from . They are cylindrical, with prominent shoulder or winged. The berries are very small , round, and of a reddish black color. The skin is very thin, and the flesh is juicy and soft. It is practically seedless, except in an occasional large berry. When dried, the raisins weigh and are dark brown or black. Leaves are
medium-sized, heart-shaped, and oblong. They are five-lobed with deep sinuses.

==Cultivation==
To yield sufficient fruit, Black Corinth grapes need to be carefully managed. In ancient times, girdling was a standard practice to increase the set and size of seedless grapes, until the discovery of the plant hormone gibberellic acid, and its ability to do the same thing with less labor. Historically, Black Corinth stock was probably kept for its pollen-producing abilities, so other female flowered varieties (with naturally higher yields) would set full crops.

The Black Corinth cultivar is also reputed to be very prone to powdery mildew, and is susceptible to numerous other diseases such as downy mildew and black rot.

Greece is still the primary producer of Zante currants, amounting to about 80% of total world production, with California, South Africa and Australia sharing most of the remainder.
==Culinary use==


Zante currants are usually called simply &quot;currants&quot;, except in the U.S., and in many anglophone countries are used in traditional baked goods and puddings.

They have been a key ingredient of British cuisine for centuries, having been imported from the Mediterranean as sweet luxury goods long before cane sugar became widely available in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Alongside raisins and sultanas they feature heavily in a wide variety of traditional baked goods recipes, including fruitcake, currant buns, teacakes, Eccles cakes, Saffron cake, bread and butter pudding, spotted dick, Welsh cakes, Bara brith, Christmas pudding and mince pies. They are also a major ingredient of currant slice (or currant square) and currant cake.

Zante currants are often sold in mixtures of &quot;mixed dried fruit&quot;.

Unlike blackcurrants, Zante currants are not a significant source of vitamin C. The fresh fruit Zante raisins are made from is very small and sweet, with quite an intense flavour for a grape. Black, White and Red Corinth are often marketed under the name &quot;Champagne grapes&quot; in U.S. specialty stores, but they are not used for making Champagne.

==Toxicity==
Along with grapes and raisins, Zante currants are nephrotoxic to dogs. This toxicity manifests as kidney failure and can be seen in relatively small doses.

<text>In statistics, regression toward the mean (also called regression to the mean, reversion to the mean, and reversion to mediocrity) is the phenomenon where if one sample of a random variable is extreme, the next sampling of the same random variable is likely to be closer to its mean. Furthermore, when many random variables are sampled and the most extreme results are intentionally picked out, it refers to the fact that (in many cases) a second sampling of these picked-out variables will result in &quot;less extreme&quot; results, closer to the initial mean of all of the variables.

Mathematically, the strength of this &quot;regression&quot; effect is dependent on whether or not all of the random variables are drawn from the same distribution, or if there are genuine differences in the underlying distributions for each random variable. In the first case, the &quot;regression&quot; effect is statistically likely to occur, but in the second case, it may occur less strongly or not at all.

Regression toward the mean is thus a useful concept to consider when designing any scientific experiment, data analysis, or test, which intentionally selects the most extreme events - it indicates that follow-up checks may be useful in order to avoid jumping to false conclusions about these events; they may be genuine extreme events, a completely meaningless selection due to statistical noise, or a mix of the two cases.

==Conceptual examples==
===Simple example: students taking a test===
Consider a class of students taking a 100-item true/false test on a subject. Suppose that all students choose randomly on all questions. Then, each student&#x27;s score would be a realization of one of a set of independent and identically distributed random variables, with an expected mean of 50. Naturally, some students will score substantially above 50 and some substantially below 50 just by chance. If one selects only the top scoring 10% of the students and gives them a second test on which they again choose randomly on all items, the mean score would again be expected to be close to 50. Thus the mean of these students would &quot;regress&quot; all the way back to the mean of all students who took the original test. No matter what a student scores on the original test, the best prediction of their score on the second test is 50.

If choosing answers to the test questions was not random – i.e. if there were no luck (good or bad) or random guessing involved in the answers supplied by the students – then all students would be expected to score the same on the second test as they scored on the original test, and there would be no regression toward the mean.

Most realistic situations fall between these two extremes: for example, one might consider exam scores as a combination of skill and luck. In this case, the subset of students scoring above average would be composed of those who were skilled and had not especially bad luck, together with those who were unskilled, but were extremely lucky. On a retest of this subset, the unskilled will be unlikely to repeat their lucky break, while the skilled will have a second chance to have bad luck. Hence, those who did well previously are unlikely to do quite as well in the second test even if the original cannot be replicated.

The following is an example of this second kind of regression toward the mean. A class of students takes two editions of the same test on two successive days. It has frequently been observed that the worst performers on the first day will tend to improve their scores on the second day, and the best performers on the first day will tend to do worse on the second day. The phenomenon occurs because student scores are determined in part by underlying ability and in part by chance. For the first test, some will be lucky, and score more than their ability, and some will be unlucky and score less than their ability. Some of the lucky students on the first test will be lucky again on the second test, but more of them will have (for them) average or below average scores. Therefore, a student who was lucky and over-performed their ability on the first test is more likely to have a worse score on the second test than a better score. Similarly, students who unluckily score less than their ability on the first test will tend to see their scores increase on the second test. The larger the influence of luck in producing an extreme event, the less likely the luck will repeat itself in multiple events.

===Other examples===
If your favourite sports team won the championship last year, what does that mean for their chances for winning next season? To the extent this result is due to skill (the team is in good condition, with a top coach, etc.), their win signals that it is more likely they will win again next year. But the greater the extent this is due to luck (other teams embroiled in a drug scandal, favourable draw, draft picks turned out to be productive, etc.), the less likely it is they will win again next year.

If a business organisation has a highly profitable quarter, despite the underlying reasons for its performance being unchanged, it is likely to do less well the next quarter.

Baseball players who hit well in their rookie season are likely to do worse their second; the &quot;sophomore slump&quot;. Similarly, regression toward the mean is an explanation for the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; cover jinx — periods of exceptional performance which results in a cover feature are likely to be followed by periods of more mediocre performance, giving the impression that appearing on the cover causes an athlete&#x27;s decline.

==History==
===Discovery===

The concept of regression comes from genetics and was popularized by Sir Francis Galton during the late 19th century with the publication of &quot;Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature&quot;. Galton observed that extreme characteristics (e.g., height) in parents are not passed on completely to their offspring. Rather, the characteristics in the offspring &quot;regress&quot; toward a &quot;mediocre&quot; point (a point which has since been identified as the mean). By measuring the heights of hundreds of people, he was able to quantify regression to the mean, and estimate the size of the effect. Galton wrote that, &quot;the average regression of the offspring is a constant fraction of their respective mid-parental deviations&quot;. This means that the difference between a child and its parents for some characteristic is proportional to its parents&#x27; deviation from typical people in the population. If its parents are each two inches taller than the averages for men and women, then, on average, the offspring will be shorter than its parents by some factor (which, today, we would call one minus the regression coefficient) times two inches. For height, Galton estimated this coefficient to be about 2/3: the height of an individual will measure around a midpoint that is two thirds of the parents&#x27; deviation from the population average.

Galton also published these results using the simpler example of pellets falling through a Galton board to form a normal distribution centred directly under their entrance point. These pellets might then be released down into a second gallery corresponding to a second measurement. Galton then asked the reverse question: &quot;From where did these pellets come?&quot; The answer was not ″&quot;on average directly above&quot;″. Rather it was ″&quot;on average, more towards the middle&quot;″, for the simple reason that there were more pellets above it towards the middle that could wander left than there were in the left extreme that could wander to the right, inwards.

===Evolving usage of the term===
Galton coined the term &quot;regression&quot; to describe an observable fact in the inheritance of multi-factorial quantitative genetic traits: namely that traits of the offspring of parents who lie at the tails of the distribution often tend to lie closer to the centre, the mean, of the distribution. He quantified this trend, and in doing so invented linear regression analysis, thus laying the groundwork for much of modern statistical modeling. Since then, the term &quot;regression&quot; has been used in other contexts, and it may be used by modern statisticians to describe phenomena such as sampling bias which have little to do with Galton&#x27;s original observations in the field of genetics.

Galton&#x27;s explanation for the regression phenomenon he observed in biology was stated as follows: &quot;A child inherits partly from his parents, partly from his ancestors. Speaking generally, the further his genealogy goes back, the more numerous and varied will his ancestry become, until they cease to differ from any equally numerous sample taken at haphazard from the race at large.&quot; Galton&#x27;s statement requires some clarification in light of knowledge of genetics: Children receive genetic material from their parents, but hereditary information (e.g. values of inherited traits) from earlier ancestors can be passed through their parents (and may not have been expressed in their parents). The mean for the trait may be nonrandom and determined by selection pressure, but the distribution of values around the mean reflects a normal statistical distribution.

The population-genetic phenomenon studied by Galton is a special case of &quot;regression to the mean&quot;; the term is often used to describe many statistical phenomena in which data exhibit a normal distribution around a mean.

==Importance==
Regression toward the mean is a significant consideration in the design of experiments.

Take a hypothetical example of 1,000 individuals of a similar age who were examined and scored on the risk of experiencing a heart attack. Statistics could be used to measure the success of an intervention on the 50 who were rated at the greatest risk, as measured by a test with a degree of uncertainty. The intervention could be a change in diet, exercise, or a drug treatment. Even if the interventions are worthless, the test group would be expected to show an improvement on their next physical exam, because of regression toward the mean. The best way to combat this effect is to divide the group randomly into a treatment group that receives the treatment, and a group that does not. The treatment would then be judged effective only if the treatment group improves more than the untreated group.

Alternatively, a group of disadvantaged children could be tested to identify the ones with most college potential. The top 1% could be identified and supplied with special enrichment courses, tutoring, counseling and computers. Even if the program is effective, their average scores may well be less when the test is repeated a year later. However, in these circumstances it may be considered unethical to have a control group of disadvantaged children whose special needs are ignored. A mathematical calculation for shrinkage can adjust for this effect, although it will not be as reliable as the control group method (see also Stein&#x27;s example).

The effect can also be exploited for general inference and estimation. The hottest place in the country today is more likely to be cooler tomorrow than hotter, as compared to today. The best performing mutual fund over the last three years is more likely to see relative performance decline than improve over the next three years. The most successful Hollywood actor of this year is likely to have less gross, rather than more gross, for their next movie. The baseball player with the highest batting average partway through the season is more likely to have a lower average than a higher average over the remainder of the season.

===Misunderstandings===
The concept of regression toward the mean can be misused very easily.

In the student test example above, it was assumed implicitly that what was being measured did not change between the two measurements. Suppose, however, that the course was pass/fail and students were required to score above 70 on both tests to pass. Then the students who scored under 70 the first time would have no incentive to do well, and might score worse on average the second time. The students just over 70, on the other hand, would have a strong incentive to study and concentrate while taking the test. In that case one might see movement &quot;away&quot; from 70, scores below it getting lower and scores above it getting higher. It is possible for changes between the measurement times to augment, offset or reverse the statistical tendency to regress toward the mean.

Statistical regression toward the mean is not a causal phenomenon. A student with the worst score on the test on the first day will not necessarily increase his score substantially on the second day due to the effect. On average, the worst scorers improve, but that is only true because the worst scorers are more likely to have been unlucky than lucky. To the extent that a score is determined randomly, or that a score has random variation or error, as opposed to being determined by the student&#x27;s academic ability or being a &quot;true value&quot;, the phenomenon will have an effect. A classic mistake in this regard was in education. The students that received praise for good work were noticed to do more poorly on the next measure, and the students who were punished for poor work were noticed to do better on the next measure. The educators decided to stop praising and keep punishing on this basis. Such a decision was a mistake, because regression toward the mean is not based on cause and effect, but rather on random error in a natural distribution around a mean.

Although extreme individual measurements regress toward the mean, the second sample of measurements will be no closer to the mean than the first. Consider the students again. Suppose the tendency of extreme individuals is to regress 10% of the way toward the mean of 80, so a student who scored 100 the first day is expected to score 98 the second day, and a student who scored 70 the first day is expected to score 71 the second day. Those expectations are closer to the mean than the first day scores. But the second day scores will vary around their expectations; some will be higher and some will be lower. For extreme individuals, we expect the second score to be closer to the mean than the first score, but for &quot;all&quot; individuals, we expect the distribution of distances from the mean to be the same on both sets of measurements.

Related to the point above, regression toward the mean works equally well in both directions. We expect the student with the highest test score on the second day to have done worse on the first day. And if we compare the best student on the first day to the best student on the second day, regardless of whether it is the same individual or not, there is no tendency to regress toward the mean going in either direction. We expect the best scores on both days to be equally far from the mean.

===Regression fallacies===
Many phenomena tend to be attributed to the wrong causes when regression to the mean is not taken into account.

An extreme example is Horace Secrist&#x27;s 1933 book &quot;The Triumph of Mediocrity in Business&quot;, in which the statistics professor collected mountains of data to prove that the profit rates of competitive businesses tend toward the average over time. In fact, there is no such effect; the variability of profit rates is almost constant over time. Secrist had only described the common regression toward the mean. One exasperated reviewer, Harold Hotelling, likened the book to &quot;proving the multiplication table by arranging elephants in rows and columns, and then doing the same for numerous other kinds of animals&quot;.

The calculation and interpretation of &quot;improvement scores&quot; on standardized educational tests in Massachusetts probably provides another example of the regression fallacy. In 1999, schools were given improvement goals. For each school, the Department of Education tabulated the difference in the average score achieved by students in 1999 and in 2000. It was quickly noted that most of the worst-performing schools had met their goals, which the Department of Education took as confirmation of the soundness of their policies. However, it was also noted that many of the supposedly best schools in the Commonwealth, such as Brookline High School (with 18 National Merit Scholarship finalists) were declared to have failed. As in many cases involving statistics and public policy, the issue is debated, but &quot;improvement scores&quot; were not announced in subsequent years and the findings appear to be a case of regression to the mean.

The psychologist Daniel Kahneman, winner of the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, pointed out that regression to the mean might explain why rebukes can seem to improve performance, while praise seems to backfire.

The regression fallacy is also explained in Rolf Dobelli&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Thinking Clearly&quot;.

UK law enforcement policies have encouraged the visible siting of static or mobile speed cameras at accident blackspots. This policy was justified by a perception that there is a corresponding reduction in serious road traffic accidents after a camera is set up. However, statisticians have pointed out that, although there is a net benefit in lives saved, failure to take into account the effects of regression to the mean results in the beneficial effects being overstated.

Statistical analysts have long recognized the effect of regression to the mean in sports; they even have a special name for it: the &quot;sophomore slump&quot;. For example, Carmelo Anthony of the NBA&#x27;s Denver Nuggets had an outstanding rookie season in 2004. It was so outstanding that he could not be expected to repeat it: in 2005, Anthony&#x27;s numbers had dropped from his rookie season. The reasons for the &quot;sophomore slump&quot; abound, as sports rely on adjustment and counter-adjustment, but luck-based excellence as a rookie is as good a reason as any. Regression to the mean in sports performance may also explain the apparent &quot;&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; cover jinx&quot; and the &quot;Madden Curse&quot;. John Hollinger has an alternative name for the phenomenon of regression to the mean: the &quot;fluke rule&quot;, while Bill James calls it the &quot;Plexiglas Principle&quot;.

Because popular lore has focused on regression toward the mean as an account of declining performance of athletes from one season to the next, it has usually overlooked the fact that such regression can also account for improved performance. For example, if one looks at the batting average of Major League Baseball players in one season, those whose batting average was above the league mean tend to regress downward toward the mean the following year, while those whose batting average was below the mean tend to progress upward toward the mean the following year.

===Other statistical phenomena===

Regression toward the mean simply says that, following an extreme random event, the next random event is likely to be less extreme. In no sense does the future event &quot;compensate for&quot; or &quot;even out&quot; the previous event, though this is assumed in the gambler&#x27;s fallacy (and the variant law of averages). Similarly, the law of large numbers states that in the long term, the average will tend toward the expected value, but makes no statement about individual trials. For example, following a run of 10 heads on a flip of a fair coin (a rare, extreme event), regression to the mean states that the next run of heads will likely be less than 10, while the law of large numbers states that in the long term, this event will likely average out, and the average fraction of heads will tend to 1/2. By contrast, the gambler&#x27;s fallacy incorrectly assumes that the coin is now &quot;due&quot; for a run of tails to balance out.

The opposite effect is regression to the tail, resulting from a distribution with non-vanishing probability density toward infinity.

==Definition for simple linear regression of data points==
This is the definition of regression toward the mean that closely follows Sir Francis Galton&#x27;s original usage.

Suppose there are &quot;n&quot; data points {&quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;}, where &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;. We want to find the equation of the regression line, &quot;i.e.&quot; the straight line
: formula_1
which would provide a best fit for the data points. (A straight line may not be the appropriate regression curve for the given data points.) Here the best will be understood as in the least-squares approach: such a line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals of the linear regression model. In other words, numbers &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; solve the following minimization problem:

: Find formula_2, where formula_3

Using calculus it can be shown that the values of &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; that minimize the objective function &quot;Q&quot; are
: formula_4

where &quot;rxy&quot; is the sample correlation coefficient between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, &quot;sx&quot; is the standard deviation of &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;sy&quot; is correspondingly the standard deviation of &quot;y&quot;. Horizontal bar over a variable means the sample average of that variable. For example: formula_5

Substituting the above expressions for formula_6 and formula_7 into formula_1 yields fitted values
: formula_9

which yields
: formula_10

This shows the role &quot;r&quot;&quot;xy&quot; plays in the regression line of standardized data points.

If −1 &lt; &quot;r&quot;&quot;xy&quot; &lt; 1, then we say that the data points exhibit regression toward the mean. In other words, if linear regression is the appropriate model for a set of data points whose sample correlation coefficient is not perfect, then there is regression toward the mean. The predicted (or fitted) standardized value of &quot;y&quot; is closer to its mean than the standardized value of &quot;x&quot; is to its mean.

==Definitions for bivariate distribution with identical marginal distributions==

===Restrictive definition===
Let &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2 be random variables with identical marginal distributions with mean &quot;μ&quot;. In this formalization, the bivariate distribution of &quot;X&quot;1 and &quot;X&quot;2 is said to exhibit regression toward the mean if, for every number &quot;c&quot; &gt; &quot;μ&quot;, we have
:&quot;μ&quot; ≤ E[&quot;X&quot;2 | &quot;X&quot;1 = &quot;c&quot;] &lt; &quot;c&quot;,
with the reverse inequalities holding for &quot;c&quot; &lt; &quot;μ&quot;.

The following is an informal description of the above definition. Consider a population of widgets. Each widget has two numbers, &quot;X&quot;1 and &quot;X&quot;2 (say, its left span (&quot;X&quot;1 ) and right span (&quot;X&quot;2)). Suppose that the probability distributions of &quot;X&quot;1 and &quot;X&quot;2 in the population are identical, and that the means of &quot;X&quot;1 and &quot;X&quot;2 are both &quot;μ&quot;. We now take a random widget from the population, and denote its &quot;X&quot;1 value by &quot;c&quot;. (&quot;c&quot; may be greater than, equal to, or smaller than &quot;μ&quot;.) We have no access to the value of this widget&#x27;s &quot;X&quot;2 yet. Let &quot;d&quot; denote the expected value of &quot;X&quot;2 of this particular widget. (&quot;i.e.&quot; Let &quot;d&quot; denote the average value of &quot;X&quot;2 of all widgets in the population with &quot;X&quot;1=&quot;c&quot;.) If the following condition is true:
:Whatever the value &quot;c&quot; is, &quot;d&quot; lies between &quot;μ&quot; and &quot;c&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; &quot;d&quot; is closer to &quot;μ&quot; than &quot;c &quot; is),

then we say that &quot;X&quot;1 and &quot;X&quot;2 show regression toward the mean.

This definition accords closely with the current common usage, evolved from Galton&#x27;s original usage, of the term &quot;regression toward the mean&quot;. It is &quot;restrictive&quot; in the sense that not every bivariate distribution with identical marginal distributions exhibits regression toward the mean (under this definition).

====Theorem====

If a pair (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) of random variables follows a bivariate normal distribution, then the conditional mean E(&quot;Y&quot;|&quot;X&quot;) is a linear function of &quot;X&quot;. The correlation coefficient &quot;r&quot; between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, along with the marginal means and variances of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, determines this linear relationship:
:formula_11

where &quot;E[X]&quot; and &quot;E[Y]&quot; are the expected values of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, respectively, and σ&quot;x&quot; and σ&quot;y&quot; are the standard deviations of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, respectively.

Hence the conditional expected value of &quot;Y&quot;, given that &quot;X&quot; is &quot;t&quot; standard deviations above its mean (and that includes the case where it&#x27;s below its mean, when &quot;t&quot; &lt; 0), is &quot;rt&quot; standard deviations above the mean of &quot;Y&quot;. Since |&quot;r&quot;| ≤ 1, &quot;Y&quot; is no farther from the mean than &quot;X&quot; is, as measured in the number of standard deviations.

Hence, if 0 ≤ &quot;r&quot; &lt; 1, then (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) shows regression toward the mean (by this definition).

===General definition===
The following definition of &quot;reversion toward the mean&quot; has been proposed by Samuels as an alternative to the more restrictive definition of &quot;regression toward the mean&quot; above.

Let &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2 be random variables with identical marginal distributions with mean &quot;μ&quot;. In this formalization, the bivariate distribution of &quot;X&quot;1 and &quot;X&quot;2 is said to exhibit reversion toward the mean if, for every number &quot;c&quot;, we have
:&quot;μ&quot; ≤ E[&quot;X&quot;2 | &quot;X&quot;1 &gt; &quot;c&quot;] &lt; E[&quot;X&quot;1 | &quot;X&quot;1 &gt; &quot;c&quot;], and
:&quot;μ&quot; ≥ E[&quot;X&quot;2 | &quot;X&quot;1 &lt; &quot;c&quot;] &gt; E[&quot;X&quot;1 | &quot;X&quot;1 &lt; &quot;c&quot;]

This definition is &quot;general&quot; in the sense that every bivariate distribution with identical marginal distributions exhibits &quot;reversion toward the mean&quot;, provided some weak criteria are satisfied (non-degeneracy and weak positive dependence as described in Samuels&#x27;s paper).

==Alternative definition in financial usage==

Jeremy Siegel uses the term &quot;return to the mean&quot; to describe a financial time series in which &quot;returns can be very unstable in the short run but very stable in the long run.&quot; More quantitatively, it is one in which the standard deviation of average annual returns declines faster than the inverse of the holding period, implying that the process is not a random walk, but that periods of lower returns are systematically followed by compensating periods of higher returns, as is the case in many seasonal businesses, for example.

<text>Ellen Burstyn (born Edna Rae Gillooly; December 7, 1932) is an American actress. Known for her portrayals of complex women in dramas, she is the recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a Tony Award, and two Primetime Emmy Awards, making her one of the few performers to achieve the &quot;Triple Crown of Acting&quot;. She has also received a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award.

Burstyn made her acting debut on Broadway in &quot;Fair Game&quot; in 1957 before winning the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; (1975). She earned the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as the widow Alice Hyatt in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1974). Her other Oscar-nominated roles were in &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971), &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; (1978), &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1980), and &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (2000). Her other notable films include &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; (1974), &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot; (1995), &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; (2002), &quot;W.&quot; (2008), &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014), &quot;The Age of Adaline&quot; (2015), and &quot;Pieces of a Woman&quot; (2020).

She won Primetime Emmy Awards for her guest role in the NBC legal drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (2009), and for her supporting role in the USA Network political miniseries &quot;Political Animals&quot; (2013). Her other Emmy-nominated roles include &quot;Pack of Lies&quot; (1988), &quot;Mrs. Harris&quot; (2005), &quot;Big Love&quot; (2008), &quot;Draft Day&quot;, &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; (both 2014), and &quot;House of Cards&quot; (2016). Since 2000, she has been co-president of the Actors Studio, a drama school in New York City. In 2013, she was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame for her work onstage.

==Early life==
Burstyn was born Edna Rae Gillooly on December 7, 1932, in Detroit, the daughter of Correine Marie (née Hamel) and John Austin Gillooly. She says her ancestry is &quot;Irish, French, Pennsylvania Dutch, a little Canadian Indian&quot;. Burstyn has an older brother, Jack, and a younger brother, Steve. Her parents divorced when she was young, and she and her brothers lived with their mother and stepfather.

Burstyn attended Cass Technical High School, a university-preparatory school that allowed students to choose a specific field of study. Burstyn majored in fashion illustration. In high school she was a cheerleader, a member of the student council, and president of her drama club. She dropped out of high school during her senior year after failing her classes. Soon afterward, Burstyn worked as a dancer using the name Kerri Flynn, and then a model until the age of 23. She later moved to Dallas, where she continued modeling and worked in other fashion jobs before moving to New York City.

From 1955 to 1956, Burstyn appeared as an &quot;away we go&quot; dancing girl on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; under the name Erica Dean. Burstyn then decided to become an actress and chose the name &quot;Ellen McRae&quot; as her professional name; she later changed her surname after her 1964 marriage to Neil Burstyn.

==Career==

=== 1958–1970: Early work and Broadway debut ===
Burstyn debuted on Broadway in 1957 and joined Lee Strasberg&#x27;s The Actors Studio in New York City in 1967. Starting in the late 1950s, and throughout the 1960s, Burstyn frequently played guest roles on a number of primetime television shows, including &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;The Big Valley&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Laramie&quot; and &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;. Burstyn was credited as Ellen McRae until 1967, when she and her then-husband Neil Nephew both changed their surname to Burstyn, and she began to be credited as Ellen Burstyn. In 1970, she appeared uncredited in the Joseph Strick adaptation of Henry Miller&#x27;s controversial novel &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;. In 1975, she won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play for her performance in the comedy &quot;Same Time, Next Year,&quot; a role she reprised in a film adaptation in 1978.

=== 1971–1979: Breakthrough, acclaim and awards success ===
After many small film roles, Burstyn gained recognition after starring in &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971), a coming-of-age story, directed by Peter Bogdanovich and adapted from a semi-autobiographical 1966 novel by Larry McMurtry. The film received critical acclaim for its nostalgia and visual style that is reminiscent of 1951, the year in which the plot takes place. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Burstyn and her co-star Cloris Leachman, with the latter winning the award. In 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Next she appeared in the drama &quot;The King of Marvin Gardens&quot; in 1972, with Jack Nicholson, Bruce Dern, and Scatman Crothers. A story about a daydreamer who convinces his brother to help fund a get-rich-quick scheme, the film was well received by critics.

In 1972, Burstyn was keen to play the lead role as Chris MacNeil in the supernatural horror film &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973). The film studio was initially reluctant to cast her, but when no other actors were put forward, Burstyn was chosen for the part. Her co-stars were Max von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb, Kitty Winn, Jack MacGowran, Jason Miller, and Linda Blair. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; had a production budget of $12 million, and its principal photography was held in various parts of New York City. Filming proved to be challenging for the entire cast; it took &quot;six-day weeks, twelve-hour days for nine months&quot; to film, and director William Friedkin used a prop gun to get genuine reactions from the cast. Burstyn also injured her coccyx, which led to permanent injury to her spine. Film critic Roger Ebert praised Burstyn for her ability to capture MacNeil&#x27;s &quot;frustration&quot; when her daughter is possessed by an evil spirit. Against expectations, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was a major commercial success at the box-office. Adjusted for inflation, the film is the ninth highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S. and Canada and the top-grossing R-rated film of all time. It won two Academy Awards – Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing, and earned Burstyn her first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Burstyn followed up with a small role in the comedy-drama &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; (1974). Her next major role was in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1974) where she played a widowed woman, raising a son and yearning to start a new life for herself as a singer. She was drawn to the script because of the character&#x27;s resemblance to her own life. Burstyn was also inspired by the works of Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, who found that women were searching to &quot;redefine their roles in society&quot;. Burstyn was offered to direct but turned it down to concentrate on her performance, but selected then-newcomer Scorsese as director and recalled the collaboration as &quot;one of the best experiences I&#x27;ve ever had&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Burstyn never misses the eccentric beat that distinguishes it—that makes Alice such a hugely appealing character who is both banal and very rare&quot;. Her performance in the film earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1975, she became a graduate of the first group of participants in the American Film Institute Directing Workshop for Women. In 1977, she served as a member of the jury at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival.

Burstyn played supporting roles in &quot;Providence&quot; (1977) and &quot;A Dream of Passion&quot; (1978). Although the films were independent dramas and not widely seen, the latter was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Also in 1978, Burstyn starred in &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; opposite Alan Alda&quot;,&quot; a romantic-comedy about two people, married to others, who meet for a romantic tryst once a year for two decades. The film is based on a 1975 play of the same title by Bernard Slade. Upon its release on November 22, the film garnered mixed reviews, with Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stating, &quot;Slade&#x27;s screenplay isn&#x27;t often funny, and it&#x27;s full of momentous events that can&#x27;t be laughed away&quot;, but praises Burstyn for giving the role &quot;warmth and grace&quot;. &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot; received four Academy Award nominations, including a third Best actress nomination for Burstyn. At the annual Golden Globe Awards, Burstyn won Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, while the film received two other nominations—Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for Alda and Best Original Song.

=== 1980–1998: Established actress ===
Burstyn hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, a late-night sketch comedy and variety show, in December 1980. That year, Burstyn starred in the drama &quot;Resurrection&quot;, a story about a woman who possesses strange powers after a surviving an automobile crash. Her performance in the film earned her a fourth nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress and a third nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama. In 1981, she starred in the biographical television film &quot;The People vs. Jean Harris&quot; (1981), based on the real life murder of Herman Tarnower, a well-known cardiologist and author of the best-selling book &quot;The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet&quot;. Burstyn&#x27;s portrayal of the murdereress, Jean Harris, earned her nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film. In 1981, Burstyn recorded &quot;The Ballad of the Nazi Soldier&#x27;s Wife&quot; for Ben Bagley&#x27;s album &quot;Kurt Weill Revisited, Vol. 2&quot;.

In the mid-1980s, Burstyn starred in several television films, including &quot;The Ambassador&quot; (1984), (1985), &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; (1985), &quot;Act of Vengeance&quot; (1986), &quot;Something in Common&quot; (1986) and a 1987 adaptation of the play &quot;Pack of Lies&quot;, which was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards, including another for Burstyn as Outstanding Actress in a Mini-Series or Movie. For the theatrical release &quot;Twice in a Lifetime&quot; (1985), co-starring Gene Hackman and Ann-Margret, she portrayed Kate, the wife whom Hackman&#x27;s character divorces when he falls in love with another woman.

In 1986, Burstyn starred in an ABC television sitcom, &quot;The Ellen Burstyn Show,&quot; with co-stars Megan Mullally as her daughter and Elaine Stritch as her mother. Created by David Frankel it ran only for one season. In 1987, she appeared in &quot;Hanna&#x27;s War&quot; (1987), and the television movies &quot;Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam&quot; and &quot;Look Away&quot;. In 1988, she then participated again as a member of the jury for the 38th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 1990, Burstyn won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre. A variety of acting performances followed suit, including in the dramas &quot;When You Remember Me&quot; (1990), &quot;Dying Young&quot; (1991) and &quot;Grand Isle&quot; (1991). In addition to television movies, Burstyn appeared in &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; (1994) with co-stars Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan.

In 1995, Burstyn portrayed Judith in the comedy-drama &quot;Roommates&quot; (1995). The film received negative reviews and emerged as a commercial failure at the box-office, but received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling. Also that year, Burstyn appeared in &quot;How to Make an American Quilt&quot; (1995), based on the 1991 novel of the same name by Whitney Otto, which tells the stories of several generations of women who are part of the same quilting circle. Despite a mixed critical response, the cast received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

In 1998, Burstyn appeared in &quot;Playing By Heart&quot;, with co-stars including Sean Connery and Angelina Jolie, a story of eleven ordinary people in Los Angeles who are connected in different ways. Some critics such as Roger Ebert viewed the film positively despite its lackluster performance at the box office. Burstyn next found supporting roles in &quot;The Spitfire Grill&quot; (1996), about a woman starting a new life after being released from prison, and &quot;Deceiver&quot; (1997), a murder crime drama. Although not box office hits, each film garnered mixed to positive responses, according to film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Next, she appeared in James Gray&#x27;s &quot;The Yards&quot; (2000) alongside a principal cast of Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix, Charlize Theron, Faye Dunaway and James Caan. The crime drama was unpopular and a commercial failure, earning less than $1 million worldwide from a budget of $24 million.

=== 1999–2009: Dramas and television work ===
In 1999, director Darren Aronofsky offered Burstyn the role of Sara Goldfarb in the psychological drama &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (2000). She initially rejected the part, objecting to the depressive nature of the story; however, she changed her mind after seeing Aronofsky&#x27;s previous work. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby Jr, which tells the story of four New Yorkers whose lives are affected by drug addictions. To prepare for the role, Burstyn had to research troubled women in Brooklyn, &quot;to get their speech patterns and outlook on life—and how narrow that is [...] their life is about getting enough money to put food on the table to feed their children, and that&#x27;s it&quot;. She had to wear fat suits and lose about 10-pounds (4½ kg) to showcase her character&#x27;s weight-loss. Burstyn and her co-stars Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, and Marlon Wayans, found the filming schedule of forty days challenging and intense. &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival and was released to theaters on October 6, 2000. The film was well received and praised for its visual style and depiction of drug abuse. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writes, &quot;Burstyn gives an award-caliber performance that is as raw and riveting as the movie that contains it&quot;. Burstyn&#x27;s performance earned her a fifth nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.
From 2000 to 2002, Burstyn starred in the CBS television series &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;. The series, set in suburban New Jersey, ran for two seasons. Burstyn appeared in several more films, including &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; (2002), &quot;Brush with Fate&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; (2004). Burstyn starred in the Broadway production of Martin Tahse&#x27;s &quot;Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All&quot;, based upon the novel of the same title by Allan Gurganus. The show played 19 previews and officially opened November 17, 2003. Due to unfavorable reviews, all performances after the opening night were cancelled.

She provided a supporting role as the mother of two sons in the 2006 romantic drama &quot;The Elephant King&quot;. The film originally premiered at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival, and opened in U.S. theaters October 2008. In January 2006, she starred as an Episcopal bishop in the NBC comedy-drama series &quot;The Book of Daniel&quot;. The series, which also starred Aidan Quinn as a drug-addicted Episcopal priest married to an alcoholic wife, was met with controversy from religious and spiritual leaders due to its unconventional portrayals of religious figures. Conservative groups including American Family Association and Focus on the Family urged supporters to complain to NBC affiliates that carried the show. NBC removed the series from its line-up after four episodes, but did not publicly provide a reason.
In 2006, Burstyn appeared in the epic drama &quot;The Fountain&quot;, her second collaboration with Darren Aronofsky. Portraying Dr. Lillian Guzetti, the film is about a scientist (played by Hugh Jackman) struggling with mortality and is seeking a medical breakthrough to save his wife (Rachel Weisz) from cancer. Budgeted at $35 million, the screenplay is a blend of fantasy, history, spirituality, and science fiction. &quot;The Fountain&quot; premiered on November 22, 2006, to mixed reviews and under-performed at the box office. Ruthe Stein of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; writes, &quot;The movie is overloaded with imagery. At times, it&#x27;s stunning to look at, but gradually becomes too much&quot;, but praises Burstyn for her character&#x27;s &quot;impressive depth&quot;. Since its release, the film managed to gain a cult following causing media to revisit the film.
In 2006, Burstyn was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie for the role of Former Tarnower Steady in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Harris&quot;, another biopic about Jean Harris. Soon after the nominations were announced, questions were raised regarding the worthiness of the nomination due to her minor role in the film, consisting of 14 seconds of screen time and 38 words of dialogue. The nominating committee were accused of approving a &quot;familiar&quot; name without actually seeing their performance. The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, administrator of the Emmy Awards, insisted it was a legitimate nomination. Burstyn reacted, &quot;I thought it was fabulous. My next ambition is to get nominated for seven seconds, and ultimately, I want to be nominated for a picture in which I don&#x27;t even appear&quot;, adding, &quot;This doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with me... work it out yourself&quot;. Ultimately, Kelly Macdonald, who starred in &quot;The Girl in the Cafe&quot;, won the award. In March 2007, the academy adjusted the eligibility criteria.

Burstyn also appeared in the thriller &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (2006), a remake of the 1973 British film of the same name, which was a commercial flop and negatively received by critics. &quot;Slant&quot; magazine was critical of the cast performances, writing that Burstyn &quot;feigns arrogant malevolence&quot;. A year later, Burstyn starred in &quot;The Stone Angel&quot;, based on the 1964 novel of the same name by Margaret Laurence. Like its predecessor, the film also garnered negative reviews, with Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing, &quot;a film of tightly assembled bits and pieces that don&#x27;t fit comfortably together despite clever dashes of magical realism connecting past and present... it leaves you frustrated by its failure to braid subplots and characters into a gripping narrative&quot;. Burstyn followed up with parts in &quot;Lovely, Still&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond&quot; (2008).

In addition to film roles, between 2007 and 2011, Burstyn had an occasional recurring role on the HBO television drama series &quot;Big Love&quot;, playing the mother of polygamist wife Barbara Henrickson. Burstyn returned to the stage in March 2008, in the off-Broadway production of Stephen Adly Guirgis&#x27;s &quot;The Little Flower of East Orange&quot;, directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman in a co-production by LAByrinth Theater Company and The Public Theater. In addition to her stage work, Burstyn portrayed former First Lady Barbara Bush in Oliver Stone&#x27;s biographical film &quot;W.&quot; in 2008.

In 2009, Burstyn won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of the bipolar estranged mother of Detective Elliot Stabler on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;.

=== 2010–present ===
Throughout the early 2010s, Burstyn starred in various independent films such as &quot;Main Street&quot; (2010), &quot;Another Happy Day&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Mighty Macs&quot; (2011). In 2012, she joined the cast of &quot;Political Animals,&quot; a television series about the life of a divorced former First Lady, serving as Secretary of State. &quot;Political Animals&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics according to Metacritic. The series was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film, with Burstyn winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.

Burstyn portrayed the grandmother of Lou (played by Mackenzie Foy) in &quot;Wish You Well&quot; (2013). A year later, Burstyn and Foy worked together again in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s epic science fiction film &quot;Interstellar&quot;. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. The film grossed over $700 million at the box-office.

In 2014, Burstyn made a guest appearance in five episodes of Louis C.K&#x27;s critically acclaimed FX series &quot;Louie&quot;. She portrayed an elderly Hungarian neighbor of Louis C.K. in season four. Critic Emily Todd VanDerWerff of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described Burstyn&#x27;s performance as &quot;marvelous&quot;. Despite not receiving an Emmy nomination, she garnered awards buzz for her performance. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Burstyn was asked about her reaction to the accusations of sexual misconduct against Louis C.K. She responded by saying, &quot;Louis just broke my heart because I love him. When I worked with him, I had such admiration for his talent and his person, his being. I know he&#x27;s a good person, but even good people have sexual hang-ups that hurt other people. I just wish he had gone to therapy or whatever so it didn&#x27;t have to ruin his life.&quot;

In 2014, she also starred in a thriller&quot;, The Calling,&quot; and the television film &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;. In 2015, Burstyn played Flemming, the daughter of Blake Lively&#x27;s immortal character in the romantic fantasy film &quot;The Age of Adaline&quot;. Production started in March 2014, and the film was released in April 2015.

In 2016, Burstyn guest starred in five episodes of the critically acclaimed political thriller &quot;House of Cards&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Burstyn&#x27;s character for adding &quot;vitality and heart&quot;; her performance in the series earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. She acted in a succession of low-budget films, including &quot;Custody&quot; (2016), &quot;The House of Tomorrow&quot; (2017), &quot;All I Wish&quot; (2017), and &quot;Nostalgia&quot; (2018). Burstyn also starred in Jennifer Fox&#x27;s mystery drama &quot;The Tale&quot;, which premiered on HBO on May 26, 2018. Burstyn served as an executive producer for Peter Livolsi&#x27;s film &quot;The House of Tomorrow&quot; (2017)&quot;,&quot; about her friend R. Buckminster Fuller, in which she also starred. In 2019, she appeared in the drama film &quot;American Woman&quot; and the space drama &quot;Lucy in the Sky&quot;; both films were met with mixed reviews.

In 2019, Burstyn played musicologist Katherine Brandt in an acclaimed Australian production of Moisés Kaufman&#x27;s play &quot;33 Variations&quot; at Melbourne&#x27;s Comedy Theatre. In 2020, Burstyn appeared in Kornél Mundruczó&#x27;s drama &quot;Pieces of a Woman&quot; to great acclaim. The film premiered at the 77th Venice International Film Festival, where it received positive reviews for the performances, with critic David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; describing Burstyn&#x27;s performance as &quot;formidable&quot;. She received several award nominations for her performance, including a Broadcast Film Critics Association Award and a London Critics Circle Film Award. In 2021, she played the role of Bernadette Stabler in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime&quot; and then portrayed Sara Roosevelt in the series &quot;The First Lady&quot;.

In 2014, Burstyn indicated she was working on directing a feature film, &quot;Bathing Flo&quot;. It was announced in July 2021 that Burstyn would reprise her role as Chris MacNeil for the first time since 1973 in the upcoming trilogy of sequels to &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.

In 2024 Ellen Burstyn starred in filmmaker John Larkin&#x27;s &quot;Exorcist&quot; Documentary, &quot;Fear and Love: The Story of&quot; The Exorcist, where she discussed her time working on the original film and her spiritual beliefs on God and the universe. She also discussed her reasoning for returning to play Chris MacNeil in &quot;The Exorcist: Believer&quot;.

==Personal life==
Burstyn married Bill Alexander in 1950 and divorced in 1957. The next year, she married Paul Roberts, with whom she adopted a son named Jefferson in 1961. The couple divorced that same year. In 1964, she married actor Neil Nephew, who later changed his name to Neil Burstyn. She described Neil Burstyn as &quot;charming and funny and bright and talented and eccentric&quot;, but schizophrenia made him violent and he eventually left her. He attempted to reconcile but they divorced in 1972. In her autobiography, &quot;Lessons in Becoming Myself&quot;, Burstyn revealed that he had stalked her for six years after their divorce, and once raped her while they were still married. No charges were filed, as spousal rape was not yet a crime. He committed suicide in 1978 by jumping from the window of his ninth-floor Manhattan apartment.

Burstyn was raised Catholic, but now affiliates herself with all religious faiths. She follows a form of Sufism, explaining &quot;I am a spirit opening to the truth that lives in all of these religions... I always pray to Spirit, but sometimes, it&#x27;s to the Goddess. Sometimes, it&#x27;s to Jesus... Sometimes, I pray to Ganesha if I need an obstacle removed. Guan Yin is one of my favorite manifestations of the divine, the embodiment of compassion... So, I have Guan Yin with me all the time.&quot; In her late 30s she began to learn about spirituality, under the instruction of Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan, who gave her the spiritual name Hadiya, which means &quot;she who is guided&quot; in Arabic.

During the 1970s, Burstyn was active in the movement to free convicted boxer Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter from jail. She is a supporter of the Democratic Party, and appeared in the 2009 documentary &quot;PoliWood&quot;. She served as president of the Actors&#x27; Equity Association from 1982 to 1985. Burstyn is also on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service. In 1997, she was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Since 2000, she has been co-president of the Actors Studio alongside Al Pacino and Alec Baldwin. In 2013, she was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame for her work on stage.

==Acting credits==
== Awards and nominations ==
Burstyn is one of the few living actors to have won the Triple Crown of Acting which is the Oscar, Emmy, and Tony. She won the Academy Award in 1975 for her performance in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;. In the same year, she won the Tony Award for &quot;Same Time, Next Year&quot;. (She would reprise her role in the film version in 1978.) Burstyn completed the triple crown more than 30 years later, with a Primetime Emmy Award for her guest starring role on &quot;Law and Order: SVU&quot; (2009).

<text>In abstract algebra, alternativity is a property of a binary operation. A magma is said to be &#x27; if formula_1 for all formula_2 and &#x27; if formula_3 for all formula_2. A magma that is both left and right alternative is said to be &#x27; (&#x27;).

Any associative magma (that is, a semigroup) is alternative. More generally, a magma in which every pair of elements generates an associative submagma must be alternative. The converse, however, is not true, in contrast to the situation in alternative algebras.

==Examples==
Examples of alternative algebras include:
* Any Semigroup is associative and therefor alternative.
* Moufang loops are alternative and flexible but not associative. See for more examples.
* Octonion multiplication is alternative and flexible.
** More generally Cayley-Dickson algebra over a commutative ring is alternative.

<text>In the United States, pigs in a blanket are small hot dogs or other sausages individually wrapped in pastry. It is commonly served as an appetizer.

They are distinct from the British dish of pigs in blankets, where the sausages are instead wrapped in bacon.

== Ingredients and preparation ==
In the United States the term &quot;pigs in a blanket&quot; typically refers to hot dogs in croissant dough, but may include Vienna sausages, cocktail or breakfast/link sausages baked inside biscuit dough or croissant dough. American cookbooks from the 1800s have recipes for &quot;little pigs in blankets&quot;, but this is a rather different dish of oysters rolled in bacon similar to angels on horseback. The modern version can be traced back to at least 1940, when a U.S. Army cookbook lists &quot;Pork Sausage Links (Pigs) in Blankets&quot;.

The dough is sometimes homemade, but canned dough is most common. Pancake dough is also sometimes used, although this combination is more commonly served like a corn dog and sold as a pancake on a stick. The larger variety is served as a quick and easy main course or a light meal (particularly for children) at lunch or supper while the smaller version is served as an appetizer. In Texas, kolaches or klobasneks are a similar dish which originates from Czech immigrants. The meat or savory part, often a sausage but not always, is wrapped in kolache dough and not croissant dough. This dish in Texas is most commonly referred to as &quot;kolache&quot;, although traditional Czech-style kolaches are a sweet dish, not a savory dish.

== Serving ==

Smaller versions of the dish are commonly served as an appetizer or hors d&#x27;oeuvre, sometimes with a mustard or aioli dipping sauce, or are accompanied by other foods during the main course.

==Similar dishes==

The cuisines of a number of countries have similar dishes under a variety of names.

In Belgium, this is a traditional dish from the city of Namur, where it is called &quot;avisance&quot;. Historically it was a sausage or sausage meat in bread dough, replaced nowadays with puff pastry.

In Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, a hot dog wrapped in bread is called a &quot;fransk hot dog&quot; (). The name is a reference to the bread&#x27;s similarity to a baguette. In Denmark and Norway, American-style pigs in a blanket are known as , meaning &quot;sausage horns&quot;.

The German (&quot;sausage in a dressing gown&quot;) uses sausages wrapped in puff pastry or, more rarely, pancakes. Cheese and bacon are sometimes present.

In the Netherlands, is a puff pastry roll filled with seasoned minced meat.

In the United Kingdom and Australia, pastry-wrapped sausage meat is known as a sausage roll.

<doc id="186057" wikidata="Q2634405" url="?curid=186057" title="Quaternions and spatial rotation">
<text>Unit quaternions, known as &quot;versors&quot;, provide a convenient mathematical notation for representing spatial orientations and rotations of elements in three dimensional space. Specifically, they encode information about an axis-angle rotation about an arbitrary axis. Rotation and orientation quaternions have applications in computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, navigation, molecular dynamics, flight dynamics, orbital mechanics of satellites, and crystallographic texture analysis.

When used to represent rotation, unit quaternions are also called rotation quaternions as they represent the 3D rotation group. When used to represent an orientation (rotation relative to a reference coordinate system), they are called orientation quaternions or attitude quaternions. A spatial rotation around a fixed point of formula_1 radians about a unit axis formula_2 that denotes the &quot;Euler axis&quot; is given by the quaternion formula_3, where formula_4 and formula_5.

Compared to rotation matrices, quaternions are more compact, efficient, and numerically stable. Compared to Euler angles, they are simpler to compose. However, they are not as intuitive and easy to understand and, due to the periodic nature of sine and cosine, rotation angles differing precisely by the natural period will be encoded into identical quaternions and recovered angles in radians will be limited to formula_6.

== Using quaternions as rotations ==

In 3-dimensional space, according to Euler&#x27;s rotation theorem, any rotation or sequence of rotations of a rigid body or coordinate system about a fixed point is equivalent to a single rotation by a given angle formula_1 about a fixed axis (called the &quot;Euler axis&quot;) that runs through the fixed point. The Euler axis is typically represented by a unit vector formula_8 (formula_9 in the picture). Therefore, any rotation in three dimensions can be represented as a vector formula_8 and an angle formula_1.

Quaternions give a simple way to encode this axis–angle representation using four real numbers, and can be used to apply (calculate) the corresponding rotation to a position vector , representing a point relative to the origin in R3.

Euclidean vectors such as or can be rewritten as or , where , , are unit vectors representing the three Cartesian axes (traditionally , , ), and also obey the multiplication rules of the fundamental quaternion units by interpreting the Euclidean vector as the vector part of the pure quaternion .

A rotation of angle formula_1 around the axis defined by the unit vector
: formula_13
can be represented by conjugation by a unit quaternion . Since the quaternion product formula_14 gives 1, using the Taylor series of the exponential function, the extension of Euler&#x27;s formula results:

: formula_15

It can be shown that the desired rotation can be applied to an ordinary vector formula_16 in 3-dimensional space, considered as the vector part of the pure quaternion formula_17, by evaluating the conjugation of  by , given by:
: formula_18
: formula_19

using the Hamilton product, where the vector part of the pure quaternion is the new position vector of the point after the rotation. In a programmatic implementation, the conjugation is achieved by constructing a pure quaternion whose vector part is , and then performing the quaternion conjugation. The vector part of the resulting pure quaternion is the desired vector . Clearly, formula_20 provides a linear transformation of the quaternion space to itself; also, since formula_21 is unitary, the transformation is an isometry. Also, formula_22 and so formula_20 leaves vectors parallel to formula_24 invariant. So, by decomposing formula_25 as a vector parallel to the vector part formula_26 of formula_21 and a vector normal to the vector part of formula_21 and showing that the application of formula_20 to the normal component of formula_30 rotates it, the claim is shown. So let formula_31 be the component of formula_32 orthogonal to the vector part of formula_24 and let formula_34. It turns out that the vector part of formula_35 is given by 
:formula_36.
The conjugation of by can be expressed with fewer arithmetic operations as:
: formula_37

A geometric fact independent of quaternions is the existence of a two-to-one mapping from physical rotations to rotational transformation matrices. If 0 ⩽ formula_1 ⩽ formula_39, a physical rotation about formula_8 by formula_1 and a physical rotation about formula_42 by formula_43 both achieve the same final orientation by disjoint paths through intermediate orientations. By inserting those vectors and angles into the formula for above, one finds that if represents the first rotation, represents the second rotation. This is a geometric proof that conjugation by and by must produce the same rotational transformation matrix. That fact is confirmed algebraically by noting that the conjugation is quadratic in , so the sign of cancels, and does not affect the result. (See 2:1 mapping of SU(2) to SO(3)) If both rotations are a half-turn formula_44, both and will have a real coordinate equal to zero. Otherwise, one will have a positive real part, representing a rotation by an angle less than formula_45, and the other will have a negative real part, representing a rotation by an angle greater than formula_45.

Mathematically, this operation carries the &quot;set&quot; of all &quot;pure&quot; quaternions (those with real part equal to zero)—which constitute a 3-dimensional space among the quaternions—into itself, by the desired rotation about the axis u, by the angle θ. (Each real quaternion is carried into itself by this operation. But for the purpose of rotations in 3-dimensional space, we ignore the real quaternions.)

The rotation is clockwise if our line of sight points in the same direction as formula_8.

In this (which?) instance, is a unit quaternion and
: formula_48

It follows that conjugation by the product of two quaternions is the composition of conjugations by these quaternions: If and are unit quaternions, then rotation (conjugation) by  is
:formula_49,
which is the same as rotating (conjugating) by  and then by . The scalar component of the result is necessarily zero.

The quaternion inverse of a rotation is the opposite rotation, since formula_50. The square of a quaternion rotation is a rotation by twice the angle around the same axis. More generally is a rotation by  times the angle around the same axis as . This can be extended to arbitrary real , allowing for smooth interpolation between spatial orientations; see Slerp.

Two rotation quaternions can be combined into one equivalent quaternion by the relation:

: formula_51

in which corresponds to the rotation followed by the rotation . Thus, an arbitrary number of rotations can be composed together and then applied as a single rotation. (Note that quaternion multiplication is not commutative.)

=== Example conjugation operation ===

&quot;Conjugating&quot; &quot;by&quot; refers to the operation .

Consider the rotation around the axis formula_52, with a rotation angle of 120°, or  radians. 

:formula_53
The length of formula_54 is , the half angle is (60°) with cosine , () and sine , (). We are therefore dealing with a conjugation by the unit quaternion

:formula_55

If is the rotation function,
:formula_56

It can be proven that the inverse of a unit quaternion is obtained simply by changing the sign of its imaginary components. As a consequence,
:formula_57
and
:formula_58

This can be simplified, using the ordinary rules for quaternion arithmetic, to
:formula_59

As expected, the rotation corresponds to keeping a cube held fixed at one point, and rotating it 120° about the long diagonal through the fixed point (observe how the three axes are permuted cyclically).

=== Quaternion-derived rotation matrix ===
A quaternion rotation formula_60 (with formula_61) can be algebraically manipulated into a matrix rotation formula_62, where formula_63 is the rotation matrix given by:

: formula_64

Here formula_65 and if is a unit quaternion, formula_66.

This can be obtained by using vector calculus and linear algebra if we express formula_32 and formula_24 as scalar and vector parts and use the formula for the multiplication operation in the equation formula_60. If we write formula_32 as formula_71, formula_72 as formula_73 and formula_24 as formula_75, where formula_76, our equation turns into formula_77. By using the formula for multiplication of two quaternions that are expressed as scalar and vector parts,

:formula_78

this equation can be rewritten as

:formula_79

where formula_80 denotes the outer product, formula_81 is the identity matrix and formula_82 is the transformation matrix that when multiplied from the right with a vector formula_83 gives the cross product formula_84.

Since formula_85, we can identify formula_63 as formula_87, which upon expansion should result in the expression written in matrix form above.

=== Recovering the axis-angle representation ===

The expression formula_88 rotates any vector quaternion formula_89 around an axis given by the vector formula_90 by the angle formula_1, where formula_90 and formula_1 depends on the quaternion formula_61.

formula_90 and formula_1 can be found from the following equations:

:formula_97

where formula_98 is the two-argument arctangent. While formula_99 works, it is numerically unstable (inaccurate) near formula_100 for numbers with finite precision.

Care should be taken when the quaternion approaches a scalar, since due to degeneracy the axis of an identity rotation is not well-defined.

===The composition of spatial rotations===
A benefit of the quaternion formulation of the composition of two rotations &quot;R&quot;B and &quot;R&quot;A is that it yields directly the rotation axis and angle of the composite rotation &quot;R&quot;C = &quot;R&quot;B&quot;R&quot;A.

Let the quaternion associated with a spatial rotation &quot;R&quot; be constructed from its rotation axis S with the rotation angle formula_101 around this axis. The associated quaternion is given by
formula_102
Then the composition of the rotation &quot;R&quot;B with &quot;R&quot;A is the rotation &quot;R&quot;C = &quot;R&quot;B&quot;R&quot;A with rotation axis and angle defined by the product of the quaternions
formula_103
that is
formula_104

Expand this product to obtain
formula_105

Divide both sides of this equation by the identity, which is the law of cosines on a sphere,
formula_106
and compute
formula_107

This is Rodrigues&#x27; formula for the axis of a composite rotation defined in terms of the axes of the two rotations. He derived this formula in 1840 (see page 408).

The three rotation axes A, B, and C form a spherical triangle and the dihedral angles between the planes formed by the sides of this triangle are defined by the rotation angles. Hamilton presented the component form of these equations showing that the quaternion product computes the third vertex of a spherical triangle from two given vertices and their associated arc-lengths, which is also defines an algebra for points in Elliptic geometry.

====Axis–angle composition====

The normalized rotation axis, removing the formula_108 from the expanded product, leaves the vector which is the rotation axis, times some constant. Care should be taken normalizing the axis vector when formula_109 is formula_110 or formula_111 where the vector is near formula_110; which is identity, or 0 rotation around any axis.

formula_113

Or with angle addition trigonometric substitutions...
formula_114

finally normalizing the rotation axis: formula_115 or formula_116.

=== Differentiation with respect to the rotation quaternion ===

The rotated quaternion needs to be differentiated with respect to the rotating quaternion , when the rotation is estimated from numerical optimization. The estimation of rotation angle is an essential procedure in 3D object registration or camera calibration. For unitary and pure imaginary , that is for a rotation in 3D space, the derivatives of the rotated quaternion can be represented using matrix calculus notation as
:formula_117

A derivation can be found in.

== Background ==

===Quaternions===
The complex numbers can be defined by introducing an abstract symbol which satisfies the usual rules of algebra and additionally the rule . This is sufficient to reproduce all of the rules of complex number arithmetic: for example:
: formula_118

In the same way the quaternions can be defined by introducing abstract symbols , , which satisfy the rules and the usual algebraic rules &quot;except&quot; the commutative law of multiplication (a familiar example of such a noncommutative multiplication is matrix multiplication). From this all of the rules of quaternion arithmetic follow, such as the rules on multiplication of quaternion basis elements. Using these rules, one can show that:
: formula_119

The imaginary part formula_120 of a quaternion behaves like a vector formula_121 in three-dimensional vector space, and the real part behaves like a scalar in . When quaternions are used in geometry, it is more convenient to define them as a scalar plus a vector:

: formula_122

Some might find it strange to add a &quot;number&quot; to a &quot;vector&quot;, as they are objects of very different natures, or to &quot;multiply&quot; two vectors together, as this operation is usually undefined. However, if one remembers that it is a mere notation for the real and imaginary parts of a quaternion, it becomes more legitimate. In other words, the correct reasoning is the addition of two quaternions, one with zero vector/imaginary part, and another one with zero scalar/real part:
:formula_123

We can express quaternion multiplication in the modern language of vector cross and dot products (which were actually inspired by the quaternions in the first place). When multiplying the vector/imaginary parts, in place of the rules we have the quaternion multiplication rule:
: formula_124
where:
* formula_125 is the resulting quaternion,
* formula_126 is vector cross product (a vector),
* formula_127 is vector scalar product (a scalar).

Quaternion multiplication is noncommutative (because of the cross product, which anti-commutes), while scalar–scalar and scalar–vector multiplications commute. From these rules it follows immediately that (see ):

:formula_128

The (left and right) multiplicative inverse or reciprocal of a nonzero quaternion is given by the conjugate-to-norm ratio (see details):

:formula_129

as can be verified by direct calculation (note the similarity to the multiplicative inverse of complex numbers).

===Rotation identity===

Let formula_8 be a unit vector (the rotation axis) and let formula_131. Our goal is to show that
:formula_132
yields the vector formula_54 rotated by an angle formula_134 around the axis formula_8. Expanding out (and bearing in mind that formula_136), we have

:formula_137

If we let formula_138 and formula_139 equal the components of formula_54 perpendicular and parallel to formula_8 respectively, then formula_142 and formula_143, leading to

:formula_144

Using the trigonometric pythagorean and double-angle identities, we then have
:formula_145

This is the formula of a rotation by formula_134 around the axis.

== Quaternion rotation operations ==

A very formal explanation of the properties used in this section is given by Altman.

===The hypersphere of rotations===
====Visualizing the space of rotations====
Unit quaternions represent the group of Euclidean rotations in three dimensions in a very straightforward way. The correspondence between rotations and quaternions can be understood by first visualizing the space of rotations itself.

In order to visualize the space of rotations, it helps to consider a simpler case. Any rotation in three dimensions can be described by a rotation by some angle about some axis; for our purposes, we will use an axis &quot;vector&quot; to establish handedness for our angle. Consider the special case in which the axis of rotation lies in the &quot;xy&quot; plane. We can then specify the axis of one of these rotations by a point on a circle through which the vector crosses, and we can select the radius of the circle to denote the angle of rotation.

Similarly, a rotation whose axis of rotation lies in the &quot;xy&quot; plane can be described as a point on a sphere of &quot;fixed&quot; radius in &quot;three&quot; dimensions. Beginning at the north pole of a sphere in three-dimensional space, we specify the point at the north pole to be the identity rotation (a zero angle rotation). Just as in the case of the identity rotation, no axis of rotation is defined, and the angle of rotation (zero) is irrelevant. A rotation having a very small rotation angle can be specified by a slice through the sphere parallel to the &quot;xy&quot; plane and very near the north pole. The circle defined by this slice will be very small, corresponding to the small angle of the rotation. As the rotation angles become larger, the slice moves in the negative &quot;z&quot; direction, and the circles become larger until the equator of the sphere is reached, which will correspond to a rotation angle of 180 degrees. Continuing southward, the radii of the circles now become smaller (corresponding to the absolute value of the angle of the rotation considered as a negative number). Finally, as the south pole is reached, the circles shrink once more to the identity rotation, which is also specified as the point at the south pole.

Notice that a number of characteristics of such rotations and their representations can be seen by this visualization. The space of rotations is continuous, each rotation has a neighborhood of rotations which are nearly the same, and this neighborhood becomes flat as the neighborhood shrinks. Also, each rotation is actually represented by two antipodal points on the sphere, which are at opposite ends of a line through the center of the sphere. This reflects the fact that each rotation can be represented as a rotation about some axis, or, equivalently, as a negative rotation about an axis pointing in the opposite direction (a so-called double cover). The &quot;latitude&quot; of a circle representing a particular rotation angle will be half of the angle represented by that rotation, since as the point is moved from the north to south pole, the latitude ranges from zero to 180 degrees, while the angle of rotation ranges from 0 to 360 degrees. (the &quot;longitude&quot; of a point then represents a particular axis of rotation.) Note however that this set of rotations is not closed under composition. Two successive rotations with axes in the &quot;xy&quot; plane will not necessarily give a rotation whose axis lies in the &quot;xy&quot; plane, and thus cannot be represented as a point on the sphere. This will not be the case with a general rotation in 3-space, in which rotations do form a closed set under composition.

This visualization can be extended to a general rotation in 3-dimensional space. The identity rotation is a point, and a small angle of rotation about some axis can be represented as a point on a sphere with a small radius. As the angle of rotation grows, the sphere grows, until the angle of rotation reaches 180 degrees, at which point the sphere begins to shrink, becoming a point as the angle approaches 360 degrees (or zero degrees from the negative direction). This set of expanding and contracting spheres represents a hypersphere in four dimensional space (a 3-sphere). Just as in the simpler example above, each rotation represented as a point on the hypersphere is matched by its antipodal point on that hypersphere. The &quot;latitude&quot; on the hypersphere will be half of the corresponding angle of rotation, and the neighborhood of any point will become &quot;flatter&quot; (i.e. be represented by a 3-D Euclidean space of points) as the neighborhood shrinks. This behavior is matched by the set of unit quaternions: A general quaternion represents a point in a four dimensional space, but constraining it to have unit magnitude yields a three-dimensional space equivalent to the surface of a hypersphere. The magnitude of the unit quaternion will be unity, corresponding to a hypersphere of unit radius. The vector part of a unit quaternion represents the radius of the 2-sphere corresponding to the axis of rotation, and its magnitude is the sine of half the angle of rotation. Each rotation is represented by two unit quaternions of opposite sign, and, as in the space of rotations in three dimensions, the quaternion product of two unit quaternions will yield a unit quaternion. Also, the space of unit quaternions is &quot;flat&quot; in any infinitesimal neighborhood of a given unit quaternion.

====Parameterizing the space of rotations====
We can parameterize the surface of a sphere with two coordinates, such as latitude and longitude. But latitude and longitude are ill-behaved (degenerate as described by the hairy ball theorem) at the north and south poles, though the poles are not intrinsically different from any other points on the sphere. At the poles (latitudes +90° and −90°), the longitude becomes meaningless.

It can be shown that no two-parameter coordinate system can avoid such degeneracy. We can avoid such problems by embedding the sphere in three-dimensional space and parameterizing it with three Cartesian coordinates , placing the north pole at , the south pole at , and the equator at , . Points on the sphere satisfy the constraint , so we still have just two degrees of freedom though there are three coordinates. A point on the sphere represents a rotation in the ordinary space around the horizontal axis directed by the vector by an angle formula_147.

In the same way the hyperspherical space of 3D rotations can be parameterized by three angles (Euler angles), but any such parameterization is degenerate at some points on the hypersphere, leading to the problem of gimbal lock. We can avoid this by using four Euclidean coordinates , with . The point represents a rotation around the axis directed by the vector by an angle formula_148

== Explaining quaternions&#x27; properties with rotations ==

=== Non-commutativity ===

The multiplication of quaternions is non-commutative. This fact explains how the formula can work at all, having by definition. Since the multiplication of unit quaternions corresponds to the composition of three-dimensional rotations, this property can be made intuitive by showing that three-dimensional rotations are not commutative in general.

The figure to the right illustrates this with dice. Use your right hand to create a pair of 90 degree rotations. Both dice are initially configured as shown in the upper left-hand corner (with 1 dot on the top face.) Path A begins with a rotation about the &quot;–y&quot; axis (using the right-hand rule.), followed by a rotation about the &quot;+z&quot; axis, resulting in the configuration shown in the lower left corner (5 dots on the top face.) Path B reverses the order of operations, resulting with 3 dots on top.

If you don&#x27;t have dice, set two books next to each other. Rotate one of them 90 degrees clockwise around the &quot;z&quot; axis, then flip it 180 degrees around the &quot;x&quot; axis. Take the other book, flip it 180° around &quot;x&quot; axis first, and 90° clockwise around &quot;z&quot; later. The two books do not end up parallel. This shows that, in general, the composition of two different rotations around two distinct spatial axes will not commute.

=== Orientation ===

The vector cross product, used to define the axis–angle representation, does confer an orientation (&quot;handedness&quot;) to space: in a three-dimensional vector space, the three vectors in the equation will always form a right-handed set (or a left-handed set, depending on how the cross product is defined), thus fixing an orientation in the vector space. Alternatively, the dependence on orientation is expressed in referring to such formula_8 that specifies a rotation as to &quot;axial vectors&quot;. In quaternionic formalism the choice of an orientation of the space corresponds to order of multiplication: but . If one reverses the orientation, then the formula above becomes , i.e., a unit is replaced with the conjugate quaternion – the same behaviour as of axial vectors.

== Alternative conventions ==

It is reported that the existence and continued usage of an alternative quaternion convention in the aerospace and, to a lesser extent, robotics community is incurring a &quot;significant and ongoing cost&quot;. This alternative convention is proposed by Shuster M.D. in and departs from tradition by reversing the definition for multiplying quaternion basis elements such that under Shuster&#x27;s convention, formula_150 whereas Hamilton&#x27;s definition is formula_151. This convention is also referred to as &quot;JPL convention&quot; for its use in some parts of NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Under Shuster&#x27;s convention, the formula for multiplying two quaternions is altered such that
:formula_152

The formula for rotating a vector by a quaternion is altered to be
:formula_153
To identify the changes under Shuster&#x27;s convention, see that the sign before the cross product is flipped from plus to minus.

Finally, the formula for converting a quaternion to a rotation matrix is altered to be
:formula_154
which is exactly the transpose of the rotation matrix converted under the traditional convention.

=== Software applications by convention used ===
The table below groups applications by their adherence to either quaternion convention:
While use of either convention does not impact the capability or correctness of applications thus created, the authors of argued that the Shuster convention should be abandoned because it departs from the much older quaternion multiplication convention by Hamilton and may never be adopted by the mathematical or theoretical physics areas.

== Comparison with other representations of rotations ==

=== Advantages of quaternions ===

The representation of a rotation as a quaternion (4 numbers) is more compact than the representation as an orthogonal matrix (9 numbers). Furthermore, for a given axis and angle, one can easily construct the corresponding quaternion, and conversely, for a given quaternion one can easily read off the axis and the angle. Both of these are much harder with matrices or Euler angles.

In video games and other applications, one is often interested in &quot;smooth rotations&quot;, meaning that the scene should slowly rotate and not in a single step. This can be accomplished by choosing a curve such as the spherical linear interpolation in the quaternions, with one endpoint being the identity transformation 1 (or some other initial rotation) and the other being the intended final rotation. This is more problematic with other representations of rotations.

When composing several rotations on a computer, rounding errors necessarily accumulate. A quaternion that is slightly off still represents a rotation after being normalized: a matrix that is slightly off may not be orthogonal any more and is harder to convert back to a proper orthogonal matrix.

Quaternions also avoid a phenomenon called gimbal lock which can result when, for example in pitch/yaw/roll rotational systems, the pitch is rotated 90° up or down, so that yaw and roll then correspond to the same motion, and a degree of freedom of rotation is lost. In a gimbal-based aerospace inertial navigation system, for instance, this could have disastrous results if the aircraft is in a steep dive or ascent.

=== Conversion to and from the matrix representation ===

==== From a quaternion to an orthogonal matrix ====

The orthogonal matrix corresponding to a rotation by the unit quaternion (with ) when post-multiplying with a column vector is given by
:formula_155

This rotation matrix is used on vector as formula_156. The quaternion representation of this rotation is given by:
:formula_157

where formula_158 is the conjugate of the quaternion formula_159, given by formula_160

Also, quaternion multiplication is defined as (assuming &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are quaternions, like &quot;z&quot; above):

formula_161

where the order &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; is important since the cross product of two vectors is not commutative.

A more efficient calculation in which the quaternion does not need to be unit normalized is given by
:formula_162
where the following intermediate quantities have been defined:
:formula_163

==== From an orthogonal matrix to a quaternion ====
One must be careful when converting a rotation matrix to a quaternion, as several straightforward methods tend to be unstable when the trace (sum of the diagonal elements) of the rotation matrix is zero or very small. For a stable method of converting an orthogonal matrix to a quaternion, see the Rotation matrix#Quaternion.

==== Fitting quaternions ====
The above section described how to recover a quaternion from a rotation matrix . Suppose, however, that we have some matrix that is not a pure rotation—due to round-off errors, for example—and we wish to find the quaternion that most accurately represents . In that case we construct a symmetric matrix
:formula_164
and find the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue (that value will be 1 if and only if is a pure rotation). The quaternion so obtained will correspond to the rotation closest to the original matrix .

=== Performance comparisons ===
This section discusses the performance implications of using quaternions versus other methods (axis/angle or rotation matrices) to perform rotations in 3D.

==== Results ====

Only three of the quaternion components are independent, as a rotation is represented by a unit quaternion. For further calculation one usually needs all four elements, so all calculations would suffer additional expense from recovering the fourth component. Likewise, angle–axis can be stored in a three-component vector by multiplying the unit direction by the angle (or a function thereof), but this comes at additional computational cost when using it for calculations. Similarly, a rotation matrix requires orthogonal basis vectors, so in 3D space the third vector can unambiguously be calculated from the first two vectors with a cross product (though there is ambiguity in the sign of the third vector if improper rotations are allowed).

* Quaternions can be implicitly converted to a rotation-like matrix (12 multiplications and 12 additions/subtractions), which levels the following vectors rotating cost with the rotation matrix method.

==== Used methods ====

There are three basic approaches to rotating a vector :
# Compute the matrix product of a rotation matrix and the original column matrix representing . This requires 3 × (3 multiplications + 2 additions) = 9 multiplications and 6 additions, the most efficient method for rotating a vector.
# A rotation can be represented by a unit-length quaternion with scalar (real) part and vector (imaginary) part . The rotation can be applied to a 3D vector via the formula formula_165. This requires only 15 multiplications and 15 additions to evaluate (or 18 multiplications and 12 additions if the factor of 2 is done via multiplication.) This formula, originally thought to be used with axis/angle notation (Rodrigues&#x27; formula), can also be applied to quaternion notation. This yields the same result as the less efficient but more compact formula of quaternion multiplication formula_166.
# Use the angle/axis formula to convert an angle/axis to a rotation matrix then multiplying with a vector, or, similarly, use a formula to convert quaternion notation to a rotation matrix, then multiplying with a vector. Converting the angle/axis to costs 12 multiplications, 2 function calls (sin, cos), and 10 additions/subtractions; from item 1, rotating using adds an additional 9 multiplications and 6 additions for a total of 21 multiplications, 16 add/subtractions, and 2 function calls (sin, cos). Converting a quaternion to costs 12 multiplications and 12 additions/subtractions; from item 1, rotating using adds an additional 9 multiplications and 6 additions for a total of 21 multiplications and 18 additions/subtractions.

== Pairs of unit quaternions as rotations in 4D space ==

A pair of unit quaternions formula_167 and formula_168 can represent any rotation in 4D space. Given a four-dimensional vector formula_54, expressed as a quaternion formula_170, we can rotate it as follows:

:formula_171

where the matrices formula_172 and formula_173 represent left and right quaternion multiplications, respectively. Together, these matrices form an isoclinic decomposition of a rotation in formula_174. Since quaternion multiplication is associative, we have:

:formula_175.

Thus, the two matrices formula_172 and formula_173 must commute. This implies the existence of two commuting subgroups within the group of four-dimensional rotations. An arbitrary four-dimensional rotation has six degrees of freedom, with each matrix contributing three of these six degrees of freedom.

Since the generators of the four-dimensional rotations can be represented by pairs of quaternions (as follows), all four-dimensional rotations can also be represented.

:formula_178

<text>In baseball, a perfect game is a game in which one or more pitchers complete a minimum of nine innings with no batter from the opposing team reaching base. To achieve a perfect game, a team must not allow any opposing player to reach base by any means: no hits, walks, hit batsmen, uncaught third strikes, catcher&#x27;s interference, fielder&#x27;s obstruction, or fielding errors which allow a batter to reach base.

A perfect game, by definition, is also a no-hitter, and is also guaranteed to result in a win and a shutout if the game does not go into extra innings. In leagues that use a WBSC tiebreaker (including MLB since 2020), runners are placed on second base, and in some leagues, also on first base at the start of each half-inning during extra innings; this automatic runner would not cause a perfect game to be lost. Therefore, if the runner advances and scores without any batters reaching base (by means of stolen base, sacrifice, fielder&#x27;s choice, etc.), and this turns out to be the winning run, then the losing team will still be credited with a perfect game, despite losing the game. A fielding error that does not allow a batter to reach base, such as a misplayed foul ball, does not spoil a perfect game. Games that last fewer than nine innings, regardless of cause, in which a team has no baserunners do not qualify as perfect games. Games in which a team reaches first base only in extra innings also do not qualify as perfect games.

The first known use of the term &quot;perfect game&quot; was in ; its current definition was formalized in . In Major League Baseball (MLB), it has been achieved 24 times – 22 times since the modern era began in 1901, most recently by Domingo Germán of the New York Yankees on June 28, 2023, against the Oakland Athletics. Although it is possible for two or more pitchers to combine for a perfect game (which has happened 20 times in MLB no-hitters), every MLB perfect game so far has been thrown by a single pitcher. An example of a combined perfect game occurred in Game 5 of the 2007 Japan Series of Nippon Professional Baseball.

==History in Major League Baseball==
The first known occurrence of the term &quot;perfect game&quot; in print was in 1908. I. E. Sanborn&#x27;s report for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; about Addie Joss&#x27;s performance against the White Sox calls it &quot;an absolutely perfect game, without run, without hit, and without letting an opponent reach first base by hook or crook, on hit, walk, or error, in nine innings&quot;. Several sources have claimed that the first recorded usage of &quot;perfect game&quot; was by Ernest J. Lanigan in his &quot;Baseball Cyclopedia&quot;, made in reference to Charlie Robertson&#x27;s 1922 perfect game. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; came close to the term in describing Lee Richmond&#x27;s game for Worcester in 1880: &quot;Richmond was most effectively supported, every position on the home nine being played to perfection.&quot; Similarly, in writing up John Montgomery Ward&#x27;s 1880 perfect game, the &quot;New York Clipper&quot; described the &quot;perfect play&quot; of Providence&#x27;s defense.

There has been one perfect game in the World Series, thrown by Don Larsen for the New York Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers on October 8, 1956. By coincidence, Larsen, and the catcher for that game, Yogi Berra, were in attendance when Yankee pitcher David Cone threw a perfect game in 1999, as Larsen and Berra were invited to throw and catch the ceremonial first pitch.

Ron Hassey is the only catcher in MLB history to have caught more than one perfect game. His first was with pitcher Len Barker (for the Cleveland Indians against the Toronto Blue Jays) in 1981 and his second was with pitcher Dennis Martínez (for the Montreal Expos against the Los Angeles Dodgers) in 1991.

The most recent perfect game for MLB occurred on June 28, 2023, with Domingo Germán of the New York Yankees against the Oakland Athletics in an 11–0 victory, finishing with 9 strikeouts. Germán became the first-ever pitcher born in the Dominican Republic to throw a perfect game in the MLB, as well as the third-ever non-American-born player to do so, and was the first pitcher to throw a perfect game with the pitch clock and batting clock rules in effect.

==Rule definition by MLB==
, the Major League Baseball definition of a perfect game is largely a side effect of the decision made by the major leagues&#x27; Committee for Statistical Accuracy on September 4, 1991, to redefine a no-hitter as a game in which the pitcher or pitchers on one team throw a complete game of nine innings or more without surrendering a hit. That decision removed a number of games that had long appeared in the record books: those lasting fewer than nine innings, and those in which a team went hitless in regulation but then got a hit in extra innings. The definition of perfect game was made to parallel this new definition of the no-hitter, in effect substituting &quot;baserunner&quot; for &quot;hit&quot;. As a result of the 1991 redefinition, for instance, Harvey Haddix does not receive credit for a perfect game or a no-hitter for his performance on May 26, 1959, when he threw 12 perfect innings against the Milwaukee Braves before a batter reached in the 13th.

Since MLB implementation of the softball variant of the WBSC tie-breaker in 2020, the offensive team is awarded a free runner on second base each half-inning during extra innings. This itself would not end a perfect game, even if the runner scores or is erased on a double play. Another rule change effective for two seasons (2020–2021) stipulated that games that are part of doubleheaders last only seven innings. Such a game in which one team did not reach first base would not have been credited as a perfect game (similar to weather-shortened games). However, if such a doubleheader game were to have at least two extra innings and one team still did not reach first base, then the game would have been credited as a perfect game. During those two seasons, no potential perfect games were affected but there were two potential no-hitters affected.

Both rule changes were expected to be reversed prior to the 2022 season, but the international tiebreaker was permanently added to the Official rules of Major League Baseball regular season rules in February 2023. The WBSC tiebreaker is not used in postseason play.

==In other leagues==
The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) existed from 1943 to 1954. Four of its players pitched a perfect game: Annabelle Lee in 1944, Carolyn Morris in 1945, Doris Sams in 1947, and Jean Faut in 1951 (against the Rockford Peaches) and again in 1953 (against the Kalamazoo Lassies). Faut is the only professional baseball player, male or female, to have pitched two perfect games.
In Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the first perfect game was thrown by Hideo Fujimoto of the Giants on June 28, 1950, against the Nishi Nippon Pirates. 16 total have been thrown in NPB, with the most recent perfect game for NPB by Chiba Lotte Marines pitcher Rōki Sasaki on April 10, 2022. Sasaki tied an existing NPB record by striking out 19 batters, and set a new record by striking out 13 consecutive batters. Sasaki compiled a game score of 106, surpassing the 105 for Kerry Wood&#x27;s 20 strikeout game from the 1998 Major League Baseball season, which was the highest MLB game score since the end of the baseball color line. On November 1, 2007, a combined perfect game was thrown by the Chunichi Dragons during Game 5 of the 2007 Japan Series. Starting pitcher Daisuke Yamai pitched eight perfect innings and received the win, with Hitoki Iwase receiving the save; the Dragons&#x27; victory also resulted in them winning the Japan Series. Although NPB does not recognize this as a perfect game due to it not being a complete game, it is recognized as a perfect game by the World Baseball Softball Confederation. This makes it the only perfect game thrown during the Japan Series, and the only combined perfect game in history to span a regulation nine innings.

On August 23, 1957, Ángel Macías (12) from the Monterrey, Mexico, team pitched the only perfect game of the Little League World Series, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Macías struck out 11 out of the 18 batters he faced (Little League games are 6 innings). 

The only perfect game thrown in Chinese Professional Baseball League play was by Ryan Verdugo of the Uni-President Lions on October 7, 2018, against the Chinatrust Brothers, in a game where Kuo Fu-Lin had to hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth to win the game and preserve the perfect game, 1-0. 

Four Puerto Rico pitchers combined for an 8-inning perfect game against Israel in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Starter José De León recorded ten strikeouts in innings, and relievers Yacksel Rios, Edwin Diaz, and Duane Underwood Jr. recorded seven more outs before the game ended early because of the mercy rule. It was ruled to not be an official perfect game by the Elias Sports Bureau as they stipulate that a perfect game must last at least 9 innings. De León responded to this saying &quot;It&#x27;s perfect for us&quot;.

<text>The Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama is a Golden Globe Award that has been awarded annually since 1944 by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA). Since its institution in 1943, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association is an organization of journalists who cover the film industry in the United States, but are affiliated with publications outside North America.

When the awards were introduced, there was a single category for Best Picture. Starting with the 9th Golden Globe Awards, the Golden Globes split the Acting and Best Picture awards into Drama and Musical or Comedy categories. Since 1951, the only time the awards were reunified was in 1953.

This award goes to the producers of the film. In the following lists, the first titles listed are winners. These are also in bold and in blue background; those not in bold are nominees.

The years given are those in which the films under consideration were released, not the year of the ceremony, which always takes place the following year.

== Winners and Nominees ==

=== 1940s ===
=== 1950s ===
=== 1960s ===
=== 1970s ===
=== 1980s ===
=== 1990s ===
=== 2000s ===
=== 2010s ===
=== 2020s ===
== Notes ==

* Following the controversy over the motion picture category omission towards non-English language films, &quot;The Zone of Interest&quot; (United Kingdom) is the first wholly non-English language film to be nominated both Foreign Language and in this category, although &quot;Anatomy of a Fall&quot; (France) is part of non-English language film due to occasional use of English language.

<text>The Golden Globe Award for Best Director – Motion Picture is a Golden Globe Award that has been presented annually by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, an organization composed of journalists who cover the United States film industry for publications based outside North America, since 1943.

Having won all four of his nominations, Elia Kazan has been honored most often in this category. Clint Eastwood, Miloš Forman, David Lean, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Oliver Stone tie for second place with three wins each. Steven Spielberg has had the most nominations (fourteen). Barbra Streisand, Chloé Zhao and Jane Campion are the only women to have won the award.

Receiving the award in 1984 for &quot;Yentl&quot;, Barbra Streisand became the first woman to win the Golden Globe for Best Director.

She remained the only woman to win a Golden Globe for directing for 37 years until Chloé Zhao won the award for &quot;Nomadland&quot; in 2021 and became the second woman and the first Asian woman to do so.

In the following lists, the first names, listed in bold type against a blue background, are the winners, and the following names are the remaining nominees. The years given are those in which the films under consideration were released, not the year of the ceremony, which takes place in January of the following year.

<text>Lieutenant Commander Edward Henry O&#x27;Hare (March 13, 1914 – November 26, 1943) was an American naval aviator of the United States Navy, who on February 20, 1942, became the Navy&#x27;s first fighter ace of the war when he single-handedly attacked a formation of nine medium bombers approaching his aircraft carrier. Even though he had a limited amount of ammunition, he was credited with shooting down five enemy bombers and became the first naval aviator recipient of the Medal of Honor in World War II.

O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s final action took place on the night of November 26, 1943, while he was leading the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first-ever nighttime fighter attack launched from an aircraft carrier. During this encounter with a group of Japanese torpedo bombers, O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s Grumman F6F Hellcat was shot down; his aircraft was never found. A radio message was sent out, but there was no response. In 1945, the U.S. Navy destroyer was named in his honor.

On September 19, 1949, the Chicago-area Orchard Field Airport was renamed O&#x27;Hare International Airport, six years after O&#x27;Hare perished. An F4F Wildcat, in a livery identical to the aircraft (&quot;White F-15&quot;) flown by O&#x27;Hare, is on display in Terminal 2. The display was formally opened on the seventy-fifth anniversary of his Medal of Honor flight.

==Early life==

Edward Henry &quot;Butch&quot; O&#x27;Hare was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Selma Anna (Lauth) and Edward Joseph O&#x27;Hare. He was of Irish and German descent. Butch had two sisters, Patricia and Marilyn. When their parents divorced in 1927, Butch and his sisters stayed with their mother Selma in St. Louis while their father Edward moved to Chicago. Butch&#x27;s father was a lawyer who worked closely with Al Capone before turning against him and helping convict Capone of tax evasion.

Butch O&#x27;Hare graduated from the Western Military Academy in 1932. The following year, he went on to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. After he graduated and was commissioned as an ensign on June 3, 1937, he served two years on the battleship . In 1939, he started flight training at NAS Pensacola in Florida, flying the Naval Aircraft Factory N3N-1 &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; and Stearman NS-1 biplane trainers, and later the advanced SNJ trainer. On the nimble Boeing F4B-4A, he trained in aerobatics as well as aerial gunnery. He also flew the SBU Corsair and the TBD Devastator.

In November 1939, his father was shot and killed, most likely by Al Capone&#x27;s gunmen. During Capone&#x27;s tax evasion trial in 1931 and 1932, O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s father had provided incriminating evidence which helped finally put Capone away. There is speculation that this was done to ensure that Butch got into the Naval Academy, or to set a good example; it certainly at least partly involved an attempt to distance himself from Capone&#x27;s activities. Whatever the motivation, the elder O&#x27;Hare was shot and killed while driving his car a week before Capone was released from incarceration.
When Butch finished his naval aviation training on May 2, 1940, he was assigned to Fighter Squadron Three (VF-3) on board . O&#x27;Hare then trained on the Grumman F3F and then graduated to the Brewster F2A Buffalo. Lieutenant John Thach, then executive officer of VF-3, discovered O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s exceptional flying abilities and closely mentored the promising young pilot. Thach, who would later develop the Thach Weave aerial combat tactic, emphasized gunnery in his training. In 1941, more than half of all VF-3 pilots, including O&#x27;Hare, earned the &quot;E&quot; for gunnery excellence.

In early 1941, VF-3 transferred to , while carrier &quot;Saratoga&quot; underwent maintenance and overhaul work at Bremerton Navy Yard.
On Monday morning, July 21, O&#x27;Hare made his first flight in a Grumman F4F Wildcat. Following stops in Washington and Dayton, he landed in St. Louis on Tuesday. Visiting the wife of a friend in hospital that afternoon, O&#x27;Hare met his future wife, nurse Rita Wooster, proposing to her the first time they met. After O&#x27;Hare took instruction in Roman Catholicism to convert, he and Rita married in St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church in Phoenix on Saturday, September 6, 1941. For their honeymoon, they sailed to Hawaii on separate ships, Butch on &quot;Saratoga&quot;, which had completed modifications at Bremerton, and Rita on the Matson liner . Butch was called to duty the day after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.

On Sunday evening, January 11, 1942, as Butch and other VF-3 officers ate dinner in the wardroom, the carrier &quot;Saratoga&quot; was damaged by a Japanese torpedo hit while patrolling southwest of Hawaii. She spent five months in repair on the west coast, so VF-3 squadron transferred to the on January 31.

==World War II service ==

===Medal of Honor flight===

O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s most famous flight occurred during the Pacific War on February 20, 1942. O&#x27;Hare and his wingman were the only U.S. Navy fighters available when a second wave of Japanese bombers were attacking his aircraft carrier &quot;Lexington&quot;.

O&#x27;Hare was on board the aircraft carrier &quot;Lexington&quot;, which had been assigned the task of penetrating enemy-held waters north of New Ireland. While still from the harbor at Rabaul, at 10:15, the &quot;Lexington&quot; picked up an unknown aircraft on radar from the ship. A six-plane combat patrol was launched, two fighters being directed to investigate the contact. These two planes, under command of LCDR. John Thach, shot down a four-engined Kawanishi H6K4 Type 97 (&quot;Mavis&quot;) flying boat about out at 11:12. Later two other planes of the combat patrol were sent to another radar contact ahead, shooting down a second &quot;Mavis&quot; at 12:02. A third contact was made out, but reversed course and disappeared. At 15:42 a jagged vee signal drew the attention of the &quot;Lexington&quot;″s radar operator. The contact then was lost but reappeared at 16:25 west. O&#x27;Hare, flying F4F Wildcat BuNo 4031 &quot;White F-15&quot;, was one of several pilots launched to intercept nine Japanese Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bombers from the 4th Kōkūtai&#x27;s 2nd Chutai. O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s squadmates shot down eight bombers (with the ninth falling to an SBD later), but he and his wingman, Marion &quot;Duff&quot; Dufilho, were held back in the event of a second attack.

At 16:49, the &quot;Lexington&quot;″s radar picked up a second formation of &quot;Bettys&quot; from the 4th Kōkūtai&#x27;s 1st Chutai, only out, on the disengaged side of the task force. With the majority of VF-3 still chasing the 2nd Chutai, only O&#x27;Hare and Dufilho were available to intercept. Flying eastward they arrived above the &quot;Bettys&quot; out at 17:00. Dufilho&#x27;s guns jammed, leaving only O&#x27;Hare to protect the carrier. The enemy was in a V-of-Vs formation, flying very close together and using their rear-facing 20mm cannon for mutual protection. O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s Wildcat, armed with four 50-caliber guns, with 450 rounds per gun, giving him about 10 three-second bursts.

O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s initial maneuver was a high-side diving attack from the formation&#x27;s starboard side employing deflection shooting. He managed to hit the outside &quot;Betty&quot;″s right engine and wing fuel tanks; when the stricken craft of Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryosuke Kogiku (3rd Shotai) abruptly lurched to starboard, he switched to the next plane up the line, that of Petty Officer 1st Class Koji Maeda (3rd Shotai leader). Maeda&#x27;s plane caught fire, but his crew managed to put out the flames with &quot;one single spurt of liquid ... from the fire-extinguisher&quot; Both Maeda and Kogiku would catch up with the group before bomb release.

With two &quot;Bettys&quot; out of formation (albeit temporarily), O&#x27;Hare began his second firing pass, this time from the port side. His first target was the outside plane, flown by Petty Officer 1st Class Bin Mori (2nd Shotai). O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s bullets damaged the right engine and left fuel tank, forcing Mori to dump his bombs and abort his mission. O&#x27;Hare then targeted the plane of Petty Officer 1st Class Susumu Uchiyama (1st Shotai), which became his first definite kill.

As O&#x27;Hare began his third firing pass, again from the port side, the remaining &quot;Bettys&quot; were nearing their bomb release point. First, O&#x27;Hare shot down Lieutenant (junior grade) Akira Mitani (2nd Shotai leader). This left the lead plane, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Takuzo Ito, exposed. O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s concentrated fire caused the plane&#x27;s port engine nacelle to break free from its mountings and fall from the plane. The resulting explosion was so violent that the 1st Chutai pilots were convinced that an anti-aircraft burst had struck their commander&#x27;s plane. With a gaping hole in its left-wing, Ito&#x27;s plane fell out of formation.

Shortly afterwards, O&#x27;Hare made a fourth firing pass, likely against Maeda (who had now caught up), but ran out of ammunition. Frustrated, he pulled away to allow the ships to fire their anti-aircraft guns. The four surviving bombers dropped their ordnance, but all their 250 kg bombs missed. O&#x27;Hare believed he had shot down six bombers and damaged a seventh. Captain Sherman would later reduce this to five, as four of the reported nine bombers were still overhead when he pulled off. Thach, hurrying towards the scene with reinforcements after mopping up the 2nd &quot;Chûtai&quot;, saw three enemy bombers falling in flames at the same time.

In fact, O&#x27;Hare destroyed only three &quot;Bettys&quot;: Uchiyama&#x27;s, Mitani&#x27;s, and Ito&#x27;s. The last plane, however, was not yet finished. Ito&#x27;s command pilot, Warrant Officer Chuzo Watanabe, regained enough control to level his damaged plane and attempted to crash it into &quot;Lexington&quot;. He missed, and flew into the water near the carrier at 17:12. Another three &quot;Bettys&quot; were damaged by O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s attacks. Of these, Maeda and Kogiku safely landed at Vunakanau airdrome at 19:50, while Mori became lost in a storm and eventually ditched at Simpson Harbor at 20:10.

With his ammunition expended, O&#x27;Hare returned to his carrier, and was fired on accidentally but with no effect by a .50-caliber machine gun from the &quot;Lexington&quot;. O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s fighter had, in fact, been hit by only one bullet during his flight, the single bullet hole in F-15&#x27;s port wing disabling the airspeed indicator. According to Thach, O&#x27;Hare then approached the gun platform to calmly say to the embarrassed anti-aircraft gunner who had fired at him, &quot;Son, if you don&#x27;t stop shooting at me when I&#x27;ve got my wheels down, I&#x27;m going to have to report you to the gunnery officer.&quot;

In the opinion of Admiral Brown and of Captain Frederick C. Sherman, commanding the &quot;Lexington&quot;, Lieutenant O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s actions may have saved the carrier from serious damage or even loss. By 19:00 all &quot;Lexington&quot; planes had been recovered except for two F4F-3 Wildcats shot down while attacking enemy bombers; both were lost while making steady, no-deflection runs from astern of their targets. The pilot of one fighter was rescued, the other went down with his aircraft.

The F4F Wildcat O&#x27;Hare flew was BuNo. 4031 as discovered in his Aviator Logbook. The side number was found out to be F-15 based on Captain Burt Stanley&#x27;s Diary. After &quot;Lexington&quot; returned to port, 4031 was transferred to VF-2 and flew from &quot;Lexington&quot; at Coral Sea. It was one of the six VF-2 Wildcats to survive as it landed on &quot;Yorktown&quot;. After Coral Sea it served in VF-42 and later Marine Air Group 23 before being struck in July 1944.

===Accolades===

On March 26, O&#x27;Hare was greeted at Pearl Harbor by a horde of reporters and radio announcers. During a radio broadcast in Honolulu, he enjoyed the opportunity to say hello to his wife Rita (&quot;Here&#x27;s a great big radio hug, the best I can do under the circumstances&quot;) and to his mother (&quot;Love from me to you&quot;). On April 8, he thanked the Grumman Aircraft Corporation plant at Bethpage (where the F4F Wildcat was made) for 1,150 cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes, a grand total of 230,000 smokes. Ecstatic Grumman workers had passed the hat to buy the cigarettes in appreciation of O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s combat victories in one of their F4F Wildcats. A loyal Camel smoker, O&#x27;Hare opened a carton, deciding that it was the least he could do for the good people back in Bethpage. In his letter to the Grumman employees he wrote, &quot;You build them, we&#x27;ll fly them and between us, we can&#x27;t be beaten.&quot; It was a sentiment he would voice often in the following two months.

Credited with shooting down five bombers, O&#x27;Hare became a flying ace, was selected for promotion to lieutenant commander, and became the first naval aviator to receive the Medal of Honor. With President Franklin D. Roosevelt looking on, O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s wife Rita placed the Medal around his neck. After receiving the Medal of Honor, then-Lieutenant O&#x27;Hare was described as &quot;modest, inarticulate, humorous, terribly nice and more than a little embarrassed by the whole thing&quot;.

O&#x27;Hare received further decorations later in 1943 for actions in battles near Marcus Island in August and subsequent missions near Wake Island in October.

===Non-combat duty===

O&#x27;Hare was not employed on combat duty from early 1942 until late 1943. Important events in this period included flying an F4F-3A Wildcat (BuNo 3986 &quot;White F-13&quot;) as Lieutenant Commander &#x27;Jimmy&#x27; Thach&#x27;s wingman for publicity footage on April 11, 1942, the Medal of Honor presentation at the White House on April 21, and the welcome parade in O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s hometown on Saturday, April 25, 1942.

The welcome parade was held in St. Louis. At the starting point, O&#x27;Hare, wearing the blue-ribboned Medal of Honor around his neck, was guided to the back seat of a black open Packard Phaeton, where he sat between his wife Rita and his mother Selma. The parade began at noon, led by a police motorcycle escort, then came the band from Jefferson Barracks, marching veterans, a truck packed with photographers, O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s Phaeton (with a six-man Marine honor guard alongside) and other open cars. Bringing up the rear was the entire 350-member student body of Western Military Academy. St. Louis Mayor William Dee Becker presented O&#x27;Hare with a gold navigator&#x27;s four-dial watch engraved with the words &quot;To Lt. Commander Edward H. O&#x27;Hare, USN, from a proud and grateful City of St. Louis, April 25, 1942&quot;. As O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s mother and his sisters clipped newspaper stories and photos the following days, his place in history began to dawn on them. A newspaper headline read, &quot;60,000 give O&#x27;Hare a hero&#x27;s welcome here.&quot; The United States in 1942 badly needed a live hero, and Butch O&#x27;Hare was a young, handsome naval aviator, so he participated in several war bond tours the following months.

On June 19, 1942, O&#x27;Hare assumed command of VF-3, relieving Lieutenant Commander Thach. He was relocated to Maui, Hawaii, to instruct other pilots in combat tactics. U.S. Navy policy was to use its best combat pilots to train newer pilots, in contrast to the Japanese practice of keeping their best pilots flying combat missions. Ensign Edward L. &quot;Whitey&quot; Feightner, who served with O&#x27;Hare in July 1942, later said that one of the best pieces of information O&#x27;Hare passed on to him, was:

An anecdote about O&#x27;Hare, serving as an instructor on Hawaii mid-1942:

On March 2, 1943, O&#x27;Hare met Rita and hugged his one-month-old daughter, Kathleen, for the first time. His family resided in Coronado at 549 Orange Avenue, near North Island NAS. At the end of March 1943, O&#x27;Hare made Ensign Alexander Vraciu, a young Naval Reservist just out of flight school, his wingman. On July 15, 1943, VF-3 swapped designations with VF-6 squadron.

===Return to combat===

Equipped with the highly successful follow-on to the Wildcat, the new Grumman F6F-3 Hellcat, two-thirds of VF-6 (twenty-four F6F-3s) under O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s command embarked on August 22, 1943, on the light carrier . The arrival of the F6Fs with their powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 radial engines in late 1943 combined with the deployment of the new carriers and the carriers immediately gave the U.S. Pacific Fleet air supremacy wherever the Fast Carrier Force operated. The Hellcat&#x27;s first combat mission occurred on August 31, 1943, in a strike against Marcus Island. The F6F did well against Japanese fighters and proved that with the right tactics and teamwork the Japanese Zero need not be considered a superior enemy. VF-6&#x27;s combat debut on the &quot;Independence&quot; also went reasonably well. For his actions in battles near Marcus Island on August 31, 1943, O&#x27;Hare was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. For his actions in subsequent missions near Wake Island on October 5, 1943, O&#x27;Hare was awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a second Distinguished Flying Cross.
On October 10, 1943, O&#x27;Hare flew with VF-6 again in the airstrikes against Wake Island. On this mission, the future ace Lt.(jg) Alex Vraciu was his wingman – both Butch and Vraciu shot down one enemy plane that day. When they came across an enemy formation Butch took the outside aeroplane and Vraciu took the inside plane. Butch went below the clouds to get a Japanese Mitsubishi Zero and Vraciu lost him, so Vraciu kept an eye on a second Zero that went to Wake Island and landed. Vraciu strafed the Zero on the ground, then saw a &quot;Betty&quot; bomber and shot it down. Upon returning to the carrier, O&#x27;Hare asked Vraciu where he went and Vraciu knew then that he should have definitely stayed with his leader. Alex Vraciu later said after the war, &quot;O&#x27;Hare taught many of the squadron members little things that would later save their lives. One example was to swivel your neck before starting a strafing run to make sure enemy fighters were not on your tail.&quot; Vraciu also learned from O&#x27;Hare the &quot;high side pass&quot; used for attacking the G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bombers. The high side technique was used to avoid the lethal 20 mm fire of the &quot;Betty&quot;″s tail gunner. The Wake Island raid would be the last occasion Butch would lead VF-6 in battle. According to orders dated September 17, 1943, October found O&#x27;Hare as Commander Air Group (CAG) commanding Air Group Six, embarked on USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Functioning as CAG, O&#x27;Hare was given command of the entire &quot;Enterprise&quot; air group: Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters, Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers, Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and 100 pilots.

Now overseeing three squadrons, O&#x27;Hare still insisted that everyone call him &quot;Butch&quot;. O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s VF-6 squadron would &quot;still stay broken up&quot; among three light aircraft carriers, the squadron had made itself just too useful filling out the light carrier air groups, and AirPac had no well-trained replacements on hand. As a result, Fighting Squadron Two (VF-2) boarded the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; from November 1943 and became Butch&#x27;s new Fighting Squadron. While he readied his new air group, he suffered what he intended as only a temporary separation from his beloved VF-6 &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; Squadron. The news, that the commanding officer had to leave them, hit the men of VF-6 hard. O&#x27;Hare first flew a TBM-1 Avenger as CAG-6 command aircraft with bombardier Del Delchamps, AOM1/c and radioman Hal Coleman as crew members. With its good radio facilities, docile handling, and long-range, the Grumman Avenger made an ideal command aircraft for Air Group Commanders (CAGs), but Butch considered the Grumman torpedo bomber as a &#x27;lame turkey&#x27; compared to the Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter.

Later Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford honored a request from O&#x27;Hare to take a fighter as command aircraft instead of the Avenger, so O&#x27;Hare in a fateful decision happily drew Grumman F6F-3 Hellcat Bureau Number 66168 from the fleet pool to become his principal CAG plane, numbered &quot;00&quot;. From 20 – November 23, 1943, the U.S. forces landed in the Gilberts (Tarawa and Makin), and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; joined in providing close air support to the Marines landing on Makin Island. Equipped with the Grumman F6F Hellcat, the U.S. Navy fighter pilots could protect the fleet from attacking Japanese aircraft.

===Final mission and death===
Faced with U.S. daylight air superiority, the Japanese quickly developed tactics to send torpedo-armed &quot;Betty&quot; bombers on night missions from their bases in the Marianas against the U.S. aircraft carriers. In late November they launched these low-altitude strikes almost nightly to attack &quot;Enterprise&quot; and other American ships, so Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford, O&#x27;Hare and Commander Tom Hamilton, CV-6 air officer, were deeply involved in developing ad hoc counter-tactics, the first carrier-based night fighter operations of the U.S. Navy. O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s plan required the carrier&#x27;s Fighter Director Officer (FDO) to spot incoming enemy formations at a distance and send a &quot;Bat Team&quot; section consisting of a Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber and two Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters toward the Japanese intruders. Although improvements in new types of aviation radar were soon forthcoming from the engineers at MIT and the electronic industry, the available primitive radars in 1943 were very bulky, attributed to the fact that they contained vacuum tube technology. Radars were carried only on the roomy TBF Avengers, but not on the smaller and faster Hellcats, so the radar-equipped TBF Avenger would lead the Hellcats into position behind the incoming bombers, close enough for the F6F pilots to spot visually the blue exhaust flames of the Japanese bombers. Finally, the Hellcats would close in and shoot down the torpedo-carrying bombers.

One of the four &quot;Bat Team&quot; fighter pilots to conduct these experimental night fighter operations to intercept and destroy enemy bombers attacking Allied landing forces was then-LT Roy Marlin Voris, who after the war founded and commanded the Navy&#x27;s flight demonstration squadron, the Blue Angels.

On the night of November 26, 1943, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; introduced the experiment in the co-operative control of Avengers and Hellcats for night fighting, when the three-plane team from the ship broke up a large group of land-based bombers attacking Task Group TG 50.2. O&#x27;Hare volunteered to lead this mission to conduct the first-ever Navy nighttime fighter attack from an aircraft carrier to intercept a large force of enemy torpedo bombers. When the call came to man the fighters, Butch O&#x27;Hare was eating. He grabbed up part of his supper in his fist and started running for the ready room. He was dressed in loose marine coveralls. The night fighter unit consisting of 1 VT and 2 VF was catapulted between 17:58 and 18:01. The pilots for this flight were Butch O&#x27;Hare and Ensign Warren Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Skon of VF-2 in F6Fs and the Squadron Commander of VT-6, LCDR John C. Phillips in a TBF-1C. The crew of the TBF torpedo plane consisted of LTJG Hazen B. Rand, a radar specialist and Alvin Kernan, A. B., AOM1/c. The &quot;Black Panthers&quot;, as the night fighters were dubbed, took off before dusk and flew out into the incoming mass of Japanese planes.

Confusion and complications endangered the success of the mission. The Hellcats first had trouble finding the Avenger, the FDO had difficulty guiding any of them on the targets. O&#x27;Hare and Ensign W. Skon in their F6F Hellcats finally got into position behind the Avenger. Butch O&#x27;Hare had been well aware of the deadly danger of friendly fire in this situation – he radioed to the Avenger pilot of his section, &quot;Hey, Phil, turn those running lights on. I want to be sure it&#x27;s a yellow devil I&#x27;m drilling.&quot;

O&#x27;Hare was last seen at the 5 o&#x27;clock position of the TBF. About that time, the turret gunner of the TBF, Alvin Kernan (AOM1/c) noticed a Japanese G4M &quot;Betty&quot; bomber above and almost directly behind O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s 6 o&#x27;clock position. Kernan opened fire with the TBF&#x27;s .50 cal. machine gun in the dorsal turret and a Japanese gunner fired back. O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s F6F Hellcat apparently was caught in a crossfire. Seconds later O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s F6F slid out of formation to port, pushing slightly ahead at about and then vanished in the dark. The Avenger pilot, Lieutenant Commander Phillips, called repeatedly to O&#x27;Hare, but received no reply. Ensign Skon responded: &quot;Mr Phillips, this is Skon. I saw Mr O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s lights go out and, at the same instant, he seemed to veer off and slant down into darkness.&quot; Phillips later asserted, as the Hellcat dropped out of view, it seemed to release something that fell almost vertically at a speed too slow for anything but a parachute. Then something &quot;whitish-gray&quot; appeared below, perhaps the splash of the aircraft plunging into the sea.

Lieutenant Commander Phillips reported the position () to the ship. After dawn, a three-plane search was made, but no trace of O&#x27;Hare or his aircraft was found. On November 29 a PBY Catalina flying boat also conducted a search with no positive result, and O&#x27;Hare was reported missing in action.

For 54 years there was no definitive answer as to whether he had been brought down by friendly fire or the Japanese bomber&#x27;s nose gunner. In 1997, &quot;Fateful Rendezvous: The Life of Butch O&#x27;Hare&quot;, by Steve Ewing and John B. Lundstrom (see References below) shed new light. Ewing and Lundstrom state that Japanese guns, and not Kernan&#x27;s, killed O&#x27;Hare.

In Chapter 16, &quot;What Happened to Butch&quot;, the authors write, &quot;Butch fell to his old familiar adversary, a Betty. Most likely he died from or was immediately disabled by, a lucky shot from the forward observer crouched in the &quot;rikko&#x27;s&quot; [Betty&#x27;s] forward glassed-in nose ... the nose gunner&#x27;s 7.7 mm slugs very likely penetrated Butch&#x27;s cockpit from above on the port side and ahead of the F6F&#x27;s armor plate.&quot; In the index, Ewing and Lundstrom flatly state that Kernan is &quot;wrongly accused of shooting down Butch.&quot;

Ewing and Lundstrom point out that the &quot;most influential and oft-cited&quot; account of O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s last mission came in a 1962 history of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; by CDR Edward P. Stafford, which relied on action reports and recollections of former &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew, but did not contain interviews with any of the living participants. By contrast, Ewing and Lundstrom came to their conclusions on what happened to Butch after interviewing the still-living survivors of O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s last mission: F6F pilot Skon, TBF radar officer Rand, and TBF gunner Kernan. Ewing and Lundstrom write, &quot;Through Stafford and other accounts based largely on the action reports, Butch has wrongly become known as one of America&#x27;s most famous &#x27;friendly fire&#x27; casualties.&quot;

On December 9, the official word arrived that O&#x27;Hare was missing in action. His mother Selma left for San Diego to be with his wife Rita and his daughter Kathleen. LCDR Bob Jackson wrote to Rita O&#x27;Hare from the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to describe the extensive but unsuccessful search for her husband. In the letter, LCDR Jackson quoted RADM Arthur W. Radford saying of Butch O&#x27;Hare that he &quot;never saw one individual so universally liked.&quot; The hardest thing O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s former wingman Alex Vraciu had to do was to talk to O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s wife Rita after returning stateside. On December 20, 1943, a Solemn Pontifical Mass of Requiem was offered for Butch O&#x27;Hare at the St. Louis Cathedral.

As O&#x27;Hare went missing on November 26, 1943, and was declared dead a year later, his widow Rita received her husband&#x27;s posthumous decorations, a Purple Heart and the Navy Cross on November 26, 1944.

==Honors and awards==


===Medal of Honor citation===


===Navy Cross citation===
===USS &quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot;===
On January 27, 1945, the United States Navy named a in his honor. The ship was launched June 22, 1945, with his mother, Selma O&#x27;Hare, as the sponsor. &quot;O&#x27;Hare&quot; was decommissioned on October 31, 1973, then transferred on loan and later sold to the Spanish Navy. In 1992, the Spanish Navy decommissioned and scrapped the ship.

===O&#x27;Hare International Airport===

Colonel Robert R. McCormick, publisher of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, suggested that the name of Chicago&#x27;s Orchard Depot Airport be changed as a tribute to O&#x27;Hare. On September 19, 1949, the airport was renamed O&#x27;Hare International Airport to honor O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s bravery. The airport displays a Grumman F4F-3 like the one flown during the Medal of Honor action.

The Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat on display was recovered virtually intact from the bottom of Lake Michigan, where it sank after a training accident in 1943 when it went off the training aircraft carrier . In 2001, the Air Classics Museum remodeled the aircraft to replicate the F4F-3 Wildcat that O&#x27;Hare flew on his Medal of Honor flight. The restored Wildcat is exhibited in the west end of Terminal 2 behind the security checkpoint to honor O&#x27;Hare International Airport&#x27;s namesake.

===Other honors===
The same month, O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s name was engraved on the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific &quot;Wall of the Missing&quot; in Honolulu. In March 1963, President John F. Kennedy performed a wreath-laying ceremony at O&#x27;Hare Airport to honor Butch O&#x27;Hare. The Patriots Point Naval and Maritime Museum is honoring O&#x27;Hare with an F4F-3A on display and a plaque dedicated by the USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; CV-10 association, &quot;May Butch O&#x27;Hare rest in peace ...&quot;. O&#x27;Hare was a great man

<text>The Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy is a Golden Globe Award that has been awarded annually since 1952 by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA).

==Eligibility==
Eligible films must be at least 70 minutes in length, be commercially released for at least seven days in the &quot;greater Los Angeles area&quot;, and screened for the HFPA membership. The commercial release must begin during the calendar year prior to the awards ceremony, and the screening can occur no later than one week after commercial release. For purposes of the award, a &quot;musical&quot; is &quot;a comedy or a drama in which songs are used in addition to spoken dialogue to further the plot.&quot;

Under the 2007 revised rules of the HFPA, animated films were no longer eligible in this or the category of Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama, instead competing exclusively in the new category of Best Animated Feature Film; until 2023 prior of the now-defunct Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the rule is amended by Dick Clark Productions following controversies of splitting votes between the main categories, which animated films are still allowed to be eligible in this category or Drama as well as Animated at the same time in similar vein to Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and newly-established Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.

<doc id="186064" wikidata="Q1653736" url="?curid=186064" title="Fiona Stanley">
<text>Fiona Juliet Stanley is an Australian epidemiologist noted for her public health work, her research into child and maternal health as well as birth disorders such as cerebral palsy. Stanley is the patron of the Telethon Kids Institute and a distinguished professorial fellow in the School of Paediatrics and Child Health at the University of Western Australia. From 1990 to December 2011 she was the founding director of Telethon Kids.

==Early life and education==
Fiona Juliet Stanley was born in Little Bay, New South Wales. She loved reading about people such as Marie Curie and through her father, who was a researcher on polio, she met Jonas Salk. She has said of her childhood that &quot;In my dreams I would sail out to all the undiscovered islands and inoculate the inhabitants in a whirlwind race to conquer disease and pestilence.&quot;

In 1956, the family moved to Western Australia when Stanley&#x27;s father took the Foundation Chair of Microbiology at the University of Western Australia. Stanley attended St Hilda&#x27;s Anglican School for Girls before studying medicine at the University of Western Australia, graduating in 1970.

==Career==
Her first job, in the early 1970s, was in a paediatric clinic at Perth&#x27;s former children&#x27;s hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, where her patients included thin and sick Aboriginal children flown in from remote western settlements. She said of this work that &quot;we would perform expensive &#x27;miracles&#x27; ... and then dump them back into the environments that had caused their problems&quot;. Consequently, she says, she started travelling, with colleagues, to &quot;every mission camp, reserve and fringe-dwelling group in Western Australia ... talking to the old people ... trying to get a handle on the health issues and the environmental issues&quot;. She began to understand the impact of life chances and living conditions on children. She also worked at the Australian Aborigine Aboriginal Clinic in East Perth.

This experience sparked an interest in epidemiology and public health. She spent six years in the United Kingdom, at the Social Medicine Unit at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, and the United States researching these areas before returning to Perth to establish research programs at the University and within the health department. She became &quot;Part of the next trend in medicine, the move from a preoccupation with curing disease to a focus on prevention and social causal pathways&quot;.

During her career, Stanley has focussed on the importance of using population data to provide significant health, social and economic benefits to the community. In 1977, her research group established the WA Maternal and Child Health Research Database. It is a unique collection of data on births from the entire state which has proved a valuable resource in predicting trends in maternal and child health and the effects of preventive programs. Stanley&#x27;s research also includes strategies to enhance health and well-being in populations; the causes and prevention of birth defects and major neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy; the causes and lifelong consequences of low birth weight; and patterns of maternal and child health in Aboriginal and Caucasian populations. &quot;Data collected enabled Stanley and her colleagues to explore, for instance, the connection between a lack of folic acid in diets and spina bifida, and markedly reduce it&quot;. This work in 1989 confirmed that the benefit of folate in preventing spina bifida, as first shown in double blind clinical trials in the UK (Laurence et al., BMJ 282 1509–1511 (1981)), also applied in Western Australian populations.

In 1990, she became the founding director of the Telethon Kids Institute, in Nedlands, Western Australia. The institute is a multi-disciplinary research facility that investigates the causes and prevention of major childhood diseases and disabilities. Since 1995 it has received major funding from an annual telethon. It also receives federal and state funding, and monies from research foundations, grants and commercial contracts.

In 2002, due largely to her lobbying, the prime minister of Australia, John Howard, launched the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth (ARACY) of which she is chairperson. The alliance has offices located in Canberra, Perth and Melbourne and aims to progress collaboration and evidence-based action to improve the wellbeing of young Australians. In her 2003 Kenneth Myer Lecture at the National Library of Australia she talked about &quot;modernity&#x27;s paradox&quot; in which increasing wealth and opportunity has also resulted in increased social differences and more problems for children and youth, including increases in asthma, obesity, diabetes, child abuse, binge-drinking, drug abuse and mental health problems. She argued for cross-disciplinary work and said the challenge is &quot;to intervene earlier in the causal cycles&quot;.

Stanley is a professor at the School of Paediatrics and Child Health at University of Western Australia and the UNICEF Australian ambassador for Early Childhood Development. She was named Australian of the Year in 2003. In 2011 she was appointed to the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation by communications minister Stephen Conroy. Phase one of the hospital, the Fiona Stanley Hospital named in her honour, officially opened on 3 October 2014.

<text>The Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy is a Golden Globe Award that was first awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association as a separate category in 1951. Previously, there was a single award for &quot;Best Actress in a Motion Picture&quot;, but the splitting allowed for recognition of it and the Best Actress – Drama.

The formal title has varied since its inception. In 2005, it was officially called &quot;Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical&quot;. The current wording is &quot;Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy&quot;.

<doc id="186072" wikidata="Q107582" url="?curid=186072" title="Cēsis">
<text>Cēsis (), (, , , ) is a town in Latvia located in the northern part of the Central Vidzeme Upland. Cēsis is on the Gauja River valley, and is built on a series of ridges above the river, overlooking the woods below. Cēsis was selected to be one of the candidate cities for the title of the European Capital of Culture 2014 (Riga was the Latvian city that won the title).

==Castle==
The oldest settlement in Cēsis is the hillfort on Riekstu hill, a fortified wooden castle built by a tribe known as the Vends. The mound with its partly preserved fortification system can still be seen in the Castle Park. This settlement was located near major trade routes from west to east and dominated the regional countryside.

German crusaders known as the Livonian Brothers of the Sword began construction of a castle &quot;Wenden&quot; near the hill fort in 1209. When the castle was enlarged and fortified, it served as the residence for the Order&#x27;s Master. In 1577, during the Livonian War, the garrison destroyed the castle to prevent it from falling into the control of Ivan the Terrible, who was decisively defeated in the Battle of Wenden (1578). In 1598, it was incorporated into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Wenden Voivodeship was created. In 1620 Wenden was conquered by Sweden. It was rebuilt afterwards, but destroyed again in 1703 during the Great Northern War by the Russian army and left in a ruined state. From the end of the 16th century, the premises of the Order&#x27;s castle were adapted to the requirements of the Cēsis castle estate. When in 1777 the Cēsis castle estate was obtained by Count Sievers, he had his new residence house built on the site of the Eastern Block of the castle, joining its end wall with the fortification tower. Since 1949, the Cēsis History Museum has been located in the New Castle on the Cēsis Castle estate. The front yard of the New Castle is enclosed by a granary and a stable-coach house, which now houses the Exhibition Hall of the Museum. Beside the granary there is the oldest brewery in Latvia—Cēsu Alus, which was built in 1878 during the latter years of Count Sievers&#x27; residency, but its origins date back to the period of the Livonian Order.

Further on is the Cēsis castle park, which was laid out in 1812. The park has the romantic characteristic of that time, with its footpaths, exotic plants, and the waters of the pond reflecting the castle&#x27;s ruins.

==The town==

The planning of the town of Cēsis was done in the second half of the 13th century. The marketplace with a church was in the centre of the town. The centre of housing was the stone castle of the Livonian Order, with its three fortified towers. The town was also encircled by a dolomite stone wall with eight towers and five gates. Buildings from the Middle Ages include St. John&#x27;s Church (built 1281–1284), the ruins of the Order&#x27;s castle, Cēsis Castle and fortification walls, fragments of which can still be seen at Vaļņu iela and Palasta iela. In addition, ancient road networks and building plots have survived from medieval times, although many of the buildings themselves have been ruined (the last destroyed in 1748). 18th century buildings can be seen at 16 and 25 Rīgas iela, while houses built in the first part of the 19th century are at 15 and 47 Rīgas iela, 6 Gaujas iela, and other streets. Cēsis was occupied by the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus in 1621 during the Polish–Swedish War.

In the second half of the 19th century, the construction of the Rīga-Pskov highway (1868) and the Rīga-Valka railway line (1889) accelerated the development of the town. Raunas iela, leading from the railway station to the Old Town, was developed as a wide, presentable street with the Latvian Society House at 10 Raunas iela (architect Augusts Malvess), the Building of the Regional Court at 14 Raunas iela (architect P. Mengelis), and other important buildings.

The Battle of Cēsis in June 1919, when Estonian and Latvian forces defeated the Germans, was one of the decisive battles in the Latvian War of Independence.

Cēsis was also developed as a health resort. Upmarket summer houses and health centres were built in the vicinity of the Gauja. &#x27;Cīrulīši&#x27; near the Svētavots (Holy Spring) Cave is the most remarkable of them, with a spring believed to possess healing powers.

==Climate==
Cēsis has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;).

<doc id="186073" wikidata="Q381054" url="?curid=186073" title="Robert Hanssen">
<text>Robert Philip Hanssen (April 18, 1944 – June 5, 2023) was an American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent who spied for Soviet and Russian intelligence services against the United States from 1979 to 2001. His espionage was described by the U.S. Department of Justice as &quot;possibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history&quot;.

In 1979, three years after joining the FBI, Hanssen approached the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) to offer his services, beginning his first espionage cycle, lasting until 1981. He restarted his espionage activities in 1985 and continued until 1991, when he ended communications during the collapse of the Soviet Union, fearing he would be exposed. Hanssen restarted communications the next year and continued until his arrest. Throughout his spying, he remained anonymous to the Russians.

Hanssen sold about six thousand classified documents to the KGB that detailed U.S. strategies in the event of nuclear war, developments in military weapons technologies, and aspects of the U.S. counterintelligence program. He was spying at the same time as Aldrich Ames in the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Both Ames and Hanssen compromised the names of KGB agents working secretly for the U.S., some of whom were executed for their betrayal. Hanssen also revealed a multimillion-dollar eavesdropping tunnel built by the FBI under the Soviet Embassy. After Ames&#x27;s arrest in 1994, some of these intelligence breaches remained unsolved, and the search for another spy continued. The FBI paid $7million to a KGB agent to obtain a file on an anonymous mole, whom the FBI later identified as Hanssen through fingerprint and voice analysis.

Hanssen was arrested on February 18, 2001, at Foxstone Park, near his home in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Vienna, Virginia, after leaving a package of classified materials at a dead drop site. He was charged with selling U.S. intelligence documents to the Soviet Union and subsequently Russia for more than $1.4 million in cash, diamonds and Rolex watches over twenty-two years. To avoid the death penalty, Hanssen pleaded guilty to 14 counts of espionage and one of conspiracy to commit espionage. He was sentenced to 15 life terms without the possibility of parole, and was incarcerated at ADX Florence until his death in 2023.

==Early life==
Hanssen was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a Lutheran family that lived in the Norwood Park neighborhood. His father, Howard (died 1993), a Chicago police officer, was allegedly emotionally abusive to Hanssen during his childhood. Hanssen graduated from William Howard Taft High School in 1962 and attended Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry in 1966.

Hanssen applied for a cryptography job at the National Security Agency following his college graduation but was turned down due to budget constraints. He enrolled in dental school at Northwestern University, but he switched his focus to business after three years. Hanssen received an MBA in accounting and information systems in 1971 and took a job with an accounting firm. He quit after one year and joined the Chicago Police Department as an internal affairs investigator, specializing in forensic accounting. In January 1976, Hanssen left the Chicago police to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Hanssen met Bernadette &quot;Bonnie&quot; Wauck, a staunch Roman Catholic, while attending dental school at Northwestern. The couple married in 1968, and Hanssen converted from Lutheranism to Catholicism.

== Career and espionage ==

=== FBI career and first espionage activities (1976–1981) ===
Upon becoming a special agent on January 12, 1976, Hanssen was transferred to the FBI&#x27;s field office in Gary, Indiana. In 1978, he and his growing family of three (eventually six) children relocated to New York City when the bureau transferred him to its field office there. The next year, Hanssen was transferred to counterintelligence and given the task of compiling a database of Soviet intelligence for the FBI.

In 1979, Hanssen approached the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) and offered his services. He never indicated any political or ideological motive for his actions, telling the FBI after he was caught that his only motivation was financial. During his first espionage cycle, Hanssen provided a significant amount of information to the GRU, including details of the FBI&#x27;s bugging activities and lists of suspected Soviet intelligence agents. His most important leak was the betrayal of Dmitri Polyakov, a CIA informant who passed enormous amounts of information to U.S. intelligence while rising to the rank of general in the Soviet Army. Following a second betrayal by CIA mole Aldrich Ames in 1985, Polyakov was arrested in 1986 and executed in 1988. Ames was officially blamed for giving Polyakov&#x27;s name to the Soviets, while Hanssen&#x27;s attempt was not revealed until after his 2001 capture.

=== FBI counterintelligence unit, further espionage activities (1985–1991) ===

In 1981, Hanssen was transferred to FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., and relocated his family to the suburb of Vienna, Virginia. His new job in the FBI&#x27;s budget office gave him access to information involving many different FBI operations. This included all the FBI activities related to wiretapping and electronic surveillance, which were Hanssen&#x27;s responsibility. He became known in the FBI as an expert on computers.

Three years later, Hanssen transferred to the FBI&#x27;s Soviet analytical unit, responsible for studying, identifying, and capturing Soviet spies and intelligence operatives in the United States. Hanssen&#x27;s section evaluated Soviet agents who volunteered to give intelligence to determine whether they were genuine or re-doubled agents. In 1985, Hanssen was again transferred to the FBI&#x27;s field office in New York City, where he continued to work in counterintelligence against the Soviets. After the transfer, while on a business visit back to Washington, he resumed his espionage career.

On October 1, 1985, Hanssen sent an anonymous letter to the KGB offering his services and asking for $100,000 in cash, . In the letter, he gave the names of three KGB agents secretly working for the FBI: Boris Yuzhin, Valery Martinov, and Sergei Motorin. Although Hanssen was unaware of it, Ames had already exposed all three agents earlier that year. Yuzhin had returned to Moscow in 1982 and had been subject to an intensive investigation by the KGB because he had lost a concealed camera in the Soviet consulate in San Francisco, but he was not arrested until exposed by Ames and Hanssen. Martynov and Motorin were recalled to Moscow, where they were arrested, charged, tried, and convicted of espionage against the Soviet government. Martynov and Motorin were executed via gunshot to the back of the head; Yuzhin was imprisoned for six years before he was released by a general amnesty granted political prisoners and he subsequently immigrated to the U.S. Because the FBI blamed Ames for the leak, Hanssen was neither suspected nor investigated. The October 1 letter began a long, active espionage period for Hanssen.

Hanssen was recalled yet again to Washington, D.C., in 1987. He was tasked with studying all known and rumored penetrations of the FBI to find the man who had betrayed Martynov and Motorin; this meant, in effect, that he was charged with searching for himself. Hanssen ensured that he did not reveal himself with his study, but in addition, he gave the entire study—including the list of all Soviets who had contacted the FBI about FBI moles—to the KGB in 1988. That same year, Hanssen, according to a government report, committed a &quot;serious security breach&quot; by revealing secret information to a Soviet defector during a debriefing. The agents working for him reported this breach to a supervisor, but no action was taken.

In 1989, Hanssen compromised the FBI investigation of Felix Bloch, a Department of State official who was suspected of espionage. Hanssen warned the KGB that Bloch was being investigated, causing the KGB to end contact with him abruptly. The FBI could not produce any good evidence, and as a result, Bloch was never charged with a crime, although the State Department later terminated his employment and denied his pension. The failure of the Bloch investigation and the FBI&#x27;s investigation of how the KGB learned that they were investigating Bloch caused the mole hunt that eventually resulted in Hanssen&#x27;s arrest.

Later that year, Hanssen gave the KGB extensive information about U.S. planning for measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT), a general term for intelligence collected by a variety of electronic means, such as radar, spy satellites, and signal intercepts. When the Soviets began construction on a new embassy in 1977, the FBI dug a tunnel beneath their decoding room. The FBI planned to use it for eavesdropping but never did for fear of being caught. Hanssen disclosed this information to the Soviets in September 1989 and received a $55,000 payment the next month, . On two occasions, Hanssen gave the Soviets a complete list of American double agents.

In 1990, Hanssen&#x27;s brother-in-law, Mark Wauck, who was also an FBI employee, recommended to the FBI that Hanssen be investigated for espionage because his sister, Hanssen&#x27;s wife, told him that her sister, Jeanne Beglis, had found a pile of cash on a dresser in the Hanssens&#x27; house. Bonnie had previously told her brother that Hanssen once talked about retiring in Poland, then part of the Eastern Bloc. Wauck also knew that the FBI was hunting for a mole and spoke with his supervisor, who took no action.

=== Later FBI career, continued espionage activities (1992–2001) ===
When the USSR disbanded in December 1991, Hanssen, possibly worried that he could be exposed during the ensuing political upheaval, ended communications with his handlers for a time. The following year, after the Russian Federation assumed control of the defunct Soviet spy agencies, Hanssen made a risky approach to the GRU, with whom he had not been in contact for ten months. He went to the Russian embassy in person and physically approached a GRU officer in the parking garage. Hanssen, carrying a package of documents, identified himself by his Soviet code name, &quot;Ramon Garcia&quot;, and described himself as a &quot;disaffected FBI agent&quot; who was offering his services as a spy. The Russian officer, who evidently did not recognize the code name, drove away. The Russians then filed an official protest with the U.S State Department, believing Hanssen to be a triple agent. Despite having shown his face, disclosing his code name, and revealing his FBI affiliation, Hanssen escaped arrest when the FBI&#x27;s investigation into the incident did not advance.

Hanssen continued to take risks in 1993 when he hacked into the computer of a fellow FBI agent, Ray Mislock, printed out a classified document from Mislock&#x27;s computer and took the document to Mislock, saying, &quot;You didn&#x27;t believe me that the system was insecure.&quot; Hanssen&#x27;s superiors were not amused and began an investigation. In the end, officials believed his claim that he was merely demonstrating flaws in the FBI&#x27;s security system. Mislock has since theorized that Hanssen probably went onto his computer to see if his superiors were investigating him for espionage and invented the document story to cover his tracks.

In 1994, Hanssen expressed interest in a transfer to the new National Counterintelligence Center, which coordinated counterintelligence activities. When told that he would have to take a lie detector test to join, Hanssen changed his mind. Three years later, convicted FBI mole Earl Edwin Pitts told the FBI that he suspected Hanssen due to the Mislock incident. Pitts was the second FBI agent to mention Hanssen by name as a possible mole, but superiors were still unconvinced, and no action was taken.

IT personnel from the National Security Division&#x27;s (NSD) Internet Information Services (IIS) Unit were sent to investigate Hanssen&#x27;s desktop computer after a reported failure. NSD chief Johnnie Sullivan ordered the computer impounded after it seemed to have been tampered with. A digital investigation found that an attempted hacking had occurred using a password cracking program installed by Hanssen, which caused a security alert and lockup. After confirmation by the FBI Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) Unit, Sullivan filed a report with the Office of Professional Responsibility requesting the further investigation of Hanssen&#x27;s attempted hack. Hanssen claimed he was trying to connect a color printer to his computer but needed the password cracker to bypass the administrative password. The FBI believed his story, and Hanssen was merely given a warning.

During the same period, Hanssen searched the FBI&#x27;s internal computer case record to see if he was being investigated. He was indiscreet enough to type his name into FBI search engines. Finding nothing, Hanssen decided to resume his spy career after eight years without contact with the Russians. He established contact with the SVR (a successor to the Soviet-era KGB) during the autumn of 1999. He continued to perform incriminating searches of FBI files for his name and address.

== Investigation and arrest ==
The existence of two Russian moles working in the U.S. security and intelligence establishment simultaneously—Ames at the CIA and Hanssen at the FBI—complicated counterintelligence efforts during the 1990s. Ames was arrested in 1994. His exposure explained many of the asset losses U.S. intelligence suffered during the 1980s, including the arrest and execution of Martinov and Motorin. However, two cases—the Bloch investigation and the embassy tunnel—remained unsolved. Ames had been stationed in Rome at the time of the Bloch investigation and could not have known about that case or the tunnel under the embassy, as he did not work for the FBI.

The FBI and CIA formed a joint mole-hunting team in 1994 to find the suspected second intelligence leak. They created a list of all agents known to have access to cases that were compromised. The FBI&#x27;s codename for the suspected spy was &quot;Graysuit&quot;. Some promising suspects were cleared, and the mole hunt found other penetrations, such as CIA officer Harold James Nicholson, who was arrested in 1996. However, Hanssen escaped notice, likely because these efforts concentrated on CIA agents rather than FBI agents.

By 1998, using FBI criminal profiling techniques, the pursuers suspected an innocent man: Brian Kelley, a CIA operative involved in the Bloch investigation. The CIA and FBI searched his house, tapped his telephone, and surveilled him, following him and his family everywhere. In November 1998, they had a man with a foreign accent come to Kelley&#x27;s door, warn him that the FBI knew he was a spy, and tell him to show up at a Metro station the next day to escape. Kelley instead reported the incident to the FBI. In 1999, the FBI even interrogated Kelley, his ex-wife, two sisters, and three children. All denied everything. He was eventually placed on administrative leave, where he remained, falsely accused until after Hanssen was arrested.

FBI investigators later made progress during an operation where they paid disaffected Russian intelligence officers to deliver information on moles. They paid $7 million to KGB agent Alexandr Shcherbakov who had access to a file on &quot;B&quot;. While it did not contain Hanssen&#x27;s name, among the information was an audiotape of a July 21, 1986, conversation between &quot;B&quot; and KGB agent Aleksander Fefelov. FBI agent Michael Waguespack thought the voice was familiar, but could not remember who it was. Rifling through the rest of the files, they found notes of the mole using a quote from George S. Patton&#x27;s speech to the Third Army about &quot;the purple-pissing Japanese&quot;. FBI analyst Bob King remembered Hanssen using that same quote. Waguespack listened to the tape again and recognized the voice as Hanssen&#x27;s. With the mole finally identified, locations, dates, and cases were matched with Hanssen&#x27;s activities during the period. Two fingerprints collected from a trash bag in the file were analyzed and proved to be Hanssen&#x27;s.
The FBI surveilled Hanssen and soon discovered he was again in contact with the Russians. To bring him back to FBI headquarters, where he could be closely monitored and kept away from sensitive data, they promoted him in December 2000. They gave him a new job supervising FBI computer security. In January 2001, Hanssen was given an office and an assistant, Eric O&#x27;Neill, who was actually a young FBI surveillance specialist who had been assigned to watch Hanssen. O&#x27;Neill ascertained that Hanssen was using a Palm III PDA to store his information. When O&#x27;Neill was able to briefly obtain Hanssen&#x27;s PDA and have agents download and decode its encrypted contents, the FBI acquired their conclusive evidence.

During his final days with the FBI, Hanssen began to suspect something was wrong. In early February 2001, he asked his friend at a computer technology company for a job. He also believed he heard noises on his car radio that indicated it was bugged, although the FBI was later unable to reproduce the noises Hanssen claimed to have heard. In the last letter he wrote to the Russians, which was found by the FBI when he was arrested, Hanssen said that he had been promoted to a &quot;do-nothing job ... outside of regular access to information&quot; and that &quot;Something has aroused the sleeping tiger&quot;.

However, Hanssen&#x27;s suspicions did not stop him from making one more dead drop. After leaving a friend at an airport on February 18, 2001, Hanssen drove to Virginia&#x27;s Foxstone Park. He placed a white piece of tape on a park sign to signal his Russian contacts that there was information at the dead drop site. He then followed his usual routine, taking a sealed garbage bag of classified material and taping it to the bottom side of a wooden footbridge over a creek. When FBI agents observed this incriminating act, they rushed in to arrest Hanssen. Upon being arrested, Hanssen asked, &quot;What took you so long?&quot; The FBI waited two more days to see if any of Hanssen&#x27;s SVR handlers would show up at Foxstone Park. When they failed to appear, the United States Justice Department announced Hanssen&#x27;s arrest on February 20.

=== Guilty plea and imprisonment ===

Represented by Washington, D.C., lawyer Plato Cacheris, Hanssen negotiated a plea bargain that enabled him to avoid the death penalty in exchange for cooperating with authorities. On July 6, 2001, he pleaded guilty to 13 counts of espionage, one count of attempted espionage, and one of conspiracy to commit espionage in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On May 10, 2002, Hanssen was sentenced to 15 consecutive sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole. &quot;I apologize for my behavior. I am shamed by it,&quot; Hanssen told U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton. &quot;I have opened the door for calumny against my totally innocent wife and children. I have hurt so many deeply.&quot;

Hanssen was Federal Bureau of Prisons prisoner #48551-083. From July 17, 2002, until his death, he served his sentence at the ADX Florence, a federal supermax prison near Florence, Colorado, in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.

==&quot;Modus operandi&quot;==
Hanssen never told the KGB or GRU his identity and refused to meet them personally, except for the abortive 1993 contact in the Russian embassy parking garage . The FBI believes that the Russians never knew the name of their source. Going by the alias &quot;Ramon&quot; or &quot;Ramon Garcia&quot;, Hanssen exchanged intelligence and payments through an old-fashioned dead drop system in which he and his KGB handlers left packages in public, unobtrusive places. He refused to use the dead drop sites that his handler, Victor Cherkashin, suggested and instead chose his own. He also designated a code to be used when dates were exchanged. Six was to be added to the month, day, and time of a designated drop, so that, for example, a drop scheduled for January 6 at 1:00p.m. would be written as July 12 at 7:00p.m.

Despite these efforts at caution and security, Hanssen was sometimes reckless. He once said in a letter to the KGB that it should emulate the management style of Mayor of Chicago Richard J. Daley—a comment that easily could have led an investigator to look at people from Chicago. Hanssen took the risk of recommending to his handlers that they try to recruit his closest friend, a colonel in the United States Army.

==Personal life==
According to &quot;USA Today&quot;, those who knew the Hanssens described them as a close family. They attended Mass weekly and were very active in Opus Dei. Hanssen&#x27;s three sons attended The Heights School in Potomac, Maryland, an all-boys preparatory school. His three daughters attended Oakcrest School for Girls in Vienna, Virginia, an independent Roman Catholic school. Both schools are associated with Opus Dei. Hanssen&#x27;s wife, Bonnie, retired from teaching theology at Oakcrest in 2020.

A priest at Oakcrest said Hanssen had regularly attended a 6:30 a.m. daily Mass for over a decade. Opus Dei member C. John McCloskey said he also occasionally attended the daily noontime Mass at the Catholic Information Center in downtown Washington, D.C.. After being imprisoned, Hanssen claimed he periodically admitted his espionage to priests in confession. He urged fellow Catholics in the FBI to attend Mass more often and denounced the Russians as &quot;godless&quot;, even as he was spying for them.

At Hanssen&#x27;s suggestion, and without his wife&#x27;s knowledge, a friend named Jack Hoschouer, a retired Army officer, would sometimes watch the Hanssens having sex through a bedroom window. Hanssen then began to videotape his sexual encounters secretly and shared the videotapes with Hoschouer. Later, he hid a video camera in the bedroom connected via a closed-circuit television line so that Hoschouer could observe the Hanssens from the Hanssens&#x27; guest bedroom. He also explicitly described the sexual details of his marriage in Internet chat rooms, giving information sufficient for those who knew them to recognize the couple.

Hanssen frequently visited D.C. strip clubs and spent a great deal of time with a Washington stripper named Priscilla Sue Galey. She went with Hanssen on visits to Hong Kong and the FBI training facility in Quantico, Virginia. Hanssen gave her money, jewels, and a used Mercedes-Benz but ended contact with her before his arrest when she began abusing drugs and engaging in prostitution. Galey claims that although she offered to have sex with him, Hanssen declined, saying he was trying to convert her to Catholicism.

=== Death ===
On June 5, 2023, Hanssen was found unresponsive in his prison cell and was pronounced dead after unsuccessful efforts to revive him. His autopsy listed the cause of death as colon cancer.

==In the media==
The Hanssen spy case was told in David Wise&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, published by Random House in 2002. The investigation was further covered in Eric O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s memoir &quot;Gray Day: My Undercover Mission to Expose America&#x27;s First Cyber Spy&quot;, published by Penguin Random House in the spring of 2019.

Hanssen was the subject of a 2002 made-for-television movie, &quot;Master Spy: The Robert Hanssen Story&quot;, with a teleplay by Norman Mailer and starring William Hurt as Hanssen. Hanssen&#x27;s jailers allowed him to watch the movie, but he was so angered by it that he turned it off. O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s role in the capture of Robert Hanssen was dramatized in the 2007 movie &quot;Breach&quot;, in which Chris Cooper played the role of Hanssen and Ryan Phillippe played O&#x27;Neill. The 2007 documentary &quot;&quot; describes the hunt to trap Hanssen.

Hanssen was mentioned in chapter 5 of Dan Brown&#x27;s book &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; as the most noted Opus Dei member to non-members. His sexual deviancy and espionage conviction hurt the organization&#x27;s reputation. The U.S. Court TV (now TruTV) television series &quot;Mugshots&quot; released an episode on the Robert Hanssen case titled &quot;Robert Hanssen – Hanssen and the KGB&quot;. Ronald Kessler&#x27;s book &quot;The Secrets of the FBI,&quot; briefly covers the case in chapter 15, &quot;Catching Hanssen&quot;, chapter 16, &quot;Breach&quot;, and chapter 17, &quot;Unexplained Cash&quot;, based in part on interviews with Michael Rochford, who directed the FBI team that located the former KGB source that pointed to Hanssen after Rochford initially wrongly assumed CIA officer Brian Kelley was the master spy. Hanssen&#x27;s story was featured in episode 4, under the name of &quot;Perfect Traitor&quot;, of Smithsonian Channel&#x27;s series &quot;Spy Wars&quot;, which aired at the end of 2019 and was narrated by Damian Lewis, and features Eric O&#x27;Neill as well as being mentioned in the seventh episode of The History Channel series &quot;America&#x27;s Book of Secrets&quot;, as well as in the fifth episode of Netflix series &quot;Spycraft&quot; and was the subject of the 2021 documentary &quot;A Spy in the FBI&quot;. He was also the subject of the CBS News podcast detailing his life and espionage, &quot;Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen&quot;.

<text>The Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama is a Golden Globe Award that was first awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association as a separate category in 1951. Previously, there was a single award for &quot;Best Actor in a Motion Picture&quot; but the splitting allowed for recognition of it and the Best Actor – Musical or Comedy.

The formal title has varied since its inception. In 2005, it was officially called: &quot;Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama&quot;. , the wording is &quot;Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama&quot;.

in 1977, LaBelle began a solo career, starting with her critically acclaimed debut album, which included the career-defining song &quot;You Are My Friend&quot;. LaBelle became a mainstream solo star in 1984 following the success of the singles &quot;If Only You Knew&quot;, &quot;Love, Need and Want You&quot; (later sampled for 2002&#x27;s &quot;Dilemma&quot;), &quot;New Attitude&quot; and &quot;Stir It Up&quot;. In 1986, LaBelle released a number-one album, &quot;Winner in You&quot;, and its number-one single &quot;On My Own&quot;, a duet with Michael McDonald. In 1989, the standard &quot;If You Asked Me To&quot; (later covered by Celine Dion) was released on &quot;Be Yourself&quot;. LaBelle won a 1992 Grammy for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for her 1991 album &quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot;, an album that featured &quot;Somebody Loves You Baby (You Know Who It Is)&quot;, &quot;Feels Like Another One&quot;, and &quot;When You&#x27;ve Been Blessed (Feels Like Heaven)&quot;. She won a second Grammy for the live album &quot;Live! One Night Only&quot;. Her 1990s albums &quot;Burnin&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Gems&quot; (1994), and &quot;Flame&quot; (1997) continued her popularity with young R&amp;B audiences throughout the decade. She reunited with her Labelle bandmates for the album &quot;Back to Now&quot;, which was followed by a well-received promotional tour.

LaBelle has also had success as an actress with a role in the Academy Award-nominated film &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot;, and in television shows such as &quot;A Different World&quot; and &quot;American Horror Story: Freak Show&quot;. In 1992, LaBelle starred in her own sitcom &quot;Out All Night&quot;. In 2002, LaBelle hosted her own lifestyle show, &quot;Living It Up with Patti LaBelle&quot;, on TV One. In 2015, LaBelle took part in the dance competition &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; at the age of 70. Labelle has also seen success launching her own brand of bedding, cookbooks, and food for various companies. In 2015 her &quot;Patti&#x27;s Sweet Potato Pie&quot; sold millions when a YouTube video praising the product went viral. As a result, over a 72-hour period, Walmart sold one pie every second.

In a career which has spanned seven decades, LaBelle has sold more than 50 million records worldwide. She has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame, and the Apollo Theater Hall of Fame. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included her on their list of 100 Greatest Singers. LaBelle is a dramatic soprano recognized for her vocal power, modal register range and emotive delivery.

== Early life and career ==
=== Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles ===
LaBelle was born Patricia Louise Holte in the Eastwick section of Southwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was born the second youngest child of Henry (1919–1989) and Bertha (Robinson; 1916–1978) Holte&#x27;s three children, and the next-to-youngest of five children overall. Her siblings were Thomas Hogan Jr. (1930–2013), Vivian Hogan (1932–1975), Barbara (1942–1982) and Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; (1945–1989). Her father was a railroad worker and club performer and her mother was a domestic. Despite enjoying her childhood, LaBelle would later write in her memoirs, &quot;Don&#x27;t Block the Blessings&quot;, that her parents&#x27; marriage was abusive. Shortly after her parents&#x27; divorce, when LaBelle was twelve, she was sexually molested by a family friend.

She joined a local church choir at the Beulah Baptist Church at ten and performed her first solo two years later. While she was growing up, she listened to secular music styles such as R&amp;B and jazz music as well.

When she was 16, LaBelle won a talent competition at her high school, John Bartram High School. The success led to her first singing group, the Ordettes, in 1960 with schoolmates Jean Brown, Yvonne Hogen, and Johnnie Dawson. With LaBelle as the front woman, the group became a local attraction until two of its members left to marry, while another was forced to quit the group by her religious father. In 1962, the Ordettes included three new members, Cindy Birdsong, Sarah Dash, and Nona Hendryx, the latter two girls had sung for another vocal group which was defunct at the time. In the same year, they auditioned for local record label owner Harold Robinson. Robinson agreed to work with the group after hearing LaBelle sing the song &quot;I Sold My Heart to the Junkman&quot;. Initially, Robinson was dismissive of LaBelle, believing her to be &quot;too dark and too plain&quot;.

Shortly after Robinson signed them, he had them record as the Blue Belles and they were selected to promote the recording of &quot;I Sold My Heart to the Junkman&quot;, which had been recorded by The Starlets. It was recorded as a Blue Belles single due to label conflict. The Starlets&#x27; manager sued Harold Robinson after the Blue Belles were seen performing a lip-synching version of the song on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. After settling out of court, Robinson altered the group&#x27;s name to &quot;Patti LaBelle and The Blue Belles&quot;. Robinson gave Holte the name &quot;LaBelle&quot;, which meant &quot;the beautiful&quot; in French. Initially, a Billboard ad cited the group as &quot;Patti Bell and the Blue Bells&quot;. In 1963, the group scored their first hit single with the ballad &quot;Down the Aisle&quot; which became a crossover top 40 hit on the Billboard pop and R&amp;B charts after King Records issued it.

Later in the year, they recorded their rendition of the &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;; the single was later re-released on Cameo-Parkway Records where the group scored a second hit on the pop charts with the song in 1964. Another charted single, &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, was released that same year. In 1965, after Cameo-Parkway folded, the group moved to New York and signed with Atlantic Records where they recorded twelve singles for the label, including the mildly charted singles &quot;All or Nothing&quot; and &quot;Take Me for a Little While&quot;. The group&#x27;s Atlantic tenure included their rendition of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and a version of the song &quot;Groovy Kind of Love&quot;. In 1967, Birdsong left the group to join The Supremes and by 1970 the group had been dropped from Atlantic Records as well as by their longtime manager Bernard Montague.

In 1970, Vicki Wickham, producer of the UK music show &quot;Ready, Steady, Go&quot;, agreed to manage the group after Dusty Springfield mentioned signing them. Wickham&#x27;s first direction for the group was for them to change their name to simply Labelle and advised the group to renew their act, going for a more homegrown look and sound that reflected funk, rock, and psychedelic soul. In 1971, the group opened for the Who in several stops on the group&#x27;s U.S. tour.

=== Labelle ===

Labelle signed with Warner Bros. Records and released their self-titled debut album in 1971. The record&#x27;s psychedelic soul sound and its blending of rock, funk, soul and gospel rhythms was a departure from the group&#x27;s early girl-group sound. In the same year, they sang background vocals on Laura Nyro&#x27;s album, &quot;Gonna Take a Miracle&quot;. A year later in 1972, the group released &quot;Moon Shadow&quot;, which repeated the homegrown gritty sound of the previous album. In 1973, influenced by glam rockers David Bowie and Elton John, Wickham had the group dressed in silver space suits and luminescent makeup.

After their third successive album, &quot;Pressure Cookin&#x27;&quot;, failed to generate a hit, Labelle signed with Epic Records in 1974, releasing their most successful album to date, with &quot;Nightbirds&quot;, which blended soul, funk, glam and rock music, thanks to the work of the album&#x27;s producer, Allen Toussaint. The proto-disco single, &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, would become their biggest-selling single, going number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and selling over a million copies, as did &quot;Nightbirds&quot;, which later earned a RIAA gold award, for sales of a million units, which was later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In October 1974, Labelle made pop history by becoming the first rock and roll vocal group to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House. Riding high on the success of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; and the &quot;Nightbirds&quot; album, Labelle made the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1975.

Labelle released two more albums, &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Chameleon&quot; in 1975 and 1976, respectively. While both albums continued the group&#x27;s critical success, none of the singles issued on those albums ever crossed over to the pop charts. By 1976, Patti, Nona and Sarah began arguing over the group&#x27;s musical direction. Personal difficulties came to a head during a show on December 16, 1976, in Baltimore where Hendryx went backstage and injured herself during a nervous breakdown. After the incident, LaBelle advised that the group separate.

== Solo career ==
=== Early solo career (1977–1984) ===
Signing a solo contract with Epic Records in 1977, LaBelle recruited David Rubinson, producer of &quot;Chameleon&quot;, to record her self-titled debut album, which was released that year. The album was noted for the disco hits, &quot;Joy to Have Your Love&quot; and &quot;Dan Swit Me&quot; and the gospel ballad, &quot;You Are My Friend&quot;, the latter song becoming her first career-defining single despite its low entry on the R&amp;B chart. Three more albums were released in succession on Epic through 1980 (&quot;Tasty&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Alright with Me&quot;, and &quot;Released&quot;), with the songs &quot;Eyes in the Back of My Head&quot;, &quot;Little Girls&quot;, &quot;Music is My Way of Life&quot;, &quot;Come What May&quot;, &quot;Release (The Tension)&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Go Shopping&quot; (the latter song co-written by Peter Allen) being the most successful.

After four albums on Epic, LaBelle signed with Philadelphia International Records where she recorded a notable version of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; on the album &quot;The Spirit&#x27;s in It&quot;. In 1982, she was featured on the Grover Washington duet &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot;, and earned accolades that year for starring in the Broadway musical &quot;Your Arms Too Short to Box with God&quot;. &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come&quot; later earned LaBelle her first Grammy Award nomination. In 1983, LaBelle released her breakthrough album &quot;I&#x27;m in Love Again&quot; which included her first top ten R&amp;B singles, with &quot;Love, Need and Want You&quot; and &quot;If Only You Knew&quot;, the latter song also becoming her first number-one single as a solo artist in early 1984. Later in 1984, she scored another hit with Bobby Womack on the song &quot;Love Has Finally Come at Last&quot; and made her film debut as Big Mary in the film &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Story&quot;, co-writing two original songs for the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

=== Crossover success (1984–2009) ===

In 1984, LaBelle recorded the songs &quot;New Attitude&quot; and &quot;Stir It Up&quot; for the soundtrack to the Eddie Murphy film, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;. Following the release of the film, &quot;New Attitude&quot; was released as a single in late 1984 and became LaBelle&#x27;s first crossover solo hit, reaching number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming a signature song. &quot;Stir It Up&quot; found similar success on pop radio and as a staple in dance clubs. In 1985, LaBelle performed on the TV special, &quot;Motown Returns to Apollo&quot; and also as part of the all-star benefit concert, &quot;Live Aid&quot;. Her notoriety from performing on the two specials made her a pop star and led to having her own television special later that same year. Also in the same year, a video of a performance from her tour of that year was issued on VHS. During this time, LaBelle ended her contractual obligations to Philadelphia International and signed with MCA Records.

LaBelle shared a stage with Gladys Knight and Dionne Warwick for the 1986 HBO special &quot;Sisters in the Name of Love&quot;. During the same year LaBelle released her bestselling solo album &quot;Winner in You&quot;, which reached number one on the pop charts. The album included the international number-one hit, &quot;On My Own&quot; and the hit ballad &quot;Oh People&quot;. The success of &quot;Winner in You&quot; would prove to be the peak of her solo success, though she continued her acclaim with the 1989 release of &quot;Be Yourself&quot;, which featured the Prince-written and produced &quot;Yo Mister&quot; and the hit ballad &quot;If You Asked Me To&quot;, which had bigger success in a remake by singer Celine Dion. In August, the same year of that album&#x27;s release, LaBelle performed as the Acid Queen for The Who&#x27;s second all-star concert celebrating the 20th anniversary of their rock-opera &quot;Tommy&quot; at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles. Later that same year LaBelle began a successful stint in a recurring role on &quot;A Different World&quot;, the success of which spawned a brief sitcom of her own, titled &quot;Out All Night&quot;, which only lasted a season.

In 1991, she recorded a hit duet version of the Babyface composition, &quot;Superwoman&quot; with Gladys Knight and Dionne Warwick. That same year LaBelle released the solo album, &quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot;, which featured collaborations with Knight, Prince, Michael Bolton, Big Daddy Kane, and Luther Vandross, as well as a reunion with Labelle bandmates Hendryx and Dash on the track &quot;Release Yourself.&quot; &quot;Burnin&quot;&#x27; went gold, with three successive top five singles on the R&amp;B charts. This success led to LaBelle winning her first Grammy Award in the Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance category in the 34th Annual Grammy Award Ceremony of 1992, sharing the win with singer Lisa Fischer, who won for her hit ballad, &quot;How Can I Ease the Pain&quot;, in a rare tie in the history of the Grammys. She was also nominated in the Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal category alongside Knight and Warwick for &quot;Superwoman.&quot;

LaBelle&#x27;s 1994 album, &quot;Gems&quot;, also went gold and featured the hit, &quot;The Right Kinda Lover&quot;. On January 29, 1995, LaBelle performed at the Super Bowl XXIX halftime show, held at the Joe Robbie Stadium (which later became Hard Rock Stadium) in Miami with Tony Bennett, Arturo Sandoval and Miami Sound Machine. LaBelle released the album, &quot;Flame&quot;, which included the dance hit, &quot;When You Talk About Love&quot;. LaBelle released her bestselling memoirs, &quot;Don&#x27;t Block the Blessings&quot;, in 1996, and released the first of five bestselling cookbooks in 1997. In 1998, she released the live album, &quot;Live! One Night Only&quot;, giving her a second Grammy win in February 1999. She was honored with the Triumphant Spirit Award for Career Achievement at the 1998 Essence Awards, featuring tributes from Michael Bolton, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, SWV, and Luther Vandross.

In 2000, LaBelle released her final MCA album, &quot;When a Woman Loves&quot;, before signing with Def Soul Classics to release the 2004 album, &quot;Timeless Journey&quot;. During the promotional run of the album, she headlined &quot;VH1 Divas&quot; for the first time, alongside artists like Debbie Harry and Jessica Simpson and good friends Knight and Cyndi Lauper. After the release of her 2005 covers album, &quot;Classic Moments&quot;, LaBelle was in a rivalry with Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid over the direction of her career, leading to her leaving the label. That same year she collaborated with singer Olivia Newton-John on Newton-John&#x27;s album &quot;Stronger Than Before&quot;.

In the same year, the World Music Awards recognized her years in the music business by awarding her the Legend Award. In 2006, she released her first gospel album, &quot;The Gospel According to Patti LaBelle&quot; on the Bungalo label, the album later peaking at number one on Billboard&#x27;s gospel chart. LaBelle also released the book, &quot;Patti&#x27;s Pearls&quot;, during this period. She returned to Def Jam in 2007 and released her second holiday album, &quot;Miss Patti&#x27;s Christmas&quot;. In 2008, LaBelle briefly reunited with Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash as Labelle on the group&#x27;s first new album in more than 30 years, &quot;Back to Now&quot;.

=== Later career (2010–present) ===
On September 14, 2010, LaBelle made a return two decades after her last Broadway performance to star in the award-winning musical &quot;Fela!&quot; about Afrobeat legend Fela Anikulapo-Kuti. She replaced Tony Award-nominee Lillias White as Fela&#x27;s mother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, and performed with the production through the end of its run on January 2, 2011.

On May 23, 2011, LaBelle appeared on &quot;Oprah&#x27;s Farewell Spectacular, Part 1&quot; the first show in a series of three shows which was the finale of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, singing &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; with Josh Groban. She was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the BET Awards on June 26, 2011. LaBelle and Aretha Franklin, among others, performed at the &quot;Women of Soul: In Performance at the White House&quot; concert hosted by President Barack Obama at the White House, recorded on March 6, 2014.

On June 10, 2014, LaBelle returned to Broadway as the cast and creative team of the Tony Award-nominated smash hit Broadway musical &quot;After Midnight&quot;, welcomed her as &quot;Special Guest Star&quot;. In 2014, she appeared in a guest role on the fourth season of the FX horror anthology television series &quot;American Horror Story&quot; which was subtitled &quot;Freak Show&quot;.

In 2015, LaBelle was one of the celebrities who competed on the 20th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She partnered with professional dancer Artem Chigvintsev. The couple was eliminated on Week 6 and finished in eighth place. She has consistently toured the United States selling out shows in various markets. In 2012 and 2014 she appeared with Frankie Beverly &amp; Maze on cross-country U.S. tours. In 2015 LaBelle made a guest appearance on Fox&#x27;s television series &quot;Empire&quot; as herself.

She appeared as a &quot;key advisor&quot; for &quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; on the tenth season of the NBC series &quot;The Voice&quot;.
She returned to the &quot;VH1 Divas&quot; stage in 2016, headlining a holiday-themed concert alongside Chaka Khan, Vanessa Williams, and her goddaughter Mariah Carey. Her first jazz album, &quot;Bel Hommage&quot;, was released in 2017. In 2018 she began appearing in recurring roles on the television series &quot;Daytime Divas&quot;, &quot;Greenleaf&quot; and &quot;Star&quot;.

On July 2, 2019, LaBelle was honored in Philadelphia with her very own street name &quot;Patti LaBelle Way&quot; between Locust and Spruce Street. On November 20 of the same year, LaBelle was revealed to have competed on the second season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Flower&quot;. LaBelle continued her acting career with roles alongside Cedric the Entertainer on &quot;The Neighborhood&quot; and Dulé Hill on &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;. In September 2020 live from The Fillmore in Philadelphia, LaBelle participated in the American webcast series &quot;Verzuz&quot;, alongside longtime friend Gladys Knight with a surprise appearance by Dionne Warwick.

On December 10, 2022, LaBelle&#x27;s Christmas concert in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was disrupted when a bomb threat resulted in evacuation of the venue. While celebrating her 80th birthday in 2024, LaBelle revealed she was releasing a new album, &quot;8065&quot;, celebrating her 80 years of life and 65 years in music. A few weeks later she announced a tour of the same name, kicking off on July 7 in Los Angeles.

== Charity work, foundations and activism ==
LaBelle has supported numerous charities and foundations. She is strongly committed to peace by promoting access to education, healthcare, housing, employment and equality of justice. She has served on several national boards as a devoted advocate for health causes, including diabetes, AIDS, Alzheimer&#x27;s, and cancer.

In 1987, LaBelle became a spokesperson for the &#x27;National Minority AIDS council&#x27; and promoted the &quot;Live Long, Sugar&quot; campaign to encourage people of color to seek treatment for AIDS. She used her influence to raise awareness around the AIDS crisis and the treatment of gay and lesbian community. She has been a vocal about her support for the LGBT community and has performed at numerous pride events.

== Personal life ==
LaBelle dropped out of Philadelphia&#x27;s John Bartram High School just a semester before graduating in 1962. LaBelle returned to the school in her mid-thirties and later earned her diploma.

LaBelle wrote that she was sexually assaulted by Jackie Wilson while at the Brevoort Theatre in Brooklyn in the 1960s. Around 1964, LaBelle was engaged to Otis Williams, founding member of The Temptations. The engagement lasted a year before Patti broke it off after fearing Williams would force her to move to Detroit and retire from the road.

On July 23, 1969, LaBelle married a longtime friend, Armstead Edwards, who was a schoolteacher. After LaBelle started her solo career, Edwards became her manager, a position he would remain in until 2000. That year, LaBelle and Edwards legally separated, with their divorce finalized in 2003. They have a son, Zuri Kye Edwards (born July 17, 1973), who is now her manager. After Zuri&#x27;s birth, LaBelle suffered from postpartum depression for a year and said singer-songwriter Laura Nyro helped to take care of Zuri while LaBelle recovered. Through Zuri (whose name means &quot;good&quot; in Swahili), LaBelle is a grandmother of two girls and one boy.

LaBelle&#x27;s mother Bertha died in October 1978 from diabetes at the age of 62. Her father, Henry Holte Jr., died of complications from emphysema and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in October 1989 at the age of 70.

All three of LaBelle&#x27;s sisters died young. Her eldest sister, Vivian Hogan Rogers, died of lung cancer in October 1975 at the age of 43. Seven years later, in October 1982, her elder sister Barbara Holte Purifoy died from complications of colon cancer at the age of 40. In July 1989, three months before her father&#x27;s death, LaBelle lost her youngest sister, Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; Holte-Padgett, to brain cancer at the age of 43. A day after the singer buried Padgett, an emotionally-wrecked LaBelle shot the music video to &quot;If You Asked Me To&quot; where she was seen crying in various shots; the video was shot on what would have been Padgett&#x27;s 44th birthday. The singer dedicated her 1991 &quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot; album, and her famous rendition of the song &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; during her concert tour in 1991–92 to Padgett.

LaBelle said that because of her sisters and parents dying &quot;before their time&quot;, she wrote in her autobiography that she feared she would not make it to 50. Once she reached that age, however, the singer said she felt her life &quot;had just begun&quot;. A year later, LaBelle was diagnosed as having diabetes and later became a spokesperson for several organizations dedicated to fighting the disease.

She has a home in the Philadelphia suburb of Wynnewood and also has condos in Los Angeles and in Eleuthera, the Bahamas. LaBelle is an honorary member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

== Civil suits ==
In 2010, LaBelle yelled at a woman and spilled water on her baby; that happened in the lobby of the Trump Place Apartments in Manhattan. LaBelle agreed to a settlement of $100,000 to avoid a trial. The family donated the award to a charity.

In June 2011, a West Point cadet filed a civil suit against LaBelle after he was allegedly assaulted by her bodyguards at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas. LaBelle and her entourage were on their way to a gig in Louisiana when Richard King, a 23-year-old cadet on spring break, was waiting to be picked up in the ride-share area. King alleged that Labelle&#x27;s entourage attacked him, causing a concussion, Labelle&#x27;s entourage said that he had provoked the attack. King lost his court case after five days of testimony. King was suspended from the U.S. Military Academy. He sued LaBelle and Holmes for assault, seeking $1 million in civil court. LaBelle filed a counter-suit. Efrem Holmes, Labelle&#x27;s bodyguard, was acquitted of misdemeanor assault on November 12, 2013, stemming from the incident.

== Pop culture ==
Patti LaBelle has been described as &quot;the greatest gay icon of all time and a prime example of the intersection of the LGBT community and black female artists&quot;. In a 2017 interview, she said: &quot;when I think about it, the gay fans are some of the reason–one big reason–I&#x27;m still standing, &#x27;cause they loved me when other people tried not to. Everybody always says, &quot;What makes gay men like you?&quot; &quot;I have no clue,&quot; I say. I still don&#x27;t. But I know that love has lifted me up for many, many years.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called LaBelle one of three of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Beloved Divas&quot; alongside Dolly Parton and Barbra Streisand.

LaBelle is the primary character on the popular web parody &quot;Got 2B Real&quot;. During the 2010s, her performance of &quot;This Christmas&quot; at the 1996 National Tree Lighting Ceremony broadcast live on C-SPAN began going viral annually during the holiday season due to LaBelle&#x27;s reactions to technical difficulties and other performance challenges. The viral video is referenced in LaBelle&#x27;s &quot;A Black Lady Sketch Show&quot; appearance, including the episode&#x27;s title.

LaBelle made some headlines in late 2015 when James Wright (No Channel), a vlogger spoke enthusiastically on YouTube of her brand of sweet potato pies. The video quickly went viral and for a time, one pie sold every second at Walmart, selling out at stores across the country. She has appeared in two Walmart commercials also an Old Spice commercial.

<text>Madurai ( , , ) formerly known as Madura, is a major city in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is the cultural capital of Tamil Nadu and the administrative headquarters of Madurai District, which is governed by the Madurai Municipal Corporation established on 1 November 1866. As of the 2011 census, it is the third largest metropolis in Tamil Nadu after Chennai and Coimbatore in terms of population and 27th largest urban agglomeration in India. Located on the banks of River Vaigai, Madurai has been a major settlement for two millennia and has a documented history of more than 2500 years. It is often referred to as &quot;Thoongatha Nagaram&quot;, meaning &quot;the city that never sleeps&quot;.

Madurai is closely associated with the Tamil language. The third Tamil Sangam, a major congregation of Tamil scholars, is said to have been held in the city. The recorded history of the city goes back to the 3rd century BCE, being mentioned by Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to the Mauryan Empire, and Kautilya, a minister of the Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya. Signs of human settlements and Roman trade links dating back to 300 BCE are evident from excavations by Archeological Survey of India in Manalur. The city is believed to be of significant antiquity and has been ruled, at different times, by the Pandyan Kingdom, Chola Empire, Madurai Sultanate, Vijayanagar Empire, Madurai Nayaks, Carnatic kingdom, and the British East India Company&#x27;s British Raj. The city has a number of historical monuments, with the Koodal Azhagar temple, Meenakshi Temple and the Thirumalai Nayakkar Mahal being the most prominent.

Madurai is an important industrial and educational hub in South Tamil Nadu. The city is home to various automobile, rubber, chemical and granite manufacturing industries. Madurai has important government educational institutes such as the Madurai Medical College, Homeopathic Medical College, Madurai Law College, Agricultural College and Research Institute and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Madurai. The city covers an area of and had a population of 1,470,755 in 2011. The city is also the seat of a bench of the Madras High Court.

It is one of the few towns and cities in List of AMRUT Smart cities in Tamil Nadu selected for AMRUT Schemes from central government and the developmental activities are taken care by government of Tamil Nadu.

==Etymology==
According to Iravatham Mahadevan, a 2nd-century BCE Tamil-Brahmi inscription refers to the city as &quot;matiray&quot;, an Old Tamil word meaning a &quot;walled city&quot;.

Madurai is one of the many temple towns known as Kadambavanam for its historic temples in India which is named after the groves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The region is believed to have been covered with Kadamba forest and hence called Kadambavanam. The city is referred by various names including &quot;Madurai&quot;, &quot;Koodal&quot;, &quot;Malligai Maanagar&quot;, &quot;Naanmadakoodal&quot; and &quot;Thirualavai&quot;. It is believed that &quot;Madurai&quot; is the derivative of the word &quot;Marutham&quot;, which refers to the type of landscape of the Sangam age. A town in the neighbouring Dindigul district is called Vada Madurai (&quot;North Madurai&quot;) and another in Sivagangai district is called Manamadurai. The different names by which the city has been referred to historically are listed in the 7th-century poem &quot;Thiruvilayaadal Puraanam&quot; written by Paranjothi Munivar. &quot;Vaishnava&quot; texts refer to Madurai as the &quot;southern Mathura&quot;, probably similar to Tenkasi (&quot;southern Kashi&quot;).

&quot;Koodal&quot; means an assembly or congregation of scholarly people, referring to the three Tamil Sangams held at Madurai. Naanmadakoodal, meaning the junction of four towers, refers to the four major temples for which Madurai was known for. The sangam literature mentions the Koodal Azhagar temple at the centre of the city. Historians are of the opinion that Koodal Azhagar temple finds mention in Sangam literature (3rd century BCE–3rd century CE) in works like &quot;Madurai Kanchi&quot; by Mangudi Marudan, &quot;Paripāṭal&quot;, &quot;Kaliththokai&quot; and &quot;Silappatikaram&quot;. &quot;Madurai Kanchi&quot; details the Thiruvonam festival celebrated in the temple. Koodal Azhagar temple is revered in &quot;Nalayira Divya Prabhandam&quot;, the 5th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Periyalvar, Thirumalisai Alvar and Thirumangai Alvar. The temple is classified as a &quot;Divya Desams&quot;, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like &quot;108 Tirupathi Anthathi&quot; by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar and &quot;Koodal Sthala Purana&quot;. &quot;Tevaram&quot;, the 7th- or 8th-century Tamil compositions on Shiva by the three prominent Nayanars (&quot;Saivites&quot;), namely Appar, Sundarar and Thirugnanasambandar, address the city as &quot;Thirualavai&quot;.

==History==

The Buddhist text Mahavamsa mentions Madurai in the context of Prince Vijaya&#x27;s (543–505 BCE) arrival in Sri Lanka with his 700 followers. According to the Mahavamsa, emissaries laden with precious gifts, jewels and pearls, were sent from Sri Lanka to Madurai of ancient Tamilakam. Their mission was to secure a bride for Prince Vijaya. The Pandyan King of Madurai agreed to the proposal. He not only sent his own daughter to marry Prince Vijaya but also requested other families to offer their daughters to marry the prince&#x27;s ministers and retainers. So, along with the Princess and hundreds of maidens, craftsmen and a thousand families from the eighteen guilds were also sent to Sri Lanka.

Madurai has been inhabited since at least the 3rd century BCE. Megasthenes may have visited Madurai during the 3rd century BCE, with the city referred as &quot;Methora&quot; in his accounts. The view is contested by some scholars who believe &quot;Methora&quot; refers to the north Indian city of Mathura, as it was a large and established city in the Mauryan Empire. Madurai is also mentioned in Kautilya&#x27;s (370–283 BCE) &quot;Arthashastra&quot;. Sangam literature like &quot;Maturaikkāñci&quot; records the importance of Madurai as a capital city of the Pandyan dynasty. Madurai is mentioned in the works of Roman historians Pliny the Younger (61 – ), Ptolemy (), those of the Greek geographer Strabo (64/63 BCE – ), and also in Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.
After the Sangam age, most of present-day Tamil Nadu, including Madurai, came under the rule of the Kalabhra dynasty, which was ousted by the Pandyas around 590 CE. The Pandyas were ousted from Madurai by the Chola dynasty during the early 9th century. The city was fought over between the Cholas and the Pandyas during the 12th century, changing hands several times, until the early 13th century, when the second Pandyan empire was established with Madurai as its capital. After the death of Kulasekara Pandian (1268–1308 CE), Madurai came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate. The Madurai Sultanate then seceded from Delhi and functioned as an independent kingdom until its gradual annexation by the Vijayanagara Empire in 1378 CE. Madurai became independent from Vijayanagar in 1559 CE under the Nayaks. Nayak rule ended in 1736 CE and Madurai was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib (1740 – 1754 CE), Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan (1725 – 1764 CE) in the middle of the 18th century.

In 1801, Madurai came under the direct control of the British East India Company and was annexed to the Madras Presidency. The British government made donations to the Meenakshi temple and participated in the Hindu festivals during the early part of their rule. The city evolved as a political and industrial complex through the 19th and 20th centuries to become a district headquarters of a larger Madurai district. In 1837, the fortifications around the temple were demolished by the British. The moat was drained and the debris was used to construct new streets – Veli, Marat and Perumaal Mesthiri streets. The city was constituted as a municipality in 1866 under the Town Improvement Act of 1865. The British government faced initial hiccups during the earlier period of the establishment of municipality in land ceiling and tax collection in Madurai and Dindigul districts under the direct administration of the officers of the government. The city, along with the district, was resurveyed between 1880 and 1885 CE and subsequently, five municipalities were constituted in the two districts and six taluk boards were set up for local administration. Police stations were established in Madurai city, housing the headquarters of the District Superintendent.

It was in Madurai, in 1921, that Mahatma Gandhi, pre-eminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India, first adopted the loin cloth as his mode of dress after seeing agricultural labourers wearing it. Leaders of the independence movement in Madurai included N. M. R. Subbaraman, Karumuttu Thiagarajan Chettiar and Mohammad Ismail Sahib. The Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act passed by the government of Madras Presidency under C. Rajagopalachari in 1939 removed restrictions prohibiting Shanars and Dalits from entering Hindu temples. The temple entry movement was first led in Madurai Meenakshi temple by independence activist A. Vaidyanatha Iyer in 1939.

Madurai is built around the Koodal Azhagar temple and Meenakshi Temple, which acted as the geographic and ritual centre of the ancient city of Madurai. The city is divided into a number of concentric quadrangular streets around the temple. Viswanatha Nayak (1529–64 CE), the first Madurai Nayak king, redesigned the city in accordance with the principles laid out by &quot;Shilpa Shastras&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;&quot;, also anglicised as &quot;silpa sastra&quot; meaning rules of architecture) related to urban planning. These squares retain their traditional names of Aadi, Chittirai, Avani-moola and Masi streets, corresponding to the Tamil month names and also to the festivals associated.

The temple &quot;prakarams&quot; (outer precincts of a temple) and streets accommodate an elaborate festival calendar in which dramatic processions circumambulate the shrines at varying distances from the centre. The temple chariots used in processions are progressively larger in size based on the size of the concentric streets. Ancient Tamil classics record the temple as the centre of the city and the surrounding streets appearing liken a lotus and its petals. The city&#x27;s axes were aligned with the four-quarters of the compass, and the four gateways of the temple provided access to it. The wealthy and higher echelons of the society were placed in streets close to the temple, while the poorest were placed in the fringe streets. With the advent of British rule during the 19th century, Madurai became the headquarters of a large colonial political complex and an industrial town; with urbanisation, the social hierarchical classes became unified.

<text>Coimbatore (Tamil: kōyamputtūr, ), also known as Kovai (), is one of the major metropolitan cities in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located on the banks of the Noyyal River and surrounded by the Western Ghats. Coimbatore is the second largest city in Tamil Nadu after Chennai in terms of population and the 16th largest urban agglomeration in India as per the census 2011. It is the administrative capital of Coimbatore District and is administered by the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation which was established in 1981.

The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during the Sangam period between the 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu. Coimbatore was located along the ancient trade route Rajakesari Peruvazhi that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu in South India. The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu in the 10th century CE. The region was ruled by Vijayanagara Empire in the 15th century followed by the Nayaks who introduced the Palayakkarar system under which Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24 &quot;Palayams&quot;. In the later part of the 18th century, the Coimbatore region came under the Kingdom of Mysore and following the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed Coimbatore to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second Poligar War (1801) when it was the area of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai.

In 1804, Coimbatore was established as the capital of the newly formed Coimbatore district and in 1866, it was accorded municipality status with Robert Stanes as its chairman. The city experienced a textile boom in the early 19th century due to the decline of the cotton industry in Mumbai. Post Independence, Coimbatore has seen rapid growth due to industrialisation and is one of the largest exporters of jewellery, wet grinders, poultry and auto components; the &quot;Coimbatore Wet Grinder&quot; and the &quot;Kovai Cora Cotton&quot; are recognised as Geographical Indications by the Government of India. Being a hub of textile industry in South India, the city is referred to as the &quot;Manchester of South India&quot;.

Coimbatore was ranked the best emerging city in India by India Today in the 2014 annual survey, fourth among Indian cities in investment climate by Confederation of Indian Industry and 17th among the top global outsourcing cities by Tholons. Coimbatore has been selected as one of the Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under the Smart Cities Mission and AMRUT by Government of India. Coimbatore regularly features among the top ten best cities to live in India and is amongst the top three safest cities in India according to National Crime Records Bureau report in 2023.

== Etymology ==
According to one theory, &quot;Coimbatore&quot; is a derivation of (), after chieftain Kovan or Koyan, evolved into and later anglicised as &quot;Coimbatore&quot;. Another theory states that the name could have been derived from . The word evolved from Koyamma, the goddess worshipped by Koyan which became Koniamma and later Kovaiamma.

== History ==
The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between c. 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu. The Kosar tribe mentioned in the 2nd century CE Tamil epic &quot;Silappathikaram&quot; and other poems in Sangam literature is associated with the Coimbatore region. The region was located along an ancient Roman trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu. The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu in the 10th century. A Chola highway called &quot;Rajakesari Peruvazhi&quot; ran through the region. Much of Tamil Nadu came under the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire by the 15th century. In the 1550s, Madurai Nayaks, who were the military governors of the Vijaynagara Empire, took control of the region. After the Vijayanagara Empire fell in the 17th century, the Madurai Nayaks established their state as an independent kingdom. They introduced the Palayakkarar system under which Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24 &quot;Palayams&quot;(towns).

In the latter part of the 18th century, the region came under the Kingdom of Mysore, following a series of wars with the Madurai Nayak dynasty. After the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed Coimbatore to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The Coimbatore region played a prominent role in the Second Poligar War (1801), when it was the area of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai. On 24 November 1804, Coimbatore was established as the capital of the newly formed Coimbatore district and in 1866 it was accorded municipality status. Sir Robert Stanes became the first chairman of the Coimbatore City Council. The region was hard hit during the Great Famine of 1876–78 resulting in nearly 200,000 famine related fatalities. The first three decades of the 20th century saw nearly 20,000 plague-related deaths and acute water shortage.

The decline of the cotton industry in Mumbai fuelled an economic boom in Coimbatore in the 1920s and 1930s. The region played a significant role in the Indian independence movement with Mahatma Gandhi visiting the city three times. Coimbatore was the base of operations for such political figures as S. P. Narasimhalu Naidu, R. K. Shanmukham Chetty, C.S. Rathinasabapathy and C. Subramaniam during the independence movement. Post independence, Coimbatore has seen rapid growth due to industrialisation and in 1981 it was constituted as a municipal corporation. On 14 February 1998, the radical Islamist group Al Ummah bombed 11 places across the city killing 58 people and injuring more than 200.

== Geography ==

Coimbatore lies at in south India at above sea level on the banks of the Noyyal River, in northwestern Tamil Nadu. It covers an area of . It is surrounded by the Western Ghats mountain range to the west and the north, with reserve forests of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve on the northern side. The Noyyal River forms the southern boundary of the city, which has an extensive tank system fed by the river and rainwater. The eight major tanks and wetland areas of Coimbatore are namely, Singanallur, Valankulam, Ukkadam Periyakulam, Selvampathy, Narasampathi, Krishnampathi, Selvachinthamani, and Kumaraswami. Multiple streams drain the waste water from the city.

The city is divided into two distinctive geographic regions: the dry eastern side which includes majority of the urban area of the city and the western region which borders the Nilgiris, Anaimalai and Munnar ranges. Palghat Gap, a mountain pass which connects the neighbouring state of Kerala to Tamil Nadu, lies to the west of the city. Because of its location in the biodiversity hotspot of the Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city is rich in fauna and flora. The Coimbatore urban wetlands harbours around 116 species of birds, of which 66 are resident, 17 are migratory and 33 are local migrants. The spot-billed pelican, painted stork, openbill stork, ibis, Indian spot-billed duck, teal and black-winged stilt visit the Coimbatore wetlands on their migration. Apart from the species common to the plains, various threatened and endangered species such as Indian elephants, wild boars, leopards, Bengal tigers, gaurs, Nilgiri tahr, sloth bear and black-headed oriole are found in the region.

The northern part of the city has a rich tropical evergreen forest with commercially significant trees such as teak, sandalwood, rosewood and bamboo. The soil is predominantly black, which is suitable for cotton cultivation, but some red loamy soil is also found. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, Coimbatore falls under the Class III/IV Seismic Zone, having experienced an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 on the Richter scale on 8 February 1900.

After a warm and foggy September, the north-east monsoon starts from October, lasting until early November. The average annual rainfall is around with the northeast and the southwest monsoons contributing to 47% and 28% respectively to the total rainfall.

<doc id="186100" wikidata="Q336005" url="?curid=186100" title="Arnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle">
<text>Arnold Joost van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle (January 167030 May 1718) was a Dutch States Army officer and nobleman who fought for William III of England and became the first Earl of Albemarle. He had a very close relationship with William and proved a capable cavalry commander. In the latter stages of the War of the Spanish Succession he sometimes assumed Dutch supreme command in absence of Claude Frédéric t&#x27;Serclaes, Count of Tilly.

==Life==
Arnold Joost van Keppel was born in the De Voorst country house near Zutphen in the Dutch Republic. Born in 1670 and was the heir of a junior branch of an ancient and noble family in Gelderland; the son of Oswald van Keppel and his wife Anna Geertruid van Lintelo. De Voorst is a large country house near Zutphen, financed by William III, and not unlike the royal palace Het Loo in Apeldoorn. He achieved fame and wealth as the right-hand man of William III of Orange. He became the page of honour to William III in his mid-teens, possibly as early as 1685. It has been claimed that he was William&#x27;s lover, but no conclusive evidence has been discovered. Keppel accompanied William to England in the Glorious Revolution of 1688.

While some have suggested their association began when Keppel was only 16, others argue a later date, possibly at the time of a hunting accident when he is said to have attracted the king&#x27;s attention by his uncomplaining demeanour upon breaking a leg. Public commentary on the relationship intensified in 1692 when Keppel began to receive grants of land from the king. He became Groom of the Bedchamber and Master of the Robes in 1695. In 1696, he was created the Viscount Bury in Lancashire, and the Baron Ashford of Ashford, Kent. On 10 February 1697, William made Van Keppel the Earl of Albemarle. In 1699, he was awarded the command of the First Life Guards.

In 1700, William gave Albemarle extensive lands in Ireland, but Parliament obliged the king to cancel this grant. William instead granted him £50,000. The same year he was created a Knight of the Garter. He served both with the English and Dutch troops, was a major-general in 1697, colonel of several regiments and governor of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

Handsome and engaging, he rivalled Portland (whose jealousy he aroused in the royal favour), possessed William&#x27;s full confidence, and accompanied him everywhere. In February 1702 William, then prostrated with his last illness, sent Albemarle to the Netherlands to arrange the coming campaign, and he only returned in time to receive William&#x27;s last commissions on his deathbed, including being entrusted with the king&#x27;s private papers.

After the death of William III, who bequeathed to him ƒ200,000 and the lordship of Bredevoort, Albemarle returned to the Netherlands, took his seat as a noble in the States-General, and became a general of cavalry in the Dutch army. He joined the forces of the allies in 1703 in the War of Spanish Succession, was present at the Battle of Ramillies in 1706, and at Oudenaarde in 1708, and distinguished himself at the Siege of Lille. He commanded at the siege of Aire in 1710, led Marlborough&#x27;s second line in 1711, and was general of the Dutch forces in early 1712. As commander of the Dutch forces he successfully bombarded Arras and destroyed much of the French supplies there, but he was defeated at Denain after the withdrawal of Ormonde and the English forces and taken prisoner. He died on 30 May 1718, at the age of forty-eight.

==Family==

Albemarle married Geertruid Johanna Quirina van der Duyn, daughter of Major General Scravenmore (an anglicisation of &#x27;s Gravenmoer) who served as an officer in the Danish Auxiliary Corps in the Williamite War in Ireland.
* William Anne, who succeeded him as 2nd Earl of Albemarle. He married the granddaughter of Charles II of England.
* Sophia (1716–1773), who married General John Thomas (son of Sir Edmond Thomas, 2nd Bt.). They had at least two sons. The younger son, Colonel Charles Nassau Thomas, became Vice-Chamberlain to George IV, when he was Prince of Wales and Prince Regent.

<text>In mathematics, complex geometry is the study of geometric structures and constructions arising out of, or described by, the complex numbers. In particular, complex geometry is concerned with the study of spaces such as complex manifolds and complex algebraic varieties, functions of several complex variables, and holomorphic constructions such as holomorphic vector bundles and coherent sheaves. Application of transcendental methods to algebraic geometry falls in this category, together with more geometric aspects of complex analysis.

Complex geometry sits at the intersection of algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and complex analysis, and uses tools from all three areas. Because of the blend of techniques and ideas from various areas, problems in complex geometry are often more tractable or concrete than in general. For example, the classification of complex manifolds and complex algebraic varieties through the minimal model program and the construction of moduli spaces sets the field apart from differential geometry, where the classification of possible smooth manifolds is a significantly harder problem. Additionally, the extra structure of complex geometry allows, especially in the compact setting, for global analytic results to be proven with great success, including Shing-Tung Yau&#x27;s proof of the Calabi conjecture, the Hitchin–Kobayashi correspondence, the nonabelian Hodge correspondence, and existence results for Kähler–Einstein metrics and constant scalar curvature Kähler metrics. These results often feed back into complex algebraic geometry, and for example recently the classification of Fano manifolds using K-stability has benefited tremendously both from techniques in analysis and in pure birational geometry.

Complex geometry has significant applications to theoretical physics, where it is essential in understanding conformal field theory, string theory, and mirror symmetry. It is often a source of examples in other areas of mathematics, including in representation theory where generalized flag varieties may be studied using complex geometry leading to the Borel–Weil–Bott theorem, or in symplectic geometry, where Kähler manifolds are symplectic, in Riemannian geometry where complex manifolds provide examples of exotic metric structures such as Calabi–Yau manifolds and hyperkähler manifolds, and in gauge theory, where holomorphic vector bundles often admit solutions to important differential equations arising out of physics such as the Yang–Mills equations. Complex geometry additionally is impactful in pure algebraic geometry, where analytic results in the complex setting such as Hodge theory of Kähler manifolds inspire understanding of Hodge structures for varieties and schemes as well as p-adic Hodge theory, deformation theory for complex manifolds inspires understanding of the deformation theory of schemes, and results about the cohomology of complex manifolds inspired the formulation of the Weil conjectures and Grothendieck&#x27;s standard conjectures. On the other hand, results and techniques from many of these fields often feed back into complex geometry, and for example developments in the mathematics of string theory and mirror symmetry have revealed much about the nature of Calabi–Yau manifolds, which string theorists predict should have the structure of Lagrangian fibrations through the SYZ conjecture, and the development of Gromov–Witten theory of symplectic manifolds has led to advances in enumerative geometry of complex varieties.

The Hodge conjecture, one of the millennium prize problems, is a problem in complex geometry.

==Idea==
Broadly, complex geometry is concerned with spaces and geometric objects which are modelled, in some sense, on the complex plane. Features of the complex plane and complex analysis of a single variable, such as an intrinsic notion of orientability (that is, being able to consistently rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise at every point in the complex plane), and the rigidity of holomorphic functions (that is, the existence of a single complex derivative implies complex differentiability to all orders) are seen to manifest in all forms of the study of complex geometry. As an example, every complex manifold is canonically orientable, and a form of Liouville&#x27;s theorem holds on compact complex manifolds or projective complex algebraic varieties.

Complex geometry is different in flavour to what might be called &quot;real&quot; geometry, the study of spaces based around the geometric and analytical properties of the real number line. For example, whereas smooth manifolds admit partitions of unity, collections of smooth functions which can be identically equal to one on some open set, and identically zero elsewhere, complex manifolds admit no such collections of holomorphic functions. Indeed, this is the manifestation of the identity theorem, a typical result in complex analysis of a single variable. In some sense, the novelty of complex geometry may be traced back to this fundamental observation.

It is true that every complex manifold is in particular a real smooth manifold. This is because the complex plane formula_1 is, after forgetting its complex structure, isomorphic to the real plane formula_2. However, complex geometry is not typically seen as a particular sub-field of differential geometry, the study of smooth manifolds. In particular, Serre&#x27;s GAGA theorem says that every projective analytic variety is actually an algebraic variety, and the study of holomorphic data on an analytic variety is equivalent to the study of algebraic data. 

This equivalence indicates that complex geometry is in some sense closer to algebraic geometry than to differential geometry. Another example of this which links back to the nature of the complex plane is that, in complex analysis of a single variable, singularities of meromorphic functions are readily describable. In contrast, the possible singular behaviour of a continuous real-valued function is much more difficult to characterise. As a result of this, one can readily study singular spaces in complex geometry, such as singular complex analytic varieties or singular complex algebraic varieties, whereas in differential geometry the study of singular spaces is often avoided.

In practice, complex geometry sits in the intersection of differential geometry, algebraic geometry, and analysis in several complex variables, and a complex geometer uses tools from all three fields to study complex spaces. Typical directions of interest in complex geometry involve classification of complex spaces, the study of holomorphic objects attached to them (such as holomorphic vector bundles and coherent sheaves), and the intimate relationships between complex geometric objects and other areas of mathematics and physics.

== Definitions ==
Complex geometry is concerned with the study of complex manifolds, and complex algebraic and complex analytic varieties. In this section, these types of spaces are defined and the relationships between them presented.

A complex manifold is a topological space formula_3 such that:
*formula_3 is Hausdorff and second countable.
*formula_3 is locally homeomorphic to an open subset of formula_6 for some formula_7. That is, for every point formula_8, there is an open neighbourhood formula_9 of formula_10 and a homeomorphism formula_11 to an open subset formula_12. Such open sets are called &quot;charts&quot;.
*If formula_13 and formula_14 are any two overlapping charts which map onto open sets formula_15 of formula_6 respectively, then the &quot;transition function&quot; formula_17 is a biholomorphism.
Notice that since every biholomorphism is a diffeomorphism, and formula_6 is isomorphism as a real vector space to formula_19, every complex manifold of dimension formula_7 is in particular a smooth manifold of dimension formula_21, which is always an even number.

In contrast to complex manifolds which are always smooth, complex geometry is also concerned with possibly singular spaces. An affine complex analytic variety is a subset formula_22 such that about each point formula_8, there is an open neighbourhood formula_9 of formula_10 and a collection of finitely many holomorphic functions formula_26 such that formula_27. By convention we also require the set formula_3 to be irreducible. A point formula_8 is &quot;singular&quot; if the Jacobian matrix of the vector of holomorphic functions formula_30 does not have full rank at formula_10, and &quot;non-singular&quot; otherwise. A projective complex analytic variety is a subset formula_32 of complex projective space that is, in the same way, locally given by the zeroes of a finite collection of holomorphic functions on open subsets of formula_33.

One may similarly define an affine complex algebraic variety to be a subset formula_22 which is locally given as the zero set of finitely many polynomials in formula_7 complex variables. To define a projective complex algebraic variety, one requires the subset formula_32 to locally be given by the zero set of finitely many &quot;homogeneous polynomials&quot;.

In order to define a general complex algebraic or complex analytic variety, one requires the notion of a locally ringed space. A complex algebraic/analytic variety is a locally ringed space formula_37 which is locally isomorphic as a locally ringed space to an affine complex algebraic/analytic variety. In the analytic case, one typically allows formula_3 to have a topology that is locally equivalent to the subspace topology due to the identification with open subsets of formula_6, whereas in the algebraic case formula_3 is often equipped with a Zariski topology. Again we also by convention require this locally ringed space to be irreducible.

Since the definition of a singular point is local, the definition given for an affine analytic/algebraic variety applies to the points of any complex analytic or algebraic variety. The set of points of a variety formula_3 which are singular is called the &quot;singular locus&quot;, denoted formula_42, and the complement is the &quot;non-singular&quot; or &quot;smooth locus&quot;, denoted formula_43. We say a complex variety is &quot;smooth&quot; or &quot;non-singular&quot; if it&#x27;s singular locus is empty. That is, if it is equal to its non-singular locus.

By the implicit function theorem for holomorphic functions, every complex manifold is in particular a non-singular complex analytic variety, but is not in general affine or projective. By Serre&#x27;s GAGA theorem, every projective complex analytic variety is actually a projective complex algebraic variety. When a complex variety is non-singular, it is a complex manifold. More generally, the non-singular locus of &quot;any&quot; complex variety is a complex manifold.

== Types of complex spaces ==

=== Kähler manifolds ===
Complex manifolds may be studied from the perspective of differential geometry, whereby they are equipped with extra geometric structures such as a Riemannian metric or symplectic form. In order for this extra structure to be relevant to complex geometry, one should ask for it to be compatible with the complex structure in a suitable sense. A Kähler manifold is a complex manifold with a Riemannian metric and symplectic structure compatible with the complex structure. Every complex submanifold of a Kähler manifold is Kähler, and so in particular every non-singular affine or projective complex variety is Kähler, after restricting the standard Hermitian metric on formula_6 or the Fubini-Study metric on formula_33 respectively.

Other important examples of Kähler manifolds include Riemann surfaces, K3 surfaces, and Calabi–Yau manifolds.

=== Stein manifolds ===
Serre&#x27;s GAGA theorem asserts that projective complex analytic varieties are actually algebraic. Whilst this is not strictly true for affine varieties, there is a class of complex manifolds that act very much like affine complex algebraic varieties, called Stein manifolds. A manifold formula_3 is Stein if it is holomorphically convex and holomorphically separable (see the article on Stein manifolds for the technical definitions). It can be shown however that this is equivalent to formula_3 being a complex submanifold of formula_6 for some formula_7. Another way in which Stein manifolds are similar to affine complex algebraic varieties is that Cartan&#x27;s theorems A and B hold for Stein manifolds.

Examples of Stein manifolds include non-compact Riemann surfaces and non-singular affine complex algebraic varieties.

=== Hyper-Kähler manifolds ===
A special class of complex manifolds is hyper-Kähler manifolds, which are Riemannian manifolds admitting three distinct compatible integrable almost complex structures formula_50 which satisfy the quaternionic relations formula_51. Thus, hyper-Kähler manifolds are Kähler manifolds in three different ways, and subsequently have a rich geometric structure.

Examples of hyper-Kähler manifolds include ALE spaces, K3 surfaces, Higgs bundle moduli spaces, quiver varieties, and many other moduli spaces arising out of gauge theory and representation theory.

=== Calabi–Yau manifolds ===

As mentioned, a particular class of Kähler manifolds is given by Calabi–Yau manifolds. These are given by Kähler manifolds with trivial canonical bundle formula_52. Typically the definition of a Calabi–Yau manifold also requires formula_3 to be compact. In this case Yau&#x27;s proof of the Calabi conjecture implies that formula_3 admits a Kähler metric with vanishing Ricci curvature, and this may be taken as an equivalent definition of Calabi–Yau. 

Calabi–Yau manifolds have found use in string theory and mirror symmetry, where they are used to model the extra 6 dimensions of spacetime in 10-dimensional models of string theory. Examples of Calabi–Yau manifolds are given by elliptic curves, K3 surfaces, and complex Abelian varieties.

=== Complex Fano varieties ===

A complex Fano variety is a complex algebraic variety with ample anti-canonical line bundle (that is, formula_55 is ample). Fano varieties are of considerable interest in complex algebraic geometry, and in particular birational geometry, where they often arise in the minimal model program. Fundamental examples of Fano varieties are given by projective space formula_33 where formula_57, and smooth hypersurfaces of formula_33 of degree less than formula_59.

=== Toric varieties ===
Toric varieties are complex algebraic varieties of dimension formula_7 containing an open dense subset biholomorphic to formula_61, equipped with an action of formula_61 which extends the action on the open dense subset. A toric variety may be described combinatorially by its &quot;toric fan&quot;, and at least when it is non-singular, by a &quot;moment polytope&quot;. This is a polygon in formula_63 with the property that any vertex may be put into the standard form of the vertex of the positive orthant by the action of formula_64. The toric variety can be obtained as a suitable space which fibres over the polytope. 

Many constructions that are performed on toric varieties admit alternate descriptions in terms of the combinatorics and geometry of the moment polytope or its associated toric fan. This makes toric varieties a particularly attractive test case for many constructions in complex geometry. Examples of toric varieties include complex projective spaces, and bundles over them.

== Techniques in complex geometry ==

Due to the rigidity of holomorphic functions and complex manifolds, the techniques typically used to study complex manifolds and complex varieties differ from those used in regular differential geometry, and are closer to techniques used in algebraic geometry. For example, in differential geometry, many problems are approached by taking local constructions and patching them together globally using partitions of unity. Partitions of unity do not exist in complex geometry, and so the problem of when local data may be glued into global data is more subtle. Precisely when local data may be patched together is measured by sheaf cohomology, and sheaves and their cohomology groups are major tools.

For example, famous problems in the analysis of several complex variables preceding the introduction of modern definitions are the Cousin problems, asking precisely when local meromorphic data may be glued to obtain a global meromorphic function. These old problems can be simply solved after the introduction of sheaves and cohomology groups.

Special examples of sheaves used in complex geometry include holomorphic line bundles (and the divisors associated to them), holomorphic vector bundles, and coherent sheaves. Since sheaf cohomology measures obstructions in complex geometry, one technique that is used is to prove vanishing theorems. Examples of vanishing theorems in complex geometry include the Kodaira vanishing theorem for the cohomology of line bundles on compact Kähler manifolds, and Cartan&#x27;s theorems A and B for the cohomology of coherent sheaves on affine complex varieties. 

Complex geometry also makes use of techniques arising out of differential geometry and analysis. For example, the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem, a special case of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, computes the holomorphic Euler characteristic of a holomorphic vector bundle in terms of characteristic classes of the underlying smooth complex vector bundle.

== Classification in complex geometry ==

One major theme in complex geometry is classification. Due to the rigid nature of complex manifolds and varieties, the problem of classifying these spaces is often tractable. Classification in complex and algebraic geometry often occurs through the study of moduli spaces, which themselves are complex manifolds or varieties whose points classify other geometric objects arising in complex geometry.

=== Riemann surfaces ===

The term &quot;moduli&quot; was coined by Bernhard Riemann during his original work on Riemann surfaces. The classification theory is most well-known for compact Riemann surfaces. By the classification of closed oriented surfaces, compact Riemann surfaces come in a countable number of discrete types, measured by their genus formula_65, which is a non-negative integer counting the number of holes in the given compact Riemann surface.

The classification essentially follows from the uniformization theorem, and is as follows:

*&quot;g = 0&quot;: formula_66
*&quot;g = 1&quot;: There is a one-dimensional complex manifold classifying possible compact Riemann surfaces of genus 1, so-called elliptic curves, the modular curve. By the uniformization theorem any elliptic curve may be written as a quotient formula_67 where formula_68 is a complex number with strictly positive imaginary part. The moduli space is given by the quotient of the group formula_69 acting on the upper half plane by Möbius transformations.
*&quot;g &gt; 1&quot;: For each genus greater than one, there is a moduli space formula_70 of genus g compact Riemann surfaces, of dimension formula_71. Similar to the case of elliptic curves, this space may be obtained by a suitable quotient of Siegel upper half-space by the action of the group formula_72.

=== Holomorphic line bundles ===

Complex geometry is concerned not only with complex spaces, but other holomorphic objects attached to them. The classification of holomorphic line bundles on a complex variety formula_3 is given by the Picard variety formula_74 of formula_3.

The picard variety can be easily described in the case where formula_3 is a compact Riemann surface of genus g. Namely, in this case the Picard variety is a disjoint union of complex Abelian varieties, each of which is isomorphic to the Jacobian variety of the curve, classifying divisors of degree zero up to linear equivalence. In differential-geometric terms, these Abelian varieties are complex tori, complex manifolds diffeomorphic to formula_77, possibly with one of many different complex structures.

By the Torelli theorem, a compact Riemann surface is determined by its Jacobian variety, and this demonstrates one reason why the study of structures on complex spaces can be useful, in that it can allow one to solve classify the spaces themselves.

<text>Color management is the process of ensuring consistent and accurate colors across various devices, such as monitors, printers, and cameras. It involves the use of color profiles, which are standardized descriptions of how colors should be displayed or reproduced.

Color management is necessary because different devices have different color capabilities and characteristics. For example, a monitor may display colors differently than a printer can reproduce them. Without color management, the same image may appear differently on different devices, leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies.

To achieve color management, a color profile is created for each device involved in the color workflow. This profile describes the device&#x27;s color capabilities and characteristics, such as its color gamut (range of colors it can display or reproduce) and color temperature. These profiles are then used to translate colors between devices, ensuring consistent and accurate color reproduction.

Color management is particularly important in industries such as graphic design, photography, and printing, where accurate color representation is crucial. It helps to maintain color consistency throughout the entire workflow, from capturing an image to displaying or printing it.

Parts of color management are implemented in the operating system (OS), helper libraries, the application, and devices. The type of color profile that is typically used is called an ICC profile. A cross-platform view of color management is the use of an ICC-compatible color management system. The International Color Consortium (ICC) is an industry consortium that has defined:

* an open standard for a &quot;Color Matching Module&quot; (CMM) at the OS level
* color profiles for:
** devices, including DeviceLink profiles that transform one device profile (color space) to another device profile without passing through an intermediate color space, such as L*A*B*, more accurately preserving color
** &quot;working spaces&quot;, the color spaces in which color data is meant to be manipulated

There are other approaches to color management besides using ICC profiles. This is partly due to history and partly because of other needs than the ICC standard covers. The film and broadcasting industries make use of some of the same concepts, but they frequently rely on more limited boutique solutions. The film industry, for instance, often uses 3D LUTs (lookup table) to represent a complete color transformation for a specific RGB encoding.

At the consumer level, system wide color management is available in most of Apple&#x27;s products (macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS). Microsoft Windows lacks system wide color management and virtually all applications do not employ color management. Windows&#x27; media player API is not color space aware, and if applications want to color manage videos manually, they have to incur significant performance and power consumption penalties. Android supports system wide color management, but most devices ship with color management disabled.

== Overview ==
# Characterize. Every color-managed device requires a personalized table, or &quot;color profile,&quot; which characterizes the color response of that particular device.
# Standardize. Each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors (the &quot;Profile Connection Space&quot;).
# Translate. Color-managed software then uses these standardized profiles to translate color from one device to another. This is usually performed by a color management module (CMM).

==Hardware==

=== Characterization ===

To describe the behavior of various output devices, they must be compared (measured) in relation to a standard color space. Often a step called linearization is performed first, to undo the effect of gamma correction that was done to get the most out of limited 8-bit color paths. Instruments used for measuring device colors include colorimeters and spectrophotometers. As an intermediate result, the device gamut is described in the form of scattered measurement data. The transformation of the scattered measurement data into a more regular form, usable by the application, is called &quot;profiling&quot;. Profiling is a complex process involving mathematics, intense computation, judgment, testing, and iteration. After the profiling is finished, an idealized color description of the device is created. This description is called a &quot;profile&quot;.

===Calibration===

Calibration is like characterization, except that it can include the adjustment of the device, as opposed to just the measurement of the device. Color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as sRGB; when such calibration is done well enough, no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently. This avoidance of the complexity of color management was one of the goals in the development of sRGB.

==Color profiles==
=== Embedding ===
Image formats themselves (such as TIFF, JPEG, PNG, EPS, PDF, and SVG) may contain embedded color profiles but are not required to do so by the image format. The International Color Consortium standard was created to bring various developers and manufacturers together. The ICC standard permits the exchange of output device characteristics and color spaces in the form of metadata. This allows the embedding of color profiles into images as well as storing them in a database or a profile directory.

=== Working spaces ===
Working spaces, such as sRGB, Adobe RGB or ProPhoto are color spaces that facilitate good results while editing. For instance, pixels with equal values of R,G,B should appear neutral. Using a large (gamut) working space will lead to posterization, while using a small working space will lead to clipping. This trade-off is a consideration for the critical image editor.

==Color transformation==
Color transformation, or color space conversion, is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another. This calculation is required whenever data is exchanged inside a color-managed chain and carried out by a Color Matching Module. Transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space. It makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device. By ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see, this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices. Color transformations can be represented by two profiles (source profile and target profile) or by a devicelink profile. In this process there are approximations involved which make sure that the image keeps its important color qualities and also gives an opportunity to control on how the colors are being changed.

=== Profile connection space ===
In the terminology of the International Color Consortium, a translation between two color spaces can go through a &quot;profile connection space&quot; (PCS): Color Space 1 → PCS (CIELAB or CIEXYZ) → Color space 2; conversions into and out of the PCS are each specified by a profile.

=== Gamut mapping ===
In nearly every translation process, we have to deal with the fact that the color gamut of different devices vary in range which makes an accurate reproduction impossible. They therefore need some rearrangement near the borders of the gamut. Some colors must be shifted to the inside of the gamut, as they otherwise cannot be represented on the output device and would simply be clipped. This so-called gamut mismatch occurs for example, when we translate from the RGB color space with a wider gamut into the CMYK color space with a narrower gamut range. In this example, the dark highly saturated purplish-blue color of a typical computer monitor&#x27;s &quot;blue&quot; primary is impossible to print on paper with a typical CMYK printer. The nearest approximation within the printer&#x27;s gamut will be much less saturated. Conversely, an inkjet printer&#x27;s &quot;cyan&quot; primary, a saturated mid-brightness blue, is outside the gamut of a typical computer monitor. The color management system can utilize various methods to achieve desired results and give experienced users control of the gamut mapping behavior.

====Rendering intent====
When the gamut of source color space exceeds that of the destination, saturated colors are liable to become clipped (inaccurately represented), or more formally burned. The color management module can deal with this problem in several ways. The ICC specification includes four different rendering intents, listed below. Before the actual rendering intent is carried out, one can temporarily simulate the rendering by soft proofing. It is a useful tool as it predicts the outcome of the colors and is available as an application in many color management systems:






In practice, photographers almost always use relative or perceptual intent, as for natural images, absolute causes color cast, while saturation produces unnatural colors. If an entire image is in-gamut, relative is perfect, but when there are out of gamut colors, which is preferable depends on a case-by-case basis. CMMs may offer options for BPC and partial chromatic adaptation.

A black point correction (BPC) is not applied for absolute colorimetric or devicelink profiles. For ICCv4, it is always applied to the perceptual intent. ICCv2 sRGB profiles differ among each other in a number of ways, one of which being whether BPC is applied.

== Implementation ==

===Color management module===
&quot;Color matching module&quot; (also -&quot;method&quot; or -&quot;system&quot;) is a software algorithm that adjusts the numerical values that get sent to or received from different devices so that the perceived color they produce remains consistent. The key issue here is how to deal with a color that cannot be reproduced on a certain device in order to show it through a different device as if it were visually the same color, just as when the reproducible color range between color transparencies and printed matters are different. There is no common method for this process, and the performance depends on the capability of each color matching method.

Some well known CMMs are ColorSync, Adobe CMM, Little CMS, and ArgyllCMS.

===Operating system level===
==== Apple ====
Apple&#x27;s classic Mac OS and macOS operating systems have provided OS-level color management APIs since 1993, through ColorSync. macOS has added automatic color management (assuming sRGB for most things) automatically in the OS, but applications can explicitly target other color spaces if they wish to. System wide color management is used in iOS, iPadOS and watchOS as well.

==== Windows ====
Since 1997 color management in Windows is available through an ICC color management system: ICM (Image Color Management).

Beginning with Windows Vista, Microsoft introduced a new color architecture known as WCS (Windows Color System). WCS supplements the ICM system in Windows 2000 and Windows XP, originally written by Heidelberg.

Apps need to be aware of color management and tag the content appropriately to accurately display colors. Otherwise, (unlike macOS) Windows will display the colors to the maximum extent of the display&#x27;s gamut, resulting in over-saturated colors on wide-gamut displays. To fix this issue, Microsoft includes a new feature called &quot;Auto Color Management&quot; since Windows 11 2022.

Windows Photo Viewer from Windows 7 (also included in later Windows versions) performs proper color management, however, the newer Windows Photos app in Windows 8, 10, 11 does not perform color management until version v2022.31070.26005.0. Other Windows components, including Microsoft Paint, Snipping Tool, Windows Desktop, Windows Explorer, do not perform color management.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of applications do not use the Windows Color System. For applications that do employ color management (typically web browsers), color management tend to apply for only images and UI, but not videos. This is because Windows&#x27; media player API is not color space aware. Thus, browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) are only able to do color management for images but not video. For the same reason, virtually no video players on Windows support color management (including the default Movies &amp; TV app and VLC), with Media Player Classic Home Cinema being a rare exception.

==== Android ====
On Android, system wide color management is introduced in Android Oreo 8.1. However, most Android phones are shipped with color management disabled (ex: &#x27;adaptive&#x27; color profile on Google Pixel, &#x27;vivid&#x27; color profile on Samsung Galaxy). This oversaturates sRGB content to the native display gamut, typically DCI-P3. Users need to manually select the &#x27;natural&#x27; color profile to enable color management, enabling accurate display of sRGB and P3 wide color content.

==== Others ====
Operating systems that use the X Window System for graphics can use ICC profiles, and support for color management on Linux, still less mature than on other platforms, is coordinated through OpenICC at freedesktop.org and makes use of LittleCMS.

===File level===
Certain image filetypes (TIFF and Photoshop) include the notion of color channels for specifying the &quot;color mode&quot; of the file. The most commonly used channels are RGB (mainly for display (monitors) but also for some desktop printing) and CMYK (for commercial printing). An additional &quot;alpha&quot; channel may specify a transparency mask value. Some image software (such as Photoshop) perform automatic color separation to maintain color information in CMYK mode using a specified ICC profile such as US Web Coated (SWOP) v2.

=== Creative software ===

Adobe software includes its own color management engine - Adobe Color Engine. It is also available as a separate Color Management Module - Adobe CMM for use by non-Adobe applications that supports 3rd-party CMMs.

===Web browsers===
, most web browsers ignored color profiles. Notable exceptions were Safari, starting with version 2.0, and Firefox starting with version 3. Although disabled by default in Firefox 3.0, ICC v2 and ICC v4 color management could be enabled by using an add-on or setting a configuration option.

As of July 2019, Safari, Chrome and Firefox fully support color management. However, it is important to note that most browsers only do color management for images and CSS elements, but not video. 
* Firefox: version 3.5 (released in 2011) onwards supports ICC v2 tagged images, and version 8.0 (released in 2011) adds ICC v4 profiles support. Version 89 (released in 2021) and above apply color management to all untagged images and page elements by default.
* Internet Explorer: support ICC profiles from version 9 onwards, but only converts non-sRGB images to the sRGB profile, regardless of the actual monitor colorspace.
* Google Chrome: uses the system provided ICC v2 and v4 support on macOS, and from version 22 (released in 2012) supports ICC v2 profiles by default on other platforms. macOS versions of Chrome correctly render video.
* Safari: has support starting with version 2.0 (released in 2005). Supports v2 and v4 ICC profiles, and correctly renders video.
* Opera: has support since 12.10 (released in 2012) for ICC v4.
* Pale Moon supported ICC v2 from its first release, and v4 since Pale Moon 20.2 (released in 2013).

Regarding mobile browsers, Safari 13.1 (on iOS 13.4.1) recognizes the device color profile and can displays images accordingly. Chrome 83 (on Android 9) ignores the display profile, simply converting all images to sRGB.

As of 2023, Chrome 114, Android Browser 114 and Firefox for Android 115 support multiple colorspaces. The same is valid for their desktop counterparts: Chrome 118, Edge 114, Safari 16.6, Firefox 117 and Opera 100.

<text>Badlands National Park () is a national park of the United States in southwestern South Dakota. The park protects of sharply eroded buttes and pinnacles, along with the largest undisturbed mixed grass prairie in the United States. The National Park Service manages the park, with the South Unit being co-managed with the Oglala Lakota tribe.

Located within the White River drainage, the Badlands Wilderness protects of the park&#x27;s North Unit as a designated wilderness area, and is one site where the black-footed ferret, one of the most endangered mammals in the world, was reintroduced to the wild. The South Unit, or Stronghold District, includes sites of 1890s Ghost Dances, a former United States Air Force bomb and gunnery range, and Red Shirt Table, the park&#x27;s highest point at .

Authorized as Badlands National Monument on March 4, 1929, it was not established until January 25, 1939. Badlands was redesignated a national park on November 10, 1978. Under the Mission 66 plan, the Ben Reifel Visitor Center was constructed for the monument in 1957–58. The park also administers the nearby Minuteman Missile National Historic Site. The movies &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (1990) and &quot;Thunderheart&quot; (1992) were partially filmed in Badlands National Park.

This national park was originally a reservation of the Oglala Sioux Indians and spans the southern unit of the park. The area around Stronghold Table was originally Sioux territory, and is revered as a ceremonial sacred site rather than a place to live.

In 1868, at the Second Treaty of Fort Laramie, the United States assured the Sioux that the Badlands shall forever be the property of the Sioux. In 1889, however, the treaty was broken and the Badlands were confiscated by the United States.

At the end of the 19th century, the Sioux Indians used this area as the site of the Ghost Dance, a ceremony to revive the souls of buffalo and the dead. After the last ghost dance in 1890, the United States banned the ritual, but it was revived by the Red Power movement, a movement to restore Indian rights that began in the 1960s. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court awarded compensation to the Sioux for the abrogation of the 1868 treaty, but the Sioux did not accept the money.

==History==
===Native Americans===

For 11,000 years, Native Americans have used this area for their hunting grounds. Long before the Lakota were the paleo-Indians, followed by the Arikara people. Their descendants live today in North Dakota as a part of the Three Affiliated Tribes. Archaeological records combined with oral traditions indicate that these people camped in secluded valleys where fresh water and game were available year-round. Eroding out of the stream banks today are the rocks and charcoal of their campfires, as well as the arrowheads and tools they used to butcher bison, rabbits, and other game. From the top of the Badlands Wall, they could scan the area for enemies and wandering herds. If hunting was good, they might hang on into winter, before retracing their way to their villages along the Missouri River. The Lakota people were the first to call this place &quot;mako sica&quot;, which translates to — literally — &quot;badlands&quot;. Extreme temperatures, lack of water, and the exposed rugged terrain led to this name. French-Canadian fur trappers called it &quot;les mauvaises terres pour traverser,&quot; or &quot;bad lands to travel through.&quot; By one hundred and fifty years ago, the Great Sioux Nation consisting of seven bands including the Oglala Lakota, had displaced the other tribes from the northern prairie.

The next great change came toward the end of the 19th century as homesteaders moved into South Dakota. The U.S. government stripped Native Americans of much of their territory and forced them to live on reservations. In the fall and early winter of 1890, thousands of Native Americans, including many Oglala Sioux, became followers of the Indian prophet Wovoka. His vision called for the native people to dance the Ghost Dance and wear Ghost shirts, which would be impervious to bullets. Wovoka had predicted that the white man would vanish and their hunting grounds would be restored. One of the last known Ghost Dances was conducted on Stronghold Table in the South Unit of Badlands National Park. As winter closed in, the ghost dancers returned to Pine Ridge Agency. The climax of the struggle came in late December 1890. Headed south from the Cheyenne River, a band of Minneconjou Sioux crossed a pass in the Badlands Wall. Pursued by units of the U.S. Army, they were seeking refuge in the Pine Ridge Reservation. The band, led by Chief Spotted Elk, was finally overtaken by the soldiers near Wounded Knee Creek in the Reservation and ordered to camp there overnight. The troops attempted to disarm Big Foot&#x27;s band the next morning. Gunfire erupted. Before it was over, nearly three hundred Indians and thirty soldiers lay dead. The Wounded Knee Massacre was the last major clash between Plains Indians and the U.S. military until the advent of the American Indian Movement in the 1970s, most notably in the 1973 standoff at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.

Wounded Knee is located approximately south of the park on Pine Ridge Reservation. The U.S. government and the Oglala Lakota Nation have agreed that this is a story to be told by the Oglala of Pine Ridge and Minneconjou of Standing Rock Reservation. The interpretation of the site and its tragic events are held as the primary responsibility of these survivors.

===Fossil record===

The history of the White River Badlands as a significant paleontological resource goes back to the traditional Native American knowledge of the area. The Lakota found large fossilized bones, fossilized seashells and turtle shells. They correctly assumed that the area had once been under water, and that the bones belonged to creatures which no longer existed. Paleontological interest in this area began in the 1840s. Trappers and traders regularly traveled the from Fort Pierre to Fort Laramie along a path which skirted the edge of what is now Badlands National Park. Fossils were occasionally collected, and in 1843 a fossilized jaw fragment collected by Alexander Culbertson of the American Fur Company found its way to a physician in St. Louis by the name of Hiram A. Prout.

In 1846, Prout published a paper about the jaw in the &quot;American Journal of Science&quot; in which he stated that it had come from a creature he called a &quot;Paleotherium&quot;. Shortly after the publication, the White River Badlands became popular fossil hunting grounds and, within a couple of decades, numerous new fossil species had been discovered in the White River Badlands. In 1849, Dr. Joseph Leidy published a paper on an Oligocene camel and renamed Prout&#x27;s &quot;Paleotherium&quot;, &quot;Titanotherium prouti&quot;. By 1854 when he published a series of papers about North American fossils, 84 distinct species had been discovered in North America – 77 of which were found in the White River Badlands. In 1870 a Yale professor, O. C. Marsh, visited the region and developed more refined methods of extracting and reassembling fossils into nearly complete skeletons. From 1899 to today, the South Dakota School of Mines has sent people almost every year and remains one of the most active research institutions working in the White River Badlands. Throughout the late 19th century and continuing today, scientists and institutions from all over the world have benefited from the fossil resources of the White River Badlands. The White River Badlands have developed an international reputation as a fossil-rich area. They contain the richest deposits of Oligocene mammals known, providing a glimpse of life in the area 33 million years ago.

===Homesteading===

Aspects of American homesteading began before the end of the American Civil War; however, it did not affect the Badlands until the 20th century. Then, many hopeful farmers traveled to South Dakota from Europe or the eastern United States to try to seek out a living in the area. In 1929, the South Dakota Dept. of Agriculture published an advertisement to lure settlers to the state. On this map they called the Badlands, &quot;The Wonderlands&quot;, promising &quot;...marvelous scenic and recreational advantages&quot;. The standard size for a homestead was . Being in a semi-arid, wind-swept environment, this proved far too little land to support a family. In 1916, in the western Dakotas, the size of a homestead was increased to . Cattle grazed the land, and crops such as winter wheat and hay were cut annually. However, the Great Dust Bowl events of the 1930s, combined with waves of grasshoppers, proved too much for most of the settlers of the Badlands. Houses, built of sod blocks and heated with buffalo chips, were abandoned.

===Military use of Stronghold District===

As part of the World War II effort, the U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) took possession of of land on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home of the Oglala Sioux people, for a gunnery range. Included in this range was from the Badlands National Monument. This land was used extensively from 1942 through 1945 as an air-to-air and air-to-ground gunnery range including both precision and demolition bombing exercises. After the war, portions of the bombing range were used as an artillery range by the South Dakota National Guard. In 1968, most of the range was declared excess property by the USAF. Although were retained by the USAF (but are no longer used) the majority of the land was turned over to the National Park Service.

Firing took place within most of the present-day Stronghold District. Land was bought or leased from individual landowners and the Tribe in order to clear the area of human occupation. Old car bodies and 55 gallon drums painted bright yellow were used as targets. Bulls-eyes across were plowed into the ground and used as targets by bombardiers. Small automatic aircraft called &quot;target drones&quot; and screens dragged behind planes served as mobile targets. Today, the ground is littered with discarded bullet cases and unexploded ordnance.

In the 1940s, 125 families were forcibly relocated from their farms and ranches, including Dewey Beard, a survivor of the Wounded Knee Massacre. Those that remained nearby recall times when they had to dive under tractors while out cutting hay to avoid bombs dropped by planes miles outside of the boundary. In the town of Interior, both a church and the building housing the current post office were struck by six inch (152 mm) shells through the roof. Pilots operating out of Ellsworth Air Force Base near Rapid City found it a real challenge to determine the exact boundaries of the range. There were no civilian casualties. However, at least a dozen flight crew personnel lost their lives in plane crashes.

The Stronghold District also known as the South Unit of Badlands National Park, consists of lands on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation owned by the Oglala Sioux Tribe and managed by the National Park Service under an agreement with the Tribe. The land is a area. Deep draws, high tables and rolling prairie are characteristic of these lands occupied by the earliest plains hunters, the paleo-Indians, and the Lakota Nation.

==Legislative and administrative history==
On March 4, 1929, his final day in office, President Calvin Coolidge signed Public Law No. 1021. This bill authorized creation of the Badlands National Monument in South Dakota. The legislation&#x27;s conditions for eventual proclamation included the acquisition of privately owned land within the proposed boundaries of the monument and the construction of a 30-mile highway through the park. The Badlands National Monument became the seventy-seventh monument within the National Park Service a decade after its original authorization, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the enacting proclamation on January 24. 1939. The 10-year period, 1929–1939, to create the park matched the period of time that Mount Rushmore National Memorial was being blasted and sculptured; the Badlands work was part of a comprehensive federal drive to develop western South Dakota for tourism. The monument was renamed &quot;Badlands National Park&quot; in 1978.

The Badlands National Monument was established in order to preserve the natural scenery and educational resources within its boundaries. The bill authorized specific scientific and educational institutions to excavate within the monument in the pursuit of educational, geological, and zoological observation. The bill includes a portion highlighting the potential for fossil excavation in the monument&#x27;s geological formations.

==Wildlife==
Animals that inhabit the park include: badger, bighorn sheep, bison, black-billed magpie, black-footed ferret, black-tailed prairie dog, bobcat, coyote, elk, mule deer, pronghorn, prairie rattlesnake, porcupine, whooping crane, swift fox, and white-tailed deer.
In 1963, 50 bison from Theodore Roosevelt National Park were released. The herd has grown to over 1,200 animals. The bison habitat was expanded in 2019 by to a total of with the construction of of new fencing. The Bighorn sheep population has increased over the last couple years to a total of 233.

=== Endangered species ===
The black-footed ferret and whooping crane are on the endangered species list. The black-footed ferret population inside the Badlands National Park has recovered to a population of approximately 100 individuals. This whooping crane population in the Badlands National Park is considered a non-self-sustaining wild population.

== Vegetation inventory ==
Twenty-three vegetation map classes and ten Anderson Level II land-use classes were used for interpretation of approximately 1.3 million acres encompassing the park (approximately 242,755 acres) and surrounding environs.

A prairie is a large, open expanse of grasslands. A mixed-grass prairie is a grassland where grasses of many different heights grow. Mixed-grass prairies are the transition between eastern tall-grass prairies, where more rainfall means that taller grasses can grow, and western short-grass prairies, where the dry environment favors shorter grasses. In mixed-grass prairies, such as the grasslands surrounding Badlands National Park, grasses can range in height from ankle-high to waist-high. Although trees, shrubs, and forbs grow in the Badlands, grasses dominate the landscape. The most common grass in the park is Western Wheatgrass, which grows one to three feet tall and is the state grass of South Dakota.

==Visitor services==
Badlands National Park has two campgrounds for overnight visitsCedar Pass and Sage Creek Campgrounds. Cedar Pass lodge offers accommodations in modern cabins and full-service dining. The Ben Reifel Visitor Center within the park offers a bookstore, special programs, and museum exhibits. The White River Visitors center in the park&#x27;s South Unit offers information about the region&#x27;s Lakota heritage.

The Badlands Wilderness covers about one fourth of the park and was designated in 1976. There are no designated trails and camping is permitted anywhere in what is considered to be the largest undisturbed mixed-prairie rangeland remaining in the U.S. As this wilderness is managed by the National Park Service, hunting is not permitted. U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act.

== Climate ==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Badlands National Park has a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;).

==Gallery==
==Current issues and challenges==
Badlands National Park has been impacted by the rise of oil and gas pipelines and drilling, the debate over Native American land rights, fossil loss due to criminal activity, and climate change.

===Oil pipelines/drilling===
Badlands National Park faces growing encroachment from oil and gas companies hoping to transport fossil fuels throughout regions of South Dakota. Pipelines are associated with environmental risks; breaches and or breaks in the system have the potential to negatively impact the quality of life for surrounding ecosystems and wildlife.

===Land rights claims===
The Badlands National Park also faces debate over the federal claims to the land once inhabited by the Oglala Lakota Sioux tribe. Supporters of Oglala Sioux reparations argue against the U.S. government&#x27;s seizure and management over sacred Native American land. The Badlands National Park began taking steps to reserve part of the park&#x27;s southern unit for management by the tribe&#x27;s members, creating jobs and returning ownership to those re-located out during America&#x27;s Manifest Destiny, however this creation of the &quot;Tribal National Park&quot; has yet to come to pass.

===Fossil depletion===
The Badlands National Park was first established as a national monument in order to protect the abundance of fossils within the land&#x27;s natural stone structures. Since the park&#x27;s founding, visitors and fossil poachers have been looting the park&#x27;s fossils to keep for sentimental and scientific value or to sell for profit.

===Climate change===
By 2050, the NPS predicts that Badlands National Park will have different conditions than are currently felt in the park—including increasing or decreasing temperatures, changes in quantity of total spring precipitation, potential delays in the start of spring within the park, and various increasing frequencies of heavy precipitation events. Widespread summer drought is projected to be more likely in South Dakota within the same time frame (2050). On average, the counties of Oglala Lakota, Pennington, and Jackson (the three main counties that the park occupies) have seen a gradual shift of monthly and annual temperatures between 1901 and 2021, leading to a warmer, drier environment.

Current climate predictions developed by the NPS have allowed Badlands National Park to develop several management techniques preparing for different climate scenarios, categorized as &quot;no-gainer&quot;, &quot;no-regrets&quot;, or &quot;no-brainer&quot; management styles. According to the NPS Climate Scenarios brief for the park, a &quot;no-gainer&quot; is a current action that is not likely to achieve desired outcomes in any given future scenario. A &quot;no-regrets&quot; management style implements new actions that are likely to be successful in management of all potential future scenarios. &quot;No-brainer&quot; management involves maintaining current management practices that are likely to be beneficial, but aren&#x27;t necessarily ideal. Climate Change management within the park primarily focuses on native vegetation, bison populations, species rehabilitation, archeological and paleontological preservation, and infrastructure and geohazards. Management plans for these values are primarily under the categories &quot;no-regrets&quot; and &quot;no-brainer&quot;.

<text>Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area is a national recreation area established by an act of Congress on October 15, 1966, following the construction of the Yellowtail Dam by the Bureau of Reclamation. It is one of over 420 sites managed by the U.S. National Park Service. The recreation area spans 120,296.22 acres, straddling the border between Wyoming and Montana. It is divided into two distinct areas, the North District accessed via Fort Smith, Montana and the South District accessed through Lovell, Wyoming. There is no thru road inside the recreation area connecting the two districts. The Yellowtail Dam is located in the North District. It is named after the famous Crow leader Robert Yellowtail, harnesses the waters of the Bighorn River by turning that variable watercourse into Bighorn Lake. The lake extends through Wyoming and Montana, of which lie within the national recreation area. The lake provides recreational boating, fishing, water skiing, kayaking, and birding opportunities to visitors. About one third of the park unit is located on the Crow Indian Reservation. Nearly one-quarter of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range lies within the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Archaeologists have found evidence of people living in the vicinity of Bighorn Canyon for as far back as 12,000 years ago. The Bad Pass trail, along the west side of the canyon, provided passage for Indigenous peoples from Bighorn basin to the Grapevine Creek area. The Grapevine Creek area in present day Montana opened up to the plains, where buffalo could be found. Evidence suggests that people did not live along the trail but used it for seasonal passage or migration.

=== Recent history ===
The Crow peoples, also known as Apsáalooke or Absarokaa, migrated to the region of Bighorn Canyon sometime during the 16th Century. Other peoples migrated through the area as well, but by the 18th century the Crow had settled in the Bighorn country. There were clashes with tribes such as the Blackfeet, Sioux, Cheyenne, and several other tribes over the land. In the late 1800s the Crow aligned themselves with the U.S. Government and were enlisted as scouts. In 1851, the Fort Laramie Treaty (1851) identified 38 million acres of Crow territory. In the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, the Crow territory was diminished to eight million acres. Through the 19th century, as more and more land was ceded to the U.S. Government, Bighorn Canyon remained in the heart of Crow country.

By 1950 the federal government had decided to use the Pick-Sloan Flood Control Act of 1944 to dam the Bighorn River and fill the Bighorn Canyon with water. Members of the Crow Tribe were against the building of the dam because Bighorn Canyon is considered a sacred place. Robert Yellowtail, a leader in the Crow Nation and Superintendent from 1934-1945, fought against the building of the dam. The government wanted 7,000 acres of Crow land and offered $1.5 million to buy it. The Crow valued the land at $5 million. Negotiation ensued and ultimately the government decided to buy 12,000 acres for $5 million. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation then named the 525 foot structure &quot;Yellowtail Dam&quot; after Robert Yellowtail. By this point the Crow reservation was at the almost 2.3 million acres it is today. The Crow reservation surrounds the northern portion of Bighorn Canyon, but the canyon itself is now owned by the United States Government.

On October 29, 1975, the Bad Pass trail was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

== Park management ==
Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area received 217,660 visitors in 2022. It is managed as part of a group of parks referred to as the Powder River group. The group also includes Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, Fort Laramie National Historic Site, and Devils Tower National Monument. This group of parks is in the Intermountain Region of the National Park Service.

=== Visitor centers ===
Yellowtail Dam Visitor Center is located in Fort Smith, Montana in close proximity to the top of Yellowtail Dam. The visitor center is open from Memorial Day to Labor Day. The access road to the Yellowtail Dam Visitor Center is only open during the operating hours of the visitor center. In the South District the Cal S. Taggart Visitor Center is located and Lovell, Wyoming and is open year round. It is closed on Sundays during the fall, winter, and spring.

== Recreation ==

=== Camping and hiking ===
There are seven designated campgrounds in the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area. Four of the campgrounds are drive-in and open year round. The largest is Horseshoe Bend Campground in the South District near Lovell, Wyoming. It has 68 sites. Most of its sites are available on a first come, first serve basis, with the exception of five sites available by online reservation. The Trail Creek/Barry&#x27;s Landing campground is also in the South District with thirty sites. In the North District, the largest campground is Afterbay Campground, consisting of 22 sites. The second drive-in campground in the North District is the Grapevine Campground with fourteen sites. One campground, Medicine Creek, is accessible by boating or hiking in. Medicine Creek Campground has five sites and is located in the South District. The two remaining campgrounds are only accessible by boat and are located in the North District. Black Canyon Campground, with seventeen sites, is located five miles from the Ok-A-Beh Marina. Dayboard 9 Campground has five sites and is approximately nine miles from the Ok-A-Beh Marina.

Backcountry camping is permitted along the reservoir below the high water of 3,640 feet or in undeveloped areas near Bighorn Lake. Fires are not permitted at backcountry campsites. There are two developed waterway campsites located in the canyon at Big Bull Elk Creek and Dry Head Creek.

There are fifteen hiking trails in Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area with a total of approximately seventeen miles of trails. The North District has 3 trails and the South District has twelve trails. The longest trail in the North District is the Beaver Pond Nature trail and is 2.6 miles long. The longest trail in the South District is the Sykes Trail at 4.6 miles long. There are two trails in the recreation area considered handicap accessible, both located in the South District. One handicap trail is the Visitor Center Pond path and is 0.26 miles long. The other is Two Eagles Interpretive Trail and is 0.25 miles long. Pets are permitted on trails in the recreation area but are required to be leashed.

=== Boating ===
Bighorn Lake offers 12,700 surface acres of water for recreation, with 191 miles of shoreline. There are two marinas in the recreation area. Ok-A-Beh Marina is in the North District and Horseshoe Bend Marina is in the South District. Visitors may use motorboats, kayaks, canoes, stand up paddle boards, or most personal watercraft, provided they have the required state inspections and Aquatic Invasive Species decals. Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) inspection stations are intended to keep harmful invasive species such as the Quagga mussel or Zebra mussel out of Montana waters. Boats are also required to display a valid registration.

The National Park Service offers free guided kayaking tours on Bighorn Lake during the summer. Concessionaires offer canoe, kayak, and standup paddle board rentals in the South District. Pontoon rentals are available at Ok-A-Beh Marina.

=== Fishing ===
Prior to the construction of the Yellowtail Dam the Bighorn River was a warm water fishery. Following construction, the waters below the dam transformed into a cold tailwater fishery where rainbow and brown trout spawn. Meanwhile, the reservoir behind the dam supports spawning for smallmouth bass, channel catfish, and ling. Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks stocks the reservoir with walleye and it is managed as a walleye fishery. Largemouth bass, sauger, shovelnose sturgeon, crappie, yellow perch, pumpkinseed, stonecat, and carp are among the fish that may be caught in the reservoir.

Fishing in the Afterbay reservoir is available both by shoreline and by boat. Rainbow trout is the main species of fish caught in Afterbay. For anglers interested in fishing the Bighorn River, there is a boat ramp immediately below Afterbay Dam. In the local town of Fort Smith there are several guiding companies, hunting and fishing lodges, or boat rental companies to service the needs of visiting anglers. Fishing licenses are required when fishing in the National Recreation Area but are issued by the respective states. Anglers are required to have a fishing license for the state they are fishing in.

=== Hunting ===
While hunting is usually not permitted in units managed by the National Park Service, it is permitted in certain areas of Bighorn National Recreation Area. Hunters are required to be knowledgeable of the hunting regulations and strongly encouraged to contact National Park Service rangers in the area prior to hunting. Hunting lodges in Fort Smith offer guides and equipment for hire.

=== Caving ===
The recreation area contains numerous caves. The Bighorn Cavern in particular is used by people interested in caving. Management of Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area requires cavers to obtain a permit at the Cal S. Taggart visitor center in Lovell, Wyoming. Two parties are permitted which must consist of between three and six people. Each party is required to have a member who is familiar with the cave.

== Ecology ==

=== Fauna ===
Bighorn Canyon provides habitat for at least 231 species of birds. Bighorn sheep, black bear, mule deer, mountain lions, pronghorn, coyotes, beavers, and marmots are among the species that live in the varied climates in the recreation area. The black-tailed prairie dog and the swift fox are both listed as Species of Concern by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, &amp; Parks and inhabit the North District of Bighorn Canyon. The gray wolf has been observed in the same region of Wyoming where the South District of Bighorn Canyon is located.

== Climate ==
The North District of Bighorn Canyon is classified as semi-arid and receives an average of 18 inches of rain per year. The South District is a high desert with an annual rainfall of 6 to 10 inches.

==Park features==
Afterbay Lake, located below Yellowtail Dam, is a popular spot for trout fishing as well as for viewing ducks, geese and other animals. The Bighorn River below the Afterbay Dam is likewise a world-class trout fishing area. In addition, the area features many archeological and historical resources. Visitor centers and other developed facilities are located in Fort Smith, Montana, and near Lovell, Wyoming.

Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area has four historic ranches within its boundaries:
* L Slash Heart Ranch was owned by Caroline Lockhart, a notable journalist and novelist in the early 1900s. Two of her books were made into silent films in the 1920s.
* Mason-Lovell Ranch was operating during the open range days of the 1880s; the ranch once had 25,000 cattle roaming the entire Bighorn Basin.
* Cedarvale Ranch, located in the ghost town of Hillsboro, Montana, was a dude ranch owned by native New Yorker Grosvener W. &quot;Doc&quot; Barry, and attracted people for vacations. Visitors included Doc Barry&#x27;s friend President Teddy Roosevelt, but attracting other vacationers proved more difficult.
* Ewing-Snell Ranch is a former family ranch started by Erastus Ewing. Ewing went west to get rich in gold mining, but he was not successful in the gold fields and turned to ranching.

North of Lovell along the Sullivan Knob&#x27;s Trail is one of the national recreation area&#x27;s more unusual claims to fame. There a visitor can stand in a certain spot on the canyon rim, shout across the canyon and then hear a &quot;triple echo&quot; in reply.
