<text>Balkanization or Balkanisation is the process involving the fragmentation of an area, country, or region into multiple smaller and hostile units. It is usually caused by differences in ethnicity, culture, religion, and geopolitical interests.

The term was first coined in the early 20th century, and found its roots in the depiction of events during the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918), specifically referring to incidents that transpired earlier in the Balkan Peninsula.

The term is pejorative; when sponsored or encouraged by a sovereign third party, it has been used as an accusation against such third-party nations. Controversially, the term is often used by opponents of secessionism to highlight potential dangers. The Balkan peninsula is seen as an example of shatter belts in geopolitics.

== Origins of the term ==
Coined in the early 20th century, the term &quot;Balkanization&quot; traces its origins to the depiction of events during the Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and the First World War (1914–1918). It did not emerge during the gradual secession of Balkan nations from the Ottoman Empire over the 19th century, but was coined at the end of the First World War. Albania was the only addition to the existing Balkan map at that time, as other nations had already formed in the nineteenth century. The term was initially employed by journalists and politicians, who used it as a conceptual tool to interpret the evolving global order resulting from the collapse of the Habsburg and Romanov Empires and the subsequent secession of Balkan nations following the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s disintegration in the nineteenth century. After the Second World War (1939–1945), the term underwent significant development, expanding beyond its original context to encompass diverse fields such as linguistics, demography, information technology, gastronomy, and more. This expansion extended its descriptive reach to various phenomena, often with pejorative connotations. In response, critical scholars in the late 20th and early 21st centuries sought to denaturalize and reclaim &#x27;balkanization&#x27;.

==Nations and societies==

The term (coined in the early 20th century in the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire) refers to the division of the Balkan peninsula, which was ruled almost entirely by the Ottoman Empire, into a number of smaller states between 1817 and 1912. It came into common use in the immediate aftermath of the First World War, with reference to the many new states that arose from the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire.

==Uses to stir opinion==

Countries in Europe, where uniting quite recently historically distinct peoples or nations, have seen outspoken separatists. These have prompted reactionary voices fearing Balkanization. The Iberian Peninsula, especially Spain, has from the time of Al-Andalus (ending in 1492) seen voices fearing disorderly rupture. Its main separatist movements today are Basque separatism and Catalan independentism.

Canada is a stable country but has separatist movements, the strongest of which is the Quebec sovereignty movement, which seeks to create a nation-state in Quebec, which encompasses the majority of Canada&#x27;s French Canadian population. Two referendums have been held to decide the question, one in 1980 and one in 1995. Both were lost by the separatists, the latter by a small margin. Less mainstream and smaller movements also exist in the Canadian Prairie, especially Alberta, to protest what is seen as domination by Quebec and Ontario of Canadian politics. Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow also considered separation from Canada if the 1995 referendum had succeeded, which would have led to the balkanization of Canada.

Quebec has been the scene of a small but vociferous partition movement from the part of Anglo-Quebecers activist groups opposed to the idea of independence of Quebec since 80% of the province is francophone. One such project is the Proposal for the Province of Montreal for the establishment of a separate province from Quebec for Montreal&#x27;s strongly-anglophone and allophone (mother tongue neither English nor French) communities.

In January 2007, the growing support for Scottish independence made Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom and later Prime Minister Gordon Brown talk of a &quot;Balkanisation of Britain&quot;. Independence movements in the United Kingdom also exist in England, Cornwall and Northern England (themselves parts of England), Wales, and Northern Ireland.

==In Africa==

Bates, Coatsworth &amp; Williamson argued Balkanization was observed greatly in West Africa then British East Africa. In the 1960s, countries in the started to opt for &quot;autonomy within the French community&quot; in the postcolonial era. Countries in the CFA franc zone were allowed to impose tariffs, regulate trade and manage transport services.

Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Uganda and Tanzania achieved independence toward the end of when the Great Powers postcolonial era came about. The period also saw the breakdown of the Federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland as well as the East African High Commission. Splintering into today&#x27;s nations was a result of the movement towards a closed economy. Countries were adopting antitrade and anti-market policies. Tariff rates were 15% higher than in OECD countries during the 1970s and 1980s. Furthermore, countries took approaches to subsidise their own local industries, but the interior markets were small in scale. Transport networks were fragmented; regulations on labor and capital flow were increased; price controls were introduced. Between 1960 and 1990, balkanization led to disastrous results. The GDP of these regions were one tenth of OECD countries. Balkanization also resulted in what van de Valle called &quot;typically fairly overvalued exchanged rates&quot; in Africa. Balkanization contributed to what Bates, Coatsworth &amp; Williamson claimed to be a lost decade in Africa.

Economic stagnation ended only in the mid-1990s. Countries within the region started to input more stabilization policies. What was originally a high exchange rate eventually fell to a more reasonable exchange rate after devaluations in 1994. By 1994, the number of countries with an exchange rate 50 percent higher than the official exchange rate had decreased from 18 to four. However, there is still limited progress in improving trade policies within the region, according to van de Walle. In addition, the post-independent countries still rely heavily on donors for development plans. Balkanization still has an impact on today&#x27;s Africa. However, this causation narrative is not popular in many circles.

==In the Levant==
During the 1980s, the Lebanese academic and writer Georges Corm used the term &quot;balkanization&quot; to describe attempts by supporters of Israel to create buffer states based on ethnic backgrounds in the Levant to protect Israeli sovereignty. In 2013 the French journalist Bernard Guetta writing in the &quot;Libération&quot; newspaper applied the term to:

*Lebanon&#x27;s political division between Muslims, Christians and Druze.
*The Syrian Civil War.

<text>JARING (Jaring Communications Sdn Bhd) was a Malaysian internet service provider based in Technology Park Malaysia (TPM). It was the first Internet service provider in the country and was formerly owned by MIMOS Berhad.

The word &quot;JARING&quot; was derived from &quot;Joint Advanced Research Integrated Networking&quot;.

JARING underwent liquidation on 23 April 2015 and is no longer in business.

==History==
JARING was Malaysia&#x27;s first and pioneer Internet access service provider.

JARING was commercialised in 1992 after installing its first international satellite leased-circuit at 64kps, connecting Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia to Stockton in the United States. The circuit had then enabled JARING network users to be linked directly with Internet, including the BITNET and NSFNet.

In June 1997, JARING became the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in South East Asia to install the T3 (45 Mbit/s) line, which provided JARING users with faster access to the Internet.

In 1999, JARING went a step further by introducing SuperJARING Internet backbone infrastructure with 2.5 Gigabits per second transmission speed, making it the fastest and longest (841 km) IP-over-fibre backbone service available in the world then.

The SuperJARING infrastructure that runs across Peninsular Malaysia from Kuala Lumpur through Ipoh, Penang, Kulim, Johor Bahru, Melaka and back to Kuala Lumpur has the capability to provide next-generation, bandwidth-intensive services like video-on-demand, secure virtual private networks (Secure VPNs), Internet telephony, Internet TV, distance learning and telemedicine.

As a pioneer in providing Internet access in Malaysia, JARING was committed in exploring new technologies and setting standards for others to follow in order to facilitate the creation of a knowledge-based society. Up until its closure, JARING had multiples of 622 Mbit/s links (STM4) to the global Internet, providing highly redundant circuits riding on the latest APCN-2, FLAG and PACNET submarine cable systems.

JARING Communications Sdn. Bhd. was later established as a spin-off company under MIMOS Berhad on 1 April 2005 and by December 2006, the Ministry of Finance, Malaysia, officially takes over JARING from MIMOS Berhad.

In 2008, JARING is first again to implement Internet telephone interconnect with traditional telephone services allowing Celcom subscribers to directly dial to JARING MY015 telephone subscribers. The Interconnect was later expanded to other telecommunications providers such as Maxis, Telekom Malaysia, TIME, Packet One and DiGi.

In February 2009, JARING was awarded &quot;The International Customer Service Standard (TICSS)&quot; Certification by the British Standards Institution (BSI), United Kingdom. JARING is the first telecommunication company in Malaysia and the Asia-Pacific to receive this award.

JARING had strategically committed its resources in embarking on an initiative to pursue the globally recognised certifications in Information Security Management System. On 20 July 2011, SIRIM QAS International formally awarded the ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 9001 certifications for JARING Internet Data Centre, Virtual Private Network and System Operations.

On 1 January 2013, JARING becomes a private entity under Utusan Printcorp Sdn. Bhd. (UPSB) when the latter took over 100% of the withholding of the company from Ministry of Finance.

Up until its closure, it had ventured into expanding Malaysia&#x27;s Internet experience by becoming among the first to provide high performance computing over the cloud, big data analysis, integrated solution for Internet of Things (IoT) and sentiment analytic for data processing.

JARING has finally closed and undergoes liquidation as of 23 April 2015.

==Milestones==

JARING has distinctly positions itself to be firsts in the Internet industry and its evolving technologies and applications in Malaysia. Among JARING accomplishments are:

*1992: Pioneered the Internet gateway in Malaysia establishing itself as the first Internet Service Provider (ISP).

*1999: The launch of SuperJARING Internet backbone that runs from North to South of Peninsular Malaysia at a speed of 2.5 Gigabits per second, establishing it the first, fastest and longest (841 km) IP-over-fiber backbone service in the world at that time.

*1999: JARING was the first ISP to be awarded the Cisco Powered Network Certification. This certification is recognized to be of international standard that identifies JARING as a reliable provider with a high-performance secured network.

*2000: The first broadband Internet service based on IP-over-Optical Fibre was introduced and catered for business entities at 8 Mbit/s, 34 Mbit/s and 155 Mbit/s.

*2001: The state-of-the art Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) was offered for the first time to secure the performance of the Virtual Private Network (VPN).

*2001–2003: Voted the best ISP under the Consumer Satisfaction Survey for three consecutive years by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC).

*2006: In December JARING Communications Sdn Bhd becomes another arm under the Ministry of Finance of Malaysia.

*2014: High Growth Partner of the year by Southeast Asia and India Trend Micro Incorporated.

*2014: Trend Micro Gold Partner by Southeast Asia and India Trend Micro Incorporated.

*2015: JARING ceased operations.

<text>Adelbert von Chamisso (; 30 January 1781 – 21 August 1838) was a German poet, writer and botanist. He was commonly known in French as Adelbert de Chamisso (or Chamissot) de Boncourt, a name referring to the family estate at Boncourt.

== Life ==
The son of Louis Marie, Count of Chamisso, by his marriage to Anne Marie Gargam, Chamisso began life as Louis Charles Adélaïde de Chamissot at the &quot;château&quot; of Boncourt at Ante, in Champagne, France, the ancestral seat of his family. His name appears in several forms, one of the most common being &quot;Ludolf Karl Adelbert von Chamisso.&quot;

In 1790, the French Revolution drove his parents out of France with their seven children, and they went successively to Liège, the Hague, Würzburg, and Bayreuth, and possibly Hamburg, before settling in Berlin. There, in 1796, the young Chamisso was fortunate in obtaining the post of page-in-waiting to the queen of Prussia, and in 1798 he entered a Prussian infantry regiment as an ensign to train for a career as an army officer.
Shortly thereafter, thanks to the Peace of Tilsit, his family was able to return to France, but Chamisso remained in Prussia and continued his military career. He had little formal education, although he is a noted alumnus of the French Highschool of Berlin (Französisches Gymnasium), that has existed since 1689 for the express purpose of accommodating the children of exiled French nobles. While in the Prussian military service in Berlin he assiduously studied natural science for three years. In collaboration with Varnhagen von Ense, in 1803 he founded the &quot;Berliner Musenalmanach&quot;, the publication in which his first verses appeared. The enterprise was a failure, and, interrupted by the Napoleonic wars, it came to an end in 1806. It brought him, however, to the notice of many of the literary celebrities of the day and established his reputation as a rising poet.

Chamisso had become a lieutenant in 1801, and in 1805 he accompanied his regiment to Hamelin, where he shared in the humiliation of the town&#x27;s capitulation the next year. Placed on parole, he went to France, but both his parents were dead; returning to Berlin in the autumn of 1807, he obtained his release from the Prussian service early the following year. Homeless and without a profession, disillusioned and despondent, Chamisso lived in Berlin until 1810, when through the services of an old friend of the family he was offered a professorship at the &quot;lycée&quot; at Napoléonville in the Vendée.

He set out to take up the post, but instead joined the circle of Madame de Staël, and followed her in her exile to Coppet in Switzerland, where, devoting himself to botanical research, he remained nearly two years. In 1812 he returned to Berlin, where he continued his scientific studies. In the summer of the eventful year, 1813, he wrote the prose narrative &quot;Peter Schlemihl, the man who sold his shadow&quot;. This, the most famous of all his works, has been translated into most European languages (English by William Howitt). It was written partly to divert his own thoughts and partly to amuse the children of his friend Julius Eduard Hitzig.

In 1815, Chamisso was appointed botanist to the Russian ship &quot;Rurik&quot;, fitted out at the expense of Count Nikolay Rumyantsev, which Otto von Kotzebue (son of August von Kotzebue) commanded on a scientific voyage round the world. He collected at the Cape of Good Hope in January 1818 in the company of Krebs, Mund and Maire. His diary of the expedition (&quot;Tagebuch&quot;, 1821) is a fascinating account of the expedition to the Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea. During this trip Chamisso described a number of new species found in what is now the San Francisco Bay Area. Several of these, including the California poppy, &quot;Eschscholzia californica&quot;, were named after his friend Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, the Rurik&#x27;s entomologist. In return, Eschscholtz named a variety of plants, including the genus &quot;Camissonia&quot;, after Chamisso. On his return in 1818 he was made custodian of the botanical gardens in Berlin, and was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences, and in 1819 he married his friend Hitzig&#x27;s foster daughter Antonie Piaste (1800–1837). He became a leading member of the Serapion Brethren, a literary circle around E. T. A. Hoffmann.

In 1827, partly for the purpose of rebutting the charges brought against him by Kotzebue, he published &quot;Views and Remarks on a Voyage of Discovery&quot;, and &quot;Description of a Voyage Round the World&quot;. Both works display great accuracy and industry. His last scientific labor was a tract on the Hawaiian language. Chamisso&#x27;s travels and scientific researches restrained for a while the full development of his poetical talent, and it was not until his forty-eighth year that he turned back to literature. In 1829, in collaboration with Gustav Schwab, and from 1832 in conjunction with Franz von Gaudy, he brought out the &quot;Deutscher Musenalmanach&quot;, in which his later poems were mainly published.

Chamisso died in Berlin at the age of 57. His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof III&quot; (Cemetery No. 3 of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and the New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, to the south of the Hallesches Tor.

Chamisso collected numerous zoological and botanical specimens as well as occasional human bones. His collections are in the care of a number of European museums.

== Botanical work ==
Chamisso is chiefly remembered for his work as a botanist; his most important contribution, done in conjunction with Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal, was the description of many of the most important trees of Mexico in 1830–1831. Also, his &quot;Bemerkungen und Ansichten&quot;, published in an incomplete form in Kotzebue&#x27;s &quot;Entdeckungsreise&quot; (Weimar, 1821) and more completely in Chamisso&#x27;s Collected Works (1836), and the botanical work, &quot;Übersicht der nutzbarsten und schädlichsten Gewächse in Norddeutschland&quot; (Review of the Most Useful and the Most Noxious Plants of North Germany, with Remarks on Scientific Botany), of 1829, are esteemed for their careful treatment of their subjects. In 1824 he became a member of the Regensburg Botanical Society. 

The genera &quot;Chamissoa&quot; Kunth (Amaranthaceae) and &quot;Camissonia&quot; Link (Onagraceae) and many species were named in his honor.
== Belles-lettres ==
Chamisso&#x27;s earliest writings, which include a verse translation of the tragedy &quot;Le Comte de Comminge&quot; in which &quot;heilsam&quot; is used in place of &quot;heilig&quot;, show a 20-year-old still struggling to master his new language, and a number of his early poems are in French. Between 1801 and 1804 he became closely associated with other writers and edited their journal.

As a poet Chamisso&#x27;s reputation stands high. &quot;Frauenliebe und -leben&quot; (1830), a cycle of lyrical poems which was set to music by Robert Schumann, by Carl Loewe, and by Franz Paul Lachner, is particularly famous. Composers such as Pauline Volkstein also used Chamisso’s texts in their compositions. Also noteworthy are &quot;Schloss Boncourt&quot; and &quot;Salas y Gomez&quot;. He often deals with gloomy or repulsive subjects; and even in his lighter and gayer productions there is an undertone of sadness or of satire. In the lyrical expression of the domestic emotions he displays a fine felicity, and he knew how to treat with true feeling a tale of love or vengeance. &quot;Die Löwenbraut&quot; may be taken as a sample of his weird and powerful simplicity; and &quot;Vergeltung&quot; is remarkable for a pitiless precision of treatment. The first collected edition of Chamisso&#x27;s works was edited by Hitzig and published in six volumes in 1836.

== Legacy ==
Otto von Kotzebue named Chamisso Island after him. Chamisso is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Chilean snake, &quot;Philodryas chamissonis&quot;.

== Literary work ==
He is the author of the famous story, &quot;Peter Schlemihl&quot;, about a man who sold his shadow, and is the poet of the short poem &quot;Tragic Story&quot; which tells about a wise monk without the benefit of common sense who tries to change the direction of his pigtail.

<doc id="183593" wikidata="Q21946200" url="?curid=183593" title="Timeline of the universe">
<text>The timeline of the universe begins with the Big Bang, 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago, and follows the formation and subsequent evolution of the Universe up to the present day.
Each &quot;era&quot; or &quot;age&quot; of the universe begins with an &quot;epoch&quot;, a time of significant change. Times on this list are relative to the moment of the Big Bang.

== First 20 minutes ==
=== Planck epoch ===
* c. 0 seconds (13.799 ± 0.021 Gya): Planck epoch begins: Big Bang occurs in which ordinary space and time develop out of a primeval state described by a quantum theory of gravity or &quot;Theory of everything&quot;. All matter and energy of the universe is contained in a hot, dense point (gravitational singularity)

=== Grand unification epoch ===
* c. 10−43 seconds: Gravity separates and begins operating on the universe—the remaining fundamental forces stabilize into the electronuclear force, also known as the Grand Unified Force or Grand Unified Theory (GUT), mediated by (the hypothetical) X and Y bosons which allow early matter at this stage to fluctuate between baryon and lepton states.

=== Inflation ===
* c. 10−35 seconds: inflation, expands the universe by a factor of the order of 1026 over a time of the order of 10−33 to 10−32 seconds. The universe is supercooled from about 1027 down to 1022 kelvin. 
* c. 10−32 seconds: Cosmic inflation ends. The familiar elementary particles now form as a soup of hot ionized gas called quark–gluon plasma;

=== Quark epoch ===
* c. 10−12 seconds: Electroweak phase transition: The weak nuclear force is now a short-range force as it separates from electromagnetic force, so matter particles can acquire mass and interact with the Higgs Field. The quark–gluon plasma persists (Quark epoch). The universe cools to 1015 kelvin.

=== Quark-hadron transition ===
* c. 10−6 seconds: As the universe cools to about 1010 kelvin, a quark-hadron transition takes place in which quarks become confined in more complex particles—hadrons.

=== Lepton epoch ===
* c. 1 second: Lepton epoch begins: The universe cools to 109 kelvin. At this temperature, the hadrons and antihadrons annihilate each other, leaving behind leptons and antileptons – possible disappearance of antiquarks. Gravity governs the expansion of the universe: neutrinos decouple from matter creating a cosmic neutrino background.

=== Photon epoch ===
* c. 10 seconds: Photon epoch begins: Most leptons and antileptons annihilate each other. As electrons and positrons annihilate, a small number of unmatched electrons are left over – disappearance of the positrons.
* c. 10 seconds: Universe dominated by photons of radiation – ordinary matter particles are coupled to light and radiation. 
* c. 3 minutes: Primordial nucleosynthesis: nuclear fusion begins as lithium and heavy hydrogen (deuterium) and helium nuclei form from protons and neutrons.
* c. 20 minutes: Primordial nucleosynthesis ceases

== Matter era ==

=== Matter and radiation equivalence ===
* c. 47,000 years (&quot;z&quot; = 3600): Matter and radiation equivalence
* c. 70,000 years: As the temperature falls, gravity overcomes pressure allowing first aggregates of matter to form.

===Cosmic Dark Age===
* c. 370,000 years (&quot;z&quot; = 1,100): The &quot;Dark Ages&quot; is the period between decoupling, when the universe first becomes transparent, until the formation of the first stars. Recombination: electrons combine with nuclei to form atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium. Ordinary matter particles decouple from radiation. The photons present during the decoupling are the same photons seen in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.
* c. 10–17 million years: The &quot;Dark Ages&quot; span a period during which the temperature of cosmic microwave background radiation cooled from some down to about .

=== Reionization ===
* c. 100 million years: Gravitational collapse: ordinary matter particles fall into the structures created by dark matter. Reionization begins: smaller (stars) and larger non-linear structures (quasars) begin to take shape – their ultraviolet light ionizes remaining neutral gas.
* 200–300 million years: First stars begin to shine: Because many are Population III stars (some Population II stars are accounted for at this time) they are much bigger and hotter and their life cycle is fairly short. Unlike later generations of stars, these stars are metal free. Reionization begins, with the absorption of certain wavelengths of light by neutral hydrogen creating Gunn–Peterson troughs. The resulting ionized gas (especially free electrons) in the intergalactic medium causes some scattering of light, but with much lower opacity than before recombination due the expansion of the universe and clumping of gas into galaxies.
* 200 million years: The oldest-known star (confirmed) – SMSS J031300.36−670839.3, forms.
* 300 million years: First large-scale astronomical objects, protogalaxies and quasars may have begun forming. As Population III stars continue to burn, stellar nucleosynthesis operates – stars burn mainly by fusing hydrogen to produce more helium in what is referred to as the main sequence. Over time these stars are forced to fuse helium to produce carbon, oxygen, silicon and other heavy elements up to iron on the periodic table. These elements, when seeded into neighbouring gas clouds by supernova, will lead to the formation of more Population II stars (metal poor) and gas giants.
* 320 million years (&quot;z&quot; = 13.3): HD1, the oldest-known spectroscopically-confirmed galaxy, forms.
* 380 million years: UDFj-39546284 forms, current record holder for unconfirmed oldest-known quasar.
* 600 million years: HE 1523-0901, the oldest star found producing neutron capture elements forms, marking a new point in ability to detect stars with a telescope.
* 630 million years (&quot;z&quot; = 8.2): GRB 090423, the oldest gamma-ray burst recorded suggests that supernovas may have happened very early on in the evolution of the Universe

=== Galaxy epoch ===

* &lt; 1 billion years, (13 Gya): first stars in the central bar portion of the Milky Way are born,
* 2.6 billion years (11 Gya): first stars in the thick disk region of the Milky Way are formed.
* 4 billion years (10 Gya): Gaia Enceladus merges into Milky Way. 
* 5 or 6 billion years, (8 or 9 Gya): first stars in the thin disk region of the Milky Way are formed.

=== Acceleration ===
* 8.8 billion years (5 Gya, &quot;z&quot; = 0.5): Acceleration: dark-energy dominated era begins, following the matter-dominated era during which cosmic expansion was slowing down.
== Epochs of the formation of the Solar System ==
* 9.2 billion years (4.6–4.57 Gya): Primal supernova, possibly triggers the formation of The Solar System.
* 9.2318 billion years (4.5682 Gya): Sun forms – Planetary nebula begins accretion of planets.
* 9.23283 billion years (4.56717–4.55717 Gya): Four Jovian planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) evolve around the Sun.
* 9.257 billion years (4.543–4.5 Gya): Solar System of Eight planets, four terrestrial (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) evolve around the Sun. Because of accretion many smaller planets form orbits around the proto-Sun some with conflicting orbits – early heavy bombardment begins. A large planetoid strikes Mercury, stripping it of outer envelope of original crust and mantle, leaving the planet&#x27;s core exposed – Mercury&#x27;s iron content is notably high.
* 9.266 billion years (4.533 Gya): Formation of Earth-Moon system following giant impact by hypothetical planetoid Theia (planet). Moon&#x27;s gravitational pull helps stabilize Earth&#x27;s fluctuating axis of rotation.
* 9.271 billion years (4.529 Gya): Major collision with a pluto-sized planetoid establishes the Martian dichotomy on Mars
* 9.3 billion years (4.5 Gya): Sun becomes a main sequence yellow star: formation of the Oort cloud and Kuiper belt 
* 9.396 billion years (4.404 Gya): Liquid water may have existed on the surface of the Earth
* 9.7 billion years (4.1 Gya): Resonance in Jupiter and Saturn&#x27;s orbits moves Neptune out into the Kuiper belt causing a disruption among asteroids and comets there. As a result, Late Heavy Bombardment batters the inner Solar System. Meteorite impact creates the Hellas Planitia on Mars, the largest unambiguous structure on the planet.
* 10.4 billion years (3.5 Gya): Earliest fossil traces of life on Earth (stromatolites)
* 10.6 billion years (3.2 Gya): Martian climate thins to its present density: groundwater stored in upper crust (megaregolith) begins to freeze, forming thick cryosphere overlying deeper zone of liquid water – dry ices composed of frozen carbon dioxide form 
* 10.8 billion years (3 Gya): Beethoven Basin forms on Mercury – unlike many basins of similar size on the Moon, Beethoven is not multi ringed and ejecta buries crater rim and is barely visible
* 11.6 billion years (2.2 Gya): Last great tectonic period in Martian geologic history: Valles Marineris, largest canyon complex in the Solar System, forms – although some suggestions of thermokarst activity or even water erosion, it is suggested Valles Marineris is rift fault.

== Recent history ==
* 11.8 billion years (2 Gya): Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the Solar System, is formed
* 12.1 billion years (1.7 Gya): Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy captured into an orbit around Milky Way Galaxy
* 12.7 billion years (1.1 Gya): Copernican Period begins on Moon: defined by impact craters that possess bright optically immature ray systems
* 12.8 billion years (1 Gya): Interactions between Andromeda and its companion galaxies Messier 32 and Messier 110. Galaxy collision with Messier 82 forms its patterned spiral disc: galaxy interactions between NGC 3077 and Messier 81; Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan begins evolving the recognisable surface features that include rivers, lakes, and deltas
* 13 billion years (800 Mya): Copernicus (lunar crater) forms from the impact on the Lunar surface in the area of Oceanus Procellarum – has terrace inner wall and 30 km wide, sloping rampart that descends nearly a kilometre to the surrounding mare
* 13.175 billion years (625 Mya): formation of Hyades star cluster: consists of a roughly spherical group of hundreds of stars sharing the same age, place of origin, chemical content and motion through space
* 13.2 billion years (600 Mya): Whirlpool Galaxy collides with NGC 5195 forming a present connected galaxy system. HD 189733 b forms around parent star HD 189733: the first planet to reveal the climate, organic constituencies, even colour (blue) of its atmosphere 
* 13.6–13.5 billion years (300-200 Mya): Sirius, the brightest star in the Earth&#x27;s sky, forms. 
* 13.7 billion years (100 Mya): Formation of Pleiades Star Cluster
* 13.780 billion years (20 Mya): Possible formation of Orion Nebula
* 13.792 billion years (7.6 Mya): Betelgeuse forms.
* 13.8 billion years (Without uncertainties): Present day.

<doc id="183594" wikidata="Q1007059" url="?curid=183594" title="GNU Savannah">
<text>GNU Savannah is a project of the Free Software Foundation initiated by Loïc Dachary, which serves as a collaborative software development management system for free software projects. Savannah currently offers CVS, GNU arch, Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, mailing list, web hosting, file hosting, and bug tracking services. Savannah initially ran on the same SourceForge software that at the time was used to run the SourceForge portal.

Savannah&#x27;s website is split into two domain names: savannah.gnu.org for software that is officially part of the GNU Project, and savannah.nongnu.org for all other software.

Unlike SourceForge or GitHub, Savannah&#x27;s focus is for hosting free software projects and has very strict hosting policies, including a ban against the use of non-free formats (such as Adobe Flash) to ensure that only free software is hosted. When registering a project, project submitters have to state which free software license the project uses.

Project owners do not have the freedom of deleting their submitted projects on their own wish and the staff has a policy of refusing all deletion requests, unless the project was approved by mistake or has always been empty.

==History==
Loïc Dachary installed SourceForge on a server located in Boston for the benefit of the GNU Project (specifically, to power the GNU Savannah&#x27;s website). When, as contributor to SourceForge, he found out it was to be turned into proprietary software, he forked it and named it Savannah (since it was the software running the GNU Project&#x27;s Savannah website and had no other name). People contributing to GNU Savannah were called savannah-hackers from this day, as it was at first more a quick hack than anything else.

CERN took interest in the sourcecode and hired Mathieu Roy, a savannah-hacker, to work in Geneva. It led to the development of Savane (software) starting in 2003.

In 2003, Vincent Caron, friend to Loïc Dachary, found out the security of the server located was compromised. A new server was bought by the Free Software Foundation to provide a clean reinstall of the software. When this server was put in place, after a four-month outage without any public news, only Free Software Foundation employees had access to it. Notably savannah-hackers had no access and found out that Richard M. Stallman decided to move GNU Savannah to GForge because it was &quot;seriously maintained&quot;. In response, Vincent Caron, Loïc Dachary and Mathieu Roy put up an alternative instance of the software called Gna!, with a specific constitution inspired by the Debian Social Contract designed to prevent any unexpected take over.

GNU Savannah was totally or partly offline for months and, ultimately, did not move to GForge, which itself turned into proprietary software.

<doc id="183596" wikidata="Q58828" url="?curid=183596" title="Otto von Kotzebue">
<text>Otto von Kotzebue (; 30 December 1787 – 15 February 1846) was a Baltic German naval officer in the Imperial Russian Navy. He commanded two naval expeditions into the Pacific for the purposes of exploration and scientific investigation. The first expedition explored Oceania and the western coast of North America and passed through the Bering Strait in search of a passage across the Arctic Ocean. His second voyage was intended as a military resupply mission to Kamchatka but again included significant explorations of the west coast of North America and Oceania.

==Early life and education==
Kotzebue was born and raised in Reval (Tallinn), in the Governorate of Estonia of the Russian Empire. He was the second son of German writer and diplomat August von Kotzebue. The Kotzebue family was of Brandenburgish origin; his earliest known patrilineal ancestors were from Kossebau in Altmark. 

After attending the Saint Petersburg school of cadets, he accompanied Adam Johann von Krusenstern on his voyage of 1803–1806. Both attested to the prominence of Baltic Germans in Imperial Russia&#x27;s naval expeditions around 1800.

== First voyage, 1815 to 1818 ==

On promotion to lieutenant, Kotzebue was placed in command of an expedition fitted out at the expense of the imperial chancellor, Count Nikolay Rumyantsev, on the brig &quot;Rurik&quot;. In this vessel, with only twenty-seven men, including the naturalists Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz and Adelbert von Chamisso, and the artist Louis Choris, Kotzebue set out from Kronstadt on July 30, 1815 to find a passage across the Arctic Ocean and explore the less-known parts of Oceania.

Proceeding via Cape Horn, he visited the Chilean coast and arrived at Easter Island on March 29, 1816. From there he sailed west and reached the Tuamotu Archipelago around April 16 where he sighted several islands, some of which he named: Doubtful, so named because he thought it might be the Dog Island (Pukapuka); Romanzoff (Tikei); Spiridoff; the Palliser Islands discovered by Cook; Rurick&#x27;s chain (Arutua); and Krusenstern (Tikahau). He reached Penrhyn atoll on May 1 and was greeted by the natives who came out in canoes. After leaving Polynesia, Kotzebue came upon the Radak and Ralik chains of the Marshall Islands in Micronesia.

Kotzebue then headed north for the Kamchatka Peninsula where he anchored at the harbor of St. Peter and St. Paul on June 18. From there he explored Bering Strait and the coast of Alaska. A sound north of Bering Strait was named Kotzebue Sound. In September he sailed south to California.

Returning by the coast of Asia, he again sailed to the south, sojourned for three weeks at the Sandwich Islands during the Schäffer affair, an attempt by the Russian-American Company to seize Kauai. On January 1, 1817, Kotzebue discovered New Year Island. After further cruising in the Pacific Ocean, he proceeded north. Severe illness compelled him to return to Europe, and he reached the Neva River in Russia on August 3, 1818, bringing home a large collection of previously unknown plants and new ethnological information.

==Second voyage, 1823 to 1826==
In 1823 Kotzebue, now a captain, was entrusted with the command of an expedition of two ships of war, the main object of which was to take reinforcements to Kamchatka and patrol the northwest American coast to protect Russian settlements from the smuggling by foreign traders. A staff of scientists on board the Russian sailing sloop &quot;Enterprise&quot; collected much valuable information and material in geography, ethnography and natural history. Naturalist Eschscholtz again accompanied Kotzebue along with geologist Ernst Reinhold von Hofmann, astronomer Ernst Wilhelm Preuss and physicist Emil Lenz.

The expedition left Kronstadt on July 28, 1823, and rounded Cape Horn on December 23. Kotzebue visited Chile and then sailed west through the Tuamotu Archipelago on the way to Tahiti. The expedition reached Matavai Bay, Tahiti, on March 14. Kotzebue met various members of the London Missionary Society before leaving the island on March 24.

Kotzebue reached Petropavlovsk in July 1824. That same year he visited Mission Santa Clara and noted the conditions of the &quot;monjerío.&quot; Many positions along the coast were rectified, the Navigator islands visited, and several discoveries made. The expedition returned by the Marianas, Philippines, New Caledonia and the Hawaiian Islands, reaching Kronstadt on July 10, 1826.

When he returned, Kotzebue was promoted to command of the fleet squadron at Kronshtadt, but he left the service in 1830 because of failing health. Kotzebue spent the last years of his life at his Triigi Manor near Kose. He died in Reval in 1846.

Both of Kotzebue&#x27;s narratives: &quot;A Voyage of Discovery into the South Sea and Bering’s Straits for the Purpose of exploring a North-East Passage, undertaken in the Years 1815–1818&quot; (3 vols. 1821), and &quot;A New Voyage Round the World in the Years 1823–1826&quot; (1830), have been translated into English.

==Legacy and honors==
*Kotzebue Sound and the city of Kotzebue, Alaska are named after him. 
*Kotzebue Street in the Kalamaja area of northern Tallinn in Estonia is named after him and after his father August von Kotzebue, who both lived on the street. 
*The butterfly &quot;Pachliopta kotzebuea&quot; was named after him by Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, a botanist aboard the &quot;Rurik&quot;.

<text>A  (), or (), is a factory that is largely duty free and tariff-free. These factories take raw materials and assemble, manufacture, or process them and export the finished product. These factories and systems are present throughout Latin America, including Mexico, Paraguay, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. date back to 1964, when the Mexican government introduced the (&#x27;Border Industrialization Program&#x27;). Specific programs and laws have made Mexico&#x27;s maquila industry grow rapidly.

== History ==
From 1942 to 1964, the Bracero program allowed men with farming experience to work on US farms on a seasonal basis, and its end ushered in a new era for the development of Mexico. The Border Industrialization Program (BIP) began in 1965 and allowed for a lowering in restrictions and duties on machinery, equipment and raw materials. Before this program, PRONAF, a national border program for infrastructure developments like building roads, parks, electricity, water, building factories, and cleaning up border cities, helped to improve situations along the US-Mexico Border. With BIP, foreign firms were able to use factories built under PRONAF to import raw materials and export goods for a cheaper cost than in other countries. One of the main goals of the Border Industrialization Program was to attract foreign investment.

In 1989, the federal government put in place specific procedures and requirements for maquilas under the &quot;Decree for Development and Operation of the Maquiladora Industry&quot;. Following a debt crisis in 1980, the Mexican economy liberalized and foreign investment increased. Factory jobs began to leave central Mexico, and workers followed the jobs from central Mexico to the maquilas in the north and on the border. In 1985, maquiladoras overtook tourism as the largest source of foreign exchange, and since 1996 they have been the second largest industry in Mexico behind the petroleum industry.

=== NAFTA ===
With the introduction of NAFTA in 1994, Northern Mexico became an export processing zone. This allowed multinational corporations from the US to produce products cheaply. Corporations could use a maquila to import materials and produce a good more cheaply than in the US by paying Mexican laborers lower wages and paying less in duties. Mexicans work for approximately one-sixth of the U.S. hourly rate. During the five years before NAFTA, maquila employment had grown at a rate of 47%; this figure increased to 86% in the next five years. The number of factories also increased dramatically. Between 1989 and 1994, 564 new plants opened; in the five years following, 1460 plants opened. However, the maquiladora growth is largely attributable to growth in US demand and devaluation of the peso, not NAFTA itself. In the 1970s, most maquiladoras were located around the Mexico–United States border. By 1994, these were spread in the interior parts of the country, although the majority of the plants were still near the border.

=== The 2000s ===
A 2011 Federal Reserve report indicated that the maquiladora industry affects U.S. border city employment in service sectors. Although the maquiladora industry suffered due to the early 2000s recession, maquiladoras constituted 54% of the US-Mexico trade in 2004, and by 2005, the maquiladora exports accounted for half of Mexico&#x27;s exports. In the 2000s, the maquila industry faced competition due to rise of other countries with availability of cheap labor, including Malaysia, India, and Pakistan. The biggest threat came from China&#x27;s Special Economic Areas.

==Growth and development==
During the later half of the 1960s, maquiladora industries rapidly expanded geographically and economically and by 1985, had become Mexico&#x27;s second largest source of income from exports, behind oil. Since 1973, maquiladoras have also accounted for nearly half of Mexico&#x27;s export assembly. Between 1995 and 2000, exports of assembled products in Mexico tripled, and the rate of the industry&#x27;s growth amounted to about one new factory per day. By the late twentieth century, the industry accounted for 25 percent of Mexico&#x27;s gross domestic product, and 17 percent of total Mexican employment.

=== Globalization ===
Since globalization and physical restructuring have contributed to the competition and advent of low-cost offshore assembly in places such as China, and countries in Central America, maquiladoras in Mexico have been on the decline since 2000. According to federal sources, approximately 529 maquiladoras shut down and investment in assembly plants decreased by 8.2 percent in 2002 after the imposition of countervailing duties on Chinese products, not available in North America, that were part of the electronics supply chain. Despite the decline, over 3,000 maquiladoras still exist along the 2,000 mile-long United States–Mexico border, providing employment for approximately one million workers, and importing more than $51 billion in supplies into Mexico. Research indicates that maquiladoras&#x27; post-NAFTA growth is connected to changes in Mexican wages relative to those in Asia and in the United States, and to fluctuations in U.S. industrial production. As of 2006, maquiladoras still accounted for 45 percent of Mexico&#x27;s exports. Maquiladoras, in general, are best represented among operations that are particularly assembly intensive.

==Women==

=== Women enter the labor force and face inequality through different means ===
Women entered the labor force in Mexico in large numbers in the latter half of the 20th century. Devaluations of the peso in 1982 and 1994 pushed many Mexican women into the labor force. Between 1970 and 1995, 18% more women were part of the working force, and many of these women were working in maquila factories. Women looked for work in factories because they could get jobs with few credentials and receive on the job training. Men working in maquilas were given positions of supervision, management, engineers, and technical jobs, while women were relegated to low-skill jobs. Young women tended to be hired more often than older women, but it depended on the circumstances of the job and type of factory. However, young single women often ended up in factories with better working conditions, like the electronics plants, while older women and mothers worked in more dangerous apparel factories.

Gender plays a key role in both disguising and preserving economic frustration in the city of Juárez, Mexico. Given that several women are brutally murdered in Mexico, with Juárez as one of the main city targets, it is essential to look into the orientations of male authority, cheap labor exploitation, and the maquiladoras export processing zone. Oftentimes, young women are murdered as a result of economic frustration, being directed at the maquiladora workers. Working women are viewed by the maquiladora system as &quot;cheap labor&quot; and easily replaceable, which makes it easy and acceptable to kill these women without consequences. In order to examine the relationship between gender and production, gender and violence, this article focuses on situating the killings of these women within their social and ideological contexts. In this piece, the reasons for these women&#x27;s treatment and the social justifications for it are examined.

Poverty is a key factor that motivates women to work in maquiladoras. The minimum wage set by the Mexican government is barely enough to help sustain a family even with both parents working. The minimum wage &quot;buys only about a quarter of the basic necessities that are essential for a typical worker&#x27;s family&quot;. Maquilas pay at much higher rate than the minimum wage in most markets since there is a lot of competition for the best workers, and workers will not work without transportation and other bonuses. The 2015 minimum wage was 70.1 pesos per day in Tijuana (minimum wages vary by zone and worker classification) or about $0.55 per hour at the 2016 exchange rate of 16 pesos per dollar, while most entry-level positions in maquilas paid closer to $2 per hour including bonuses and 25% being paid to Social Security, housing, and retirement. Even in maquila factories, wages are still very low and in many families the children are encouraged to start working at an early age to support the family. In some maquiladoras, workers are cut and their responsibilities are given to a single worker. These workers are not given a higher pay, and are expected to maintain their output without a decrease in quality. They often work involuntary overtimes and are often not paid for their extra labor.

=== Gendered violence in the maquiladora labor force ===

Allegedly, women are not allowed to be pregnant while working. Some maquilas require female workers to take pregnancy tests. Some require that workers resign if they are pregnant. Female applicants are made to take pregnancy tests and are only hired if not pregnant, and women that become pregnant while working at maquila factories are given more strenuous tasks and forced to work unpaid overtime to influence them to resign. The Humans Rights Watch wrote a report in 1996 about the failures of the government to address this issue despite the fact that pregnancy testing violates Mexican federal labor law. These practices have continued into the 21st century. Once on the job, many women face sexual harassment by supervisors and find no help from human resources.

Due to the cruel and horrific appearances of violence against women in Mexican society, feminists have been working at the community level to end sexual violence against women in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, many years before the #MeToo movement was even conceived. Sociologists and feminists wonder whether the #MeToo movement has already taken root in Mexico and if so, how? Sociologists and feminists ask themselves questions such as: Has Ciudad Juárez&#x27;s #MeToo movement made an influence on women&#x27;s lives there? If so, by how much and why? This article explores the significance of maquiladoras and how the working conditions there have impacted women as well, by allowing the exploitation of women. Finally, the article successfully communicates all of its ideas through a thorough discussion between its authors.

Rita Segato, is an Argentine-Brazilian scholar who also identifies as a feminist and has a sociological point of view, makes an effort to make sense of the femicides that occur in Ciudad Juárez. Segato examines the violence, bigotry, and ego with which Mexican men treat their women. These women are typically young ladies who are small, dark skinned, with long hair and work largely in the maquiladora labor force... In comparison to other parts of Mexico, Ciudad Juárez is a risky place for women to live. These Mexican men view these women&#x27;s bodies as &quot;throwaway&quot; and &quot;erasable objects&quot; that they can use anyway they choose. As if that weren&#x27;t clear, the bodies of women from the Mexican border continue to be consumed by misogyny that has reached the most dreadful level of brutality. Many women are injured in maquilas. Intense work pace and pressure on high production leads to injuries including upper back, neck, and shoulder pain. Many maquilas do not report accidents and workers are not compensated for injuries received on the job. Workplace hazards include toxic chemicals, and workplaces lack health and safety practices like ventilation and face masks. The men in authority severely exploit these women, which makes matters worse.

=== Unionization ===
While labor unions exist in maquiladoras, many are charro unions, which are government-supported and often fail to act in the interest of workers. Official unions discredit maquiladora workers by calling them &quot;agitators&quot;. Workers who complain can be fired and blacklisted from other jobs. Many contracts are only for a few months, allowing companies to have a high turn-over rate in which workers never have the chance to organize for their rights. Many tried to organize independent unions, but often failed. Rita Segato investigates the historical changes associated with war and the essential role that &quot;inhumanity&quot; obtains in it toward people who do not participate in the conflict, such as women and children. According to Segato, violence against women has stopped being an outcome of war but instead has turned into a &quot;strategic goal&quot;. Governed by armed corporations with the participation of state and para-state forces, this is where the new forms of conflict take place. Tragically, women and children have become victims of both physical abuse, bodily mutilation, body trafficking and commercialization.

In 1993, the Mexican labor federation, the Authentic Labor Front, and the United Electrical Workers worked together to improve conditions at the General Electric factory, but failed in the loss of an election. The Center for Labor Studies (CETLAC) was opened in the mid-1990s and worked to educate workers about their rights and activism decreased in light of violence against women. In Juarez, between 1993 and 2005, more than 370 women were murdered. In 2010, more than 370 women were murdered. A new wave of worker protests has emerged in the 21st Century as workers decide that enough is enough. In 2015 in Juarez, maquiladora workers set up encampments, plantons, to protest and demand independent unions. Rita Segato argues using a de-colonial feminist viewpoint that contends that patriarchal political structures existed in communal societies prior to colonialism. According to Segato, the modern gender system&#x27;s capture the changes of pre colonial dual gender structures which worsen inequality, boosts violence against women, and depoliticizes them. To Segato, pre colonial gender differs significantly from colonial-modern societies gender structures, which operate in terms of a beneficiary and its subordinated others. In this article, Segato focuses on the patriarchal institutions of Ciudad Juárez, Mexico and Brazil&#x27;s National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) to extensively analyze and characterize these preexisting structures.

The US–Mexico border region is highly stratified by race, class, and gender. According to Segato, the racialization of individuals living south of the border underlies and reinforces prosecution of &quot;illegal aliens&quot;, ultimately endangering Mexican women and children. In the city of Juarez, women have been murdered as a result of the maquiladora killings.

=== The Han Young case ===
The Han Young maquiladora was a plant in Tijuana that manufactured car parts for Hyundai. In 1997, what started as a complaint by a single injured worker turned into a years-long conflict where employees protested for their right to unionize. The struggle put the NAFTA labor side agreement to the test, but despite the workers&#x27; efforts, nothing ever came of it. The case became increasingly political and news-worthy as time went on. However, despite various US NAO hearings and transnational labor rights organizing, the workers were never able to unionize. On the contrary, by the end of the conflicts, all of the laborers had been fired and the maquiladora had been moved to the other side of Tijuana. This was in the face of a Mexican federal court ruling that the strikes had been legal and in fact the corporation had violated the law.

==Environmental effects==
Both the United States and Mexican governments claim to be committed to environmental protection, yet environmental policies have not always been enforced despite the fact that⁠⁠ maquilas are required to be certified and to provide an environmental impact statement. In Mexico, most maquiladoras are global players that use international standards for waste treatment and disposal that exceed Mexican requirements and that require any waste generated to be re-exported. The development of large factories led to a substantial output of hazardous waste that disrupted local communities. The La Paz Agreement signed by Mexico and the United States in 1983 requires hazardous waste created by United States corporations to be transported back to the United States for disposal. However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that only 91 of the 600 maquiladoras located along the Texas–Mexico border have returned hazardous waste to the United States since 1987. Among others, the United States Geological Survey, the state of California, and the Imperial County Health Department have all asserted that the New River, which flows from Mexicali in Mexico near the Americanborder into California&#x27;s Salton Sea, is &quot;the dirtiest river in America&quot;. The presence of toxic waste in towns near maquila factories has led to negative health outcomes for the people living there. Between 1988 and 1992, 163 children in Juarez were born without brains due to the toxic chemicals from factories. 
=== Improvement ===
There have been some improvement at the corporate level of environmental policy. As of the early 2000s, around 90% of maquiladoras had attained an environmental certification. This push to improve environmental policy was led by the Mexican government, not the international companies themselves. The EPA&#x27;s US–Mexico Border 2012 Program has an extensive plan to help with environmental issues along that border.

== Worker’s Health and Safety ==
Maquiladoras have a history of extremely harsh working conditions, often exploiting employees to increase profits. Since most maquiladoras are located in lower socioeconomic areas, the local communities must work in these conditions to survive. These conditions include chemical exposure, poor air quality and ventilation, physical strain, noise exposure, and limited regulation and enforcement of occupational safety standards. With the increase of electronic development in the 1980s and 1990s, there was an increase in diseases caused by exposure to metals, such as lead poisoning and neurological disorders. Employees in maquiladoras often lack proper safety equipment such as hard hats, safety glasses and vests, and personal respirators, increasing the risk of exposure to hazards.

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) also indirectly caused a surge in the development of maquiladoras, which caused workers to face more frequent exposure to harmful substances without proper enforcement of industrial hygiene standards. This led to several public health campaigns from U.S. and Mexican advocacy groups for better hygiene practices to help protect workers and their families from hazardous exposures. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, workers suffered from toluene exposure due to its common use in several manufacturing processes, causing symptoms of dizziness, nausea, and other neurological issues. This issue drew public attention and highlighted the risks of inadequate ventilation within maquiladoras and the need for personal protective equipment.

Due to the expansion of U.S. trade and investment in Mexico, the need for maquiladoras grew substantially between 1985 and 1992. This led to large companies in the U.S. shifting labor-intensive manufacturing to Mexico to maintain high profit margins. Although maquiladoras provided jobs for local communities, it soon became apparent that health standards in many factories were not properly regulated, garnering publicity from U.S. and Mexican advocacy groups. Very minimal safety training programs were established, but the long-term risks from exposure to chemical and physical hazards were detrimental to the worker’s health and safety.

<text>Sidereus Nuncius (usually Sidereal Messenger, also Starry Messenger or Sidereal Message) is a short astronomical treatise (or &quot;pamphlet&quot;) published in Neo-Latin by Galileo Galilei on March 13, 1610. It was the first published scientific work based on observations made through a telescope, and it contains the results of Galileo&#x27;s early observations of the imperfect and mountainous Moon, of hundreds of stars not visible to the naked eye in the Milky Way and in certain constellations, and of the Medicean Stars (later Galilean moons) that appeared to be circling Jupiter.

The Latin word &quot;nuncius&quot; was typically used during this time period to denote &quot;messenger&quot;; however, it was also (though less frequently) rendered as &quot;message&quot;. Though the title &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot; is usually translated into English as &quot;Sidereal Messenger&quot;, many of Galileo&#x27;s early drafts of the book and later related writings indicate that the intended purpose of the book was &quot;simply to report the news about recent developments in astronomy, not to pass himself off solemnly as an ambassador from heaven.&quot;

==Telescope==
The first telescopes appeared in the Netherlands in 1608 when Middelburg spectacle-maker Hans Lippershey tried to obtain a patent on one. By 1609 Galileo had heard about it and built his own improved version. He probably was not the first person to aim the new invention at the night sky but his was the first systematic (and published) study of celestial bodies using one. One of Galileo&#x27;s first telescopes had 8x to 10x linear magnification and was made out of lenses that he had ground himself. This was increased to 20x linear magnification in the improved telescope he used to make the observations in &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot;.

==Content==
&quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot; contains more than seventy drawings and diagrams of the Moon, certain constellations such as Orion, the Pleiades, and Taurus, and the Medicean Stars of Jupiter. Galileo&#x27;s text also includes descriptions, explanations, and theories of his observations.

===Moon===
In observing the Moon, Galileo saw that the line separating lunar day from night (the terminator) was smooth where it crossed the darker regions of the Moon but quite irregular where it crossed the brighter areas. From this he deduced that the darker regions are flat, low-lying areas, and the brighter regions rough and mountainous. Basing his estimate on the distance of sunlit mountaintops from the terminator, he judged, quite accurately, that the lunar mountains were at least four miles high. Galileo&#x27;s engravings of the lunar surface provided a new form of visual representation, besides shaping the field of selenography, the study of physical features on the Moon.

===Stars===
Galileo reported that he saw at least ten times more stars through the telescope than are visible to the naked eye, and he published star charts of the belt of Orion and the star cluster Pleiades showing some of the newly observed stars. With the naked eye observers could see only six stars in the Pleiades; through his telescope, however, Galileo was capable of seeing thirty-five – almost six times as many. When he turned his telescope on Orion, he was capable of seeing eighty stars, rather than the previously observed nine – almost nine times more. In &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot;, Galileo revised and reproduced these two star groups by distinguishing between the stars seen without the telescope and those seen with it. Also, when he observed some of the &quot;nebulous&quot; stars in the Ptolemaic star catalogue, he saw that rather than being cloudy, they were made of many small stars. From this he deduced that the nebulae and the Milky Way were &quot;congeries of innumerable stars grouped together in clusters&quot; too small and distant to be resolved into individual stars by the naked eye.

===Medicean Stars (Moons of Jupiter)===
In the last part of &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot;, Galileo reported his discovery of four objects that appeared to form a straight line of stars near Jupiter. On the first night he detected a line of three little stars close to Jupiter parallel to the ecliptic; the following nights brought different arrangements and another star into his view, totalling four stars around Jupiter. Throughout the text, Galileo gave illustrations of the relative positions of Jupiter and its apparent companion stars as they appeared nightly from late January through early March 1610. That they changed their positions relative to Jupiter from night to night and yet always appeared in the same straight line near it, persuaded Galileo that they were orbiting Jupiter. On January 11 after four nights of observation he wrote:

:I therefore concluded and decided unhesitatingly, that there are three stars in the heavens moving about Jupiter, as Venus and Mercury round the Sun; which at length was established as clear as daylight by numerous subsequent observations. These observations also established that there are not only three, but four, erratic sidereal bodies performing their revolutions round Jupiter...the revolutions are so swift that an observer may generally get differences of position every hour.

In his drawings, Galileo used an open circle to represent Jupiter and asterisks to represent the four stars. He made this distinction to show that there was in fact a difference between these two types of celestial bodies. It is important to note that Galileo used the terms &quot;planet&quot; and &quot;star&quot; interchangeably, and &quot;both words were correct usage within the prevailing Aristotelian terminology.&quot;

At the time of &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot;″ publication, Galileo was a mathematician at the University of Padua and had recently received a lifetime contract for his work in building more powerful telescopes. He desired to return to Florence, and in hopes of gaining patronage there, he dedicated &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot; to his former pupil, now the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici. In addition, he named his discovered four moons of Jupiter the &quot;Medicean Stars,&quot; in honor of the four royal Medici brothers. This helped him receive the position of Chief Mathematician and Philosopher to the Medici at the University of Pisa. Ultimately, his effort at naming the moons failed, for they are now referred to as the &quot;Galilean moons&quot;.

==Reception==
The reactions to &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot;, ranging from appraisal and hostility to disbelief, soon spread throughout Italy and England. Many poems and texts were published expressing love for the new form of astronomical science. Three works of art were even created in response to Galileo&#x27;s book: Adam Elsheimer&#x27;s &quot;The Flight into Egypt&quot; (1610; contested by Keith Andrews), Lodovico Cigoli&#x27;s &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot; (1612), and Andrea Sacchi&#x27;s &quot;Divine Wisdom&quot; (1631). In addition, the discovery of the Medicean Stars fascinated other astronomers, and they wanted to view the moons for themselves. Their efforts &quot;set the stage for the modern scientific requirement of experimental reproducibility by independent researchers. Verification versus falsifiability…saw their origins in the announcement of &quot;Sidereus Nuncius.&quot;&quot;

But many individuals and communities were sceptical. A common response to the Medicean Stars was simply to say that the telescope had a lens defect and was producing illusory points of light and images; those saying this completely denied the existence of the moons. That only a few could initially see and verify what Galileo had observed supported the supposition that the optical theory during this period &quot;could not clearly demonstrate that the instrument was not deceiving the senses.&quot; By naming the four moons after the Medici brothers and convincing the Grand Duke Cosimo II of his discoveries, the defence of Galileo&#x27;s reports became a matter of State. Moran notes, “the court itself became actively involved in pursuing the confirmation of Galileo’s observations by paying Galileo out of its treasury to manufacture spyglasses that could be sent through ambassadorial channels to the major courts of Europe.&quot; The secretary to Giovanni Antonio Magini, a Bohemian astronomer named Martin Horký, published an incendiary pamphlet criticizing the &quot;Sidereus Nuncius,&quot; alleging in it that Galileo&#x27;s observations were the result of poor lenses and influenced by personal ambitions. After gaining some traction in Italy, however, Horky&#x27;s work was ultimately strongly rebutted.

The first astronomer to publicly support Galileo&#x27;s findings was Johannes Kepler, who published an open letter in April 1610, enthusiastically endorsing Galileo&#x27;s credibility. It was not until August 1610 that Kepler was able to publish his independent confirmation of Galileo&#x27;s findings, due to the scarcity of sufficiently powerful telescopes.

Several astronomers, such as Thomas Harriot, Joseph Gaultier de la Vatelle, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, and Simon Marius, published their confirmation of the Medicean Stars after Jupiter became visible again in the autumn of 1610. Marius, a German astronomer who had studied with Tycho Brahe, was the first to publish a book of his observations. Marius attacked Galileo in &quot;Mundus Jovialis&quot; (published in 1614) by insisting that he had found Jupiter&#x27;s four moons before Galileo and had been observing them since 1609. Marius believed that he therefore had the right to name them, which he did: he named them after Jupiter&#x27;s love conquests: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. But Galileo was not confounded; he pointed out that being outside the Church, Marius had not yet accepted the Gregorian calendar and was still using the Julian calendar. Therefore, the night Galileo first observed Jupiter&#x27;s moons was January 7, 1610 on the Gregorian calendar—December 28, 1609 on the Julian calendar (Marius claimed to have first observed Jupiter&#x27;s moons on December 29, 1609). Although Galileo did indeed discover Jupiter&#x27;s four moons before Marius, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are now the names of Galileo&#x27;s four moons.

By 1626 knowledge of the telescope had spread to China when German Jesuit and astronomer Johann Adam Schall von Bell published Yuan jing shuo, (Explanation of the Telescope) in Chinese and Latin.

==Controversy with the Catholic Church==
Galileo&#x27;s drawings of an imperfect Moon directly contradicted Ptolemy&#x27;s and Aristotle&#x27;s cosmological descriptions of perfect and unchanging heavenly bodies made of quintessence (the fifth element in ancient and medieval philosophy of which the celestial bodies are composed).

Before the publication of &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot;, the Catholic Church accepted the Copernican heliocentric system as strictly mathematical and hypothetical. However, once Galileo began to speak of the Copernican system as fact rather than theory, it introduced &quot;a more chaotic system, a less-than-godly lack of organization.&quot; In fact, the Copernican system that Galileo believed to be real challenged the Scripture, &quot;which referred to the sun &#x27;rising&#x27; and the earth as &#x27;unmoving.

The conflict ended in 1633 with Galileo being sentenced to a form of house arrest by the Catholic Church. However, by 1633, Galileo had published other works in support of the Copernican view, and these were largely what caused his sentencing.

<text>Edward Vernon Rickenbacker (born Edward Rickenbacher, October 8, 1890 – July 23, 1973) was an American fighter pilot in World War I and a Medal of Honor recipient. With 26 aerial victories, he was the most successful and most decorated United States flying ace of the war. He was also a racing driver, an automotive designer, and a long-time head of Eastern Air Lines.
== Early life ==

Rickenbacker was born Edward Rickenbacher in Columbus, Ohio. He was the third of eight children born to German-speaking Swiss immigrants, Lizzie (née Liesl Basler) and Wilhelm Rickenbacher. Later in life, he changed the spelling of his last name to Rickenbacker and adopted a middle name, Vernon.

His father worked for breweries and street-paving crews and his mother Lizzie took in laundry to supplement the family income. In 1893, his father owned a construction company. With a loan from Lizzie&#x27;s parents, the couple purchased a lot and built a small home on 1334 East Livingston Avenue, southeast of downtown at the edge of the city limits in 1893. The house lacked running water, indoor plumbing, and electricity. This is where Edd, as he was called by his parents, spent his childhood.

Growing up, Rickenbacker worked before and after school. He helped in the garden where the family grew potatoes, cabbages, and turnips and cared for the family&#x27;s chickens, goats, and pigs. He earned money by delivering papers, setting up pins at a bowling alley, and selling scavenged goods. He gave most of his earnings to his mother but spent some on Bull Durham tobacco, a habit he picked up from his older brother Bill.

As a child, Rickenbacker was accident-prone. Before entering school, he toddled into an oncoming horse-drawn streetcar and fell into an open cistern. His brother rescued him from a passing coal car twice. Once, he ran back into his burning school building to retrieve his coat and nearly paid for it with his life. Sixty years later when producing his autobiography, he found significance in these close calls. He came to believe that God had repeatedly saved him for a higher purpose.

Young Rickenbacker had an artistic side and enjoyed painting watercolors of animals, flowers, and scenery. He tried to design a perpetual motion machine, but, his father berated him for wasting time on an invention with no purpose. He was also &quot;sort of the leader&quot; of the Horsehead Gang, with whom he smoked, played hooky, and broke streetlamps. With the Horsehead Gang, he constructed pushcarts that were a precursor to the Soapbox Derby. Once, the Horsehead Gang took a &quot;roller coaster ride&quot; in a quarry cart and his leg was run over and badly sliced. After the Wright brothers&#x27; first airplane flight, Rickenbacker tried to &quot;fly&quot; a bicycle outfitted with an umbrella off of his friend&#x27;s barn roof.

The summer before Rickenbacker&#x27;s fourteenth birthday, his father was injured in a brawl. After being hit in the head with a level, Rickenbacker&#x27;s father was in a coma for almost six weeks before his death on August 26, 1904. His assailant was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in prison.

== Career beginnings ==
Though his older siblings Bill and Mary were working, Rickenbacker felt a responsibility to help replace his father&#x27;s lost income. He dropped out of the seventh grade and went to work full-time, lying about his age to work around child labor laws. He worked eight different jobs during the next two years. While working at the Oscar Lear Automobile Company in 1905, he took an engineering course from the International Correspondence School. Chief engineer Lee Frayer took Rickenbacker under his wing, giving him more responsibility in the workshop.

Two months later, when it came time to compete in the 1906 Vanderbilt Cup race, Frayer brought Rickenbacker to New York as his riding mechanic. After two practice runs, their engine overheated and they failed to get to the starting line for their qualifying run.

Back in Columbus, Rickenbacker followed his mentor to the Columbus Buggy Company as a chief testing engineer, supervising upwards of a dozen men in his department. The sixteen-year-old Rickenbacker&#x27;s hard work and mechanical acumen impressed Harvey S. Firestone, his new employer. Firestone chose Rickenbacker for special assignments, including troubleshooting in Atlantic City and demonstrating at the 1909 Chicago Automobile Show.

Later that year, Firestone sent Rickenbacker to Texas to figure out why the new Frayer-designed engines were overheating. Rickenbacker solved the problem and stayed on to head up Columbus Buggy&#x27;s Dallas agency. At eighteen, he was the chief engineer, experimenter, demonstrator, mechanic, and salesman. During this time, he served as a chauffeur to the visiting William Jennings Bryan, getting his picture and his cars in the newspaper. He made three sales as a result. In March 1910, Firestone sent Rickenbacker to direct the Upper Midwest Agency out of Omaha. At nineteen, Rickenbacker was in charge of six men, covering sales, distribution, and maintenance of Firestone-Columbus automobiles in four states. He earned $125 per week.

== Automobile racing ==

To draw attention to his company&#x27;s car, Rickenbacker entered a 25-mile race in Red Oak, Iowa. He failed to finish in his first automobile race after crashing through an outer fence. That summer, Rickenbacker went on to win most of the dirt track races he entered, including five of six races at Omaha&#x27;s Aksarben Festival in October. When reporting on races, newspapers misspelled his name as Reichenbaugh, Reichenbacher, or Reichenberger, before settling on Rickenbacker.

The following May, Lee Frayer invited his protégé to join him in another racing venture: the first ever Indianapolis 500. As relief driver, Rickenbacker replaced Frayer in the middle portion of the race, driving the majority of miles and helping his former boss take thirteenth place. The next year he drove Frayer&#x27;s Red Wing Special by himself but was forced out after 100 miles with mechanical difficulties. Rickenbacker quit his sales job and went on the county fair circuit with a Flying Squadron team.

In October 1912, the American Automobile Association (AAA) cracked down on drivers known for flouting safety regulations. Rickenbacker was barred from the track for the next twelve months. He joined the automobile workshop of Frederick and August Duesenberg in Des Moines, Iowa. For the next year, he worked sixteen-hour days at $3 a day, developing a Mason race car, named for Duesenberg&#x27;s chief investor.

In July 1913, Rickenbacker received dispensation from AAA to compete in his hometown Columbus 200-mile race. Somehow, he kept his racing reinstatement through the rest of the season. He won three times and finished the season in 27th place on the AAA standings with 115 points. In 1914, the Duesenberg team separated from their investor, Edward R. Mason. Winning the prize money became vital for Rickenbacker because he would be out of racing for the season if Duesenberg ran out of funds. With some hard driving, he won the Fourth of July race at Sioux City. A third-place finish by another Duesenberg driver brought in $12,500 and ensured that the team would complete the season. Rickenbacker finished the year in sixth place in the AAA standings.

Rickenbacker was now a national racing figure, earning the nickname &quot;Fast Eddie&quot;. One sportswriter called him &quot;the most daring and...the most cautious driver in America today.&quot; The top-ranked Peugeot team lured Rickenbacker away from Duesenberg at the start of 1915. However, a couple of bad outings caused him to abandon Peugeot and switch to the Maxwell team. Looking back decades later, Rickenbacker called this &quot;the major mistake of my racing career&quot;. Still, he finished the season ranked fifth among all racers, with three victories to his credit. In September 1915, Rickenbacker received financial backing from Indianapolis Speedway owner Carl Fisher and his partner, Fred Allison. They made Rickenbacker the leader of a new Presto-Lite team, giving him free rein over three drivers and four mechanics as they developed four Maxwell Special race cars.

In 1915, newspapers began spelling his name with a second &quot;k&quot; more frequently, with his active encouragement. He also decided his given name &quot;looked a little plain&quot; and adopted a middle initial, signing his name 26 times with different letters before settling upon &quot;V.&quot; The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; referred to him as &quot;Edward Victor Rickenbacher&quot; after his win at Sheepshead Bay in 1916.

In the 1915–16 seasons, Rickenbacker won at Sioux City for the third year in a row, as well as Tacoma and Sheepshead Bay (New York). In September, he was in a three-way tie for the championship with Dario Resta and Johnny Aitken. He needed a win at the Indianapolis Harvest 100 to take first place. He had the lead in the penultimate lap but had driven his car into the ground. Driving on three wheels, Aitken passed Rickenbacker&#x27;s broken-down Maxwell Special. Rickenbacker called it &quot;one of the grandest free-for-alls I ever was in.&quot; He finished the year in third place in the standings but with a win in Los Angeles. He was now one of the most famous race car drivers in America and was earning $40,000 a year.

Signing with the British Sunbeam team for the upcoming season, Rickenbacker sailed to England to work to develop a new race car. Before he could disembark at Liverpool for his new job with Sunbeam, Rickenbacker was detained by two plainclothes agents from Scotland Yard. A 1914 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article had fabricated a story claiming that the young driver was Baron Rickenbacher, &quot;the disowned son of a Prussian noble.&quot; With Britain deep into World War I, Scotland Yard considered him a potential spy.

In England, Rickenbacker worked at the Sunbeam shop in Wolverhampton during the week and spent weekends at the Savoy Hotel in London. The English police surveilled Rickenbacker the entire six weeks he was in England and for another two weeks when he was back in the United States. In 1917, after his experience as a suspected spy and to anglicize his name, he officially changed the spelling of his name from Rickenbacher to Rickenbacker. A few years later, he settled on the middle name &quot;Vernon&quot; after the brother of his boyhood crush, Blanche Calhoun.

== World War I ==

=== Pre–U.S. entry ===

While in England, Rickenbacker watched Royal Flying Corps airplanes fly over the Thames from the Brooklands aerodrome. He began to consider a role in aviation if the United States entered the European war. The month before, while he had been in Los Angeles, Rickenbacker had had two chance encounters with aviators. Glenn Martin, founder of Glenn L. Martin Company and more recently with Wright-Martin Aircraft, gave Rickenbacker his first ride aloft. Next, Major Townsend F. Dodd was stranded with his plane in a field and Rickenbacker diagnosed a magneto problem. Dodd later became General John J. Pershing&#x27;s aviation officer and an important contact in Rickenbacker&#x27;s attempt to join air combat.

Back in the United States after the revelation of the Zimmermann Telegram, Rickenbacker shared his idea for an aero squadron composed of race car drivers and mechanics with a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter: &quot;War would practically put a stop to racing, and we have a training that our country would need in the time of war. We are experts in judging speed and in motor knowledge.&quot; His theory was that such men, accustomed to tight confines and making split-second decisions at high speeds, would make excellent fighter pilots, though his idea was ignored by the military. After the April 6 declaration of war by the United States, Rickenbacker went to Washington, D.C. to propose his idea without success.

=== Flight training ===

In late May 1917, a week before he was to race in Cincinnati, Rickenbacker was invited to sail to England with General John J. Pershing. By mid-June, he was in France, where he enlisted in the United States infantry. He was assigned to drive Army officials between Paris and A.E.F. headquarters in Chaumont, and on to various points on the Western Front. Rickenbacker earned the rank of Sergeant First Class but never drove for General Pershing. Rather, he mostly drove for Major Dodd. A chance encounter with Captain James Miller on the Champs-Elysees put Rickenbacker on the track to becoming a fighter pilot. Miller asked Rickenbacker to be the chief engineer at the flight school and aerodrome he was establishing at Issoudun. Rickenbacker bargained for the chance to learn to fly at the French flight school outside Toul. He received five weeks of training or 25 hours in the air in September 1917. Then, he went to Issoudun to start constructing the United States Air Service&#x27;s pursuit training facility,

During the next three months, Rickenbacker took time from his work schedule to continue his flight training, standing in at the back of lectures and taking airplanes up on his own to practice new maneuvers. In January 1918, Rickenbacker finagled his way into a release for gunnery school, the final step to becoming a pursuit pilot.

In February and March, Lieutenant Rickenbacker and the officers of the nascent 1st Pursuit Group completed advanced training at Villeneuve–les–Vertus Aerodrome. There he came under the tutelage and mentorship of the French flying ace, Major Raoul Lufbery. With regards to flying, Rickenbacker said, &quot;All I learned, I learned from Lufbery&quot;. Lufbery took Rickenbacker and Douglas Campbell on their first patrol before their Nieuport 28s were outfitted with machine guns. Rickenbacker earned the respect of the other fliers, who called him &quot;Rick&quot;.

Both squadrons relocated to Toul, in the St. Mihiel sector, where Rickenbacker had begun his training with the French seven months earlier. Now the American air service had its aerodrome at nearby Gengoult. Before beginning their patrols, the two squadrons chose an insignia to paint on their planes. The 95th chose a kicking mule. The 94th chose an Uncle Sam stovepipe hat, tipped inside a surrounding circle. One officer remarked, &quot;Well, I guess our hat is in the ring now!&quot;, and the squadron became known as The Hat-in-the-Ring Gang.

=== Early aerial combat ===

Rickenbacker&#x27;s first sortie was with Reed Chambers on April 13, 1918. It almost ended in disaster when both became lost in the fog and Chambers was forced to land. Flight commander David Peterson called Rickenbacker a &quot;bloody fool for flying off in a fog&quot;. Two weeks later, on April 29, Rickenbacker shot down his first enemy plane. On May 28, he claimed his fifth victory and became an ace. Rickenbacker received the French Croix de Guerre that month. However, Rickenbacker was not perfect: he almost fired on friendly planes several times, his gun jammed, and he nearly crashed when his Nieuport&#x27;s fabric wing tore off in a dive.

On May 30, 1918, he achieved his sixth victory, but it would be his last for three and a half months. In late June, he had a fever and ear infection that turned into an abscess and grounded him most of the Chateau Thierry campaign. While recovering in a Paris hospital in July, Rickenbacker reflected on his shortcomings as a pilot, deciding he needed more self-discipline and less impetuosity.

Rickenbacker was out of the hospital in time for the St. Mihiel offensive based out of Rembercourt Aerodrome on September 12, 1918. By this time, the 94th and the other squadrons of the 1st Pursuit had converted from their agile but temperamental Nieuport airplanes to the more rugged, higher-powered Spad XIII. The Spad was a good fit for Rickenbacker&#x27;s style of attack. He made another kill on September 14 against a Fokker D-VII, and another the day after that. Although Rickenbacker&#x27;s performance was rising, the 94th squadron&#x27;s was still disappointing. After a sluggish summer at Chateau Thierry, Major Harold Hartney wanted new leadership to lead the Hat-in-the-Ring Gang to its former greatness. He chose Lieutenant Rickenbacker over several captains as the new commander of the 94th Squadron.

=== Commander of the 94th Aero Squadron ===

Rickenbacker went to work turning his men &quot;back into a team&quot;. He gathered his pilots and exhorted them to stay focused on their mission. Reminding the mechanics that he was one of them, he stressed the crucial importance of their work. Above all, he let them know that he was a &quot;gimper&quot; or &quot;a bird who will stick by you through anything&quot; and &quot;would never ask anybody to do anything that [he] would not do [him] self first or do at the same time.&quot; To underscore his point, Rickenbacker took a solo patrol over the line and shot down two enemy planes the next morning. His victories above Billy, France, earned him the Medal of Honor, awarded by President Herbert Hoover in 1931.

Building on the leadership skills he developed with Maxwell, Rickenbacker turned the 94th Squadron into a winning team. He was determined to &quot;blind the eyes of the enemy&quot; by taking out their observation balloons. The giant gas bags appeared easy to bring down, but were heavily guarded and dangerous to attack. Rickenbacker led planning sessions for multi-squadron raids of as many as fourteen planes. One reporter likened him to a football coach, &quot;boning up for the season ahead&quot; with &quot;conferences on methods, blackboard talks, and ideas for air battle tactics&quot;. Rickenbacker was credited with bringing down five balloons,

Rickenbacker inculcated into the squadron with his new principles of engagement, which germinated while he was confined in the hospital: Never attack unless there is at least a fifty-fifty chance of success, always break off an engagement that seems hopeless, and know the difference between cowardice and common sense. He continued to fly aggressively, but with calculated caution. He also flew more patrols and spent more hours in the air than any other pilot in the service—a total of 300 combat hours. He brought down fifteen aircraft in the final six weeks of the war. In September 1918, he received the rank of captain. At the end of the war in France, the 94th had the highest number of air victories of the American squadrons.

When Rickenbacker learned of the Armistice, he flew an airplane above the No Man&#x27;s Land to observe the ceasefire as it occurred at 11:00 a.m. on November 11, 1918. He later wrote, &quot;I was the only audience for the greatest show ever presented. On both sides of no man&#x27;s land, the trenches erupted. Brown-uniformed men poured out of the American trenches, gray-green uniforms out of the German. From my observer&#x27;s seat overhead, I watched them throw their helmets in the air, discard their guns, wave their hands.&quot;

=== Military achievements ===

Rickenbacker received the Distinguished Service Cross a record number of eight times. In 1930, one of these awards was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. In addition, he received the Legion of Honor and the Croix de Guerre from France.

He brought down 26 aircraft during the war, making him the United States ace of aces for the war. His 26 victories remained the American record until Richard Bong&#x27;s forty victories in World War II. The following data is from Rickenbacker&#x27;s book, &quot;Fighting the Flying Circus.&quot; New York: Frederick A. Stokes, 1919, pp. 363–364.



== Between the wars ==

=== War hero ===

Rickenbacker returned home as a war hero. At the Waldorf-Astoria, 600 people, including Secretary of War Newton Baker and his mother, shuttled in from Columbus. They &quot;cheered him and toasted him and shouted and sang to him&quot;. On the streets, he was mobbed by souvenir seekers who tore buttons and ribbons off his uniform. He noted, &quot;The onslaught was pretty heavy, more than I liked, but I took it...&quot; Los Angeles gave him a parade in June.

Rickenbacker turned down several endorsement offers and an opportunity to star in a feature film. He said producer Carl Laemmle &quot;shoved a hundred-thousand-dollar certified check under my nose&quot;. Rickenbacker turned down these opportunities because he did not want to cheapen his image. He signed a book deal worth $25,000, publishing his memoir of the war, &quot;Fighting the Flying Circus&quot;. Rickenbacker also contracted for a speaking tour for $10,000; still in the Army, Rickenbacker also used this tour to promote liberty bonds. After the Liberty Bond tour, he was released from the army in November 1919 with a promotion to the rank of major, but he did not claim the promotion. He felt the rank of captain was the only one that was &quot;earned and deserved&quot;. He was referred to as Captain Eddie or just &quot;the Captain&quot; for the rest of his life.

Rickenbacker had a name he could capitalize on in any business he chose. He told a reporter, &quot;There is no comparison between the auto and the air. I am through with the automobile and I stand ready to place my skill and talents in flying.&quot; Around December 1919, Rickenbacker talked to Reed Chambers about a joint venture in aircraft manufacturing. However, the performance and safety of airplanes were a concern for the government and the general public. Rickenbacker resorted to his promotional abilities to generate public and governmental enthusiasm, but with limited success. In 1920 and 1921, he made four transcontinental crossings—twice in Junkers-Larsen JL-6s and twice in de Havilland DH-4s. During these trips, he had seven crack-ups, nine near misses, and eight forced landings in cornfields.

In 1925, Rickenbacker was a defense witness, along with Hap Arnold, Tooey Spaatz, Ira Eaker, and Fiorello H. La Guardia, in the court-martial of General Billy Mitchell.

=== Rickenbacker Motor Company ===

In October 1919, Rickenbacker accepted an offer from millionaire Byron F. Everitt of Everitt-Metzger-Flanders to develop a new car under the name Rickenbacker Motor Company (RMC). Other partners in the business were Harry Cunningham and Walter Flanders.

Rickenbacker designed the car, with Ray McNamara developing its core engineering. Rickenbacker&#x27;s most significant innovation was the tandem flywheel construction at the rear of the crankshaft that reduced vibration. The Rickenbacker automobile model took two years of development and of test driving by Rickenbacker before being unveiled at the New York Auto Show in 1922.

RMC marketed its vehicle as &quot;A Car Worthy of Its Name&quot; and also used the Hat-in-the Ring squadron symbol. It was a high-quality mid-priced car, &quot;up to the minute in every detail&quot;. RMC models sold for $1,500 to $2,000. Because it &quot;offers the least resistance to radio because of vibration&quot;, the Rickenbacker was selected to make the first transcontinental radio tour in June 1922. The next year, Leo Wood extolled its smooth ride in a pop song, &quot;In My Rickenbacker Car&quot;.

In mid-1923 Rickenbacker introduced his next innovation—four-wheel brakes. A decade earlier, he had benefited from these on the race track and wanted to make them standard on his commercial vehicles. However, his decision to make a mid-year introduction was costly. Rickenbacker blamed sales problems on a concerted industry media attack led by Studebaker. He said, &quot;That broke me; it was more responsible for my going broke...than anything else.&quot; A second mid-year change in 1924 left RMC dealers feeling mistreated and taking a financial hit. In 1925, the Rickenbacker model 8 was the pace car of the Indianapolis 500.

RMC declined when Rickenbacker failed to fully focus on RMC and continued work on aviation. In addition, the company&#x27;s production engineer, Walter Flanders, died. Above all, the arrival of the less expensive, equally reliable Chrysler cut into the RMC market. As RMC sales dropped and leadership bickered, Rickenbacker resigned from his role as vice president and director of sales. In November 1927, the company went bankrupt. Because he was a founder, Rickenbacker was responsible for $250,000 of debt.

=== Florida Airways ===

While he was supposed to be focusing on RMC, Rickenbacker tried to achieve speed and distance records in aviation across the United States. His focus shifted to creating a light plane that would be affordable for private ownership. In January 1923, he announced the Glider Trophy, an annual worldwide contest he established to encourage experimentation with glider design. The Trophy cost $5,000 to produce.

In 1926, Rickenbacker started Florida Airways, with wartime comrade Reed Chambers. Investors in the company included Henry Ford, Richard C. Hoyt of the Hayden, Stone &amp; Co. financial empire, and Percy Rockefeller. Ford&#x27;s investment included supplying three new airplanes.

Florida Airways began carrying airmail in April and passengers two months later, going between Miami and Jacksonville. However, Florida Airways was out of business before completing a full year of operations. It was a victim of the 1926 hurricane, the decline of the Florida real estate boom, and the failure of Tampa officials to deliver a promised airport. The company was purchased from receivership by Harold Pitcairn.

=== Indianapolis Motor Speedway ===

On November 1, 1927, Rickenbacker purchased the Indianapolis Motor Speedway from Carl Fisher for $700,000. He considered his salary of $5,000 a year and the opportunities for public relations to be more valuable than the $700,000 in debt he incurred. He also drove the speedway&#x27;s pace car for several years.

He operated the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for more than ten years, overseeing many improvements to the facility. He was responsible for the first radio broadcast of the Memorial Day 500 race. After a final race in 1941, he closed the Speedway to conserve gasoline, rubber, and other resources during World War II. In 1945, Rickenbacker sold the racetrack to the businessman Anton Hulman Jr.

=== General Motors ===

Before going to Detroit to produce his automobile with RMC, Rickenbacker took a job with General Motors (GM) as the California distributor for its new car, the Sheridan. He spent the first eight months of 1921 in California, creating a network of dealerships. He often traveled between cities by plane, a leased Bellanca.

In January 1928, Rickenbacker became assistant general manager for sales at GM for its Cadillac and LaSalle models. Later in the year, he took out a $90,000 loan to buy the Allison Engine Company and earned a significant amount on its resale to GM. Rickenbacker repeated this strategy with Bendix Corporation soon after.

By mid-1929, Rickenbacker returned his focus to aviation. He convinced GM to purchase Fokker Aircraft Corporation of America (FACA), the designer of the fighter planes he once faced on the Western Front. As compensation for his advice, Rickenbacker was promoted to vice president for sales for GM&#x27;s Fokker Aircraft Company. When Fokker Aircraft relocated its headquarters to Baltimore in 1932, Rickenbacker left. He became the vice president for governmental relations for American Airways, part of American Air Transport. While there, he convinced American Air Transport to purchase North American Aviation.

Ten months later, he left American Air Transport and returned to GM, convincing the automaker to purchase North American Aviation. When the deal went through in June 1933, Rickenbacker became vice president for public affairs in GM&#x27;s new aviation venture. North American Aviation was the parent company for Eastern Air Transport, Curtiss-Wright Corporation, and Trans World Airlines.

In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt rescinded existing mail contracts with private airlines and moved air mail transportation to the U.S. Army Air Corps. At the time, Rickenbacker was vice president of Eastern Air Transport, one of the companies affected. He became an outspoken critic of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies, seeing them as little better than socialism. This drew criticism and ire from the press and the Roosevelt administration, which ordered NBC Radio to no longer allow Rickenbacker to broadcast his criticisms of Roosevelt&#x27;s policies. When several inexperienced, undertrained Army pilots crashed and died while hauling mail on treacherous routes, Rickenbacker called it &quot;legalized murder!&quot;

=== Eastern Air Lines ===

Rickenbacker called upon his connections to achieve a merger of Eastern Air Transport with Florida Airways, forming Eastern Air Lines. In early 1935, Rickenbacker became general manager of Eastern Air Lines. In April 1938, after learning that GM was considering selling Eastern to John D. Hertz, Rickenbacker met with GM&#x27;s chairman of the board, Alfred P. Sloan, and bought the company for $3.5 million.

Under his leadership, Eastern Air Lines grew from a company flying a few thousand miles per week into a major airline. Rickenbacker oversaw many radical changes in the field of commercial aviation. He negotiated with the U.S. government to acquire air mail routes, a great advantage to companies that needed regular income. He helped develop and support new aircraft designs. Rickenbacker bought larger and faster airliners, including the four-engine Lockheed Constellation and Douglas DC-4. He also collaborated with pioneers of aviation design, including Donald W. Douglas, the founder of the Douglas Aircraft Company and the designer and builder of the DC-4, DC-6, DC-7, and DC-8 (its first jet airliner).

=== Comic strips ===

Rickenbacker scripted the popular Sunday comic strip, &quot;Ace Drummond,&quot; from 1935 to 1940 for King Features Syndicate. He worked with aviation artist and author Clayton Knight, who illustrated the series. The strip followed the adventures of barnstormer Drummond as he traveled around the world and defeated evil-doers. The comic was cross-promoted through Rickenbacker&#x27;s Junior Pilots Club which distributed buttons featuring &quot;Ace Drummond&quot; characters. &quot;Ace Drummond&quot; was adapted into a film serial, a radio program, and a Big Little Book, &quot;Ace Drummond (&quot;Whitman Publishing Co., 1935).

Between 1935 and 1940, Knight and Rickenbacker created another Sunday comic strip for King Features. Called &quot;The Hall of Fame of the Air&quot;, this fact-based comic featured airplanes and air battles of famous aviators and aces. As one modern writer noted, &quot;Whether &#x27;America&#x27;s Ace of Aces&#x27; wrote the pieces or not; his name added authenticity to the strip.&quot; This comic strip was adapted into a Big Little Book, &quot;Hall of Fame of the Air,&quot; by Whitman Publishing Co. in 1936.

== World War II ==

=== Support for Britain ===

Rickenbacker supported the war effort as a civilian. While initially supporting the isolationist movement, Rickenbacker officially left the America First organization in 1940, having been a member for a few months. He then took an outspoken pro-British stance. He was inspired by &quot;England&#x27;s heroic resistance to relentless air attacks&quot; from the Luftwaffe&#x27;s campaign during the Battle of Britain in 1940, writing: &quot;Should these gallant British withstand the terrific onslaught of the totalitarian states until the summer of 1941, it is my sincere conviction that by that time this nation will have declared war.&quot;

Rickenbacker was one of a few celebrities who participated in campaigns to rally World War I veterans to the British cause before the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1942, he toured training bases in the southwestern United States and England. He encouraged the American public to contribute time and resources and pledged Eastern Air Lines equipment and personnel for use in military activities. Under Rickenbacker&#x27;s direction, Eastern Air Lines flew munitions and supplies across the Atlantic to the British.

In 1942, with a letter of authorization from Henry L. Stimson, U.S. Secretary of War, Rickenbacker visited England on an official war mission and made ground-breaking recommendations for better war operations. He inspected troops, operations, and equipment, serving in a publicity role to increase support from civilians and soldiers. Later, he worked with both the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces on bombing strategy, including work with air chief marshal Sir Arthur Harris and general Carl Andrew Spaatz.

=== Adrift at sea ===

In October 1942, Stimson sent Rickenbacker on a tour of air bases in the Pacific Theater of Operations to review living conditions and operations. In addition, he was to deliver a secret message from the president to General Douglas MacArthur. After visiting several air and sea bases in Hawaii, Rickenbacker was provided with a B-17D Flying Fortress (AAF Ser. No. &quot;40-3089&quot;) as transportation to the South Pacific. Due to faulty navigation equipment, the bomber strayed hundreds of miles off course while on its way to a refueling stop on Canton Island. When the airplane ran out of fuel, the pilot, Captain William T. Cherry Jr., was forced to ditch or water land the airplane in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean.

For 24 days, Rickenbacker, Army Captain Hans C. Adamson (his friend and business partner), and six crewmen drifted for thousands of miles at sea in life rafts. Adamson sustained serious injuries during the ditching. The other crewmen—John Bartek, Wiliam Cherry, John De Angelis, Alexander Kaczmarczyk, James Reynolds, and James Whittaker—were hurt to varying degrees. Their food supply ran out after three days. On the eighth day, a tern landed on Rickenbacker&#x27;s head. He captured it, and the bird became both a meal for the men and fishing bait. They survived on sporadic rainwater and small fish that they caught with their bare hands. While suffering from dehydration, Kaczmarczyk drank seawater; he died after two weeks adrift and was buried at sea.

The U.S. Army Air Forces and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s patrol planes planned to abandon the search for the lost B-17 crewmen after just over two weeks, but Rickenbacker&#x27;s wife convinced them to search for another week. However, the newspapers and radio reported that Rickenbacker was dead.

The surviving men split up. Cherry rowed off in the small raft and was rescued on day 23. Reynolds, De Angelis, and Whittaker found a small island that was close to an inhabited island where the natives were hosting an allied radio station. A U.S. Navy patrol OS2U-3 Kingfisher float-plane rescued the survivors on November 13, 1942, in the Ellice Island chain (now Tuvalu). All were suffering from exposure, sunburn, dehydration, and near starvation. He had lost , but after a few days of rest, Rickenbacker completed his assignment and delivered his message to General MacArthur.

The failure in the airplane&#x27;s navigation was blamed on an out-of-adjustment bubble octant that gave a systematic bias to all of its readings. The octant suffered a severe shock in a failed takeoff attempt in a different bomber. When the bomber&#x27;s landing gear brakes seized, the crew unknowingly moved the damaged bubble octant to Rickenbacker&#x27;s plane. This ditching spurred the development of improved navigational instruments and also better survival gear for the air crewmen.

In 1943, Rickenbacker wrote &quot;Seven Came Through&quot; about his experience, saying he was lost for 21 days. He corrected the number to 24 days in his 1967 autobiography.

=== 1943 mission to the USSR ===

Still determined to support the war effort, Rickenbacker suggested a fact-finding mission in the Soviet Union to provide the Soviets with technical assistance with their American aircraft. To get approval for this trip, Rickenbacker approached Soviet diplomats, rather than President Roosevelt. By trading favors with the Soviet ambassador and with Stimson&#x27;s help, Rickenbacker secured permission to travel to the Soviet Union. Stimson assigned Rickenbacker to visit the bases and production facilities in the Aleutian Islands, Burma, China, India, the Middle East, North Africa, and the Soviet Union. The War Department provided everything Rickenbacker needed, including a highly unusual letter giving the bearer permission to &quot;visit...any...areas he may deem necessary for such purposes as he will explain to you in person&quot;, signed by the Secretary of War.

In April 1943, Rickenbacker began his trip, traveling to Cairo, Egypt, in a United States Army Air Forces C-54 provided by General Henry H. Arnold. Rickenbacker made observations at every stop and reviewed American operations with a critical eye, forwarding reports to authorities. From Cairo, he traveled by C-87 to India to experience the Hump airlift into China—he reported unfavorably on the Hump airlift to Arnold after his return to the United States. Continuing into China, Rickenbacker was impressed by the determination of the Chinese people but disgusted with the corruption of the Kuomintang government. Next, he went to Iran and, from there, to the Soviet Union.

In the Soviet Union, Rickenbacker observed wartime conditions, the dedication and patriotism of the Russians, and the denial of food to those deemed unproductive to the war effort. He befriended many Soviet officials and shared his knowledge of the aircraft they had received from the United States. He was lavishly entertained by the Soviets and recalled attempts by NKVD agents to get him intoxicated enough to disclose sensitive information.

Rickenbacker&#x27;s mission was successful. A commander of Moscow&#x27;s defense had stayed at Rickenbacker&#x27;s home in 1937, and this personal connection aided his information-gathering. He learned about Soviet defense strategies and capabilities. When the Battle of Kursk started, he took advantage of the Soviets&#x27; distraction, viewing and memorizing a map that detailed the locations of Soviet military units at the front. He also persuaded his hosts to give him an unprecedented tour of the Shturmovik aircraft factory. However, Rickenbacker made comments during his trip that alerted the Soviets to the existence of the secret B-29 Superfortress program.

After Rickenbacker visited the Soviet Union, British prime minister Winston Churchill interviewed him. In the United States, Rickenbacker&#x27;s information resulted in some diplomatic and military action; however, the president did not meet with him. For his support of the war effort, Rickenbacker received the Medal for Merit from the United States government.

== Postwar ==

For a time, Eastern was the most profitable airline in the postwar era. During the late 1950s, however, Eastern Air Lines&#x27; fortunes declined. Rickenbacker was forced out of his position as CEO on October 1, 1959. At the age of 73, Rickenbacker also resigned as the chairman of the board on December 31, 1963.

In the 1960s, Rickenbacker became a well-known speaker. He shared his vision for the future of technology and commerce, exhorting Americans to respect the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but still uphold American values. He also endorsed many conservative ideas.

In 1967, Rickenbacker published his autobiography, giving a special edition to the employees of Eastern Air Lines.

== Personal life ==

Rickenbacker met Adelaide Frost Durant in Los Angeles before World War I. At the time, she was married to Clifford Durant, a racing competitor of Rickenbacker and the hard-partying son of William Durant of General Motors fame. Durant was also an abusive husband. Adelaide chose to get a hysterectomy to ensure she would bear him no children. Her father-in-law stepped in to allow her to live independently, buying her a comfortable home and giving her $220,000 in equities, half being GM stock.

Rickenbacker saw Adelaide again in New York in 1921 and was smitten. She finalized her divorce in July 1922, and the two were married on September 16, 1922, in Cumberland Presbyterian Church of South Beach, Connecticut. Following a seven-week honeymoon in Europe, the newlyweds set up home at Indian Village Manor in Detroit, Michigan. They adopted two boys: David Edward in 1925, and William Frost in 1928. Before the second adoption, the couple purchased a home in Grosse Pointe. In 1931, the family moved to Bronxville, New York. New York City was Rickenbacker&#x27;s favored home base and remained the couple&#x27;s primary residence for the rest of their lives, along with their second home in Key Biscayne. They also owned a ranch in Kerr County, Texas, in the 1950s. Both of their sons attended the Asheville School, where Rickenbacker served on the board of trustees.

On February 26, 1941, Rickenbacker was a passenger on Eastern Air Lines Flight 21 on a Douglas DC-3 airliner that crashed outside Atlanta, Georgia. The survivors were rescued after spending the night at the crash site. Rickenbacker barely survived being soaked in fuel and trapped in the wreckage. The press mistakenly announced his death.

In his autobiography, Rickenbacker gave a dramatic retelling of the incident. While he was still conscious and in terrible pain, he was left behind while some ambulances carried away the bodies of the dead. When he arrived at the hospital, his injuries were so severe that the emergency surgeons and physicians left him for dead for some time. The doctors instructed their assistants to &quot;take care of the live ones&quot;. Rickenbacker&#x27;s injuries included a fractured skull, a shattered left elbow with a crushed nerve, a paralyzed left hand, several broken ribs, a crushed hip socket, a pelvis broken in two places, a severed nerve in his left hip, a broken left knee, and his left eyeball was out of its socket. He was in critical condition at Atlanta&#x27;s Piedmont Hospital for ten days. After four months in the hospital, followed by months of home care, Rickenbacker healed from his injuries and regained his full eyesight. Rickenbacker later noted the supreme act of will that it took to stave off dying.

Rickenbacker was an avid golfer, often playing at the Siwanoy Country Club course near his home in Bronxville. He is one of a very select few members who were granted honorary lifetime membership. He was also a member of the Los Angeles Elks Lodge #99. After he left Eastern Airlines, the Rickenbackers traveled for several years in the Orient.

In 1972, Rickenbacker had a stroke that left him in a coma for a short time. He recovered and traveled to Zürich, Switzerland, in July 1973, seeking medical treatments for his wife&#x27;s failing vision. While in Zürich, Rickenbacker contracted pneumonia and died at the age of 82. His memorial service was held at the Key Biscayne Presbyterian Church with the eulogy given by Lt. General Jimmy Doolittle. He was interred in Columbus, Ohio, at Green Lawn Cemetery. When he died, Rickenbacker was the last living Medal of Honor recipient from the United States Army Air Service.

In 1977, Adelaide was blind, in failing health, and still grieving severely from the loss of her husband. She died by suicide via gunshot at their home in Key Biscayne, Florida, at the age of 92.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Sir Francis Edward Younghusband, (31 May 1863 – 31 July 1942) was a British Army officer, explorer and spiritual writer. He is remembered for his travels in the Far East and Central Asia; especially the 1904 British expedition to Tibet, led by himself, and for his writings on Asia and foreign policy. Younghusband held positions including British commissioner to Tibet and president of the Royal Geographical Society.

== Early life ==
Francis Younghusband was born in 1863 at Murree, British India (now Pakistan), to a British military family, being the brother of Major-General George Younghusband and the second son of Major-General John W. Younghusband and his wife Clara Jane Shaw. Clara&#x27;s brother, Robert Shaw, was a noted explorer of Central Asia. His uncle Lieutenant-General Charles Younghusband CB FRS, was a British Army officer and meteorologist.

As an infant, Francis was taken to live in England by his mother. When Clara returned to India in 1867 she left her son in the care of two austere and strictly religious aunts. In 1870 his mother and father returned to England and reunited the family. In 1876 at age thirteen, Francis entered Clifton College, Bristol. In 1881 he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned as a subaltern in the 1st King&#x27;s Dragoon Guards in May 1882.

== Military career ==
Having read General MacGregor&#x27;s book &quot;Defence of India&quot; he could have justifiably called himself an expert on the &quot;Great Game&quot; of espionage that was unfolding on the Steppes of Asia. In 1886–1887, on leave from his regiment, Younghusband made an expedition across Asia though still a young officer. After sailing to China his party set out, with Colonel Mark Bell&#x27;s permission, to cross 1200 miles of desert with the ostensible authority to survey the geography; but in reality, the purposes were to ascertain the strength of the Russian physical threats to the Raj. Departing Peking with a senior colleague, Henry E. M. James (on leave from his Indian Civil Service position) and a young British consular officer from Newchwang, Harry English Fulford, on 4 April 1887, Lieut Younghusband explored Manchuria, visiting the frontier areas of Chinese settlement in the region of the Changbai Mountains.

On arrival in India, he was granted three months&#x27; leave by the Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Lord Roberts; the scientific results of this travel would prove vital information to the Royal Geographical Society. Younghusband had already carried out numerous scientific observations in particular, showing that the Changbai Mountains&#x27; highest peak, Baekdu Mountain, is only around 8,000 feet tall, even though the travellers&#x27; British maps showed [nonexistent] snow-capped peaks 10,000-12,000 ft tall in the area. Fulford provided the travellers with language and cultural expertise. Younghusband crossed the most inhospitable terrain in the world to the Himalayas before being ordered to make his way home. Parting with his British companions, he crossed the Taklamakan Desert to Chinese Turkestan, and pioneered a route from Kashgar to India through the uncharted Mustagh Pass. He reported to the Viceroy, Lord Dufferin, his crossing through the Karakoram Range, the Hindu Kush, the Pamirs and where the range converged with the Himalayas; the nexus of three great empires. In the 1880s the region of the Upper Oxus was still largely unmapped. For this achievement, aged still only 24, he was elected the youngest member of the Royal Geographical Society and received the society&#x27;s 1890 Patron&#x27;s Medal.
In February 1889, he was made captain and was dispatched with a small escort of Gurkha soldiers to investigate an uncharted region north of Ladakh, where raiders from Hunza had disrupted trade between Yarkand and India the previous year. Whilst encamped in the valley of the Yarkand River, Younghusband received a messenger at his camp, inviting him to dinner with Captain Bronislav Grombchevsky, his Russian counterpart in &quot;The Great Game&quot;. Younghusband accepted the invitation to Grombchevsky&#x27;s camp, and after dinner the two rivals talked into the night, sharing brandy and vodka, and discussing the possibility of a Russian invasion of British India. Grombchevsky impressed Younghusband with the horsemanship skills of his Cossack escort, and Younghusband impressed Grombchevsky with the rifle drill of his Gurkhas. After their meeting in this remote frontier region, Grombchevsky resumed his expedition in the direction of Tibet and Younghusband continued his exploration of the Karakoram.

== Indian Political Service career ==
Younghusband received a telegram from Simla, to attend the Intelligence Department (ID) to be interviewed by Foreign Secretary Sir Mortimer Durand, transferred to the Indian Political Service. He served as a political officer on secondment from the British Army. He refused a request to visit Lhasa as an interpreter, disguised as a Yarkandi trader, a cover not guaranteed to fool the Russians, after Andrew Dalgleish, a Scots merchant, had been hacked to death. Younghusband was accompanied by a Gurkha escort, celebrated for their ferocity in combat. The Forward policy was circumscribed by a legal offer to all travellers of peaceable security crossing borders. Departure from Leh on 8 August 1889 on the caravan route took them up the mountain pass of Shimshal towards Hunza, his aim being to restore the tea trade to Xinjiang and prevent any further raids into Kashmir. Colonel Durand from Gilgit joined him. Younghusband probed the villages to gauge the reception: calculating it was a den of thieves, they ascended the steep ravine. The Hunza was barred to them, a trap was sprung; the parley terms took him inside to negotiate. The nervous reception over, they were all relieved to find safety; Younghusband wanted to know who was waylaying innocent civilian traders, and why. The ruler, Safdar Ali extended a letter of welcome to his Kashmiri kingdom; the British investigated whence came the Russian infiltrators under Agent Gromchevsky. Further south at Ladakh, he kept a close watch on their movements. Reluctantly, Younghusband dined with the Cossack leaders, who divulged the secrets of their common rivalry. Gromchevsky explained that the Raj had invited enmity for meddling in the Black Sea ports. The Russian displayed little grasp of strategy, but basic raw courage; he betrayed the confidence of Abdul Rahman as no friend to the British. Younghusband tentatively concluded that their possessions at Bokhara and Samarkand were vulnerable. Having drunk large quantities of vodka and brandy, the Cossacks presented arms in cordial salute and they parted in peace. Woefully unprepared for winter, the British garrison at Ladakh refused them entry.

Younghusband finally arrived at Gulmit to a 13-gun salute. In khaki, the envoy greeted Safdar Ali at the marquee on the Karakoram Highway, the men of Hunza kneeling at their ruler&#x27;s feet. This was colonial diplomacy, based on protocol and etiquette, but Younghusband had not come for merely trivial discussions. Reinforced by Durand&#x27;s troops, Younghusband&#x27;s arguments were to prevent criminal looting, murder, and highway robbery. Impervious to reason though Safdar Ali was, Younghusband was not prepared to allow him to laugh at the Raj. A demonstration of firepower &quot;caused quite a sensation&quot;, he wrote in his diaries. The British major was disdainful, but content when he left on 23 November to return to India, which he reached by Christmas.

In 1890, Younghusband was sent on a mission to Chinese Turkestan, accompanied by George Macartney as interpreter. He spent the winter in Kashgar, where he left Macartney as British consul. Younghusband sought to investigate the Pamir Gap, a possible Russian entry route to India, but first needed to address issues with the Chinese authorities in Kashgar. It was for this reason he recruited a Mandarin interpreter, junior officer George Macartney, to accompany his missions into the frozen mountains. They wintered in Kashgar as a listening post, meeting in conference with the Russian Nikolai Petrovsky, who had always resisted trade with Xinjiang (Sinkiang). The Russian agent was well-informed about British India, but proved unscrupulous. Believing he had succeeded, Younghusband did not reckon on Petrovsky&#x27;s deal with the &quot;Taotai&quot; of Xinjiang.

In July 1891, they were still in the Pamirs when news reached them that the Russians intended to send troops &quot;to note and report with the Chinese and Afghans&quot;. At Bozai Gumbaz in the Little Pamir on 12 August he encountered Cossack soldiers, who forced him to leave the area. This was one of the incidents which provoked the Hunza-Nagar Campaign. The troop of 20 or so soldiers planted a flag on what they anticipated was unclaimed territory, 150 miles south of the Russian border. However, the British considered the area to be Afghan territory. Colonel Yonov, decorated with the Order of St George, approached his camp to announce that the area now belonged to the Tsar. Younghusband learnt that they had raided the Chitral territory; furthermore, they had penetrated the Darkot Pass into the Yasin Valley. They were joined by eager intelligence officer Lieutenant Davison, but the British were disabused by Ivanov of British sovereignty: Younghusband remained polite, maintained protocol but hospitable to the big Russian bear hug.

During his service in Kashmir, he wrote a book called &quot;Kashmir&quot; at the request of Edward M. J. Molyneux. Younghusband&#x27;s descriptions went hand in glove with Molyneux&#x27;s paintings of the valley. In the book, Younghusband declared his immense admiration of the natural beauty of Kashmir and its history. Younghusband participated in the geopolitical rivalry between Britain and Russia, known as &#x27;The Great Game,&#x27; which persisted into the 20th century before being formally concluded by the 1907 Anglo-Russian Treaty. Younghusband, among other explorers such as Sven Hedin, Nikolay Przhevalsky, Shoqan Walikhanov and Sir Marc Aurel Stein, had participated in earnest. Rumours of Russian expansion into the Hindu Kush with a Russian presence in Tibet prompted the new Viceroy of India Lord Curzon to appoint Younghusband, by then a major, British commissioner to Tibet from 1902 to 1904.

=== Expedition to Tibet ===
In 1903, Curzon appointed Younghusband as the head of the Tibet Frontier Commission; John Claude White, the political officer of Sikkim, and E. C. Wilton, served as his deputy commissioners in the commission. Younghusband subsequently led the British expedition to Tibet, which had the putative aim to settle disputes over the Sikkim–Tibet border, but eventually exceeded instructions from the government of the United Kingdom and became a &quot;de facto&quot; invasion of Tibet. Roughly inside Tibet, on the way to Gyantse, thence to the capital of Lhasa, a confrontation outside the hamlet of Guru led to a victory by the expedition&#x27;s troops over 600–700 Tibetan soldiers. The expedition&#x27;s troops, equipped with rifles and machine guns, overpowered the less-equipped Tibetan forces, who were armed with hoes, swords, and flintlocks. 

Ultimately, 202 men of Younghusband&#x27;s expedition were killed in action while 411 died of non-combat causes. The expedition was supported by Ugyen Wangchuck of the Kingdom of Bhutan (who was to become the King of Bhutan in 1907), who was knighted in return for his services. However, the invasion of Tibet embarrassed the British government, which desired good relations with the Qing dynasty for the sake of Britain&#x27;s trade with Chinese coastal settlements. Accordingly, the British government repudiated the Treaty of Lhasa, signed by Younghusband and Tibetan leaders, due to concerns over its impact on relations with the Qing dynasty and trade with Chinese coastal regions.

In 1891, Younghusband received the Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire, and then he was awarded the honour of Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India in December 1904. He was also awarded the Kaisar-I-Hind Medal (gold) in 1901, and the Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1905. In 1906, Younghusband settled in Kashmir as the British Resident representative before returning to Britain in 1909, where he was an active member of many clubs and societies. In 1908, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. During the First World War, his patriotic Fight for Right campaign commissioned the song &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.

== Himalaya and mountaineering ==

In 1889, Younghusband reached base of Turkestan La (North) from north, and he noted that this was a long glacier and a major Central Asian dividing range.

In 1919, Younghusband was elected President of the Royal Geographical Society, and two years later became Chairman of the Mount Everest Committee which was set up to coordinate the initial 1921 British Reconnaissance Expedition to Mount Everest. Younghusband supported efforts to summit Mount Everest and endorsed George Mallory&#x27;s participation in early expeditions, and they followed the same initial route as the earlier Tibet Mission. Younghusband remained Chairman through the subsequent 1922 and 1924 British Expeditions.

In 1938, Younghusband encouraged Ernst Schäfer, who was about to lead a German expedition, to &quot;sneak over the border&quot; when faced with British intransigence towards Schäfer&#x27;s efforts to reach Tibet.

== Personal life ==
In 1897 Younghusband married Helen Augusta Magniac, the daughter of Charles Magniac, MP. Augusta&#x27;s brother, Vernon, served as Younghusband&#x27;s private secretary during the expedition to Tibet. The Younghusbands had a son who died in infancy, and a daughter, Eileen Younghusband (1902–1981), who became a prominent social worker.

From 1921 to 1937 the couple lived at Westerham, Kent, but Helen did not accompany her husband on his travels. In July 1942 Younghusband suffered a stroke after addressing a meeting of the World Congress of Faiths in Birmingham. He died of cardiac failure on 31 July 1942 at Madeline Lees&#x27; home Post Green House, at Lytchett Minster, Dorset. He was buried in the village churchyard.

== Spiritual life ==

Biographer Patrick French described Younghusband&#x27;s religious belief as one who was
brought up an Evangelical Christian, read his way into Tolstoyan simplicity, experienced a revelatory vision in the mountains of Tibet, toyed with telepathy in Kashmir, proposed a new faith based on virile racial theory, then transformed it into what Bertrand Russell called &#x27;a religion of atheism.&#x27; Ultimately he became a spiritualist and &quot;premature hippie&quot; who &quot;had great faith in the power of cosmic rays, and claimed that there are extraterrestrials with translucent flesh on the planet Altair.&quot;

Younghusband described having a mystical experience during his retreat from Tibet, which he said instilled him with a profound sense of &#x27;love for the whole world and convinced him that &quot;men at heart are divine&quot;. This conviction was tinged with regret for the invasion of Tibet, and eventually, in 1936, profound religious convictions invited a founder&#x27;s address to the World Congress of Faiths (in imitation of the World Parliament of Religions). Younghusband published a number of books with titles including &quot;The Gleam: Being an account of the life of Nija Svabhava, pseud.&quot; (1923); &quot;Mother World (in Travail for the Christ that is to be)&quot; (1924); and &quot;Life in the Stars: An Exposition of the View that on some Planets of some Stars exist Beings higher than Ourselves, and on one a World-Leader, the Supreme Embodiment of the Eternal Spirit which animates the Whole&quot; (1927). The last drew the admiration of Lord Baden-Powell, the Boy Scouts founder. Younghusband explored speculative concepts such as pantheism, a Christlike &#x27;world leader&#x27; residing on the planet &#x27;Altair,&#x27; and ideas reminiscent of the Gaia hypothesis, exploring the theology of spiritualism, and guidance by means of telepathy.

In his book &quot;Within: Thoughts During Convalescence&quot; (1912), Younghusband stated:

We are giving up the idea that the Kingdom of God is in Heaven, and we are finding that the Kingdom of God is within us. We are relinquishing the old idea of an external God, above, apart, and separate from ourselves; and we are taking on the new idea of an internal spirit working within us – a constraining, immanent influence, a vital, propelling impulse vibrating through us all, expressing itself and fulfilling its purpose through us, and uniting us together in one vast spiritual unity.

Younghusband explored Eastern philosophy and Theosophy advocating for a non-anthropomorphic understanding of divinity. Taking influence from Henri Bergson&#x27;s &quot;Creative Evolution&quot;, he proposed purpose in the cosmos through a creative life force. Younghusband&#x27;s philosophy of cosmic spiritual evolution was outlined in his books &quot;Life in the Stars&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Living Universe&quot; (1933). In the latter book he proposed the idea that the universe is a living organism. Younghusband held the view that spiritual forces in the universe are directing evolution and producing life and intelligence on many different planets. Younghusband&#x27;s philosophical ideas, such as cosmic spiritual evolution, received limited acceptance within the scientific community. He founded the World Congress of Faiths to promote dialogue between different religions.

Younghusband allegedly believed in free love (&quot;freedom to unite when and how a man and a woman please&quot;), marriage laws examined as a matter of &quot;outdated custom&quot;.

Association with Paramahansa Yogananda:
In July 1935, Sir Francis Younghusband introduced the Indian yogi and spiritual teacher, Paramahansa Yogananda, during a lecture at Caxton Hall in London. This event is detailed in Yogananda’s “Autobiography of a Yogi,” where he describes his interactions with Younghusband. ￼

=== Fictional portrayal ===
One of Younghusband&#x27;s domestic servants, Gladys Aylward, became a Christian missionary in China. The Ingrid Bergman film &quot;The Inn of the Sixth Happiness&quot; (1958) is based on Gladys Aylward&#x27;s life, with Ronald Squire portraying Younghusband.

<text>A barque, barc, or bark is a type of sailing vessel with three or more masts of which the fore mast, mainmast, and any additional masts are rigged square, and only the aftmost mast (mizzen in three-masted barques) is rigged fore and aft. Sometimes, the mizzen is only partly fore-and-aft rigged, bearing a square-rigged sail above.

== Etymology==
The word &quot;barque&quot; entered English via the French term, which in turn came from the Latin &quot;barca&quot; by way of Occitan, Catalan, Spanish, or Italian.

The Latin may stem from Celtic &quot;barc&quot; (per Thurneysen) or Greek &quot;baris&quot; (per Diez), a term for an Egyptian boat. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, however, considers the latter improbable.

The word &quot;barc&quot; appears to have come from Celtic languages. The form adopted by English, perhaps from Irish, was &quot;bark&quot;, while that adopted by Latin as very early, which gave rise to the French and .

In Latin, Spanish, and Italian, the term &quot;barca&quot; refers to a small boat, not a full-sized ship. French influence in England led to the use in English of both words, although their meanings now are not the same.

Well before the 19th century, a barge had become interpreted as a small vessel of coastal or inland waters, or a fast rowing boat carried by warships and normally reserved for the commanding officer. Somewhat later, a bark became a sailing vessel of a distinctive rig as detailed below. In Britain, by the mid-19th century, the spelling had taken on the French form of &quot;barque&quot;. Although Francis Bacon used the spelling with a &quot;q&quot; as early as 1592, Shakespeare still used the spelling &quot;barke&quot; in Sonnet 116 in 1609. Throughout the period of sail, the word was used also as a shortening of the barca-longa of the Mediterranean Sea.

The usual modern spelling convention is that, to distinguish between homophones, when spelled as barque it refers to a ship, and when spelled as bark it refers to either a sound or to a tree hide.

&quot;Barcarole&quot; in music shares the same etymology, being originally a folk song sung by Venetian gondoliers and derived from &quot;barca&quot;—&quot;boat&quot; in Italian, or in Late Latin.

==Bark==
In the 18th century, the Royal Navy used the term bark for a nondescript vessel that did not fit any of its usual categories. Thus, when the British admiralty purchased a collier for use by James Cook in his journey of exploration, she was registered as to distinguish her from another &quot;Endeavour&quot;, a sloop already in service at the time. &quot;Endeavour&quot; happened to be a full-rigged ship with a plain bluff bow and a full stern with windows.

William Falconer&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of the Marine&quot; defined &quot;bark&quot;, as &quot;a general name given to small ships: it is however peculiarly appropriated by seamen to those which carry three masts without a mizzen topsail. Our Northern Mariners, who are trained in the coal-trade, apply this distinction to a broad-sterned ship, which carries no ornamental figure on the stem or prow.&quot;

A 16th-century paper document in the Cheshire and Chester Archives and Local Studies Service notes the names of Robert Ratclyfe, owner of the bark &quot;Sunday&quot; and 10 mariners appointed to serve under the Earl of Sussex, Lord Deputy of Ireland.

==Barque rig==
By the end of the 18th century, the term barque (sometimes, particularly in the US, spelled bark) came to refer to any vessel with a particular type of sail plan. This comprises three (or more) masts, fore-and-aft sails on the aftermost mast and square sails on all other masts. Barques were the workhorse of the golden age of sail in the mid-19th century as they attained passages that nearly matched full-rigged ships, but could operate with smaller crews.

The advantage of these rigs was that they needed smaller (therefore cheaper) crews than a comparable full-rigged ship or brig-rigged vessel, as fewer of the labour-intensive square sails were used, and the rig itself is cheaper. Conversely, the ship rig tended to be retained for training vessels where the larger the crew, the more seamen were trained.

Another advantage is that, downwind, a barque can outperform a schooner or barkentine, and is both easier to handle and better at going to windward than a full-rigged ship. While a full-rigged ship is the best runner available, and while fore-and-aft rigged vessels are the best at going to windward, the barque and the barquentine, are compromises, which combine, in different proportions, the best elements of these two.

Whether square-rig, barque, barquentine or schooner is optimal depends on the degree to which the sailing-route and season can be chosen to achieve following-wind. Square-riggers predominated for intercontinental sailing on routes chosen for following-winds.

Most ocean-going windjammers were four-masted barques, due to the above-described considerations and compromises. Usually the main mast was the tallest; that of &quot;Moshulu&quot; extends to 58 m off the deck. The four-masted barque can be handled with a surprisingly small crew—at minimum, 10—and while the usual crew was around 30, almost half of them could be apprentices.
Today many sailing-school ships are barques.

A well-preserved example of a commercial barque is the &quot;Pommern&quot;, the only windjammer in original condition. Its home is in Mariehamn outside the Åland maritime museum. The wooden barque &quot;Sigyn&quot;, built in Gothenburg 1887, is now a museum ship in Turku. The wooden whaling barque &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot;, launched 1841, taken out of service 1921, is now a museum ship at Mystic Seaport in Connecticut. The &quot;Charles W. Morgan&quot; has recently been refit and is (as of summer, 2014) sailing the New England coast. The United States Coast Guard still has an operational barque, built in Germany in 1936 and captured as a war prize, the USCGC &quot;Eagle&quot;, which the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London uses as a training vessel. The Sydney Heritage Fleet restored an iron-hulled three-masted barque, the &quot;James Craig&quot;, originally constructed as &quot;Clan Macleod&quot; in 1874 and sailing at sea fortnightly. The oldest active sailing vessel in the world, the &quot;Star of India&quot;, was built in 1863 as a full-rigged ship, then converted into a barque in 1901.

This type of ship inspired the French composer Maurice Ravel to write his famous piece, &quot;Une Barque sur l&#x27;ocean&quot;, originally composed for piano, in 1905, then orchestrated in 1906.

&quot;Statsraad Lehmkuhl&quot; is in active operation in its barque form, stripped down without most of its winches and later improvements more aligned to the upbringing of future sailors both as a schoolship, training operations for the Norwegian Navy and generally available for interested volunteers. During the summer of 2021, it hosted &quot;NRK Sommarskuta&quot; with live TV everyday sailing all of the Norwegian coast from north to south and crossing the North Sea to Shetland. After this it will perform its first full sailing trip around world, estimated to take 19 months with many promotional events along the way. Scientific equipment has been installed in support of ongoing university studies to monitor and log environmental data.

==Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt==
In Ancient Egypt, barques, referred to using the French word as Egyptian hieroglyphs were first translated by the Frenchman Jean-François Champollion, were a type of boat used from Egypt&#x27;s earliest recorded times and are depicted in many drawings, paintings, and reliefs that document the culture. Transportation to the afterlife was believed to be accomplished by way of barques, as well, and the image is used in many of the religious murals and carvings in temples and tombs.

The most important Egyptian barque carried the dead pharaoh to become a deity. Great care was taken to provide a beautiful barque to the pharaoh for this journey, and models of the boats were placed in their tombs. Many models of these boats, that range from tiny to huge in size, have been found. Wealthy and royal members of the culture also provided barques for their final journey. The type of vessel depicted in Egyptian images remains quite similar throughout the thousands of years the culture persisted.

Barques were important religious artifacts, and since the deities were thought to travel in this fashion in the sky, the Milky Way was seen as a great waterway that was as important as the Nile on Earth; cult statues of the deities traveled by boats on water and ritual boats were carried about by the priests during festival ceremonies. Temples included barque shrines, sometimes more than one in a temple, in which the sacred barques rested when a procession was not in progress. In these stations, the boats would be watched over and cared for by the priests.

==Barque of St. Peter==

The Barque of St. Peter, or the Barque of Peter, is a reference to the Roman Catholic Church. The term refers to Peter, the first Pope, who was a fisherman before becoming an apostle of Jesus. The Pope is often said to be steering the Barque of St. Peter.

<doc id="183610" wikidata="Q607328" url="?curid=183610" title="The Hanging Garden (film)">
<text>The Hanging Garden is a British-Canadian drama film, written and directed by Thom Fitzgerald and released in 1997. Fitzgerald&#x27;s feature debut, the film was shot in Nova Scotia.

==Plot==

The film&#x27;s central character is Sweet William, as both a thin adult and a fat teenager. Its plot hinges on a fateful incident from his teenage years, when his grandmother caught him attempting to have sex with his bisexual friend Fletcher, involuntarily outing him to his dysfunctional family as gay.

As a consequence of the ensuing rejection, particularly by his alcoholic father Whiskey Mac, Sweet William faced the difficult decision of whether to run away to live in a big city far away from his family, or to commit suicide by hanging himself from a tree in the family garden. The film&#x27;s themes about the duality of life and death, and the way seemingly very different choices in life can lead to similar outcomes, are portrayed through magic realism in the film&#x27;s depiction of a complex merged reality in which William appears to have successfully made both choices at the same time.

The film is told as a triptych. In the first segment, set in the present, the adult Sweet William has returned home to rural Nova Scotia for the first time since leaving ten years earlier, to attend the wedding of his sister Rosemary to Fletcher. However, upon his return, he makes two unexpected discoveries: he can still see his younger selves living there and walking around the house, and he also has a new young pre-teen sister named Violet, whom he has never met because she was born after he left. The second segment, set in the past, tells the story of Sweet William&#x27;s teenage years leading up to the critical decision, including his bond with Rosemary and their mother Iris&#x27;s struggles to protect her children from Whiskey Mac&#x27;s abuse, as well as revealing the truth of Violet&#x27;s origins, before ending with Sweet William&#x27;s suicide. Returning to the present, the final segment features both the living adult and dead teenage Sweet William present in the same realityand the dead body is not just in his imagination, because the rest of his family can also see it still hanging from the tree.

According to Fitzgerald, &quot;To every event in the film there are two interpretations. He left home and now he&#x27;s back and his memory is haunting them. Or he did commit suicide when young and his homecoming is a fantasy?&quot;

== Cast ==
* Chris Leavins as adult Sweet William
** Troy Veinotte as teenage Sweet William
* Kerry Fox as Rosemary
** Sarah Polley as teenage Rosemary
* Joel Keller as Fletcher
* Peter MacNeill as Whiskey Mac
* Seana McKenna as Iris
* Christine Dunsworth as Violet
* Joan Orenstein as Grace
* Heather Rankin as Black-Eyed Susan
* Ashley MacIsaac as Basil, the wedding musician

==Critical reception==
Roger Ebert favourably reviewed the film, writing that &quot;It may be magic realism, but isn&#x27;t it also the simple truth? Don&#x27;t the ghosts of our former selves attend family events right along with our current manifestations? Don&#x27;t parents still sometimes relate to us as if we were children, don&#x27;t siblings still carry old resentments, aren&#x27;t old friends still stuck on who we used to be? And don&#x27;t we sometimes resurrect old personas and dust them off for a return engagement? Aren&#x27;t all of those selves stored away inside somewhere?&quot;

For &quot;Variety&quot;, Brendan Kelly wrote that &quot;&#x27;The Hanging Garden&#x27; is often in danger of seeming overly pretentious, but Fitzgerald wisely undercuts the formal artiness with strong, emotional storytelling. In many ways, this is a simple yarn of a son dealing with the usual family demons and, on that level, is an affecting piece of filmmaking. Beyond that, the mix of film-school formalism and down-to-earth drama makes the pic a unique offering.&quot;

In 2001, an industry poll conducted by &quot;Playback&quot; named it the 11th best Canadian film of the preceding 15 years.

==Awards==
The film premiered at the 1997 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the People&#x27;s Choice Award and was cowinner with Atom Egoyan&#x27;s &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; of the juried award for Best Canadian Film. It was only the second film in the history of the festival, following Denys Arcand&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the American Empire&quot; in 1986, to win both awards.

It subsequently screened at the Atlantic Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award, the Best Canadian Film Award, the Best Atlantic Film Award, Best Writing and Best Direction nods for Fitzgerald, Best Actor for Veinotte and Best Actress for Orenstein. It also won the awards for Best Canadian Film at the Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival, and at the Vancouver International Film Festival.

The film received 11 Genie Award nominations at the 18th Genie Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director (Fitzgerald), Best Supporting Actor (MacNeill), Best Supporting Actress (3: McKenna, Fox, Orenstein), Best Screenplay (Fitzgerald), Best Art Direction/Production Design (Taavo Soodor and Darlene Shiels), Best Costume Design (James A. Worthen), Best Overall Sound (Peter Harper, Phillipe Espantoso, George Hannan) and Best Editing (Susan Shanks). MacNeill and McKenna won the awards for Supporting Actor and Actress; Fitzgerald won for Best Screenplay, as well as winning the juried Claude Jutra Award for best first feature film.

The film was runner-up for the Rogers Best Canadian Film Award at the 1997 Toronto Film Critics Association Awards.

<text>Viburnum is a genus of about 150–175 species of flowering plants in the moschatel family, Adoxaceae. Its current classification is based on molecular phylogeny. It was previously included in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae.

The member species are evergreen or deciduous shrubs or (in a few cases) small trees native throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, with a few species extending into tropical montane regions in South America and southeast Asia. In Africa, the genus is confined to the Atlas Mountains.

==Name==
The generic name &quot;Viburnum&quot; originated in Latin, in which it referred to &quot;V. lantana&quot;.

==Description==
The leaves are opposite, simple, and entire, toothed or lobed; cool temperate species are deciduous, while most of the warm temperate species are evergreen. Some species are densely hairy on the shoots and leaves, with star-shaped hairs.

The flowers are produced in corymbs 5–15 cm across, each flower white to cream or pink, small, 3–5 mm across, with five petals, strongly fragrant in some species. The gynoecium has three connate carpels with the nectary on top of the gynoecium. Some species also have a fringe of large, showy sterile flowers around the perimeter of the corymb to act as a pollinator target.

The fruit is a spherical, oval, or somewhat flattened drupe, red to purple, blue, or black, and containing a single seed; some are edible for humans, but many others are mildly poisonous. The leaves are eaten by the larvae of many Lepidoptera species.

==Cultivation and uses==
Many species of viburnum have become popular as garden or landscape plants because of their showy flowers and berries, fragrance, and good autumn colour of some forms. Some popular species, hybrids, and cultivars include:
*The hybrid &quot;Viburnum&quot; × &quot;bodnantense&quot; (&quot;V. farreri&quot; × &quot;V. grandiflorum&quot;) is particularly popular for its strongly scented pink flowers on the leafless deciduous shoots in mid- to late winter.
*&quot;Viburnum&quot; × &quot;burkwoodii&quot; (&quot;V. carlesii&quot; × &quot;V. utile&quot;)
*&quot;Viburnum&quot; × &quot;carlcephalum&quot; (&quot;V. carlesii&quot; × &quot;V. macrocephalum&quot;)
*&quot;Viburnum carlesii&quot; has round white flowerheads, strong fragrance, dense structure, and reddish leaves in autumn.
*&quot;Viburnum davidii&quot; is an evergreen species from China with blue fruit.
*&quot;Viburnum dentatum&quot; has flat-topped flowers, bluish fruit, and reddish leaves in autumn. It is somewhat salt-tolerant. The cultivar &#x27;Blue Muffin&#x27; is more compact than the species and has fruit that are a deeper blue than the species.
*&quot;Viburnum dilatatum&quot; has flat-topped flowers, reddish leaves in autumn, and bright red fruit that persist into winter.
*&quot;Viburnum&quot; × &quot;jackii&quot; – Jack&#x27;s viburnum
*&quot;Viburnum × juddii&quot; (&quot;V. bitchiuense&quot; × &quot;V. carlesii&quot;)
*&quot;Viburnum plicatum&quot; has white flowers, textured leaves, reddish-black fruit, and can grow quite large under ideal conditions. The species can tolerate shade, but not drought.
*&quot;Viburnum × &quot; (&quot;V. rhytidophyllum&quot; × &quot;V. utile&quot;)
*&quot;Viburnum × rhytidophylloides&quot; (&quot;V. lantana&quot; × &quot;V. rhytidophyllum&quot;)popular evergreen shrub, drought resistant. Shiny green leafs, white flowers. 
*&quot;Viburnum rhytidophyllum&quot; is a popular evergreen species, grown mainly for its foliage effect of large, dark green leathery leaves with strongly wrinkled surface. This is the parent species of two popular hybrid cultivars known as &#x27;Alleghany&#x27; and &quot;. &#x27;Alleghany&#x27; was selected from a hybrid between &quot;V. rhytidophyllum&quot; and &quot;V. lantana&quot; &#x27;Mohican&#x27; (in 1958, at the US National Arboretum).
*&quot;Viburnum setigerum&quot; has upright, coarse structure and orange to reddish-orange fruit.
*&quot;Viburnum sieboldii&quot; has coarse, open structure, flat-topped flowers, reddish-black fruit, and can grow as a small tree.
*&quot;Viburnum tinus&quot; is a widely grown garden and landscape shrub.

The cultivars &quot; and &#x27;Eskimo&#x27;, of mixed or uncertain parentage, have won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Other uses===
In prehistory, the long, straight shoots of some viburnums were used for arrow-shafts, as those found with Ötzi the Iceman.

The fruit of some species (e.g. &quot;V. lentago&quot;) are edible and can be eaten either raw or for making jam, while other species (e.g. &quot;V. opulus&quot;) are mildly toxic and can cause vomiting if eaten in quantity.

The bark of some species is used in herbal medicine, as an antispasmodic and to treat asthma.

===Cultural references===
In Ukraine, &quot;Viburnum opulus&quot; is an important element of their traditional folk cultures, and &quot;Viburnum opulus&quot; (kalyna) is seen as a national symbol, an emblem for both the Koliada festivities and the concept of young girl&#x27;s love and tenderness. It is the key element of the Ukrainian traditional wreath. A number of folk songs are dedicated to kalyna as well as very popular song &quot;Oi u Luzi Chervona Kalina&quot;.

The Lithuanian name for the genus &quot;Viburnum&quot; is &quot;Putinas&quot;. This was the pen name of Lithuanian poet and writer Vincas Mykolaitis. In 2000, the Lithuanian liquor company Alita released a vodka named Putin Vodka, with a red, white, and blue label, which are the colours of the Russian flag. Sold only in Lithuania at that time, a company spokesperson said that the name had its origin in the tree &quot;putinas&quot;, after speculation arose that it was named after Russian president Vladimir Putin.

<text>The district of Aachen () is a district in the west of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Heinsberg, Düren, Euskirchen, and also the Netherlands province of Limburg and the Belgian province of Liège. Its administrative body is the &quot;Städteregionsparlament&quot; (&quot;regional parliament&quot;), headed by the &quot;Städteregionspräsident&quot; or &quot;region president&quot; (Tim Grüttemeier (CDU) since 2019).

As of 21 October 2009, the &quot;Städteregion Aachen&quot; (literally: &quot;cities region&quot; Aachen) was formed from the former district Aachen (&quot;Kreis Aachen&quot;) and the city of Aachen. This is the first &quot;Städteregion&quot; that was formed in North Rhine-Westphalia. Its status is similar to that of the district Hanover (&quot;Region Hannover&quot;) in Lower Saxony, in that the powers of the city of Aachen are slightly less than those of a district-free city (&quot;Kreisfreie Stadt&quot;).

== History ==

The &quot;Landkreis Aachen&quot; was formed in 1816 from the two French cantons Burtscheid and Eschweiler, with its capital set to the city of Burtscheid. In 1897 Burtscheid was incorporated into the city of Aachen, but the administrative seat stayed there, even though the capital was no longer part of the district.

=== Kreis Aachen (1972) ===
The Aachen district was re-formed in 1972, and part of it was incorporated to the district-free city of Aachen. At that point in time, the policy that no independent large city in North Rhine-Westphalia should be the seat of its district was not yet in effect. In the larger independent cities of Bielefeld (1973) and Münster (1975), the districts named after them were consistently dissolved and several of their communities were incorporated into the respective large city. In the case of Aachen, however, no further municipal reform was carried out and the separation of city and district remained. 

In 1975 this district of Aachen was merged with the district of Monschau, and parts of the districts of Düren, Jülich, Schleiden and Selfkant.

=== Städteregion Aachen (2009) ===
In 2004, a special-purpose association was formed including the city of Aachen, the district of Aachen, and the nine municipalities belonging to the district.  Its regular meetings consisted of 60 representatives of the association members with voting rights, and focused on expanding cooperation between the members, road traffic management, school administration, and economic development. This was a predecessor to the 2009 &quot;Städteregion&quot;.

In 2009, the North Rhine-Westphalia state parliament reorganized the district to include the city of Aachen, modeled after the district of Hanover. The existing Aachen district was dissolved and the new &quot;Städteregion Aachen&quot; took over tasks such as traffic planning and emergency services from the cities within it.

== Geography ==

Geographically the district covers a part of the Eifel mountains in the south, but also the lowlands of the Lower Rhine Bay.

== Coat of arms ==
The top of the coat of arms shows the black lion, the sign of Jülich, as the district contains mostly former parts of the duchy of Jülich. In the bottom the swan on a deer antler is the sign of the city of Burtscheid, which was the capital of the &quot;Landkreis Aachen&quot; until 1897, when it was incorporated into the city of Aachen.

<text>Baraka is a 1992 American non-narrative documentary film directed by Ron Fricke. The film is often compared to &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;, the first of the &quot;Qatsi&quot; films by Godfrey Reggio for which Fricke served as cinematographer. It was photographed in the 70 mm Todd-AO format, and is the first film ever to be restored and scanned at 8K resolution.

==Content==
&quot;Baraka&quot; is a documentary film with no narrative or voice-over. It explores themes via a compilation of natural events, life, human activities and technological phenomena shot in 24 countries on six continents over a 14-month period.

The film is named after the Islamic concept of baraka, meaning blessing, or Baruch in Hebrew, essence or breath.

The film is Ron Fricke&#x27;s follow-up to Godfrey Reggio&#x27;s similar non-verbal documentary film &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;. Fricke was cinematographer and collaborator on Reggio&#x27;s film, and for &quot;Baraka&quot; he struck out on his own to polish and expand the photographic techniques used on &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;. Shot in 70 mm, it includes a mixture of photographic styles including slow motion and time-lapse. Two camera systems were used to achieve this. A Todd-AO system was used to shoot conventional frame rates, but to execute the film&#x27;s time-lapse sequences Fricke had a special camera built that combined time-lapse photography with perfectly controlled movements.

Locations featured include the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the Ryōan temple in Kyoto, Lake Natron in Tanzania, burning oil fields in Kuwait, the smouldering precipice of an active volcano, a busy subway terminal, the aircraft boneyard of Davis–Monthan Air Force Base, tribal celebrations of the Maasai in Kenya, and chanting monks in the Dip Tse Chok Ling monastery.

The film features a number of long tracking shots through various settings, including Auschwitz and Tuol Sleng, over photos of the people involved, past skulls stacked in a room, to a spread of bones. It suggests a universal cultural perspective: a shot of an elaborate tattoo on a bathing Japanese yakuza precedes a view of tribal paint.

==Reissue==
Following previous DVD releases, in 2007 the original 65 mm negative was rescanned at 8K resolution with equipment designed specifically for &quot;Baraka&quot; at FotoKem Laboratories. The automated 8K film scanner, operating continuously, took more than three weeks to finish scanning more than 150,000 frames (taking approximately twelve to thirteen seconds to scan each frame), producing over thirty terabytes of image data in total.

After a 16-month digital intermediate process, including a 96 kHz/24-bit audio remaster by Stearns for the DTS-HD Master Audio , the result was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray in October 2008. At the time, project supervisor Andrew Oran described the reissue of &quot;Baraka&quot; as &quot;arguably the highest-quality DVD that&#x27;s ever been made&quot;. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert described the Blu-ray release as &quot;the finest video disc I have ever viewed or ever imagined.&quot;

==Sequel==
A sequel to &quot;Baraka&quot;, &quot;Samsara&quot;, also shot in 70 mm and made by the same filmmakers, premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and was released internationally in August 2012.

==Reception==
&quot;Baraka&quot; holds a score of 81% on Rotten Tomatoes out of twenty-six reviews. Roger Ebert included the film in his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list, writing: &quot;If man sends another &quot;Voyager&quot; to the distant stars and it can carry only one film on board, that film might be &quot;Baraka&quot;.&quot;

==Production==
===Music===

The score is by Michael Stearns and features music by, among others, Dead Can Dance, L. Subramaniam, Ciro Hurtado, Inkuyo, Brother, Anugama &amp; Sebastiano and David Hykes.

In 2019, German composer Mathias Rehfeldt released the concept album &quot;Baraka,&quot; inspired by the film.

<text>Viburnum lentago, the nannyberry, sheepberry, or sweet viburnum, is a species of &quot;Viburnum&quot; native to North America.

==Description==

It is a large shrub or small tree growing upwards to tall with a trunk up to in diameter and a short trunk, round-topped head, pendulous, flexible branches. The bark is reddish- to grayish-brown, and broken into small scales. The twigs are pale green and covered with rusty down at first, later becoming dark reddish brown, sometimes glaucous, smooth, tough, flexible, and produce an offensive odor when crushed or bruised. The winter buds are light red, covered with pale scurfy down, protected by a pair of opposing scales. Flower-bearing buds are long, obovate, long pointed; other terminal buds are acute, long, while lateral buds are much smaller. The bud scales enlarge with the growing shoot and often become leaf-like.

Like all viburnums, the leaves are arranged in opposite pairs on the twigs; they are oval, long and broad, wedge-shaped, rounded or subcordate at base, with an acuminate apex and a finely serrated margin, and a winged petiole. They open from the bud involute, bronze green and shining, hairy and downy; when full grown are bright green and shining above, pale green and marked with tiny black dots beneath. In autumn they turn a deep red, or red and orange.

The flowers are small, in diameter, with five whitish petals, arranged in large round terminal cymes in diameter; flowering is in late spring. The calyx is tubular, equally five-toothed, persistent; the corolla is equally five-lobed, imbricate in the bud, cream-white, one-quarter of an inch across; lobes acute, and slightly erose. There are five stamens, inserted on the base of the corolla, alternate with its lobes, exserted; filaments slender; anthers bright yellow, oblong, introrse, versatile, two-celled; cells opening longitudinally. The pistil has a one-celled inferior ovary, the style thick, short, light green, and the stigma broad; there is one ovule in each cell.

The fruit is a small round blue-black drupe, long on a reddish stem; it is thick-skinned, sweet, and rather juicy. The stone is oblong oval, flattened.

The roots are fibrous. The wood is ill-smelling, dark orange brown, heavy, hard, close-grained, with a specific gravity of 0.7303.

==Distribution and habitat==
Nannyberry is native to the northeastern and midwestern United States, and to southern Canada from New Brunswick west to southeastern Saskatchewan. Isolated populations are found in the Dakotas, Wyoming, Colorado, and the Appalachian Mountains as far south as Kentucky and Virginia. It grows in wet soil along the borders of the forest, often found in fence corners and along roadsides.

==Ecology==
Mammals, game birds and songbirds consume the fruit during the winter.

==Uses==
As suggested by the alternative name sweet viburnum, the fruit is (unlike that of many viburnums) widely palatable. The bark and leaves were also used by Native Americans in the preparation of herbal medicines.

It is admired for its compact habit, its lustrous foliage which insects rarely disfigure, its beautiful and abundant flowers, its handsome edible fruit and its brilliant autumnal color. It readily adapts itself to cultivation, and is one of the best of the small trees of eastern America for the decoration of parks and gardens in all regions of extreme winter cold. It is easily raised from seeds which, like those of the other American species, do not germinate until the second year after they are planted.

It has been hybridized with &quot;Viburnum prunifolium&quot; in gardens to give the hybrid &quot;Viburnum × jackii&quot;.

The district consists of nine municipalities, all entitled &quot;Stadt&quot; (town or city).

=== Adjacent cities and districts ===
The Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the district-free cities of Bochum, Dortmund and Hagen, the districts of Märkischer Kreis (with Schalksmühle and Halver) and Oberbergischer Kreis (with Radevormwald), the city of Wuppertal, the district of Mettmann (with Velbert) and the city of Essen.

==History==

The district was created in 1929 by merging the former district of Schwelm with parts of the former districts of Hattingen and Hagen. In 1970 and 1975 it was modified a bit during the reorganization of the districts in North Rhine-Westphalia; most notable was the inclusion of the previously independent city of Witten in 1975.

==Politics==

Since 2015, the district administrator of the Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis has been Olaf Schade of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). In the most recent election on 13 September 2020, Schade was re-elected with the support of the SPD and The Greens, winning 61.6% of votes against Oliver Flüshöh, who was nominated by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Free Democratic Party (FDP).

===District council===

The Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis council governs the district alongside the administrator. The most recent district council election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:

===State Landtag===
In the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia, the Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis is divided between three constituencies: 104 Hagen II – Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis III (containing Breckerfeld, Ennepetal, and Gevelsberg), 105 Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis I (Hattingen, Schwelm, Sprockhövel, and Wetter), and 106 Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis II (Herdecke and Witten). In the 2017–22 parliamentary term, all three constituencies were held by the SPD. Hagen II – Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis III was represented by Falk Heinrichs, Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis I by Rainer Bovermann, and Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis II by Nadja Büteführ.

===Federal parliament===
In the Bundestag, the Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis is divided between two constituencies: 138 Hagen – Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis I (Breckerfeld, Gevelsberg, Schwelm, and Ennepetal) and 139 Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis II (Hattingen, Herdecke, Sprockhövel, Wetter, and Witten). In the 20th Bundestag, both are held by the SPD. Hagen – Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis I is represented by Timo Schisanowski, and Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis II by Axel Echeverria.

==Coat of arms==
In the middle of the coat of arms there is the checked red-white bar of the County of Mark, which owned the area in medieval times. The two wavy lines above and below depict the two rivers which gave the district its name, the Ruhr and the Ennepe.

<doc id="183628" wikidata="Q982" url="?curid=183628" title="FIS Alpine Ski World Cup">
<text>The FIS Alpine Ski World Cup is the top international circuit of alpine skiing competitions, launched in 1966 by a group of ski racing friends and experts which included French journalist Serge Lang and the alpine ski team directors from France (Honore Bonnet) and the USA (Bob Beattie). It was soon backed by International Ski Federation president Marc Hodler during the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1966 at Portillo, Chile, and became an official FIS event in the spring of 1967 after the FIS Congress at Beirut, Lebanon.

The inaugural World Cup race was held on 5 January 1967 in Berchtesgaden, West Germany, a slalom won by Heinrich Messner of Austria. Jean-Claude Killy of France and Nancy Greene of Canada were the overall winners for the first two seasons.

==Rules==
Competitors attempt to achieve the best time in four disciplines: slalom, giant slalom, super G, and downhill. The fifth event, the combined, employs the downhill and slalom. The World Cup originally included only slalom, giant slalom, and downhill races. Combined events (calculated using results from selected downhill and slalom races) were included starting with the 1974–75 season, while the Super G was added for the 1982–83 season.

The current scoring system was implemented in the 1991–92 season. For every race points are awarded to the top 30 finishers: 100 points to the winner, 80 for second, 60 for third, winding down to 1 point for 30th place. The racer with the most points at the end of the season in mid-March wins the cup, represented by a 9 kilogram crystal globe. Sub-prizes are also awarded in each individual race discipline, with a smaller 3.5 kg crystal globe.

Since 1967, the big crystal globe has been awarded for the overall title. From the beginning to 1971–72, discipline titles were awarded with medals. Statistically, those titles have the same value as the small crystal globes, which first appeared for discipline titles in slalom, giant slalom and downhill in the 1977–78. In super-G, the small globe has been awarded since 1985–86. For super-g races in the three seasons previous, points were added and calculated in the giant slalom ranking. 

The World Cup is held annually, and is considered the premier competition for alpine ski racing after the quadrennial Winter Olympics. Many consider the World Cup to be a more valuable title than the Olympics or the biennial World Championships, since it requires a competitor to ski at an extremely high level in several disciplines throughout the season, and not just in one race.

Races are hosted primarily at ski resorts in the Alps in Europe, with regular stops in Scandinavia, North America, and east Asia, but a few races have also been held in the Southern Hemisphere. World Cup competitions have been hosted in 25 countries around the world: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.

Lower competitive circuits include the NorAm Cup in North America and the Europa Cup in Europe.

=== Parallel giant slalom ===

Introduced by the International Ski Federation to the World Cup as a spectator-friendly event in late 2015, the parallel giant slalom competition, or shortened parallel-G, joining the parallel slalom, is intended to lure more speed specialists into the faster of the two technical disciplines, along with attracting their fans to watch the races at the venue, on-line, and on television. Few venues offer the slope and conditions required to host an extremely short Giant slalom course that can be readily viewed in its entirety by a compact gallery of fans. Modified or not, the Federation has not suggested that they will push the format to lower-level tours like the NorAm and Europa Cup.

==== Format ====
The Chief Race Director of the inaugural event at Alta Badia, Markus Waldner, on 20 December 2015 stated that &quot;great performances&quot; and &quot;head-to-head fights&quot; between the best giant slalom racers is the goal of the competition. The course for the first race was very compact at about 20–22 seconds duration, or about one-third of a normal GS run. The pace and cadence was the same as Giant slalom, not standard Slalom. Gates were set at roughly the same distances as GS and on a slope of about the same pitch. The field of thirty-two were drawn following an invitational format. The top four men in the overall World Cup rankings were automatic invitees, if they chose to compete. Another 16 racers were selected from the top of the current GS start list rankings, and the final twelve competitors were selected from the 1st run efforts at the standard GS event the day prior at the same venue. Overlapping qualifications allowed the sponsors to invite lower ranked participants to fill in gaps, as needed, and to replace individuals who declined to participate. Points were awarded and accumulated according to current standards for the race season in all relevant categories: the GS discipline, Overall and Nations Cup. The field was filled with thirty-two first round participants, each getting a run on either course. The best combined times moved the fastest racer to the second round through bracket preference protocols. From the second round, skiers the head-to-head competitions were held over one run only, with the faster skier from the previous round granted course selection between the &#x27;red-right&#x27; or &#x27;blue-left&#x27; course. At about one-third the time of a standard GS event, top performers/finalists were able to make multiple runs without the fatigue of a longer event. The course was methodically set with lasers, and a GPS-equipped Snowcat, to guarantee that both courses on the hill were as identical as possible to ensure equity and a fair competition. The Race Director suggested the difference between the two lanes were within &quot;1–to–2 centimeters&quot; tolerance of one another.

== Scoring system ==

The World Cup scoring system is based on awarding a number of points for each place in a race, but the procedure for doing so and the often-arcane method used to calculate the annual champions has varied greatly over the years. Originally, points were awarded only to the top ten finishers in each race, with 25 points for the winner, 20 for second, 15 for third, 11 for fourth, 8 for fifth, 6 for sixth, 4 for seventh, then decreasing by one point for each lower place. To determine the winner for each discipline World Cup, only a racer&#x27;s best three results counted, from a typical six to eight races in each discipline (consistent with the then-current classification of skiers as amateurs, who couldn&#x27;t be expected compete all the time). For the overall Cup, only these best three results in each discipline were included. Until 1970, the results of Winter Olympic Games races and Alpine World Ski Championship races were also included in the World Cup points valuation (&quot;i&quot;.&quot;e&quot;., Grenoble 1968 and Val Gardena 1970); this was abandoned after 1970, mainly due to the limited number of racers per nation who are permitted to take part in these events. Beginning with the 1971–72 season (the sixth season), the number of results counted was increased to five in each discipline. The formula used to determine the overall winner varied almost every year over the next decade, with some seasons divided into two portions with a fixed number of results in each period counting toward the overall, while in other seasons the best three or four results in each discipline would count.

Starting with the 1979–80 season (the 14th season), points were awarded to the top 15 finishers in each race. After 1980–81, the formula for the overall title stabilized for several years, counting the best 5 results in the original disciplines (slalom, giant slalom, and downhill) plus the best three results in combined. When Super G events were introduced for the 1982–83 season, the results were included with giant slalom for the first three seasons, before a separate Cup for the discipline was awarded starting in 1985–86 and the top 3 Super G results were counted toward the overall. The formula for the overall was changed yet again the following season, with the top four results in each discipline counting, along with all combined results (although the combined was nearly eliminated from the schedule, reduced to one or two events per season).

This perennial tweaking of the scoring formula was a source of ongoing uncertainty to the World Cup racers and to fans. The need for a complete overhaul of the scoring system had grown increasingly urgent with each successive year, especially once the FIS and the International Olympic Committee accepted after 1984 that the skiers were fully professional and not amateurs, so they no longer needed an artificial limitation on their number of events. 

In 1987–88 (the 22nd season), the FIS decided to simplify the system: all results would now count in each discipline and in the overall. This new system was an immediate success, and the practice of counting all results has been maintained in every subsequent season. 

With the ongoing expansion of the number and quality of competitors in World Cup races over the years, another major change to the scoring system was implemented in the 1991–92 season (the 26th season). Instead of only the top 15 skiers scoring points, with 25 points awarded for winning, 20 for second, and 15 for third (as had been done every season after the end of 1978-79), the top 30 finishers in each race would now earn points, with 100 for the winner, 80 for second, 60 for third, and then decreasing by smaller increments for each lower place. The point values were adjusted slightly the following season (to adjust and reduce the points for places 4th through 20th), and the scoring system has not been changed again since that year. 

The table below compares the point values under all five scoring systems which have been in use:


=== Statistical analysis ===
Since the Top 30 scoring system was implemented in 1991–92., the number of completed men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s World Cup races each year has ranged from 30 to 44, so the maximum possible point total for an individual racer is about 3000–4400 under the current scoring system. Very few racers actually ski in all events. Bode Miller is the only skier who competed in every World Cup race during the three seasons from 2003 to 2005. The current record for total World Cup points in a season is Tina Maze&#x27;s 2414 points in 2012–13, with the men&#x27;s record of 2042 points set by Marco Odermatt in 2022–2023. The fewest points for an overall champion under the current system thus far have been 1009 for men by Aksel Lund Svindal in 2008–09 and 1248 for women by Vreni Schneider in 1994–95. The largest margin of victory in the overall has been Maze&#x27;s 1313 points in 2012–13, more than doubling second-place finisher Maria Höfl-Riesch&#x27;s total, while the largest men&#x27;s margin was 743 points by Hermann Maier in 2000–01. Note that in the early days of World Cup (when the first place was awarded only 25 points), even larger relative margins of victory were recorded in 1967 by Jean-Claude Killy with 225 points over Heinrich Messner with 114 points and in 1973–74 by Annemarie Moser-Pröll with 268 points over Monika Kaserer with 153 points. The closest finishes since 1992 have been minuscule margins of 6 points in 1994–95 (Vreni Schneider over Katja Seizinger), 3 points in 2004–05 (Anja Pärson over Janica Kostelić) and in 2010–11 (Maria Riesch over Lindsey Vonn), and only 2 points in 2008–09 (Aksel Lund Svindal over Benjamin Raich). The current men&#x27;s record for total World Cup points in one month of the season is Ivica Kostelić&#x27;s 999 points from January 2011.

The tables below contain a brief statistical analysis of the overall World Cup standings during the 21 seasons since the Top 30 scoring system was implemented in 1991–92. In general, over 1000 points are needed to contend for the overall title. At least 1 man and 1 woman has scored 1000 points in each of these seasons, but no more than 5 men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s racers have crossed that threshold in any single season. Of the 42 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s overall champions in these years, 38 scored over 1200 points, 30 had over 1300 points, 19 reached 1500 points, and only 7 amassed more than 1700 points during their winning seasons. As for the runners-up, 37 of the 42 second-place finishers scored over 1000 points, 18 had over 1300 points, and only 4 reached 1500 points yet failed to win. Most overall titles have been won quite convincingly, by more than 200 points in 23 of 42 cases, while only 11 margins of victory have been tighter than 50 points.

== Finals ==
Since 1993 the International Ski Federation (FIS) has hosted a World Cup Final at the end of each season in March. During five days, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s races are held in four disciplines: slalom, giant slalom, Super G, and downhill, as well as a team event. Only a limited number of racers are invited to ski at the Finals, including the top 25 in the World Cup standings in each discipline, the current junior World Champions in each discipline, and any skiers with at least 500 points in the general classification. Because of the smaller field, World Cup points are only awarded to the top 15 finishers in each race.

From inception, the finals took place during one week, with the speed events held during the week and the technical events during the weekend. However, beginning in 2024, the schedule was changed so that the finals took up two weekends, with the technical events during the first weekend and the speed events during the second.

===Hosts===
== Winners by country ==
The table below lists those nations which have won at least one World Cup race (current as of 23 February 2025). 

=== Men ===

=== Women ===

=== Alpine team event ===
&quot;Individual race wins are counted in this table, along with the nations team events held at World Cup Finals since 2006 (counts double as men and women in mixed competition contribute to a win). The &quot;parallel race&quot; is a head-to-head slalom race format used occasionally from the 1970s through 1990s, and again in 2011. Team event wins are doubled (because on one team event race competed both women and men; so it&#x27;s counted separately each for women and men). Results for West Germany and Germany are counted together in this table. All of Yugoslavia&#x27;s wins are currently lumped in with Slovenia, since the skiers who won races for former Yugoslavia were all Slovenes from Slovenia (one of six Yugoslav Republics), and thus are listed under Slovenia in online databases. The Soviet Union and Russia are counted separately, as are Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic.&quot;

A total of 24 countries have won World Cup races, with 19 countries winning men&#x27;s races and 20 winning women&#x27;s races. As expected, the top ten nations in this list are the ten nations listed in the Nations Cup summary table (with slight changes in order).

Marc Girardelli accounted for all of Luxembourg&#x27;s 46 wins, while Janica Kostelić has 30 of Croatia&#x27;s 56 and her brother Ivica has the rest. Ingemar Stenmark still has nearly one-half of Sweden&#x27;s 192 wins more than two decades after his retirement. Some nations specialize in either speed (downhill and Super G) or technical (slalom and GS) disciplines, while others are strong across the board. Among nations with 30+ wins, the Canadian team has won 73% of its races in speed events, while Yugoslavia/Slovenia has won 84% and Sweden 86% of their races in technical events, especially notable in Sweden&#x27;s case given its large number of wins. Several nations with under 30 wins have 100% of them in technical events, led by Finland and Spain. In contrast Germany and Norway have the most even distribution without disproportionate strength or weakness in any one discipline. Some nations have strong teams in only one gender, as 92% of Norway&#x27;s wins have come from their men and 83% of Germany&#x27;s from their women, while the Swiss, French and Canadian totals are split almost equally.

==Nations Cup==
The Nations Cup standings are calculated by adding up all points each season for all racers from a given nation.

<text>Nyssa sylvatica, commonly known as tupelo, black tupelo, black gum or sour gum, is a medium-sized deciduous tree native to eastern North America from the coastal Northeastern United States and southern Ontario south to central Florida and eastern Texas, as well as Mexico.

==Names==
&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot; genus name, &quot;Nyssa&quot;, refers to a Greek water nymph; the species epithet &quot;sylvatica&quot; refers to its woodland habitat.

The species&#x27; common name, tupelo, is of Native American origin, coming from the Creek words &quot;ito&quot; &quot;tree&quot; and &quot;opilwa&quot; &quot;swamp&quot;; it was in use by the mid-18th century.

While these trees are often known as simply &quot;tupelo&quot;, the fuller name, black tupelo, helps distinguish it from the other species of the tupelo genus &quot;Nyssa&quot;, some of which have overlapping ranges, such as water tupelo (&quot;N. aquatica&quot;) and swamp tupelo (&quot;N. biflora&quot;). The name &quot;tupelo&quot; is used primarily in the American South; northward and in Appalachia, the tree is more commonly called the black gum or the sour gum, although no part of the plant is particularly gummy. Both of these names contrast it with a different tree species with a broadly overlapping range, the sweet gum (&quot;Liquidambar styraciflua&quot;), which does produce an aromatic resin. Another common name used occasionally in the Northeast is pepperidge.

In Appalachia, the frequent variant is &quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot; var. &quot;caroliniana&quot;, which is sometimes called the Yellow Gum. Its leaflets are thinner and less glossy, &quot;with rather long tips, the under surface persistently somewhat downy and covered with minute warty excrescences easily seen under an ordinary hand lens&quot; &quot;Yellow Gum is not a swamp tree, like Black Gum, but an inhabitant of dry land, hills, and the coves of the southern Appalachians which it ascends to 3500 feet.

On Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, in Massachusetts, this species is called &quot;beetlebung&quot;, perhaps for its use in making the mallet known as a beetle, used for hammering bungs (stoppers) into barrels.

==Description==

&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot; grows to tall, rarely to , with a trunk diameter of , rarely up to . These trees typically have a straight trunk with the branches extending outward at right angles. The bark is dark gray and flaky when young, but it becomes furrowed with age, resembling alligator hide on very old stems. The twigs of this tree are reddish-brown, usually hidden by a greyish skin. The pith is chambered with greenish partitions.

The leaves vary in size and shape. They can be oval, elliptical, or obovate, and long. They have lustrous upper surfaces, with entire, often wavy margins. The foliage turns purple in autumn, eventually becoming an intense bright scarlet. Deer are extremely fond of the leaves on seedlings and saplings, to the point where large populations of them can make establishment of the tree almost impossible. For comparison, mature trees are largely left alone.

The flowers are very small, in greenish-white in clusters at the top of a long stalk and a rich source of nectar for bees. They are often dioecious so a male and female tree in proximity is required to set seed, however, many trees are also polygamo-dioecious, which means they have both male and female flowers on the same tree. The fruit is a black-blue, ovoid stone fruit, about 10 mm long with a thin, oily, bitter-to-sour tasting flesh and very popular with small bird species. There are from one to three fruits together on a long slender stalk. They are a valuable energy food for birds, especially the American robin.

&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot; forms a large deep taproot when young that makes transplanting difficult. Because of this, it is fairly uncommon in cultivation and the nursery trade.

Additional characteristics include:
* Bark: Light reddish brown, deeply furrowed and scaly. Branchlets at first pale green to orange, sometimes smooth, often downy, later dark brown.
* Wood: Pale yellow, sapwood white; heavy, strong, very tough, hard to split, not durable in contact with the soil. Used for turnery. Sp. gr., 0.6353; weight of cu. ft., 39.59.
* Winter buds: Dark red, obtuse, one-fourth of an inch long. Inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot, becoming red before they fall.
* Leaves: Alternate, often crowded at the end of the lateral branches, simple, linear, oblong to oval, two to five inches (127 mm) long, one-half to three inches (76 mm) broad, wedge-shaped or rounded at base, entire, with margin slightly thickened, acute or acuminate. They come out of the bud conduplicate, coated beneath with rusty tomentum, when full grown are thick, dark green, very shining above, pale and often hairy beneath. Feather-veined, midrib and primary veins prominent beneath. In autumn they turn bright scarlet, or yellow and scarlet. Petioles one-quarter to one-half an inch long, slender or stout, terete or margined, often red.
* Flowers: May, June, when leaves are half grown. Polygamodiœcious, yellowish green, borne on slender downy peduncles. Staminate in many-flowered heads; pistillate in two to several flowered clusters.
* Calyx: Cup-shaped, five-toothed.
* Corolla: Petals five, imbricate in bud, yellow green, ovate, thick, slightly spreading, inserted on the margin of the conspicuous disk.
* Stamens: Five to twelve. In staminate flowers exserted, in pistillate short, often wanting.
* Pistil: Ovary inferior, one to two-celled; style stout, exserted, reflexed above the middle. Entirely wanting in sterile flower. Ovules, one in each cell.
* Fruit: Fleshy drupe, one to three from each flower cluster. Ovoid, two-thirds of an inch long, dark blue, acid. Stone more or less ridged. October.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot; grows in various uplands and in alluvial stream bottoms from southwestern Maine and New York, to extreme southern Ontario, central Michigan, Illinois, and central Missouri, south to southern Florida, eastern Texas, and eastern Oklahoma. Optimum development is made on lower slopes and terraces in the Southeastern United States. It also occurs locally in the mountains of eastern and southern Mexico, where it is found in the southern Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre de Oaxaca of Hidalgo, Puebla, and Veracruz states and the Chiapas Highlands of Chiapas.

&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot; is found in a wide range of climates, including upland and wetland habitats, in its extensive range. It commonly grows in both the creek bottoms of the southern coastal plains, to altitudes of about in the Southern Appalachians. These trees grow best on well-drained, light-textured soils on the low ridges of second bottoms and on the high flats of silty alluvium. In the uplands it grows best on the loams and clay loams of lower slopes and coves.

The species occurs in 35 different forest cover types. When found on drier upper slopes and ridges, it is seldom of log size or quality.

In Mexico it is a common species in montane cloud forests, particularly in moist or riparian habitats, between in elevation.

==Ecology==
The flowers are an important source of nectar and its fruits are important to many birds and mammals. Hollow trunks provide nesting or denning opportunities for bees and various mammals. It is among the longest living non-clonal flowering plants in eastern North America, capable of obtaining ages of over 650 years.

===Wildlife===

&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot; is an important food source for many migrating birds in the fall [autumn]. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson&#x27;s thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, hermit thrush, wood thrush, northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, northern flicker, pileated woodpecker, eastern phoebe, brown thrasher, eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar waxwing, and American crow, all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree&#x27;s range.

The limbs of these trees often deteriorate early, and the decayed holes make excellent dens for squirrels, raccoons, Virginia opossums, as well as nesting sites for feral honeybees.

The leaves are mined by larvae of the tupelo leafminer moth and eaten by forest tent caterpillars.

==Uses==
===Cultivation===
&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, where it is often used as a specimen or shade tree. The tree is best when grown in sheltered but not crowded positions, developing a pyramidal shape in youth, and spreading with age. The stem rises to the summit of the tree in one tapering unbroken shaft, the branches come out at right angles to the trunk and either extend horizontally or droop a little, making a long-narrow, cone-like head.

The leaves are short-petioled and so have little individual motion, but the branches sway as a whole. The spray is fine and abundant and lies horizontally so that the foliage arrangement is not unlike that of the beech &quot;(Fagus)&quot;. Its often spectacular autumnal coloring, with intense reds to purples, is highly valued in landscape settings. It is claimed to be the most fiery and brilliant of the &#x27;brilliant group&#x27; that includes maple, dogwood, sassafras, and sweet gum, as well as various species of tupelo.

In the UK the cultivar &#x27;Wisley Bonfire&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Honey production===
&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot; is a major source of wild honey in many areas within its range. Hollow sections of black gum trunks were formerly used as bee gums by beekeepers.

===Wood===
The wood of &quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot; is heavy, hard, cross-grained, and difficult to split, especially after drying. This resistance to splitting led to its use for making mauls, pulleys, wheel hubs, agricultural rollers, bowls, and paving blocks. The wood is also used for pallets, rough floors, pulpwood, and firewood. Since the wood is very tough and resistant to wear, it has been used for shuttles in weaving. Because it is resistant to wear and very readily accepts creosote-based preservatives it is considered to be a premier wood for making railroad ties. The wood&#x27;s resistance to wear and some acids has led to its use as factory flooring.

===Teeth-cleaning twig===
It was also used traditionally by Native Americans as a teeth-cleaning twig. It also was used for dipping snuff.

<doc id="183635" wikidata="Q157324" url="?curid=183635" title="François Guizot">
<text>François Pierre Guillaume Guizot (; 4 October 1787 – 12 September 1874) was a French historian, orator and statesman. Guizot was a dominant figure in French politics between the Revolution of 1830 and the Revolution of 1848.

A conservative liberal who opposed the attempt by King Charles X to usurp legislative power, he worked to sustain a constitutional monarchy following the July Revolution of 1830. He then served the &quot;citizen king&quot; Louis Philippe, as Minister of Education 1832–37, ambassador to London 1840, Foreign Minister 1840–1847, and finally Prime Minister of France from 19 September 1847 to 23 February 1848.

Guizot&#x27;s influence was critical in expanding public education, which under his ministry saw the creation of primary schools in every French commune. As a leader of the &quot;Doctrinaires&quot;, committed to supporting the policies of Louis Phillipe and limitations on further expansion of the political franchise, he earned the hatred of more left-leaning liberals and republicans through his unswerving support for restricting suffrage to propertied men and supposedly advised those who wanted the vote to &quot;enrich yourselves&quot; (enrichissez-vous) through hard work and thrift.

As Prime Minister, it was Guizot&#x27;s ban on the political meetings (called the campagne des banquets or the Paris Banquets, which were held by moderate liberals who wanted a larger extension of the franchise) of an increasingly vigorous opposition in January 1848 that catalyzed the revolution that toppled Louis Philippe in February and saw the establishment of the French Second Republic. He is mentioned in the famous opening paragraph of the Communist Manifesto (&quot;a spectre is haunting Europe...&quot;) as a representative of the more liberal faction of the counter-revolutionary forces of Old Europe, contrasted with that of the more reactionary forces, Klemens von Metternich. Marx and Engels published that book just days before Guizot&#x27;s overthrow in the 1848 Revolution.

==Early years==

Guizot was born at Nîmes to a bourgeois Protestant family. 

On 8 April 1794, when François Guizot was 6, his father was executed on the scaffold at Nîmes during the Reign of Terror. From then on, the boy&#x27;s mother was completely responsible for his upbringing.

Driven from Nîmes by the Revolution, Madame Guizot and her son went to Geneva, where he was educated. In spite of her decided Calvinistic opinions, the theories of Jean-Jacques Rousseau influenced Madame Guizot. A strong Liberal, she even adopted the notion inculcated in &quot;&quot; that every man ought to learn a manual trade or craft. Guizot learnt carpentry, and succeeded in making a table with his own hands, which is still preserved. 

In 1805, he arrived in Paris and he entered at the age eighteen as tutor into the family of M. Stapfer, formerly Swiss minister in France. He soon began to write in a journal edited by Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard, the &quot;Publiciste&quot;. This connection introduced him to the literary society of Paris.

In October 1809, aged twenty-two, he wrote a series review of François-René de Chateaubriand&#x27;s &quot;Martyrs&quot;, which won Chateaubriand&#x27;s approbation and thanks, and he continued to contribute largely to the periodical press. At Suard&#x27;s he had made the acquaintance of Pauline de Meulan (born 2 November 1773), a contributor to Suard&#x27;s journal. 

Her contributions were interrupted by illness, but immediately resumed and continued by an unknown hand. It was discovered that François Guizot had substituted for her. In 1812 Mademoiselle de Meulan married Guizot. She died in 1827. (An only son, François, born in 1819, died in 1837 of consumption.) In 1828 Guizot married Elisa Dillon, niece of his first wife, and also an author. She died in 1833, leaving two daughters, Henriette (1829–1908), a co-author with her father and prolific writer herself, and Pauline (1831–1874) and a son, Guillaume (1833–1892), who attained some reputation as a scholar and writer. François Guizot and historian François Mignet invented the concept of the &quot;bourgeois revolution&quot;.

On 15 June 1837, Guizot sat next to the Princess Lieven at a dinner given by the Duc de Broglie. After twenty years as Russian Ambassadress to London, she had separated from her husband and sought refuge in Paris, where from 1835 she had held an increasingly influential salon occasionally attended by Guizot. She had sympathised with him over his son&#x27;s death earlier in 1837. From 15 June, they formed a close and loving friendship, exchanging over 5000 letters. He was present at her death in Paris in 1856. Her role in supporting and influencing his aims in aristocratic, political and diplomatic circles was considerable, aided by her retaining many contacts in England and her brother being Chief of Secret Police in Russia and a confidant of the Tsar.

During the First French Empire, Guizot, entirely devoted to literary pursuits, published a collection of French synonyms (1809), an essay on the fine arts (1811), and a translation of Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, with additional notes, in 1812. These works recommended him to the notice of Louis-Marcelin de Fontanes, grand-master of the University of France, who selected Guizot for the chair of modern history at the Sorbonne in 1812. 

He delivered his first lecture (reprinted in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;) on 11 December of that year. He omitted the customary compliment to the all-powerful emperor, in spite of the hints given him by his patron, but the course which followed marks the beginning of the great revival of historical research in France in the 19th century. He had now acquired a considerable position in Paris society, and the friendship of Royer-Collard and leading members of the liberal party, including the young duc de Broglie. 

Absent from Paris at the moment of the fall of Napoleon in 1814, he was at once selected, on the recommendation of Royer-Collard, to serve the government of King Louis XVIII, in the capacity of secretary-general of the ministry of the interior, under the abbé de Montesquiou. Upon the return of Napoleon from Elba he immediately resigned, on 25 March 1815, and returned to his literary pursuits.

==&quot;The Man of Ghent&quot;==

After the Hundred Days, he returned to Ghent, where he saw Louis XVIII, and in the name of the liberal party pointed out that a frank adoption of a liberal policy could alone secure the duration of the restored monarchy – advice which was ill-received by the king&#x27;s confidential advisers. 

This visit to Ghent was brought up by political opponents in later years as unpatriotic. &quot;The Man of Ghent&quot; was one of the terms of insult frequently used against him in the days of his power. The reproach appears to be wholly unfounded. He was acting not to preserve the failing empire, but to establish a liberal monarchy and to combat the reactionary ultra-royalists.

On the second restoration, Guizot was appointed secretary-general of the ministry of justice under de Barbé-Marbois, but resigned with his chief in 1816. In 1819 he was one of the founders of the Liberal journal &quot;Le Courrier français&quot;. Again in 1819 he was appointed general director of communes and departments in the ministry of the interior, but lost his office with the fall of Decazes in February 1820. 

During these years Guizot was one of the leaders of the Doctrinaires, a small party strongly attached to the charter and the crown, and advocating a policy which has become associated (especially by Émile Faguet) with the name of Guizot, that of the &quot;juste milieu&quot;, a middle path between absolutism and popular government. 

Adhering to the great principles of liberty and toleration, they were sternly opposed to the anarchical traditions of the Revolution. They hoped to subdue the elements of anarchy through the power of a limited constitution based on the suffrage of the middle class and promoted by the literary talents of the time. They were opposed alike to the democratic spirit of the age, to the military traditions of the empire, and to the bigotry and absolutism of the court. The Doctrinaires fell out of influence following the July Revolution in 1830.

In 1820, when the reaction was at its height after the murder of the Duc de Berry, and the fall of the ministry of the duc Decazes, Guizot was deprived of his offices, and in 1822 even his course of lectures were interdicted. 

During the succeeding years he played an important part among the leaders of the liberal opposition to the government of Charles X, although he had not yet entered parliament, and this was also the time of his greatest literary activity. 

In 1822, he published his lectures on representative government (&quot;Histoire des origines du gouvernement représentatif, 1821–1822&quot;, 2 vols.; Eng. trans. 1852); also a work on capital punishment for political offences and several important political pamphlets. From 1822 to 1830 he published two important collections of historical sources, the memoirs of the history of England in 26 volumes, and the memoirs of the history of France in 31 volumes, a revised translation, of Shakespeare, and a volume of essays on the history of France. Written from his own pen during this period was the first part of his &quot;Histoire de la révolution d&#x27;Angleterre depuis Charles I à Charles II&quot; (2 vols., 1826–1827; Eng. trans., 2 vols., Oxford, 1838), which he resumed and completed during his exile in England after 1848. 

The Martignac administration restored Guizot in 1828 to his professor&#x27;s chair and to the council of state. During his time at the University of Paris his lectures earned him a reputation as a historian of note. These lectures formed the basis of his general &quot;Histoire de la civilisation en Europe&quot; (1828; Eng. trans. by William Hazlitt, 3 vols., 1846), and of his &quot;Histoire de la civilisation en France&quot; (4 vols., 1830).

In January 1830 he was elected by the town of Lisieux to the Chamber of Deputies, and he retained that seat during the whole of his political life. Guizot delivered an address in March 1830 calling for greater political freedom in the Chamber of Deputies. The motion passed 221 against 181. Charles X responded by dissolving the Chamber and called for new elections which only strengthened opposition to the throne. 

On his return to Paris from Nîmes on 27 July, the fall of Charles X was already imminent. Guizot was called upon by his friends Casimir Perier, Jacques Laffitte, Villemain and Dupin to draw up the protest of the liberal deputies against the royal ordinances of July, while he applied himself with them to control the revolutionary character of the late contest. Personally, Guizot was always of opinion that it was a great misfortune for the cause of parliamentary government in France that the infatuation and ineptitude of Charles X and Prince Polignac rendered a change in the hereditary line of succession inevitable. 

Once convinced that it was inevitable, he became one of the most ardent supporters of Louis Philippe. In August 1830 Guizot was made minister of the interior, but resigned in November. He had now joined the ranks of the moderate liberals, and for the next eighteen years was a determined foe of democracy, the unyielding champion of &quot;a monarchy limited by a limited number of bourgeois.&quot;

==Minister of King Louis Philippe==

In 1831 Casimir Périer formed a more vigorous and compact administration, terminated in May 1832 by his death; the summer of that year was marked by a formidable republican rising in Paris, and it was not until 11 October 1832 that a stable government was formed, in which Marshal Soult was first minister, Victor, 3rd duc de Broglie took the foreign office, Adolphe Thiers the home department, and Guizot the department of public instruction. 

Guizot, however, was already unpopular with the more advanced liberal party. He remained unpopular all his life. Yet never were his great abilities more useful to his country than while he filled this office of secondary rank but of primary importance in the department of public instruction. The duties it imposed on him were entirely congenial to his literary tastes, and he was master of the subjects they concerned. He applied himself in the first instance to carry the law of 28 June 1833, which established and organized primary education in France.

The branch of the Institute of France known as the , which had been suppressed by Napoleon, was revived by Guizot. Some of the old members of this learned body – Talleyrand, Sieyès, Roederer and Lakanal – again took their seats there, and a host of more recent celebrities were added by election for the free discussion of the great problems of political and social science. The Société de l&#x27;histoire de France was founded for the publication of historical works, and a vast publication of medieval chronicles and diplomatic papers was undertaken at the expense of the state.

The July Monarchy was threatened in 1839 by Louis-Mathieu Molé, who had formed an intermediate government. Guizot and the leaders of the left centre and the left, Thiers and Odilon Barrot worked together to stop Molé. Victory was secured at the expense of principle, and Guizot&#x27;s attack on the government gave rise to a crisis and a republican insurrection. None of the three leaders of that alliance took ministerial office, and Guizot was not sorry to accept the post of ambassador in London, which withdrew him for a time from parliamentary contests. This was in the spring of 1840, and Thiers succeeded shortly afterwards to the ministry of foreign affairs.

Guizot was received with distinction by Queen Victoria and by London society. His literary works were highly esteemed, and he was sincerely attached to the alliance of the two nations and the cause of peace. He also secured the return of Napoleon&#x27;s ashes to France at the insistence of Thiers. 

As he himself remarked, he was a stranger to England and a novice in diplomacy; the embroiled state of the Syrian War question, on which the French government had separated itself from the joint policy of Europe, and possibly the absence of entire confidence between the ambassador and the minister of foreign affairs, placed him in an embarrassing and even false position. The warnings he transmitted to Thiers were not believed. The treaty of 15 July was signed without his knowledge and executed against his advice. For some weeks Europe seemed to be on the brink of war, until the king ended the crisis by refusing his assent to the military preparations of Thiers, and by summoning Guizot from London to form a ministry and to aid his Majesty in what he termed &quot;&quot;ma lutte tenace contre l&#x27;anarchie&quot;.&quot;

==The second Soult government==


Thus began, under dark and adverse circumstances, on 29 October 1840, the important administration in which Guizot remained the master-spirit for nearly eight years. He himself took the office of minister for foreign affairs, and upon the retirement of Marshal Soult, he became prime minister. His first care was the maintenance of peace and the restoration of amicable relations with the other powers of Europe. His success gave unity and strength to the moderate liberal party, who now felt that they had a great leader at their head.

During Guizot&#x27;s tenure as foreign minister, he and Lord Aberdeen, the foreign secretary to Sir Robert Peel, carried on well, and thus they secured France and Britain in the entente cordiale. Part of the formation of the entente came about when Guizot secured the transfer of Napoleon&#x27;s ashes from St. Helena to the French government. 

The opposition in France denounced Guizot&#x27;s foreign policy as basely subservient to England. He replied in terms of unmeasured contempt: &quot;You may raise the pile of calumny as high as you will; you will never reach the height of my disdain! (&quot;Vous n&#x27;arriverez jamais a la hauteur de mon dédain!&quot;&quot;) In 1845 British and French troops fought side by side for the first time in the Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata.

The fall of Peel&#x27;s government in 1846 changed these intimate relations; and the return of Palmerston to the foreign office led Guizot to believe that he was again exposed to the passionate rivalry of the British cabinet. A friendly understanding had been established between the two courts with reference to the future marriage of the young queen of Spain. The language of Lord Palmerston and the conduct of Sir Henry Bulwer (afterwards Lord Dalling) at Madrid led Guizot to believe that this understanding was broken, provoking the Affair of the Spanish Marriages after Guizot came to believe that Britain intended to place a Coburg on the throne of Spain. 

Determined to resist any such intrigue, Guizot and the king plunged headlong into a counter-intrigue, wholly inconsistent with their previous engagements to Britain and fatal to the happiness of the queen of Spain. By their influence she was urged into a marriage with a despicable offset of the house of Bourbon, and her sister was at the same time married to the youngest son of the French king, in direct violation of Louis Philippe&#x27;s promises. This transaction, although it was hailed at the time as a triumph of the policy of France, was in truth as fatal to the monarch as it was discreditable to the minister. It was accomplished by a mixture of secrecy and violence. 

It was defended by subterfuges. Its immediate effect was to destroy the Anglo-French alliance, and to throw Guizot into closer relations with the reactionary policy of Metternich and the Northern courts.

His first object as prime minister was to unite and discipline the moderate liberal party, which had been broken up by previous dissensions and ministerial changes. In this he entirely succeeded by his courage and eloquence as a parliamentary leader, and by the use of all those means of influence which France supplied to a dominant minister. No one ever doubted the purity and disinterestedness of Guizot&#x27;s own conduct. He despised money; he lived and died poor; and though he encouraged the fever of money-getting in the French nation, his own habits retained their primitive simplicity. But he did not disdain to use in others the baser passions from which he was himself free. Some of his instruments were mean; he employed them to deal with meanness after its kind.

In 1846, the opposition accused the government of buying the votes of the electorate. Guizot acknowledged that corruption happened but the government could not really prevent it. Non-voters exaggerated the occurrences of corruption to point to their need for enfranchisement. Guizot utterly failed to satisfy the demand for expansion of suffrage. 

Some scholars point out that corruption, while certainly present, did not have a large effect on the voting records of those in the Chamber of Deputies.

The strength of Guizot&#x27;s oration was his straightforward style of speaking. He was essentially a ministerial speaker, far more powerful in defence than in opposition. Nor was he less a master of parliamentary tactics and of those sudden changes and movements in debate which, as in a battle, sometimes change the fortune of the day. His confidence in himself, and in the majority of the chamber which he had moulded to his will, was unbounded; and long success and the habit of authority led him to forget that in a country like France there was a people outside the chamber elected by a small constituency, to which the minister and the king himself were held responsible.

Guizot&#x27;s view of politics was essentially historical and philosophical. His tastes and his acquirements gave him little insight into the practical business of administrative government. Of finance he knew nothing; trade and commerce were strange to him; military and naval affairs were unfamiliar to him; all these subjects he dealt with by second hand through his friends, Pierre Sylvain Dumon (1797–1870), Charles Marie Tanneguy, Comte Duchâttel (1803–1867), or Marshal Bugeaud. The consequence was that few measures of practical improvement were carried by his administration. Still less did the government lend an ear to the cry for parliamentary reform.

On this subject the king&#x27;s prejudices were insurmountable, and his ministers had the weakness to give way to them. It was impossible to defend a system which confined the suffrage to 200,000 citizens and returned a chamber of whom half were placemen. Nothing would have been easier than to strengthen the moderate liberal party by attaching the suffrage to the possession of land in France, but blank resistance was the sole answer of the government to the moderate demands of the opposition. Warning after warning was addressed to them in vain by friends and by foes alike, and they remained profoundly unconscious of their danger till the moment when it overwhelmed them.

==1848 Revolution==

In the afternoon of 23 February 1848, King Louis-Philippe summoned Guizot from the chamber, which was then sitting, and informed him that considering the situation in Paris and elsewhere in the country during the Banquet agitation for electoral reform, and the alarm and division of opinion in the royal family, led him to doubt whether he could retain Guizot as his prime minister. Guizot instantly resigned, returning to the chamber only to announce that the administration was at an end and that the king had sent for Louis-Mathieu Molé. 

Molé failed in the attempt to form a government, and between midnight and one in the morning Guizot, who had according to his custom retired early to rest, was again sent for to the Tuileries. The king asked his advice. &quot;We are no longer the ministers of your Majesty,&quot; replied Guizot; &quot;it rests with others to decide on the course to be pursued. But one thing appears to be evident: this street riot must be put down; these barricades must be taken; and for this purpose my opinion is that Marshal Bugeaud should be invested with full power, and ordered to take the necessary military measures, and as your Majesty has at this moment no minister, I am ready to draw up and countersign such an order.&quot; The marshal, who was present, undertook the task, saying, &quot;I have never been beaten yet, and I shall not begin to-morrow. The barricades shall be carried before dawn.&quot; 

Adolphe Thiers and Barrot decided to withdraw the troops. Guizot found a safe refuge in Paris for some days in the lodging of a humble miniature painter whom he had befriended, and shortly afterwards escaped across the Belgian frontier and from there to London, where he arrived on 3 March. His mother and daughters had preceded him, and he was speedily installed in a modest habitation in Pelham Crescent, Brompton.

The society of England, though many people disapproved of much of his recent policy, received the fallen statesman with as much distinction and respect as they had shown the king&#x27;s ambassador in 1840. A professorship at Oxford was spoken of, which he was unable to accept. He stayed in England about a year, devoting himself again to history. Back in Paris in 1850, Guizot published two more volumes on the English revolution -- &quot;Pourquoi la Révolution d&#x27;Angleterre a-t-elle reussi?&quot; and &quot;Discours sur l&#x27;histoire, de la Révolution d&#x27;Angleterre&quot;. In February 1850 Karl Marx and Frederick Engels co-wrote a critical assessment of this two-volume history. 
==Later life==
After having resigned as Prime Minister of France, he left politics. He was aware that the link between himself and public life was broken forever, and he never made the slightest attempt to renew it. The greater part of the year he spent at his residence at Val Richer, a former cistercian monastery near Lisieux in Normandy, which had been sold at the time of the first Revolution. His two daughters married two descendants of the patrician family De Witt of Amsterdam, not be confused with the illustrious Dordrecht family De Witt of former Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt. Both where so congenial in faith and manners to the Huguenots of France, kept his house. One of his sons-in-law farmed the estate. Guizot devoted his later years with undiminished energy to literary labour, which was in fact his chief means of subsistence. 

In 1854, Guizot published his &quot;Histoire de la république d&#x27;Angleterre et de Cromwell&quot; (2 vols., 1854), then his &quot;Histoire du protectorat de Cromwell et du rétablissement des Stuarts&quot; (2 vols., 1856). He also published an essay on Peel, and amid many essays on religion, during the ten years 1858–1868, appeared the extensive &quot;Mémoires pour servir à l&#x27;histoire de mon temps&quot;, in nine volumes. His speeches were included in 1863 in his &quot;Histoire parlementaire de la France&quot; (5 vols. of parliamentary speeches, 1863).

As his grandchildren grew up around him, he began to teach them French history. From these lessons sprang his last work, the &quot;Histoire de France racontée à mes petits enfants&quot;. The history came down to 1789, and was continued to 1870 by his daughter Madame Guizot de Witt from her father&#x27;s notes.
===Learned societies===
Two institutions may be said even under the Second Empire to have retained their freedom: the Institut de France and the Protestant Consistory. In both of these Guizot continued to the last to take an active part. He was a member of three of the five academies into which the Institute of France is divided. The Academy of Moral and Political Science owed its restoration to him, and he became in 1832 one of its first associates. The Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres elected him in 1833 as the successor to Dacier. In 1836, he was selected as a member of the Académie Française, the highest literary distinction of the country. In these learned bodies Guizot continued for nearly forty years to take a lively interest and to exercise a powerful influence. He was a keen advocate of their independence. His voice had the greatest weight in the choice of new candidates; the younger generation of French writers never looked in vain to him for encouragement, and his constant aim was to maintain the dignity and purity of the profession of letters. In 1842, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.

===Protestant Consistory===
In the consistory of the Protestant church in Paris Guizot exercised a similar influence. His early education and his experience of life conspired to strengthen the convictions of a religious temperament. He remained throughout his life a firm believer in the truths of revelation, and a volume of &quot;Meditations on the Christian Religion&quot; was one of his latest works. But though he adhered inflexibly to the church of his fathers and combated the rationalist tendencies of the age, which seemed to threaten it with destruction, he retained not a tinge of the intolerance or asperity of the Calvinistic creed. He respected in the Church of Rome the faith of the majority of his countrymen, and the writings of the great Catholic prelates, Bossuet and Bourdaloue, were as familiar and as dear to him as those of his own persuasion, and were commonly used by him in the daily exercises of family worship.

==Death and legacy==
Down to the summer of 1874 Guizot&#x27;s mental vigour and activity were unimpaired. He died peacefully, and is said to have recited verses of Pierre Corneille and texts from the Bible on his death-bed.

During the 1820s, Guizot was among the darlings of the European liberal intelligentsia. His historical works such as &quot;Histoire générale de la civilisation en Europe&quot; (1828) and &quot;Histoire de la civilisation en France&quot; (1830) were widely admired by thinkers including John Stuart Mill (&quot;I have dinned into people&#x27;s ears that Guizot is a great thinker and writer&quot;), Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (&quot;Guizot is a man after my own heart...He possesses deep knowledge, combined with an enlightened liberality&quot;), Charles Sainte-Beuve (&quot;this astonishing man about whom one could say so many things&quot;), and Alexis de Tocqueville. In 1840, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Guizot&#x27;s later resolute opposition to universal suffrage has led his critics to argue that he was a conservative or even reactionary. However, it is more accurate to describe Guizot as a proponent of the &quot;juste milieu&quot; or political centrism that defended representative government against absolutism and the excesses of democracy. His doctrine of the sovereignty of reason was intended as a liberal strategy to divide and limit sovereignty, and to consolidate the constitutional gains of the Charter of 1814. He likewise called for the abolition of capital punishment. His ideas influenced subsequent liberal reformers throughout Europe such as József Eötvös in Hungary, Johan Rudolph Thorbecke in the Netherlands, and José Ortega y Gasset in Spain.

In recent years, the scholarship of Pierre Rosanvallon, Larry Siedentop, Ivo Mosley and Aurelian Crăiuțu has renewed interest in Guizot&#x27;s political thought and the Doctrinaires more generally.

<doc id="183637" wikidata="Q7833524" url="?curid=183637" title="Trans-European road network">
<text>The Trans-European road network (TERN) was defined by Council Decision 93/629/EEC of 29 October 1993, and is a project to improve the internal road infrastructure of the European Union (EU). The TERN project is one of several Trans-European Transport Networks.

Decision 93/629/EEC expired on 30 June 1995 so it was further expanded by the Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, which added definition not only to the proposed road network, but to other Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T), as they came to be called.

This Decision is no longer in force either since it was replaced by Decision No 661/2010/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010 on Union guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network.

== Details of the road network ==

The trans-European road network, as laid out by Article 9 of Decision 661/2010/EU, is to include motorways and high-quality roads, whether existing, new or to be adapted, which:
* play an important role in long-distance traffic; or
* bypass the main urban centres on the routes identified by the network; or
* provide interconnection with other modes of transport; or
* link landlocked and peripheral regions to central regions of the Union.

Beyond these, the network should guarantee users a high, uniform and continuous level of services, comfort and safety.
It has also include infrastructure for traffic management, user information, dealing with incidents and emergencies and electronic fee collection, such infrastructure being based on active cooperation between traffic management systems at European, national and regional level and providers of travel and traffic information and value added services, which will ensure the necessary complementarity with applications whose deployment is facilitated under the trans-European telecommunications networks programme.

== Selected TERN projects ==
*Øresund Bridge, Denmark &amp; Sweden (1992–1994)
*Sidcup Bypass, London, United Kingdom (1985)
*M25 motorway upgrades, UK (1985)
*M20 motorway upgrades, UK (1986, 1989)
*E-18 (Nordic Triangle) route in Finland (1995–2001)
*A6 extensions in Germany (1997)
*A43 improvements in Maurienne, France (1998)
*A8 autobahn, Germany (2000)
*N-340 from Cádiz to Barcelona via Málaga, Spain (2001)
*A1 and A2 (east-west) motorways, Greece (1990–2004)
*Ireland-UK-Benelux Link

== Projects of common interest ==

In addition to specific priority axes and projects, projects of common interest form a common objective, the implementation of which depends on their degree of maturity and the availability of financial resources. Any project is of common interest which fulfils the criteria established in Article 7 of Decision 661/2010/EU.

<doc id="183647" wikidata="Q4771794" url="?curid=183647" title="Anthimeria">
<text>In rhetoric, anthimeria or antimeria (from , , &#x27;against, opposite&#x27;, and ), means using one part of speech as another, such as using a noun as a verb: &quot;The little old lady turtled along the road.&quot; In linguistics, this is called conversion; when a noun becomes a verb, it is a denominal verb, when a verb becomes a noun, it is a deverbal noun.

In English, many nouns have become verbs. For example, the noun &quot;book&quot; is now often used as a verb, as in the example &quot;Let&#x27;s book the flight&quot;. Other noun-as-verb usages include &quot;I can keyboard that for you,&quot; &quot;We need to scissor expenses,&quot; and &quot;Desk him.&quot; Other substitutions could include an adjective used as a noun, as in &quot;She dove into the foaming wet,&quot; interjection as verb, as in &quot;Don&#x27;t &quot;aha&quot; me!&quot; a verb as a noun, as in &quot;Help! I need some eat!&quot; and so on.

==Examples==

* I&#x27;ll &quot;unhair&quot; thy head. (Shakespeare, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, II, v.)
* The thunder would not &quot;peace&quot; at my bidding. (Shakespeare, &quot;King Lear&quot;, IV, vi.)
* Me, &quot;dictionary-ing&quot; heavily, &quot;Where was the one they were watching?&quot; (Ernest Hemingway, &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot;)

Anthimeria is common in English. For example, &quot;chill&quot; was originally a noun, a synonym for &quot;cold&quot;, but has become a verb, with meanings &quot;to make cold&quot; and, more recently, &quot;to relax&quot;. An early example of this usage is in The Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s 1979 hit &#x27;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&#x27;: &quot;There&#x27;s... a time to break and a time to chill/ To act civilized or act real ill&quot;.

Medal has found its use verbally.

===Slash===
A more unusual case of anthimeria is displayed not through a change in lexical category but a change in form altogether. The punctuation mark &#x27;/&#x27; was originally used to juxtapose related words or phrases, such as a &#x27;friend/roommate&#x27;, meaning that the referred person is both a friend and a roommate. The symbol &#x27;/&#x27; (technically, named &quot;virgule&quot;) is often pronounced &#x27;slash&#x27;, and now often used as a kind of conjunction or conjunctive adverb: &quot;emergence of a new conjunction/conjunctive adverb (let alone one stemming from a punctuation mark) is like a rare-bird sighting in the world of linguistics: an innovation in the slang of young people embedding itself as a function word in the language&quot;.

The meaning of the virgule, pronounced &quot;slash&quot; and written &#x27;/&#x27;, has evolved into multiple contextual uses, including &quot;distinguishing between (a) the activity that the speaker or writer was intending to do or should have been doing, and (b) the activity that the speaker or writer actually did or anticipated they would do...&quot;. &#x27;Slash&#x27; has been used to &quot;link a second related thought or clause to the first&quot; as well as simply &quot;introduc[ing] an afterthought that is also a topic shift&quot;. A few examples include:

* &quot;I went to class slash caught up on &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;Does anyone care if my cousin comes and visit slash stays with us Friday night?&quot;
* &quot;Has anyone seen my moccasins anywhere? Slash were they given to someone to wear home ever?&quot;

==Temporary and permanent usage==
Some anthimeria is a fad or nonce usage. Other words have become permanent additions to English vocabulary, as with &#x27;chill&#x27;. &#x27;Slash&#x27; also appears to be developing into a permanent conjunction.

For example, for a few weeks after Clint Eastwood&#x27;s speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, &quot;Eastwooding&quot; meant talking to an empty chair, but this usage quickly disappeared.

<text>In rhetoric, meiosis is a euphemistic figure of speech that intentionally understates something or implies that it is lesser in significance or size than it really is. Meiosis is the opposite of auxesis, and is often compared to litotes. The term is derived from the Greek (&quot;to make smaller&quot;, &quot;to diminish&quot;). The satirical technique diminution often involves meiosis.

==Examples==

===Historical===

*&quot;(Our) peculiar institution&quot;, for slavery and its economic ramifications in the American South.
* &quot;The Recent Unpleasantness&quot;, used in the 19th century, again in the American South, as an idiom to refer to the American Civil War and its aftermath.
*&quot;The Emergency&quot;, a term used in the Republic of Ireland for the conflict that the rest of the world called the Second World War.
*In his surrender broadcast, the Japanese emperor Hirohito said that &quot;the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan&#x27;s advantage&quot; (Classical Japanese: ), a week after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
*&quot;The Troubles&quot;, a name for decades of violence in Northern Ireland.

===Other===
*&quot;The Pond&quot;, for the Atlantic Ocean (&quot;across the pond&quot;). Similarly, &quot;The Ditch&quot; for the Tasman Sea, between Australia and New Zealand.
*&quot;The outback&quot;; under its original etymology in the late 19th century, this was a meiosis comparison between the vast empty regions of central Australia and the backyard of a house; but its usage today is so common and so far distanced from its etymology that the meiosis effect has been lost.
*&quot;Intolerable meiosis!&quot; comments a character in William Golding&#x27;s &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; as their ship encounters an iceberg, responding to another character&#x27;s comment, &quot;We are privileged. How many people have seen anything like this?&quot;

<doc id="183652" wikidata="Q309829" url="?curid=183652" title="Ken Wilber">
<text>Kenneth Earl Wilber II (born January 31, 1949) is an American theorist and writer on transpersonal psychology and his own integral theory, a four-quadrant grid which purports to encompass all human knowledge and experience.

==Life and career==
Wilber was born in 1949 in Oklahoma City. In 1967 he enrolled as a pre-med student at Duke University. He became interested in psychology and Eastern spirituality. He left Duke and enrolled at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln studying biochemistry, but after a few years dropped out of university and began studying his own curriculum and writing.

In 1973 Wilber completed his first book, &quot;The Spectrum of Consciousness&quot;, in which he sought to integrate knowledge from disparate fields. After rejections by more than 20 publishers it was accepted in 1977 by Quest Books, and he spent a year giving lectures and workshops before going back to writing, publishing &quot;The Atman Project&quot;, in which he put his idea of a spectrum of consciousness in a developmental context. He also helped to launch the journal &quot;ReVision&quot; in 1978.

In 1982, New Science Library published his anthology &quot;The Holographic Paradigm and Other Paradoxes&quot;, a collection of essays and interviews, including one by David Bohm. The essays, including one of his own, looked at how holography and the holographic paradigm relate to the fields of consciousness, mysticism, and science.

In 1983, Wilber married Terry &quot;Treya&quot; Killam who was shortly thereafter diagnosed with breast cancer. From 1984 until 1987, Wilber gave up most of his writing to care for her. Killam died in January 1989; their joint experience was recorded in the 1991 book &quot;Grace and Grit&quot;.

In 1987, Wilber moved to Boulder, Colorado, where he worked on his Kosmos trilogy and supervised the work and functioning of the Integral Institute.

Wilber wrote &quot;Sex, Ecology, Spirituality&quot; (1995), the first volume of his &quot;Kosmos Trilogy&quot;, presenting his &quot;theory of everything,&quot; a four-quadrant grid in which he summarized his reading in psychology and Eastern and Western philosophy up to that time. &quot;A Brief History of Everything&quot; (1996) was the popularised summary of &quot;Sex, Ecology, Spirituality&quot; in interview format. &quot;The Eye of Spirit&quot; (1997) was a compilation of articles he had written for the journal &quot;ReVision&quot; on the relationship between science and religion. Throughout 1997, he had kept journals of his personal experiences, which were published in 1999 as &quot;One Taste&quot;, a term for unitary consciousness. Over the next two years his publisher, Shambhala Publications, released eight re-edited volumes of his &quot;Collected Works&quot;. In 1999, he finished &quot;Integral Psychology&quot; and wrote &quot;A Theory of Everything&quot; (2000). In &quot;A Theory of Everything&quot; Wilber attempts to bridge business, politics, science and spirituality and show how they integrate with theories of developmental psychology, such as Spiral Dynamics. His novel, &quot;Boomeritis&quot; (2002), attempts to expose what he perceives as the egotism of the baby boom generation. Frank Visser&#x27;s &quot;Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion&quot; (2003), a guide to Wilber&#x27;s thought, was praised by Edward J. Sullivan and Daryl S. Paulson, with the latter calling it &quot;an outstanding synthesis of Wilber&#x27;s published works through the evolution of his thoughts over time. The book will be of value to any transpersonal humanist or integral philosophy student who does not want to read all of Wilber&#x27;s works to understand his message.&quot;

In 2012, Wilber joined the advisory board of the International Simultaneous Policy Organization which seeks to end the usual deadlock in tackling global issues through an international simultaneous policy.

Wilber stated in 2011 that he has long suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome, possibly caused by RNase enzyme deficiency disease.

==Integral theory==

All Quadrants All Levels (AQAL, pron. &quot;ah-qwul&quot;) is the basic framework of integral theory. It models human knowledge and experience with a four-quadrant grid, along the axes of &quot;interior-exterior&quot; and &quot;individual-collective&quot;. According to Wilber, it is a comprehensive approach to reality, a metatheory that attempts to explain how academic disciplines and every form of knowledge and experience fit together coherently.

AQAL is based on four fundamental concepts and a rest-category: four quadrants, several levels and lines of development, several states of consciousness, and &quot;types&quot;, topics which do not fit into these four concepts. &quot;Levels&quot; are the stages of development, from pre-personal through personal to transpersonal. &quot;Lines&quot; of development are various domains which may progress unevenly through different stages. &quot;States&quot; are states of consciousness; according to Wilber persons may have a temporal experience of a higher developmental stage. &quot;Types&quot; is a rest-category, for phenomena which do not fit in the other four concepts. In order for an account of the Kosmos to be complete, Wilber believes that it must include each of these five categories. For Wilber, only such an account can be accurately called &quot;integral&quot;. In the essay, &quot;Excerpt C: The Ways We Are in This Together&quot;, Wilber describes AQAL as &quot;one suggested architecture of the Kosmos&quot;.

The model&#x27;s apex is formless awareness, &quot;the simple feeling of being&quot;, which is equated with a range of &quot;ultimates&quot; from a variety of eastern traditions. This formless awareness transcends the phenomenal world, which is ultimately only an appearance of some transcendental reality. According to Wilber, the AQAL categories — quadrants, lines, levels, states, and types – describe the relative truth of the two truths doctrine of Buddhism. According to Wilber, none of them are true in an absolute sense. Only formless awareness, &quot;the simple feeling of being&quot;, exists absolutely.

==Other ideas==

===Mysticism and the great chain of being===
One of Wilber&#x27;s main interests is in mapping what he calls the &quot;neo-perennial philosophy&quot;, an integration of some of the views of mysticism typified by Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;The Perennial Philosophy&quot; with an account of cosmic evolution akin to that of the Indian mystic Sri Aurobindo. He rejects most of the tenets of Perennialism and the associated anti-evolutionary view of history as a regression from past ages or yugas. Instead, he embraces a more traditionally Western notion of the great chain of being. As in the work of Jean Gebser, this great chain (or &quot;nest&quot;) is ever-present while relatively unfolding throughout this material manifestation, although to Wilber &quot;... the &#x27;Great Nest&#x27; is actually just a vast morphogenetic field of potentials ...&quot; In agreement with Mahayana Buddhism, and Advaita Vedanta, he believes that reality is ultimately a nondual union of emptiness and form, with form being innately subject to development over time.

===Theory of truth===


Wilber believes that the mystical traditions of the world provide access to, and knowledge of, a transcendental reality which is perennial, consistent throughout all times and cultures. This proposition underlies the whole of his conceptual edifice, and is an unquestioned assumption. According to David L. McMahan, the perennial position is &quot;largely dismissed by scholars&quot;, but &quot;has lost none of its popularity&quot;. Mainstream academia favor a constructivist approach, which is rejected by Wilber as a dangerous relativism. Wilber juxtaposes this generalization to plain materialism, presented as the main paradigm of regular science.

In his later works, Wilber argues that manifest reality is composed of four domains, and that each domain, or &quot;quadrant&quot;, has its own truth-standard, or test for validity:
* &quot;Interior individual/1st person&quot;: the subjective world, the individual subjective sphere;
* &quot;Interior collective/2nd person&quot;: the intersubjective space, the cultural background;
* &quot;Exterior individual/3rd person&quot;: the objective state of affairs;
* &quot;Exterior collective/3rd person&quot;: the functional fit, &quot;how entities fit together in a system&quot;.

===Pre/trans fallacy===
Wilber believes that many claims about non-rational states make a mistake he calls the pre/trans fallacy. According to Wilber, the non-rational stages of consciousness (what Wilber calls &quot;pre-rational&quot; and &quot;trans-rational&quot; stages) can be easily confused with one another. In Wilber&#x27;s view, one can reduce trans-rational spiritual realization to pre-rational regression, or one can elevate pre-rational states to the trans-rational domain. For example, Wilber claims that Freud and Jung commit this fallacy. Freud considered mystical realization to be a regression to infantile oceanic states. Wilber alleges that Freud thus commits a fallacy of reduction. Wilber thinks that Jung commits the converse form of the same mistake by considering pre-rational myths to reflect divine realizations. Likewise, pre-rational states may be misidentified as post-rational states. Wilber characterizes himself as having fallen victim to the pre/trans fallacy in his early work.

===Wilber on science===
Wilber describes the state of the &quot;hard&quot; sciences as limited to &quot;narrow science&quot;, which only allows evidence from the lowest realm of consciousness, the (the five senses and their extensions). Wilber sees science in the broad sense as characterized by involving three steps:

* specifying an experiment,
* performing the experiment and observing the results, and
* checking the results with others who have competently performed the same experiment.
He has presented these as &quot;three strands of valid knowledge&quot; in Part III of his book &quot;The Marriage of Sense and Soul&quot;.

What Wilber calls &quot;broad science&quot; would include evidence from logic, mathematics, and from the symbolic, hermeneutical, and other realms of consciousness. Ultimately and ideally, broad science would include the testimony of meditators and spiritual practitioners. Wilber&#x27;s own conception of science includes both narrow science and broad science, e.g., using electroencephalogram machines and other technologies to test the experiences of meditators and other spiritual practitioners, creating what Wilber calls &quot;integral science&quot;.

According to Wilber&#x27;s theory, narrow science trumps narrow religion, but broad science trumps narrow science. That is, the natural sciences provide a more inclusive, accurate account of reality than any of the particular exoteric religious traditions. But an integral approach that uses intersubjectivity to evaluate both religious claims and scientific claims will give a more complete account of reality than narrow science.

Wilber has referred to Stuart Kauffman, Ilya Prigogine, Alfred North Whitehead, and others who also articulate his vitalistic and teleological understanding of reality, which is deeply at odds with the modern evolutionary synthesis.

===Later work===
In 2005, at the launch of the Integral Spiritual Center, a branch of the Integral Institute, Wilber presented a 118-page rough draft summary of his two forthcoming books. The essay is entitled &quot;What is Integral Spirituality?&quot;, and contains several new ideas, including Integral post-metaphysics and the Wilber-Combs lattice. In 2006, he published &quot;Integral Spirituality&quot;, in which he elaborated on these ideas, as well as others such as Integral Methodological Pluralism and the developmental conveyor belt of religion.

&quot;Integral post-metaphysics&quot; is the term Wilber has given to his attempts to reconstruct the world&#x27;s spiritual-religious traditions in a way that accounts for the modern and post-modern criticisms of those traditions.

The Wilber-Combs Lattice is a conceptual model of consciousness developed by Wilber and Allan Combs. It is a grid with sequential states of consciousness on the x axis (from left to right) and with developmental structures, or levels, of consciousness on the y axis (from bottom to top). This lattice illustrates how each structure of consciousness interprets experiences of different states of consciousness, including mystical states, in different ways.

Wilber attracted a lot of controversy from 2011 to the present day by supporting Marc Gafni, who was accused of sexually assaulting a minor, on his blog. A petition begun by a group of Rabbis has called for Wilber to publicly dissociate from Gafni.

Wilber is on the advisory board of Mariana Bozesan&#x27;s AQAL Capital GmbH, a Munich-based company specialising in integral impact investing using a model based on Wilber&#x27;s Integral Theory.

==Influences==
Wilber&#x27;s views have been influenced by Madhyamaka Buddhism, particularly as articulated in the philosophy of Nagarjuna. Wilber has practiced various forms of Buddhist meditation, studying (however briefly) with a number of teachers, including Dainin Katagiri, Taizan Maezumi, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Kalu Rinpoche, Alan Watts, Penor Rinpoche and Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche. Advaita Vedanta, Trika (Kashmir) Shaivism, Tibetan Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, Ramana Maharshi, and Andrew Cohen can be mentioned as further influences. Wilber has on several occasions singled out Adi Da&#x27;s work for the highest praise while expressing reservations about Adi Da as a teacher. In &quot;Sex, Ecology, Spirituality&quot;, Wilber refers extensively to Plotinus&#x27; philosophy, which he sees as nondual. While Wilber has practised Buddhist meditation methods, he does not identify himself as a Buddhist.

According to Frank Visser, Wilber&#x27;s conception of four quadrants, or dimensions of existence is very similar to E. F. Schumacher&#x27;s conception of four fields of knowledge. Visser finds Wilber&#x27;s conception of levels, as well as Wilber&#x27;s critique of science as one-dimensional, to be very similar to that in Huston Smith&#x27;s &quot;Forgotten Truth&quot;. Visser also writes that the esoteric aspects of Wilber&#x27;s theory are based on the philosophy of Sri Aurobindo as well as other theorists including Adi Da.

==Reception==
Wilber has been categorized by Wouter J. Hanegraaff as New Age due to his emphasis on a transpersonal view. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; has called him &quot;the Hegel of Eastern spirituality&quot;.

Wilber is credited with broadening the appeal of a &quot;perennial philosophy&quot; to a much wider audience. Cultural figures as varied as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Deepak Chopra, Richard Rohr, and musician Billy Corgan have mentioned his influence. Paul M. Helfrich credits him with &quot;precocious understanding that transcendental experience is not solely pathological, and properly developed could greatly inform human development&quot;. However, Wilber&#x27;s approach has been criticized as excessively categorizing and objectifying, masculinist, commercializing spirituality, and denigrating of emotion. Critics in multiple fields cite problems with Wilber&#x27;s interpretations and inaccurate citations of his wide ranging sources, as well as stylistic issues with gratuitous repetition, excessive book length, and hyperbole.

Frank Visser writes that Wilber&#x27;s 1977 book &quot;The Spectrum of Consciousness&quot; was praised by transpersonal psychologists, but also that support for him &quot;even in transpersonal circles&quot; had waned by the early 1990s. Edward J. Sullivan argued, in his review of Visser&#x27;s guide &quot;Ken Wilber: Thought as Passion&quot;, that in the field of composition studies &quot;Wilber&#x27;s melding of life’s journeys with abstract theorizing could provide an eclectic and challenging model of &#x27;personal-academic&#x27; writing&quot;, but that &quot;teachers of writing may be critical of his all-too-frequent totalizing assumptions&quot;. Sullivan also said that Visser&#x27;s book overall gave an impression that Wilber &quot;should think more and publish less.&quot;

Steve McIntosh praises Wilber&#x27;s work but also argues that Wilber fails to distinguish &quot;philosophy&quot; from his own Vedantic and Buddhist religion. Christopher Bache is complimentary of some aspects of Wilber&#x27;s work, but calls Wilber&#x27;s writing style glib.

Psychiatrist Stanislav Grof has praised Wilber&#x27;s knowledge and work in the highest terms; however, Grof has criticized the omission of the pre- and peri-natal domains from Wilber&#x27;s spectrum of consciousness, and Wilber&#x27;s neglect of the psychological importance of biological birth and death. Grof has described Wilber&#x27;s writings as having an &quot;often aggressive polemical style that includes strongly worded &quot;ad personam&quot; attacks and is not conducive to personal dialogue.&quot; Wilber&#x27;s response is that the world religious traditions do not attest to the importance that Grof assigns to the perinatal.

<doc id="183654" wikidata="Q15304350" url="?curid=183654" title="ThaiBev">
<text>Thai Beverage, better known as ThaiBev() (), is Thailand&#x27;s largest and one of Southeast Asia&#x27;s largest beverage companies, with distilleries in Thailand, UK, and China. It is owned by Thai Chinese billionaire business magnate Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi. Listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange, Thai Beverage plc has a market capitalization in excess of US$13 billion.

In 2004, the firm announced it had succeeded in a US$11.2 billion deal to take over the conglomerate Fraser and Neave, adding to the group&#x27;s portfolio of assets.

==History==
ThaiBev was founded on 29 October 2003 with the consolidation of 58 beer and spirits businesses, among them Chang beer, second in the beer market after Singha. ThaiBev brands include green-tea beverage Oishi and Est, a cola. The Sirivadhanabhakdi family&#x27;s stake in Thai Beverage is around 30%. Charoen is chairman and his son Thapana serves as president and CEO. Thai Beverage is listed on the Singapore stock exchange as the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) prohibits the listing of alcohol-related stocks.

== Overview ==
Thai Beverage Public Company Limited owns and distributes several significant brands, including Chang beer, Mekhong, and SangSom rum. It has significant operations in Europe, producing malt Scotch whisky, vodka, gin, and liqueurs at five distilleries in Scotland, UK. 

Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, in early 2013, added Fraser and Neave, Limited, a food and beverage, brewing, property, and publishing industries conglomerate in Singapore, to his drinks and property empire.

Chang Beer, which started production in March 1995 at a brewery in the Bang Ban District of Ayutthaya Province, is the top-selling brand in Thailand. It managed to win 60 percent market share in Thailand after a hard market fight with the previous leading brand, Singha. In 2006, the company&#x27;s beer market share was 49 percent, according to research company Canadean.

== Beer ==
===Chang===

ThaiBev brews Chang (or Chang Beer) (), a pale lager. &quot;Chang&quot; () is the Thai word for elephant, an animal of cultural and historical significance in Thailand. The logo depicts two elephants face-to-face. In 2006, the company launched Chang Light, 4.2 percent and Chang Draught in bottles at five percent ABV. They were discontinued in 2015.

In 2015, ThaiBev celebrated its &quot;20th anniversary Chang Beer&quot;. For this occasion, ThaiBev consolidated all Chang brands in Chang Classic. ThaiBev stopped production of Chang Light, Chang Draught, and Chang Export. In addition, the new bottle was introduced in emerald green. Production of Chang Classic is shared between ThaiBev&#x27;s three breweries. The recipe was changed to include rice, previously only used in the domestic 6.4 percent version. Its ABV in Thailand is 4.8 percent (Accurate as of August 2024).

ThaiBev&#x27;s flagship brand Chang Beer won a gold quality award three times in the beers, water, and soft drinks category at the World Quality Selections 2018, organized each year by Monde Selection.

===Archa===
In 2004, the company introduced Archa ( &#x27;horse&#x27;) beer, at 5.4 percent . Archa won a gold medal at the 2007 Australian International Beer Awards (AIBA). The ABV was lowered to five percent in 2014. The first market outside Thailand to distribute Archa Beer was Singapore, where it was successfully launched in 2012 by InterBev (Singapore) Ltd.

===Federbräu=== 
Federbräu is a German-inspired quality beer brewed using imported German malt, using only a single source of malt in the brewing process. Federbräu is five percent alcohol by volume.

===Chang/Carlsberg===
In December 2000, Carlsberg and Chang established a 50–50 joint venture, Carlsberg Asia, to create a significant brewing company in Asia. The Carlsberg influence can be seen in the typography of the &quot;Beer Chang&quot; logo, which resembles the classic &quot;Carlsberg Beer&quot;.
In 2005, Carlsberg pulled out of the venture and terminated its licence agreement with Chang due to non-fulfillment of contractual obligations, resulting in Chang claiming US$2.5 billion in damages. A final settlement of US$120 million was subsequently paid by Carlsberg.

===Saigon and 333===
ThaiBev bought a majority of shares in Sabeco in 2018 for $4.8 billion US dollars. Sabeco owns leading beer brands in Vietnam including &quot;Saigon Beer&quot; and &quot;333&quot;. At the time of the acquisition, Sabeco&#x27;s Vietnam market share had fallen below 40 percent.

== Spirits ==
ThaiBev produces brown and white spirits, including rum.

ThaiBev&#x27;s most famous, but not best selling, spirit is &quot;Mekhong&quot;, which originated in 1941 at the Bangyikhan Distillery west of Bangkok. Originally a state-owned distillery, it dates back over 200 years to the beginning of the current Chakri dynasty. The launch of &quot;Mekhong&quot; (a rum with added rice) was aimed at producing a high-quality Thai spirit to stem the increase in the import of foreign liquor and to eventually replace imported brands. &quot;SangSom&quot; (rum), however, has been the country&#x27;s most popular spirit brand for over 29 years, until 2006 holding almost 50 percent share of the entire brown spirits market in Thailand. The company also produces Mungkorn Thong and Hong Thong and brands based on whisky, such as Blend 285, Crown 99 and Blue, Meridian a brand of V.S.O.P. brandy, as well as Scotch whisky brands such as Hankey Banister and Pinwinnie Royal Scotch Whisky.

White spirits are made from molasses without any mixture or colour, and produced in four alcohol contents: 28, 30, 35, and 40 percent. The company&#x27;s largest-selling white spirits is &quot;Ruang Khao&quot;. The labels are colour-coded to reflect the alcoholic strength but do not have the brand name printed on them. Other brands in this category are Niyomthai and White Tiger.

=== Production ===
Molasses are the main raw material used for the production of ThaiBev&#x27;s spirits, so that most of the products fall under the category of rum. As is the case with all distilled spirits, the distillate is crystal clear when first distilled. Amber and dark brown spirits obtain their colour from the extracts from the oak barrel during aging and from caramel, a natural coloring agent.

ThaiBev&#x27;s yeast cultures, used for fermentation, are grown in its own laboratory and propagated in a yeast propagation tank. The yeast, molasses diluted by water, steamed rice that has been sprayed with mould (to create sugar) and incubated for four days, and water are added into a fermenter and the mixture is allowed to ferment for approximately 72 hours. The liquid that is left at the end of the fermentation process is known as &quot;fermented mash&quot;.

Distillation takes place in a distilling column and a pot still, which is a large copper or stainless steel kettle. Distilling involves boiling the &quot;fermented mash&quot; and condensing its vapour. The spent sludge remaining in the pot still is removed to be processed. The company&#x27;s white spirits are then diluted with demineralized water to the desired alcohol content in a white spirits blending tank and sent to be packaged and bottled after filtering.

Brown spirits are diluted with demineralized water and then aged in oak barrels for three to eight years depending on the brand. The aged alcohol is then further diluted with demineralized water before bottling. Liquor concentrate alcohol and caramel color are added. The brown spirits are passed through filters and then bottled and packaged. ThaiBev also makes &quot;Chinese herb spirits&quot;, branded as Chiang-Chun and Sua Dum. These are produced by blending alcohol, white spirits, sugar, caramel, and Chinese herbs, and then further diluting the mixture with demineralized water.

== Everton-Chang ==

In 2004, Chang became the sponsor of Everton Football Club of the English Premier League. Together, they initiated five projects in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Thailand.

Following the 2004 tsunami that struck the Khao Lak coast in Phang Nga Province of Thailand and destroyed the village of Ban Nam Khem, ThaiBev and Everton sponsored the construction of 50 houses and a football field there, in a project dubbed Everton-Chang. Local youth teams compete for the Chang-Everton cup. Officials from Everton F.C. and Chang Beer have been involved in the project. Together, they sponsor Chang Everton Football Cup and send promising Thai footballers to Liverpool for a trial with Everton.

== Criticism and protest ==
In 2005, ThaiBev became the subject of nationwide criticism in Thailand by the Buddhist monastic community and other religious groups. At the time, Thai Beverage had announced its intent to list publicly on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), which would be the biggest listing in Thai history. Despite attempts by the National Office of Buddhism (a government agency) to prohibit monks from protesting, 2,000 monks from Wat Phra Dhammakaya organized chants of Buddhist texts in front of the Stock Exchange to halt Thai Beverage&#x27;s IPO. In an unprecedented cooperative effort, the temple was joined by former Black May revolt leader Chamlong Srimuang and the Santi Asoke movement. Subsequently, another 122 religious and social organizations joined the opposition, reaching numbers of 10,000 protesters. The organizations asked Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra&#x27;s cooperation to stop the company, in what some of the protest leaders described as &quot;a grave threat to the health and culture&quot; of Thai society. While SET pointed out the economic benefits of the listing, opponents referred to rising alcohol abuse in Thai society, ranking fifth in alcohol consumption according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Ultimately, the protests led to an indefinite postponement of the listing by the exchange. Thai Beverage chose to list in Singapore instead, as the Thai Stock Exchange chief resigned as a result.

<doc id="183655" wikidata="Q312224" url="?curid=183655" title="HMS Endeavour">
<text>HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; was a British Royal Navy research vessel that Lieutenant James Cook commanded to Tahiti, New Zealand and Australia on his first voyage of discovery from 1768 to 1771.

She was launched in 1764 as the collier &quot;Earl of Pembroke&quot;, with the Navy purchasing her in 1768 for a scientific mission to the Pacific Ocean and to explore the seas for the surmised &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot; or &quot;unknown southern land&quot;. Commissioned as His Majesty&#x27;s Bark &quot;Endeavour&quot;, she departed Plymouth in August 1768, rounded Cape Horn and reached Tahiti in time to observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the Sun. She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south, stopping at the islands of Huahine, Bora Bora, and Raiatea west of Tahiti to allow Cook to claim them for Great Britain. In September 1769, she anchored off New Zealand, becoming the first European vessel to reach the islands since Abel Tasman&#x27;s &quot;Heemskerck&quot; 127 years earlier.

In April 1770, &quot;Endeavour&quot; became the first European ship to reach the east coast of Australia, with Cook going ashore at what is now known as Botany Bay. &quot;Endeavour&quot; then sailed north along the Australian coast. She narrowly avoided disaster after running aground on the Great Barrier Reef, and Cook had to throw her guns overboard to lighten her. &quot;Endeavour&quot; was beached on the Australian mainland for seven weeks to permit repairs to her hull. Resuming her voyage, she limped into port in Batavia in October 1770, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands that they had visited. From Batavia &quot;Endeavour&quot; continued westward, rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771 and reached the English port of Dover on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years.

The ship was largely forgotten after her Pacific voyage, spending the next three years hauling troops and cargo to and from the Falkland Islands. She was renamed in 1775 after being sold into private hands, and used to transport timber from the Baltic. Rehired as a British troop transport during the American War of Independence, she was finally scuttled in a blockade of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, in 1778. Historical evidence indicates the ship was sunk just north of Goat Island in Newport Harbor, along with four other British transports.

Relics from &quot;Endeavour&quot; are displayed at maritime museums worldwide, including an anchor and six of her cannon. A replica of &quot;Endeavour&quot; was launched in 1994 and is berthed alongside the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney Harbour. Multiple geographic features are named after the ship, including the Endeavour River and Endeavour Reef, as were three spacecraft. The ship is depicted on the New Zealand fifty-cent coin.

==Construction==
&quot;Endeavour&quot; was originally the merchant collier &quot;Earl of Pembroke&quot;, built by Thomas Fishburn for Thomas Millner, launched in June 1764 from the coal and whaling Port of Whitby in the North Riding of Yorkshire. She was a type known locally as the &quot;Whitby Cat&quot;. She was ship-rigged and sturdily built with a broad, flat bow, a square stern and a long, box-like body with a deep hold.

A flat-bottomed design made her well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and allowed her to be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock. Her hull, internal floors, and futtocks were built from traditional white oak, her keel and stern post from elm, and her masts from pine and fir. Plans of the ship also show a double keelson to lock the keel, floors and frames in place.

There is uncertainty about the height of her standing masts, as surviving diagrams of &quot;Endeavour&quot; depict the body of the vessel only, and not the mast plan. While her main and foremast standing spars were standard for her shipyard and era, an annotation on one surviving ship plan in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich has the mizzen as &quot;16 yards 29 inches&quot; ( m). If correct, this would produce an oddly truncated mast a full shorter than the naval standards of the day. Late twentieth-century research suggests the annotation may be a transcription error with &quot;19 yards 29 inches&quot; ( m) being the true reading. If so, this would more closely conform with both naval standards and the lengths of the other masts.

==Purchase and refit by the Admiralty==
On 16 February 1768, the Royal Society petitioned King George III to finance a scientific expedition to the Pacific to study and observe the 1769 transit of Venus across the sun. Royal approval was granted for the expedition, and the Admiralty elected to combine the scientific voyage with a confidential mission to search the south Pacific for signs of the postulated continent &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot; (or &quot;unknown southern land&quot;).

The Royal Society suggested command be given to Scottish geographer Alexander Dalrymple, whose acceptance was conditional on a brevet commission as a captain in the Royal Navy. First Lord of the Admiralty Edward Hawke refused, going so far as to say he would rather cut off his right hand than give command of a navy vessel to someone not educated as a seaman. In refusing Dalrymple&#x27;s command, Hawke was influenced by previous insubordination aboard the sloop in 1698, when naval officers had refused to take orders from civilian commander Edmond Halley. The impasse was broken when the Admiralty proposed James Cook, a naval officer with a background in mathematics and cartography. Acceptable to both parties, Cook was promoted to lieutenant and named as commander of the expedition.
On 27 May 1768, Cook took command of &quot;Earl of Pembroke&quot;, valued in March at £2,307. 5s. 6d. but ultimately purchased for £2,840. 10s. 11d. and assigned for use in the Society&#x27;s expedition. She was refitted at Deptford by the dock&#x27;s master shipwright Adam Hayes on the River Thames for the sum of £2,294, almost the price of the ship herself. The hull was recaulked and copper sheathed to protect against shipworm, and a third internal deck installed to provide cabins, a powder magazine and storerooms. The new cabins provided around of floorspace apiece being allocated to Cook and the Royal Society representatives: naturalist Joseph Banks, Banks&#x27; assistants Daniel Solander and Herman Spöring, astronomer Charles Green, and artists Sydney Parkinson and Alexander Buchan. These cabins encircled the officers&#x27; mess. The great cabin at the rear of the deck was designed as a workroom for Cook and the Royal Society. On the rear lower deck, cabins facing on to the mates&#x27; mess were assigned to lieutenants Zachary Hickes and John Gore, ship&#x27;s surgeon William Monkhouse, the gunner Stephen Forwood, ship&#x27;s master Robert Molyneux, and the captain&#x27;s clerk Richard Orton. The adjoining open mess deck provided sleeping and living quarters for the marines and crew, and additional storage space.

A longboat, pinnace and yawl were provided as ship&#x27;s boats, though the longboat was rotten, having to be rebuilt and painted with white lead before it could be brought aboard. These were accompanied by two privately owned skiffs, one belonging to the boatswain John Gathrey, and the other to Banks. The ship was also equipped with a set of sweeps to allow her to be rowed forward if becalmed or demasted. The refitted vessel was commissioned as His Majesty&#x27;s Bark &quot;the Endeavour&quot;, to distinguish her from the four-gun cutter .

On 21 July 1768, &quot;Endeavour&quot; sailed to Gallions Reach on the Thames to take on armaments to protect her against potentially hostile Pacific island natives. Ten 4-pounder cannon were brought aboard, six of which were mounted on the upper deck with the remainder stowed in the hold. Twelve swivel guns were also supplied, and fixed to posts along the quarterdeck, sides and bow. The ship departed for Plymouth on 30 July, for provisioning and crew boarding of 85, including 12 Royal Marines. Cook also ordered that twelve tons of pig iron be brought on board as sailing ballast.

==Service history==

===Voyage of discovery===
====Outward voyage====
&quot;Endeavour&quot; departed Plymouth on 26 August 1768, carrying 18 months of provisions for 94 people. Livestock on board included pigs, poultry, two greyhounds and a milking goat.

The first port of call was Funchal in the Madeira Islands, which &quot;Endeavour&quot; reached on 12 September. The ship was recaulked and painted, and fresh vegetables, beef and water were brought aboard for the next leg of the voyage. While in port, an accident cost the life of master&#x27;s mate Robert Weir, who became entangled in the anchor cable and was dragged overboard when the anchor was released. To replace him, Cook pressed a sailor from an American sloop anchored nearby.

&quot;Endeavour&quot; then continued south along the coast of Africa and across the Atlantic to South America, arriving in Rio de Janeiro on 13 November 1768. Fresh food and water were brought aboard and the ship departed for Cape Horn, which she reached during stormy weather on 13 January 1769. Attempts to round the Cape over the next two days were unsuccessful, and &quot;Endeavour&quot; was repeatedly driven back by wind, rain and contrary tides. Cook noted that the seas off the Cape were large enough to regularly submerge the bow of the ship as she rode down from the crests of waves. At last, on 16 January the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the Cape and anchor in the Bay of Good Success on the Pacific coast. The crew were sent to collect wood and water, while Banks and his team gathered hundreds of plant specimens from along the icy shore. On 17 January two of Banks&#x27; servants died from cold while attempting to return to the ship during a heavy snowstorm.

&quot;Endeavour&quot; resumed her voyage on 21 January 1769, heading west-northwest into warmer weather. She reached Tahiti on 10 April, where she remained for the next three months. The transit of Venus across the Sun occurred on 3 June, and was observed and recorded by astronomer Charles Green from &quot;Endeavour&quot; deck.

====Pacific exploration====
The transit observed, &quot;Endeavour&quot; departed Tahiti on 13 July and headed northwest to allow Cook to survey and name the Society Islands. Landfall was made at Huahine, Raiatea and Borabora, providing opportunities for Cook to claim each of them as British territories. An attempt to land the pinnace on the Austral Island of Rurutu was thwarted by rough surf and the rocky shoreline. On 15 August, &quot;Endeavour&quot; finally turned south to explore the open ocean for &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot;.

In October 1769, &quot;Endeavour&quot; reached the coastline of New Zealand, becoming the first European vessel to do so since Abel Tasman&#x27;s &quot;Heemskerck&quot; in 1642. Unfamiliar with such ships, the Māori people at Cook&#x27;s first landing point in Poverty Bay thought the ship was a floating island, or a gigantic bird from their mythical homeland of Hawaiki. &quot;Endeavour&quot; spent the next six months sailing close to shore, while Cook mapped the coastline and concluded that New Zealand comprised two large islands and was not the hoped-for &quot;Terra Australis&quot;. In March 1770, the longboat from &quot;Endeavour&quot; carried Cook ashore to allow him to formally proclaim British sovereignty over New Zealand. On his return, &quot;Endeavour&quot; resumed her voyage westward, her crew sighting the east coast of Australia on 19 April. On 29 April, she became the first European vessel to make landfall on the east coast of Australia, when Cook landed one of the ship&#x27;s boats on the southern shore of what is now known as Botany Bay, New South Wales.
====Shipwreck====

For the next four months, Cook charted the coast of Australia, heading generally northward. Just before 11:00 pm on 11 June 1770, the ship struck a reef, today called Endeavour Reef, within the Great Barrier Reef system. The sails were immediately taken down, a kedging anchor set and an unsuccessful attempt was made to drag the ship back to open water. The reef &quot;Endeavour&quot; had struck rose so steeply from the seabed that although the ship was hard aground, Cook measured depths up to less than one ship&#x27;s length away.

Cook then ordered that the ship be lightened to help her float off the reef. Iron and stone ballast, spoiled stores and all but four of the ship&#x27;s guns were thrown overboard, and the ship&#x27;s drinking water pumped out. The crew attached buoys to the discarded guns with the intention of retrieving them later, but this proved impractical. Every man on board took turns on the pumps, including Cook and Banks.

When, by Cook&#x27;s reckoning, about of equipment had been thrown overboard, on the next high tide a second unsuccessful attempt was made to pull the ship free. In the afternoon of 12 June, the longboat carried out two large bower anchors, and block and tackle were rigged to the anchor chains to allow another attempt on the evening high tide. The ship had started to take on water through a hole in her hull. Although the leak would certainly increase once off the reef, Cook decided to risk the attempt and at 10:20 pm the ship was floated on the tide and successfully drawn off. The anchors were retrieved, except for one which could not be freed from the seabed and had to be abandoned.

As expected the leak increased once the ship was off the reef, and all three working pumps had to be continually manned. A mistake occurred in sounding the depth of water in the hold, when a new man measured the length of a sounding line from the outside plank of the hull where his predecessor had used the top of the cross-beams. The mistake suggested the water depth had increased by about between soundings, sending a wave of fear through the ship. As soon as the mistake was realised, redoubled efforts kept the pumps ahead of the leak.

The prospects if the ship sank were grim. The vessel was from shore and the three ship&#x27;s boats could not carry the entire crew. Despite this, Banks noted in his journal the calm efficiency of the crew in the face of danger, contrary to stories he had heard of seamen panicking or refusing orders in such circumstances.

Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse proposed fothering the ship, as he had previously been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully. He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of oakum and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into the hole in the hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop two of the three pumps.
&quot;Endeavour&quot; then resumed her course northward and parallel to the reef, the crew looking for a safe harbour in which to make repairs. On 13 June, the ship came to a broad watercourse that Cook named the Endeavour River. Cook attempted to enter the river mouth, but strong winds and rain prevented &quot;Endeavour&quot; from crossing the bar until the morning of 17 June. She grounded briefly on a sand spit but was refloated an hour later and warped into the river proper by early afternoon. The ship was promptly beached on the southern bank and careened to make repairs to the hull. Torn sails and rigging were also replaced and the hull scraped free of barnacles.

An examination of the hull showed that a piece of coral the size of a man&#x27;s fist had cleanly sliced through the timbers before breaking off. Surrounded by pieces of oakum from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef.

====Northward to Batavia====
After waiting for the wind, &quot;Endeavour&quot; resumed her voyage on the afternoon of 5 August 1770, reaching the northernmost point of Cape York Peninsula fifteen days later. On 22 August, Cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim British sovereignty over the eastern Australian mainland. Cook christened his landing place Possession Island, and ceremonial volleys of gunfire from the shore and &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s deck marked the occasion.
&quot;Endeavour&quot; then resumed her voyage westward along the coast, picking a path through intermittent shoals and reefs with the help of the pinnace, which was rowed ahead to test the water depth. By 26 August she was out of sight of land, and had entered the open waters of the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, earlier navigated by Luis Váez de Torres in 1606. To keep &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s voyages and discoveries secret, Cook confiscated the log books and journals of all on board and ordered them to remain silent about where they had been.

After a three-day layover off the island of Savu, &quot;Endeavour&quot; sailed on to Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, on 10 October. A day later lightning during a sudden tropical storm struck the ship, but the rudimentary &quot;electric chain&quot; or lightning rod that Cook had ordered rigged to &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s mast saved her from serious damage.

The ship remained in very poor condition following her grounding on the Great Barrier Reef in June. The ship&#x27;s carpenter, John Seetterly, observed that she was &quot;very leaky – makes from twelve to six inches an hour, occasioned by her main keel being wounded in many places, false keel gone from beyond the . Wounded on her side where the greatest leak is but I could not come at it for the water.&quot; An inspection of the hull revealed that some unrepaired planks were cut through to within . Cook noted it was a &quot;surprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water&quot; for the previous three-month voyage across open seas.

After riding at anchor for two weeks, &quot;Endeavour&quot; was heaved out of the water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which required careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day &quot;Endeavour&quot; weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.

====Return voyage====
Though &quot;Endeavour&quot; was now in good condition, her crew were not. During the ship&#x27;s stay in Batavia, all but 10 of the 94 people aboard had been taken ill with malaria and dysentery. By the time &quot;Endeavour&quot; set sail on 26 December, seven crew members had died and another forty were too sick to attend their duties. Over the following twelve weeks, a further 23 died from disease and were buried at sea, including Spöring, Green, Parkinson, and the ship&#x27;s surgeon William Monkhouse.

Cook attributed the sickness to polluted drinking water, and ordered that it be purified with lime juice, but this had little effect. Jonathan Monkhouse, who had proposed fothering the ship to save her from sinking on the reef, died on 6 February, followed six days later by ship&#x27;s carpenter John Seetterly, whose skilled repair work in Batavia had allowed &quot;Endeavour&quot; to resume her voyage. The health of the surviving crew members then slowly improved as the month progressed, with the last deaths from disease being three ordinary seamen on 27 February.

On 13 March 1771, &quot;Endeavour&quot; rounded the Cape of Good Hope and made port in Cape Town two days later. Those still sick were taken ashore for treatment. The ship remained in port for four weeks awaiting the recovery of the crew and undergoing minor repairs to her masts. On 15 April, the sick were brought back on board along with ten recruits from Cape Town, and &quot;Endeavour&quot; resumed her homeward voyage. The English mainland was sighted on 10 July and &quot;Endeavour&quot; entered the port of Dover two days later.

Approximately one month after his return, Cook was promoted to the rank of commander, and by November 1771 was in receipt of Admiralty Orders for a second expedition, this time aboard HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;. During his third voyage (second on &quot;Resolution&quot;), Cook was killed during his attempted kidnapping of the ruling chief of Hawaii at Kealakekua Bay on 14 February 1779.

===Later service===
While Cook was fêted for his successful voyage, &quot;Endeavour&quot; was largely forgotten. Within a week of her return to England, she was directed to Woolwich Dockyard for refitting as a naval transport. Under the command of Lieutenant James Gordon she then made three return voyages to the Falkland Islands.

The first, under the command of sailing master John Dykes, was to deliver &quot;sufficient provisions to serve 350 men to the end of the year 1772&quot;; she sailed from Portsmouth on 8 November 1771, but due to terrible weather did not arrive at Port Egmont (the British base in the Falkland Islands) until 1 March. &quot;Endeavour&quot; sailed from Port Egmont on 4 May in a three-month non-stop voyage until she anchored at Portsmouth.

The second voyage was to reduce the garrison and replace HM Sloop &quot;Hound&quot;, John Burr Commander, with a smaller vessel, namely the 36-ton shallop &quot;Penguin&quot;, commander Samuel Clayton. She was a collapsible vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart, and the pieces were stowed in &quot;Endeavour&quot;. &quot;Endeavour&quot; sailed in November with Hugh Kirkland as the sailing master, and additionally the crew of &quot;Penguin&quot;, and four ship&#x27;s carpenters whose job was to reassemble &quot;Penguin&quot; on arrival, which was 28 January 1773. On 17 April &quot;Endeavour&quot; and &quot;Hound&quot; sailed for England with their crew. One of &quot;Penguin&quot; crew was Bernard Penrose who wrote an account. Samuel Clayton also wrote an account.

The third voyage sailed in January 1774 with her purpose to evacuate the Falklands entirely as Britain was faced with political difficulties from the American Colonies, the French and the Spanish. The government assessed that if British ships and troops were engaged in America, Spain might seize the Falklands, capturing the small garrison at Port Egmont with maybe loss of life – this, it was feared, would trigger an outcry which might topple the government. &quot;Endeavour&quot; left England in January 1774, sailing from the Falklands with all the British inhabitants on 23 April, leaving a flag and plaque confirming Britain&#x27;s sovereignty.

&quot;Endeavour&quot; was paid off in September 1774, being sold in March 1775 by the Royal Navy to shipping magnate J. Mather for £645. Mather returned her to sea for at least one commercial voyage to Archangel in Russia.

Once the American War of Independence had commenced, the British government needed ships to carry troops and materiel across the Atlantic. In 1775 Mather submitted &quot;Endeavour&quot; as a transport ship, being rejected. Thinking that renaming her would fool Deptford Yard, Mather resubmitted &quot;Endeavour&quot; under the name &quot;Lord Sandwich&quot;. As &quot;Lord Sandwich&quot; she was rejected in no uncertain terms: &quot;Unfit for service. She was sold out Service Called &quot;Endeavour&quot; Bark refused before&quot;. Repairs were made, with acceptance in her third submission, under the name &quot;Lord Sandwich 2&quot; as there was already a transport ship called &quot;Lord Sandwich&quot;.

&quot;Lord Sandwich 2,&quot; master William Author, sailed on 6 May 1776 from Portsmouth in a fleet of 100 vessels, 68 of which were transports, which was under orders to support Howe&#x27;s campaign to capture New York. &quot;Lord Sandwich 2&quot; carried 206 men mainly from the Hessian du Corps regiment of Hessian mercenaries. The crossing was stormy, with two Hessians who were in the same fleet making accounts of the voyage. The scattered fleet assembled at Halifax then sailed to Sandy Hook where other ships and troops assembled. On 15 August 1776 &quot;Lord Sandwich 2&quot; was anchored at Sandy Hook; also assembled there was &quot;Adventure&quot;, which had sailed with &quot;Resolution&quot; on Cook&#x27;s second voyage, now a storeship, captained by John Hallum. Another ship there at that time was HMS &quot;Siren&quot;, captained by Tobias Furneaux, who had commanded &quot;Adventure&quot; on Cook&#x27;s second voyage.

New York was eventually captured, but Newport, Rhode Island, remained in the hands of the Americans and posed a threat as a base for recapturing New York, so in November 1776 a fleet, which included &quot;Lord Sandwich 2&quot; carrying Hessian troops, set out to take Rhode Island. The island was taken but not subdued, and &quot;Lord Sandwich 2&quot; was needed as a prison ship.

==Final resting place==

The surrender of British General John Burgoyne&#x27;s army at Saratoga brought France into the war, and in the summer of 1778 a pincer plan was agreed to recapture Newport: the Continental Army would approach overland, and a French fleet would sail into the harbour. To prevent the latter the British commander, Captain John Brisbane, determined to blockade the bay by sinking surplus vessels at its mouth. Between 3 and 6 August a fleet of Royal Navy and hired craft, including &quot;Lord Sandwich 2&quot;, were scuttled at various locations in the Bay. &quot;Lord Sandwich&quot; &quot;2&quot;, previously &quot;Endeavour&quot;, previously &quot;Earl of Pembroke&quot;, was sunk on 4 August 1778.

The owners of the sunken vessels were compensated by the British government for the loss of their ships. The Admiralty valuation for 10 of the sunken vessels recorded that many had been built in Yorkshire, and the details of the &quot;Lord Sandwich&quot; transport matched those of the former &quot;Endeavour&quot; including construction in Whitby, a burthen of  tons, and re-entry into Navy service on 10 February 1776.

In 1834 a letter appeared in the &quot;Providence Journal&quot; of Rhode Island, drawing attention to the possible presence of the former &quot;Endeavour&quot; on the seabed of the bay. This was swiftly disputed by the British consul in Rhode Island, who wrote claiming that &quot;Endeavour&quot; had been bought from Mather by the French in 1790 and renamed &quot;Liberté&quot;. The consul later admitted he had heard this not from the Admiralty, but as hearsay from the former owners of the French ship. It was later suggested &quot;Liberté&quot;, which sank off Newport in 1793, was in fact another of Cook&#x27;s ships, the former HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;, or another &quot;Endeavour&quot;, a naval schooner sold out of service in 1782. A further letter to the &quot;Providence Journal&quot; stated that a retired English sailor was conducting guided tours of a hulk on the River Thames as late as 1825, claiming that the ship had once been Cook&#x27;s &quot;Endeavour.&quot;

In 1991 the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) began research into the identity of the thirteen transports sunk as part of the Newport blockade of 1778, including &quot;Lord Sandwich.&quot; In 1999 RIMAP discovered documents in the Public Record Office (now called the National Archives) in London confirming that &quot;Endeavour&quot; had been renamed &quot;Lord Sandwich&quot;, had served as a troop transport to North America, and had been scuttled at Newport as part of the 1778 fleet of transports.

In 1999, a combined research team from RIMAP and the Australian National Maritime Museum examined some known wrecks in the harbour and in 2000, RIMAP and the ANMM examined a site that appears to be one of the blockade vessels, partly covered by a separate wreck of a 20th-century barge. The older remains were those of a wooden vessel of approximately the same size, and possibly a similar design and materials as &quot;Lord Sandwich&quot; ex &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Confirmation that Cook&#x27;s former ship had indeed been in Newport Harbor sparked public interest in locating her wreck. However, further mapping showed eight other 18th-century wrecks in Newport Harbor, some with features and conditions also consistent with &quot;Endeavour&quot;. In 2006 RIMAP announced that the wrecks were unlikely to be raised. In 2016 RIMAP concluded that there was a probability of 80 to 100% that the wreck of &quot;Endeavour&quot; was still in Newport Harbor, probably one of a cluster of five wrecks on the seafloor, and planned to investigate the ships and their artifacts further. They were seeking funds to build facilities for handling and storing recovered objects.

In September 2018, Fairfax Media reported that archaeologists from RIMAP had pinpointed the final resting place of the vessel. The possible discovery was hailed as a &quot;hugely significant moment&quot; in Australian history, but researchers have warned they were yet to &quot;definitively&quot; confirm whether the wreck had been located.

On 3 February 2022, the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) held an event attended by federal cabinet minister Paul Fletcher to announce that the wreck had been confirmed to be that of the &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The RIMAP has called the announcement &quot;premature&quot; and a &quot;breach of contract&quot;, which the ANMM denies. The RIMAP&#x27;s lead investigator stated that &quot;there has been no indisputable data found to prove the site is that iconic vessel, and there are many unanswered questions that could overturn such an identification&quot;. In November 2023, however, the ANMM announced further confirmative discoveries. Meanwhile, the wreck is being eaten by shipworms.

==&quot;Endeavour&quot; relics and legacy==
In addition to the search for the remains of the ship herself, there was substantial Australian interest in locating relics of the ship&#x27;s south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men&#x27;s Progress Association of Cooktown sought to recover the six cannon thrown overboard when &quot;Endeavour&quot; grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed. Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an &quot;Endeavour&quot; cannon from shallow water near the Reef.

In 1937, a small part of &quot;Endeavour&quot; keel was given to the Australian Government by philanthropist Charles Wakefield in his capacity as president of the Admiral Arthur Phillip Memorial. Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons described the section of keel as &quot;intimately associated with the discovery and foundation of Australia&quot;.

Searches were resumed for the lost Endeavour Reef cannon, but expeditions in 1966, 1967, and 1968 were unsuccessful. They were finally recovered in 1969 by a research team from the American Academy of Natural Sciences, using a sophisticated magnetometer to locate the cannon, a quantity of iron ballast but not the abandoned bower anchor. Conservation work on the cannon was undertaken by the Australian National Maritime Museum, after which two of the cannon were displayed at its headquarters in Sydney&#x27;s Darling Harbour, and eventually put on display at Botany Bay and the National Museum of Australia in Canberra (with a replica remaining at the museum). A third cannon, and the bower anchor recovered in 1971, were displayed at the James Cook Museum in Cooktown, with the remaining three at the National Maritime Museum in London, the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington.

&quot;Endeavour&quot;″s Pacific voyage was further commemorated in the use of her image on the reverse of the New Zealand fifty-cent coin.

Apollo 15&#x27;s command and service module CSM-112 was given the call sign &quot;Endeavour&quot;; astronaut David Scott explained the choice of the name on the grounds that its captain, Cook, had commanded the first purely scientific sea voyage, and Apollo 15 was the first lunar landing mission on which there was a heavy emphasis on science. Apollo 15 took with it a small piece of wood claimed to be from Cook&#x27;s ship. The ship was again commemorated in the naming of the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; in 1989. The shuttle&#x27;s name in turn inspired the naming of the SpaceX Crew Dragon &quot;Endeavour&quot;, the first such capsule to launch crew.

==Replica vessels==

In January 1988, to commemorate the Australian Bicentenary of European settlement in Australia, work began in Fremantle, Western Australia, on a replica of &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Financial difficulties delayed completion until December 1993, and the vessel was not commissioned until April 1994. The replica vessel commenced her maiden voyage in October of that year, sailing to Sydney Harbour and then following Cook&#x27;s path from Botany Bay northward to Cooktown. From 1996 to 2002, the replica retraced Cook&#x27;s ports of call around the world, arriving in the original &quot;Endeavour&quot; home port of Whitby in May 1997 and June 2002. Footage of waves shot while rounding Cape Horn on this voyage was later used in digitally composited scenes in the 2003 film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;.

The replica &quot;Endeavour&quot; visited various European ports before undertaking her final ocean voyage from Whitehaven to Sydney Harbour on 8 November 2004. Her arrival in Sydney was delayed when she ran aground in Botany Bay, a short distance from the point where Cook first set foot in Australia 235 years earlier. The replica &quot;Endeavour&quot; finally entered Sydney Harbour on 17 April 2005, having travelled , including twice around the world. Ownership of the replica was transferred to the Australian National Maritime Museum in 2005 for permanent service as a museum ship in Sydney&#x27;s Darling Harbour.

A second full-size replica of &quot;Endeavour&quot; was berthed on the River Tees in Stockton-on-Tees before being moved to Whitby. While it reflects the external dimensions of Cook&#x27;s vessel, this replica was constructed with a steel rather than a timber frame, has one less internal deck than the original, and is not designed to go to sea.

The Russell Museum, in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, has a sailing one-fifth scale replica of &quot;Endeavour&quot;. It was built in Auckland in 1969 and travelled by trailer throughout New Zealand and Australia before being presented to the museum in 1970.

At Whitby the &quot;Bark Endeavour Whitby&quot; is a scaled-down replica of the original ship. It relies on engines for propulsion and is a little less than half the size of the original. Trips for tourists take them along the coast to Sandsend.

A replica of the ship is displayed in the Cleveland Centre, Middlesbrough, England.

<doc id="183660" wikidata="Q6981536" url="?curid=183660" title="Nauvoo Expositor">
<text>The Nauvoo Expositor was a newspaper in Nauvoo, Illinois, United States, that published only one issue. Its publication, and the destruction of the printing press ordered by Mayor Joseph Smith and the city council, set off a chain of events that led to Smith&#x27;s arrest for treason and subsequent killing at the hands of a lynch mob.

Smith, leader of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, had a practice of secretly marrying his followers, including other men&#x27;s wives. Smith is estimated to have married nearly fifty wives. While promoting polygamy in private, Smith publicly denied the practice of polygamy. In response, a handful of high-ranking church leaders denounced Smith as a fallen prophet, founded a reformed church, and announced plans to publish a newspaper—acts that resulted in their excommunication from Smith&#x27;s church. Based on their testimony, Smith was indicted on state criminal charges of perjury and &quot;fornication and adultery&quot;.

The &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;, published on June 7, 1844, exposed Smith&#x27;s practice of polygamy and accused him of promoting polytheism by teaching that church members can become gods. Smith and the Nauvoo City Council declared the paper a public nuisance and ordered the press to be destroyed. The town marshal carried out the order during the evening of June 10. Smith and other members of the council were charged with inciting a riot; after an arrest warrant was issued for Smith, he declared martial law and mobilized the city militia, the Nauvoo Legion of which he was the commander-in-chief holding the rank of Lieutenant General. In response, Governor Ford raised a militia, peacefully entering Nauvoo to search for Joseph Smith, who had fled the state.

On June 25, after he received guarantees of safety, Smith surrendered on the riot charges expecting to be freed on bail. Once in Carthage, Smith was also charged with treason against Illinois for declaring martial law. Treason, a capital crime, was not a bailable offense. Smith, Hyrum, and other leaders were incarcerated in the Carthage Jail, guarded by only seven men. Though expecting to be rescued by his followers, Smith and Hyrum were killed by a lynch mob on June 27.

==Background==
In 1830, Joseph Smith, age 24, published the Book of Mormon, which he described as an English translation of ancient golden plates he received from an angel. The same year he organized the Church of Christ, calling it a restoration of the early Christian Church. Members of the church were later called &quot;Latter Day Saints&quot; or &quot;Mormons&quot;. Smith and his followers sought to assemble together in a theocratic community under Smith&#x27;s leadership, or &#x27;Zion&#x27;, first in Kirtland, Ohio and later in Independence, Missouri.

In 1833, a mob of settlers attacked a Mormon newspaper&#x27;s printing office, destroyed the press, and tarred and feathered two Mormon leaders. Mormons were driven from Jackson county. After losing the 1838 Mormon War, Smith was jailed and his followers were forced out of Missouri.

After Smith escaped custody, he fled to Illinois, where he founded a new settlement that he named Nauvoo. After the Nauvoo City Charter passed both houses of the state legislature, Illinois governor Thomas Carlin signed it into law on December 16, 1849. The charter allowed the Nauvoo city council to pass laws &#x27;not in conflict with the state and federal constitutions&#x27;; Chicago and Alton charters had similar provisions. The charter also empowered the Nauvoo Municipal Court to issue writs of habeas corpus. The power would later enable Joseph Smith to elude authorities from Missouri, where he was wanted on charges of treason. Nauvoo was not the only city with such a power; in 1839, Alton had been granted the same power to issue habeas corpus writs.

William Law, a wealthy immigrant from Ireland, and his wife had joined the Church of Christ in 1836 in Canada. In 1839, Law led a group of Canadian LDS members to Nauvoo. In 1841, Joseph Smith chose him to be a member of the First Presidency. He was also a member of the Nauvoo city council.

Francis M. Higbee had joined the church in 1832. In the aftermath of the 1838 Mormon War, Francis Higbee was arraigned along with Smith, in Richmond, Missouri on November 11, 1838. He was released 18 days later. On June 30, 1842, Francis Higbee gave a sworn statement that &quot;Joseph Smith told [him] that John C. Bennett could be easily put aside or drowned, and no person would be the wiser for it&quot;. On January 15, 1844, the Nauvoo Municipal Court issued a warrant for Higbee&#x27;s arrest on the affidavit of Orson Pratt. Chauncey Higbee had also joined the church in 1832. In November 1841, he had been appointed aide-de-camp to Major General John C. Bennett of the Nauvoo Legion.

==Origins==

Although he had been married since 1827 and polygamy was criminal, Smith had been secretly marrying his followers and faced accusations of adultery.

On July 17, 1831, Smith dictated a revelation that &quot;foreshadowed&quot; the practice of plural wives. On December 8, former member Ezra Booth publicly alleged that a married member of the church, though fearful of civil authorities, espoused his religious liberty to take a second wife. On March 24, 1832, an Ohio mob stripped Smith naked with an eye to castrate him, but the doctor refused to carry out the procedure at the last minute; some suggest this incident may have stemmed from intimacies with a girl or woman not his wife. In January 1838, original Book of Mormon witness Oliver Cowdery was excommunicated, in part because he &quot;seemed to insinuate&quot; that Smith was guilty of adultery.

In 1842, after church leader and Nauvoo mayor John C. Bennett was excommunicated for adultery, Bennett published a book-length exposé revealing Smith&#x27;s own practice of polygamy. On August 31, a broadsheet was published featuring affidavits defending Joseph Smith from Bennett&#x27;s charges; among his defenders were William Law, his brother Wilson Law, Francis Higbee and his brother Chauncey Higbee.

In public, Joseph Smith repeatedly denied adultery and polygamy throughout his lifetime. In 2014, the Church admitted Smith had married about 40 of his female followers, including a 14-year-old and others who were already married.

===Other men&#x27;s wives===
Joseph Smith ultimately married at least eleven women who were already married, and made proposals to others.

On June 1, 1843, Austin Cowles&#x27;s daughter Elvira, recently wed to another man, had married Joseph Smith. On September 12, Cowles resigned his seat in the high council. Afterwards, Cowles &quot;was far more outspoken and energetic in his opposition to polygamy than almost any other man in Nauvoo.&quot; On July 12, 1843, Joseph Smith dictated a revelation about polygamy. Later that day, Joseph and Hyrum presented it to Joseph&#x27;s first wife Emma, who rejected it. On August 12, 1843, Hyrum Smith read Smith&#x27;s revelation concerning plural marriage to the Nauvoo High Council. On November 5, Smith became sick and was suspected of having been poisoned, perhaps by wife Emma.

Joseph Smith made several proposals to William Law&#x27;s wife Jane, under the premise that she would enter a polyandrous marriage with Smith. Law&#x27;s wife later described Smith&#x27;s proposals, saying that Smith had &quot;asked her to give him half her love; she was at liberty to keep the other half for her husband.&quot; Upon learning of the proposal, Law threatened to expose Smith unless he went before the High Council to confess and repent. On January 8, 1844, Smith removed Law from the First Presidency. On February 1, the &quot;Times and Season&quot; announced that Hiram Brown had been excommunicated for preaching polygamy in Michigan.

In early 1844, Dr. Robert D. Foster returned home to find his wife being visited by Joseph Smith. She later confessed that Smith had preached polygamy and attempted to seduce her.

In March 1844, Emma organized a series of meetings, and publicly denounced polygamy as evil and destructive; though she did not directly disclose Smith&#x27;s secret practice of plural marriage, she insisted that people should heed only what he taught publicly—implicitly challenging his private promulgation of polygamy.

===Key Stone Store meeting===
In mid-March 1844, Joseph Jackson attempted to recruit two Nauvoo men, Marenus G. Eaton and Abiathar Williams, with stories about &quot;men tied hand and foot and runthrough the heart with a sword, and there heads taken off, and then buried.&quot; The pair attended a meeting in the back room of a grocery store; in attendance were the Laws, the Higbees, and Robert D. Foster.

At the meeting, Robert Foster told about Joseph Smith&#x27;s attempt to seduce Robert&#x27;s wife. Chauncey Higbee confirmed the practice of polygamy among Smith and other church leaders. Jackson suggested he had knowledge of a conspiracy to kill the Smiths.

Eaton and Williams reported the events of the meeting to Joseph Smith. On March 24, Joseph Smith told his congregation that a group planned to &quot;destroy all the Smith family in a few weeks&quot;, naming the members as: Chauncey Higbee, Robert Foster, Joseph Jackson, and William and Wilson Law.

===General conference and exaltation===
On April 6, Law notified Smith and some members of the Twelve that he desired an investigation before the Church General Conference.

On April 7, Smith addressed the Church&#x27;s annual general conference in Nauvoo in a speech known as the King Follett sermon (named for a Mormon who had recently died in an accident). Smith reported he was &quot;never in any nearer relationship to God than at the present time&quot;. Smith elaborated, saying he wanted to &quot;refute the idea that God was God from all eternity&quot;. Smith explain that God was &quot;once was a man like us&quot;. He advised followers that &quot;You have got to learn how to make yourselves God, king and priest, by going from a small capacity to a great capacity to the resurrection of the dead to dwelling in everlasting burnings.&quot;

William Law later reported that the conference featured &quot;some of the most blasphemous doctrines... ever heard of,&quot; such as &quot;other gods as far above our God as he is above us.&quot;

===Continued strife===
On April 13, Smith questioned Robert Foster in Municipal Court. When Foster declined to testify, Joseph brought charges against him &quot;for abusing my character privately, for throwing out slanderous insinuation against me, for conspiring against my peace and Safety, for conspiring against my life, for conspiring against the peace of my family.&quot;

Sworn statements by the witnesses to the Key Stone Store were published in the &quot;Nauvoo Neighbor&quot; on April 17.

On April 18, four dissenters were excommunicated from the church: William Law, his wife Jane, his brother William, and Robert D. Foster; contrary to standard protocol in Church courts, they were given no opportunity to defend themselves or bring witnesses, nor were the defendants present at their church trial. Also excommunicated was Howard Smith. Joseph charged Foster with &quot;immorality and apostasy&quot;, character defamation, lying, and endangering his life in the Nauvoo High Council.
Decades later, Law recalled having been invited to a &#x27;reconciliation dinner&#x27; but declining amid fears of poisoning.

===Expositor announced===
On April 28, the anti-polygamist dissenters held a meeting. William Law and Charles Ivins were variously reportedly to have been named to leadership.

On May 1, Francis M. Higbee filed a legal complaint in the Fifth Judicial District of Illinois, suing Smith for slander and requesting damages of five thousand dollars. On May 4, William Law, his wife Jane, and Austin Cowles appeared before a Justice of the Peace and gave a sworn statement about Smith&#x27;s polygamy. On May 7, Charles Ivin, in association with the Laws, Higgbees, and Fosters, set up a print shop in Nauvoo On May 8, the Warsaw Signal reported a new church had been organized under the leadership of William Law, who preached that Joseph Smith was a fallen prophet; the &quot;Signal&quot; reported that a press had been obtained and a paper would soon be published. On May 10, a newspaper prospectus was circulated, announcing the creation of the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;. The &quot;Expositor&quot; was planned as an exposé of church practices which Law and his associates opposed.

On May 15, the &quot;Signal&quot; reported Law had preached to an audience of 300, while other speakers included Francis Higbee and James Blakesley. On May 18, the church excommunicated Francis M. Higbee, Blakesley, Charles Ivins, and Austin Cowles for apostasy.

===Criminal indictment of Joseph Smith===
On May 23, a grand jury from the Hancock County Circuit Court issued a criminal indictment against Smith on the charges of perjury based on the statements of Joseph Jackson and Robert Foster. A second indictment, for &quot;fornication and adultery&quot;, was issued based on the statements of William and Wilson Law who swore Smith had been living with Maria Lawrence &quot;in an open state of adultery&quot; since the prior October 12.

On May 26, Smith again denied polygamy, preaching: &quot;What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing adultery, and having seven wives, when I can only find one. I am the same man, and as innocent as I was fourteen years ago; and I can prove them all perjurers.&quot; On May 29, 1844, the church&#x27;s high council ordered the publication of testimony and affidavits which purported to be accounts of Chauncey Higbee&#x27;s trial before the high council two years earlier. According to the documents, Chauncey Higbee had been accused of &quot;adulterous sins&quot; and tried on May 24, 1842. Included were statements from women claiming he had committed adultery by telling them that Joseph Smith secretly preached the practice of polygamy. In response, Chauncey Higbee was excommunicated from the church.

==Contents==
The only issue of the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;, dated June 7, 1844, was a four-page publication. In addition to more mundane content such as poetry and marriage announcements, it contained a statement from the &quot;Seceders from the Church at Nauvoo&quot; and sworn statements from multiple individuals attesting to the teaching of &quot;the plurality of wives&quot;.

===Prospectus from publishers===
In their prospectus, the publishers advocate for major reforms including the repeal of the Nauvoo City Charter. They vow to &quot;decry moral imperfections&quot; wherever found, &quot;whether in the Plebeian, Patrician, or self-constituted monarch&quot;.

===Statement from seceders===
The preamble establishes that despite the schism, the authors maintain their belief in &quot;the religion of the Latter Day Saints, as originally taught by Joseph Smith&quot;.

The statement discusses the schism, attributed to &quot;many items of doctrine, as now taught, some of which, however, are taught secretly, and denied openly&quot; which they declare &quot;heretical and damnable&quot;. They cite the practice of plural marriage, accusing Smith and other church leaders of using their ecclesiastical position to coerce recently arrived female converts into becoming Smith&#x27;s &quot;spiritual wi[ves]&quot;. They also cite the &quot;false doctrine of many Gods&quot;, saying &quot;[i]t is contended that there are innumerable Gods as much above the God that presides over this universe, as he is above us; and if he varies from the law unto which he is subjected, he, with all his creatures, will be cast down as was Lucifer&quot;. The statement criticizes the process behind the recent excommunication, writing &quot;Smith has established an inquisition&quot;—a process they &quot;contend is contrary to the book of Doctrine and Covenants, for our law condemnest no man until he is heard&quot;.

The statement suggests that their struggle will be on-going, writing: &quot;We most solemnly and sincerely declare that the sword of truth shall not depart from the thigh, nor the buckler from the arm, until we can enjoy those glorious privileges which nature&#x27;s God and our country&#x27;s laws have guarantied to us—freedom of speech, the liberty of the press, and the right to worship God as seemeth us good.&quot; The authors resolve not to &quot;acknowledge any man as king or law-giver to the church&quot; and vow to oppose &quot;every attempt to unite church and state&quot;. They accuse Smith and other church officials of introducing &quot;false and damnable doctrines into the Church, such as a plurality of Gods above the God of this universe, and his liability to fall with all his creations; the plurality of wives, for time and eternity, the doctrine of unconditional sealing up to eternal life, against all crimes except that of shedding innocent blood&quot;.

===Affidavits===

The &quot;Expositor&quot; contained affidavits alleging the teaching of a revelation from Smith which &quot;authorized certain men to have more wives than one at a time&quot;. Statements were made by William Law, his wife Jane, and Austin Cowles.

==Reception and destruction==

Smith called a meeting of the City Council, where &quot;he proceeded to put the &quot;Expositor&quot; and its editors on trial, as if that body was of a judicial instead of a legislative character.&quot; The trial &quot;lasted all of Saturday, June 8, and a part of Monday, June 10&quot;.

After the city council declared the &quot;Expositor&quot; a public nuisance, Smith issued two orders for the &quot;Expositor&quot;&#x27;s destruction. City Marshall John P. Greene, accompanied by a hundred-man posse, carried out the destruction.

==Aftermath of the destruction of the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;==
Seeking relief from the state courts, Francis M. Higbee, one of the &quot;Expositor&quot;s publishers, gave a sworn statement about the events of June10. Non-Mormons in Hancock County were infuriated when they heard of the news of the destruction of the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;, believing that it was an example of Mormon disregard for their laws. Many of them, including the neighboring newspapers &quot;Quincy Whig&quot; and &quot;Warsaw Signal&quot;, called for the arrest of the Mormon leaders. On June12, the Hancock County Justice of the Peace issued a warrant for the arrest of Smith and 17 other named individuals under the jurisdiction of the Hancock County Court.

===First arrest attempt===

Constable David Bettisworth was tasked with arresting Smith and conveying him to the Hancock County Court. On June12, Bettisworth served Smith with the warrant. Rather than return with Bettisworth to the Hancock County Court, Smith instead petitioned the Municipal Court of Nauvoo to dismiss the charges.

On June12, a hearing was held in the Municipal Court of Nauvoo. The Court dismissed the charges against Smith. The following day, Smith presided over the Municipal Court of Nauvoo when it dismissed the charges against the others named in the Hancock County Court warrant. Unable to compel Smith to return, Bettisworth left Nauvoo without Smith or any of the others named in the arrest warrant.

On June13, citizens of Hancock County gathered in the county seat for a mass-meeting in response to the destruction of the &quot;Expositor&quot;. The meeting resolved to seek help from the Governor, writing: 
And WHEREAS, Hiram Smith did in presence of the City Council, and the citizens of Nauvoo, offer a reward for the destruction of the printing press and materials of the Warsaw Signal, -- a newspaper also opposed to his interest. ... And.. WHEREAS, Hiram Smith has within the last week publicly threatened the life of one of our valued citizens -- Thos. C. Sharp, the editor of the Signal... 
Whereas said Smith and others refuse to obey the mandate of said writ; and whereas in the opinion of this meeting, it is impossible for said officer so raise a posse of sufficient strength to execute said writ;... it is the opinion of this meeting that the circumstances of the case require the interposition of executive power. Therefore, 
Resolved, that a deputation of two discreet men be sent to Springfield to solicit such interposition. 

On June 14, the &quot;Signal&quot; published reports that Hyrum Smith had called the &quot;Signal&quot; press also libelous and issued a reward for its destruction.
The following day, the &quot;Warsaw Signal&quot; published the resolutions, editorializing that &quot;[r]epeated attempts have been made to arrest Smith, but he has been uniformly screened from the officers of Justice, by the aid of the Municipal Court [of Nauvoo], which is the tool and echo of himself.&quot;

On June14, Smith defended the destruction of the &quot;Expositor&quot; to Governor Thomas Ford, writing:

In the investigation it appeared evident to the council that the proprietors were a set of unprincipled men, lawless, debouchees, counterfeiters, Bogus Makers, gamblers, peace disturbers, and that the grand object of said proprietors was to destroy our constitutional rights and chartered privileges; to overthrow all good and wholesome regulations in society; to strengthen themselves against the municipality; to fortify themselves against the church of which I am a member, and destroy all our religious rights and privileges, by libels, slanders, falsehoods, perjury &amp; sticking at no corruption to accomplish their hellish purposes. and that said paper of itself was libelous of the deepest dye, and very injurious as a vehicle of defamation,—tending to corrupt the morals, and disturb the peace, tranquillity and happiness of the whole community, and especially that of Nauvoo.
===Martial law in Nauvoo===
Smith declared martial law on June18 and called out the Nauvoo Legion, an organized city militia of about 5,000 men. On June 20, the &quot;Warsaw Signal&quot; reported that recent travelers had been told they could not leave the city without a pass.

On June21, Governor Ford arrived at the Hancock County seat in Carthage. On June 21, Joseph H. Jackson swore two affidavits about recent events in Nauvoo. On June22, Ford wrote to the mayor and city council of Nauvoo:
I now express to you my opinion that your conduct in the destruction of the press was a very gross outrage upon the laws and the liberties of the people. It may have been full of libels, but this did not authorize you to destroy it.
There are many newspapers in this state which have been wrongfully abusing me for more than a year, and yet such is my regard for the liberty of the press and the rights of a free people in a republican government that I would shed the last drop of my blood to protect those presses from any illegal violence. 
The owners of the press obtained... a warrant against the authors of this destruction for a riot; 
They [the Defendants] have ever since refused to be arrested or to submit to a trial at any other place or before any other court, except in the city and before the Municipal Court [of Nauvoo].
Smith fled the jurisdiction to avoid arrest, crossing the Mississippi River into Iowa. On June23, a posse under the command of the governor entered Nauvoo to execute an arrest warrant, but they were unable to locate Smith.

===Surrender and killing of the Smiths===

On June25, 1844, Joseph and Hyrum Smith, along with the other fifteen co-defendants, surrendered to Bettisworth on the original charge of inciting a riot. An arraignment was held on the rioting charge and Justice Robert F. Smith granted bail of $500 for each of the defendants.

After the defendants were granted bail on the riot charge, Justice R.F. Smith heard testimony from Augustine Spencer and issued a writ for the arrest of Joseph and Hyrum Smith on the charge of treason against Illinois. The Smiths were placed under arrest and transported to Carthage Jail.

Early on June 27, Smith authored an order to Nauvoo Legion commander Jonathan Dunham instructing him to bring the Legion to Carthage and stage a jailbreak. Smith and the other prisoners were guarded only by six members of the Carthage Grays, led by Sgt. Frank Worrell.

A division of militia began marching away from Carthage, but soon received orders to disband. Learning that the Governor had dismissed the troops, a group from Warsaw set out to Carthage to see the Governor. En route, a messenger informed the group that the Governor had gone to Nauvoo and &quot;there is nobody in Carthage [that] you can [depend on]&quot;. When the group approached the building, jailers became alarmed, but Smith, mistaking the mob for the Nauvoo Legion, told a jailer: &quot;Don&#x27;t trouble yourself ... they&#x27;ve come to rescue me.&quot; The mob attacked the jail and killed both Joseph and Hyrum Smith; John Taylor was wounded in the attack.

===Succession===

Sometime between June 23 and June 27, 1844, Smith reportedly stated that &quot;if he and Hyrum were taken away, Samuel H. Smith would be his successor&quot;. In a meeting on July 10, 1844, Samuel H. Smith reminded the group that he was Joseph&#x27;s designee as president if both Joseph and Hyrum had died. Samuel died on July 30; Smith&#x27;s brother, William, later stated that he had good reason to believe that Smith was poisoned by Hosea Stout on orders from Brigham Young and Willard Richards. Hosea Stout was suspected in part because, as reported by Smith&#x27;s wife, Stout had been administering a white powder to Smith daily as treatment for his illness. Smith&#x27;s sole remaining brother, William Smith, later argued Samuel had been poisoned. On October 6, 1845, William Smith was removed from the offices of apostle and patriarch, and was disfellowshipped. He was excommunicated on October 19.

===Murder trial===

Five individuals were indicted for Smith&#x27;s death: Thomas C. Sharp, publisher of the Warsaw Signal; Levi Williams, commander of 59th Regiment of the Illinois militia; Mark Aldrich, commander of the Warsaw Independent Battalion; William N. Grover, captain of the Warsaw Rifle Company; and Jacob C. Davis, commander of the Warsaw Cadets. All were acquitted.

===Repeal of Nauvoo Charter and Exodus===
At the next session of the Illinois state legislature the following December, the Nauvoo Charter was repealed by a vote of 25–14 in the Senate and 75–31 in the House. This disincorporated the City of Nauvoo and dissolved its municipal institutions. Nauvoo municipal assets were court-ordered to be placed in receivership.

The winter of 1845–46 saw the enormous preparations for the Mormon Exodus via the Mormon Trail. In early 1846, the majority of the Latter Day Saints left the city.

==Mormon views==

While most scholars agree that the destruction of the press was illegal, some Mormons have defended the destruction of the &quot;Expositor&quot; by Smith and the council, while other Mormons view the destruction as illegal.

In her 1945 biography of Smith, &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot;, dissident Mormon historian Fawn Brodie described the destruction of the press as a &quot;violation of the holy Constitution&quot;, opining that &quot;It was a greater breach of political and legal discipline than the anti-Mormons could have hoped for.&quot; The following year, Brodie was excommunicated. In his 2005 book, historian Richard Bushman called Brodie &quot;the most imminent of Smith&#x27;s unbelieving biographers&quot;.

In 1963, Dallin H. Oaks, after serving as stake mission president in Chicago, was called as Second Counselor in the Stake Presidency. In 1965, Oaks, then a law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, published an article in the &quot;Utah Law Review&quot; in which he argued that while the destruction of the &quot;Expositor&quot;&#x27;s printing press was legally questionable, under the law of the time the newspaper could have been declared libelous and therefore a public nuisance by the Nauvoo City Council. Oaks concludes it would have been legally permissible under the common law of the time for city officials to destroy, or &quot;abate&quot;, the actual printed newspapers. However, he notes that there &quot;was no legal justification in 1844 for the destruction of the &quot;Expositor&quot; press as a nuisance&quot; and that its owners could have sued for damages; Oaks was president of Brigham Young University until 1980, when he was appointed to the Utah Supreme Court. In 1984, he resigned from the Court to be &quot;called&quot; to high levels of LDS Church leadership, as a member of both the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and, later, First Presidency. The official church website cites the opinion of Oaks, asserting that &quot;The Nauvoo City Council had reason to believe their actions were legal.&quot;

Other Mormon legal scholars, such as Edwin Firmage and R. Collin Mangrum, similarly concluded that &quot;Whether or not the suppression of the &quot;Expositor&quot; was justified, such action may have exceeded the council&#x27;s authority.&quot;

Grant H. Palmer was a Mormon historian who authored the 2002 book &quot;An Insider&#x27;s View of Mormon Origins&quot;; he was disfellowshipped two years later. After resigning in 2010, Palmer published an article on William Law in which he opined that Law was &quot;the most credible and important person to have ever left the First Presidency&quot;. Palmer argues that William and Jane Law opposed Joseph Smith because he ordered the death of his enemies, married other men&#x27;s wives, and sought to establish a kingdom within the United States.

<text>Dallin Harris Oaks (born August 12, 1932) is an American religious leader and former jurist and academic who since 2018 has been the first counselor in the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was called as a member of the church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1984. Currently, he is the second most senior apostle by years of service and is the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

Oaks was born and raised in Provo, Utah. He studied accounting at Brigham Young University (BYU), then went to law school at the University of Chicago, where he was editor-in-chief of the &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot; and graduated in 1957 with a J.D. &quot;cum laude&quot;. Oaks was a law clerk for Chief Justice Earl Warren of the U.S. Supreme Court, then spent three years in private practice at Kirkland &amp; Ellis before returning to the University of Chicago as a professor of law in 1961. He taught at Chicago until 1971, when he was chosen to succeed Ernest L. Wilkinson as the president of BYU. Oaks was BYU&#x27;s president from 1971 until 1980. Oaks was then appointed to the Utah Supreme Court, serving until his selection to the LDS Church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1984.

During his professional career, Oaks was twice considered by the U.S. president for nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court: first in 1975 by Gerald Ford, who ultimately nominated John Paul Stevens, and again in 1981 by Ronald Reagan, who ultimately nominated Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor.

==Background==
Dallin Oaks was born on August 12, 1932, in Provo, Utah, to Stella (&quot;née&quot; Harris) and Lloyd E. Oaks. Through his mother, he is a 2nd great grandnephew of one of the three witnesses to the Book of Mormon, Martin Harris. He was given the name Dallin in honor of Utah artist Cyrus Dallin. His mother was the artist&#x27;s model for &quot;The Pioneer Mother&quot;, a public statue in Springville, Utah. She was present for the unveiling of the statue less than three weeks before Dallin Oaks was born.

==Early life==
When Oaks was two years old, his father moved the family from Provo to Twin Falls, Idaho, where they lived until Oaks was eight. Oaks began his schooling at Washington School in Twin Falls. His father died of tuberculosis in 1940.

After the death of her husband, Stella Oaks suffered an episode of mental illness and was unable to attend school and work for a time. During this time, Oaks and his two younger siblings resided with their maternal grandparents in Payson, Utah. The loss of his father and the temporary loss of his mother caused him to have difficulties concentrating in school. When he was about nine or ten years old, he resumed living with his mother, who had taken a position as a teacher in Vernal, Utah.

Both of his parents were graduates of BYU. After his father died, his mother pursued a graduate degree at Columbia University and later served as head of adult education for the Provo School District. In 1956, she became the first woman to sit on the Provo City Council, where she served for two terms. In 1958, she also briefly served as Provo&#x27;s assistant mayor.

From about age 10 to 16 Oaks and his younger brother and sister spent the school year in Vernal, Utah, and the summer in Payson, Utah, with his maternal grandparents while his mother pursued her graduate degree at Columbia. During these years his mother was a high school teacher in Vernal. Oaks obtained his first job at the age of twelve at a radio repair shop in Vernal sweeping the floors. He later worked as an engineer and announcer for stations in both Vernal (KJAM) and Provo (KCSU). He had obtained his first-class radio operator license in the spring of 1948.

During his first two years of high school Oaks attended Uintah High School in Vernal, where he was on the football team, involved in debate, and played the oboe in the school band. At the start of his 11th-grade year, the Oaks family moved to Provo, where he chose to attend Brigham Young High School (B Y High) because it was smaller than Provo High School. At B Y High, he was again involved in football, track, playing the oboe in the band, and dramatic productions. Oaks graduated from B Y High in 1950.

Oaks was involved in Boy Scouts and earned the rank of Eagle Scout at age 14.

==Education==
After high school, Oaks attended BYU, where he occasionally served as a radio announcer at high school basketball games. At one of these basketball games during his freshman year at BYU, he met June Dixon, a senior at the high school, whom he married during his junior year at BYU. Due to his membership in the Utah National Guard and the possibility of being called up to serve in the Korean War, Oaks did not serve as an LDS Church missionary. In 1952, Oaks married Dixon in the Salt Lake Temple. He graduated from BYU in 1954 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in accounting with high honors.

Oaks then attended the University of Chicago Law School on a full-tuition National Honor Scholarship, where he served as editor-in-chief of the &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot;. He graduated in 1957 with a Juris Doctor, &quot;cum laude&quot;.

==Career==
After graduating from law school in 1957, Oaks spent a year as a law clerk to chief justice Earl Warren of the U.S. Supreme Court. After his clerkship, he entered private practice at the law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis, where he specialized in corporate litigation. Oaks had worked with this firm twice before, first during a summer in law school and then for a few months before he began his clerkship with Justice Warren. When Oaks began work at Kirkland &amp; Ellis he worked under Robert Bork but he was quickly appointed as one of the principal lawyers. He mainly worked on cases for clients Standard Oil of Indiana, B. F. Goodrich and Chemetron Corporation, but also assisted with cases with several other companies. Initially they lived fairly far west in the suburbs of Chicago, but in 1960 the Oaks bought a house in Elmhurst, Illinois. According to historian Lavina Fielding Anderson, Oaks was the first lawyer from Kirkland &amp; Ellis to represent an indigent party before the Illinois Supreme Court. This case was also the first time Oaks argued a case before an appellate court.

In 1961, Oaks left Kirkland &amp; Ellis and became a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. During part of his time on the faculty of the Law School, Oaks served as interim dean. During this time, Rex E. Lee was among the students he sought to get placed in Supreme Court clerkships. As a faculty member, Oaks taught primarily in the fields of trust and estate law, as well as gift taxation law. He worked with George Bogert on a new edition of a casebook on trusts. In 1963, Oaks edited a book entitled &quot;The Wall Between Church and State&quot; covering discussions on views on the relationship of the government and religion in the law and the aptness of that metaphor. He also wrote an article on the school prayer cases aimed at a lay audience that was published in the LDS Church&#x27;s &quot;Improvement Era&quot; in December 1963. He also wrote on issues of evidence exclusion and the Fourth Amendment. He was opposed to the exclusionary rule and favored prosecution in &quot;victim-less crimes&quot;. In the summer of 1964, he served as assistant state&#x27;s attorney for Cook County, Illinois. In the fall of 1964, Oaks was appointed a full professor at the University of Chicago law school. While at the University of Chicago, Oaks was the faculty advisor to the legal aid clinic at that institution. He also worked to find ways to address the root issues facing the poor. He felt the federal anti-poverty programs of the time focused too much on symptoms and not enough on causes. Oaks served as a visiting professor at the University of Michigan Law School during the summer of 1968.

In 1968, he became a founding member of the editorial board of &quot;&quot;; he resigned from the journal in early 1970. In 1969, Oaks served as chairman of the University of Chicago disciplinary committee. In conducting hearings against the 160 students who had been involved in a sit-in at the administration building, Oaks was physically attacked twice. Over 100 students were eventually either suspended or expelled. During the first half of 1970, Oaks took a leave of absence from the University of Chicago while serving as legal counsel to the Bill of Rights Committee of the Illinois Constitutional Convention, which caused him to work closely with the committee chair, Elmer Gertz. From 1970 to 1971, Oaks served as the executive director of the American Bar Foundation. Oaks left the University of Chicago Law School when he was appointed the president of BYU in 1971. In 1975, Oaks was one of eleven considered to be nominated for the vacancy in the United States Supreme Court.

Oaks also served five years as chairman of the board of directors of the Public Broadcasting Service (1979–84) and eight years as chairman of the board of directors of the Polynesian Cultural Center. Additionally, over the course of his career, Oaks served as a director of the Union Pacific Corporation and Union Pacific Railroad.

===BYU president===

After the resignation of Ernest L. Wilkinson as BYU&#x27;s 7th president, Neal A. Maxwell, who was the Commissioner of the Church Educational System, created a search committee for a new president, without any good leads on candidates. Both Wilkinson and University of Utah Vice President Jerry R. Anderson recommended to Maxwell that Oaks be interviewed. He was offered the position and assumed his duties on August 1, 1971. From 1971 to 1980, Oaks served as BYU&#x27;s 8th president. Oaks oversaw the start of the J. Reuben Clark Law School and the Graduate Business School. Bruce C. Hafen was the main assistant and point man to Oaks in the process of setting up the law school.

Although university enrollment continued to grow and new buildings were added, neither was done at the pace of the previous administration. Unlike his predecessor, Oaks took a hands-off approach to the discipline of the university students specifically in relation to the Church Educational System Honor Code. He believed that should be delegated to the dean of students. Oaks was well-liked and became a popular president, contrasting the austerity of the Wilkinson administration. Oaks created a Faculty Advisory Council where faculty members could be elected to the committee. He also instituted a three-tiered system of general education examinations for undergraduates.

When Oaks took office as BYU president, he retained Robert K. Thomas as academic vice president and Ben E. Lewis as executive vice president, the same positions they had held under Wilkinson. Early in his administration, Oaks sought to delegate more authority to deans and department chairs. He also worked to create standardized lines of authority within the university.

Other major changes under Oaks included implementing a three-semester plan with full fall and winter semesters, and a split spring and summer term. This also shifted the end of the fall term to before Christmas. Oaks also oversaw a large-scale celebration of the BYU centennial. During his tenure at BYU, enrollment grew twenty percent; the average class size was maintained at thirty-four students. Library holdings increased to 2 million and the number of faculty members with doctorate degrees increased to 22 percent. The number of buildings constructed per year decreased to eight per year, compared to eleven per year during Wilkinson&#x27;s administration. Church appropriations increased from $19.5 million to $76 million, making up approximately one-third of the university&#x27;s income. Spending increased from $60 million to $240 million. Under the realization that faculty salaries were considerably low compared to other colleges in the western United States, BYU periodically increased the salary of employees, particularly female employees. Even with the raising of salaries, BYU faculty salaries were still about $1,000 less than other universities and colleges in the region. University income was bolstered by donations and fund-raising. In the mid-1960s, the university decided to name buildings after people who donated more than $500,000 to the university. The first building constructed entirely from private donations was the N. Eldon Tanner Building.

During his administration, Oaks worked to focus on the equal treatment of women in the workplace. BYU instituted affirmative action policies to hire more women and worked to equalize salaries of men and women employees. Despite affirmative action policies, the number of female full professors was almost unchanged after his presidency and BYU was behind other universities in the United States in the number of female employees by five percent. Oaks established an ad hoc committee over women&#x27;s affairs to investigate gender discrimination at BYU. In 1975, BYU instituted policies prohibiting unfair distribution of church-sponsored scholarships based on gender. While at BYU, Oaks led an effort to fight the application of Title IX to non-educational programs at schools that did not accept direct government aid. BYU was one of two initial schools to voice opposition to these policies. This issue ultimately ended in an agreement between the U.S. Department of Education and BYU that allowed BYU to retain requirements that all unmarried students live in gender-specific housing whether they lived on or off campus. Oaks was a proponent for a lack of federal government intrusion in the private education sector and served as president of the American Association of Presidents of Independent Colleges and Universities for three years.

His administration dealt with multiple attempts by the federal government to exert control over BYU. In 1975, what was then the U.S. Department of Housing, Education and Welfare, tried an unsuccessful attempt to state that BYU&#x27;s honor code was in some way discriminatory based on sex. The next year, the Justice Department tried to exert power against small landlords to no longer uphold BYU&#x27;s sex-separated housing standard, but ultimately BYU also prevailed over the dispute. In 1979, the Internal Revenue Service tried to force BYU to disclose names of its donors on the contention that they were over-valuing the worth of their donation to BYU. This case went to federal court where it was ruled that the demand was unjustified.

During his presidency, he co-authored &quot;Carthage Conspiracy: The Trial of the Accused Assassins of Joseph Smith&quot; with BYU professor of history Marvin S. Hill. The book received the Mormon History Association Best Book prize in 1976.

During his presidency at BYU, Oaks was known for his moderate personal views which largely contrasted with the ultra-conservative views of his predecessor, Wilkinson. Oaks struggled during his presidency to distance BYU and the LDS Church from the partisan political atmosphere that had become typical under Wilkinson. Oaks established a policy to prevent BYU administrators from participating in partisan politics. Oaks continued to attempt to separate politics from BYU in his dealings with W. Cleon Skousen. Skousen, a known anti-communist, was hired as a BYU religion professor by Wilkinson. Other professors in the religion department were very critical of his hiring, believing he was unqualified and was hired only because of his conservative viewpoints. During the Oaks administration, Skousen claimed to have been authorized to teach a new course about &quot;Priesthood and Righteous Government&quot;, which would be published clandestinely under the name &quot;Gospel Principles and Practices&quot;. This course was intended to be for ultra-conservative students to inform them of what to do about communist infiltration. Upon learning of Skousen&#x27;s intentions, Oaks informed the First Presidency that he would not be permitted to teach that course. Skousen was told to stop mixing church doctrine and politics and to stop activities associated with his educational politics-based organization called the &quot;Freeman Institute&quot;, now known as the National Center for Constitutional Studies. However, he largely ignored this instruction, and continued teaching his version of politically infused doctrine until his retirement from BYU in 1978. By the mid-1970s, the relationship between Oaks and some of the more conservative members of the board of trustees became strained, particularly with Ezra Taft Benson. During Oaks&#x27;s tenure, Benson condemned the undergraduate economics textbooks used as supporting &quot;Keynesian&quot; economics and he expressed concern as to whether faculty was teaching socialist economics. Oaks was displeased upon learning that the College of Social Sciences invited the leader of Utah&#x27;s Communist party to speak to political science classes, believing that it could have set an undesired precedent. Not long afterward, Oaks became upset when he learned that Benson had invited activist Phyllis Schlafy to address students despite having been rejected by the Speakers Committee previously due to her &quot;extreme&quot; views. Most prominently, Oaks fought against the hiring of conservative Richard Vetterli despite the promise Wilkinson had made in hiring him before his resignation. Wilkinson lobbied Benson in appointing Vetterli after he left BYU and Benson and the board of trustees approved his appointment despite claims from Oaks that Vetterli was not qualified. Soon afterward, Oaks was released as BYU president and Jeffrey R. Holland took his place. The press cited the stand-off between Benson and Oaks in regard to Vetterli as a contributing factor to Oaks&#x27;s release. Oaks on the other hand fully stated his leaving BYU was caused by his being worn out from having run the institution for nine years.

When Oaks had been in office for six years, he wrote to the First Presidency believing that he had become close-minded in his position and suggested that BYU establish a six- or seven-year term limit for its presidents. His proposal was tabled for more than two years before he was unexpectedly notified of his release by the news media. After serving for nine years, he stepped down in August 1980. Oaks was appointed to the Utah Supreme Court three months later.

===Utah Supreme Court===

Upon leaving BYU, Oaks was appointed as a justice of the Utah Supreme Court on January 1, 1981, by Utah governor Scott M. Matheson. He served in this capacity from 1980 to 1984, when he resigned after being appointed by the LDS Church as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In 1975, Oaks was listed by U.S. attorney general Edward H. Levi among potential Gerald Ford Supreme Court candidates. In 1981, he was closely considered by the Ronald Reagan administration as a Supreme Court nominee.

====Scholarly research and notable opinions====
As a law professor, Oaks focused his scholarly research on the writ of habeas corpus and the exclusionary rule. In &quot;California v. Minjares&quot;, Justice William H. Rehnquist, in a dissenting opinion, wrote &quot;[t]he most comprehensive study on the exclusionary rule is probably that done by Dallin Oaks for the American Bar Foundation in 1970. According to this article, it is an open question whether the exclusionary rule deters the police from violating Fourth Amendment protections of individuals.

Oaks also undertook a legal analysis of the Nauvoo City Council&#x27;s actions against the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;. He opined that while the destruction of the &quot;Expositors printing press was legally questionable, under the law of the time the newspaper certainly could have been declared libelous and therefore a public nuisance by the Nauvoo City Council. As a result, Oaks concludes that while under contemporaneous law it would have been legally permissible for city officials to destroy, or &quot;abate&quot;, the actual printed newspapers, the destruction of the printing press itself was probably outside of the council&#x27;s legal authority, and its owners could have sued for damages.

As a Utah Supreme Court justice from 1980 to 1984, Oaks authored opinions on a variety of topics. In &quot;In Re J. P.&quot;, a proceeding was instituted on a petition of the Division of Family Services to terminate parental rights of child J.P.&#x27;s natural mother. Oaks wrote that a parent has a fundamental right protected by the Constitution to sustain their relationship with their child but that a parent can nevertheless be deprived of parental rights upon a showing of unfitness, abandonment, and substantial neglect.

In &quot;KUTV, Inc. v. Conder&quot;, media representatives sought review by appeal and by a writ of prohibition of an order barring the media from using the words &quot;Sugarhouse rapist&quot; or disseminating any information on past convictions of the defendant during the pendency of a criminal trial. Oaks, in the opinion delivered by the court, held that the order barring the media from using the words &quot;Sugarhouse rapist&quot; or disseminating any information on past convictions of defendant during the pendency of the criminal trial was invalid on the ground that it was not accompanied by the procedural formalities required for the issuance of such an order.

In &quot;Wells v. Children&#x27;s Aid Soc. of Utah&quot;, an unwed minor father brought action through a guardian ad litem seeking custody of a newborn child that had been released to the state adoption agency and subsequently to adoptive parents after the father had failed to make timely filing of his acknowledgment of paternity as required by statute. Oaks, writing the opinion for the court, held that the statute specifying the procedure for terminating parental rights of unwed fathers was constitutional under due process clause of the United States Constitution.

Among works edited by Oaks is a collection of essays entitled &quot;The Wall Between Church and State.&quot; Since becoming an apostle, Oaks has consistently spoken in favor of religious freedom and warned that it is under threat. He testified as an official representative of the LDS Church on behalf of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act during congressional hearings in 1991, and then in 1998 in favor of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. This was one of few occasions on which the church has sent a representative to testify on behalf of a bill before the U.S. Congress.

==LDS Church service==

While a law student, Oaks served as an elders quorum leader in his ward in Chicago. After he returned to the Chicago Metro Area after being a clerk to Justice Warren, Oaks was a counselor in the ward Sunday School presidency starting in 1959. He also was a counselor in the presidency of the Chicago Stake genealogical organization. He was then called as a stake missionary and counselor in the stake mission presidency, a set of positions at the time that required him to spend about 40 hours a month proselytizing.

In 1962, Oaks served as the stake mission president in the church&#x27;s Chicago Illinois Stake. He was set apart to this position by Boyd K. Packer, who was then an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

In 1963, he served as second counselor in the presidency of the newly created Chicago Illinois South Stake. He was set apart to this office by Howard W. Hunter. He later served briefly as the first counselor in the same stake in 1970 but was released when he was appointed as BYU&#x27;s president and moved to Utah.

During part of his time as BYU president, Oaks served as a regional representative, assigned to oversee some of the stakes in the Salt Lake Valley. After leaving BYU, Oaks conducted research and other assignments for the church&#x27;s special affairs committee, headed by Gordon B. Hinckley, and overseeing public relations, government relations, and related matters. In the years prior to his call as an apostle, Oaks served as a teacher in his ward Sunday School organization, first in a class for the 16-year-olds and later in the class for adults.

===Quorum of the Twelve Apostles===
On April 7, 1984, during the Saturday morning session of the LDS Church&#x27;s general conference, Oaks was sustained an apostle and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. In addition to advisory and operational duties, as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, Oaks is accepted by the church as a prophet, seer, and revelator.

Although sustained on April 7, Oaks was not ordained an apostle until May 3, 1984. He was given this time between sustaining and ordination to complete his judicial commitments. Of the shift from judge to apostolic witness, Oaks commented, &quot;Many years ago, Thomas Jefferson coined the metaphor, &#x27;the wall between church and state.&#x27; I have heard the summons from the other side of the wall. I&#x27;m busy making the transition from one side of the wall to the other.&quot; At age 51, he was the youngest apostle in the quorum at the time and the youngest man to be called to the quorum since Boyd K. Packer, who was called in 1970 at age 45.

From 1985 to 2000, and again from 2005 to 2010, Oaks served as one of the advisors to the church&#x27;s history department, where he served with Russell M. Nelson in this assignment during the latter time period. For several years Oaks was also closely involved with the church&#x27;s public relations operations.

Oaks has spoken on behalf of the LDS Church on political issues, primarily those affecting religious liberty. In 1992, he testified before committees in the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives on the proposed Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), arguing that it would be a step in the right direction in maintaining protection of religious liberty after the precedent set by &quot;Employment Division v. Smith&quot; (1990). Oaks spoke again after the law had passed in 1993 and had subsequently been ruled unconstitutional a few years later.

In 1989 Oaks traveled to India to dedicate that country for the preaching of the gospel.

From 2002 to 2004, Oaks presided over the church&#x27;s Philippines Area. Responsibility for presiding over such areas is generally delegated to members of the Quorums of the Seventy. The assignment of Oaks, along with Jeffrey R. Holland, who served in Chile at the same time, was aimed at addressing challenges in developing areas of the church, including rapid growth in membership, focus on retention of new converts, and training local leadership. During his first year as president, Oaks and his counselors, Angel Abrea and Richard J. Maynes, focused on three main goals: teaching doctrine and building faith, shifting efforts more towards retention, and establishing programs of activity for youth. In his second year there, Abrea was replaced by Rex E. Garrett and increasing both temple attendance and the number of Filipinos serving missions were added to their focus.

On February 26, 2010, Oaks addressed students at the annual Mormonism 101 Series convened at Harvard Law School.

In April 2015, included as part of an assignment to tour Argentina, Oaks gave a speech on religious freedom to the Argentine Council for International Relations.

Among other assignments, Oaks has served as the senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on the Church Board of Education and Boards of Trustees (CES Board), including as chairman of its executive committee.

===Counselor in the First Presidency===
In January 2018, Russell M. Nelson became the church&#x27;s new president. As the apostle second in seniority to Nelson, Oaks became President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. However, since Oaks was appointed as Nelson&#x27;s first counselor in the First Presidency, M. Russell Ballard was appointed as the quorum&#x27;s acting president. As first counselor in the First Presidency, Oaks serves as first vice chairman of the CES Board.

On June 1, 2018, Oaks gave the opening address at the First Presidency-sponsored &quot;Be One&quot; event, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the revelation extending the priesthood and access to temple ordinances, such as the endowment and sealing, to all worthy males, regardless of race. Oaks spoke of seeing the hurt that the restriction had caused, more so while he was a resident of Washington, D.C., and Chicago than he had seen in Utah. He also spoke of how the announcement had been a very emotional time for him. He noted that, prior to the 1978 announcement, having studied many explanations for the priesthood restriction, he concluded that he was not satisfied that any offered explanation for the restriction was inspired. Oaks called on people to not dwell too deeply on past policies but to look forward to a brighter future. He also denounced any prejudices, be they racial, ethnic, economic, or others and called on anyone who held such beliefs to repent.

In October 2020, Oaks gave a talk at general conference in which he encouraged civility and denounced racism. On October 27, 2020, he gave a BYU devotional address in which he again touched on this topic, explicitly endorsing the message &quot;Black lives matter&quot; while also discouraging its use to advance controversial propositions. In May 2022, Oaks delivered a eulogy at the funeral service of former Senator Orrin Hatch.

==Awards and honors==
Oaks earned the rank of Eagle Scout in 1947, and he was honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1984. He was named &quot;Judge of the Year&quot; by the Utah State Bar in 1984. Oaks received an honorary degree from Southern Utah University in 1991. And, he was bestowed the Lee Lieberman Otis Award for Distinguished Service by the Federalist Society in 2012. He received the Canterbury Medal from the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty in 2013, and he received the Pillar of the Valley Award by Utah Valley Chamber of Commerce in 2014. In 2021, he was honored by America&#x27;s Freedom Festival for his lifetime of work promoting the values of God, family, freedom, and country. Oaks was named an honorary board member of the World Congress of Families. 

Students at the University of Chicago Law School created the Dallin H. Oaks Society to &quot;increase awareness within the Law School community of the presence, beliefs, and concerns of law students who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;.

==Family==
Oaks married June Dixon (born 1933) on June 24, 1952. She died from cancer on July 21, 1998. They had six children, including Dallin D. Oaks, a linguistics professor at BYU, and Jenny Oaks Baker, a violinist. Their last child, Jenny, was born 13 years after their fifth child.

On August 25, 2000, Oaks married Kristen Meredith McMain in the Salt Lake Temple. McMain was in her early 50s, and it was her first marriage; she had previously served a mission for the LDS Church in the Japan Sendai Mission. McMain has bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from the University of Utah and a doctorate in curriculum and instruction from BYU.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; &quot;the Day of Wrath&quot;) is a Latin sequence attributed to either Thomas of Celano of the Franciscans (1200–1265) or to Latino Malabranca Orsini (d. 1294), lector at the Dominican at Santa Sabina, the forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (the ) in Rome. The sequence dates from the 13th century at the latest, though it is possible that it is much older, with some sources ascribing its origin to St. Gregory the Great (d. 604), Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153), or Bonaventure (1221–1274).

It is a medieval Latin poem characterized by its accentual stress and rhymed lines. The metre is trochaic. The poem describes the Last Judgment, the trumpet summoning souls before the throne of God, where the saved will be delivered and the unsaved cast into eternal flames.

It is best known from its use in the Roman Rite Catholic Requiem Mass (Mass for the Dead or Funeral Mass). An English version is found in various Anglican Communion service books.

The first melody set to these words, a Gregorian chant, is one of the most quoted in musical literature, appearing in the works of many composers. The final couplet, , has been often reused as an independent song.

==Use in the Roman liturgy==
The &quot;&quot; has been used in the Roman Rite liturgy as the sequence for the Requiem Mass for centuries, as made evident by the important place it holds in musical settings such as those by Mozart and Verdi. It appears in the Roman Missal of 1962, the last edition before the implementation of the revisions that occurred after the Second Vatican Council. As such, it is still heard in churches where the Tridentine Latin liturgy is celebrated. It also formed part of the pre-conciliar liturgy of All Souls&#x27; Day.

In the reforms to the Catholic Church&#x27;s Latin liturgical rites ordered by the Second Vatican Council, the &quot;Consilium for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Liturgy&quot;, the Vatican body charged with drafting and implementing the reforms (1969–70), eliminated the sequence as such from funerals and other Masses for the Dead. A leading figure in the post-conciliar liturgical reforms, Archbishop Annibale Bugnini, explained the rationale of the Consilium:
&quot;&quot;, slightly edited, remains in use &quot;ad libitum&quot; as a hymn in the Liturgy of the Hours on All Souls&#x27; Day and during the last week before Advent, for which it is divided into three parts for the Office of Readings, Lauds and Vespers, with the insertion of a doxology after each part.

===Indulgence===
In the Roman Catholic Church there was formerly an indulgence of three years for each recitation and a plenary indulgence for reciting the prayer daily for a month. This indulgence was not renewed in the Manual of Indulgences.

==Text==
The Latin text below is taken from the Requiem Mass in the 1962 Roman Missal. The first English version below, translated by William Josiah Irons in 1849, albeit from a slightly different Latin text, replicates the rhyme and metre of the original. This translation, edited for more conformance to the official Latin, is approved by the Catholic Church for use as the funeral Mass sequence in the liturgy of the Catholic ordinariates for former Anglicans. The second English version is a more dynamic equivalence translation.

Because the last two stanzas differ markedly in structure from the preceding stanzas, some scholars consider them to be an addition made in order to suit the great poem for liturgical use. The penultimate stanza, , discards the consistent scheme of rhyming triplets in favour of a pair of rhyming couplets. The last stanza, , abandons rhyme for assonance, and, moreover, its lines are catalectic.

In the liturgical reforms of 1969–71, stanza 19 was deleted and the poem divided into three sections: 1–6 (for Office of Readings), 7–12 (for Lauds) and 13–18 (for Vespers). In addition, in stanza 13 was replaced by so that that line would now mean, &quot;You who absolved the sinful woman&quot;. This was because modern scholarship denies the common mediæval identification of the woman taken in adultery with Mary Magdalene, so Mary could no longer be named in this verse. In addition, a doxology is given after stanzas 6, 12 and 18:

===Manuscript sources===
The text of the sequence is found, with slight verbal variations, in a 13th-century manuscript in the Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III at Naples. It is a Franciscan calendar missal that must date between 1253 and 1255 for it does not contain the name of Clare of Assisi, who was canonized in 1255, and whose name would have been inserted if the manuscript were of later date.

===Inspiration===
A major inspiration of the hymn seems to have come from the Vulgate translation of Zephaniah 1:15–16:

Other images come from the Book of Revelation, such as (the book from which the world will be judged), (sheep and goats, right hand, contrast between the blessed and the accursed doomed to flames), (trumpet), (heaven and earth burnt by fire), and (&quot;men fainting with fear... they will see the Son of Man coming&quot;). 

From the Jewish liturgy, the prayer Unetanneh Tokef appears to be related: &quot;We shall ascribe holiness to this day, For it is awesome and terrible&quot;; &quot;the great trumpet is sounded&quot;, etc.

===Other translations===
A number of English translations of the poem have been written and proposed for liturgical use. A very loose Protestant version was made by John Newton; it opens:

Jan Kasprowicz, a Polish poet, wrote a hymn entitled which describes the Judgment day. The first six lines (two stanzas) follow the original hymn&#x27;s metre and rhyme structure, and the first stanza translates to &quot;The trumpet will cast a wondrous sound&quot;.

The American writer Ambrose Bierce published a satiric version of the poem in his 1903 book &quot;Shapes of Clay&quot;, preserving the original metre but using humorous and sardonic language; for example, the second verse is rendered:

The Rev. Bernard Callan (1750–1804), an Irish priest and poet, translated it into Gaelic around 1800. His version is included in a Gaelic prayer book, &quot;The Spiritual Rose&quot;.

===Literary references===
* Walter Scott used the first two stanzas in the sixth canto of his narrative poem &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot; (1805).
* Johann Wolfgang von Goethe used the first, the sixth and the seventh stanza of the hymn in the scene &quot;&quot; in the first part of his drama &quot;Faust&quot; (1808).
* Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Sonnet on Hearing the Dies Iræ Sung in the Sistine Chapel&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;, 1881), contrasts the &quot;terrors of red flame and thundering&quot; depicted in the hymn with images of &quot;life and love&quot;.
* In Gaston Leroux&#x27;s 1910 novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, Erik (the Phantom) has the chant displayed on the wall of his funereal bedroom.
* It is the inspiration for the title and major theme of the 1964 novel by Philip K. Dick and Roger Zelazny. The English translation is used verbatim in Dick&#x27;s novel &quot;Ubik&quot; two years later.

==Music==
The words of &quot; have often been set to music as part of the Requiem service. In some settings, it is broken up into several movements; in such cases, &quot; refers only to the first of these movements, the others being titled according to their respective incipits.

The earliest surviving polyphonic setting of the Requiem by Johannes Ockeghem does not include &quot;. The first polyphonic settings to include the &quot; are by Engarandus Juvenis (1490) and Antoine Brumel (1516) to be followed by many composers of the renaissance. Later, many notable choral and orchestral settings of the Requiem including the sequence were made by composers such as Charpentier, Delalande, Mozart, Berlioz, Verdi, Britten and Stravinsky. Giovanni Battista Martini ended his set of (mostly humorous) 303 canons with a set of 20 on extracts of the sequence poem.

=== 13th-Century Gregorian Chant ===
The original Gregorian setting, dating back to the 13th century, was a sombre plainchant (or Gregorian chant). 

It is in the Dorian mode. In four-line neumatic notation, it begins:
In 5-line staff notation:

<doc id="183670" wikidata="Q503427" url="?curid=183670" title="Clitoral hood">
<text>In female humans and other mammals, the clitoral hood (also called preputium clitoridis, clitoral prepuce, and clitoral foreskin) is a fold of skin that surrounds and protects the glans of the clitoris; it also covers the external clitoral shaft, develops as part of the labia minora and is homologous with the foreskin (also called the &quot;prepuce&quot;) in the male reproductive system.
The clitoral hood is composed of mucocutaneous tissues; these tissues are between the mucous membrane and the skin, and they may have immunological importance because they may be a point of entry of mucosal vaccines.

==Development and variation==
The clitoral hood is formed during the fetal stage by the cellular lamella. The cellular lamella grows down on the dorsal side of the clitoris and is eventually fused with the clitoris.

The clitoral hood varies in the size, shape, thickness, and other aesthetic aspects. Some women have large clitoral hoods that completely cover the clitoral glans. Some of these can be retracted to expose the clitoral glans, such as for hygiene purposes or for pleasure; others do not retract. Other women have smaller hoods that do not cover the full length of the clitoral glans, leaving the clitoral glans exposed all the time. Sticky bands of tissue called &quot;adhesions&quot; can form between the hood and the glans; these stick the hood onto the glans so the hood cannot be pulled back to expose the glans and smegma can accumulate.

==Stimulation==

The clitoral glans itself is very sensitive and its direct stimulation, such as in cases where the hood is retracted, is often not enjoyable. Females with hoods covering most of the clitoral glans can often masturbate by stimulating the hood over the clitoral glans; those with smaller, or more compact, structures tend to rub the clitoral glans and hood together. The clitoral hood provides protection to the clitoral glans, analogous to the foreskin on the penile glans.

==Modifications==
In most of the world, clitoral modifications are uncommon. In some cultures, female genital mutilation (FGM) is practiced as a rite of passage into womanhood, is perceived as an improvement to the appearance of the genitalia, or is used to suppress or reduce female sexual desire and pleasure (including masturbation). During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, FGM was performed on many children in Western countries, including the United States, to discourage masturbation and reduce diseases believed to relate to it.

One modification that females sometimes choose is to have the hood pierced and insert jewelry, both for adornment and physical pleasure. Though less common, other females opt to have their own hood surgically trimmed or removed so as to permanently expose part or all of the clitoral glans.

==Other animals==
Regarding the clitoral prepuce in non-primate mammals, there is a similar structure typically referred to as the clitoral sheath, which is homologous to the penile sheath in male mammals.

<doc id="183672" wikidata="Q361204" url="?curid=183672" title="Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond">
<text>Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond ( – 3 November 1456), also known as Edmund of Hadham, was the father of King Henry VII of England and a member of the Tudor family of Penmynydd. Born to Sir Owen Tudor and the dowager queen Catherine of Valois, Edmund was the half-brother of Henry VI of England. He was raised for several years by Katherine de la Pole, and Henry took an interest in Edmund&#x27;s upbringing, granting him a title and lands once he came of age. Both Edmund and his brother, Jasper, were made advisers to the King, as they were his closest remaining blood relatives.

The brothers were made senior earls in the royal court and had influential positions in the Parliament of England. Edmund was also granted Baynard&#x27;s Castle, London, and ran a successful estate. He was married to Lady Margaret Beaufort, after her first marriage was annulled. Prior to the start of the Wars of the Roses, Edmund liaised with Richard, Duke of York, and supported him when the King fell ill during 1453–1454. After war began in 1455, York sent Edmund to uphold the authority of the King in South Wales. While he was there, York was overthrown by the King and, in retaliation, Yorkist forces were sent to engage those of Tudor&#x27;s in South Wales. Edmund was captured and imprisoned at Carmarthen Castle, where he died of the bubonic plague on 3 November 1456, three months before the birth of his son, the future Henry VII.

==Birth and early life==
Following the death of Henry V of England, the Queen dowager Catherine of Valois married Owen Tudor. The marriage was in secret, and was not common knowledge until after Catherine&#x27;s death. It is accepted that Catherine and Owen were married around 1429/30, as the Queen stopped living in the household of her son Henry VI, and Owen was granted the rights of an Englishman in the Parliament of May 1432.

The children of Catherine and Owen were born away from court. Their first son, Edmund, was born at Much Hadham Palace, Hertfordshire. The manor house was owned by the Bishop of London. In 1436, his mother retired to Bermondsey Abbey, where she died on 3 January 1437. With Catherine dead, the Queen&#x27;s enemies moved against Owen. He was called to London, but was acquitted by the Royal court of charges relating to the marriage. While en route to Wales, he was arrested and imprisoned in Newgate Prison. After he escaped in early 1438, he was recaptured and imprisoned once more in Windsor Castle.

Following the death of their mother and the imprisonment of their father, Edmund and his brother Jasper were brought up in the care of Katherine de la Pole, the daughter of Michael de la Pole, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, with whom they remained till at least March 1442. Henry VI began to take notice of his half-brothers by that point. He ensured that they were placed in the care of priests who oversaw their teaching. Edmund, and his brother and father, were taken into Henry&#x27;s royal household. Henry was seemingly fond of his half brothers, and ennobled each of them with Edmund becoming Earl of Richmond on 15 December 1449, and Jasper Earl of Pembroke on 23 November 1452.

==Earl of Richmond==

As earls and half-brothers of the king, Edmund and Jasper had unparalleled precedence over all other non-clerics in the court, with the exception of the dukes. They were each given lands, although Jasper received a yearly stipend until Pembroke became available. After seven years of marriage to Margaret of Anjou, Henry was still childless. After the death of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, the royal line was at risk, and the Tudor brothers were considered as possible heirs. There were concerns that while they were of French royal descent through Catherine, they had no blood relation to the English throne.

By 1452, Edmund and Jasper were both among Henry&#x27;s small group of personal advisers; they were the only blood relations in court. However, neither was skilled at matters of state within England, and instead they were primarily given the task of ensuring the authority of the king within Wales. This resulted in a long-held affection for the family in that country. The formal investiture of the duo took place in the Tower of London on 5 January 1453. Later that year on 6 March, they took their seats in the Parliament of England as the head of all the earls in the court. After a petition by the House of Commons of England, both Jasper and Edmund were recognised officially as legitimate half-brothers of the king and the statutory disabilities associated with being considered Welsh were removed. In 1452 and 1453, Henry gave them large monetary grants, and also gave Edmund property in Westmorland and Lancashire. Edmund ran a profitable estate and invested in the wool industry based in Boston, Lincolnshire. Henry also granted him the medieval palace of Baynard&#x27;s Castle, near to the River Thames in London.
==Wars of the Roses and marriage==
In the summer of 1453, Henry suffered a mental breakdown which lasted over 17 months. Several parties sought to take power during this period. Henry&#x27;s wife, Margaret of Anjou, demanded to be declared regent. The Tudor brothers supported Richard of York, who sought to become Protector of the Realm. However, Edmund did not attend the Parliament of 3 April 1454 where York was named protector. Edmund did attend York&#x27;s council of advisors, although not as frequently as Jasper. Both brothers were in attendance in November 1445, when the council reduced the size of the royal household. As a result, they each received an entourage of a chaplain, two esquires, two yeomen and two chamberlains.

Henry recovered around Christmas of 1454, and dismissed York, with resultant hostility. This left the Tudor brothers in a quandary. Edmund was not at the First Battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455, where Henry was captured by Richard of York. Both brothers attended the following Parliament where York was once again named Protector. While York cancelled the majority of the grants Henry had made during his reign, those to Edmund and Jasper were exempt. Both brothers were absent when the second session of Parliament that year began on 12 November; Edmund had been sent to Wales to put down the rebellion of Gruffudd ap Nicolas.

Margaret Beaufort was the daughter and only child of John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset. Through her father, she also was a great-granddaughter of John of Gaunt. As such she carried a claim to the throne. Thus she was married as a child to John de la Pole, son of the ambitious Duke of Suffolk. However, the Duke was murdered in 1450.

In early 1453, the marriage of Margaret and John was annulled, and on 24 March Edmund was given wardship of Margaret, still only nine years old. Edmund married Margaret on 1 November 1455 at Bletsoe Castle. It was through Margaret that Edmund&#x27;s son could claim the English throne.

The marriage was consummated immediately. Edmund died a year later, leaving a 13-year-old widow who was seven months pregnant with their child, Henry Tudor.

==Capture, captivity and death==

Gruffudd made war with the troops under Edmund, capturing the castles at Aberystwyth, Carmarthen and Carreg Cennen by June 1456. The rebellion didn&#x27;t last long, and by early August, Edmund&#x27;s forces had retaken those castles although minor skirmishes continued for several months longer. While Edmund was in Wales, the King had deposed York. In retaliation, York sent 2,000 men under William Herbert on 10 August to take South Wales. When they arrived at Carmarthen Castle, they took the stronghold and captured Edmund Tudor.

As Herbert&#x27;s troops moved on to Aberystwyth, Edmund was left behind, imprisoned in Carmarthen Castle. On 3 November 1456, Edmund became infected with the bubonic plague and died there. He was buried at the nearby Franciscan Church in Carmarthen. There were suspicions that Edmund may have been murdered, and so a trial was held several months later with several parties accused, but no one was found guilty. Edmund&#x27;s remains were removed to the choir of St David&#x27;s Cathedral, Pembrokeshire, in 1539, due to the dissolution of the monasteries enacted by his grandson, King Henry VIII of England of the Royal House of Tudor.

<doc id="183673" wikidata="Q23391" url="?curid=183673" title="Portcullis">
<text>A portcullis () is a heavy, vertically closing gate typically found in medieval fortifications. A &quot;portcullis&quot; gate is constructed of a latticed grille, made of wood or metal or both, which slides down grooves inset within each jamb of the gateway.

==Usage==

Portcullises fortified the entrances to many medieval castles, securely closing them off during times of attack or siege. Every portcullis was mounted in vertical grooves in the walls of the castle and could be raised or lowered quickly by using chains or ropes attached to an internal winch. Portcullises had an advantage over standard gates in that they could be closed immediately at a time of crisis by a single guard.

Two portcullises to the main entrance would often be used. The one closer to the inside would be closed first, and then the one further away. This was used to trap enemies, and burning wood or fire-heated sand would usually be dropped onto them from murder-holes or the roof. Hot oil, however, was not commonly used in this manner, contrary to popular belief, since oil was extremely expensive. Arrowslits in the sides of the walls enabled archers and crossbowmen to kill the trapped group of attackers.

In England, working portcullises survive at the Tower of London, Monk Bar in York, Hever Castle in Kent, and at the hotel conversion, Amberley Castle. In Scotland, a working portcullis is at Edinburgh Castle.

==Heraldry==

The portcullis was the heraldic badge of the House of Beaufort, and the first Tudor king, Henry VII, who was of matrilineal Beaufort descent, adapted both the portcullis and the Tudor rose into Royal badges of the House of Tudor. Since then, the portcullis has been a moderately common motif of English heraldry, especially that heraldry dating from the Tudor period. The heraldic office of Portcullis Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary, a junior officer of arms in the College of Arms at London, dates from this period.

Through Lord Charles Somerset, son of The 5th Duke of Beaufort, the portcullis has found its way into several South African coats of arms. Somerset established several towns during his governorship at the then-Cape Colony and named them for his family. These include Worcester, Somerset West, Fort Beaufort, and Beaufort West. Institutions that derive the portcullis from these arms include a school, a chamber of commerce, and a rugby club. Other (around 30) South African coats of arms that include a portcullis are not necessarily related to either Lord Charles Somerset or any of the towns named after and by him.
Although the Palace of Westminster served as the official royal residence for both Henry VII and Henry VIII until 1530, the current use of the portcullis as a symbol of the palace and of Parliament does not date from that time. Rather, the symbol was developed as part of Sir Charles Barry&#x27;s plans for the rebuilt palace after the original burned down on 16 October 1834; he conceptualized the new palace as a &quot;legislative castle&quot;, and the symbol of a castle gate—i.e., a portcullis—fit well with the scheme.

Since then, the portcullis has become the primary symbol of Parliament; an office building for Members of Parliament (MPs), opened in 2001, is named &quot;Portcullis House&quot;. During the 20th century, use of the portcullis as a symbol of Parliament spread beyond Britain and to the other Commonwealth realms. For instance, the coat of arms of Canberra has a portcullis in its crest, preserving a connection between the British Parliament at Westminster and the Australian Parliament to which Canberra is home.
The badge, coat of arms, and flag of the Canada Border Services Agency all include a portcullis, symbolizing the agency&#x27;s role as His Majesty&#x27;s agents responsible for the border services of Canada. A portcullis was previously found on the British one-penny coin and on the predecimal thrupenny bit; this has since been replaced by a section of the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom. It was also featured in the now-defunct HM Customs and Excise in the United Kingdom and still appears in the rank insignia for the various grades of commissioner in the Australian Border Force.

The portcullis may appear:

* as a charge in its own right, as in the arms of the London Borough of Richmond: &quot;Ermine, a portcullis chained or, a bordure gules charged with eight fleurs-de-lys or&quot;
** with nail heads shown in a contrasting colour, as in the arms of Wallingford Town Council: &quot;Gules, a portcullis or studded sable, chained Argent, ensigned with an ancient crown of the second, all within an orle of bezants&quot;
** with spikes of a contrasting colour, as in the crest of Tendring District Council: &quot;...a portcullis or, nailed and spiked azure&quot;
* in the gateways of castles, fully lowered or part raised, as in the arms of Winchester City Council: &quot;...five castles triple towered in saltire argent masoned proper the portcullis of each part-raised or...&quot;; though these do not appear in gateways of castles unless the blazon specifies them.

It is often shown with chains attached, even when the blazon does not mention them.

<text>SAM (Spanish acronym: &quot;Sociedad Aeronáutica de Medellín&quot;) was a Colombian airline. With its main hub at El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, SAM operated domestic and international routes and was a subsidiary of Avianca. In 2004, its headquarters were in the Avianca headquarters in Bogotá.

==History==
===Early operations===
In the 1940s, a group of entrepreneurs promoted the idea of providing the city of Medellín with an air transportation system that would connect with the rest of the country and the world. In October 1945, at the 3rd Notary Public&#x27;s Office, a deed incorporating &quot;Sociedad Aeronáutica de Medellín S.A.&quot; was recorded. The airline was in the minds of its first partners and promoters, who from the beginning of 1946 began to bring their dream to fruition.

The company had originally intended to acquire small aircraft, but the concept changed and grew. The airline would acquire long-range aircraft to secure the cargo market to and from Miami. The airline&#x27;s first Douglas C-47 arrived in October 1946 and departed from Las Playas Airport in Medellín heading to Miami in the midst of much celebration.

SAM transported mail from Medellín to Bogotá, Barrancabermeja, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, and later began regular flights to Panama and Miami with the Curtiss C-46. However, Avianca, which was the owner of several airports in the country, suspended SAM&#x27;s operations due to a ten-month delay in the payment of a debt. In 1954, after the merger of Avianca and LANSA, SAM restarted operations and created a subsidiary called &quot;RAS - Rutas Aéreas SAM&quot;. The company was advised by the Dutch airline KLM in its division in the Antilles.

===Later years===
In the second year of activities, SAM&#x27;s wings grew and began to embrace the world of the nearest Colombian cities with flights to Bogotá, Bucaramanga, Planeta Rica and Barranquilla. The airline grew quickly. Industrial and commercial activity increased to the point that in 1950s the fleet comprised 18 cargo aircraft and the destinations were now far afield. SAM&#x27;s aircraft flew to and from the Caribbean and South America.

Having proved its efficiency in air transportation and establishing the routes that put an end to the isolation of Medellín and Colombia, in 1958 SAM decided to begin carrying passengers. Passenger air service began with a DC-3 and a C-46, and one of the early milestones was San Andres, where it was the first airline to provide service to the island. Two years later, the first DC-4 was added to the fleet with a capacity of 65 passengers, but it was in 1970 that SAM became notable for inaugurating the Jet-Prop era in Colombia. The Santo Domingo Group had provided broader capital to enable accelerated modernization and expanded market share.

With the introduction of the Lockheed L-188 into service, the expansion into Central America was made possible and passenger services began to Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica with regular freight schedules that were operated to Miami. Later in 1977, SAM introduced the Boeing 720B which were transferred from Avianca, with which the Lockheed Electras were returned to Eastern Air Lines. 

Around 1990, SAM requested to resume cargo flights to the United States and the company made a request to Challenger Air Cargo to lease one of its Boeing 757s, at the same time that Avianca suspended cargo services to Miami, and sold its 747 freighters. The request was cancelled and SAM leased a Boeing 707-320C to carry out the flights to Miami. 

Starting in 1992, the company modernized its fleet with the Boeing 727-200, subsequently the Avro RJ100, and the De Havilland Canada Twin Otter as well. With these modern aircraft, SAM connected the most important cities of the country, as well as several regional and international destinations. However, there were problems with the RJ100 engines, which were paralyzed on the ground and the company had to use aircraft from Avianca to cover its flights, and the aircraft were returned to the manufacturer British Aerospace in March 2000, and purchased 3 Cessna 208 Caravans. Avianca&#x27;s Fokker 50 and McDonnell Douglas MD-83 were also assigned.

On May 20, 2002, SAM along with Avianca and ACES, joined and formed the &quot;Alianza Summa&quot; to offer a more efficient service to compete in a new struggling marketplace. However, in the following year, ACES was dissolved and Avianca was purchased by the Synergy Group and change its image, for which the colors of SAM disappeared. However, SAM operated 15 exclusive Fokker 100s in the Avianca livery with a sign that read &quot;Operated by Sam&quot; on the fuselage. 

SAM closed its operations on October 4, 2010, when its final flight took off from Bogotá bound for Medellín. With this flight, SAM was permanently merged into Avianca.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On March 1, 1950, a Douglas C-47 (registered HK-507) took off from Olaya Herrera Airport to conduct a test flight following repairs that were carried out on engine No. 1. Upon returning to the airport, the pilot was cleared to land. Shortly afterwards, the airplane entered an area of heavy strong winds. The aircraft impacted the ground, killing the co-pilot and one of the two mechanics.
*On June 13, 1951, a Douglas C-47 (registered HK-504) made an emergency return to Olaya Herrera Airport and crashed after striking a chimney of a factory in the Belén suburb of Medellín. Both crew members on board were killed, including a person on the ground.
*On September 10, 1952, a Curtiss C-46 (registered HK-513) was on a flight from San Andrés (island) to Cartagena, the crew encountered poor weather conditions and lost their route. The aircraft hit a mountain located in Guna Yala, Panama. All 46 occupants were killed.
*On September 16, 1958, a Curtiss C-46 (registered HK-514) crashed shortly after takeoff from Olaya Herrera Airport while in initial climb. The aircraft suffered an engine failure, the crew attempted an emergency landing in a wasteland where it crash landed. Both crew members were uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
*On December 8, 1959, a Curtiss C-46 (registered HK-515) en route from San Andrés to Cartagena, disappeared. About 8 days later, the right main gear wheel assembly was found near Moron Island. All 42 passengers and 3 crew were presumed killed.
*On March 19, 1960, SAM Flight 901, a Curtiss C-46 (registered HK-516), departed San Andres Island for a flight to Medellin when engine no.1 started to have problems. The crew radioed Medellin that they were returning to Planeta Rica, but the plane crashed 11 km Northwest. 25 of the 46 occupants on board were killed and the aircraft was written off.
*On February 5, 1969, a Douglas C-54 (registered HK-1065) was hijacked by an armed passenger. The aircraft was en route from Barranquilla to Cartagena, Medellín and Cali. The hijacked demanded the pilots to be flown to Cuba. None of the 47 occupants on board were injured.
*On March 11, 1969, a Douglas C-54 (registered HK-757) was hijacked during a domestic flight from Medellin to Barranquilla. A hijacker entered the cockpit and demanded to be flown to Cuba.
*On May 30, 1973, SAM Colombia Flight 601, a Lockheed L-188 Electra (registered HK-1274), flying from Cali to Medellin with a stopover in Pereira, was diverted from its route making stops in Aruba, Guayaquil, Lima, Mendoza, Asunción, and Buenos Aires, had been hijacked by two Paraguayan former football players for economic reasons.

Paramo de Frontino at 12,300 ft. while on approach to José María Córdova International Airport. The aircraft descended into mountainous terrain before actually reaching the Abejorral non-directional beacon. The (VHF/DME) had been sabotaged by terrorists and was not in service. All 132 passengers (including a group of Panamanian dentists and doctors on their way to a convention) were killed.
*On August 4, 1993, a Boeing 727-100 (registered HK-2421X) was damaged beyond repairs after its no. 3 engine caught on fire during maintenance work.

==In other areas==
SAM was the main sponsor of the Atlético Nacional football team between 1988 and 1994, the airline&#x27;s logo was used on the front of their jersey during competitions of those years, including the 1989 Copa Libertadores.

<text>Siegen-Wittgenstein is a Kreis (district) in the southeast of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Olpe, Hochsauerlandkreis, Waldeck-Frankenberg, Marburg-Biedenkopf, Lahn-Dill, Westerwaldkreis, and Altenkirchen.

==History==
In 1816–1817, the two districts of Siegen and Wittgenstein were created as parts of the Prussian province of Westphalia. In 1974, the two districts were merged, and in 1984 the name Siegen-Wittgenstein was adopted.

==Geography==
Geographically, it covers the hills southeast of the Sauerland hills, the Siegerland and Wittgensteiner Land.

==Coat of arms==
The two upper sections show, to the right, the arms of the Dukes of Nassau, who founded Siegen, and to the left, those of the Counts of Sayn-Wittgenstein. At the bottom a miner&#x27;s lamp and a coppicing hook are depicted, in reference to the mining and charcoal-burning history of the district.

<text>The Lenne is a tributary of the river Ruhr in the Sauerland hills, western Germany. It has caused flooding in recent years.

Having its source on top of the &quot;Kahler Asten&quot; near Winterberg in an intermittent spring at an elevation of , the Lenne ends after a course of 129 km flowing into the Ruhr river near the city of Hagen. With an average discharge of 25 m³/s near its mouth, it is the main tributary of the Ruhr.

<text>Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001) is a fragment of a Martian meteorite that was found in the Allan Hills in Antarctica on December 27, 1984, by a team of American meteorite hunters from the ANSMET project. Like other members of the shergottite–nakhlite–chassignite (SNC) group of meteorites, ALH84001 is thought to have originated on Mars. However, it does not fit into any of the previously discovered SNC groups. Its mass upon discovery was .

In 1996, a group of scientists found features in the likeness of microscopic fossils of bacteria in the meteorite, suggesting that these organisms also originated on Mars. The claims immediately made headlines worldwide, culminating in U.S. president Bill Clinton giving a speech about the potential discovery. These claims were controversial from the beginning, and the wider scientific community ultimately rejected the hypothesis once all the unusual features in the meteorite had been explained without requiring life to be present. Despite there being no convincing evidence of Martian life, the initial paper and the enormous scientific and public attention caused by it are considered turning points in the history of the developing science of astrobiology.

== History and description ==

ALH 84001 was found on the Allan Hills Far Western Icefield during the 1984–85 season, by Roberta Score, Lab Manager of the Antarctic Meteorite Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center.

ALH84001 is thought to be one of the oldest Martian meteorites, proposed to have crystallized from molten rock 4.091 billion years ago. Chemical analysis suggests that it originated on Mars when there was liquid water on the planet&#x27;s surface.

In September 2005, Vicky Hamilton, of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, presented an analysis of the origin of ALH84001 using data from the &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; and &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot; spacecraft orbiting Mars. According to the analysis, Eos Chasma in the Valles Marineris canyon appears to be the source of the meteorite. The analysis was not conclusive, partly because it was limited to areas of Mars not obscured by dust.

The theory holds that ALH84001 was blasted away from the surface of Mars by the impact of a meteor about 17 million years ago, and fell on Earth about 13,000 years ago. These dates were established by a variety of radiometric dating techniques, including samarium–neodymium (Sm–Nd), rubidium–strontium (Rb–Sr), potassium–argon (K–Ar), and carbon-14 dating. Other meteorites that have potential biological markings have generated less interest because they do not contain rock from a &quot;wet&quot; Mars; ALH84001 is the only meteorite originating when Mars may have had liquid surface water.

In October 2011, it was reported that isotopic analysis indicated that the carbonates in ALH84001 were precipitated at a temperature of with water and carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere. The carbonate carbon and oxygen isotope ratios imply deposition of the carbonates from a gradually evaporating subsurface water body, probably a shallow aquifer meters or tens of meters below the surface.

In April 2020, researchers reported discovering nitrogen-bearing organics in Allan Hills 84001.

A later study in January 2022 concluded that ALH84001 did not contain Martian life; the discovered organic molecules were found to be associated with abiotic processes (i.e., &quot;serpentinization and carbonation reactions that occurred during the aqueous alteration of basalt rock by hydrothermal fluids&quot;) produced on the very early Mars 4 billion years ago instead.

== Hypothetical biogenic features ==

On August 6, 1996, a team of researchers led by NASA scientists including lead author David S. McKay announced that the meteorite may contain trace evidence of life from Mars. This was 
published as an article in &quot;Science&quot; a few days later. Under a scanning electron microscope, structures were visible that some scientists interpreted as fossils of bacteria-like lifeforms. The structures found on ALH84001 are in diameter, similar in size to theoretical nanobacteria, but smaller than any cellular life known at the time of their discovery. If the structures had been fossilized lifeforms, as was proposed by the so-called biogenic hypothesis of their formation, they would have been the first solid evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life, aside from the chance of their origin being terrestrial contamination.

The announcement of possible extraterrestrial life caused considerable controversy. When the discovery was announced, many immediately conjectured that the fossils were the first true evidence of extraterrestrial life—making headlines around the world, and even prompting President of the United States Bill Clinton to make a formal televised announcement to mark the event.

McKay argued that likely microbial terrestrial contamination found in other Martian meteorites does not resemble the microscopic shapes in ALH84001. In particular, the shapes within ALH84001 look intergrown or embedded in the indigenous material, while likely contamination does not. While it has not yet conclusively been shown how the features in the meteorite were formed, similar features have been recreated in the lab without biological inputs by a team led by D.C. Golden. McKay says these results were obtained using unrealistically pure raw materials as a starting point, and &quot;will not explain many of the features described by us in ALH84001.&quot; According to McKay, a plausible inorganic model &quot;must explain simultaneously all of the properties that we and others have suggested as possible biogenic properties of this meteorite.&quot; The rest of the scientific community disagreed with McKay.

In January 2010, a team of scientists at Johnson Space Center, including McKay, argued that since their original paper was published in November 2009, the biogenic hypothesis has been further supported by the discovery of three times the original amount of fossil-like data, including more &quot;biomorphs&quot; (suspected Martian fossils), inside two additional Martian meteorites, as well as more evidence in other parts of the Allan Hills meteorite itself.

However, the scientific consensus is that &quot;morphology alone cannot be used unambiguously as a tool for primitive life detection.&quot; Interpretation of morphology is notoriously subjective, and its use alone has led to numerous errors of interpretation.

Features of ALH84001 that have been interpreted as suggesting the presence of microfossils include:

* The structures resemble some modern terrestrial bacteria and their appendages. Though some are much smaller than any known extant Earth microbes, others are of the order of 100–200 nm in size, within the size limits of &quot;Pelagibacter ubique&quot;, the most common bacterium on Earth, which ranges from 120 to 200 nm, as well as hypothetical nanobacteria. RNA organisms, which are expected to have lived on Earth during the time period when ALH84001 was ejected from Mars, may also have been as small or smaller than these structures, as modern RNA viruses and viroids are often as little as a few dozen nanometers. Some of the structures are even larger, 1–2 microns in diameter. The smallest structures are too small to contain all the systems required by modern life.
* Some of the structures resemble colonies and biofilms. However, there are many instances of morphologies that suggested life and were later shown to be due to inorganic processes.
* The meteorite contains magnetite crystals of the unusual rectangular prism type, and organized into domains all about the same size, indistinguishable from magnetite produced biologically on Earth and not matching any known non-biological magnetite that forms naturally on Earth. The magnetite is embedded in the carbonate. If found on Earth it would be a very strong biosignature. However, in 2001, scientists were able to explain and produce carbonate globules containing similar magnetite grains through an inorganic process simulating conditions ALH84001 likely experienced on Mars.
* It contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrated in the regions containing the carbonate globules, and these have been shown to be indigenous. Other organics such as amino acids do not follow this pattern and are probably due to Antarctic contamination. However, PAHs are also regularly found in asteroids, comets and meteorites, and in deep space, all in the absence of life.

==In popular culture==
The 2001 mystery-thriller novel &quot;Deception Point&quot; by Dan Brown, about a discovered meteorite that seems to prove the existence of extraterrestrial life, was inspired by ALH84001.

<doc id="183699" wikidata="Q120463" url="?curid=183699" title="Bulbourethral gland">
<text>The bulbourethral glands or Cowper&#x27;s glands (named for English anatomist William Cowper) are two small exocrine and accessory glands in the reproductive system of many male mammals. They are homologous to Bartholin&#x27;s glands in females. The bulbourethral glands are responsible for producing a pre-ejaculate fluid called Cowper&#x27;s fluid (known colloquially as &quot;pre-cum&quot;), which is secreted during sexual arousal, neutralizing the acidity of the urethra in preparation for the passage of sperm cells. The paired glands are found adjacent to the urethra just below the prostate, seen best by screening (medicine) MRI as a tool in preventative healthcare in males. Screening MRI may be performed when there is a positive prostate-specific antigen on basic laboratory tests. Prostate cancer is the second-most common cause of cancer-related mortality in males in the USA.

Most species of placental mammals have bulbourethral glands, but they are absent in Caniformia and Cetacea. They are the only accessory reproductive glands in male monotremes. Placental mammals usually have one pair of bulbourethral glands, while male marsupials have 1–3 pairs. Of all domesticated animals, they are absent only in dogs.

==Location==
Bulbourethral glands are located posterior and lateral to the membranous portion of the urethra at the base of the penis, between the two layers of the fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, in the deep perineal pouch. They are enclosed by transverse fibers of the sphincter urethrae membranaceae muscle.

==Structure==

The bulbourethral glands are compound tubulo-alveolar glands, each approximately the size of a pea in humans. In chimpanzees, they are not visible during dissection, but can be found on microscopic examination. In boars, they are up to 18 cm long and 5 cm in diameter. They are composed of several lobules held together by a fibrous covering. Each lobule consists of a number of acini, lined by columnar epithelial cells, opening into a duct that joins with the ducts of other lobules to form a single excretory duct. This duct is approximately 2.5 cm long and opens into the bulbar urethra at the base of the penis. The glands gradually diminish in size with advancing age.
==Function==

The bulbourethral gland contributes up to 4 ml of fluid during sexual arousal. The secretion is a clear fluid rich in mucoproteins that help to lubricate the distal urethra and neutralize any acidic urine residue that remains in the urethra.

According to one preliminary study, the bulbourethral gland fluid might not contain any sperm, whereas another study showed some men did leak sperm in potentially significant quantities (in a range from low counts up to 50 million sperm per ml) into the pre-ejaculatory fluid, potentially leading to conception from the introduction of pre-ejaculate. However, the sperm source is a residual or pre-ejaculatory leak from the testicles into the vasa deferentia, rather than from the bulbourethral gland itself.

<text>The Radiolaria, also called Radiozoa, are unicellular eukaryotes of diameter 0.1–0.2 mm that produce intricate mineral skeletons, typically with a central capsule dividing the cell into the inner and outer portions of endoplasm and ectoplasm. The elaborate mineral skeleton is usually made of silica. They are found as zooplankton throughout the global ocean. As zooplankton, radiolarians are primarily heterotrophic, but many have photosynthetic endosymbionts and are, therefore, considered mixotrophs. The skeletal remains of some types of radiolarians make up a large part of the cover of the ocean floor as siliceous ooze. Due to their rapid change as species and intricate skeletons, radiolarians represent an important diagnostic fossil found from the Cambrian onwards.

==Description==
Radiolarians have many needle-like pseudopods supported by bundles of microtubules, which aid in the radiolarian&#x27;s buoyancy. The cell nucleus and most other organelles are in the endoplasm, while the ectoplasm is filled with frothy vacuoles and lipid droplets, keeping them buoyant. The radiolarian can often contain symbiotic algae, especially zooxanthellae, which provide most of the cell&#x27;s energy. Some of this organization is found among the heliozoa, but those lack central capsules and only produce simple scales and spines.

Some radiolarians are known for their resemblance to regular polyhedra, such as the icosahedron-shaped &quot;Circogonia icosahedra&quot; pictured below.

==Taxonomy==
The radiolarians belong to the supergroup Rhizaria together with (amoeboid or flagellate) Cercozoa and (shelled amoeboid) Foraminifera. Traditionally the radiolarians have been divided into four groups—Acantharea, Nassellaria, Spumellaria and Phaeodarea. Phaeodaria is however now considered to be a Cercozoan. Nassellaria and Spumellaria both produce siliceous skeletons and were therefore grouped together in the group Polycystina. Despite some initial suggestions to the contrary, this is also supported by molecular phylogenies. The Acantharea produce skeletons of strontium sulfate and is closely related to a peculiar genus, &quot;Sticholonche&quot; (Taxopodida), which lacks an internal skeleton and was for long time considered a heliozoan. The Radiolaria can therefore be divided into two major lineages: Polycystina (Spumellaria + Nassellaria) and Spasmaria (Acantharia + Taxopodida).

There are several higher-order groups that have been detected in molecular analyses of environmental data. Particularly, groups related to Acantharia and Spumellaria. These groups are so far completely unknown in terms of morphology and physiology and the radiolarian diversity is therefore likely to be much higher than what is currently known.

The relationship between the Foraminifera and Radiolaria is also debated. Molecular trees support their close relationship—a grouping termed Retaria. But whether they are sister lineages or whether the Foraminifera should be included within the Radiolaria is not known.

==Biogeography==
In the diagram on the right, a Illustrates generalized radiolarian provinces and their relationship to water mass temperature (warm versus cool color shading) and circulation (gray arrows). Due to high-latitude water mass submergence under warm, stratified waters in lower latitudes, radiolarian species occupy habitats at multiple latitudes, and depths throughout the world oceans. Thus, marine sediments from the tropics reflect a composite of several vertically stacked faunal assemblages, some of which are contiguous with higher latitude surface assemblages. Sediments beneath polar waters include cosmopolitan deep-water radiolarians, as well as high-latitude endemic surface water species. Stars in (a) indicate the latitudes sampled, and the gray bars highlight the radiolarian assemblages included in each sedimentary composite. The horizontal purple bars indicate latitudes known for good radiolarian (silica) preservation, based on surface sediment composition. 

Data show that some species were extirpated from high latitudes but persisted in the tropics during the late Neogene, either by migration or range restriction (b). With predicted global warming, modern Southern Ocean species will not be able to use migration or range contraction to escape environmental stressors, because their preferred cold-water habitats are disappearing from the globe (c). However, tropical endemic species may expand their ranges toward midlatitudes. The color polygons in all three panels represent generalized radiolarian biogeographic provinces, as well as their relative water mass temperatures (cooler colors indicate cooler temperatures, and vice versa).

==Radiolarian shells==

Radiolarians are unicellular predatory protists encased in elaborate globular shells (or &quot;capsules&quot;), usually made of silica and pierced with holes. Their name comes from the Latin for &quot;radius&quot;. They catch prey by extending parts of their body through the holes. As with the silica frustules of diatoms, radiolarian shells can sink to the ocean floor when radiolarians die and become preserved as part of the ocean sediment. These remains, as microfossils, provide valuable information about past oceanic conditions.

:formula_1

The function formula_2, taken to be the radius vector from the centre to any point on the surface of the membrane, was argued to be representable as a series of normalised Legendre functions. The algebraic solution of the above equations ran to some 30 pages in my Thesis and are therefore not reproduced here. They are written in full in the book entitled “Morphogenesis” which is a tribute to Turing, edited by P. T. Saunders, published by North Holland, 1992.

The algebraic solution of the equations revealed a family of solutions, corresponding to a parameter n, taking values 2, 4. 6.

When I had solved the algebraic equations, I then used the computer to plot the shape of the resulting organisms. Turing told me that there were real organisms corresponding to what I had produced. He said that they were described and depicted in the records of the voyages of HMS Challenger in the 19th Century.

I solved the equations and produced a set of solutions which corresponded to the actual species of Radiolaria discovered by HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; in the 19th century. That expedition to the Pacific Ocean found eight variations in the growth patterns. These are shown in the following figures. The essential feature of the growth is the emergence of elongated &quot;spines&quot; protruding from the sphere at regular positions. Thus the species comprised two, six, twelve, and twenty, spine variations.

===Diversity and morphogenesis===
Bernard Richards, worked under the supervision of Alan Turing (1912–1954) at Manchester as one of Turing&#x27;s last students, helping to validate Turing’s theory of morphogenesis.

&quot;Turing was keen to take forward the work that D’Arcy Thompson had published in On Growth and Form in 1917&quot;.

==Fossil record==
The earliest known radiolaria date to the very start of the Cambrian period, appearing in the same beds as the first small shelly fauna—they may even be terminal Precambrian in age. They have significant differences from later radiolaria, with a different silica lattice structure and few, if any, spikes on the test. About ninety percent of known radiolarian species are extinct. The skeletons, or tests, of ancient radiolarians are used in geological dating, including for oil exploration and determination of ancient climates.

Some common radiolarian fossils include &quot;Actinomma&quot;, &quot;Heliosphaera&quot; and &quot;Hexadoridium&quot;.

<doc id="183702" wikidata="Q1391397" url="?curid=183702" title="Steve Jones (biologist)">
<text>John Stephen Jones (born 24 March 1944) is a British geneticist and, from 1995 to 1999 as well as from 2008 to June 2010, was Head of the Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment at University College London. His studies are conducted in the Galton Laboratory.

He is also a television presenter and a prize-winning author on the subject of biology, especially evolution. He is a popular contemporary writer on evolution. In 1996 his work won him the Michael Faraday Prize &quot;for his numerous, wide ranging contributions to the public understanding of science in areas such as human evolution and variation, race, sex, inherited disease and genetic manipulation through his many broadcasts on radio and television, his lectures, popular science books, and his once-regular science column in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and contributions to other newspaper media&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Jones was born in Aberystwyth, Wales, to Lydia Anne and Thomas Gwilym Jones. His parents met as students at the University of Aberystwyth. Until he was about ten years old the family lived alternately at his paternal grandparents&#x27; house in New Quay, Ceredigion, and his maternal grandparents&#x27; house near Aberystwyth. Later the family moved to the Wirral, returning to Wales for their holidays.

Jones&#x27;s paternal grandfather and great grandfather were both sea captains. Jones&#x27;s father, a PhD chemist, worked on detergents such as Jif. Dylan Thomas was an acquaintance of his father. As a child Jones often stayed at his paternal grandparents&#x27; home and spent a lot of his time in the attic which contained some seafaring equipment, and boxes of books covering a wide variety of topics, many of which Jones read. He also went to libraries and by the age of 14 years had read all the works of Charles Dickens.

As a child in Ceredigion Jones spoke a lot of Welsh until he was 6 or 7 years old, and as a keen observer of local wildlife was particularly interested in birds. Jones was a pupil at Wirral Grammar School for Boys. At the age of 13 to 14 years old Jones was inspired to study biology by a school teacher.

Jones was rejected by all the Welsh universities, so he applied to the University of Edinburgh for an undergraduate degree, which had a closing date seven days later, and he was accepted onto a zoology course. In 1967 he won the Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize in Zoology for his essay, “Area effects and the structure of peripheral populations of Cepaea nemoralis”. He stayed on in Edinburgh to do research for a Doctor of Philosophy degree on the ecological genetics of &quot;Cepaea&quot;, a snail whose shell is polymorphic in colour pattern, making it a model organism for evolutionary biologists. He developed an interest in snails from Bryan Clarke his PhD supervisor.

==Career and research==
After his PhD, Jones also completed post-doctoral research into the genetics of &quot;Drosophila&quot; at the University of Chicago to widen his experience. Much of Jones&#x27;s research has been concerned with snails and the light their study can shed on biodiversity and genetics.

=== Media and outreach ===
Jones was the 1991 Reith Lecturer on BBC Radio, with a series entitled &quot;The Language of the Genes&quot;, the basis of his 1993 book of the same name.

* Audio podcast: BBC Reith Lectures Archive: 1974 – 2010
* Transcripts: BBC Reith Lectures 1990 – 1999

For his Desert Island Discs book, Jones chose A Dance to the Music of Time. He gave the following reason for his choice: &quot;There is a series of books by Anthony Powell called A Dance to the Music of Time, which actually is a really lovely way of describing evolution. If I´d to take just one of them it would be The Valley of Bones&quot;. 

He presented &quot;In the Blood&quot;, a six-part TV series on human genetics first broadcast in 1996, see book of same name in bibliography. In July 2011, Jones produced a report dealing with science reporting issues at the BBC. He was critical of the BBC for giving too much space and credence to maverick views on science, including deniers of anthropogenic global warming.

Jones was commissioned by the BBC Trust to write a report on the organisation&#x27;s science reporting, which was published in July 2011. This was broadly supportive of the BBC&#x27;s accuracy, impartiality and science coverage although it also made some suggestions. These included better interaction of staff across the organisation on science topics and in particular an end to &quot;false balance&quot;. Jones describes &quot;[a]ttempts to give a place to anyone, however unqualified, who claims interest can make for false balance: to free publicity to marginal opinions and not to impartiality, but its opposite&quot;. The BBC&#x27;s response to the recommendations was generally positive, several of which it immediately implemented.

==Awards and honours==
Jones was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2012. He won their Michael Faraday Prize in 1996 and delivered the Reith Lectures in 1991. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2011. In 2011, he was elected a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales.

==Personal life==
Jones&#x27;s life partner since 1977 has been American documentary maker Norma Percy; they married in 2004.

Jones is a patron of Humanists UK and an honorary associate of the National Secular Society. He was awarded the second Irwin Prize for Secularist of the Year by the National Secular Society on 7 October 2006. On 1 January 2011 he became President of The Association for Science Education.

===Views on private education===
In an interview on the BBC Radio 5 show &#x27;5 Live Breakfast&#x27; hosted by Nicky Campbell and Shelagh Fogarty on 13 January 2009, Jones described private schools as a &quot;cancer on the education system&quot;.
Jones cites private schools as one of the reasons that Britain remains as socially stratified as it is. Among the advantages in private schools compared to state schools, Jones listed smaller class sizes, highly trained teachers, better facilities, and coaching through university interviews.

===Views on religion===
Jones, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published on 15 September 2010 in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s state visit to the UK. Jones has also stated that creationism is &quot;anti-science&quot; and criticised creationists such as Ken Ham. Jones suggested in a BBC Radio Ulster interview in 2006 that Creationists should be forbidden from being medical doctors because &quot;all of its (Creationism&#x27;s) claims fly in the face of the whole of science&quot; and he further claimed that no serious biologist can believe in biblical creation. For Jones, &#x27;evolution is the grammar of biology&#x27;. Jones elaborated on his full position on creationism in a public lecture entitled &#x27;Why creationism is wrong and evolution is right&#x27;.

National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C1672/12) with Steve Jones in 2015 for its Science and Religion collection held by the British Library.

===Views on human evolution===
Jones&#x27;s view that in humans &quot;Natural selection has to some extent been repealed&quot;
dates back at least to 1991 and has been the focus of newspaper reports and radio interviews. Referring to the title of a public lecture entitled &quot;Is human Evolution Over?&quot; he stated &quot;&quot;For those of you who have a train to catch, the answer is&quot; &quot;yes&quot;,&quot; so you can leave now&quot;&quot;.

His views are largely based on his claim that reduced juvenile mortality, decreasing age of fathers, and decreased geographical isolation of populations in Western societies reduce evolution. Both the data supporting these assertions and his views of the way these factors influence evolution in populations have been extensively criticised by other academics.

<doc id="183706" wikidata="Q3625646" url="?curid=183706" title="Assize of Clarendon">
<text>The Assize of Clarendon was an act of Henry II of England in 1166 that began a transformation of English law and led to trial by jury in common law countries worldwide, and that established assize courts. 

Prior systems for deciding the winning party in a case, especially felonies, included trial by ordeal, trial by battle, or trial by compurgation (trial by oath), in which evidence, inspection, and inquiry was made under oath by laymen, knights or ordinary freemen. After the Assize of Clarendon trial by jury developed, though some historians say beginnings of the jury system predate this act. The Assize of Clarendon did not lead to this change immediately; recourse to trial by combat was not officially rescinded until 1819, though by then it had fallen out of use. 

The assize takes its name from Clarendon Palace, Wiltshire, the royal hunting lodge at which it was promulgated.

==Problems addressed by the assize==
In 1154, Henry II inherited the throne of a troubled England. In full swing were the Crusades, a military endeavour that kept noble landowners away from their castles for years at a time. Unoccupied and unclaimed land invited squatters; since there was no central recording office for real property in England at the time, and sorting out who owned what fief was entrusted to human memory, disputes arose when aristocrats returned or died thousands of miles from home.

Another, even more, serious was the aftermath of The Anarchy, a disastrous civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda. The two factions had hired mercenary soldiers, and when there was no one left to pay them, many resorted to robbery and other forms of violence as a profession. Crime followed the breakdown of the local authority. The quarrel between the King and the Empress created more property troubles; as communities were divided, both factions were happy to reward their supporters with the lands of the local opponents. 

Finally, there was the long-standing difficulty involving the Catholic Church, which culminated in the murder of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The problem for the King was that the Church acted like an &quot;imperium in imperio&quot;, a &quot;kingdom within a kingdom&quot;, only partially, if at all, subject to Henry&#x27;s laws. The church operated its own court system, which answered not to Henry but to the Pope; it was a large landowner and a powerful vested interest. Henry wished to establish a system of justice that would enlarge the power of the Crown at the expense of the clergy.

==The assizes==
Henry, therefore, promulgated various assizes (i.e. courts that convened in a town periodically, rather than being permanently established). The primary and most general one, the Assize of Clarendon was issued in 1166. Others, the &quot;petty&quot; assizes known respectively as the assize of novel disseisin, of mort d&#x27;ancestor, and of darrein presentment gave more specific relief. The most popular one became the &quot;assize of novel disseisin&quot;, which in Law French meant something close to the &quot;assize of recent dispossession&quot;. Those who had been recently put out of their lands could recover the beneficial use of them by resorting to this assize, which led to a then-innovative method of trial. Twelve &quot;of the more lawful men&quot; of the locality were summoned by the king&#x27;s sheriff to determine, upon their own knowledge, who was entitled to the property. This innovative method of proceeding, the origin of the civil petit jury at common law, was aimed at the chaos introduced into property rights by crusade and civil war.

Henry&#x27;s true measure of cleverness, though, is on display in his innovations in criminal justice. Henry appointed &quot;justices in eyre&quot;, the counterpart of circuit judges, to travel from town to town. When they arrived, they too called upon the sheriff to summon twelve free men from the surrounding areas. These twelve free men were a prototype of a grand jury. They were called to report under oath any accusations of crime they were aware of in the community. In theory, then as (in the United States and Liberia) now, the grand jury only brought accusations; it did not find guilt or innocence. The crimes to be investigated were specified in the Assize of Clarendon to be robbery, murder, or theft or anyone who had harboured a robber, murderer, or thief. To these the Assize of Northampton (1176) added counterfeiting, forgery, and arson. Minor crimes were specifically excepted so the new assizes concerned themselves with what would later be labeled &quot;felonies&quot;.

This new assize did away with the old form of trial known as &quot;compurgation&quot; in accusations brought by the grand jury. Under compurgation, an accused person who swore he did not commit the crime, and who found a sufficient number of his neighbours to swear that they believed him, was acquitted. Compurgation was no longer available in charges brought by the grand jury.

The only trial available to the defendant remained the traditional trial by ordeal, specifically in the Assize of Clarendon, &quot;the ordeal of water&quot;. Nevertheless, Henry did not put much faith in the results of the ordeal. The unfortunate felon who was convicted through the ordeal was typically executed. However, the Assize of Northampton (1176) provided that the loss of the right hand shall be added to a previous punishment of the loss of one foot for those who failed the ordeal. This implies that execution was not the inevitable result of a conviction. But even if the indicted culprit was acquitted in the ordeal, he was banished from the kingdom. In other words, the proceedings by the grand jury were the actual trial; everyone it accused was punished in some way, and the community was rid of the malefactor, one way or another, as adjudicated &quot;by the oath of twelve knights of the hundred—or, should knights not be present, by the oath of twelve lawful freemen&quot;.

==Effects of the assize==
These proceedings did much to transfer power out of the hands of local barons and into the hands of the royal court and its judges. In 1215, moreover, the Fourth Lateran Council forbade clergymen from participating in a trial by ordeal. After this date, trials after an indictment by the grand jury were conducted by juries as well.

The large changes wrought in the English system of justice did not go unchallenged. The dispute of jurisdiction over the one-sixth of the population of England who were clergy was the chief grievance between the king and Becket. Disgruntled peers attempted to undo Henry&#x27;s reforms by the Magna Carta forced on King John, but by that time the reforms had progressed too far—and their superiority over the system they had replaced was too obvious—for the forces of reaction to gain much ground. Henry II&#x27;s reforms laid the groundwork for the system of trials in common law.

<doc id="183716" wikidata="Q206820" url="?curid=183716" title="Anders Zorn">
<text>Anders Leonard Zorn (18 February 1860 – 22 August 1920) was a Swedish artist who attained international success as a painter, sculptor, and etching artist. His portrait subjects include King Oscar II of Sweden and three American Presidents: Grover Cleveland, William H. Taft, and Theodore Roosevelt. At the end of his life in 1920, he established the Swedish literary Bellman Prize.

==Family, education and travels==
Zorn was born and raised on his grandparents&#x27; farm in Yvraden, a hamlet near the village of Utmeland in the parish of Mora, Dalarna. He studied until the age of twelve in the school at Mora Strand before progressing in the autumn of 1872 to a secondary grammar school in Enköping.

From 1875 to 1880, Zorn studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, where he amazed his teachers with his talent. Members of the Stockholm Society approached him with commissions. In early 1881, Zorn met Emma Lamm, whose background was quite different from his. Emma Lamm was from a wealthy Jewish merchant family. She was interested in art and culture and, after a long engagement, they were married in a civil ceremony in October 1885. 

Zorn traveled extensively, to London, Paris, the Balkans, Spain, Italy, and the United States. During the 1890s in Paris, he spent much time with the Finn Albert Edelfelt. He became an international success and one of the most highly regarded painters of his era. It was primarily his skill as a portrait painter that gained Zorn international acclaim, based principally upon his incisive ability to depict the individual character of his model. His subjects included three American Presidents: Grover Cleveland, William H. Taft, and Theodore Roosevelt.

==Honors==
At the age of 29, he was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur at the Exposition Universelle 1889 Paris World Fair.

==Collection==
Zorn&#x27;s art made him wealthy and he was thus able to build up a considerable collection of art. The objects were not only bought in his native country but also during the many travels he made abroad. In their joint will, Anders and Emma Zorn donated their entire holdings to the Swedish State.

Some of his most important works can be seen at the National Museum of Fine Arts (Swedish: &quot;Nationalmuseum&quot;) in Stockholm. Among them is &quot;Midsummer Dance&quot; (1897), a depiction of dancers in the evening light of a rural Midsummer&#x27;s Eve celebration. Other museums holding major works by Zorn include the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The Zorn Collections (Swedish: &quot;Zornsamlingarna&quot;) located in Mora and Garberg, Älvdalen, consist of four museums dedicated to the life and works of Anders Zorn. The main museum – Zornmuseet – was designed by Ragnar Östberg and opened in 1939. Shown there are extensive works of Zorn and his collected art by Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn, &#x27;The Hovingham Master&#x27; (Poussin&#x27;s follower), Bruno Liljefors, Albert Edelfelt, and Pehr Hilleström.

The Bellman Prize (Bellmanpriset) is a literature prize for &quot;an outstanding Swedish poet&quot;, every year awarded by the Swedish Academy. The prize was established by Anders Zorn and his wife Emma in 1920.

==Zorngården==
In 1886, Anders Zorn and his wife, Emma, bought land close to Mora church and here they moved to a cottage from his maternal grandfather&#x27;s farm. When Anders and Emma Zorn decided to return to Sweden after several years abroad, they began to enlarge the cottage. Zorngården, the Zorn combined smallholding, farmstead, and residence, was completed in 1910.

Zorngården remains today much as it was at the time of Emma Zorn&#x27;s death in 1942. It is a fine example of an artist&#x27;s home from the early years of the 20th century. With inspiration from English and Swedish architecture, it is today an excellent example of the architectural freedom that characterizes the years around 1900.

The main part of Zorngården consists of Zorn&#x27;s home and a museum with his art, but there are two other museums that also are part of the Zorn Collections. Gammelgården is in the southern part of Mora and consists of some 40 timber houses that Zorn bought to make sure that the old art of building such houses would not be forgotten. Gopsmor, Zorn&#x27;s refuge when under stress, is in the municipality of Älvdalen and is only open for visitors in July.

==Paintings==
While his early works were often watercolors, by 1887 he had switched firmly to oils. Zorn was a prolific artist. He became an international success as one of the most acclaimed portrait painters of his era. His sitters included three American Presidents, nobility, the Swedish king and queen, and numerous members of high society. Zorn also painted portraits of family members, friends, and self-portraits. Zorn is also noted for his nude paintings. His fondness of painting full-figured women gave rise to the terms &quot;Zornkulla&quot; or dalkulla, an unmarried woman or girl from Dalarna, as the women were called in the local dialect of the region where Zorn lived.

== Palette ==
Zorn was known to use a basic color palette consisting of Lead White (Flake White), Yellow Ochre, Vermilion, and Ivory Black. This limited color palette shows tremendous range in terms of color mixing. A large variety of tonal ranges is possible using this palette, a very important development for portrait painting. The color palette can also be used in still life and landscape painting under certain circumstances. The most striking aspect is that an olive greenish color is possible to obtain by mixing Ivory Black with Yellow Ochre, as Ivory Black is bluish in nature.

<text>The Guiana Space Centre (; CSG), also called Europe&#x27;s Spaceport, is a spaceport to the northwest of Kourou in French Guiana, an overseas region of France in South America. Kourou is located approximately north of the equator at a latitude of 5°. In operation since 1968, it is a suitable location for a spaceport because of its near equatorial location and open sea to the east and north.

At CSG, space launches are conducted by several European private companies and government agencies working together. The CSG land itself is managed by CNES, the French national space agency. The launch infrastructure built on the CSG land is owned by the European Space Agency. The private company Arianespace operates the launches including planning missions, handing customer relationships and overseeing the team at CSG at that integrates and prepares vehicles for launch. The rockets themselves are designed and produced by other companies, ArianeGroup for the Ariane 6 and Avio for the Vega.

== History ==
In 1964, Guiana was selected to become the spaceport of France, replacing France&#x27;s first launch site Centre interarmées d&#x27;essais d&#x27;engins spéciaux in Hammaguir (Algeria) after Algeria&#x27;s independence, moving to and expanding in Guiana colonization. In 1975, France offered to share Kourou with the ESA, with ESA covering today two thirds of Guiana Space Centre&#x27;s budget. Commercial launches are also bought by non-European companies. ESA pays two-thirds of the spaceport&#x27;s annual budget and has also financed the upgrades made during the development of the Ariane launchers.

On 4 April 2017, the center was occupied by 30 labour unions and indigenous peoples leaders in the midst of the 2017 social unrest in French Guiana. The center resumed operation on 24 April 2017, after an emergency relief plan of up to 2.1 billion euros was authorized by the French government.

== Facilities ==
The location of the space centre was selected based on various factors. One of the primary benefits of this spaceport is its proximity to the equator, which makes it more efficient, requiring substantially less energy, to launch spacecraft into an near-equatorial, geostationary orbit compared to launching from spaceports at higher latitudes.

Additionally, the centre&#x27;s location adjacent to the open sea to the east reduces the potential risk of rocket stages and debris from launch failures falling on or near human settlements, which enhances safety during spaceflight activities.

Furthermore, rockets typically launch towards the east to take advantage of Earth&#x27;s rotation and the angular momentum it provides. The near-equatorial location of the Guiana Space Centre offers an advantage for launches to low-inclination or geostationary Earth orbits, as rockets can be launched into orbits with an inclination of as low as 6°. In contrast, a rocket launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, with a latitude of 28.5°, can only be launched to an inclination of 28.5°, requiring a significant amount of propellant to change the inclination.

The location of the Guiana Space Centre provides benefits for launching spacecraft into low-inclination or geostationary Earth orbits. Rockets of similar size to those used at other spaceports to place satellites into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), such as the Proton and Ariane 5 rockets, can send similar payloads to a low Earth orbit (LEO). For example, the Proton rocket, launched from high latitudes in Russia, can only send 6,270kg to GTO, while the Kourou-launched Ariane 5 can send more than 10,000kg to GTO.

=== ALD/ELM ===

In 1969 a launch pad for the Diamant rocket was built. The first launch took place in 1970, which was also the first satellite launch from Kourou. More launches followed, but the pad was decommissioned in 1975.

Beginning 2019 the pad is being reactivated. Multiple companies have announced that they would be using the pad for microlaunchers. Among them are Isar Aerospace, Rocket Factory Augsburg, ArianeGroup, PLD Space, Latitude, HyImpulse and Avio with their Spectrum, RFA One, Callisto, Themis, Miura 5, Zephyr and SL1 rockets. The pad will then be renamed ELM (Ensemble de Lancement Multilanceurs). It is likely that PLD space will first use the pad in 2025.

=== BEC/ELA-1/ELV ===
Originally built in the 1960s under the name of &quot;Base Équatoriale du CECLES&quot; (), the pad was designed for the Europa-II launch vehicle. One Europa-II was launched from the site in 1971, which ended in failure due to a guidance problem, before the program was cancelled.

The pad at Guiana was demolished and subsequently rebuilt as the first launch complex for Ariane as ELA (). Redesignated later as &quot;ELA-1&quot;, it was used for Ariane 1 and Ariane 2 and 3 launches until being retired in 1989.

In November 2001, it was refurbished again for the Vega rocket and renamed ELV (). The first launch was on 13 February 2012.

=== ELA-2 ===

The ELA-2 pad (), built in 1986, had been used for Ariane 4 launches from 1988 until 2003. Before 1988, although purpose-built for &quot;Ariane 4&quot;, the pad hosted an &quot;Ariane-2&quot; and two &quot;Ariane-3&quot; launches. The complex consisted of two areas: the launcher preparation zone and the launch pad, separated by one kilometre, allowing a launcher to be assembled in the preparation zone while another launch from the pad. A mobile service tower at the launch pad provided a protected environment for payload installation and final preparation of the rocket. Following the retirement of the Ariane 4 in favor of the Ariane 5, In September 2011, the pad&#x27;s service tower was demolished using explosives.

=== ELA-3 ===
ELA-3 () was active between 4 June 1996 and 5 July 2023, launching the Ariane 5. This facility covers an area of .

In the future the site will be adapted by Avio for Vega-E launches.

=== ELA-4 ===
ELA4 is located along the &quot;Route de l&#x27;Espace&quot; in the Roche Christine site between the ELA-3 and ELS launch facilities. CNES was responsible for the construction of the Ariane 6 ground segments including the new launch pad. Earthworks on the 150 hectare launch site began at the end of June 2015 and was completed at the start of 2016. Four platforms were levelled to accommodate the launch pad, the liquid oxygen and hydrogen tanks and the assembly building. Civil engineering works on the flame trench and other buildings began in the summer of 2016 and ended in 2019. The new launch facility was inaugurated on 28 September 2021 with first flight of the Ariane 6 conducted on 9 July 2024.

=== ELS / Soyuz at CSG ===
ESA has built ELS () for launching Russian-built Soyuz-2 rockets. The first Soyuz launch from ELS was postponed several times, but launched on 21 October 2011.

ELS is located on the territory of Sinnamary commune, from Kourou harbor. It is northwest of the site used for the Ariane 5 launches. Under the terms of the Russo-European joint venture, ESA will augment its own launch vehicle fleet with Soyuz rockets – using them to launch ESA or commercial payloads – and the Russians will get access to the Kourou spaceport for launching their own payloads with Soyuz rockets. Russia will use the Guiana Space Centre in addition to Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Guiana location has the significant benefit of greatly increased payload capability, owing to the near equatorial position. A Soyuz rocket with a 1.7 tones to geostationary transfer orbit performance from Baikonur will increase its payload potential to 2.8 tones from the Guiana launch site.

The ELS project is being co-funded by Arianespace, ESA, and the European Union, with CNES being the prime contractor. The project has a projected cost of approximately €320 million, where €120 million are allocated for modernizing the Soyuz vehicle. The official opening of the launch site construction occurred on 27 February 2007.

On 13 September 2010, Spaceflight Now reported that after several delays in the construction of a mobile gantry the launch pad had been finished, and the first flight of the Soyuz was expected to occur in early 2011. By October 2010, 18 launch contracts were signed. Arianespace has ordered 24 launchers from Russian industry.

On 21 October 2011, two Galileo IOV-1 and IOV-2 satellites were launched using a Soyuz-ST rocket, in the &quot;first Russian Soyuz vehicle ever launched from Europe&#x27;s Spaceport in French Guiana.&quot;.

On 26 February 2022, Roscosmos announced that it was suspending operations at ELS as a reaction to international sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War. According to Stephane Israël, CEO of Arianespace, &quot;there will no longer be Soyuz launches&quot; from the Guiana Space Center.

In April 2024 CNES put out a call to take over the launch pad. In September the same year MaiaSpace was chosen to use the pad for their two-stage Maia rocket. The company want to invest tens of millions of euros and aims for an inaugural launch in late 2025. ESA retains a right to select another company of their European Launch Challenge to also use the pad.

=== Final assembly building ===
Astrium assembles each Ariane 5 launcher in the Launcher Integration Building. The vehicle is then delivered to the Final Assembly Building for payload integration by Arianespace. The Final Assembly Building is located from the ELA-3 launch zone. The mobile launch table completes the trip with an Ariane 5 in about one hour. It is then secured in place over the launch pad&#x27;s flame ducts.

== Launches ==

=== Launch safety ===
Fire safety is ensured by a detachment of the Paris Fire Brigade, a branch of the French Army. Security around the base is ensured by French Gendarmerie forces, assisted by the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment of the French Foreign Legion. Before and during launch windows, CSG facility security is significantly enhanced by anti-personnel and anti-aircraft measures, the exact configurations of which are classified by the French military. All entrants to the launch complex are also subject to checks for proof of permission to enter the facility.

The Guiana Space Centre (as per CNES) also contains the &quot;Îles du Salut&quot;, a former penal colony including the infamous Devil&#x27;s Island. Now a tourist site, the islands are under the launching trajectory for geosynchronous orbit and have to be evacuated during launches.

=== Early launches ===
* 10 March 1970 – The first Diamant-B launched the DIAL/MIKA and DIAL/WIKA satellites. DIAL/MIKA failed during launch, but it entered orbit with a total mass of 111 kg. DIAL/WIKA provided data for about two months after launch.

== Local impact ==

The space sector was responsible for about 15% of French Guiana&#x27;s GDP in 2014, around half of the 28% it was in 1990. This reduction is mostly due to expansion in other sectors, rather than decreasing space activity. As of 2020, the space sector employed 4,620 people in Guiana, meaning the industry was responsible for just under 10% of salaried jobs in the overseas department, though there are estimates that as many as 9,000 people are employed directly and indirectly as a result of activities at the spaceport. The Guiana Space Centre (or CSG) is one of the spaceports in the world that receives the most traffic, and it receives large amounts of funding from the European Space Agency (ESA), with the organisation covering around 66% of the spaceport&#x27;s annual budget, as well as financing new facilities. Indigenous and local activist groups argue that mainland France is only interested in French Guiana as far as the space centre is concerned, and the funding that the space centre receives is symbolic given the inequity in living standards seen between the department and mainland France. For example, despite there being high poverty levels and unemployment rates of over 20% in the department, the cost of living remains high due to a dependence on mainland France for imported food and resources, yet large amounts of funding are invested in the space programme, rather than in public services for the department.

The department became the site of strikes and protests throughout March and April 2017, which were held to highlight the insecurity and infrastructural issues facing French Guiana. Alongside 30 labour unions who launched strikes, the Collective of 500 Brothers led protests in Kourou, which spread across the entire country, and resonated in mainland France. On 21 March 2017, the launch of an Ariane 5 rocket carrying a Brazilian satellite and a South Korean satellite was prevented due to protesters and workers on strike from the CSG blockading the centre. Further strikes and occupation of the space centre meant that the satellites were not launched until May 2017. Negotiations between the French government and Guianese protesters resulted in a rejection of a €1.1 billion offer made by the French, with the Guianese demanding at least €3 billion in aid. Since the protests, CNES (National Centre for Space Studies), the French government space agency that operates the spaceport, added an additional €10 million to the €40 million it had already pledged to fund economic and social programmes in French Guiana.

===Environment===
Space launches have increased aluminium concentrations around the site.

===Colonialism===
Particularly regarding the colonial history the site has been identified as carrying a heritage of colonialism and imperialism into space.

<text>The Ilyushin Il-2 (Russian: Илью́шин Ил-2) is a ground-attack plane that was produced by the Soviet Union in large numbers during the Second World War. The word &quot;shturmovík&quot; (Cyrillic: штурмовик), the generic Russian term for a ground-attack aircraft, became a synecdoche for the Il-2 in English sources, where it is commonly rendered Shturmovik, Stormovik and Sturmovik.

To Il-2 pilots, the aircraft was known by the diminutive &quot;Ilyusha&quot;. To the soldiers on the ground, it was called the &quot;Hunchback&quot;, the &quot;Flying Tank&quot; or the &quot;Flying Infantryman&quot;. Its postwar NATO reporting name was Bark.

During the war, 36,183 units of the Il-2 were produced, and in combination with its successor, the Ilyushin Il-10, a total of 42,330 were built, making it the single most produced military aircraft design in aviation history, as well as one of the most produced piloted aircraft in history along with the American postwar civilian Cessna 172 and the German then-contemporary Messerschmitt Bf 109.

The Il-2 played a crucial role on the Eastern Front. When factories fell behind on deliveries, Joseph Stalin told the factory managers that the Il-2s were &quot;as essential to the Red Army as air and bread.&quot;

==Design and development==

===Origins===
The idea for a Soviet armored ground-attack aircraft dates to the early 1930s, when Dmitry Pavlovich Grigorovich designed TSh-1 and TSh-2 armored biplanes. However, Soviet engines at the time lacked the power needed to provide the heavy aircraft with good performance. The Il-2 was designed by Sergey Ilyushin and his team at the Central Design Bureau in 1938. TsKB-55 was a two-seat aircraft with an armoured shell weighing , protecting crew, engine, radiators, and the fuel tank. Standing loaded, the Ilyushin weighed more than , making the armoured shell about 15% of the aircraft&#x27;s gross weight. Uniquely for a World War II attack aircraft, and similarly to the forward fuselage design of the World War I-era Imperial German Junkers J.I armored, all-metal biplane, the Il-2&#x27;s armor was designed as a load-bearing part of the Ilyushin&#x27;s monocoque structure, thus saving considerable weight. The prototype TsKB-55, which first flew on 2 October 1939, won the government competition against the Sukhoi Su-6 and received the VVS designation BSh-2 (the BSh stood for &quot;Bronirovani Shturmovik&quot; or armoured ground attack). The prototypes – TsKB-55 and TskB-57 – were built at Moscow plant #39, at that time the Ilyushin design bureau&#x27;s base.

The BSh-2 was overweight and underpowered, with the original Mikulin AM-35 engine designed to give its greatest power outputs at high altitude. Because of this, it was redesigned as the TsKB-57, a lighter single-seat design with the more powerful Mikulin AM-38 engine, a development of the AM-35 optimised for low-level operation. The TsKB-57 first flew on 12 October 1940. The production aircraft passed State Acceptance Trials in March 1941, and was redesignated Il-2 in April. Deliveries to operational units commenced in May 1941.

The armament of Il-2 was subject to a competition. One of the first 1940 photographs of the Il-2 show it equipped with two MP-6 23 mm autocannons developed by Yakov Taubin (&quot;Яков Таубин&quot;) at OKB-16. The MP-6 gun weighed and developed an initial muzzle velocity of . It operated on the short recoil principle and had a rate of fire of about 600 rpm. (The development of the MP-6 gun can be traced back to 1937. The initial version was tested in the spring of 1940 on a Messerschmitt Bf 110 bought from Germany, because there was no suitable Soviet aircraft on which to mount it. In the summer of 1940 it was tested on the Pashinin I-21.) Factory trials of the MP-6 gun on the Il-2 were conducted in August 1940. In the early Il-2 prototypes, these guns were fed by 81-round clips. In flight, these clips sometimes became dislodged because of their large surface, which caused them to experience significant aerodynamic pressure. Competitive tests were conducted in the spring of 1941 between the MP-6 gun modified to belt-fed and the newly developed, gas-operated Volkov-Yartsev VYa-23, which had otherwise rather similar characteristics. The VYa-23 was declared the winner at this trial. Subsequently, in May 1941, development of the MP-6 gun was terminated. Taubin was arrested and summarily executed in October that year for plotting to continue production of his failed weapon.

===Technical description===
The Il-2 is a single-engine, propeller-driven, low-wing monoplane of mixed construction with a crew of two (one in early versions), specially designed for assault operations. Its most notable feature was the inclusion of armor in an airframe load-bearing scheme. Armor plates replaced the frame and paneling throughout the nacelle and middle part of the fuselage, and an armored hull made of riveted homogeneous armor steel AB-1 (AB-2) secured the aircraft&#x27;s engine, cockpit, water and oil radiators, and fuel tanks.

===Production===
In early 1941, the Il-2 was ordered into production at four factories, and was eventually produced in greater numbers than any other military aircraft in aviation history, but by the time Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, only State Aviation Factory No. 18 at Voronezh and Factory No. 381 at Leningrad had commenced production, with 249 having been built by the time of the German attack.

Production early in the war was slow because after the German invasion the aircraft factories near Moscow and other major cities in western Russia had to be moved east of the Ural Mountains. Ilyushin and his engineers had time to reconsider production methods, and two months after the move Il-2s were again being produced. The tempo was not to Premier Stalin&#x27;s liking, however, and he issued the following telegram to Shenkman and Tretyakov:

As a result, &quot;the production of Shturmoviks rapidly gained speed. Stalin&#x27;s notion of the Il-2 being &#x27;like bread&#x27; to the Red Army took hold in Ilyushin&#x27;s aircraft plants, and the army soon had their Shturmoviks available in quantity.&quot;

State Aviation Factory No. 1, which was evacuated from Moscow to Kuibyshev (now Samara), came online in October 1941 and would ultimately produce 11,863 Il-2s over four years while also producing smaller numbers of MiG-3s and the Il-2s successor, the Il-10, at the same factory.

==Operational history==
===Initial use and operational confusion===
The first use in action of the Il-2 was with the 4th ShAP (Ground Attack Regiment) over the Berezina River days after German invasion began. The aircraft was so new that the pilots had no training in flight characteristics or tactics, and the ground crew no training in servicing or re-arming. The training received enabled the pilots only to take-off and land; none of the pilots had fired the armament, let alone learned tactics. There were 249 Il-2s available on 22 June 1941. In the first three days, 4th ShAP had lost 10 Il-2s to enemy action, a further 19 were lost to other causes, and 20 pilots were killed.
By 10 July, 4th ShAP was down to 10 aircraft from a strength of 65.

===New tactics===
Tactics improved as Soviet aircrews became used to the Il-2&#x27;s strengths. Instead of a low horizontal straight approach at altitude, the target was usually kept to the pilot&#x27;s left and a turn and shallow dive of 30 degrees was used, using an echeloned assault by four to twelve aircraft at a time. Although the Il-2&#x27;s RS-82 and RS-132 rockets could destroy armored vehicles with one hit, they were so inaccurate that experienced Il-2 pilots mainly used the cannon. Another potent weapon of the Il-2 were high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shaped charge bomblets named &quot;protivotankovaya aviabomba&quot; (PTAB, &quot;anti-tank aviation bomb&quot;). They were designated PTAB-2.5-1.5, as they had a total weight of , and an explosive charge of . Up to 192 were carried in four external dispensers (cluster bombs) or up to 220 in the inner wing panels&#x27; internal ventral weapon bays. The charge could easily penetrate the relatively thin upper armor of all heavy German tanks. PTABs were first used on a large scale in the Battle of Kursk with little success, perhaps due to the poor bombing accuracy of the Il-2.

The Il-2 was thereafter deployed widely on the Eastern Front. The aircraft could fly in low light conditions and carried weapons able to defeat the thick armor of the Panther and Tiger I tanks.

===Effectiveness as attack aircraft===

The true capabilities of the Il-2 are difficult to determine from existing documentary evidence. W. Liss in &quot;Aircraft profile 88: Ilyushin Il-2&quot; mentions an engagement during the Battle of Kursk on 7 July 1943, in which 70 tanks from the German 9th Panzer Division were claimed to be destroyed by Ilyushin Il-2s in just 20 minutes. In another report of the action on the same day, a Soviet staff publication states that:
In the Battle of Kursk (Operation Citadel), General V. Ryazanov became a master in the use of attack aircraft &quot;en masse&quot;, developing and improving the tactics of Il-2 operations in co-ordination with infantry, artillery and armored troops. Il-2s at Kursk used the &quot;circle of death&quot; tactic: up to eight Shturmoviks formed a defensive circle, each plane protecting the one ahead with its forward machine guns, while individual Il-2s took turns leaving the circle, attacking a target, and rejoining the circle. Ryazanov was later awarded the Gold Star of Hero of Soviet Union twice, and the 1st Assault Aviation Corps under his command became the first unit to be awarded the honorific title of Guards.
In 1943, one aircraft was lost for every 26 Shturmovik sorties. About half of those lost were shot down by fighters, the rest falling to anti-aircraft fire.

Other studies of the fighting at Kursk suggest that very few of German armour losses were caused by the IL-2 or any other Soviet aircraft. In fact, total German tank losses in Operation Citadel amounted to 323 destroyed, the vast majority by anti-tank guns and armored fighting vehicles. In addition, it is difficult to find any first-hand accounts by German panzer crews on the Eastern Front describing anything more than the occasional loss to direct air attack. The vast majority, around 95–98%, of tank losses were due to enemy anti-tank guns, tanks, mines, artillery, and infantry assault, or simply abandonment as operational losses (due to causes such as mechanical breakdown or running out of fuel), which mostly happened during the last eleven months of the war.

During the Battle of Kursk, VVS Il-2s claimed the destruction of no less than 270 tanks (and 2,000 men) in a period of just two hours against the 3rd Panzer Division. On 1 July, however, the 3rd Panzer Division&#x27;s 6th Panzer Regiment had just 90 tanks, 180 fewer than claimed as destroyed. On 11 July (well after the battle), the 3rd Panzer Division still had 41 operational tanks. The 3rd Panzer Division continued fighting throughout July, mostly with 48th Panzer Corps. It did not record any extraordinary losses to air attack throughout this period. As with the other panzer divisions at Kursk, the large majority of the 3rd Panzer Division&#x27;s tank losses were due to dug-in Soviet anti-tank guns and tanks.

Perhaps the most extraordinary claim by the VVS&#x27;s Il-2s is that, over a period of four hours, they destroyed 240 tanks and in the process virtually wiped out the 17th Panzer Division. On 1 July, the 17th Panzer Division had only one tank battalion (the II./Pz Rgt 39), with 67 tanks, 173 fewer than claimed destroyed by the VVS. The 17th Panzer Division was not even in the main attack sector, but further south with the 1st Panzer Army&#x27;s 24th Panzer Corps. The 17th Panzer did not register any abnormal losses due to aircraft in the summer of 1943, and retreated westwards with Army Group South later in the year, still intact.

The main problem with the Il-2 was the inaccuracy of its attacks. Towards the end of war, the Soviets were able to concentrate large numbers of Shturmoviks to support their main offensives. The effect, however, was often more psychological than actual physical destruction of targets, particularly against dug-in and armored targets. In the 9 June offensive in the Karelian Isthmus in Finland, Finnish anti-aircraft forces were far too few in number to counter the armadas of Pe-2 and Il-2, but quickly found that the Il-2 attacks generally missed their marks widely, particularly with bombs. While some attacks against large unprotected targets such as horse and truck convoys and railyards had devastating results, attacks against dug-in point targets were usually ineffective. The frequent duels between dug-in 20 and 40 mm AA guns and Il-2 attackers never resulted in the complete destruction of the gun, while many Il-2s were brought down in these attacks.

The heavy armor of the Il-2 also meant that it would typically carry only comparatively light bomb-loads, which together with the poor accuracy of its attacks made it a far less deadly attack aircraft than contemporary Allied fighter-bombers such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and Hawker Typhoon. The rocket projectiles especially were not effective, even the larger RS-132 (of which four were carried) having a warhead with only of explosives, which compared poorly with the P-47&#x27;s typical load of ten HVARs, each having of explosives, or the eight to twelve RP-3 rockets on the Hawker Typhoon, each with of explosives. Likewise, the Shturmovik&#x27;s bombs were usually only , or rarely , too small to compensate for the typically wide variation from the target point.
To compensate for the poor accuracy of the Il-2&#x27;s bombsight, in 1943, the Soviet Command decided to use shaped-charge armor-piercing projectiles against enemy armored vehicles, and the PTAB-2.5-1.5 SCAP aircraft bomb was put into production. These small-calibre bombs were loaded directly into the bomb bays and were dropped onto enemy vehicles from altitudes up to . As each Il-2 could carry up to 192 bombs, a &quot;fire carpet&quot; long and wide could cover the enemy tanks, giving a high &quot;kill&quot; probability.
Pilots of 291st ShAP were the first to use the PTAB-2.5-1.5 bombs. During one sortie on 5 June 1943, six attack aircraft led by Lt. Col. A. Vitrook destroyed 15 enemy tanks in one attack, and during five days of the enemy advance, the 291st Division claimed to have destroyed or damaged 422 enemy tanks.

===The &quot;flying tank&quot;===
Thanks to the heavy armor protection, the Il-2 could take a great deal of punishment and proved difficult for both ground and aircraft fire to shoot down.

A major threat to the Il-2 was German ground fire. In postwar interviews, Il-2 pilots reported and artillery as the primary threat. While the fabled calibre gun was formidable, low-flying Il-2s presented too fast-moving a target for the 88&#x27;s relatively low rate of fire, only occasional hits were scored. Similarly, Finnish attempts to counter the Il-2 during the summer of 1944 proved ineffective as a result of the low numbers of AA in the field army. Heavier guns drawn from homeland defence proved also relatively ineffective and few Il-2s were downed despite attempting different tactics with time-fused fragmentation, contact-fused, and shrapnel ammunition: the heavy guns simply lacked the reaction times to take advantage of the brief firing opportunities presented by the low-altitude Il-2 attacks. Single-barrel 20 mm anti-aircraft guns were also found somewhat inadequate due to limited firepower: one or two shells were often not enough to destroy the Il-2, and unless the Il-2 was attacking the gun itself, thus presenting effectively a stationary target, scoring more hits during a firing opportunity was rare. 

The armored tub, ranging from in thickness and enveloping the engine and the cockpit, could deflect all small arms fire and glancing blows from larger-caliber ammunition. Unfortunately the rear gunners did not have the benefit of all-around armor protection, especially from the rear and to the sides, and suffered about four times the casualties of pilots. Added casualties resulted from the Soviet policy of not returning home with unused ammunition, which typically resulted in repeated passes on the target. Soviet troops often requested additional passes even after the aircraft were out of ammunition to exploit the intimidating effect Il-2s had on German ground troops, who gave it the nickname the &quot;flying tank&quot;. It was also called the &quot;black death&quot; by German troops. &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; pilots called it the &quot;Zementbomber&quot; (). The Finnish nickname &quot;maatalouskone&quot; ( or &#x27;tractor&#x27;) derived from a word play with &quot;maataistelukone&quot; &#x27;ground attack aircraft&#x27; (), where &#x27;machine&#x27; in turn is shortened from &#x27;aircraft&#x27; ().

===Rear gunner===

Heavy losses to enemy fighters forced the reintroduction of a rear gunner; early Il-2s were field modified by cutting a hole in the fuselage behind the cockpit for a gunner sitting on a canvas sling armed with a UBT machine gun in an improvised mounting. The semi-turret gun mount allowed the machine gun to be fired at angles of up to 35° upwards, 35° to starboard and 15° to port. Tests showed that maximum speed decreased by between and that the two-seater was more difficult to handle because the center of gravity was shifted backwards. At the beginning of March 1942, a production two-seat Il-2 with the new gunner&#x27;s cockpit began manufacturer tests. The second cockpit and armament increased all-up weight by so the flaps were allowed to be deployed at an angle of 17° to avoid an over-long takeoff run. The new variant had a lengthened fuselage compartment with an extended canopy offering some protection from the elements. Unlike the well-armoured cockpit of the pilot compartment with steel plating up to thick behind, beneath and on both sides as well as up to thick glass sections, the rear gunner was provided with thick armour, effective only against rifle-calibre rounds.

To improve performance, the Mikulin Design Bureau started work on an uprated AM-38 engine. The new engines produced at takeoff and at . They gave an improved takeoff and low-altitude performance. On 30 October 1942, production Il-2s powered by AM38s were used on the Central Front for the first time when they successfully attacked Smolensk airfield occupied by Germans. The &quot;Shturmovik&quot; rear guns proved to be effective against hostile fighters, and during the service trials alone, gunners shot down seven Bf 109s and repulsed many attacks. In January 1943, two-seat attack aircraft powered by uprated AM-38F engines (&quot;Forseerovannyy&quot; – uprated) began to arrive at front line units.

Nonetheless, the death rate among the air gunners remained exceptionally high and it was only for late models produced after 1944 that the rear plate of the armour shell was moved rearwards into the (wooden) rear fuselage to allow a gunner to sit behind the fuel tank. The armour did not extend to the rear or below although side armour panels were riveted to the rear armour plate to protect the ammunition tank for the UBT machine gun, providing some measure of protection. The modifications, including adding the rear gunner and gun, had added weight behind the center of gravity, resulting in &quot;marginal&quot; stability and handling characteristics that were &quot;barely acceptable&quot;. The need to shift the aerodynamic center of the aircraft forwards due to the weight of the added rear gunner and lengthened cockpit was the reason for the swept back outer wings in later Il-2s.

In February 1945, the highest scoring German flying ace to be killed in action, Otto Kittel, was shot down by return fire from an Il-2.

===Air-to-air combat===
Owing to a shortage of fighters, in 1941–1942, Il-2s were occasionally used as fighters. While outclassed by dedicated fighters such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190, in dogfights, the Il-2 could take on other &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft with some success. German front line units equipped with the Henschel Hs 126 suffered most of all from the ravages of Il-2s. Il-2 pilots also often attacked close formations of Junkers Ju 87s, as the machine guns of the &quot;Ju 87 Stukas&quot; were ineffective against the heavily armoured &quot;Shturmoviks&quot;. In the winter of 1941–1942, Il-2s were used against &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; transport aircraft, and became the most dangerous opponent of the Junkers Ju 52/3m. Pilots of 33rd GvShAP were the most successful in these operations. Other successful units were those in 1942–1943 operating near Stalingrad. Their targets were not only Ju 52s but also Heinkel He 111 and Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor bombers, delivering supplies to the besieged German troops.

While the Il-2 was a strong air-to-ground weapon, and even a fairly effective interceptor against slow bombers and transport aircraft, heavy losses resulted from its vulnerability to fighter attack. Losses were very high, the highest of all types of Soviet aircraft, though given the numbers in service this is only to be expected. &quot;Shturmovik&quot; losses (including the Il-10 type) in 1941–1945 were of 10,762 aircraft (533 in 1941, 1,676 in 1942, 3,515 in 1943, 3,347 in 1944 and 1,691 in 1945). The main defensive tactic was to fly low and reduce power as the enemy fighter closed in. This could make the fighter overshoot and fly into the Il-2&#x27;s firing zone.

During the Battle in Karelian Isthmus, Vyborg Offensive in summer 1944, Finnish 24th and 34th Fighter Squadrons and Luftwaffe II./JG 54 took a toll on Soviet Il-2 squadrons. In just 30 days (10 June – 9 July), Finnish and German fighter pilots shot down 111 and 53 Il-2s, respectively.

==Notable aircrew==
Senior Lieutenant Anna Yegorova piloted 243 Il-2 missions and was decorated three times. One of these awards was the Gold Star of Hero of the Soviet Union that Yegorova had received &quot;posthumously&quot; in late 1944, since she was presumed dead after being shot down. She survived imprisonment in a German POW camp.

Guards Junior Lieutenant Ivan Drachenko, another Il-2 pilot, was one of only four men awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and also a Full Cavalier of the Order of Glory as a recipient of each of the Order of Glory&#x27;s three classes. Despite having lost his right eye as a result of injuries sustained in a combat mission on 14 August 1943, he returned to flying status and continued to fly combat sorties until war&#x27;s end.

Recipient of the Hero of the Soviet Union award, T. Kuznetsov survived the crash of his Il-2 in 1942 when shot down returning from a reconnaissance mission. Kuznetsov escaped from the wreck and hid nearby. To his surprise, a German Bf 109 fighter landed near the crash site and the pilot began to investigate the wrecked Il-2, possibly to look for souvenirs. Thinking quickly, Kuznetsov ran to the German fighter and used it to fly home, barely avoiding being shot down by Soviet fighters in the process.

Lieutenant Colonel Nelson Stepanyan flew an Il-2 and took part in a number of aerial battles and bombing sorties. He was shot down once but returned to Soviet lines. On his final sortie in Liepāja, Latvia on 14 December 1944, his plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire, and although wounded, he flew his airplane into a German warship. Soviet sources assert that Stepanyan flew no fewer than 239 combat sorties, sank 53 ships, thirteen of which he did alone, destroyed 80 tanks, 600 armored vehicles, and 27 aircraft.

Cosmonaut Georgy Beregovoy flew the Ilyushin in 185 sorties, and was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union title in 1944. He was the earliest-born cosmonaut, and the only cosmonaut to be a Hero of the Soviet Union for an earlier achievement unrelated to space travel.

==Variants==
The early two-seater prototype proved to be too heavy for the limited power of the early Mikulin AM-35 engine. A redesigned single-seat version was soon developed and saw combat, particularly in the early phase of the war in the Soviet Union. While the Il-2 proved to be a deadly air-to-ground weapon, heavy losses were caused by its vulnerability to fighter attack. Consequently, in February 1942, the two-seat design was revived. The Il-2M, with a rear gunner under the stretched canopy, entered service in September 1942 with the surviving single-seaters eventually modified to this standard. Later changes included an upgrade from to cannons, aerodynamic improvements, use of wooden outer wing panels instead of metal and increased fuel capacity. In 1943, the Il-2 Type 3 or Il-2m3 came out with redesigned &quot;arrow-wings&quot; that possessed leading edges that were swept back 15 degrees on the outer panels, and nearly straight trailing edges, resulting in a wing planform somewhat like the AT-6 trainer. Performance and handling were much improved from the resulting shift of the Il-2&#x27;s aerodynamic center rearwards with the revised &quot;arrow wing&quot; planform to correct the earlier problem, and this became the most common version of the Il-2. A radial engine powered variant of the Il-2 with the Shvetsov ASh-82 engine was proposed in 1942 to remedy projected shortages in the Mikulin inline engines. However, the Shvetsov ASh-82 was also used in the new Lavochkin La-5 fighter which effectively secured all available engines to the Lavochkin bureau. The radial engine Sukhoi Su-2 ground attack aircraft was produced in small quantities, but was generally considered unsuitable due to inadequate performance and lack of defensive armament.

;Il-2 two-seat
:Two-seat version, AM-38 engine, first action on 30 October 1942 near Stalingrad. Maximum bomb load reduced from . Used on edges of flight formations for defense against German fighters. Quickly replaced by the &quot;Il-2 production of 1943&quot;.
;Il-2 production of 1943
:Referred in the west as the &quot;Il-2M&quot;. Powered by an upgraded AM-38F engine. Delivered to the front units from early 1943. In 1943, the 20 mm ShVAK armed Il-2s faded out, leaving only the 23 mm VYa variant.

;Il-2 with NS-37
:Referred in the west as the &quot;Il-2 Type 3M&quot;. Based on the two-seat Il-2, armed with Nudelman-Suranov NS-37 in conformal gun pods under the wings, instead of the 20/23 mm cannons, this version is an attempt to create an anti-tank aircraft, first used in combat during the Battle of Kursk. However, the combat effectiveness was quite low and production of the variant was limited to about 3,500. Moreover, bomb load was decreased from . It was replaced by the conventional Il-2 attackers armed with cassettes with cumulative bomblets.
;Il-2 production 1944 &quot;wing with arrow&quot;
:Referred in West as &quot;Il-2M3&quot; or &quot;Il-2 Type 3&quot;. As more duralumin became available for the Soviet aviation industry, the Il-2 received a set of all-metal wing panels. At the same time, the outer wing planform was swept back, with a straight trailing edge, since the centre of gravity was shifted rearwards after the gunner was added. The wing planform change regained controllability of the two-seat Il-2 back to level of the single-seat Il-2.
;Il-2U
:Training version, also known as UIl-2.
;Il-2T
:Torpedo bomber version for the Soviet Navy with the VYa-23 cannons removed to save weight, it was able to carry a single torpedo. Evidently, it was only a design as the 23rd Attack Air Regiment of the Black Sea Fleet flew regular Il-2M-3s fitted with torpedo racks as a field modification, and that no such aircraft were ever noted in the battle sortie logs.
;Il-2I
:Armoured fighter, prototype only. Concept based on several dogfights between Il-2 and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombers. Proved infeasible due to its low speed, which causes it to be able to intercept only older &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombers.
;Il-2R
:Il-2 fitted with a rocket motor in the rear, prototype only. The design was part of a concept to have units of Il-2R´s as part of a rapid response force, spread across the front to counter sudden counter-attacks. The rocket motor would aid in take-off and climbing, allowing the Il-2R´s to reach their target faster. The concept was abandoned before the go-ahead was given for production in 1945, as by then it was considered obsolete.
;Il-2 with M-82/M-82IR engine
:A backup project prepared while plants producing AM-35/AM-38 were evacuated. Compared to the original Il-2 it had additional armor, a rear gunner and Shvetsov ASh-82 or geared Ash-82IR engine. It had deteriorated rate of climb and field performance however it retained the same handling qualities. Recommended for production in Plant No.381 and Plant No.135, with 678 to be delivered by 1943. Cancelled because AM-38 production stabilized.

<text>BerliOS (short for &quot;Berlin Open Source&quot;) is a project founded by the Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems (FOKUS), Berlin, to coordinate the different interest groups in the field of open source software (OSS) and to assume a neutral coordinator function. The target groups of BerliOS were developers and users of open source software on the one side and OSS-related companies on the other. its website was still accessible, though hosting no projects.

== Overview ==
BerliOS consisted of several subprojects:
* &quot;DocsWell&quot;, a database for open source related documentation
* &quot;SourceWell&quot;, a news service for open source projects
* &quot;SourceLines&quot;, a &quot;best practice&quot; database for successful open source projects
* &quot;SourceBiz&quot;, a list of open source companies
* &quot;DevCounter&quot;, a database of open source developer profiles
* &quot;OpenFacts&quot;, a wiki-based open source knowledge database (using the MediaWiki software)
* &quot;SourceAgency&quot; (beta), a platform for coordinating open source funding

== Closure ==
The operators of the BerliOS project announced that BerliOS would close at the end of 2011 due to lack of sufficient funding and support. As the news of the pending closure spread, BerliOS received numerous rescue proposals. As a result, it was later announced that BerliOS would continue as a non-profit institute run by a combination of volunteers, donations and corporate sponsorship.

On February 23, 2012, BerliOS announced on their blog that a cooperation agreement had been signed with SourceForge, which meant that all projects hosted on BerliOS&#x27; systems would be automatically mirrored in new and separate projects on SourceForge. On April 4, 2012, SourceForge reiterated this statement on their blog and provided more specifics about the collaboration.

In January 2014 BerliOS announced that they would disable their hosting services on 30 April 2014.

<doc id="183728" wikidata="Q5193413" url="?curid=183728" title="Cultural subsidy">
<text>A cultural subsidy is a payment from the government to specific cultural industries to ensure that some public policy purpose in culture (e.g. multiculturalism, bilingualism, minority and languages, and preservation of traditional dance, music, food, art or other practices) are preserved and maintained in society. Cultural subsidies work similarly to other forms of subsidies such as industrial and consumer subsidies and have similar goals of expansionary economic results and increased utility for their targeted recipients.

==Implementation== 
Cultural subsidies are distributed in the form of grants and payment from the government to various institutions, groups or citizens who are seen to meaningfully contribute to their society&#x27;s culture. Some of the most familiar efforts are: free museum entrances for children and seniors, public art instalments, government funding for afterschool art-based programs and government grants to culturally focused non-profits.

A common emphasis for cultural subsidies is the provision of resources for underserved communities or groups, whose cultural background and heritage may be at risk without additional financial support, or who traditionally lack access to mainstream cultural events and participation. For example, the National Endowment for the Arts states that 40% of their activities support high-poverty neighbourhoods, 36% of their grants are awarded to organisations that serve those with disabilities, in institutions and veterans, while 33% of their grants are awarded to serve low-income audiences.

==Cultural subsidy implementation in the US==

The National Council for the Arts was established by US President Lyndon B. Johnson through the National Arts and Cultural Development Act of 1964 and is the US federal program which provides cultural subsidies. Its purpose is to review and recommend applications for grants, funding guidelines and leadership initiatives in the US. to the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. There are eighteen Presidentially appointed members of the council, with six additional members of Congress serving two-year, non-voting terms. Members are selected for their extensive knowledge, expertise and interest in the arts as well as outstanding backgrounds in service or recognition within the arts.

The annual budget for the National Council for the Arts is set by Congress and currently receives .004% of the total, or US$149.8 million. 40% of their grant budget is directly received by states via regional arts agencies who distribute the funds, with stipulations that every state and regional partnership allocates a portion of funding for underserved communities. Direct awards to organisations and individuals who apply through the National Endowment for the Arts make up the remaining 60% of their annual budget.

==Intended economic effects==

Like other subsidies, cultural subsidies are utilized with the intent to expand economic growth and utility within a specific area. The functionality of cultural subsidies can be seen through typical supply and demand graphs like those pictured below.

As prices for arts and culture related items, events and classes increase, the demand for them decreases. On the other hand, as prices increase, the supply also increases as more artists and cultural entities seek gains. Where the two forces of supply and demand meet is the equilibrium point (e1).

When cultural subsidies are applied from the demand-side that means they focus on growing the demand from consumers for art and culture related products. This most often is reflected in free or discounted ticket sales for art and culture events and purchases for pieces of art that consumers would otherwise not be able to buy due to budget constraints. The ultimate goal in utilising demand-side cultural subsidies is to increase the demand for art at every price level it is offered. Below, we can see the result is an outward shift of the demand curve to the right, and an increase in both the equilibrium supply &quot;and&quot; demand (e1 to e2). The difference from P1 to P2 is the amount which is compensated by the subsidy, and the total area of from P2, e2 and Q2 is the cultural sector&#x27;s revenue. Demand-side subsidies are typically viewed as an effective way to increase both the output of the cultural sector and increase incomes for the providers within it.

Governments can also approach cultural subsidies from the supply-side in an effort to increase the economic power of those who supply cultural products. This allows cultural providers the opportunity to produce and supply more than they would be able to without subsidised assistance. Instead of raising both the price and quantity of cultural products, as the demand-side subsidies do, supply-side subsidies lower price while increasing quantity, as show in the model below. Supply shifts downward, to the right and the new equilibrium moves from e1 to e2. Total revenue shifts from the blue rectangle to the red rectangle, which demonstrates an expansion of cultural sector output (Q1 to Q2), but not necessarily an increase in economic growth.

==Issues facing cultural subsidies==
As with other sectors reliant on subsidies, the cultural sector is constantly subject to the budget decisions made by the government. In the US, government subsidies for arts and culture have steadily been declining as spending emphasis shifts elsewhere. Cultural providers are forced to turn to state and private philanthropic groups and individuals for greater and greater percentages of their funding.

In 2017, the Donald Trump administration proposed to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, the US grant-making organization responsible for cultural subsidy provision. The main argument behind this comes from the private taxation of citizens to fund the program. Policymakers in favour of reduced taxes often view cultural subsidies as a non-necessary expense, and one which should be privately, versus publicly funded.

Opinions on the importance of cultural subsidies vary widely by each nation, as well as the levels of investment in cultural products by consumers and cultural professions by suppliers. In Australia, there is a current over-supply in the cultural sector which has been supported through supply-side subsidies from the government. This issue, paired with a drastic increase in the number of cultural professionals in the early 2000s, has been blamed for steadily declining salaries for cultural suppliers. Advocates for reform are stressing the importance of demand-side policies in the country as an alternative way to increase artist salary and most importantly, increase demand for the large supply of cultural products available.

<doc id="183729" wikidata="Q1237867" url="?curid=183729" title="Liberal Wars">
<text>The Liberal Wars (), also known as the War of the Two Brothers () and the Portuguese Civil War, was a war between liberal constitutionalists and conservative traditionalists in Portugal over royal succession that lasted from 1828 to 1834. Embroiled parties included the Kingdom of Portugal, Portuguese rebels, the United Kingdom, France, the Catholic Church, and Spain.

==Roots of the conflict==
The death of King John VI in 1826 created a dispute over royal succession. While Dom Pedro, the Emperor of Brazil, was the king&#x27;s oldest son, his younger brother Miguel contended that Pedro had forfeited his claim to the throne by declaring Brazilian independence and by declaring war on the Kingdom of Portugal, therefore violating the succession rules mentioned in the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom. Pedro briefly entitled himself King Pedro IV of Portugal. Neither the Portuguese nor the Brazilians wanted a unified monarchy; consequently, in 1826 Pedro revised the first constitution of Portugal granted in 1822 and abdicated the throne in favor of his daughter, Maria, a child of 7, while establishing his sister Isabel Maria as regent.

==A new constitution==
In the Portuguese Constitutional Charter, Pedro attempted to reconcile traditionalists and liberals by allowing both factions a role in the government. Unlike the Constitution of 1822, this new document established four branches of government. The Legislature was divided into two chambers. The upper chamber, the Chamber of Peers, was composed of life and hereditary peers and clergy appointed by the king. The lower chamber, the Chamber of Deputies, was composed of 111 deputies elected to four-year terms by the indirect vote of local assemblies, which in turn were elected by a limited suffrage of male tax-paying property owners. Judicial power was exercised by the courts; executive power by the ministers of the government; and moderative power by the king, who held an absolute veto over all legislation.

==Discontent==

The traditionalist party of the landowners and the Church, however, were not satisfied with this compromise, and they continued to regard Miguel as the legitimate successor to the throne on the grounds that according to the Portuguese succession rules (approved by the Cortes after the 1640 Restoration), Pedro had lost the right to the Portuguese crown, and therefore to choose a successor, when he took possession of a foreign crown (Brazil). They were alarmed by the liberal reforms that had been initiated in Spain by the detested Revolutionary French (reforms from which the Portuguese feudal aristocracy had been spared) and took heart at the recent restoration of the autocratic Ferdinand VII in Spain (1823) who was eradicating all the Napoleonic innovations. In February 1828, Miguel returned to Portugal, ostensibly to take the oath of allegiance to the Charter and assume the regency. He was immediately proclaimed king by his supporters, who pressed him to return to absolutism. A month after his return, Miguel dissolved the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers and, in May, summoned the traditional Cortes of the three estates of the realm to proclaim his accession to absolute power. The Cortes of 1828 assented to Miguel&#x27;s wish, proclaiming him king as Miguel I of Portugal and nullifying the Constitutional Charter.

==Rebellion==
This alleged usurpation did not go unchallenged by the Liberals. On May 18, the garrison in Porto, the center of Portuguese progressives, declared its loyalty to Pedro IV and his daughter Maria II, and the Constitutional Charter. The rebellion against the absolutists spread to other cities. Miguel suppressed these rebellions, and many thousands of Liberals were either arrested or fled to Spain and Britain. There followed five years of repression.

Meanwhile, in Brazil, relations between Pedro and Brazil&#x27;s agricultural magnates had become strained. In April 1831, Pedro abdicated in Brazil in favor of his son, Pedro II, and sailed for Britain. He organized a military expedition there and then went to Terceira island in the Azores, which was in the hands of the Liberals, to set up a government in exile. The government of Miguel blockaded the island, but the blockading squadron was attacked by a French squadron during the run-up to the Battle of the Tagus, where several Miguelist ships were captured. (Half of the liberal army consisted of French, British, Spanish and Belgian soldiers). In July 1832, with the backing of Liberals in Spain and Britain, an expedition led by Pedro landed near Porto, in the Landing at Mindelo, which the Miguelites abandoned and where, after military activities including the Battle of Ponte Ferreira, Pedro and his associates were besieged by Miguelite forces for nearly a year. To protect British interests, a naval squadron under Commander William Nugent Glascock in HMS &quot;Orestes&quot; was stationed in the Douro, where it came under fire from both sides.

In June 1833, the Liberals, still encircled at Porto, sent to the Algarve a force commanded by the Duke of Terceira supported by a naval squadron commanded by Charles Napier, using the alias &#x27;Carlos de Ponza&#x27;. The Duke of Terceira landed at Faro and marched north through the Alentejo to capture Lisbon on July 24. Meanwhile, Napier&#x27;s squadron encountered the absolutists&#x27; fleet near Cape Saint Vincent (&quot;Cabo São Vicente&quot;) and decisively defeated it at the fourth Battle of Cape St. Vincent. The Liberals were able to occupy Lisbon, where Pedro moved from Porto and repulsed a Miguelite siege. A stalemate of nine months ensued. Following the death of Ferdinand VII Spain changed sides and started to support the liberals. Towards the end of 1833, Maria da Glória was proclaimed queen, and Pedro was made regent. His first act was to confiscate the property of all who had served under King Miguel. He also suppressed all religious houses and confiscated their property, an act that suspended friendly relations with Rome for nearly eight years, until mid-1841. The absolutists controlled the rural areas, where they were supported by the aristocracy, and by a peasantry that was galvanized by the Church. The Liberals occupied Portugal&#x27;s major cities, Lisbon and Porto, where they commanded a sizable following among the middle classes. Operations against the Miguelites began again in earnest in early 1834, a year marked by the end of Spanish support which had changed sides to the liberals in 1833. Meanwhile, the Liberal army had suffered a sound defeat at Alcácer do Sal, which proved that, despite the Duke of Terceira&#x27;s recent march from Faro to Lisbon, the south was still loyal to the Miguelites. In the southernmost region of Continental Portugal, the region of Algarve, a man known as Remexido, hidden in the mountainous terrain around São Marcos da Serra, became a legend as a guerrilla loyal to the legitimist, antiliberal Miguelites until well after the end of the Liberal Wars.

==Peace==

The Battle of Asseiceira, fought on May 16, 1834, was the last and decisive engagement of the Portuguese Civil War. The Miguelist army was still formidable (about 18,000 men), but on May 26, 1834, at Evoramonte, to end the bloodbath in the country after six years of civil war a peace was declared under a concession by which Miguel formally renounced all claims to the throne of Portugal, was guaranteed an annual pension, and was definitively exiled. Pedro restored the Constitutional Charter, but he died September 24, 1834. In truth this was the &quot;official&quot; peace as Miguellist groups were still in action until the 1840s.

Maria da Glória resumed her interrupted reign as Maria II of Portugal.

<text>The Flowers of Romance was an early punk band, formed in mid-1976 by Jo Faull and Sarah Hall, girlfriends at the time of Steve Jones and Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols. The band did not release any recordings and, like London SS and Masters of the Backside, are more famed for the number of band members that later became well known, including: Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, Keith Levene (an early member of The Clash and later of Public Image Ltd), Palmolive and Viv Albertine of The Slits, and Kenny Morris (future member of Siouxsie and the Banshees). Morris replaced Palmolive on drums in the last months of the band&#x27;s existence in late 1976. The band ended in January 1977 when Vicious joined Sex Pistols and Morris rehearsed with Siouxsie. Despite never playing live, they were interviewed by &quot;SKUM&quot; fanzine in which Sid Vicious proclaimed &quot;I&#x27;ll just be the yob that I am now&quot;.

The highly controversial song &quot;Belsen Was a Gas&quot;, about the Nazi concentration camp Bergen-Belsen, was written for this band by Vicious and Levene. It was performed live by the Sex Pistols, Public Image Ltd, and Sid Vicious&#x27; solo act. Viv Albertine wrote &quot;So Tough&quot; for the band, with the song eventually appearing on The Slits&#x27; debut album &quot;Cut&quot;.

The band&#x27;s name was suggested by Johnny Rotten, and subsequently became the title of an early Sex Pistols song, as well as a 1981 Public Image Ltd album and its title track.

<text>The 100 Club Punk Special (sometimes referred to as the 100 Club Punk Festival) was a two-day event held at the 100 Club venue in Oxford Street, London, England, on 20 and 21 September 1976. The gig showcased eight punk rock bands, most of which were unsigned. The bands in attendance were each associated with the then evolving punk rock music scene of the United Kingdom. Historically, the event has become seen as marking a watershed moment for punk rock, as it began to move from the underground and emerge into the music scene.

== Promotion ==
In early September 1976, concert promoter Ron Watts approached Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, the leaders of the new British punk rock scene, and proposed that they headline the event. After that, they presented the idea to the Damned and the Clash, both of which quickly agreed to participate. Siouxsie Sioux directly approached Watts and requested to join the line-up as well. McLaren then volunteered the French band Stinky Toys and a handful of other bands from Manchester.

The enthusiasm for this event was partly due to the very positive and extensive promotion by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; journalist Caroline Coon.

== The line-up ==
Monday evening, 20 September 1976
*Subway Sect
*Siouxsie and the Banshees
*The Clash
*Sex Pistols

Tuesday evening, 21 September 1976
*Stinky Toys
*Chris Spedding &amp; the Vibrators
*The Damned
*Buzzcocks

== Performances ==
The Vibrators were a new group that had only recently begun to write their own music and, at the encouragement of Ron Watts, they decided to act as backing band for established artist Chris Spedding for the show. Spedding, who had been booked to play the second night but didn&#x27;t have a band behind him, taught The Vibrators a few songs in the dressing room immediately prior the actual show, leaving no time for an actual rehearsal. Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; set, however, was completely improvisational. They didn&#x27;t know or play any songs, and their act had a purely &quot;performance art&quot; quality. Siouxsie, for instance, recited the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and similar memorised pieces of text.

None of the shows were rehearsed, says Ron Watts, &quot;It was just people, getting up and trying to do something.&quot;

== Attendees ==
Attendance at the event later become a badge of honour for punk rock fans, but it is probable that a lot of claims were apocryphal. Indeed, a great many people who were later to become involved in the punk scene claimed to have &quot;been there&quot; during the two-day festival, but this is unlikely to be true since the venue had only a 600-person capacity. However, amongst the verified attendees were: Paul Weller of the Jam, Shane MacGowan (later of the Nipple Erectors and the Pogues), Shanne Bradley (of the Nipple Erectors and the Men They Couldn&#x27;t Hang), Colin Newman of Wire, Viv Albertine of the Slits, Chrissie Hynde (later of the Pretenders), Jah Wobble (later of PiL), Vivienne Westwood (McLaren&#x27;s then partner and co-manager of the Chelsea boutique &quot;Sex&quot;), Kevin Haskins and his brother David J (later of Bauhaus), Gaye Advert and T. V. Smith (later of The Adverts), as well as members of the Bromley Contingent, the punk fashion &quot;avant-garde&quot;, Andrew Czezowski (ex-manager of the Damned) and Susan Carrington, who went on to start the Roxy with Barry Jones..

== Incident with Sid Vicious ==
The event was marred by violence when a beer glass, thrown by then Banshees drummer and later Sex Pistols bass player Sid Vicious during the Damned&#x27;s performance shattered against a pillar, blinding a young girl in one eye. Vicious was arrested shortly after the incident and spent several days in jail.
