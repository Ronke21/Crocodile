<text>Mount Lebanon (, ; , ; ) is a mountain range in Lebanon. It is about long and averages above in elevation, with its peak at . The range provides a typical alpine climate year-round.

Mount Lebanon is well-known for its snow-covered mountains, home to surviving Lebanese cedar forests and diverse high-altitude flora and fauna. The name Lebanon itself originates from the white, snow-covered tops of this mountain range.

==Geography==
The Mount Lebanon range extends along the entire country for about , parallel to the Mediterranean coast. The highest peak is Qurnat as Sawda&#x27;, at . The range receives a substantial amount of precipitation, including snow, which averages around in depth.

Lebanon has historically been defined by the mountains, which provided protection for the local population. In Lebanon, changes in scenery are related less to geographical distances than to altitudes. The mountains were known for their oak and pine forests. The last remaining old growth groves of the famous Cedar of Lebanon (&quot;Cedrus libani&quot; var. libanii&quot;) are on the high slopes of Mount Lebanon, in the Cedars of God World Heritage Site.

The Phoenicians used the forests of Mount Lebanon to build their ship fleet and to trade with their neighbors. The most notable example is the First Temple built by King Solomon who used cedar wood sent by Hiram of Tyre . Phoenicians and successor rulers consistently replanted and restocked the range; even as late as the 16th century, its forested area was considerable.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Mount Lebanon&quot; traces back to the Semitic root &quot;LBN&quot;, meaning &quot;white&quot;, likely a reference to the snow-covered mountains. In Strabo&#x27;s Geography, the mountain range is known as Libanus.

==History==
Mount Lebanon is mentioned in the Old Testament 103 times. King Hiram I of Tyre sent engineers with cedar wood, which was abundant in Mount Lebanon, to build the Solomon&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem. Since then, the cedar species known scientifically as &quot;Cedrus libani&quot; is often associated with Mount Lebanon. The Phoenicians used cedar to build ships in which they sailed the Mediterranean, thus they were the first to establish villages in Mount Lebanon and would live from cutting down cedars and sending them to the coast.

Eusebius records that the Emperor Constantine destroyed a temple of Venus on the summit of Mount Lebanon. After the 5th century AD, Christian monks who were followers of a hermit named Maron, arrived from the Orontes valley in Northern Syria and began preaching their religion to the inhabitants of the northernmost parts of the mountain range. In the late 8th century a group known as the Mardaites (also Jarajima) settled in North Lebanon following the order of the Byzantine Emperor; their mission was to raid Islamic territories in Syria. They merged with the local population, refusing to leave after the emperor struck a deal with the Muslim Caliph of Damascus; thus, they became part of the Maronite society. In 1291 after the fall of Acre, the last crusader outpost in the Levant, remnants of the European settlers who succeeded in escaping capture by the Mamelukes settled in the Northern part of Lebanon and become part of the Maronite society.

Mount Lebanon has been visited and called home by many Muslim ascetics and Sufis since the 7th century, mentioned by many travelers to the region, few of which are known by name such as Shiban al-Muallah and Abbas al-Majnun. In the 10th century, Twelver Shia Muslim communities were likely established in Keserwan and the adjacent area to the north when Shia Islam was in the ascendant in Tripoli and the Islamic world at large. In the 13th century, a significant Shia population dominated Keserwan stretching out as far north as Dinniyeh, where reportedly the Shia feudal lord family, the Hamadas, were entrusted with tax-collection in 1470. Subject to harsh military campaigns and state policies put forth by the Mamluks and Ottomans over the centuries, this Shia population decreased over time and was driven to settle in Southern Lebanon and the Bekaa valley, becoming a small minority in Mount Lebanon by the 19th century.

In the 9th century, tribes from the &quot;Jabal el Summaq&quot; area north of Aleppo in Syria began settling the southern half of the mountain range. These tribes were known as the Tanoukhiyoun and in the 11th century they converted to the Druze faith and ruled the areas of Mount Lebanon stretching from Metn in the north to Jezzine in the south. This entire area became known as the &#x27;Jabal ad-Duruz&#x27;. In the early 17th century, Emir Fakhr-al-Din II was entrusted as the main tax-collector and land-assigner in the Druze part of the mountains known as the Chouf. In an effort to re-populate the Chouf after the 1585 Ottoman expedition, Fakhreddine opened the door to Christians and in particular the Maronite settlement of the Chouf and Metn.

During the Ottoman era, the Qays–Yaman rivalry saw a resurgence in Mount Lebanon. The feud was mostly fought out between different Druze clans until the Battle of Ain Dara in 1711 led to the near complete exodus of Yamani Druze.

Throughout the 18th century and into the 19th century more and more Maronites settled in the Druze regions of the Mount. The Druze viewed these Maronite settlements as a threat to their power in Mount Lebanon and in a series of clashes in the 1840s and 1860s, a miniature civil war erupted in the area resulting in the massacre of thousands of Christians. The Druze won militarily, but not politically, because European powers (mainly France and Britain) intervened on behalf of the Maronites and divided Mount Lebanon into two areas; Druze and Maronite. Seeing their authority decline in Mount Lebanon, a few Lebanese Druze began migrating to the new Jabal ad-Duruz in southern Syria. In 1861, the &quot;Mount Lebanon&quot; autonomous district was established within the Ottoman system, under an international guarantee.

For centuries, the Maronites of the region have been protected by the noble Khazen family, which was endowed the responsibility by Pope Clement X and King Louis XIV and given &quot;Cheikh&quot; status in return for guarding the princes Fakhr-al-Din II and Younès al-Maani. The Khazen crest reflects the family&#x27;s special closeness to Mount Lebanon, with snowy mountains and a cedar tree depicted.

During the Lebanese Civil War of 1983-84, Mount Lebanon became the site of the Mountain War. The sub-conflict resulted in a victory for the LNRF, causing factors of the Lebanese Armed Forces to withdraw from the southern summit.

==Intercommunal relationships==
==Political term==

Mount Lebanon also lent its name to two political designations: a semi-autonomous province in Ottoman Syria that was established in 1861 and the central Governorate of modern Lebanon (see Mount Lebanon Governorate). The Mount Lebanon administrative region emerged in a time of rise of nationalism after the civil war of 1860. France intervened on behalf of the local Christian population and Britain on behalf of the Druze after the 1860 massacres in which 10,000 Christians were killed in clashes with the Druze. In 1861, the &quot;Mount Lebanon&quot; autonomous district was established within the Ottoman system, under an international guarantee. The Maronite Catholics and the Druze founded modern Lebanon in the early eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the &quot;Maronite-Druze dualism&quot; in Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate.

For decades, the Christians pressured the European powers to award them self determination by extending their small Lebanese territory to what they dubbed &quot;Greater Lebanon&quot;, referring to a geographic unit comprising Mount Lebanon and its coast, and the Beqaa Valley to its east. After the First World War, France took hold of the formerly Ottoman holdings in the northern Levant, and expanded the borders of Mount Lebanon in 1920 to form Greater Lebanon, which was to be populated by remnants of the Middle Eastern Christian community. The Christians ended up gaining territorially, but the new borders merely ended the demographic dominance of Christians in the newly created territory of Lebanon.

<doc id="381123" wikidata="Q336478" url="?curid=381123" title="Baan Corporation">
<text>Baan was a vendor of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software that is now owned by Infor Global Solutions. Baan or Baan ERP, was also the name of the ERP product created by this company.

== History ==
The Baan Corporation was created by Jan Baan in 1978 in Barneveld, Netherlands to provide financial and administrative consulting services. With the development of his first software package, Jan Baan and his brother Paul Baan entered what was to become the ERP industry. The Baan company focused on the creation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software.

Jan Baan developed his first computer program on a Durango F-85 computer in the programming language BASIC. In the early &#x27;80s, The Baan Corporation began to develop applications for Unix computers with C and a self-developed Baan-C language, the syntax of which was very similar to the BASIC language.

Baan rose in popularity during the early nineties. Baan software is famous for its Dynamic Enterprise Modeler (DEM), technical architecture, and its 4GL language. Baan 4GL and Tools is still considered to be one of the most efficient and productive database application development platforms. Baan became a real threat to market leader SAP after winning a large Boeing deal in 1994. It went IPO in 1995 and became a public listed company in Amsterdam and US Nasdaq. Several large consulting firms around the world partnered to implement Baan IV for multi-national companies. It acquired several other software companies to enrich its product portfolio, including Antalys, Aurum, Berclain, Coda and Caps Logistics. Sales growth rate was once claimed to reach 91% per year.

However the fall of the Baan Company began in 1998. The management exaggerated company revenue by booking &quot;sales&quot; of software licenses that were actually transferred to a related distributor. The discovery of this revenue manipulation led to a sharp decline of Baan&#x27;s stock price at the end of 1998.

In June 2000, facing worsening financial difficulties, lawsuits and reporting seven consecutive quarterly losses and bleak prospects, Baan was sold at a price of US$700 million to Invensys, a UK automation, controls, and process solutions group to become a unit of its Software and Services Division. Laurens van der Tang was the president of this unit. With the acquisition of Baan, Invensys&#x27;s CEO Allen Yurko began to offer &quot;Sensor to Boardroom&quot; solutions to customers.

In June 2003, after Allen Yurko stepped down, Invensys sold its Baan unit to SSA Global Technologies for US$ 135 million. Upon acquiring the Baan software, SSA renamed Baan as SSA ERP Ln. In August 2005, SSA Global released a new version of Baan, named SSA ERP LN 6.1.

In May 2006, SSA was acquired by Infor Global Solutions of Atlanta, a major ERP consolidator in the market.

== Baan Virtual Machine – bshell ==
Bshell is the core component of a Baan application server. It is a process on a virtual machine, to run the Baan 4GL language. Bshell was ported to different server platforms which made the Baan program scripts platform independent. For example, a Baan session developed on the Windows platform could be copied to a Linux platform without re-compiling the application code. Bshell is similar to nowaday&#x27;s Java VM or .Net CLR.

== Fraud ==
In 1998 Baan had a class action lawsuit filed against them for violation of the securities exchange act of 1934 held in the United States District Court of Columbia. Baan &quot;...undertook a scheme and course of conduct intended to inflate Baan&#x27;s results through various financial manipulations&quot;. The movie &quot;&quot; was based on the events with the Baan brothers in 1998. The end credits indicate that it is not a documentary but fiction and that the makers did not intend to portray individuals and events accurately; However, the similarity with the Baan debacle is obvious.

<text>Maras, subfamily Dolichotinae, are a group of rodents in the family Caviidae. These large relatives of guinea pigs are common in the Patagonian steppes of Argentina, but also live in Paraguay and elsewhere in South America. There are two extant species, the Patagonian mara of the genus &quot;Dolichotis&quot; and the Chacoan mara of the genus &quot;Pediolagus&quot;. Traditionally this species was also thought to belong to &quot;Dolichotis&quot;; however, a 2020 study by the American Society of Mammalogists found significant difference between the two mara species to warrant resurrecting the genus &quot;Pediolagus&quot; for it. Several extinct genera are also known.

== Description ==

Maras have stocky bodies, three sharp-clawed digits on the hind feet, and four digits of the fore feet. Maras have been described as resembling long-legged rabbits; while standing, they can also resemble a small ungulate. Patagonian maras can run at speeds up to . The Patagonian species can weigh over in adulthood. The average weight of adult male Patagonian maras is and in adult females is . Meanwhile, the Chacoan mara, though still large for a rodent, is much smaller, weighing around .

Most maras have brown heads and bodies, dark (almost black) rumps with a white fringe around the base, and white bellies.

Maras may amble, hop in a rabbit-like fashion, gallop, or bounce on all fours. They have been known to leap up to .

Maras mate for life, and may have from one to three offspring each year. Mara young are very well-developed, and can start grazing within 24 hours. They use a crèche system, where one pair of adults keeps watch all the young in the crèche. If they spot danger, the young rush below ground into a burrow, and the adults are left to run to escape.

== Genera ==
*&quot;Dolichotis&quot;
*&quot;Pediolagus&quot;
*†&quot;Eodolichotis&quot;
*†&quot;Pliodolichotis&quot;
*†&quot;Propediolagus&quot;
*†&quot;Rhodanodolichotis&quot;

== Interaction with humans ==
Patagonian maras are often kept in zoos or as pets, and are also known as &quot;Patagonian cavies&quot; or &quot;Patagonian hares&quot;. They can be quite social with humans if raised with human interaction from a young age, though they avoid people in the wild. Maras may even change their habits from coming out in day to becoming nocturnal, simply to avoid social interaction.

<text>Pitești () is a city in Romania, located on the river Argeș. The capital and largest city of Argeș County, it is an important commercial and industrial center, as well as the home of two universities. Pitești is situated in the historical region of Muntenia. It lies on the A1 freeway connecting the city directly to the national capital Bucharest, being an important railway junction, with a classification yard in nearby Bălilești. The city houses the Arpechim oil refinery, and is a marketing center for the automotive industry, in particular, Automobile Dacia.

Inhabited since prehistoric times but first mentioned in the 14th century, it developed as a trading town in northern Wallachia, serving as an informal residence for various Wallachian Princes until the 18th century. From the 19th century and until the interwar period, it was an important political center for the National Liberal Party and the main residence of the Brătianu family of politicians. During the early stages of the communist regime, it was one of the main sites of political repression, with the Pitești Prison becoming home to an experiment in brainwashing techniques.

==History==

===Early history===
The earliest traces of human settlements in this area relate to the Paleolithic. Coins minted by the Dacians during the 3rd century BC, copying the design of Thracian &quot;tetradrachmon&quot; issued by Lysimachus, have been discovered here. A small Roman &quot;castrum&quot; was built sometime in the 3rd century AD in the vicinity of present-day Pitești (part of a protection system for Roman Dacia and Moesia). During the Age of Migrations, the Pitești area was, according to historian Constantin C. Giurescu, the site of trading between Vlachs and Slavs, which, in his opinion, was the origin of &quot;Târgul din Deal&quot; (&quot;The Market on the Hill&quot;), a separate locality.

The first recorded mention of Pitești itself was on May 20, 1386, when Wallachian Prince Mircea I granted a gristmill in the area to Cozia Monastery. Pitești was subsequently one of the temporary residences of Wallachian Princes. Due to its positioning on the junction of major European routes (and its proximity to the Saxon markets in Hermannstadt, Transylvania), the city originally developed as an important commercial center. By the late 14th century, it became home to a sizable Armenian community.

At the time, the locality was only extending on the left bank of the Argeș, and gradually expanded over the river, reaching the hill slopes to the west (in the 19th century, it completely absorbed &quot;Târgul din Deal&quot;). While Pitești was commonly designated as a high-ranking town, a village of Pitești was still mentioned as late as 1528, which led some historians to conclude that the village and urban area coexisted within the same boundaries.

===Early Modern period===

Although princely quarters have not been uncovered, among the rulers to issue documents from Pitești were Basarab Țepeluș cel Tânăr (1477–1481), Neagoe Basarab (1512–1521), Vlad Înecatul (1530–1532), Vlad Vintilă de la Slatina (1532–1535), Michael the Brave (1593–1601), Simion Movilă (1601–1602), Matei Basarab (1632–1654) and Constantin Șerban (1654–1658). In addition, Constantin Brâncoveanu (1688–1714), who owned large sections of vineyard in the area, is reported to have spent several seasons in the town.

Under Vlad Vintilă, who allied himself with the Holy Roman Empire against his Ottoman overlords, Aloisio Gritti (governor of Ottoman Hungary) and his Wallachian boyar partisans camped in the Pitești neighborhood of Războieni, where they were attacked and defeated by the Prince. In 1600–1601, troops of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, led by Jan Zamoyski, were stationed in Pitești during their expedition against Michael the Brave (&quot;see Moldavian Magnate Wars&quot;). Around that time, fighting occurred in and around the town as the new prince Radu Șerban clashed with the Ottomans and their Crimean Khanate allies.

Constantin Șerban financed the building of the Orthodox Saint George Church, completed in 1656. His building program also included a (since-lost) palace and adjacent gardens. Around that time, the city hosted travelers of renown, such as Arab chronicler Paul of Aleppo and Swedish politician Claes Rålamb. It was during Brâncoveanu&#x27;s rule that the city was home to &quot;Stolnic&quot; Constantin Cantacuzino, who was exchanging letters with English statesman William, Baron Paget. A tower and other princely houses, built by Brâncoveanu outside the town, gradually deteriorated over the 18th and 19th centuries (the last standing structure was lost in the 20th century). In 1689, Habsburg troops led by Louis William of Baden occupied the city as part of the Great Turkish War (they were repelled later that year).

===18th and early 19th centuries===
In November 1714, as a direct result of Swedish defeats in the Great Northern War against Imperial Russia, Swedish King Charles XII unsuccessfully sought an alliance with Sultan Ahmed III; on his way back from Istanbul, Charles and Axel Sparre passed through Pitești, and, after a three-week stay, made their way to Swedish Pomerania through Habsburg-ruled regions. During the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718, Habsburg troops attacked and captured the town; Pitești was again the scene of battles during the Austro-Turkish War of 1737–1739.

In 1780, Tuscan numismatist Domenico Sestini passed through the Argeș region, and described the town as having 250 houses and 7 churches. In 1804, the citizens requested to have an upper school opened (to offer lectures in Greek, the educational language of the time); their request was denied by Prince Constantine Ypsilantis. During the 1790s, Pitești was visited by Luigi Mayer, a German pupil of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, who left etchings of the region (including the very first one of Pitești); they were published in London in 1810, with text by a T. Bowyer, whose caption for Pitești read &quot;nothing more wild or romantic can be conceived&quot;.

The town was an important location for events relating to the last stage of the Wallachian uprising of 1821 and the first stages of the Greek War of Independence: it was here that, in late spring 1821, the Wallachian rebel leader Tudor Vladimirescu settled after retreating from Bucharest. His departure raised suspicion from his Eterist allies that he was planning to abandon the common cause. Vladimirescu was captured in the nearby locality of Băilești and executed soon after, on orders from Alexander Ypsilantis.

===Late 19th and early 20th century===

The city was developed further after the 1859 unification of the Danubian Principalities and the 1881 creation of the Romanian Kingdom. Around that time, and down to the late interwar, the city became a National Liberal center, largely due to the Brătianu family of politicians residing in nearby Ștefănești. Their manor, &quot;Florica&quot;, housed most major reunions of the National Liberal leaders. For a short period in 1882, Pitești was home to dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale, leading some to propose that it was the unnamed National Liberal-dominated city depicted in Caragiale&#x27;s famous play &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot;.

By 1872, a national railway connection with the capital Bucharest and Târgoviște was built, at the same time as one linking Bucharest with Ploiești through Chitila. Overseen by the German financier Bethel Henry Strousberg, this was the second project of its kind in Romania (after the Bucharest-Giurgiu rail link of 1869). The Pitești Town Hall was completed in 1886, and currently houses an art gallery. The Argeș County Prefecture, designed by Dimitrie Maimarolu, was erected in 1898–1899 on the site previously occupied by an Orthodox hermitage; it is the present-day site of the County Museum of History and Natural Sciences. Both buildings are eclectic in style, and feature frescoes painted by Iosif Materna.

Pitești experienced urbanization and economic development with several changes in landscape and a number of regional firsts. In 1868–1869, Pitești was the first city in Romania to have a recorded Seventh-day Adventist community, formed around Michał Belina-Czechowski, a Polish preacher and former Catholic priest who had returned from the United States (the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Romania was established only after 1918). By 1906, Pitești was home to a thriving cooperative bank, &quot;Banca Populară Pitești&quot;, which was also the first-ever financial institution in the Argeș County. In 1907, factory manager Edmond Landauer performed the very first Tayloristic experiments in Romania, at Pitești Weaving Mill.

From late autumn 1916 to 1918, during the World War I battles, Pitești was occupied by the troops of the Central Powers. The city was originally abandoned by the Romanian Army and taken by the German commander August von Mackensen as the front stabilized on the Olt River, before Mackensen was able to occupy Bucharest and the entire southern Romania. During the post-war existence of Greater Romania, Pitești became a regional cultural center, notably hosting the 1928–1929 series of the magazine &quot;Kalende&quot; (published in cooperation by literary critics Vladimir Streinu, Șerban Cioculescu, Pompiliu Constantinescu, and Tudor Șoimaru).

===World War II and communism===
Pitești was affected in various ways by World War II and its successive regimes. After a fascist National Legionary State was proclaimed by the Iron Guard in late 1940, a bronze bust of former premier Armand Călinescu (whom the Guard had assassinated in September 1939), was chained and dragged through the city streets. In December 1943, under the dictatorship of &quot;Conducător&quot; Ion Antonescu (a Pitești native), it saw the final chapter in a chain of deportations of Romani people to Transnistria (&quot;see Holocaust in Romania&quot;). The city was sporadically bombed by the Allies: on July 4, 1944, it was struck by a section of the US Fifteenth Air Force (&quot;see Bombing of Romania in World War II&quot;).

In the 1950s, while serving as capital of Regiunea Argeș, Pitești gained an ill notoriety, when the communist authorities used the local detention facility to subject political detainees to &quot;reeducation&quot;, in which violence between inmates was encouraged to the point of being mandatory (&quot;see Pitești prison&quot;). The experiment was carried out by the Securitate secret police and overseen by Alexandru Nicolschi; its goal was to psychologically destroy the capacity for outside attachment and outside loyalty, creating the brainwashed &quot;New Man&quot; prototype of Leninism. The program was canceled after some five years. At a trial held in 1953–1954, twenty-two inmate-participants were sentenced, with sixteen being condemned to death for their role in the experiment. In 1957, a new trial convicted certain members of the prison staff, who received light sentences; they were later pardoned.

In parallel, Pitești underwent numerous changes in landscape, including the completion of the A1 freeway, the first road of its kind, during the 1960s, and the acceleration of industrialization with a focus on the chemical and automotive industries. Around 1950, Pitești area accommodated ELAS refugees from the Greek Civil War (some of the buildings erected for this purpose were later used to house resettled peasants). &quot;Florica&quot; was nationalized in 1948, and was later partly devastated by Romanian Communist Party activists (for a while during the 1970s, it was a residence of the communist politician Ion Dincă). The bust of Ion Brătianu, standing in front of Saint Nicholas Church, was removed and melted, and the church itself was demolished in 1962.

==Geography==
The city is part of the historical region of Wallachia, situated in its north and in the westernmost part of its Muntenian subregion. It lies on the right bank of the Argeș, where the river meets its tributary, Râul Doamnei.
Pitești is situated above sea level, on terraces formed by the Argeș, and belongs to the southernmost section of the Getic Plateau (an area of foothills leading up to the Southern Carpathians). The Plateau is at its narrowest in the Pitești area, where it only reaches in width, as opposed to the average. The city has access to a piedmont plain, known as &quot;Câmpia Piteștilor&quot; (&quot;Pitești Plain&quot;) and characterized by water-meadows. To the west, it abuts the Trivale Forest, which has been partly set up as a leisure park.

Pitești is adjacent to two reservoirs on the Argeș, in its Prundu area and in nearby Bascov (the Budeasa Dam). It is situated downstream from Lake Vidraru and upstream from the reservoir in Bălilești.

===Climate===

According to the Köppen climate classification, the city lies within the humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) category. Average annual temperatures range between 9 °C and 10 °C. The average January temperature is -2.4 °C, while the average July temperature is 20.8 °C.

==Demographics==

As of 2021 census data, 141,275 inhabitants live within the city limits, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2011 census.

Romania&#x27;s 2011 census recorded a population of 155,383 for the city. Of the individuals for whom data were available, 99.1% were ethnic Romanians and 0.6% Roma. In terms of religion, 98.4% were Romanian Orthodox; 0.3% Roman Catholic; and 0.2% each Pentecostal, Christian Evangelical, Baptist and Evangelical. A further 0.2% were atheist or non-religious. A 2016 estimate placed the population at 177,485. The 1930 census found that 88.0% of residents were Romanians, 3.0% Jews, 2.5% Hungarians, 2.2% Roma, 1.4% Germans, 0.6% Greeks and 0.3% each Russians, Bulgarians, Armenians and, grouped together, Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

The population of Pitești grew between the 1830s and the 1990s, with the most sustained period of growth occurring after the 1950s, when industrial development created jobs and attracted residents from nearby settlements. The population peaked at an estimated 187,000 in 1997, then stagnated until 2001, and has gradually decreased since that time. The drop is particularly noticeable among the male population: this segment not only has a higher mortality and lower life expectancy, but also, due to de-industrialization, emigrated in search of work in significant numbers.

==Economy==

Pitești is one of the most industrialized cities in Romania. It is the center of the automotive industry in the country: the Automobile Dacia automaker is situated in the nearby town of Mioveni, and several other automobile parts manufacturers are located within its urban area (Dräxlmaier Group, Lear Corporation and Valeo). The city also houses the Arpechim oil refinery, part of the Petrom group. The plant, established as a state-owned company during communism, has traditionally been the center of controversy over its air pollution records. In 2007, the Ministry of the Environment withdrew Arpechim&#x27;s permit, but Petrom contested the decision in court. The plant is scheduled to gradually reduce its activity over a period of several years, pending eventual closure.

The city is surrounded by hills rich in wineries and plum orchards. The latter give one of the finest Romanian &quot;țuicas&quot;: &quot;țuica de Pitești&quot;. The Ștefănești winery, situated on the opposite bank of the Argeș River, is one of the best known in Romania.

==Culture==
=== Theatre ===

Pitești is home to a County Theater; established in 1948, it was named in honor of playwright Alexandru Davila a decade later. Its branches include a puppet theater (created in 1949), the &quot;Estrada&quot; section for open-air performances (1958), and a folklore section (1970). The Theater&#x27;s Studio 125 was established in May 1975 by director Liviu Ciulei.

The first written record of a theatrical performance in the city dates to 1848, when Constantin Halepliu set up a troupe. Following that year&#x27;s revolution, several actors, Halepliu included, were arrested, and the theatre closed until 1856. A Communal Theatre was built in 1914–1916. Since 1948, the local acting ensemble has performed both in other Romanian cities and abroad, including in Poland, Serbia, Bulgaria, Italy and Spain.

=== Education ===
The city houses two universities: the state-run University of Pitești and the private Constantin Brâncoveanu University (founded 1991, with branches in Brăila and Râmnicu Vâlcea). There are 17 secondary education institutions, including two main high schools—the Ion Brătianu National College (founded 1866) and the Zinca Golescu National College. There are also 20 primary schools, 23 kindergartens and 10 nursery schools.

A public library, named after intellectual figure Dinicu Golescu, was planned in 1869 by Paraschiva Stephu, a female member of the upper class, who drew up a will leaving 200 Austrian ducats for the purpose of creating a library. The institution became operational in 1880, and a large part of the volumes were bequeathed by historian George Ionescu-Gion immediately following his death in 1904. His donation included over a thousand books in Romanian, French and Italian. The library moved into its current headquarters in the city center in 2003.

=== Festivals ===

Each year during springtime, Pitești is host to a festival and fair known as &quot;Simfonia lalelelor&quot; (the &quot;Tulip Symphony&quot;). Tulips were introduced locally in 1972–1973, when around 3,000 bulbs brought from Arad and Oradea were planted in its central area, along with other flowers. Pitești consequently acquired a reputation as a tulip-growing area, and the flower-themed festival was first organized by the local authorities in 1978. Typically held in the cultural centre building (&quot;Casa Cărții&quot;), the festival also includes folk music performances, international scientific conferences, an art exhibit and youth sport competitions.

==Sport==
The major football club in the city is FC Argeș Pitești, which has generally played in Liga I, and has the Nicolae Dobrin Stadium as its home ground. In addition, the city was home to a Liga II football club, Internațional Pitești (located on Stadionul Ștrand), and has a school which doubles as a junior team, Sporting Pitești. Pitești hosts basketball team BCM U Pitești, as well as a women&#x27;s volleyball team, Argeș Volei Pitești.

Pitești is home to an Olympic size swimming pool, the home ground for CSM Pitești, and a public outdoor swimming pool in the Tudor Vladimirescu area. Nearby Bascov also has a public swimming place, on grounds adjacent to the Budeasa Dam. The national canoe racing also trains at the Budeasa Dam sports base, and the location is also used for recreational fishing. A tennis challenger tournament (&quot;Turneul challenger feminin Pitești&quot;) takes place each year, on grounds in Bascov.

<doc id="381161" wikidata="Q653885" url="?curid=381161" title="Lyric Opera of Chicago">
<text>Lyric Opera of Chicago is an American opera company based in Chicago, Illinois. The company was founded in Chicago in 1954, under the name &#x27;Lyric Theatre of Chicago&#x27; by Carol Fox, Nicola Rescigno and Lawrence Kelly, with a season that included Maria Callas&#x27;s American debut in &quot;Norma&quot;. Fox re-organized the company in 1956 under its present name. Lyric is housed in a theater and related spaces in the Civic Opera Building. These spaces are now owned by Lyric.

==Opera in Chicago, 1850–1954==
The first opera to be performed in Chicago was Bellini&#x27;s &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, presented by a traveling opera company on 29 July 1850. Chicago&#x27;s first opera house opened in 1865 but was destroyed in the Great Fire of Chicago in 1871. The second opera house, the Chicago Auditorium, opened in 1889.

In 1929, the current Civic Opera House on 20 North Wacker Drive was opened, though the Chicago Civic Opera Company itself collapsed in the Great Depression. The old Auditorium continued to produce stage shows and musicals until it closed in 1941.

Resident opera companies began in Chicago in 1910 with the Chicago Grand Opera Company being formed from the remains of the Manhattan Opera Company, which had been founded by Oscar Hammerstein I, and had been squeezed out by the more financially sound Metropolitan Opera. Chicago had this first company for four seasons, then, after no season in 1914/15, it was re-formed as the Chicago Opera Association. This lasted through 1921/22, when it became the Chicago Civic Opera from 1922 until 1932. After no season in 1932/33, the company was re-formed and again named the Chicago Grand Opera Company from 1933 to 1935. From 1936 to 1939, the company was called Chicago City Opera Company, and finally from 1940 to 1946 opera was presented by the Chicago Opera Company. There were no seasons from 1947 until 1953, so opera was presented by other companies on tour. Lyric Opera of Chicago was formed in 1954 and has continued uninterrupted except for 1967.

==Lyric Opera, 1954 to 1980==
Carol Fox, America&#x27;s first female opera impresario at the age of 28, began her first season in 1954 by bringing Maria Callas for her American debut in the title role of &quot;Norma&quot;, the first of many electrifying Callas performances in Chicago. However, this first eight-opera season in 1954 was not the result of a long apprenticeship in opera production; Carol Fox, fluent in Italian and French, had studied opera singing for many years, culminating in two years of intensive work in Italy. However, when she realized that performance was not to be in her future, she decided that it lay in bringing the performances of the world&#x27;s finest artists to her home town of Chicago. Her success can be measured in one statistic regarding the filling of Lyric&#x27;s Civic Opera House: in 1954, the season ran for three weeks; in 2007/08 Lyric had an almost six-month season.

Fox also used her formidable persuasive powers on artists other than singers: she was able to bring Rudolf Nureyev to make his debut on an American opera stage at Lyric; Vera Zorina, Alicia Markova, Erik Bruhn and Maria Tallchief also danced at Lyric, and George Balanchine created choreography for Lyric. The Italian composer Pino Donati was her artistic director. Bruno Bartoletti was principal conductor, but other conductors included Tullio Serafin, Dimitri Mitropoulos and Artur Rodziński. Christoph von Dohnányi and Sir Georg Solti chose Lyric for their American operatic debuts. Franco Zeffirelli staged operas as did Harold Prince. After retiring from dancing, Tallchief moved to Chicago where she served as director of ballet for Lyric from 1973 to 1979. In 1974, she founded Lyric Opera&#x27;s ballet school, where she taught the Balanchine technique. 

Because of Fox&#x27;s illnesses and her refusal to lower her artistic standards despite Lyric&#x27;s dire financial state in 1980, her resignation was sought and given. She died a few months later, survived by a daughter, Victoria.

It was of Lyric&#x27;s founder that Saul Bellow wrote in 1979 &quot;Miss Fox will be remembered, together with Jane Addams of Hull House and Harriet Monroe of Poetry magazine, as one of Chicago&#x27;s greatest women.&quot;

Throughout the many years at Lyric, Carol Fox developed the confidence and authority to bring world-famous artists to Lyric: Luciano Pavarotti (56 performances in 7 roles), Tito Gobbi, Eleanor Steber, Jussi Björling, Birgit Nilsson, Renata Tebaldi, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Giulietta Simionato, Richard Tucker, Boris Christoff, Eileen Farrell, Dorothy Kirsten, Leonie Rysanek, Leontyne Price, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Geraint Evans, Mirella Freni, Nicolai Ghiaurov, Alfredo Kraus, Renata Scotto, Robert Merrill, Joan Sutherland, Christa Ludwig, Jon Vickers, Marilyn Horne, Grace Bumbry, Montserrat Caballé, Tatiana Troyanos, Sherrill Milnes, Plácido Domingo, Felicia Weathers, Vyacheslav Polozov and José Carreras. Anna Moffo also chose Lyric for her American debut.

==Later administrations==
Fox was succeeded at Lyric by her longtime assistant manager, Ardis Krainik (1981–1996), after whom the opera house was later named, and then by William Mason (1997–2011). 

From 1964 to 1974, Bruno Bartoletti, served as co-artistic director and principal conductor, and became sole director and principal from 1974 to 2000. Sir Andrew Davis was Lyric&#x27;s music director and principal conductor, a post he occupied beginning in September 2000. Davis retired in June 2021 and passed the baton to Enrique Mazzola, Lyric Opera&#x27;s current music director and principal conductor.

Danny Newman was the company&#x27;s long-time press agent from 1954 until his retirement in the 2001-2002 season. Newman is largely credited as the founder of subscription-based arts marketing, the standard economic model for not-for-profit arts organizations in the US. Philip David Morehead was head of music staff until his retirement in 2015.

Anthony Freud became general director of the company in October 2011. In September 2020, Lyric announced the election of Sylvia Neil as chair of Lyric’s board of directors, the first woman board chair in Lyric’s history. In December 2021, Freud&#x27;s contract was extended through 2026. However, Freud concluded his tenure with the company at the close of the 2023-2024 season, two seasons earlier than the previously announced extension of his most recent contract. In July 2024, the company announced the appointment of John Mangum as its next general director, effective with the autumn of 2024.

==Production history==
In addition to the standard operatic repertoire, Lyric also presents contemporary works. Recent productions have included Harbison&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (2000–2001), Weill&#x27;s &quot;Street Scene&quot; (2001–2002), Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Susannah&quot;, Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; (2002–2003), and John Adams&#x27; &quot;Doctor Atomic&quot; directed by Peter Sellars.

Composer William Bolcom wrote his most recent opera for Lyric, &quot;A Wedding&quot;, based on the 1978 film of the same name directed by Robert Altman. It premiered during Lyric&#x27;s 50th-anniversary season. During the 2015/16 season, the company premiered its latest commission, &quot;Bel Canto&quot; by Peruvian composer Jimmy López with a libretto by Nilo Cruz based on the novel by Ann Patchett.

Lyric&#x27;s productions were broadcast and nationally syndicated by WFMT Radio Network, from 1971 until 2001. The broadcasts ceased then because of a loss of sponsorship. The issue was resolved at the 11th hour for the October 21, 2006 premiere of Richard Strauss&#x27;s opera &quot;Salome&quot; starring Deborah Voigt. Syndicated broadcast of Lyric resumed in May 2007 on the WFMT network, which was included on XM Satellite Radio before it merged and became SiriusXM Radio.

==Civic Opera House==
The company&#x27;s permanent home is the Civic Opera House, sections of the building which it rented from 1954 until after the 1993 renovations, when it bought those facilities. It is a 1929 structure with an Art Deco interior. Its 3,563-seat capacity makes it the second-largest opera auditorium in North America after the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. The interior was named &quot;The Ardis Krainik Theatre&quot; in 1996 in honor of Ardis Krainik, the former General Director, who was responsible for its renovation from 1993 onwards.

===Joffrey Ballet===

In 2017, Lyric Opera of Chicago as house manager of the theater announced that the Joffrey Ballet planned to move from its longtime performance venue at the Auditorium Theatre to the opera house in 2020. The announcement coincided with Lyric&#x27;s presentation of a new production of Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; by choreographer John Neumeier; the production fused the musical and ballet elements of the opera and featured the Joffrey Ballet.

==Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center==
The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center (formerly , 1981–2006), established in 1974 as the Lyric Opera School by Carol Fox, is the professional artist-development program for Lyric Opera of Chicago.

The Ryan Opera Center is considered one of the most prestigious vocal programs in America,
and has produced notable singers, including:

*Harolyn Blackwell
*Nicole Cabell
*Mark S. Doss
*Elizabeth Futral
*Cecelia Hall
*Joseph Kaiser
*Quinn Kelsey
*Gary Lehman
*Emily Magee
*Susanna Phillips
*Matthew Polenzani
*Christian Van Horn
*Erin Wall
*Guang Yang
*Kathleen Kuhlmann
Approximately a dozen young singers are selected from the near 400 who audition annually, and they are in residence for twelve months. Over the course of the year they receive advanced instruction in numerous aspects of operatic performance, including voice lessons and coachings, language and acting training, and master classes with some of opera&#x27;s most renowned artists. The singers gain valuable performing experience by participating in recitals and concerts at many Chicago-area venues. During Lyric&#x27;s mainstage season, they perform and understudy roles at all levels. The singers work with the world&#x27;s greatest opera singers, conductors, and directors, thus advancing the young artists’ professionalism. In 2005, author William Murray wrote a book about a year in the life of an entering class at the Ryan Opera Center.

The first director of the Ryan Opera Center during its beginning years from 1974-1981, when it was renamed the Lyric Opera Center Center, and continuing until 1991, when he retired, was Lee Schaenen. Andrew Földi succeeded him as director of the Ryan Opera Center from 1991 to 1995. He was succeeded by Richard Pearlman, who was director of the program from 1995 until his death in 2006. Renowned soprano Gianna Rolandi, who had been the Ryan Opera Center&#x27;s director of vocal studies and principal instructor since 2002, was appointed director of the program in 2006. The program is now administered by Dan Novak, director; Craig Terry, music director; Julia Faulkner, director of vocal studies, and Renée Fleming, advisor.

<text>The Serbian Armed Forces () is the military of Serbia.

The President of the Republic acts as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, while administration and defence policy is carried out by the Government through the Ministry of Defence. The highest operational authority, in-charge of the deployment and preparation of the armed forces in peace and war, is the General Staff.

Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime. Serbia is ranked 63 out of 145 countries considered for the annual GFP review.

The Serbian Armed Forces consists of two branches: Serbian Army and Serbian Air Force and Air Defence.

==History==


Serbia has a long military tradition dating to early medieval period. The modern Serbian military dates back to the Serbian Revolution which started in 1804 with the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman occupation of Serbia. The victories in the battles of Ivankovac (1805), Mišar (August 1806), Deligrad (December 1806) and Belgrade (November–December 1806), led to the establishment of the Principality of Serbia in 1817. The subsequent Second Serbian Uprising of 1815–1817 led to full independence and recognition of the Kingdom of Serbia and weakened the Ottoman dominance in the Balkans. In November 1885 the Serbo-Bulgarian War occurred following Bulgarian unification and resulted in a Bulgarian victory. In 1912 the First Balkan War (1912–1913) erupted between the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan League (Serbia, Greece, Montenegro and Bulgaria). Balkan League victories in the Battle of Kumanovo (October 1912), the Battle of Prilep (November 1912), the Battle of Monastir (November 1912), the Battle of Adrianople (November 1912 to March 1913), and the Siege of Scutari (October 1912 to April 1913) resulted in the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which lost most of its remaining Balkan territories per the Treaty of London (May 1913). Shortly after, the Second Balkan War (June to August, 1913) broke out when Bulgaria, dissatisfied with the division of territory, declared war against its former allies, Serbia and Greece. Following a string of defeats, Bulgaria requested an armistice and signed the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest, formally ending the war.

Serbia&#x27;s independence and growing influence threatened neighboring Austria-Hungary which led to the Bosnian crisis of 1908–09. Consequently, from 1901, all Serbian males between the ages of 21 and 46 became liable for general mobilization. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in June 1914, Austria-Hungary implicated Serbians and declared war on Serbia (July 1914), which marked the beginning of the First World War of 1914–1918. Serbian forces repelled three consecutive invasions by Austria in 1914, securing the first major victories of the war for the Allies, but were eventually overwhelmed by the combined forces of the Central Powers (October–November 1915) and forced to retreat through Albania (1915–1916) to the Greek island of Corfu (1915–1916).

Serbian military activity after World War I took place in the context of various Yugoslav armies until the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the restoration of Serbia as an independent state in 2006.

==Organization==
The Serbian Armed Forces are commanded by the General Staff corp of senior officers. The general staff is led by the Chief of the General Staff.

==Traditions==
===Motto===
Motto of the Serbian Armed Forces is &quot;For Freedom and Honour of the Fatherland&quot; (&quot;Za slobodu i čast Otadžbine&quot;) and is found on uniforms as well as on brigade flags.

===Armed Forces Day===
Serbian Armed Forces Day (&quot;Dan Vojske Srbije&quot;) is marked on 23 April, the anniversary of the Second Serbian Uprising. On that day in 1815, in Takovo, prominent elders met and decided to start the fight for liberation of Serbia from the Turkish authorities, which eventually led to the free and independent Serbia.

===Patron Saint===

The patron saint (&quot;krsna slava&quot;) of the Serbian Armed Forces is Saint Stefan Visoki. The first celebration was held in 2023; earlier that year, the Holy Council of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church decided that the patron saint of the Serbian Armed Forces should be Saint Stefan Visoki, 15th-century Serbian ruler and saint, remembered as a wise statesman and a successful military leader.

===Marches===

The Serbian military was the first to pioneer the high-step as a military step. It is similar to the goose step, with the difference being that the knee is bent at the top of the arc. It was used by the Royal Yugoslav Army and at the time was called the &quot;male step&quot;. The Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army abandoned it after World War II, being in use for over two decades before being replaced by high-stepping in the 1975 Victory Day Parade, to assert itself as independent from Soviet influence. High-stepping is still used today by Serbian Armed Forces, and is also utilized by the militaries of North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

===March Music===
There are several marches in use in Serbian Armed Forces. The standard one is Parade March (&quot;Paradni marš&quot;), while the Guard uses its own Guard March (&quot;Gardijski marš&quot;) as standard march music. Also frequently used and the most popular and recognizable by the general public in Serbia is famous March on the Drina (&quot;Marš na Drinu&quot;). Other frequently used march is Vojvoda Stepa Stepanović March (&quot;Marš vojvode Stepe Stepanovića&quot;).

==Deployments==
The Serbian Armed Forces actively take part in numerous multinational peacekeeping missions.

<text>William Elden Bolcom (born May 26, 1938) is an American composer and pianist. He has received the Pulitzer Prize, the National Medal of Arts, a Grammy Award, the Detroit Music Award and was named 2007 Composer of the Year by Musical America. He taught composition at the University of Michigan from 1973 until 2008. He is married to mezzo-soprano Joan Morris.

==Early life and education==
Bolcom was born in Seattle, Washington. At age 11, he entered the University of Washington to study composition privately with George Frederick McKay and John Verrall and piano with Madame Berthe Poncy Jacobson. &quot;He later studied with Darius Milhaud at Mills College while working on his Master of Arts degree, with Leland Smith at Stanford University while working on his D.M.A., and with Olivier Messiaen at the Paris Conservatoire, where he received the 2ème Prix de Composition&quot;.

==Career==
Bolcom was awarded Guggenheim Fellowships in 1964 and 1968 for Music Composition. He won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1988 for &quot;12 New Etudes for Piano&quot;. In the fall of 1994, he was named the Ross Lee Finney Distinguished University Professor of Composition at the University of Michigan. In 2006, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts. Notable students include Gabriela Lena Frank, Carter Pann, Elena Ruehr, Derek Bermel, Joel Puckett, and David T. Little.

As a pianist, Bolcom has performed and recorded frequently in collaboration with Joan Morris, whom he married in 1975. They have recorded more than two dozen albums together, beginning with the Grammy-nominated &quot;After the Ball,&quot; a collection of popular songs from around the turn of the 20th century. Their primary specialties in both concerts and recordings are show tunes, parlor, and popular songs from the late 19th and early 20th century by Henry Russell, Henry Clay Work and others, and cabaret songs.

As a soloist, Bolcom has recorded his own compositions, as well as music by George Gershwin, Darius Milhaud and several of the classic ragtime composers. His compositions have been recognized and highlighted at Michigan State University in their Michigan Writers Series.

==Works==

Bolcom&#x27;s earliest compositions were written when he was around eleven years old; his early influences include Roy Harris and Béla Bartók. His compositions from around 1960 employed a modified serial technique, under the influence of Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Luciano Berio, whose music he particularly admired. In the 1960s he gradually began to embrace an eclectic use of a wider variety of musical styles. His goal has been to erase boundaries between popular music and art music.

Together with Joan Morris, Bolcom composed the satirical song &quot;Lime Jello Marshmallow Cottage Cheese Surprise&quot; (1980).

He has composed four major operas. Three of them, &quot;McTeague&quot;, &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;, and &quot;A Wedding&quot; were commissioned and premiered by the Lyric Opera of Chicago and conducted by Dennis Russell Davies. All of these were composed with librettist Arnold Weinstein, sometimes in collaboration with other writers. &quot;McTeague&quot;, based on the 1899 novel by Frank Norris, with libretto by Weinstein, was premiered on October 31, 1992. &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;, with libretto by Weinstein and Arthur Miller, was premiered October 9, 1999. &quot;A Wedding&quot;, based on the 1978 motion picture by Robert Altman and John Considine, with libretto by Weinstein and Altman, was premiered on December 11, 2004. His fourth opera, &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot;, composed with librettist Mark Campbell, based on the George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber play of the same name, was premiered March 11, 2017, by the commissioning organization, Minnesota Opera.

He has also composed concertos such as &quot;Lyric Concerto&quot; for Flute and Orchestra for James Galway, the Concerto in D for Violin and Orchestra for Sergiu Luca, the Concerto for Clarinet and Orchestra for Stanley Drucker, and Concert Suite for alto saxophone and band, composed for University of Michigan professor Donald Sinta in 1998. He composed his concerto &quot;Gaea&quot; for two pianos (left hand) and orchestra for Gary Graffman and Leon Fleisher, both of whom have suffered from debilitating problems with their right hands. It received its first performance on April 11, 1996 by the Baltimore Symphony conducted by David Zinman. The concerto is constructed so that it can be performed in one of three ways, with either piano part alone with reduced orchestra, or with both piano parts and the two reduced orchestras combined into a full orchestra.

Bolcom&#x27;s other works include nine symphonies, twelve string quartets, four violin sonatas, a number of piano rags (one written in collaboration with William Albright), four volumes of &quot;Gospel Preludes&quot; for organ, four volumes of cabaret songs, three musical theater works (&quot;Casino Paradise&quot;, &quot;Dynamite Tonite&quot;, and &quot;Greatshot&quot;; all with Weinstein), and a one-act chamber opera, &quot;Lucrezia&quot;, with librettist Mark Campbell. William Bolcom was also commissioned to write &quot;Recuerdos&quot; for two pianos by The Dranoff International Two Piano Foundation.

=== Song cycles ===
Bolcom has written a number of song cycles. A very large portion of these song cycles were cabarets with lyrics by librettist/lyricist Arnold Weinstein and meant to be sung by mezzo-soprano Joan Morris, William Bolcom&#x27;s wife. These 24 cabarets were released in four volumes from the 1970s to the 1990s and were released all together on CD. &quot;From the Diary of Sally Hemings&quot;, a song cycle for voice and piano, is a collaboration with playwright/librettist Sandra Seaton. Among Bolcom&#x27;s other song cycles, the most well-known is his setting of William Blake&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience.&quot; The recording of this massive work was estimated at $375,000 USD and its length stands at about two and a half hours..

===&quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot;===

Bolcom&#x27;s setting of William Blake&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot;, a three-hour work for soloists, choruses, and orchestra, was a culmination of 25 years of work on the piece.

:Inspiration 
::At the age of seventeen, William Bolcom wanted to set the complete poems of &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot; by William Blake to music. As he comprehended the huge diversity of the artistic ideas and the technical styles presented in the poems, he realized that he needed more musical vocabulary of different styles in order to complete his music. This realization also bolstered his ideas that genres of music should not be placed in a hierarchy and that there was no distinction between &quot;serious&quot; music and &quot;popular&quot; music.

:Style and instrumentation
::Bolcom incorporated a variety of different musical styles and genres in the music, including modern classical style using pentatonic scales, tonal classical style, bluegrass, country, soul, folk vaudeville, rock musical, and reggae. Bolcom has used instruments that are not usually used in a traditional orchestra but are used in the genres that he chose: saxophones, guitar, electric guitar, bass guitar, harmonica, electric violin, and &quot;country, rock, and folk singers&quot;.

:Premiere and performances
::According to Naxos Records, the premiere of the &quot;Songs&quot; at the Stuttgart Opera in 1984 was followed by performances in Ann Arbor, Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, St. Louis, Carnegie Hall, and London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall, the latter performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Leonard Slatkin.

:Awards and reception
::In 2004, Naxos Records produced a recording of the &quot;Songs&quot; on location at Hill Auditorium, featuring the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance Symphony Orchestra, the student choirs from the same university, University Musical Society Choral Union, Michigan State University Children&#x27;s Choir, and a variety of solo instrumentalists and singers (who also included Joan Morris, wife of Bolcom). In 2006, it won four Grammy Awards for Best Choral Performance, Best Classical Contemporary Composition, Best Classical Album, and Best Producer of the Year, Classical.

::Composer and critic Robert Carl has stated that Bolcom wrote seemingly disparate genres of music with &quot;sincerity,&quot; without irony, &quot;as equal partners,&quot; and with &quot;love for and mastery of popular music&quot;.

==Festivals==
VocalEssence celebrated the music of William Bolcom with a two-week festival in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota in April 2007. Nine different performances and a number of master classes were part of the festival. The spotlight performance was of Bolcom&#x27;s setting of William Blake&#x27;s Songs &quot;of Innocence and of Experience&quot;, performed in Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis with over 400 musicians performing under projections of Blake&#x27;s accompanying artwork by Wendell K. Harrington.

Eastern Michigan University Celebrated its 16th Biennial Contemporary Music Festival by featuring William Bolcom as a guest composer. The three-day festival showcased a range of Bolcom&#x27;s compositions as well as a discussion on &quot;Musical Grass-Roots&quot; led by Bolcom himself.

Le Piano Ouvert celebrated Bolcom&#x27;s 75th birthday with a week of concerts and masterclasses in Paris in March 2014. William Bolcom and Joan Morris both performed, and were featured on France Musique in a series of live performances and interviews. The festival was directed by Guy Livingston, Anne de Fornel, and David Levi. Concerts were held at the Mona Bismarck American Center in Paris, and at the Hôtel Talleyrand on Place de la Concorde.

In April 2022, as part of the international Heidelberger Frühling Music Festival, William Bolcom&#x27;s second piano concerto was premiered by Igor Levit and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra conducted by Elim Chan in the auditorium of the Neue Universität Heidelberg.

<text>Tulcea (; also known by alternative names) is a city in Northern Dobruja, Romania. It is the administrative center of Tulcea County, and had a population of 65,624 . One village, Tudor Vladimirescu, is administered by the city. It is one of six Romanian county seats lying on the Danube river.

== Names ==
The city is known in Bulgarian, Russian and Ukrainian as Тулча, romanized: &quot;Tulcha&quot;; in Greek as Αιγισσός, romanized: &quot;Aigissós&quot;; in Hungarian as &quot;Tulcsa&quot;; and in Turkish as &quot;Tulça&quot;.
== History ==
===Iron Age===
Tulcea was founded in the 7th century BC under the name of &quot;Aegyssus&quot;, mentioned by Procopius. Ovid recorded a local tradition that ascribed its name to a mythical founder, Aegisos the Caspian.

===Roman period===
Aegyssus was built on a high hill, a strategic location for guarding the Danube particularly under the Romans.
The amphorae discovered from 1st century BC to 1st century AD suggest the town was an important trading centre of the period.

After the Getic raids from 1215 AD the Romans conquered the town and soon after built a new city. 

After Trajan&#x27;s Dacian Wars at the beginning of the 2nd century AD, the city was included in the Moesian Limes defensive frontier system as a military fort and port for a detachment of the &quot;Classis Flavia Moesica&quot;.

The baths were built at the end of the 1st century AD and used until the beginning of the 5th century after several reconstruction phases, in the third of which a large &quot;palaestra&quot; was added on the north side.

In the second half of the 3rd century AD, the &quot;cohors II Flavia Brittonum&quot; (from Britain) was garrisoned here, and in the next century the &quot;vexillatio Aegyssensis&quot; of &quot;Legio I Iovia&quot;. During the 4th-5th centuries, the city still preserved its military statute (headquarters of &quot;cuneus equitum armigerorum, praefectus ripae legionis primae ariae cohortium quinque pedaturae inferioris&quot;). It was destroyed during the Hun&#x27;s invasions in the 5th century and rebuilt under Justinian I along with the monumental reconstruction of the Danubian limes.

===Middle Ages===

The town was abandoned by the first half of the 7th century after the Avars-Slavs&#x27; attacks and the downfall of Danubian limes. The town is mentioned in Notitia Episcopatuum and De Thematibus on the list of the bishoprics of Dobrudja.

Inhabitation was restored in the second half of the 10th century, as the Byzantines built a fort on the spot after reconquering the region. The fort was soon destroyed in 1064 by an attack of the Uzes, however some inhabitation continued. A settlement, larger than the one in the 11th century, is archaeologically attested beginning with the 14th century. The Ottoman rule was imposed around 1420, and would last for the following four centuries.

===Later history===

The town was first documented under its modern name in 1506 in the Ottoman customs records, described as an &quot;important centre for the transit trade&quot;.

Around 1848, it was still a small shipyard city, being awarded city status in 1860, when it became a province capital. It became a sanjak centre in Silistre Eyaleti in 1860 and Tuna Vilayeti in 1864.

In 1853, &quot;The Times&quot; of London noted that &quot;Toultcha&quot; was &quot;the last fortified place held by the Turks on the Danube, and which has a garrison of 1,200 men.&quot;

During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Northern Dobruja and specially Tulcea would be the sites of massacres and conflicts between Muslim Circassians and Christian Bulgarians, Russians, and Ukrainians. The Circassians of Dobruja had settled there in 1864 after the Circassian genocide, and through their raids to other peoples of the region and handing over part of their gains to the Ottoman authorities, they would end up indirectly financing the construction of buildings that still stand in Tulcea today: the modern Tulcea Art Museum and the Azizyie Mosque. The Dobrujan Circassians were expelled from the region after the end of the war.

In 1878, after the end of the war, Tulcea was awarded to Romania, together with the rest of Northern Dobruja (see Congress of Berlin). Tulcea was occupied by the Central Powers between 1916–1918 during World War I, and became part of their condominium following the Treaty of Bucharest in May 1918 (until November 1918). During that time, the statue of Mircea the Elder was taken down by Bulgarian troops, since it was during his reign that Dobruja was incorporated into Wallachia.

==Climate==
Tulcea&#x27;s climate is transitional between continental and temperate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa/Cfa&quot;), with cold winters and hot summers. Daily minimum temperatures drop below for roughly 79.5 days per year from October to April, with 17.2 days where the daily maximum temperature is also below . Snow cover, on average, is observed for 27.6 days per year.
==Demographics==
At the 2021 census Tulcea had a population of 65,624 with a majority of Romanians (74.83%) with minorities of Lipovans (1.9%), Roma (1.57%), Turks (0.67%), Ukrainians (0.42%), Greeks (0.27%), Bulgarians (0.03%), others (0.38%) and unknown (19.93%). 

At the 2011 census Tulcea had a population of 73,707 with a majority of Romanians (83.37%) with minorities of Lipovans (2.36%), Roma (1.29%), Turks (1.11%), Ukrainians (0.51%), Greeks (0.28%), Bulgarians (0.02%), others (0.53%) and unknown (10.53%).

Most of the indigenous Bulgarians left the city after the Treaty of Craiova.

==Culture==
Tulcea is the site of the &quot;George Georgescu Contest&quot;, a music competition created by teachers at the Tulcea Arts High School and held annually since 1992. Named in honor of the conductor George Georgescu (1887–1964), an important figure in the development of Romanian classical music who was born in the Tulcea county, the contest was at first open only to Romanian music school and high school students but began admitting international students in 1995. Organizers include the Romanian Ministry of Education and Youth, the Education Board of Tulcea County, the Tulcea County Council, the Tulcea Mayoralty, and surviving members of Georgescu&#x27;s family.
The Monument of Independence represents one of the main attractions of the city, because of its placement and of the panoramic view that it offers. It is located on the same hill as the ruins of Aegyssus and the history museum. The monument itself is represented by an obelisk with a statue of an eagle on one side and the statue of a soldier on the other. The monument was erected to commemorate the War of Independence that made Dobruja part of Romania. Construction began on October 17, 1879, in the presence of Prince Carol I of Romania.
The main high school is the Spiru Haret Dobrujan College.

<text>2C-I, also known as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine, is a phenethylamine of the 2C family with psychedelic effects. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin, and is described in Shulgin&#x27;s book &quot;PiHKAL&quot; (1991).

The substance is consumed as a recreational drug, and is circulated in the drug market in a powder form. 2C-I is sometimes confused with other related chemical substances such as 25I-NBOMe (2C-I-NBOMe), nicknamed &quot;Smiles&quot; and &quot;N-bomb&quot; in the media.

== Patterns of use ==
In the early 2000s, 2C-I was sold in Dutch smart shops as a recreational drug after the drug 2C-B was banned.

According to the US Drug Enforcement Administration, 2C-I is taken orally or snorted in a powder form.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
2C-I acts as a serotonin receptor agonist. It produces psychedelic effects via serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation.

2C-I is a highly potent anti-inflammatory drug similarly to various other serotonergic psychedelics. However, 2C-I showed the highest anti-inflammatory potency of any other assessed drug in a large series in one study. It was more potent than (&quot;R&quot;)-DOI in terms of anti-inflammatory activity.

==Legal status==
===European Union===
In December 2003, the European Council issued a binding order compelling all European Union member states to ban 2C-I within three months.

===Canada===
As of October 31, 2016, 2C-I is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

===Australia===
2C-I is a schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A schedule 9 drug is outlined in the Poisons Act 1964 as &quot;Substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of the CEO&quot;.

===Sweden===
&quot;Sveriges riksdag&quot; added 2C-I to schedule I (&quot;substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use&quot;) as a narcotic on March 16, 2004, published by the &quot;Medical Products Agency&quot; in their regulation LVFS 2004:3.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, 2C-I is controlled as a Class A substance.

===United States===
As of July 9, 2012, in the United States 2C-I is a Schedule I substance under the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012, making possession, distribution and manufacture illegal. A previous bill, introduced in March 2011, that would have done the same passed the House of Representatives, but was not passed by the Senate.

<text>Phenethylamine (PEA) is an organic compound, natural monoamine alkaloid, and trace amine, which acts as a central nervous system stimulant in humans. In the brain, phenethylamine regulates monoamine neurotransmission by binding to trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and inhibiting vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in monoamine neurons. To a lesser extent, it also acts as a neurotransmitter in the human central nervous system. In mammals, phenethylamine is produced from the amino acid L-phenylalanine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase via enzymatic decarboxylation. In addition to its presence in mammals, phenethylamine is found in many other organisms and foods, such as chocolate, especially after microbial fermentation.

Phenethylamine is sold as a dietary supplement for purported mood and weight loss-related therapeutic benefits; however, in orally ingested phenethylamine, a significant amount is metabolized in the small intestine by monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) and then aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which converts it to phenylacetic acid. This means that for significant concentrations to reach the brain, the dosage must be higher than for other methods of administration. Some authors have postulated that phenethylamine plays a role in affection without substantiating these claims with any direct evidence.

Phenethylamines, or more properly, substituted phenethylamines, are the group of phenethylamine derivatives that contain phenethylamine as a &quot;backbone&quot;; in other words, this chemical class includes derivative compounds that are formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms in the phenethylamine core structure with substituents. The class of substituted phenethylamines includes all substituted amphetamines, and substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamines (MDxx), and contains many drugs which act as empathogens, stimulants, psychedelics, anorectics, bronchodilators, decongestants, and/or antidepressants, among others.

==Natural occurrence==
Phenethylamine is produced by a wide range of species throughout the plant and animal kingdoms, including humans; it is also produced by certain fungi and bacteria (genera: &quot;Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Pseudomonas&quot; and the family Enterobacteriaceae) and acts as a potent antimicrobial against certain pathogenic strains of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (e.g., the O157:H7 strain) at sufficient concentrations.

==Chemistry==
Phenethylamine is a primary amine, the amino-group being attached to a benzene ring through a two-carbon, or ethyl group. It is a colourless liquid at room temperature that has a fishy odor, and is soluble in water, ethanol and ether. Its density is 0.964 g/ml and its boiling point is 195 °C. Upon exposure to air, it combines with carbon dioxide to form a solid carbonate salt. Phenethylamine is strongly basic, pKb = 4.17 (or pKa = 9.83), as measured using the HCl salt, and forms a stable crystalline hydrochloride salt with a melting point of 217 °C. Its experimental log P is 1.41.

===Substituted derivatives===
Substituted phenethylamines are a chemical class of organic compounds based upon the phenethylamine structure; the class is composed of all the derivative compounds of phenethylamine which can be formed by replacing, or substituting, one or more hydrogen atoms in the phenethylamine core structure with substituents.

Many substituted phenethylamines are psychoactive drugs, which belong to a variety of different drug classes, including central nervous system stimulants (e.g., amphetamine), hallucinogens (e.g., 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine), entactogens (e.g., 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine), appetite suppressants (e.g. phentermine), nasal decongestants and bronchodilators (e.g., pseudoephedrine), antidepressants (e.g. bupropion), antiparkinson agents (e.g., selegiline), and vasopressors (e.g., ephedrine), among others. Many of these psychoactive compounds exert their pharmacological effects primarily by modulating monoamine neurotransmitter systems; however, there is no mechanism of action or biological target that is common to all members of this subclass.

Numerous endogenous compounds – including hormones, monoamine neurotransmitters, and many trace amines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine, adrenaline, tyramine, and others) – are substituted phenethylamines. Dopamine 
is simply phenethylamine with a hydroxyl group attached to the 3 and 4 position of the benzene ring. Several notable recreational drugs, such as MDMA (ecstasy), methamphetamine, and cathinones, are also members of the class. All of the substituted amphetamines are phenethylamines, as well.

Pharmaceutical drugs that are substituted phenethylamines include phenelzine, phenformin, and fanetizole, among many others.

The &quot;N&quot;-methylated derivative of phenethylamine is &quot;N&quot;-methylphenethylamine.

===Analogues===
Analogues of phenethylamine with the ethylamine side chain extended or shortened include phenylpropylamine and benzylamine. Another related analogue is phenylalaninol.

===Synthesis===
One method for preparing β-phenethylamine, set forth in J. C. Robinson and H. R. Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Organic Syntheses&quot; (published 1955), involves the reduction of benzyl cyanide with hydrogen in liquid ammonia, in the presence of a Raney-Nickel catalyst, at a temperature of 130 °C and a pressure of 13.8 MPa. Alternative syntheses are outlined in the footnotes to this preparation.

A much more convenient method for the synthesis of β-phenethylamine is the reduction of ω-nitrostyrene by lithium aluminium hydride in ether, whose successful execution was first reported by R. F. Nystrom and W. G. Brown in 1948.

Phenethylamine can also be produced via the cathodic reduction of benzyl cyanide in a divided cell.
Assembling phenethylamine structures for synthesis of compounds such as epinephrine, amphetamines, tyrosine, and dopamine by adding the beta-aminoethyl side chain to the phenyl ring is possible. This can be done via Friedel-Crafts acylation with N-protected acyl chlorides when the arene is activated, or by Heck reaction of the phenyl with N-vinyloxazolone, followed by hydrogenation, or by cross-coupling with beta-amino organozinc reagents, or reacting a brominated arene with beta-aminoethyl organolithium reagents, or by Suzuki cross-coupling.

===Detection in body fluids===
Reviews that cover attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and phenethylamine indicate that several studies have found abnormally low urinary phenethylamine concentrations in ADHD individuals when compared with controls. In treatment-responsive individuals, amphetamine and methylphenidate greatly increase urinary phenethylamine concentration. An ADHD biomarker review also indicated that urinary phenethylamine levels could be a diagnostic biomarker for ADHD.

Thirty minutes of moderate- to high-intensity physical exercise has been shown to induce an increase in urinary phenylacetic acid, the primary metabolite of phenethylamine. Two reviews noted a study where the mean 24 hour urinary phenylacetic acid concentration following just 30 minutes of intense exercise rose 77% above its base level; the reviews suggest that phenethylamine synthesis sharply increases during physical exercise during which it is rapidly metabolized due to its short half-life of roughly 30 seconds. In a resting state, phenethylamine is synthesized in catecholamine neurons from -phenylalanine by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase at approximately the same rate as dopamine is produced. Monoamine oxidase deaminates primary and secondary amines that are free in the neuronal cytoplasm but not those bound in storage vesicles of the sympathetic neurone. Similarly, β-PEA would not be completely deaminated in the gut as it is a selective substrate for MAO-B, which is not primarily found in the gut. Brain levels of endogenous trace amines are several hundred-fold below those for the classical neurotransmitters noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin, but their rates of synthesis are equivalent to those of noradrenaline and dopamine and they have a very rapid turnover rate. Endogenous extracellular tissue levels of trace amines measured in the brain are in the low nanomolar range. These low concentrations arise because of their very short half-life. Because of the pharmacological relationship between phenethylamine and amphetamine, the original paper and both reviews suggest that phenethylamine plays a prominent role in mediating the mood-enhancing euphoric effects of a runner&#x27;s high, as both phenethylamine and amphetamine are potent euphoriants.

Skydiving has also been shown to induce a marked increase in urinary phenethylamine concentrations.

==Biological activity==


===Monoamine releasing agent===
Phenethylamine, being similar to amphetamine in its action at their common biomolecular targets, is a releasing agent of norepinephrine and dopamine. It is roughly equipotent to amphetamine in this regard &quot;in vitro&quot;. Phenethylamine is inactive as a psychostimulant under normal circumstances due to rapid metabolism by monoamine oxidase (MAO), but can become active in the presence of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI).

===TAAR1 agonist===
Phenethylamine is a potent agonist of the mouse, rat, and human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). β-PEA is also an odorant binding TAAR4 in mice thought to mediate predator avoidance. Similarly to the case of amphetamine, phenethylamine shows enhanced locomotor stimulation, a psychostimulant-like effect, in TAAR1 knockout mice.

===Monoaminergic activity enhancer===
Phenethylamine is a monoaminergic activity enhancer (MAE) of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in addition to its catecholamine-releasing activity. That is, it enhances the action potential-mediated release of these monoamine neurotransmitters. The compound is active as a MAE at much lower concentrations than the concentrations at which it induces the release of catecholamines. The MAE actions of phenethylamine and other MAEs may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. Synthetic and more potent MAEs like phenylpropylaminopentane (PPAP) and selegiline (-deprenyl) have been derived from phenethylamine.

===Other activities===
Unlike its derivatives norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), phenethylamine is inactive as an agonist of the α- and β-adrenergic receptors.

===Effects in animals and humans===
According to Alexander Shulgin in PiHKAL, phenethylamine is completely inactive in humans at doses of up to 1,600mg orally and 50mg intravenously. This can be attributed to its extremely rapid metabolic breakdown rather than pharmacodynamic inactivity.

Although exogenous phenethylamine on its own is inactive, its metabolism can be strongly inhibited and it can thereby become active, showing psychostimulant effects, when combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), specifically monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors like selegiline. Oral -phenylalanine (a precursor of phenethylamine) and/or phenethylamine itself in combination with selegiline has been studied in the treatment of depression and has been reported to be effective. Misuse of phenethylamine in combination with selegiline has also been reported.

The values of phenethylamine include 175mg/kg i.p. in mice, 320mg/kg s.c. in mice, 100mg/kg i.v. in mice, 100mg/kg parenterally in mice, 39mg/kg intracervically in mice, and 200mg/kg i.p. in guinea pigs. Its  values include 800mg/kg p.o. in rats, 100mg/kg i.p. in rats, 450μg/kg s.c. in rats, and 300mg/kg via an unspecified route in mice.

==Pharmacokinetics==

By oral route, phenethylamine&#x27;s half-life is  minutes; endogenously produced PEA in catecholamine neurons has a half-life of roughly 30 seconds. In humans, PEA is metabolized by phenylethanolamine &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (PNMT), monoamine oxidase A (), monoamine oxidase B (), the semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases (SSAOs) AOC2 and AOC3, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), and aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT). , an isomer of amphetamine, is produced in humans via the metabolism of phenethylamine by PNMT. β-Phenylacetic acid is the primary urinary metabolite of phenethylamine and is produced via monoamine oxidase metabolism and subsequent aldehyde dehydrogenase metabolism. Phenylacetaldehyde is the intermediate product which is produced by monoamine oxidase and then further metabolized into β-phenylacetic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase.

When the initial phenylethylamine concentration in the brain is low, brain levels can be increased when taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), particularly a MAO-B inhibitor, and by  times when the initial concentration is high.

<text>In biology, a reflex, or reflex action, is an involuntary, unplanned sequence or action and nearly instantaneous response to a stimulus.

Reflexes are found with varying levels of complexity in organisms with a nervous system. A reflex occurs via neural pathways in the nervous system called reflex arcs. A stimulus initiates a neural signal, which is carried to a synapse. The signal is then transferred across the synapse to a motor neuron, which evokes a target response. These neural signals do not always travel to the brain, so many reflexes are an automatic response to a stimulus that does not receive or need conscious thought.

Many reflexes are fine-tuned to increase organism survival and self-defense. This is observed in reflexes such as the startle reflex, which provides an automatic response to an unexpected stimulus, and the feline righting reflex, which reorients a cat&#x27;s body when falling to ensure safe landing. The simplest type of reflex, a short-latency reflex, has a single synapse, or junction, in the signaling pathway. Long-latency reflexes produce nerve signals that are transduced across multiple synapses before generating the reflex response.

==Types of human reflexes==
===Autonomic vs skeletal reflexes===
&quot;Reflex&quot; is an anatomical concept and it refers to a 
loop consisting, in its simplest form, of a sensory
nerve, the input, and a motor nerve, the output. 
Autonomic does not mean automatic. The term &quot;autonomic&quot; is an anatomical term and it refers 
to a type of nervous system in animals and humans 
that is very primitive. &quot;Skeletal&quot; or &quot;somatic&quot; are, 
similarly, anatomical terms that refer to a type of
nervous system that is more recent in terms of 
evolutionary development. There are autonomic 
reflexes and skeletal, somatic reflexes.

===Myotatic reflexes===

The myotatic or muscle stretch reflexes (sometimes known as &quot;deep tendon reflexes&quot;) provide information on the integrity of the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. This information can be detected using electromyography (EMG). Generally, decreased reflexes indicate a peripheral problem, and lively or exaggerated reflexes a central one. A stretch reflex is the contraction of a muscle in response to its lengthwise stretch.
* Biceps reflex (C5, C6)
* Brachioradialis reflex (C5, C6, C7)
* Extensor digitorum reflex (C6, C7)
* Triceps reflex (C6, C7, C8)
* Patellar reflex or knee-jerk reflex (L2, L3, L4)
* Ankle jerk reflex (Achilles reflex) (S1, S2)

While the reflexes above are stimulated mechanically, the term H-reflex refers to the analogous reflex stimulated electrically, and tonic vibration reflex for those stimulated to vibration.

===Tendon reflex===
A tendon reflex is the contraction of a muscle in response to striking its tendon. The Golgi tendon reflex is the inverse of a stretch reflex.

===Reflexes involving cranial nerves===

===Reflexes usually only observed in human infants===
Newborn babies have a number of other reflexes which are not seen in adults, referred to as primitive reflexes. These automatic reactions to stimuli enable infants to respond to the environment before any learning has taken place. They include:
* Asymmetrical tonic neck reflex
* Palmomental reflex
* Moro reflex, also known as the startle reflex
* Palmar grasp reflex
* Rooting reflex
* Sucking reflex
* Symmetrical tonic neck reflex
* Tonic labyrinthine reflex

===Other kinds of reflexes===
Other reflexes found in the central nervous system include:
* Abdominal reflexes (T6-L1)
* Gastrocolic reflex
* Anocutaneous reflex (S2-S4)
* Baroreflex
* Cough reflex
* Cremasteric reflex (L1-L2)
* Diving reflex
* Lazarus sign
* Muscular defense
* Photic sneeze reflex
* Scratch reflex
* Sneeze
* Startle response
* Withdrawal reflex
** Crossed extensor reflex
Many of these reflexes are quite complex, requiring a number of synapses in a number of different nuclei in the central nervous system (e.g., the escape reflex). Others of these involve just a couple of synapses to function (e.g., the withdrawal reflex).
Processes such as breathing, digestion, and the maintenance of the heartbeat can also be regarded as reflex actions, according to some definitions of the term.

==Grading==

In medicine, reflexes are often used to assess the health of the nervous system. Doctors will typically grade the activity of a reflex on a scale from 0 to 4. While 2+ is considered normal, some healthy individuals are hypo-reflexive and register all reflexes at 1+, while others are hyper-reflexive and register all reflexes at 3+.
Depending on where you are, another way of grading is from –4 (absent) to +4 (clonus), where 0 is &quot;normal&quot;.

== Reflex modulation ==

Some might imagine that reflexes are immutable. In reality, however, most reflexes are flexible and can be substantially modified to match the requirements of the behavior in both vertebrates and invertebrates.

A good example of reflex modulation is the stretch reflex. When a muscle is stretched at rest, the stretch reflex leads to contraction of the muscle, thereby opposing stretch (resistance reflex). This helps to stabilize posture. During voluntary movements, however, the intensity (gain) of the reflex is reduced or its sign is even reversed. This prevents resistance reflexes from impeding movements.

The underlying sites and mechanisms of reflex modulation are not fully understood. There is evidence that the output of sensory neurons is directly modulated during behavior—for example, through presynaptic inhibition. The effect of sensory input upon motor neurons is also influenced by interneurons in the spinal cord or ventral nerve cord and by descending signals from the brain.

==Other reflexes==
Breathing can also be considered both involuntary and voluntary, since breath can be held through internal intercostal muscles.

== History ==

The concept of reflexes dates back to the 17th century with René Descartes. Descartes introduced the idea in his work &quot;Treatise on Man&quot;, published posthumously in 1664. He described how the body could perform actions automatically in response to external stimuli without conscious thought. Descartes used the analogy of a mechanical statue to explain how sensory input could trigger motor responses in a deterministic and automatic manner.

The term &quot;reflex&quot; was introduced in the 19th century by the English physiologist Marshall Hall, who is credited with formulating the concept of reflex action and explaining it scientifically. He introduced the term to describe involuntary movements triggered by external stimuli, which are mediated by the spinal cord and the nervous system, distinct from voluntary movements controlled by the brain. Hall&#x27;s significant work on reflex function was detailed in his 1833 paper, &quot;On the Reflex Function of the Medulla Oblongata and Medulla Spinalis,&quot; published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, where he provided a clear account of how reflex actions were mediated by the spinal cord, independent of the brain&#x27;s conscious control, distinguishing them from other neural activities.

<doc id="381196" wikidata="Q801431" url="?curid=381196" title="Shadwell DLR station">
<text>Shadwell is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in Shadwell in east London, England and is between the terminals of Bank and Tower Gateway to the west and Limehouse to the east. The 1991 Bank extension joins the main DLR line just to the west of Shadwell. It is located near Shadwell railway station for London Overground services, in Travelcard Zone 2.

==History==
This station opened on 31 August 1987 as part of the first tranche of DLR stations. It is located 50 yards to the west of an earlier station that was first called Shadwell and then renamed Shadwell &amp; St. George&#x27;s East, serving the slow lines of the London, Tilbury &amp; Southend Railway that this section of the DLR replaced.

Initially designed for one-car DLR trains, Shadwell&#x27;s platform was extended for two-car operation in 1991. The station was refurbished in 2009: the platforms were extended to accommodate three-car trains, the station entrance at ground level was altered, and an emergency exit was added at the east end of the platforms.

==Location==
The station stands on a viaduct and consists of a single island platform serving trains in both directions. The ticket machines and entrance are at ground level to the west of the island platforms, facing onto Watney Street. The station is usually unstaffed, like most stations on the DLR. There is a crossover west of the station which allows trains from Westferry, Bank or Tower Gateway to reverse here.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 100, 339 and D3 serve the station.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Shadwell is:
* 6 tph to Tower Gateway
* 18 tph to Bank
* 6 tph to Beckton
* 6 tph to 
* 12 tph to via Canary Wharf

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the total service to up to 30 tph in each direction.

<doc id="381207" wikidata="Q241584" url="?curid=381207" title="Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester">
<text>Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester (born Birgitte Eva van Deurs Henriksen; 20 June 1946) is a Danish-born member of the British royal family. She is married to Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, a grandson of King George V.

==Early life and education==
Birgitte Eva van Deurs Henriksen was born in Odense, Denmark, the younger daughter of Asger Preben Wissing Henriksen, a lawyer, and his wife, Vivian van Deurs. She was educated in Odense and at finishing schools in Lausanne and Cambridge. She took her mother&#x27;s ancestral name van Deurs on 15 January 1966, after her parents&#x27; separation. After completing a three-year course in Commercial and Economic Studies in Copenhagen, she moved back to the United Kingdom in 1971 to work as a secretary at the Royal Danish Embassy in London.

==Marriage and family==

Van Deurs Henriksen first met Prince Richard of Gloucester, the younger son of Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, in the late 1960s in Cambridge, where he attended university. In February 1972, their engagement was announced. They married on 8 July 1972 at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Barnwell, Northamptonshire. The bride&#x27;s wedding dress was designed by Norman Hartnell. It was constructed of Swiss organdie, with a high collar, a simple skirt, long sleeves and a small train. Instead of wearing a tiara, she wore stephanotis flowers on her hair which secured the veil. Upon marriage, she assumed the style &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Richard of Gloucester&quot;.

Six weeks after their wedding, Prince Richard&#x27;s elder brother, Prince William of Gloucester, was killed in a flying accident. Prince Richard unexpectedly became heir apparent to the dukedom and upon his father&#x27;s death in 1974, the couple became the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.

The couple have three children: Alexander (born 1974), Davina (born 1977), and Rose (born 1980). They were born at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, London. The Duke and Duchess officially reside at Kensington Palace.

==Activities==
The Duchess of Gloucester has accompanied the Duke of Gloucester on his official visits overseas: her first visit was in 1973, when they represented the Queen at the 70th birthday celebrations of King Olav V of Norway. Other joint visits have included Australia, Belgium, China, Denmark, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Luxembourg, Nepal, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Tonga, Tunisia and the United States. Birgitte has also travelled overseas in support of her own patronages and military units, including a visit to Iraq in December 2008.

She and her husband represented the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the state funeral of King Tāufaāhau Tupou IV of Tonga on 19 September 2006. They also represented the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the coronation of King George Tupou V of Tonga on 1 August 2008 in Nukuʻalofa.
Birgitte is sponsor of two Royal Navy ships: and . She is also the royal patron of the Bermuda Regiment. She is patron of SeeAbility, a charity for people with learning disabilities and sight loss; The Lullaby Trust, a baby charity aiming to prevent unexpected deaths in infancy and promote infant health; and Music in Hospitals &amp; Care. She regularly attends functions at schools of which she is president or patron: St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral School; the Friends of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral; the Cathedral Music Trust; St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead; Bridewell Royal Hospital (King Edward&#x27;s School, Witley); the Royal Alexandra and Albert School; the Children&#x27;s Society; Parkinson&#x27;s UK; Hope for Youth Northern Ireland; Scottish Opera; Lawn Tennis Association; the Royal School of Needlework; Turn2us; Missing People; and Princess Helena College. After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, Birgitte became president of the Royal Academy of Music. She is also the patron of Prostate Cancer UK, and in March 2006, she opened the Prostate Centre.

<text>Heron Quays is a light metro station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) Bank to Lewisham Line in the Heron Quays area of Canary Wharf in East London. The station is situated on the Isle of Dogs and serves the southern part of the Canary Wharf office complex and is directly connected to the Jubilee Place underground shopping centre. The station is elevated and contained within one of the complex&#x27;s office towers. It has an out of station interchange (OSI) for Canary Wharf Underground station on London Underground&#x27;s Jubilee line. Through ticketing is allowed between both stations.

The station is in Travelcard Zone 2, and is on the Lewisham branch of the Docklands Light Railway, between Canary Wharf and South Quay.

==History== 
Originally open-air, the station was reconstructed in 2001-2002 (to fit inside a new high-rise development by Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers). Longer platforms were built to accommodate three-unit trains planned as part of the DLR Capacity Enhancement. Designed by Alsop Architects, the station re-opened on 18 December 2002.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Heron Quays is:
* 12 tph to Bank
* 12 tph to 

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the service to up to 22 tph in each direction, with up to 8 tph during the peak hours running to and from instead of Bank.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 135, D3, D8 and night route N550 serve the station.

<text>Open access (OA) is a set of principles and a range of practices through which nominally copyrightable publications are delivered to readers free of access charges or other barriers. With open access strictly defined (according to the 2001 definition), or libre open access, barriers to copying or reuse are also reduced or removed by applying an open license for copyright, which regulates post-publication uses of the work.

The main focus of the open access movement has been on &quot;peer reviewed research literature&quot;, and more specifically on academic journals. This is because:

* such publications have been a subject of serials crisis, unlike newspapers, magazines and fiction writing. The main difference between these two groups is in demand elasticity: whereas an English literature curriculum can substitute &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; with a free-domain alternative, such as &quot;A Voyage to Lilliput,&quot; an emergency room physician treating a patient for a life-threatening urushiol poisoning cannot substitute the most recent, but paywalled review article on this topic with a 90 year-old copyright-expired article that was published before the invention of prednisone in 1954.

* the authors of research papers are not paid in any way, so they do not suffer any monetary losses, when they switch from behind paywall to open access publishing, especially, if they use diamond open access media.

* the cost of electronic publishing, which has been the main form of distribution of journal articles since , is incommensurably smaller, than the cost of on-paper publishing and distribution, which is still preferred by many readers of fiction.

Whereas non-open access journals cover publishing costs through access tolls such as subscriptions, site licenses or pay-per-view charges, open-access journals are characterised by funding models which do not require the reader to pay to read the journal&#x27;s contents, relying instead on author fees or on public funding, subsidies and sponsorships. Open access can be applied to all forms of published research output, including peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed academic journal articles, conference papers, theses, book chapters, monographs, research reports and images.

== Definitions ==
There are different models of open access publishing and publishers may use one or more of these models.

=== Colour naming system ===
Different open access types are currently commonly described using a colour system. The most commonly recognised names are &quot;green&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;, and &quot;hybrid&quot; open access; however, several other models and alternative terms are also used.

==== Gold OA ====
In the gold OA model, the publisher makes all articles and related content available for free immediately on the journal&#x27;s website. In such publications, articles are licensed for sharing and reuse via Creative Commons licenses or similar.
Many gold OA publishers charge an article processing charge (APC), which is typically paid through institutional or grant funding. The majority of gold open access journals charging APCs follow an &quot;author-pays&quot; model,
although this is not an intrinsic property of gold OA.

==== Green OA ====

Self-archiving by authors is permitted under green OA. Independently from publication by a publisher, the author also posts the work to a website controlled by the author, the research institution that funded or hosted the work, or to an independent central open repository, where people can download the work without paying.

Green OA is free of charge for the author. Some publishers (less than 5% and decreasing as of 2014) may charge a fee for an additional service such as a free license on the publisher-authored copyrightable portions of the printed version of an article.

If the author posts the near-final version of their work after peer review by a journal, the archived version is called a &quot;postprint&quot;. This can be the accepted manuscript as returned by the journal to the author after successful peer review.

==== Hybrid OA ====
Hybrid open-access journals contain a mixture of open access articles and closed access articles. A publisher following this model is partially funded by subscriptions, and only provide open access for those individual articles for which the authors (or research sponsor) pay a publication fee. Hybrid OA generally costs more than gold OA and can offer a lower quality of service. A particularly controversial practice in hybrid open access journals is &quot;double dipping&quot;, where both authors and subscribers are charged. For these reasons, hybrid open access journals have been called a &quot;Mephistophelian invention&quot;, and publishing in hybrid OA journals often do not qualify for funding under open access mandates, as libraries already pay for subscriptions thus have no financial incentive to fund open access articles in such journals.

==== Bronze OA ====
Bronze open access articles are free to read only on the publisher page, but lack a clearly identifiable license. Such articles are typically not available for reuse.

==== Diamond/platinum OA ====

Journals that publish open access without charging authors article processing charges are sometimes referred to as diamond or platinum OA. Since they do not charge either readers or authors directly, such publishers often require funding from external sources such as the sale of advertisements, academic institutions, learned societies, philanthropists or government grants. There are now over 350 platinum OA journals with impact factors over a wide variety of academic disciplines, giving most academics options for OA with no APCs. Diamond OA journals are available for most disciplines, and are usually small (&lt;25 articles per year) and more likely to be multilingual (38%); thousands of such journals exist.

==== Black OA ====

The growth of unauthorized digital copying by large-scale copyright infringement has enabled free access to paywalled literature. This has been done via existing social media sites (e.g. the #ICanHazPDF hashtag) as well as dedicated sites (e.g. Sci-Hub). In some ways this is a large-scale technical implementation of pre-existing practice, whereby those with access to paywalled literature would share copies with their contacts. However, the increased ease and scale from 2010 onwards have changed how many people treat subscription publications.

=== Gratis and libre ===

Similar to the free content definition, the terms &#x27;gratis&#x27; and &#x27;libre&#x27; were used in the Budapest Open Access Initiative definition to distinguish between free to read versus free to reuse.

Gratis open access () refers to free online access, to read, free of charge, without re-use rights.

Libre open access () also refers to free online access, to read, free of charge, plus some additional re-use rights, covering the kinds of open access defined in the Budapest Open Access Initiative, the Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing and the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities. The re-use rights of libre OA are often specified by various specific Creative Commons licenses; all of which require as a minimum attribution of authorship to the original authors. In 2012, the number of works under libre open access was considered to have been rapidly increasing for a few years, though most open-access mandates did not enforce any copyright license and it was difficult to publish libre gold OA in legacy journals. However, there are no costs nor restrictions for green libre OA as preprints can be freely self-deposited with a free license, and most open-access repositories use Creative Commons licenses to allow reuse. The biggest drawback of many Open Access licenses is a prohibition on data mining. For this reason, many big data studies of various technologies performed by economists ( as well as machine learning by computer scientists) are limited to patent analysis, since the patent documents are not subject to copyright at all.

=== FAIR ===

FAIR is an acronym for &#x27;findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable&#x27;, intended to more clearly define what is meant by the term &#x27;open access&#x27; and make the concept easier to discuss. Initially proposed in March 2016, it has subsequently been endorsed by organisations such as the European Commission and the G20. Note, however, that FAIR principles include &quot;A1.2: The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure where necessary.&quot; This means that a FAIR dataset may be either closed (restricted access) or open (no access restrictions). So, only FAIR data without access restrictions are open access.

== Features ==

The emergence of open science or open research has brought to light a number of controversial and hotly-debated topics.

Scholarly publishing invokes various positions and passions. For example, authors may spend hours struggling with diverse article submission systems, often converting document formatting between a multitude of journal and conference styles, and sometimes spend months waiting for peer review results. The drawn-out and often contentious societal and technological transition to Open Access and Open Science/Open Research, particularly across North America and Europe (Latin America has already widely adopted &quot;Acceso Abierto&quot; since before 2000) has led to increasingly entrenched positions and much debate.

The area of (open) scholarly practices increasingly sees a role for policy-makers and research funders giving focus to issues such as career incentives, research evaluation and business models for publicly funded research. Plan S and AmeliCA (Open Knowledge for Latin America) caused a wave of debate in scholarly communication in 2019 and 2020.

=== Licenses ===

Subscription-based publishing typically requires transfer of copyright from authors to the publisher so that the latter can monetise the process via dissemination and reproduction of the work. With OA publishing, typically authors retain copyright to their work, and license its reproduction to the publisher. Retention of copyright by authors can support academic freedoms by enabling greater control of the work (e.g. for image re-use) or licensing agreements (e.g. to allow dissemination by others).

The most common licenses used in open access publishing are Creative Commons. The widely used CC BY license is one of the most permissive, only requiring attribution to be allowed to use the material (and allowing derivations and commercial use). A range of more restrictive Creative Commons licenses are also used. More rarely, some of the smaller academic journals use custom open access licenses. Some publishers (e.g. Elsevier) use &quot;author nominal copyright&quot; for OA articles, where the author retains copyright in name only and all rights are transferred to the publisher.

=== Funding ===
Since open access publication does not charge readers, there are many financial models used to cover costs by other means. Open access can be provided by commercial publishers, who may publish open access as well as subscription-based journals, or dedicated open-access publishers such as Public Library of Science (PLOS) and BioMed Central. Another source of funding for open access can be institutional subscribers. One example of this is the Subscribe to Open publishing model introduced by Annual Reviews; if the subscription revenue goal is met, the given journal&#x27;s volume is published open access.

Advantages and disadvantages of open access have generated considerable discussion amongst researchers, academics, librarians, university administrators, funding agencies, government officials, commercial publishers, editorial staff and society publishers. Reactions of existing publishers to open access journal publishing have ranged from moving with enthusiasm to a new open access business model, to experiments with providing as much free or open access as possible, to active lobbying against open access proposals. There are many publishers that started up as open access-only publishers, such as PLOS, Hindawi Publishing Corporation, Frontiers in... journals, MDPI and BioMed Central.

==== Article processing charges ====

Some open access journals (under the gold, and hybrid models) generate revenue by charging publication fees in order to make the work openly available at the time of publication. The money might come from the author but more often comes from the author&#x27;s research grant or employer. While the payments are typically incurred &quot;per article published&quot; (e.g. BMC or PLOS journals), some journals apply them &quot;per manuscript submitted&quot; (e.g. &quot;Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics&quot; until recently) or &quot;per author&quot; (e.g. PeerJ).

Charges typically range from $1,000–$3,000 ($5,380 for Nature Communications) but can be under $10, close to $5,000 or well over $10,000. APCs vary greatly depending on subject and region and are most common in scientific and medical journals (43% and 47% respectively), and lowest in arts and humanities journals (0% and 4% respectively). APCs can also depend on a journal&#x27;s impact factor. Some publishers (e.g. eLife and Ubiquity Press) have released estimates of their direct and indirect costs that set their APCs. Hybrid OA generally costs more than gold OA and can offer a lower quality of service. A particularly controversial practice in hybrid open access journals is &quot;double dipping&quot;, where both authors and subscribers are charged.

By comparison, journal subscriptions equate to $3,500–$4,000 per article published by an institution, but are highly variable by publisher (and some charge page fees separately). This has led to the assessment that there is enough money &quot;within the system&quot; to enable full transition to OA. However, there is ongoing discussion about whether the change-over offers an opportunity to become more cost-effective or promotes more equitable participation in publication. Concern has been noted that increasing subscription journal prices will be mirrored by rising APCs, creating a barrier to less financially privileged authors.

The inherent bias of the current APC-based OA publishing perpetuates this inequality through the &#x27;Matthew effect&#x27; (the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer). The switch from pay-to-read to pay-to-publish has left essentially the same people behind, with some academics not having enough purchasing power (individually or through their institutions) for either option. Some gold OA publishers will waive all or part of the fee for authors from less developed economies. Steps are normally taken to ensure that peer reviewers do not know whether authors have requested, or been granted, fee waivers, or to ensure that every paper is approved by an independent editor with no financial stake in the journal. The main argument against requiring authors to pay a fee, is the risk to the peer review system, diminishing the overall quality of scientific journal publishing.

====Subsidized or no-fee====
No-fee open access journals, also known as &quot;platinum&quot; or &quot;diamond&quot; do not charge either readers or authors. These journals use a variety of business models including subsidies, advertising, membership dues, endowments, or volunteer labour. Subsidising sources range from universities, libraries and museums to foundations, societies or government agencies. Some publishers may cross-subsidise from other publications or auxiliary services and products. For example, most APC-free journals in Latin America are funded by higher education institutions and are not conditional on institutional affiliation for publication. Conversely, Knowledge Unlatched crowdsources funding in order to make monographs available open access.

Estimates of prevalence vary, but approximately 10,000 journals without APC are listed in DOAJ and the Free Journal Network. APC-free journals tend to be smaller and more local-regional in scope. Some also require submitting authors to have a particular institutional affiliation.

=== Preprint use ===
A &quot;preprint&quot; is typically a version of a research paper that is shared on an online platform prior to, or during, a formal peer review process. Preprint platforms have become popular due to the increasing drive towards open access publishing and can be publisher- or community-led. A range of discipline-specific or cross-domain platforms now exist. The posting of pre-prints (and/or authors&#x27; manuscript versions) is consistent with the Green Open Access model.

==== Effect of preprints on later publication ====

A persistent concern surrounding preprints is that work may be at risk of being plagiarised or &quot;scooped&quot; – meaning that the same or similar research will be published by others without proper attribution to the original source – if publicly available but not yet associated with a stamp of approval from peer reviewers and traditional journals. These concerns are often amplified as competition increases for academic jobs and funding, and perceived to be particularly problematic for early-career researchers and other higher-risk demographics within academia.

However, preprints, in fact, protect against scooping. Considering the differences between traditional peer-review based publishing models and deposition of an article on a preprint server, &quot;scooping&quot; is less likely for manuscripts first submitted as preprints. In a traditional publishing scenario, the time from manuscript submission to acceptance and to final publication can range from a few weeks to years, and go through several rounds of revision and resubmission before final publication. During this time, the same work will have been extensively discussed with external collaborators, presented at conferences, and been read by editors and reviewers in related areas of research. Yet, there is no official open record of that process (e.g., peer reviewers are normally anonymous, reports remain largely unpublished), and if an identical or very similar paper were to be published while the original was still under review, it would be impossible to establish provenance.

Preprints provide a time-stamp at the time of publication, which helps to establish the &quot;priority of discovery&quot; for scientific claims. This means that a preprint can act as proof of provenance for research ideas, data, code, models, and results. The fact that the majority of preprints come with a form of permanent identifier, usually a digital object identifier (DOI), also makes them easy to cite and track. Thus, if one were to be &quot;scooped&quot; without adequate acknowledgement, this would be a case of academic misconduct and plagiarism, and could be pursued as such.

There is no evidence that &quot;scooping&quot; of research via preprints exists, not even in communities that have broadly adopted the use of the arXiv server for sharing preprints since 1991. If the unlikely case of scooping emerges as the growth of the preprint system continues, it can be dealt with as academic malpractice. ASAPbio includes a series of hypothetical scooping scenarios as part of its preprint FAQ, finding that the overall benefits of using preprints vastly outweigh any potential issues around scooping. Indeed, the benefits of preprints, especially for early-career researchers, seem to outweigh any perceived risk: rapid sharing of academic research, open access without author-facing charges, establishing priority of discoveries, receiving wider feedback in parallel with or before peer review, and facilitating wider collaborations.

=== Archiving ===

The &quot;green&quot; route to OA refers to author self-archiving, in which a version of the article (often the peer-reviewed version before editorial typesetting, called &quot;postprint&quot;) is posted online to an institutional and/or subject repository. This route is often dependent on journal or publisher policies, which can be more restrictive and complicated than respective &quot;gold&quot; policies regarding deposit location, license, and embargo requirements. Some publishers require an embargo period before deposition in public repositories, arguing that immediate self-archiving risks loss of subscription income.

==== Embargo periods ====
 Embargoes are imposed by between 20 and 40% of journals, during which time an article is paywalled before permitting self-archiving (green OA) or releasing a free-to-read version (bronze OA). Embargo periods typically vary from 6–12 months in STEM and &gt;12 months in humanities, arts and social sciences. Embargo-free self-archiving has not been shown to affect subscription revenue, and tends to increase readership and citations. Embargoes have been lifted on particular topics for either limited times or ongoing (e.g. Zika outbreaks or indigenous health). Plan S includes zero-length embargoes on self-archiving as a key principle.

== Motivations ==

Open access (mostly green and gratis) began to be sought and provided worldwide by researchers when the possibility itself was opened by the advent of Internet and the World Wide Web. The momentum was further increased by a growing movement for academic journal publishing reform, and with it gold and libre OA.

The premises behind open access publishing are that there are viable funding models to maintain traditional peer review standards of quality while also making the following changes:
* Rather than making journal articles accessible through a subscription business model, all academic publications could be made free to read and published with some other cost-recovery model, such as publication charges, subsidies, or charging subscriptions only for the print edition, with the online edition gratis or &quot;free to read&quot;.
* Rather than applying traditional notions of copyright to academic publications, they could be or &quot;free to build upon&quot;.

An obvious advantage of open access journals is the free access to scientific papers regardless of affiliation with a subscribing library and improved access for the general public; this is especially true in developing countries. Lower costs for research in academia and industry have been claimed in the Budapest Open Access Initiative, although others have argued that OA may raise the total cost of publication, and further increase economic incentives for exploitation in academic publishing. The open access movement is motivated by the problems of social inequality caused by restricting access to academic research, which favor large and wealthy institutions with the financial means to purchase access to many journals, as well as the economic challenges and perceived unsustainability of academic publishing.

=== Stakeholders and concerned communities ===

The intended audience of research articles is usually other researchers. Open access helps researchers as readers by opening up access to articles that their libraries do not subscribe to. All researchers benefit from open access as no library can afford to subscribe to every scientific journal and most can only afford a small fraction of them – this is known as the &quot;serials crisis&quot;.

Open access extends the reach of research beyond its immediate academic circle. An open access article can be read by anyone – a professional in the field, a researcher in another field, a journalist, a politician or civil servant, or an interested layperson. Indeed, a 2008 study revealed that mental health professionals are roughly twice as likely to read a relevant article if it is freely available.

==== Research funders ====

Research funding agencies and universities want to ensure that the research they fund and support in various ways has the greatest possible research impact. As a means of achieving this, research funders are beginning to expect open access to the research they support. Many of them (including all UK Research Councils) have already adopted open-access mandates, and others are on the way to do so (see ROARMAP).

==== Universities ====
A growing number of universities are providing institutional repositories in which their researchers can deposit their published articles. Some open access advocates believe that institutional repositories will play a very important role in responding to open-access mandates from funders.

In May 2005, 16 major Dutch universities cooperatively launched DAREnet, the Digital Academic Repositories, making over 47,000 research papers available. From 2 June 2008, DAREnet has been incorporated into the scholarly portal NARCIS. By 2019, NARCIS provided access to 360,000 open access publications from all Dutch universities, KNAW, NWO and a number of scientific institutes.

In 2011, a group of universities in North America formed the Coalition of Open Access Policy Institutions (COAPI). Starting with 21 institutions where the faculty had either established an open access policy or were in the process of implementing one, COAPI now has nearly 50 members. These institutions&#x27; administrators, faculty and librarians, and staff support the international work of the Coalition&#x27;s awareness-raising and advocacy for open access.

In 2012, the Harvard Open Access Project released its guide to good practices for university open-access policies, focusing on rights-retention policies that allow universities to distribute faculty research without seeking permission from publishers. As of November 2023, Rights retention policies are being adopted by an increasing number of UK universities as well.

In 2013 a group of nine Australian universities formed the Australian Open Access Strategy Group (AOASG) to advocate, collaborate, raise awareness, and lead and build capacity in the open access space in Australia. In 2015, the group expanded to include all eight New Zealand universities and was renamed the Australasian Open Access Support Group. It was then renamed the Australasian Open Access Strategy Group, highlighting its emphasis on strategy. The awareness raising activities of the AOASG include presentations, workshops, blogs, and a webinar series on open access issues.

==== Libraries and librarians ====
As information professionals, librarians are often vocal and active advocates of open access. These librarians believe that open access promises to remove both the price and permission barriers that undermine library efforts to provide access to scholarship, as well as helping to address the serials crisis. Open access provides a complement to library access services such as interlibrary loan, supporting researchers&#x27; needs for immediate access to scholarship. Librarians and library associations also lead education and outreach initiatives to faculty, administrators, the library community, and the public about the benefits of open access.

Many library associations have either signed major open access declarations or created their own. For example, IFLA have produced a Statement on Open Access. The Association of Research Libraries has documented the need for increased access to scholarly information, and was a leading founder of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC). Librarians and library associations also develop and share informational resources on scholarly publishing and open access to research; the Scholarly Communications Toolkit developed by the Association of College and Research Libraries of the American Library Association is one example of this work.

At most universities, the library manages the institutional repository, which provides free access to scholarly work by the university&#x27;s faculty. The Canadian Association of Research Libraries has a program to develop institutional repositories at all Canadian university libraries. An increasing number of libraries provide publishing or hosting services for open access journals, with the Library Publishing Coalition as a membership organisation.

In 2013, open access activist Aaron Swartz was posthumously awarded the American Library Association&#x27;s James Madison Award for being an &quot;outspoken advocate for public participation in government and unrestricted access to peer-reviewed scholarly articles&quot;. In March 2013, the entire editorial board and the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Journal of Library Administration&quot; resigned en masse, citing a dispute with the journal&#x27;s publisher. One board member wrote of a &quot;crisis of conscience about publishing in a journal that was not open access&quot; after the death of Aaron Swartz.

==== Public ====
The public may benefit from open access to scholarly research for many reasons. Advocacy groups such as SPARC&#x27;s Alliance for Taxpayer Access in the US argue that most scientific research is paid for by taxpayers through government grants, who have a right to access the results of what they have funded. Examples of people who might wish to read scholarly literature include individuals with medical conditions and their family members, serious hobbyists or &quot;amateur&quot; scholars (e.g. amateur astronomers), and high school and junior college students. Additionally, professionals in many fields, such as those doing research in private companies, start-ups, and hospitals, may not have access to publications behind paywalls, and OA publications are the only type that they can access in practice.

Even those who do not read scholarly articles benefit indirectly from open access. For example, patients benefit when their doctor and other health care professionals have access to the latest research. Advocates argue that open access speeds research progress, productivity, and knowledge translation.

==== Low-income countries ====
In developing nations, open access archiving and publishing acquires a unique importance. Scientists, health care professionals, and institutions in developing nations often do not have the capital necessary to access scholarly literature.

Many open access projects involve international collaboration. For example, the SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online), is a comprehensive approach to full open access journal publishing, involving a number of Latin American countries. Bioline International, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping publishers in developing countries is a collaboration of people in the UK, Canada, and Brazil; the Bioline International Software is used around the world. Research Papers in Economics (RePEc), is a collaborative effort of over 100 volunteers in 45 countries. The Public Knowledge Project in Canada developed the open-source publishing software Open Journal Systems (OJS), which is now in use around the world, for example by the African Journals Online group, and one of the most active development groups is Portuguese. This international perspective has resulted in advocacy for the development of open-source appropriate technology and the necessary open access to relevant information for sustainable development.

== History ==



=== Extent ===
Various studies have investigated the extent of open access. A study published in 2010 showed that roughly 20% of the total number of peer-reviewed articles published in 2008 could be found openly accessible.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1371/journal.pone.0011273&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that by 2010, 7.9% of all academic journals with impact factors were gold open access journals and showed a broad distribution of Gold Open Access journals throughout academic disciplines. A study of random journals from the citations indexes AHSCI, SCI and SSCI in 2013 came to the result that 88% of the journals were closed access and 12% were open access. In August 2013, a study done for the European Commission reported that 50% of a random sample of all articles published in 2011 as indexed by Scopus were freely accessible online by the end of 2012. A 2017 study by the Max Planck Society put the share of gold access articles in pure open access journals at around 13 percent of total research papers.

In 2009, there were approximately 4,800 active open access journals, publishing around 190,000 articles. As of February 2019, over 12,500 open access journals are listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals.

A 2013-2018 report (GOA4) found that in 2018 over 700,000 articles were published in gold open access in the world, of which 42% was in journals with no author-paid fees. The figure varies significantly depending on region and kind of publisher: 75% if university-run, over 80% in Latin America, but less than 25% in Western Europe. However, Crawford&#x27;s study did not count open access articles published in &quot;hybrid&quot; journals (subscription journals that allow authors to make their individual articles open in return for payment of a fee). More comprehensive analyses of the scholarly literature suggest that this resulted in a significant underestimation of the prevalence of author-fee-funded OA publications in the literature. Crawford&#x27;s study also found that although a minority of open access &quot;journals&quot; impose charges on authors, a growing majority of open access &quot;articles&quot; are published under this arrangement, particularly in the science disciplines (thanks to the enormous output of open access &quot;mega journals&quot;, each of which may publish tens of thousands of articles in a year and are invariably funded by author-side charges—see Figure 10.1 in GOA4).

According to Scopus database in August, 2024, 46.2% of works, indexed therein and published in 2023, had some form of open access. More than half of the OA publications (27.5% of all indexed works in 2023) were in fully Gold Open Access sources, 16.7% of all were in Green OA sources (i.e. which allow for self-archiving by authors), 9.2 % in Hybrid Gold OA sources (such as journals, which have open access and behind-paywall articles in the same issue), and 10.6 % were in Bronze OA sources (free-to-read on the publishers&#x27; websites).
The adoption of Open Access publishing varies significantly from publisher to publisher, as shown in Fig. OA-Plot, where only the oldest (traditional) publishers are shown, but not the newer publishers, that use the Open Access model exclusively. This plot shows, that since 2010 the Institute of Physics has the largest percentage of OA publications, while the American Chemical Society has the lowest. Both the IOP and the ACS are non-profit publishers. The increase in OA percentage for articles published before ca. 1923 is related to the expiration of a 100-year copyright term. Some publishers (e.g. IOP and ACS made many such articles available as Open Access, while others (Elsevier in particular) did not.

The Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR) indexes the creation, location and growth of open access open access-repositories and their contents. As of February 2019, over 4,500 institutional and cross-institutional repositories have been registered in ROAR.

== Effects on scholarly publishing ==

=== Article impact ===

Since published articles report on research that is typically funded by government or university grants, the more the article is used, cited, applied and built upon, the better for research as well as for the researcher&#x27;s career.

Some professional organizations have encouraged use of open access: in 2001, the International Mathematical Union communicated to its members that &quot;Open access to the mathematical literature is an important goal&quot; and encouraged them to &quot;[make] available electronically as much of our own work as feasible&quot; to &quot;[enlarge] the reservoir of freely available primary mathematical material, particularly helping scientists working without adequate library access&quot;.

==== Readership ====
OA articles are generally viewed online and downloaded more often than paywalled articles and that readership continues for longer. Readership is especially higher in demographics that typically lack access to subscription journals (in addition to the general population, this includes many medical practitioners, patient groups, policymakers, non-profit sector workers, industry researchers, and independent researchers). OA articles are more read on publication management programs such as Mendeley. Open access practices can reduce publication delays, an obstacle which led some research fields such as high-energy physics to adopt widespread preprint access.

==== Citation rate ====


A main reason authors make their articles openly accessible is to maximize their citation impact. Open access articles are typically cited more often than equivalent articles requiring subscriptions. This &#x27;citation advantage&#x27; was first reported in 2001. Although two major studies dispute this claim, the consensus of multiple studies support the effect, with measured OA citation advantage varying in magnitude between 1.3-fold to 6-fold depending on discipline.

Citation advantage is most pronounced in OA articles in hybrid journals (compared to the non-OA articles in those same journals), and with articles deposited in green OA repositories. Notably, green OA articles show similar benefits to citation counts as gold OA articles. Articles in gold OA journals are typically cited at a similar frequency to paywalled articles. Citation advantage increases the longer an article has been published.

==== Altmetrics ====
In addition to format academic citation, other forms of research impact (altmetrics) may be affected by OA publishing, constituting a significant &quot;amplifier&quot; effect for science published on such platforms. Initial studies suggest that OA articles are more referenced in blogs, on Twitter, and on English Wikipedia. The OA advantage in altmetrics may be smaller than the advantage in academic citations, although findings are mixed.

=== Journal impact factor ===
Journal impact factor (JIF) measures the average number of citations of articles in a journal over a two-year window. It is commonly used as a proxy for journal quality, expected research impact for articles submitted to that journal, and of researcher success. In subscription journals, impact factor correlates with overall citation count, however this correlation is not observed in gold OA journals.

Open access initiatives like Plan S typically call on a broader adoption and implementation of the Leiden Manifesto and the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) alongside fundamental changes in the scholarly communication system.

=== Peer review processes ===

Peer review of research articles prior to publishing has been common since the 18th century. Commonly reviewer comments are only revealed to the authors and reviewer identities kept anonymous. The rise of OA publishing has also given rise to experimentation in technologies and processes for peer review. Increasing transparency of peer review and quality control includes posting results to preprint servers, preregistration of studies, open publishing of peer reviews, open publishing of full datasets and analysis code, and other open science practices. It is proposed that increased transparency of academic quality control processes makes audit of the academic record easier. Additionally, the rise of OA megajournals has made it viable for their peer review to focus solely on methodology and results interpretation whilst ignoring novelty. Major criticisms of the influence of OA on peer review have included that if OA journals have incentives to publish as many articles as possible then peer review standards may fall (as aspect of predatory publishing), increased use of preprints may populate the academic corpus with un-reviewed junk and propaganda, and that reviewers may self-censor if their identity is open. Some advocates propose that readers will have increased skepticism of preprint studies - a traditional hallmark of scientific inquiry.

=== Predatory publishing ===

Predatory publishers present themselves as academic journals but use lax or no peer review processes coupled with aggressive advertising in order to generate revenue from article processing charges from authors. The definitions of &#x27;predatory&#x27;, &#x27;deceptive&#x27;, or &#x27;questionable&#x27; publishers/journals are often vague, opaque, and confusing, and can also include fully legitimate journals, such as those indexed by PubMed Central. In this sense, Grudniewicz et al. proposed a consensus definition that needs to be shared: &quot;Predatory journals and publishers are entities that prioritize self-interest at the expense of scholarship and are characterized by false or misleading information, deviation from best editorial and publication practices, a lack of transparency, and/or the use of aggressive and indiscriminate solicitation practices.&quot;

In this way, predatory journals exploit the OA model by deceptively removing the main value added by the journal (peer review) and parasitize the OA movement, occasionally hijacking or impersonating other journals. The rise of such journals since 2010 has damaged the reputation of the OA publishing model as a whole, especially via sting operations where fake papers have been successfully published in such journals. Although commonly associated with OA publishing models, subscription journals are also at risk of similar lax quality control standards and poor editorial policies. OA publishers therefore aim to ensure quality via auditing by registries such as DOAJ, OASPA and SciELO and comply to a standardised set of conditions. A blacklist of predatory publishers is also maintained by Cabell&#x27;s blacklist (a successor to Beall&#x27;s List). Increased transparency of the peer review and publication process has been proposed as a way to combat predatory journal practices.

=== Open irony ===

Open irony refers to the situation where a scholarly journal article advocates open access but the article itself is only accessible by paying a fee to the journal publisher to read the article. This has been noted in many fields, with more than 20 examples appearing since around 2010, including in widely-read journals such as &quot;The Lancet&quot;, &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;Nature&quot;. In 2012 Duncan Hull proposed the Open Access Irony award to publicly humiliate journals that publish these kinds of papers. Examples of these have been shared and discussed on social media using the hashtag #openirony. Typically, these discussions are humorous exposures of articles/editorials that are pro-open access, but locked behind paywalls. The main concern that motivates these discussions is that restricted access to public scientific knowledge is slowing scientific progress. The practice has been justified as important for raising awareness of open access.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Databases and repositories ===
Multiple databases exist for open access articles, journals and datasets. These databases overlap, however each has different inclusion criteria, which typically include extensive vetting for journal publication practices, editorial boards and ethics statements. The main databases of open access articles and journals are DOAJ and PMC. In the case of DOAJ, only fully gold open access journals are included, whereas PMC also hosts articles from hybrid journals.

There are also a number of preprint servers which host articles that have not yet been reviewed as open access copies. These articles are subsequently submitted for peer review by both open access and subscription journals, however the preprint always remains openly accessible. A list of preprint servers is maintained at ResearchPreprints.

For articles that are published in closed access journals, some authors will deposit a postprint copy in an open-access repository, where it can be accessed for free. Most subscription journals place restrictions on which version of the work may be shared and/or require an embargo period following the original date of publication. What is deposited can therefore vary, either a preprint or the peer-reviewed postprint, either the author&#x27;s refereed and revised final draft or the publisher&#x27;s version of record, either immediately deposited or after several years. Repositories may be specific to an institution, a discipline (e.g.arXiv), a scholarly society (e.g. MLA&#x27;s CORE Repository), or a funder (e.g. PMC). Although the practice was first formally proposed in 1994, self-archiving was already being practiced by some computer scientists in local FTP archives in the 1980s (later harvested by CiteSeer). The SHERPA/RoMEO site maintains a list of the different publisher copyright and self-archiving policies and the ROAR database hosts an index of the repositories themselves.

==== Representativeness in proprietary databases ====
Uneven coverage of journals in the major commercial citation index databases (such as Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed) has strong effects on evaluating both researchers and institutions (e.g. the UK Research Excellence Framework or Times Higher Education ranking). While these databases primarily select based on process and content quality, there has been concern that their commercial nature may skew their assessment criteria and representation of journals outside of Europe and North America. At the time of that study in 2018, there were no comprehensive, open source or non-commercial academic databases. However, in more recent years, The Lens emerged as a suitable outside-paywalls universal academic database.

=== Distribution ===
Like the self-archived green open access articles, most gold open access journal articles are distributed via the World Wide Web, due to low distribution costs, increasing reach, speed, and increasing importance for scholarly communication. Open source software is sometimes used for open-access repositories, open access journal websites, and other aspects of open access provision and open access publishing.

Access to online content requires Internet access, and this distributional consideration presents physical and sometimes financial barriers to access.

There are various open access aggregators that list open access journals or articles. ROAD (the Directory of Open Access Scholarly Resources) synthesizes information about open access journals and is a subset of the ISSN register. SHERPA/RoMEO lists international publishers that allow the published version of articles to be deposited in institutional repositories. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) contains over 12,500 peer-reviewed open access journals for searching and browsing.

Open access articles can be found with a web search, using any general search engine or those specialized for the scholarly and scientific literature, such as Google Scholar, OAIster, base-search.net, and CORE Many open-access repositories offer a programmable interface to query their content. Some of them use a generic protocol, such as OAI-PMH (e.g., base-search.net). In addition, some repositories propose a specific API, such as the arXiv API, the Dissemin API, the Unpaywall/oadoi API, or the base-search API.

In 1998, several universities founded the Public Knowledge Project to foster open access, and developed the open-source journal publishing system Open Journal Systems, among other scholarly software projects. As of 2010, it was being used by approximately 5,000 journals worldwide.

Several initiatives provide an alternative to the English language dominance of existing publication indexing systems, including Index Copernicus (Polish), SciELO (Portuguese, Spanish) and Redalyc (Spanish).

== Policies and mandates ==

Many universities, research institutions and research funders have adopted mandates requiring their researchers to make their research publications open access. For example, Research Councils UK spent nearly £60m on supporting their open access mandate between 2013 and 2016. New mandates are often announced during the Open Access Week, that takes place each year during the last full week of October.

The idea of mandating self-archiving was raised at least as early as 1998. Since 2003 efforts have been focused on open access mandating by the funders of research: governments, research funding agencies, and universities. Some publishers and publisher associations have lobbied against introducing mandates.

In 2002, the University of Southampton&#x27;s School of Electronics &amp; Computer Science became one of the first schools to implement a meaningful mandatory open access policy, in which authors had to contribute copies of their articles to the school&#x27;s repository. More institutions followed suit in the following years. In 2007, Ukraine became the first country to create a national policy on open access, followed by Spain in 2009. Argentina, Brazil, and Poland are currently in the process of developing open access policies. Making master&#x27;s and doctoral theses open access is an increasingly popular mandate by many educational institutions.

In the US, the NIH Public Access Policy has required since 2008 that papers describing research funded by the National Institutes of Health must be available to the public free through PubMed Central (PMC) within 12 months of publication. In 2022, US President Joe Biden&#x27;s Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a memorandum calling for the removal of the 12-month embargo. By the end of 2025, US federal agencies must require all results (papers, documents and data) produced as a result of US government-funded research to be available to the public immediately upon publication.

In 2023, the Council of the European Union recommended the implementation of an open-access and not-for-profit model for research publishing by the European Commission and member states. These recommendations are not legally binding and received mixed reactions. While welcomed by some members of the academic community, publishers argued that the suggested model is unrealistic due to the lack of crucial funding details. Furthermore, the council&#x27;s recommendations raised concerns within the publishing industry regarding the potential implications, and they also emphasized the importance of research integrity and the need for member states to address predatory journals and paper mills.

In 2024, the Gates Foundation announced a &quot;preprint-centric&quot; open access policy, and their intention to stop paying APCs. In 2024, the government of Japan also announced a Green open access policy, requiring that government-funded research be made freely available on institutional preprint repositories from April 2025.

=== Compliance ===
As of March 2021, open-access mandates have been registered by over 100 research funders and 800 universities worldwide, compiled in the Registry of Open Access Repository Mandates and Policies. As these sorts of mandates increase in prevalence, collaborating researchers may be affected by several at once. Tools such as SWORD can help authors manage sharing between repositories.

Compliance rates with &quot;voluntary&quot; open access policies remain low (as low as 5%). However it has been demonstrated that more successful outcomes are achieved by policies that are compulsory and more specific, such as specifying maximum permissible embargo times. Compliance with compulsory open-access mandates varies between funders from 27% to 91% (averaging 67%). From March 2021, Google Scholar started tracking and indicating compliance with funders&#x27; open-access mandates, although it only checks whether items are free-to-read, rather than openly licensed.

== Inequality and open access ==
=== Gender inequality ===
Gender inequality favoring men can be found in many disciplines, including political science, economics and neurology, and critical care research. For instance, in critical care research, 30.8% of the 18,483 research articles published between 2008 and 2018 were led by female authors and were more likely to be published in lower-impact journals than those led by male authors. Open access publishing may improve the visibility of female researchers both inside and outside academia, but without deliberate support of female researchers, open access publishing may exacerbate gender inequality.

=== High-income–low-income country inequality ===
A 2022 study has found &quot;most OA articles were written by authors in high-income countries, and there were no articles in Mirror journals by authors in low-income countries.&quot; &quot;One of the great ironies of open access is that you grant authors around the world the ability to finally read the scientific literature that was completely closed off to them, but it ends up excluding them from publishing in the same journals&quot; says Emilio Bruna, a scholar at the University of Florida in Gainesville.

LXX, no. 20 (21 December 2023), pp. 73–74. Reviewer Darnton writes: &quot;Baldwin warns: journal publishers are gouging their customers, scholarly monographs reach a tiny audience, libraries are floundering under budget pressures, academics are pursuing careers rather than truth, and readers are not getting all the information they deserve.&quot; (p. 74.) Writes Darnton: &quot;Most scientific research is subsidized by the federal government.&quot; Under a 2022 White House directive, &quot;As of December 31, 2025, all agencies... must require immediate open access... The G7 leaders took a similar stand on May 14, 2023, as did the European Council on May 23. The tide is turning in favor of unrestricted access, but the countervailing forces are so complex that the future remains cloudy.&quot; (p. 73.)

<text>Air California, later renamed AirCal, was a U.S. airline company headquartered in Newport Beach, California that started in the 1960s as a California intrastate airline. The airline&#x27;s home airport was Orange County Airport, now known as John Wayne Airport.

Air California was the &quot;other&quot; California intrastate carrier, counterpart to better known Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA). The two airlines had very different origins. PSA was the product of a highly competitive, lightly-regulated earlier period in California intrastate airline history, while Air California was born into a later, far more regulated California environment. The California regulator explicitly aimed to ensure Air California&#x27;s success by shielding it from PSA competition, in particular at Orange County Airport, from which PSA was excluded. Air California was further protected by Orange County itself. From 1967 through 1980, Orange County ensured Air California was one of only two mainline airlines to have access to (and the dominant carrier at) Orange County Airport, a lucrative duopoly that allowed Air California to prosper.

Air California/AirCal had a series of unusual owners. From 1970 to 1974, it was under the control of C. Arnholt Smith, a San Diego powerbroker, later convicted of fraud. From 1974 to 1981, it was controlled by Smith&#x27;s former holding company Westgate-California Corporation (WCC), while WCC was in an extended period of bankruptcy run by a court-appointed trustee. From 1981 to 1987, AirCal was controlled by two California real estate developers, who, despite the turbulent nature of the industry at the time, made a success of the airline, before selling it to American Airlines.

Following the federal Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, Air California expanded beyond its namesake state. The airline was renamed AirCal in 1981 and merged into American Airlines in 1987. By that time, AirCal flew as far east as Chicago and as far north as Seattle, Anchorage, and Vancouver, BC. But less than four years later, American gutted the former AirCal network, leaving little to show for its purchase.

==History==

===Startup===
Air California originated in a December 1965 meeting in Corona del Mar by William Myers, Alan H. Kenison (later a founder of Jet America Airlines), Mark T. Gates, Jr., William L. Pereira, Jr. (son of noted architect William Pereira who designed the Theme Building at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)) and Lud Renick to discuss air service from Orange County to San Francisco, with the idea of Air California as the result. At the time, air service from Orange County Airport was minimal. The population of Orange County in 1967 was about 1.2mm, up from only 216,000 in 1950; Orange County was the fastest growing in the country. Air travel in California was then dominated by Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA). Air California was designed to do what PSA would not: serve Orange County. Airport officials had asked all major west coast carriers to serve Orange County Airport and none were interested.

At the time, all significant US airlines but one were tightly regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), an agency of the Federal government. PSA was the exception, its intrastate status made it exempt from CAB oversight. It had used that freedom to grow from nothing in 1949 to a jet carrier in 1965, taking market share away on its California routes from much larger but less efficient carriers regulated by the CAB. Air California was designed to be like PSA but centered on Orange County. Air California was incorporated on 12 April 1966 and the same month, applied to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to be a California intrastate airline for its first route, from Orange County Airport to San Francisco Airport at a fare of $14.85. The CPUC approved the application in September, requiring a minimum of five frequencies per day. In December, Air California had an initial public offering and the airline launched its first services January 16, 1967, using two Lockheed Electra aircraft. Total capital raised prior to the first flight was $5.3mm, including $2.5mm from the stock offering.

In October 1967, Air California took delivery of two more Electras, for a total of four. San Jose and Oakland were added. In 1968, the airline added two DC-9s to the fleet, but by year end both the DC-9s and the Electras had been phased out in favor of six 737-200s. Ontario and Burbank were added.

===First failed PSA merger and sale===
As the nearby table shows, Air California&#x27;s initial financial results were poor. In December 1969 it agreed to a merger with PSA, citing its financial results. Air California shareholders approved the deal, but shortly thereafter, in May 1970, PSA withdrew from the deal, citing a &quot;negative view&quot; by the CPUC. Within a week, Air California&#x27;s CEO had resigned, and a new buyer surfaced, Westgate-California Corporation (WCC). In June 1970, WCC acquired 60% of the carrier, which was approved by the CPUC on the grounds that Air California&#x27;s future was in doubt. In July 1971, WCC pumped $2.5mm into Air California, buying shares that increased its stake to 81%.

In April 1971, Air California provided flight attendant training to Southwest Airlines during its startup phase.


WCC ownership was a mixed blessing. WCC&#x27;s owner was C. Arnholt Smith, a powerful San Diego businessman and banker, owner of the San Diego Padres baseball team, a close associate and funder of President Richard Nixon and owner of the United States National Bank of San Diego (USNB), largest bank in that city and the 10th largest in California. Smith was highly controversial, accused of lining the pockets of his family and friends through self-dealing (including with WCC, USNB and others) of making illegal campaign contributions, and more. WCC made a loss, its first in 11 years, in 1971.

There was one immediate benefit from WCC ownership: Air California was able to take its seventh 737, delivered to WCC and turned over to Air California in September 1970. The eighth was delivered in May 1971. First-class (&quot;Fiesta&quot;) service and Palm Springs made their debut in 1969, San Diego in 1970, though Burbank was suspended. In 1971, Sacramento was added to the network. 

===Second failed PSA merger, parent company bankruptcy and scandal===

In mid 1972, WCC agreed to sell Air California to PSA. WCC told the CPUC that Air California showed no signs of making money and WCC would not further support it. In February 1973 the CPUC agreed, against heavy opposition, including from its own legal staff, to allow the merger to proceed. But by then the merger also faced opposition from the US Department of Justice on anti-trust grounds. For instance, the combination would have had an 81% market share on the Los Angeles Basin to San Francisco Bay market and even higher market shares on individual submarkets. These market shares show how successful were the California intrastate carriers in driving off the far larger CAB-regulated carriers pre-deregulation.

But then, in May 1973, The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued to place WCC in receivership on the grounds of serious malfeasance by Smith, plus the outside auditors withdrew their certification of Air California&#x27;s accounts for 1971 and 1972, and those of WCC for 1971. Trading was halted in Air California and WCC stocks. Unsurprisingly, almost exactly a year after it had been made, the PSA offer for Air California lapsed. In October, USNB was seized by the FDIC, knocking out the foundation of Smith&#x27;s empire. In February 1974, WCC filed for Chapter X bankruptcy. Chapter X bankruptcy was eliminated in a 1978 bankruptcy reform, but under it, WCC operated under the control of trustees, who managed it in the interests of shareholders. The bankruptcy dragged on for eight years, with WCC selling pieces of itself along the way, until it was finally liquidated in 1982. Therefore, from 1974 until it was sold in 1981, Air California was in the odd situation of being owned by a bankrupt company run by trustees rather than conventional management.

===Survival: the role of the California regulator===

Prior to 1979 US airline deregulation, as a California intrastate carrier, Air California was economically regulated by the CPUC, in contrast to most US airlines of the era, which were economically regulated by CAB. Prior to 1965, the CPUC only had the right to regulate intrastate ticket prices. So long as they followed CPUC tariffs, anyone was free to start an intrastate California airline, to enter and leave specific markets and to choose their own frequencies. But in 1965, the CPUC gained the right to regulate airline certification, market entry/exit and service quality for California intrastate airlines. In effect, the CPUC became a kind of mini-CAB for California intrastate airlines.

Air California was unprofitable for the first five years (though it broke even on an operating basis in 1970; see table) and CPUC regulation was critical to its survival. In 1969 the CPUC said &quot;From the beginning we have recognized the need to protect Air California from destructive competition, at least until it becomes a viable operator.&quot; This took four forms: (i) CPUC ensured that other than some minor routes, Air California did not compete with PSA, leaving the carriers with largely non-overlapping route networks. This left Air California free to concentrate its energies on competing with CAB carriers on its routes, which had higher costs. (ii) The CPUC approved higher airfares for Air California than for PSA was authorized on similar routes. (iii) The CPUC stopped the further new entry of intrastate airlines. (iv) in at least one case, the CPUC restrained PSA growth with the explicit goal of helping Air California. In fact, from 1965 onward, the CPUC certified only one other carrier, Holiday Airlines, which for some reason chose to fly only to Lake Tahoe.

===Orange County Airport duopoly and financial stability===
Since its parent company was mired in bankruptcy, it was timely that Air California&#x27;s fortunes took a turn for the better, becoming solidly profitable from 1973 onward. In this, Air California was helped not only by the CPUC, but also by its duopoly at Orange County Airport. From 1967 until late 1980, the only two carriers at Orange County were Air California and Bonanza Air Lines (and Bonanza&#x27;s successors, Air West in 1968 and Hughes Airwest in 1970). This was driven by lack of facilities. It&#x27;s hard to overstate how important this was: in the mid-1970s, Air California relied on Orange County Airport for up to 75% of its passengers. In 1979, the FAA determined that this was, unsurprisingly, discriminatory, leading to the airport opening to other airlines.

In February 1975, Holiday Airlines collapsed, with Air California and PSA both getting emergency CPUC authorization to back fill for Holiday at Lake Tahoe Airport, which the CPUC required be flown with Electras. Air California acquired three.

===Intrastate no more, sale to new owners and AirCal===
In 1977, still in Chapter X bankruptcy, WCC bought out Air California&#x27;s minority shareholders and made it a wholly owned subsidiary, in furtherance of its intent to reorganize with Air California as its main business. In 1977-78 Air California added two 737-100 aircraft from Aloha. But Air California ended the 1978 flying to Reno, Nevada; it was no longer an intrastate airline. With out-of-state expansion spurring it on, Air California ended 1979 with 11 737s and had 16 at the end of 1980, but by then the Electras were gone.

In October 1980, Air Florida announced it had purchased interests in the to-be-reorganized WCC from two WCC creditors. This kicked off a bidding war for post-reorganization WCC, which Air Florida ultimately won in November for $47mm. WCC at the time owned only Air California, plus a Puerto Rican tuna cannery, but Air Florida would have to wait until WCC completed its reorganization and in the meantime, the WCC trustee was still in charge, with a mandate to get the best deal for WCC investors. The losing bidder in the WCC auction thus bid for Air California at a price that would give a better return for WCC investors. And when the dust settled on that auction in May 1981, the new group won, with a bid of $61.5mm, $57.5mm of which was financed by Wells Fargo. This was AirCal Investments, a vehicle for two Orange County real estate developers, William Lyon and George Argyros. WCC&#x27;s trustee didn&#x27;t bother to hide his satisfaction with the outcome. He preferred local ownership. He had been angered by the surprise bid by Air Florida to buy WCC, had in fact put Argyros and Lyon together in the first place, when each had separately inquired.

The airline that Lyon and Argyros bought came, as of April 6, 1981, with a new name (AirCal) and a new image. Landor Associates did the new livery, Mary McFadden did the new uniforms.

===Stripped of John Wayne Airport advantage; financial distress===

After unbroken profitability while WCC was in Chapter X, AirCal under Lyon &amp; Argyros was immediately unprofitable. Headwinds included the debt the two had taken on to buy AirCal, the early 1980s recession, the extended impact of the August air traffic controller’s strike, which limited airline aircraft utilization and growth and the expanding impact of 1979 airline deregulation, which spread competitors into AirCal markets, and vice versa. For instance, PSA finally broke into John Wayne Airport (SNA), after, as they noted, 15 years of trying. AirCal had entered LAX in 1980., its LAX penetration assisted by a late 1980 strike at PSA. AirCal was no longer protected by the CPUC or the SNA duopoly. Further, jet fuel prices increased from 40 cents/gal at the beginning of 1979 to over a dollar in 1981, related to the 1979 oil crisis.

There was another factor: AirCal was squeezed at its SNA base, its historic source of profits. From 1970 to 1985, SNA capped daily average jet departures to 41/day, with AirCal having 27 during the duopoly period that ended 1980. But the FAA insisted other airlines be accommodated. As other airlines entered, incumbent frequencies were cut to accommodate them. AirCal was the biggest incumbent, so was the biggest victim; AirCal’s average daily SNA frequencies dropped over the course of several years from 27 to 12.5. Many airlines wanted a piece of SNA and were even willing to buy MD-80s (then the quietest narrowbody available) to do so. For instance, Frontier’s decision to get MD-80s was SNA-driven.

AirCal came close to failure, but was saved by a combination of cost savings, with substantial layoffs, a 10% wage reduction for those who remained, a realignment of its route network, concentrating on increasing frequency on important routes like LAX to San Francisco. Lyon took over the CEO position himself. During this period, the historic Hughes Airwest network was being eliminated, as Hughes successor Republic withdrew from the west coast. Western Airlines intrastate service was also shrinking. AirCal was also substantially recapitalized, with the combination of an initial public offering with Lyon &amp; Argyros converting debt they’d loaned the airline into equity. This relieved the airline of a substantial debt load.

===Final years===

AirCal’s fleet remained 737-200s (and two 737-100s), along with seven MD-80s, until it ordered a dozen Boeing 737-300s in 1984, with Boeing agreeing to take back the MD-80s in trade. The 737-300s were even quieter than the MD-80s, and obviously compatible with the 737-100/200s. The last of the MD-80s were gone by early 1986. SNA noise limits basically forced AirCal into buying BAe-146s; new 1985 flight limits had a looser limit for aircraft below a certain noise level, and the BAe-146 qualified. That would have given PSA a substantial advantage unless AirCal also got the aircraft, so it ordered six.

In the fourth quarter of 1985 the string of profits was upset due to the entry of Continental West into California. Continental West was a short-lived Texas Air subsidiary created to take delivery of aircraft due to limits placed on Continental by its bankruptcy judge. Additional capacity cratered west coast fares once again, leading to 1986 being once again unprofitable. In June 1986, AirCal created a holding company for the airline, ACI Holdings.

In November 1986, AirCal accepted a purchase offer from American Airlines for $225mm, $90mm of which would be split by Lyon &amp; Argyros. American was in the midst of a hub expansion program, then building new (now defunct) hubs in Raleigh, Nashville and San Juan. Building a west coast presence from scratch at the same time was considered a bridge too far for American, so it bought rather than built. Another factor was that Frank Lorenzo&#x27;s Texas Air was also interested and American was eager to block it. AirCal had achieved a 1985 market share on the LA Basin to SF Bay corridor market of just under 33%, second to PSA which had just less than 49%. AirCal had expanded up the coast to Canada and Alaska and as far east as Chicago with a fleet of 39 aircraft. American’s purchase closed May 1, 1987 and AirCal was merged out of existence on July 1. AirCal&#x27;s long-time rival, PSA, was likewise swallowed by USAir.

In April 1967, Air California was operating 48 nonstop Lockheed L-188 Electra propjet flights a week from Orange County (SNA) to San Francisco (SFO). It added Orange County (SNA) to San Jose (SJC) and Oakland (OAK) flights around the beginning of 1968.

By May 1968, the airline was operating 92 flights per week from SNA to SFO, primarily using Douglas DC-9-10 twin jets, as well as 50 flights a week from SNA to SJC, with most continuing on to OAK.

By 1976, Air California was operating nonstop intrastate jet service between Orange County and San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego and Palm Springs; between San Diego and Oakland and San Jose; between Ontario and Oakland and San Jose; and between Palm Springs and San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland.

==Legacy==

AirCal left almost no trace.

The successors of PSA and AirCal, USAir and American, raised prices, reflecting their higher costs. In early 1990, the last-minute roundtrip fare from Los Angeles to Sacramento was $456, over $1000 in 2024 dollars. State legislators were increasingly irate, finally proposing a raft of bills to punish the carriers, even suggesting a state-owned airline. They didn&#x27;t notice that the market had already taken care of the problem. United Airlines had already announced an increase in frequency on Los Angeles to San Francisco from 16 to 27 per day. More to the point, Southwest Airlines had announced it was entering Burbank with 10 a day service to Oakland at a last-minute fare of $59 one way, $29 in advance.

The resulting Los Angeles Basin to San Francisco Bay fare war was brutal, made worse when Iraq invaded Kuwait thereby spiking oil prices, collapsing demand for international travel and tipping the US into the Gulf War. In January 1991, in announcements only two weeks apart, American and then US Air gutted the former AirCal and PSA systems, throwing in the towel less than five years after offering to buy the former intrastate airlines.

Despite this, in the case of PSA its indirect legacy is substantial because it was the inspiration for Southwest Airlines, and thus PSA is generally viewed as the original low-cost carrier. Air California/AirCal can&#x27;t make the same claim. In fact, there&#x27;s a good case to be made that Air California only survived to be sold to Lyon &amp; Argyros &quot;because&quot; of regulation. Air California was a product of the post-1965 CPUC and the Orange County duopoly, and thus not a good argument for deregulation.

That makes AirCal&#x27;s success under Lyon and Argyros even more anomalous. The chance that two Orange County real estate barons, airline industry outsiders, could buy an apparently healthy airline, have it immediately fall on hard times, but quickly turn it around and make a success of it during one of the most turbulent eras in US airline history would seem rather slim. But that&#x27;s what happened. And then they had the good sense to sell the airline at a healthy profit (since it appears that the vast majority of their purchase money was funded by a loan from Wells Fargo) and apparently never again dabble in airlines. They might have had the single greatest return on investment of any airline owners in the 1980s, and yet this part of US airline history is little known.

In 2015, American Airlines added to its heritage livery series a AirCal Boeing 737-800.

==Incidents and accidents==
On Tuesday, February 17, 1981, an AirCal Boeing 737-200 crashed while attempting to land at John Wayne Airport. AirCal Flight 336 was a scheduled flight from San Jose International Airport to John Wayne International Airport. Around 48 minutes into the flight, the crew received clearance for a visual approach to land on runway 19R. As Flight 336 was approaching, another AirCal flight, Flight 931, received clearance to take off from runway 19R.

The controller recognized the potential danger of a collision between the two aircraft and ordered Flight 931 to abort takeoff and instructed Flight 336 to go around. Flight 931 aborted its takeoff, however, Flight 336 did not go around and instead landed on the runway with the landing gear retracted. The aircraft left the runway surface around past the runway threshold, skidded another before finally coming to rest to the right of the centerline. All passengers and crew members survived the crash. The Boeing 737-293 aircraft, registered N468AC, was damaged beyond repair and consequently written off.

On June 5, 1986, an AirCal 737 flying from Los Angeles to Portland came within 100 feet of a private plane before the AirCal pilot banked to avoid a collision. No crew or passengers were injured during the incident.

<doc id="381229" wikidata="Q1124755" url="?curid=381229" title="Shepherd's beaked whale">
<text>Shepherd&#x27;s beaked whale (Tasmacetus shepherdi), also commonly called Tasman&#x27;s beaked whale or simply the Tasman whale, is a cetacean of the family Ziphiidae and the only species in the genus Tasmacetus. The whale has not been studied extensively. Only four confirmed at sea sightings have been made and 42 strandings recorded (as of 2006). It was first known to science in 1937, being named by W. R. B. Oliver after George Shepherd, curator of the Wanganui Museum, who collected the type specimen near Ohawe on the south Taranaki coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, in 1933.

==Description==

Adults can reach lengths of to and weigh about 2.32 to 3.48 tons. At birth they may be about long. 

They are robust and large-bodied for beaked whales, having a bluff melon and a long, dolphin-like beak. 

It is the only species of ziphiid with a full set of functional teeth (17 to 27 pairs in both the upper and lower jaws). Adult males also have a pair of tusks at the tip of the lower jaw. 

They are dark brown dorsally and cream-colored ventrally, with a pale band extending up from the flipper and another pale area extending as a swathe on the posterior flank. The tall, falcate dorsal fin is set about two-thirds the way along the back.

==Population and distribution==
Sightings and stranding records indicate that the species has a circumpolar distribution in southern hemisphere. No population estimates exist for Shepherd&#x27;s beaked whale. As of 2006, there have been about 42 stranding records of the species from New Zealand (including the Chatham Islands, 24), Argentina (7), Tristan da Cunha (6), Australia (3), and the Juan Fernández Islands (2). The northernmost record was at Shark Bay in Western Australia in 2008. There have been five unconfirmed sightings (mostly from New Zealand), as well as a &quot;probable&quot; sighting near Shag Rocks and four confirmed sightings—the first two confirmed sightings occurred in 1985, within a few minutes of each other, off the Tristan da Cunha group (first sighting at ); the third in 2002 near Gough Island (); and the fourth in 2004 south of Tasmania (). In January 2012, a group of up to a dozen of this species were photographed and filmed by the Australian Antarctic Division south of Portland, Victoria. 

Multiple sightings of the species have been reported from Otago submarine canyons off Otago coast, New Zealand. Sightings have been recorded throughout the year with vocalization recordings, suggesting regular presences there. These include at least two sightings in 2016 which were the first confirmed sightings within New Zealand waters, followed by four sightings in 2017, one or more sighting(s) in 2018, one sighting in 2019, four or five sightings in 2021, five sightings in 2022 including a pod of 15-20 animals.

There have been additional sightings from other parts of New Zealand, such as off Gisborne, several sightings off Kaikōura, off Fiordland, Taranaki, and so on.

==Behaviour==
Four of the confirmed sightings of this species involved three to six individuals (one group included a calf) in waters from to deep, while a 2012 sighting involved as many as ten to twelve individuals. The animals surfaced several times, before arching to dive. Some were observed to come to the surface at a steep angle like many other ziphiids, raising their head and beaks out of the water. The Shepherd&#x27;s beaked whale&#x27;s blow could be observed with the naked eye at a distance of up to 1,000 metres, within a bushy plume that is relatively tall for a ziphiid varying from 1 to 2 metres in height 

The species is seldom seen because of its deep, offshore distribution in waters where sighting conditions can be difficult (the &quot;Roaring Forties&quot; and &quot;Furious Fifties&quot;).

Research done on a stranded individual&#x27;s stomach has indicated that Shepherd&#x27;s beaked whales eat both fish and squid, as opposed to most beaked whales which only eat cephalopods.

==Conservation==
There are no reports of this species being hunted or killed accidentally by humans. Shepherd&#x27;s beaked whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).

==Taxonomy==
Recent molecular evidence suggests that this species diverged after the most basal extant ziphiid genus, &quot;Berardius&quot;, and prior to &quot;Ziphius&quot;

==Popular culture==
The species was featured on a 45p commemorative stamp issued by Tristan da Cunha in 2019 as part of a set celebrating different species of whale.

<doc id="381230" wikidata="Q122299" url="?curid=381230" title="Farringdon, London">
<text>Farringdon is an area in the London Borough of Islington, situated immediately north of its border with the City of London. The term is used to describe the area around Farringdon station.

Historically the district corresponded to southern Clerkenwell and the small parish of St Sepulchre Middlesex. The area&#x27;s name is a back-formation: It takes its name from the station, which was in turn named after Farringdon Street. 

To the south lie the City of London wards of Farringdon Within and Farringdon Without. The City Wards, which were once a single unit, are unconnected to the distinct area of Farringdon to their north, though there is an etymological connection.

==History==
===Toponymy===

There are numerous places in England called Farringdon; all meaning &quot;fern covered hill&quot;. William and Nicholas &quot;de Faringdon&quot;, whose name is likely to have originated from one of these places, were two related prominent citizens and Aldermen in the early 13th century. Nicholas purchased the area of the Farringdon ward of the City of London in 1279 and became its Alderman in 1281. In 1394 the ward was split into the still extant Farringdon Within and Farringdon Without.

Farringdon Street was built by covering part of the River Fleet in the Farringdon Without Ward of the city. The street was named after either the Ward or after the Nicholas de Faringdon. Farringdon Road was an extension of Farringdon Street, also built over the River Fleet, but lying northward, beyond the city.

Farringdon Station was built close to Farringdon Road, and originally named &quot;Farringdon Street Station&quot;. The presence of the railway station has led to the surrounding areas of southern Clerkenwell being referred to as &quot;Farringdon&quot;.

===Administration===
Farringdon station and its environs historically corresponded to southern Clerkenwell and three much smaller areas; the parish of St Sepulchre Middlesex, Charterhouse and Glasshouse Yard.

When the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury was formed in 1900, Clerkenwell and the other areas were absorbed into the new borough. In 1965 the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury became part of the new London Borough of Islington.

===Street name etymologies===
* Albion Place – thought to be simply a suitably patriotic name; formerly George Court
* Aldersgate Street – the name &quot;Aldersgate&quot; is first recorded around 1000 in the form &quot;Ealdredesgate&quot;, i.e. &quot;gate associated with a man named Ealdrād&quot;. The gate, constructed by the Romans in the 2nd or 3rd centuries when London Wall was constructed, probably acquired its name in the late Saxon period.
* Benjamin Street – unknown; thought to probably be for a local landowner/builder
* Briset Street – after Jordan de Briset, local 12th-century landowner who gave land to the Order of St John for their headquarters here
* Britton Street – after Thomas Britton, local coal seller and prominent patron of the arts, who lived nearby in the 17th – 18th century; it was formerly known as Red Lion Street, after a local inn
* Broad Yard
* Carthusian Street – after the Carthusian monks who lived near here in the Middle Ages
*Charterhouse Buildings, Charterhouse Mews, Charterhouse Square and Charterhouse Street – Anglicisation of Chartreuse, from Grande Chartreuse, head monastery of the Carthusians in France; a nearby abbey was founded by monks of this order in 1371
* Cowcross Street – this street was path for cattle being taken to nearby Smithfield market
* Dickens Mews – presumably after Victorian author Charles Dickens
* Eagle Court – after Eagle, Lincolnshire; the Order of Knights of St John owned land in this village and the Bailiff of Eagle owned a house near here
* Farringdon Road – from Sir William or Nicholas de Farnedon/Faringdon, local sheriffs or aldermen in the 13th century
* Faulkners Alley
* Fox and Knot Street – after the Fox and Knot tavern of the 18th century
* Francis Court
* Glasshouse Yard – after a 17th-century glass factory on this site
* Goswell Road – There is dispute over the origins of the name, with some sources claiming the road was named after a nearby garden called &#x27;Goswelle&#x27; or &#x27;Goderell&#x27; which belonged to Robert de Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk, and others a well called the Gode Well whilst others state it derives from &quot;God&#x27;s Well&quot;, and the traditional pagan practice of well-worship.
* Greenhill&#x27;s Rents – after John Greenhill, local 18th-century property owner
* Hat and Mitre Court – after an 18th-century tavern of this name
* Passing Alley – altered from the descriptive Pissing Alley, renamed at some point prior to the 1790s

* Turnmill Street – originally 13th-century ‘Trimullstrete’ or ‘Three Mills Street’, after three mills that stood near here by the river Fleet
* White Horse Alley

==Geography==
The station and its immediate environs are located in the southern extremity of the London Borough of Islington, adjacent to the northern boundary of the City of London and the eastern boundary of the London Borough of Camden.

===Boundaries===
Farringdon has no formally defined boundaries, but can be approximated as extending to Clerkenwell Road to the north, Goswell Road and Aldersgate Street to the east, Charterhouse Street, Charterhouse Square and Carthusian Street to the south and Farringdon Road to the west. Central District Alliance BID is the Business Improvement District representing Farringdon.

===Boundary with the City===
A map based on Stow &quot;c&quot; 1600 shows the Fagswell Brook south of Cowcross Street as the northern boundary of the city. At Long Lane, by the brook, were the now lost ornamental boundary markers known as West Smithfield Bars, first documented in 1170 and 1197.

Until 1993, a small triangle of land south of Cowcross Street was within the City of London and formed part of the Farringdon Without ward. The boundary between the City of London and the London Borough of Islington was locally realigned in 1993 with small exchanges of land between each; in this area the boundary was moved slightly south to align with Charterhouse Street.

==Transport==
The redevelopment and expansion of Farringdon station has had a significant effect on the local area. The station is served by the Thameslink north–south rail route and since May 2022 the east–west Elizabeth line service which required the construction of additional station entrances. The Crossrail project to construct the Elizabeth line was delayed by a number of years, having been due to open in December 2018. A proposed upgrade of the Thameslink route would also affect the local area, including the construction of further station entrances, the pedestrianisation of Cowcross Street and the demolition of several buildings.

<text>A barbican (from ) is a fortified outpost or fortified gateway, such as at an outer defense perimeter of a city or castle, or any tower situated over a gate or bridge which was used for defensive purposes.

==Europe==

In the Middle Ages, barbicans were typically situated outside, or at the edge of, the main line of defenses, and were connected to the city walls with a walled road called &quot;the neck&quot;. They would thus defend the entrance to the city or castle at the &quot;choke point&quot;. In the 15th century, with the improvement in siege tactics and artillery, barbicans lost their significance. Barbicans were built well into the 16th century. Fortified or mock-fortified gatehouses remained a feature of ambitious French and English residences well into the 17th century. Portuguese medieval fortification nomenclature uses barbican (&quot;barbacã&quot;) to describe any wall outside of and lower than the main defensive wall that forms a second barrier. The barrier may be complete, extensive or only protect particularly weak areas. The more restrictive term &quot;gate barbican&quot; is used for structures protecting gates.

==Arab world==
The origin of the English word barbican is thought to be found in either Persian or Arabic (see or here).

Paul Deschamps (1888–1974) interpreted the Arabic word &#x27;bashura[h]&#x27; as used in 13th-century chronicles to mean barbican, a defensive structure placed ahead of a gate but this has been debunked, &#x27;bashura&#x27; denoting rather an entire section of the outer fortifications, which may include a barbican but also a bastion, gate, tower or all of these.

==South Asia==
Barbicans were also used in South Asian fortifications where some of their purposes were to protect the main gate from being rammed by war elephants.

==East Asia==
Fortifications in East Asia also feature similar high structures. In particular, gates in Chinese city walls were often defended by an additional &quot;archery tower&quot; in front of the main gatehouse, with the two towers connected by walls extending out from the main fortification. Literally called &quot;jar walls&quot;, they are often referred to as &quot;barbicans&quot; in English.

<doc id="381240" wikidata="Q2911428" url="?curid=381240" title="Tower Hill Memorial">
<text>The Tower Hill Memorial is a pair of Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials in Trinity Square Gardens, on Tower Hill in London, England. The memorials, one for the First World War and one for the Second, commemorate civilian, merchant seafarers and fishermen who were killed as a result of enemy action and have no known grave. The first, the Mercantile Marine War Memorial, was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and unveiled in 1928; the second, the Merchant Seamen&#x27;s Memorial, was designed by Sir Edward Maufe and unveiled in 1955. A third memorial, commemorating merchant seamen who were killed in the 1982 Falklands War, was added to the site in 2005.

The first memorial was commissioned in light of the heavy losses sustained by merchant shipping in the First World War—more than 17,000 people died and some 3,300 British and Empire-registered commercial vessels sunk as a result of enemy action. The Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) commissioned Lutyens, who initially designed a massive arch on the banks of the River Thames, but this was rejected by the authorities, to Lutyens&#x27; disdain. A compromise was struck, as a result of which the memorial was constructed in Trinity Square Gardens on Tower Hill, a site further from the river but with a long maritime history. The site was Crown land, meaning a special Act of Parliament was required to allow the construction. Queen Mary unveiled the memorial on 12 December 1928 at a ceremony broadcast live on the radio, her first use of the medium. The memorial is a vaulted corridor reminiscent of a Doric temple and similar to Lutyens&#x27; structures in cemeteries on the Western Front. The walls are clad with bronze panels which bear the names of the missing.

Merchant shipping losses in the Second World War were significantly higher than in the first (4,786 ships, 32,000 lives) and the IWGC commissioned a second memorial on the same site, intended to complement the first. Maufe designed a sunken garden, accessed by steps behind the original memorial, the walls of which were again clad with bronze panels with the names of the missing. At regular intervals between the panels are relief sculptures (by Charles Wheeler) representing the seven seas. Wheeler also sculpted two sentries, a Merchant Navy sailor and officer, which stand at the top of the steps. The new memorial was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II in November 1955, after which relatives of those named on it were invited to lay flowers.

The memorials to the world wars are both listed buildings—the Mercantile Marine Memorial is gradeI and part of a national collection of Lutyens&#x27; war memorials, and Maufe&#x27;s Merchant Seamen&#x27;s Memorial is listed at gradeII*. The Falklands War memorial is not listed.

==First World War memorial==
===Background===

In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain and other countries affected. In particular, the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) assumed responsibility for commemorating all casualties from the British Empire. The commission was established in 1917, and one of its first principal architects was Sir Edwin Lutyens, an English architect who made his reputation building country houses and later designed much of New Delhi. Lutyens acted as an unpaid advisor to the IWGC during the war, in which capacity he made several visits to France to make initial plans for organised cemeteries. The war had a profound effect on Lutyens; following it, he devoted much of his time to memorialising its casualties. He designed The Cenotaph on Whitehall in central London (which became Britain&#x27;s national memorial to the two world wars) and many other cemeteries and memorials for the IWGC, including the Thiepval Memorial (completed 1932).

The IWGC and its founder, Fabian Ware, were determined from the outset that all casualties should be individually and equally commemorated, regardless of military rank or social status. Where it was not possible to provide a headstone (for example because a body could not be recovered), a casualty&#x27;s name was included on one of the commission&#x27;s large memorials, such as Tower Hill. The Admiralty did not initially believe that the IWGC&#x27;s remit extended to sailors lost at sea and planned its own commemorations, but after negotiation, it was agreed that the commission would take responsibility for commemorating maritime casualties as it did with those who died on land. The commission&#x27;s charter defined its scope as &quot;members of the military and naval forces of the Crown&quot;; in 1921 the commissioners resolved that this extended to the Mercantile Marine and other civilian organisations who were engaged in the war effort.

Merchant shipping and fishing fleets played a vital role in supporting the British war effort throughout the First World War, both by resupplying the Royal Navy at sea and by delivering food, products, and raw materials to the United Kingdom. Merchant ships were regularly sunk by the German Navy from the outset of the war, particularly after Germany commenced unrestricted submarine warfare. By the end of the war, more than 3,300 British- and empire-registered merchant ships had been sunk, with the loss of more than 17,000 lives.

===History===

The IWGC sought advice on the form of the memorial from the seafarers&#x27; unions, who consistently requested a memorial in the form of a home for aged seamen or similar, but the commission was set against functional memorials in the belief that they became associated more with their function than with commemoration. It rejected the request, overruling its own advisory committee in doing so, on the grounds that its charter did not allow it to fund the ongoing costs of an institution. It insisted that merchant seamen would be commemorated on a monument.

The commission first intended to site the memorial at Temple Steps, on the bank of the River Thames, for which it commissioned Lutyens. The architect designed a massive arch. The proposed structure would have consisted of two stone piers of linked, alternating arches (reminiscent of the Thiepval Memorial, which he was designing for the IWGC at around the same time) joined by a large beam, itself supported by two Doric columns between the arches. This was approved by London County Council, but the Office of Works rejected it on the advice of the Royal Fine Arts Commission (RFAC), which objected on two grounds: first, that Lutyens&#x27; proposal would involve the demolition of an arch built when the Thames Embankment was constructed; and second, that the memorial would be better suited to a site further downstream, east of Tower Bridge, where it would be seen by ocean-going vessels which could not travel west of the bridge. Both Lutyens and Ware attempted to persuade the RFAC to reconsider but to no avail. Lutyens was furious, feeling the merchant seamen had been relegated to &quot;some hole in the corner because they happened to be low in social status&quot; and that Sir Reginald Blomfield (a member of the RFAC and a rival of Lutyens) was acting out of spite.

Lutyens described the RFAC&#x27;s opinion as &quot;bosh&quot;, and suggested to Ware that they should continue regardless and force a confrontation. Ware was more diplomatic, and the IWGC chose a new site in Trinity Square Gardens on Tower Hill, still west of Tower Bridge but further from the river. This site was considered appropriate because it was within sight of the Thames, albeit not on the riverbank, and the area already had maritime connections, including the headquarters of the Port of London Authority at 10 Trinity Square, Trinity House, and the church of All Hallows-by-the-Tower (itself home to many nautically themed memorials). Philip Longworth, in a history of the IWGC, remarked that the location meant the commission&#x27;s only memorial in London &quot;would never be seen by most Londoners, still less find a place in the national consciousness as did Lutyens&#x27; stark monument on Whitehall&quot;. (The Cenotaph was not commissioned by the IWGC.) 
Trinity Square Gardens was Crown land administered by trustees. Although the trustees suggested they would not object to the memorial, they did not have the power to give full consent and a special act of Parliament was required. The bill was laid before Parliament in December 1926 and received royal assent in June 1927, becoming the (17 &amp; 18 Geo. 5. c.xxvi). The building work was undertaken by Holloway Brothers (London) and the memorial was unveiled by Queen Mary (deputising for her husband, King George V) on 12 December 1928, her first solo engagement of the sort. The unveiling ceremony was broadcast live on the radio in the queen&#x27;s first use of the medium. Despite taking place in torrential rain, the unveiling ceremony was attended by a large crowd, who cheered the queen as she was driven away.

===Design===


The main structure is in Portland stone. It takes the form of a vaulted colonnade or pavilion reminiscent of a Doric temple but open at both ends. After the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester, it is Lutyens&#x27; second-largest war memorial in the United Kingdom, and is the only British First World War memorial dedicated exclusively to merchant seamen. It is raised on a platform slightly above street level, oriented east to west and accessed from the street by a set of five stone steps at each end. The structure is long by wide and up to tall. It consists of three bays on either side, created by eight alternating square piers and six pairs of round columns. The eight piers are clad in rectangular bronze panels to give the impression of rustication. The panels (divided into 24 numbered sections) contain the names of missing mariners, ordered by ship name and then alphabetically following the name of the captain or master. The vessels of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets are listed separately. Above the bays is a Doric entablature. The low, pitched roof has shallow parapets on either side and gabled ends; on top, in the centre, is a large square attic which supports a large stone drum. The attic is similar to Lutyens&#x27; original design for the York City War Memorial, which featured a Stone of Remembrance rather than a drum. The sculptural element is the work of William Reid Dick, who worked on several other war memorials, including the Menin Gate in Ypres, Belgium.

The memorial&#x27;s main dedication is in bronze letters to the front (south) of the attic: ; above it are the dates of the First World War (1914–1918), which are also carved into the stone on north side. To either side are decorative bronze wreaths. On the inside, the floor is in black and white stone in a chequerboard pattern. On the north side, bronze spikes occupy the otherwise-open bays.

The largest single loss of life commemorated on the memorial is from the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; on 7 May 1915. Of the 1,200 dead, more than 350 British crew members are commemorated on the Mercantile Marine memorial. In total, the First World War memorial records the names of some 12,000 casualties.

In his biography of Lutyens, Michael Barker described the design as &quot;dignified classicism&quot;; another Lutyens biographer, Christopher Hussey, described it as a &quot;classical shrine&quot;. Tim Skelton, author of &quot;Lutyens and the Great War&quot;, notes the similarity of the colonnade to the shelter buildings in Lutyens&#x27; cemeteries in France and Belgium and suggests that the memorial would be &quot;equally well at home on the Western Front as in the heart of London&quot;. The resemblance to the cemetery buildings is also noted by the Dutch architect Jeroen Geurst, who compares it in particular to those at Hooge Crater in Belgium and Serre Road in France. In the opinion of the historian David Crane, the memorial never recovered from its &quot;miserable start&quot; and is consequently the least well-known of the IWGC&#x27;s major works following the First World War.

==Second World War memorial==

===Background===

From the outbreak of the Second World War, shipping losses were again high and a similar convoy system was used in an effort to protect merchant vessels. By the war&#x27;s end, 4,786 ships had been sunk, with the loss of some 32,000 lives (of which almost 24,000 are commemorated at Tower Hill); almost a quarter of the losses were in British waters. Although military casualties were lower in the Second World War than in the First, civilian casualties were higher and there was widespread destruction of British cities. By the end of the second war there was little appetite for another wave of large memorials. Instead, many memorials from the first war were adapted or expanded to commemorate the new casualties—an approach the IWGC took at Tower Hill and elsewhere. Generally, it only built new memorials to the missing in places which had not been touched by the First World War. The IWGC was by this time a much more established and well-respected institution and thus found it easier to obtain the agreements and public support necessary for its work.

The architect was Edward Maufe, who began his career designing churches and by the 1950s was the IWGC&#x27;s principal architect for the United Kingdom for the Second World War commemorations. Maufe was also responsible for the Air Forces Memorial in Surrey and extensions to the Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Chatham naval memorials.

===History===

Following the Second World War, the IWGC considered various sites for a memorial to the new casualties but, after consultation with the relevant public bodies, decided Tower Hill was the most appropriate location. The commission briefed Maufe that the new memorial should complement Lutyens&#x27; design and fit in with the existing architecture in the area, including the Port of London Authority building. Maufe first proposed extending Lutyens&#x27; structure with a further colonnade, but this was rejected. His next design, for a sunken garden, was accepted. Another act of Parliament was required, which was passed in July 1952 as the (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 6 &amp; 1 Eliz. 2. c. xv). Work began later in 1952 and was completed in 1955. Some modifications to Maufe&#x27;s design were necessary. Maufe initially planned a larger grassy area between Lutyens&#x27; colonnade and the sunken garden with a Stone of Remembrance at the centre. The stone was eliminated and the grass scaled back to reduce the overall size of the memorial and assuage the concerns of local people. The depth of the garden had to be reduced at the south end because of a London Underground tunnel.

The memorial commemorates merchant seamen from ships registered in Britain or its Empire or on loan to the governments of those countries, and who were lost at sea as a result of enemy action in the Second World War; it lists 23,765 men, of whom 832 were fishermen and 80 maritime pilots and lighthousemen. The much larger casualty figures and corresponding scale of the memorial reflect the vital contribution of the Merchant Navy to the British war effort in the Second World War. The memorial was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II at a modest ceremony on 5 November 1955, two days before Remembrance Sunday. The ceremony, described by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as &quot;all as modest and anonymous as the Merchant Navy itself&quot;, concluded with the sounding of the &quot;Last Post&quot; by buglers from the Royal Marines, answered by a single ship&#x27;s horn on the River Thames. After the unveiling, 16,000 relatives of those commemorated on the memorial laid flowers around it, a process which lasted until late in the evening.

===Design===

The Second World War memorial takes the form of a semi-circular sunken garden located behind the First World War Memorial, to its north in Trinity Square Gardens. The idea of a sunken garden appears to have originated from discussions immediately following the end of the war. There was a feeling among the new generation of artists and architects that the elaborate and artistic memorials to the First World War did not capture the national mood of mourning for the new wave of casualties and that spaces such as gardens, which provided a location for individual mourning and reflection, were more suitable. According to the architectural historian Philip Ward-Jackson, Maufe&#x27;s memorial gives the impression of being a wing of an imaginary ruined church, complete with provided seats—an image which would have had &quot;powerful resonance in the bombed City&quot; (much of the surrounding area, including the Port of London Authority building, was severely damaged by German bombing). The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described Maufe&#x27;s extension as &quot;less assertive&quot; than the original memorial; he praised the idea of a memorial to the missing in the form of a void (the sunken garden), but felt it was let down by Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;strangely jaunty&quot; reliefs between the lists of names. 

The ground-level entrance area to the Second World War memorial is on the southern side of the sunken garden and consists of two pylons flanking a low wall that faces the First World War memorial. Built into the low wall is a stone similar to Lutyens&#x27; Stone of Remembrance, which is inscribed with the years of the war (1939–1945) and carries the memorial&#x27;s dedication: . Each of the flanking pylons supports an over-life-sized statue, representing a Merchant Navy sailor (on the east side) and officer (on the west). The entrance steps either side of the pylons descend to the sunken garden which contains the name panels. The walls of the garden are high in Portland stone, to match the original memorial, with the names of the missing from the Second World War listed on 132 bronze panels fixed to the walls. The name panels circle the entire sunken garden, lining both the northern and the southern walls, and the eastern and western walls. Spaced at regular intervals along the semi-circular (northern) part of the memorial are seven allegorical sculptures representing the Seven Seas. These are the work of Charles Wheeler, who also executed the sculptures for Maufe&#x27;s extensions of the Royal Navy memorials. The garden is mainly grass, with a sculpture of a compass in a &#x27;pool&#x27; of bronze, set to magnetic north, in the centre. The Red Ensign (the flag flown by British-registered civilian vessels) flies over the site.

==Later history==

The Tower Hill memorial commemorates 36,087 seafarers from both world wars. Only merchant seamen who have no known grave are listed at Tower Hill. Those whose bodies were recovered or who served with other organisations (such as the Indian Merchant Navy) are commemorated elsewhere—for example, 1,200 merchant seamen who served with the Royal Navy during the Second World War are commemorated on the Liverpool Naval Memorial. The memorial register for the Mercantile Marine Memorial was originally published by the IWGC in nine volumes in 1928. After the Second World War, a three-volume &quot;Roll of Honour of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets 1939–1945&quot; was produced in 1958 by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation and distributed to a range of organisations in the UK and abroad. The first two volumes of this roll of honour contain the names listed on the Merchant Seamen&#x27;s Memorial at Tower Hill. The registers for the Tower Hill memorials are held at the nearby Trinity House on the north side of Trinity Square Gardens.

Since 2000, 3 September has been celebrated annually as Merchant Navy Day; a memorial service is held close to that date at the Tower Hill Memorial. In 2005, the Merchant Navy Association unveiled another memorial on the site. The work of Gordon Newton, it is dedicated to the Merchant Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary casualties of the 1982 Falklands War. It consists of a bronze sundial, raised on a granite base; at the dial&#x27;s centre is a large bronze anchor. Around the base are bronze plaques, one of which contains the inscription. The others record the names of the 17 dead, ordered by ship. The Falklands memorial, which is not listed, was unveiled on 4 September 2005 by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Alan West and is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (the IWGC having changed its name in 1960).

Liverpool marked the 70th anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic, the longest continuous military campaign in World War II, by having twenty-five warships sail through the port to mark the milestone. Ceremonies were also held at the Tower Hill Memorial on 11 May 2013, along with other events elsewhere in London and Britain.

Lutyens&#x27; First World War Memorial became a gradeII* listed building in 1973. Listed status offers legal protection from demolition or modification; gradeII* is reserved for &quot;particularly important buildings of more than special interest&quot; and is applied to about 5.5% of listings. It was upgraded to gradeI status (which is applied to around 2.5% of listed buildings, those of &quot;the greatest historic interest&quot;) in November 2015 when Lutyens&#x27; war memorials were declared a national collection. Maufe&#x27;s Merchant Seamen&#x27;s Memorial has separately been a gradeII* listed building since 1998. The CWGC began a major restoration project of the colonnade in 2019.

<text>Stefan Konrad Raab (born 20 October 1966) is a German entertainer, television host, television producer, and businessman. From 1999 to 2015, he hosted the late-night comedy talk show &quot;TV total&quot; on ProSieben. He also created a number of other television shows on the channel, such as &quot;Schlag den Raab&quot; and &quot;Bundesvision Song Contest&quot;.

Raab began his TV career hosting the comedy show &quot;Vivasion&quot; in 1993. He became well known in 1994 after composing a hit single spoofing national football coach Berti Vogts. In the early 2010s, Raab was considered the &quot;most powerful man in German entertainment television&quot;.

Raab is also known for his recurring role as either producer, writer and/or performer of the German entries to the Eurovision Song Contest from 1998 to 2012. He was the initiator of the national pre-selection show Unser Star für Oslo (&quot;Our Star for Oslo&quot;), in which Germany&#x27;s winning entry at the 2010 contest in Oslo was determined.

In 2015, Raab ended his on-screen career while staying active as a television producer. He made his public return in 2024.

==Early life and family==
Raab grew up in Cologne with his sister and their parents, who owned a butcher&#x27;s shop. He attended Jesuit boarding school Aloisiuskolleg in Bonn. Before entering the entertainment business, he completed an apprenticeship as a butcher in his parents&#x27; shop and studied law before dropping out of university after five semesters.

Raab lives in a suburb of Cologne and has two daughters (born 2004 and 2006) with his girlfriend Nike. Other than this, very little is known about Raab, who deliberately hides his private life from the media.

==Career==
=== Television ===

Raab became popular in Germany as the host of the comedy show &quot;Vivasion&quot; for German music television channel VIVA from 1993 to 1998.

In 1999, he created &quot;TV total&quot; which began airing in April 2001 on ProSieben, four times a week. While &quot;TV total&quot; started as a comedy format mainly showing and satirizing funny and embarrassing sequences from other television programs, it soon came to be more of a late night show featuring musical performances—in some ways similar to &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; or &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

After a boxing match against Regina Halmich in 2001 and a speed skating race against Claudia Pechstein in 2002, he also created several other celebrity sports events that are produced regularly, including &quot;TV total Turmspringen&quot; (high diving) and &quot;TV total Stock Car Crash Challenge&quot; (stock car racing). He also brought fun and variety to the show by invented new sports: In November 2003, he initiated the first &quot;official&quot; World Wok racing Championship in Winterberg, Germany. Modified Chinese woks are used to make timed runs down an Olympic bobsled track. The championship took place annually until March 2011, in Innsbruck. The first &quot;Autoball EM&quot; — Autoball being a version of football played in cars and using an exercise ball to score goals — took place in 2007.

In 2006, Raab invented the game show &quot;Schlag den Raab&quot; (German for &quot;Beat the Raab&quot;, remade for British television as &quot;Beat the Star&quot; and as &quot;Beat Your Host&quot; in several other European countries), in which he competed against a contestant in various disciplines. Some episodes of the show lasted more than five hours with excellent ratings.

Raab also organized &quot;PokerStars.de Nacht&quot;, a poker event featuring some celebrity names in German entertainment.

In September 2012, he announced that he would be hosting a new talk show on ProSieben which would include political guests. It began airing on 11 November 2012. It stood in direct competition with the self-titled talk show hosted by Günther Jauch.

In September 2013, Raab was one of four hosts (one from each big television network) at the federal election debate between chancellor Angela Merkel and her challenger Peer Steinbrück.

In mid-2015, Raab announced his retirement from television and stated that he would remain hosting until the end of the year. The last episode of his show &quot;TV total&quot; aired on 16 December and the last episode of &quot;Schlag den Raab&quot; aired on 19 December 2015.

He made his return in 2024 with a new show titled &quot;Du gewinnst hier nicht die Million&quot; on RTL+, which has been described as a combination of &quot;TV total&quot; and &quot;Schlag den Raab&quot;.

===Music===

As a musician, Raab is an autodidact, playing various instruments, such as piano, drums, guitar, ukulele, and some wind instruments. He began working as a freelance producer and composer of jingles and radio commercials in 1990 at his own studio in Cologne. 

From 1994 onwards, he produced a number of popular songs, including &quot;Böörti Böörti Vogts&quot; (a song about Berti Vogts), &quot;Hier kommt die Maus&quot; (&quot;Here comes the mouse&quot;, a tribute to the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Die Sendung mit der Maus&quot;), &quot;Maschen-Draht-Zaun&quot;, &quot;Wir kiffen&quot;, &quot;Gebt das Hanf frei!&quot; (&quot;Legalise Dope!&quot;, featuring Shaggy and samples from German politician Hans-Christian Ströbele), &quot;Hol&#x27; mir ma&#x27; &#x27;ne Flasche Bier&quot; (&quot;Get me a bottle o&#x27; beer&quot;, containing samples from then-chancellor Gerhard Schröder), and &quot;Space Taxi&quot; from the soundtrack of the film &quot;Traumschiff Surprise – Periode 1&quot;.

Based on the concept of the Eurovision Song Contest, Raab created and hosted the Bundesvision Song Contest (&quot;Bundes&quot;republik Deutschland = Federal Republic of Germany), which first aired on ProSieben in 2005. The contest features representatives from each of the 16 states of Germany and stipulates that their song has to be at least partly in German. It took place yearly until Raab&#x27;s preliminary retirement in 2015.

=== Involvement in the Eurovision Song Contest ===
Raab wrote the song for the German entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 1998, Guildo Horn&#x27;s &quot;Guildo hat euch lieb!&quot;. After placing first in the pre-selection competition Countdown Grand Prix 1998, it finished the main contest in seventh place. Raab participated himself as the German entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 with the nonsense song &quot;Wadde hadde dudde da?&quot;. He placed first in the pre-selection competition Countdown Grand Prix Eurovision 2000 and finished the contest in fifth place. For the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest, Raab created and hosted a talent show called &quot;SSDSGPS&quot; (&quot;Stefan sucht den Super-Grand-Prix-Star&quot;, &quot;Stefan seeks the super Grand-Prix star&quot;, satirising the title of the German Idol series &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot;, DSDS). The competition was won by Max Mutzke, who finished the main contest in eighth place.

In 2009, Raab was approached by the public broadcaster NDR, a member of the ARD broadcasting consortium, to jointly organise a national pre-selection in order to determine the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. It was revealed that Raab initially refused the request, but that his television network ProSieben accepted the offer to work with ARD/NDR. As a result of the cooperation, the talent show contest &quot;Unser Star für Oslo&quot; (&quot;Our Star for Oslo&quot;) took place from 2 February 2010 onwards, stretching across 8 shows. Raab took a lead role in the programmes as head of the jury. In the national final on 12 March 2010, Lena Meyer-Landrut emerged as winner. On 29 May 2010, Meyer-Landrut won the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 with the song &quot;Satellite&quot;, claiming the first German Eurovision victory in 28 years.

The cooperation between NDR and ProSieben was continued for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012. Meyer-Landrut was confirmed as the artist of the German entry after her successful win in the previous contest. The pre-selection competition &quot;Unser Song für Deutschland&quot; was held to determine the song of the German entry, with Meyer-Landrut performing twelve songs to be voted on by the public. Raab was involved in the selection of the competing entries, some of which he also wrote and composed, and was a juror on the final of the competition. &quot;Taken by a Stranger&quot;, which was produced by Raab, emerged as the winning song. In May 2011, Raab acted as co-host of the main contest alongside Anke Engelke and Judith Rakers, with Meyer-Landrut finishing in tenth place.

The week following the 2011 final, Raab announced he would end his Eurovision involvement as a pre-selection host, chairman of the jury, composer and musical producer. However, he still returned in 2012 as creator and producer of the pre-selection competition &quot;Unser Star für Baku&quot;. Raab participated as a regular jury member and was succeeded as jury president by Thomas D. The competition was won by Roman Lob with &quot;Standing Still&quot;, which finished the main contest in eighth place. Raab was no longer involved from the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 onwards, as the cooperation between NDR and ProSieben was dissolved.

After Raab came out of his retirement as entertainer and television host in 2024, he reportedly offered to produce a pre-selection competition for the Eurovision Song Contest 2025 to be hosted jointly by public and private broadcasters. In October 2024, Raab was confirmed to return as creator, producer and jury member of the pre-selection competition &quot;Chefsache ESC 2025: Wer singt für Deutschland?&quot;. The television shows will air on Das Erste as well as private channel RTL, where Raab had signed an exclusive contract. During a press conference, Raab stated he would be open to produce or write a song in the competition, but said his decision would depend on the participating artists and their music genre.

For &quot;TV total&quot; he received the &quot;Deutscher Fernsehpreis&quot; in 1999 as well as the comedy award &quot;Rose d&#x27;or&quot; in 2001.

On 29 May 2005, Raab received the &quot;Deutsch-Türkischer Freundschaftspreis&quot; (German-Turkish Friendship Award) for his &quot;TV total&quot; specials from Istanbul in preparation for the Eurovision Song Contest 2004. He won the &quot;Bravo Otto&quot; in the category &quot;Comedystar&quot; from 2000 to 2003. In 2000 and 2005, Raab was awarded the &quot;ECHO&quot; (German music award) as &quot;Best National Producer&quot;. In 2005, he also received the ECHO award as &quot;media partner of the year&quot;).

On 29 September 2007, Raab received the &quot;Deutscher Fernsehpreis&quot; for &quot;Best Entertainment Show&quot; for the fifth episode of &quot;Schlag den Raab&quot;. On 6 February 2008, the show was awarded the &quot;Goldene Kamera&quot; (Golden Camera). Furthermore, Raab received the media award &quot;Bambi&quot; on 27 November 2008. In 2009, Raab won the &quot;Herbert Award 2009&quot; for &quot;Best Television Sports show&quot; for &quot;TV total Turmspringen&quot;.

Madame Tussauds in Berlin has displayed a wax figure of Raab since April 2009.

As the initiator and president of the jury of the show &quot;Unser Star für Oslo&quot;, Raab was awarded the &quot;Bavarian TV Award&quot; in 2010.

On 12 November 2011, Raab came second in synchronised diving, teaming with Elton in Munich, at the &quot;TV Total Turmspringen 2011&quot; event. This was his first ever podium along with Elton at this event.

==Controversies==
Raab has been the subject of lawsuits throughout his career, some of which have gained public attention. The two most referenced cases are:
*The case of then 16-year-old model Lisa Loch, who was ridiculed during some shows through Raab&#x27;s assertion that her name (&quot;Loch&quot; meaning &quot;hole&quot; in German) made her more likely to find a job as an actress in pornographic movies. Loch claimed she received anonymous obscene telephone calls, was mocked by classmates and in public and as a result suffered sleeplessness and was afraid to leave her home. A court in Hamm ordered Raab to pay €70,000 in compensation due to infringement of personal rights.
*In an episode broadcast on 6 September 2004, Raab showed a clip, originally destined for a news broadcast, of a 28-year-old Turkish mother Nil S. holding a Schultüte (a cardboard cone, typically full of sweets, traditionally given to children in Germany on their first school day). Raab&#x27;s comment, &quot;Unbelievable! The drug traffickers are disguising themselves better and better&quot; (&quot;eine Tüte&quot; also means &quot;a marijuana joint&quot; in German slang, hence the pun), resulted in repeated lawsuits, and after a Munich court ruled against Raab, Nil S. settled for €20,000 compensation accompanied by a written apology.

<doc id="381248" wikidata="Q1240488" url="?curid=381248" title="Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury">
<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury was a metropolitan borough within the County of London from 1900 to 1965, when it was amalgamated with the Metropolitan Borough of Islington to form the London Borough of Islington.

It was the second smallest of the 28 boroughs within the County of London, stretching from Finsbury Pavement and Square northwest towards King&#x27;s Cross, splitting The Angel as well as including Farringdon station and the GPO complex at Mount Pleasant.

==Formation and boundaries==
The borough was formed from five civil parishes and extra-parochial places: Charterhouse, Liberty of Glasshouse Yard, St James &amp; St John Clerkenwell, St Luke Middlesex and St Sepulchre Middlesex. In 1915 these five were combined into a single civil parish called Finsbury, which was conterminous with the metropolitan borough.

Previous to the borough&#x27;s formation it had been administered by three separate local bodies: Holborn District Board of Works, Clerkenwell Vestry and St Luke&#x27;s Vestry. Charterhouse had not been under the control of any local authority prior to 1900.

The borough covered the areas of Finsbury, Moorfields, Clerkenwell, and St Luke&#x27;s. It bordered Islington, Shoreditch, the City of London, Holborn and St Pancras.

== Town Hall ==

The metropolitan borough was administered from Finsbury Town Hall on Rosebery Avenue. The building was built as the headquarters of Clerkenwell Vestry, and had been officially opened on 14 June 1895 by Lord Rosebery, the Prime Minister. The architect was C Evans Vaughan, and it was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as a &quot;nice irregular brick building with Tudor windows and lantern&quot;. Finsbury Town Hall is now home to the Urdang Academy, a successful performing arts college.

==Population and area==
Although metropolitan boroughs only dated from 1900, the London County Council compiled statistics in 1901 that show the population growth in London over the preceding century.

The area of the borough in 1901 was . The populations recorded in National Censuses were:

Constituent parishes 1801-1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900-1961

By comparison, after amalgamation with Islington, to form the modern London Borough of Islington, the combined area became 14.86 km2 - approximately ; in 2005, this had a population of 182,600, or a population density of 12,288/km2. In 1901 Finsbury, the population density was 42,276/km2.

== Coat of arms ==

When the borough was incorporated in 1900, the corporation adopted a complicated device bearing six shields for each of the constituent parishes and extra-parochial places from which it was formed.

At the top were shields depicting the old Cripplegate of the City of London and the arms of Charterhouse.

At the centre of the seal, on the left, is the shield of Clerkenwell Vestry. The parish church was dedicated to Ss. James and John, and the shield showed St. James on the left and the cross of St. John on the right.

To the right of this was the emblem of St Luke&#x27;s parish: as patron saint of artists, Luke was shown seated at an easel.

At the left base of the seal was a depiction of the gate of St. Botolph, representing the Liberty of Glasshouse Yard.

The design was completed by the shield of the parish vestry of St. Sepulchre. This parish was originally partly in the City of London, and partly in the county of Middlesex, and the shield combined the arms used bt the city and county.

In 1931 the borough received a grant of arms from the College of Arms. This also included references to Finsbury&#x27;s constituent parts, but in a more unified design.
The shield had the cross of St John, on which were placed a heraldic fountain for the New River and roundels and rings from the arms of Charterhouse School. At the top of the shield was a representation of the city wall and its gates.

The crest on top of the helm was for St Sepulchre&#x27;s parish, the shield held by the hand again combining elements of the arms of the City of London and Middlesex.

The supporters were a winged bull, emblem of St. Luke; and an heraldic dolphin, symbol of St. James. The dolphin supporter was &quot;charged&quot; with a well in reference to Clerkenwell.

The Latin motto chosen by the borough was &quot;Altiora Petimus&quot; or &quot;We seek higher things&quot;.
== Politics ==
The borough was divided into eleven wards for elections: City Road East, City Road West, East Finsbury, Old Street, Pentonville, St James&#x27;, St John&#x27;s, St Mark&#x27;s, St Phillip&#x27;s, St Sepulchre and West Finsbury.

===Borough council===
The first borough council was elected on 1 November 1900, when Conservative-supported Unionist and Moderate candidates took control. From 1903 to 1906 the Progressive Party held power. From 1906 to 1925 the Municipal Reform Party (allied to the Conservatives) controlled the borough. In 1925 a Ratepayer&#x27;s Association stood in place of the Municipal Reformers, replacing them as majority party. From 1928 to 1931, the Labour Party held control, with the Ratepayers holding power from 1931 to 1934. In 1934 Labour regained power, which it held until the abolition of the borough in 1965.

The number of councillors returned at each election to the council was as follows:

;Local elections

No Municipal Reform candidates were nominated after 1946, and Conservative candidates were nominated at local elections for the first time.
===Parliamentary constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough initially formed the two constituencies of Finsbury Central and Finsbury East. In 1918 a new constituency of Finsbury was formed which was identical with the metropolitan borough. By 1950 the population of the borough had declined to such an extent that the Finsbury constituency was merged with the neighbouring constituency of Shoreditch to become Shoreditch and Finsbury.

==Archival records==

Islington Local History Centre holds records of the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury, including council and committee minutes, rate books, publications and photographs. There are some street nameplates which retain the label &quot;Borough of Finsbury&quot;.

<doc id="381252" wikidata="Q2076187" url="?curid=381252" title="2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election">
<text>The 2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election was held on Wednesday, 26 November 2003, after being suspended for just over a year. It was the second election to take place since the devolved assembly was established in 1998. Each of Northern Ireland&#x27;s eighteen Westminster Parliamentary constituencies elected six members by single transferable vote, giving a total of 108 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). The election was contested by 18 parties and many independent candidates.

==Background==
The election was originally planned for May 2003, but was delayed by Paul Murphy, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

Several sitting MLAs stood under a different label to the one they had used in the 1998 election. Some had failed to be selected by their parties to stand and so stood as independents, whilst others had changed parties during the course of the assembly. Most of these realignments occurred within the unionist parties, with several defections between existing parties, and two new parties being formed – the United Unionist Coalition (formed by the three MLAs elected as independent unionists, though one later joined the DUP) and the Northern Ireland Unionist Party (formed by four of the five MLAs elected as the UK Unionist Party, though one later left them, joined the DUP for a period, then contested the election as an independent unionist).

The SDLP, which had been Northern Ireland&#x27;s dominant Irish nationalist party during the 1980s and 1990s, went into this election with concerns that they could lose numerous seats to fellow nationalists Sinn Féin, who had overtaken the SDLP in terms of votes and seats at the 2001 United Kingdom general election. Commentator, Brian Feeney, said: &quot;The SDLP has a series of baronial figures - John Hume, Seamus Mallon, Eddie McGrady - who hung on to power and didn&#x27;t groom their successors early enough. They just don&#x27;t have enough people on the ground in some areas of the province. Sinn Féin, by contrast, has deliberately cultivated collective leadership, bringing forward wave after wave of young, articulate, highly politicised heirs apparent, and their grassroots organisation is awesome.&quot;

==Results==
On the unionist side, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) became Northern Ireland&#x27;s biggest party for the first time in any election, overtaking the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). They gained ten seats, primarily at the expense of smaller unionist parties, to become the largest party both in seats and votes, winning thirty overall. The UUP increased their vote slightly, despite slipping to third place in first preference votes, and won 27 seats, a net loss of one. Shortly after the election three Ulster Unionist MLAs, Jeffrey Donaldson, Norah Beare and Arlene Foster, quit the party and later defected to the DUP.

On the nationalist side, Sinn Féin saw a big increase in their vote, gaining six seats at the net expense of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, for a total of 24 seats.

The minor parties all saw a significant fall in their support. The Alliance Party managed to hold all six of its seats despite their vote falling by a third, the Women&#x27;s Coalition, United Unionist Coalition and Northern Ireland Unionist Party were all wiped out, and the Progressive Unionist Party and UK Unionist Party won just one seat each. Neither the United Unionist Assembly Party nor the Northern Ireland Unionists won any seats.

The biggest surprise of the election came in West Tyrone with the election of the independent Kieran Deeny, a doctor campaigning on the single issue of hospital provision in Omagh.

=== Distribution of seats by constituency ===

<text>Gósol () is a village and municipality located in the northwest of the comarca of Berguedà in Catalonia, Spain. It is within the confines of Cadí-Moixeró Natural Park in the Pyrenees, to the west of Pedraforca.

Gósol is the only municipality in Berguedà which is in the province of Lleida rather than that of Barcelona. It is also a party to the Judicial district of La Seu d&#x27;Urgell.

==Geography==
The present town is centered in the eponymous valley of Gósol, which is enclosed by the Serra del Cadí and Pedraforca, in the Pyrenees. The ruins of the former town and castle, dating from the 11th century, overlook the Gósol from an adjacent hill.

==Villages within Gósol==
The municipal limits of Gósol includes, most notably, the village of Sorribes. Other settlements include Bonner, la Collada, Molí d&#x27;en Güell, Moripol, Castell de Termes, Font Terrers, and Torrent Senta.

==Climate==
Gósol has a cool subalpine climate. Compared to less mountainous areas of Catalonia it is rather wet. It receives over 900 mm (35.43 in.) of precipitation each year, concentrated in the spring months.

==Culture==
Gosol&#x27;s emblematic cultural institution is the Picasso Museum, which owes its existence to the visit of Pablo Picasso to the village from the spring of 1906 to mid-August of that same year. The artist installed himself at the only inn then in existence, Cal Tampanada. While in Gósol, Picasso underwent a transformation of palette, sketching style, and rhythm of composition. Picasso found his subjects in local livestock and people of Gósol, as well as Fernande Olivier, his partner.

===Notable dates===
*The town&#x27;s &quot;festa major&quot;, or town festival, takes place on August 15 each year. It is most notable for its unique folk dance, the &quot;&quot;Ball de les cosses&quot;.&quot;
*On New Year&#x27;s Eve (Saint Sylvester), legend says that witches hold gatherings on Pedraforca mountain.

===Local dishes===
*&quot;Pèsol negre&quot;, a local variety of &#x27;black pea&#x27;
*&quot;Blat de moro escairat&quot;, or &#x27;peeled corn&#x27;, often cooked in a pork broth
*&quot;Patates emmascarades&quot;, or &quot;Masked Potatoes&quot;, mashed potatoes cooked with blood or black pudding
*All i oli with pork, eaten during the swine-harvest in fall
*Veal with wild mushrooms
*Wild boar

<doc id="381259" wikidata="Q1405925" url="?curid=381259" title="Metropolitan Borough of Islington">
<text>Islington was a civil parish and metropolitan borough in London, England. It was an ancient parish within the county of Middlesex, and formed part of The Metropolis from 1855. The parish was transferred to the County of London in 1889 and became a metropolitan borough in 1900. It was amalgamated with the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury to form the London Borough of Islington in Greater London in 1965.

==Geography==
The borough comprised the districts of Pentonville (also partly in Clerkenwell/Finsbury), Islington (also partly in Clerkenwell/Finsbury), Barnsbury, Lower Holloway, Holloway, Tufnell Park (also partly in St Pancras), Archway, Highbury, and Canonbury.

The neighbouring boroughs were Finsbury, Hackney, Stoke Newington, Shoreditch, St Pancras.

==Governance==
The parish of St Mary Islington operated as an open vestry. It was added to the bills of mortality area in 1636. The vestry was incorporated by the Metropolis Management Act 1855 as an administrative vestry in the metropolitan area managed by Metropolitan Board of Works. On 21 March 1889 the MBW was abolished and the parish was transferred from the County of Middlesex to the newly formed County of London. Because of the reforms directed by the London Government Act 1899, on 1 November 1900 the vestry was abolished and replaced by the Islington Metropolitan Borough Council. The act allowed for the London County Council (1889-1965) and the metropolitan boroughs to transfer powers to and from each other, if both the county council and a majority of the boroughs agreed. Unlike municipal boroughs which received a grant of a charter of incorporation, the London metropolitan boroughs had no charters, being created by act of parliament.

The first election of councillors was set for 1 November 1900, with a third of the councillors going out of office each year. The borough was divided into wards, with three councillors for each ward. There were aldermen at a ratio of one to every six councillors. The chairman of the council received the title of mayor.

==Services==
The vestry started work on an electricity supply service at Eden Grove in 1894, which became operational in 1896. New streets were lit with electric light from 1906. In 1936 electricity showrooms were opened at the corner of Holloway Road and Camden Road. The electric supply service became part of the London Electricity Board following the Electricity Act 1947.

==Poor law==
It was a local act parish so it did not come under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 and the vestry continued to be responsible for poor relief, instead of a separately elected board of guardians. This anomaly was rectified by the Metropolitan Poor Act 1867 (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. 6). The parish was large enough in terms of population to avoid being grouped into a poor law union and remained a single parish for this purpose.

==Town Hall==

Islington Town Hall on Upper Street was the headquarters of Metropolitan Borough of Islington and remains the headquarters of its successor body, Islington London Borough Council.

==Population and area==
The metropolitan borough was conterminous with the Vestry authority, when it was formed in 1900. Statistics compiled by the London County Council, in 1901 show the population growth in London, over the preceding century.

The area of the borough in 1901 was . The populations recorded in National Censuses were:

Islington Vestry 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961

By comparison, after amalgamation with Finsbury, to form the modern London Borough of Islington, the combined area became ; in 2005, this had a population of 182,600, or a population density of 12,288/km2. In 1901 Islington the population density was 26,778/km2.

==Archival records==

Islington Local History Centre holds records of the Metropolitan Borough of Islington, including council and committee minutes, rate books and publications.

==Politics==

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the incorporated vestry of St Mary Islington was divided into six wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 or Upper Holloway (9), No. 2 or Lower Holloway (12), No. 3 or Highbury (15), No. 4 or Thornhill (18), No. 5 or Barnsbury (18), No. 6 or St Mary&#x27;s (15), No. 7 or Canonbury (15) and No. 8 or St Peter&#x27;s (18).

In 1896 as its population had increased the incorporated vestry was re-divided into eleven wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 or Tufnell (12), No. 2 or Upper Holloway (12), No. 3 or Tollington (9), No. 4 or Lower Holloway (15), No. 5 or West Highbury (15), No. 6 or East Highbury (12), No. 7 or Thornhill (9), No. 8 or Barnsbury (6), No. 9 or St Mary&#x27;s (9), No. 10 or Canonbury (9) and No. 11 or St Peter&#x27;s (12).

The metropolitan borough was divided into eleven wards for elections: Barnsbury, Canonbury, Highbury, Lower Holloway, Mildmay, St Mary, St Peter, Thornhill, Tollington, Tufnell and Upper Holloway.

===Borough council===

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was divided into four constituencies:
*Islington East
*Islington North
*Islington South
*Islington West
In 1950 the borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to three seats:
*Islington East
*Islington North
*Islington South West

<doc id="381279" wikidata="Q328735" url="?curid=381279" title="Anabar District">
<text>Anabar is a district in the Pacific country of Nauru.

==Geography==
It is part of the Anabar Constituency. It is located in the northeast of the island, covers an area of 1.5 km2 and has a population of 565 (2021).

==History==
Anabar, along with neighbouring district of Ijuw, is believed to be the 3rd areas to submerged after Buada first and Anibare second about 3000+ years ago.

Its first inhabitants are Deiboe clans people, led by Deianoang, who fled to save his family of three daughters, from the raging war of Atemor&#x27;s open field between Eamwit clansmen off Anuquoge village and his clan, the Deiboe people from Ganokoro.

Irutsi clan was born amongst the rocky regions of Abodeatsi where three men slaves and two slave women met during a month-long hide amidst the rocky region, who five slave people later intermarried each other to expand the population along the rocky regions of Anabar.

Anabar&#x27;s pond &#x27;Tibinor&#x27; was the deepest pond on the island. Such legends like the ones of &#x27;Amwieob&#x27; originated in Anabar.

Like Buada, Anabar had its own dialect, a way of speaking which the natives refer to as the &quot;Kin&#x27;nir&quot;, nothing similar to the &quot;E&#x27;koro&quot; language in the Arenibok village.

==Notable people==
*Ludwig Scotty, President of Nauru in 2003, and from 2004 to 2007, represented Anabar in Parliament of Nauru.

<doc id="381280" wikidata="Q202747" url="?curid=381280" title="Buada District">
<text>Buada is a district in the Pacific nation of Nauru. It is the only district in Buada Constituency. It has a population of 969 (2021). Several things are special about Buada compared to the coastal areas, it is entirely inland, it has a lagoon, and the soil and vegetation here is more rich.

==Geography==
The only landlocked district in the Republic of Nauru, it is in the southwestern part of the island and covers the central Buada Lagoon. Buada is a fertile piece in Nauru and mostly wet and tropical due to the mass vegetation (compared to the rest of the island). It covers an area of , which in comparison with other of Nauru&#x27;s districts, makes it among the largest.

Buada has retained more vegetation than other districts, where, because of mining, much vegetation has been lost. The proximity of the Buada Lagoon has been relevant to the survival of vegetation.

==Climate==
Buada has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round.
==History==
The district held the ancient name Arenibok as early as the 1500s to the late 1800s. The Germans referred to it as &#x27;Bush Village&#x27; (1889) after agreeing to its new boundaries located by the Germans, the locals during 1890 named it Buada (ghost land) which is still referred to nowadays.

The last of the few Irutsi clans consisting of four members only, along with the largest of all clans, the Eamwit, inhabited Buada ever since it was known by its original name Arenibok. Few of the other two clans, namely the Emea and the Deiboe clans, also resided with their relatives in Buada

The 10 years Nauruan Tribal War began in this district during a wedding festival in Aujo hamlet in 1878, when a drunk white opened fire and accidentally killed the lad Giubu of the Eamwit clan, nephew of chief Teiauw of the Eaoru clan and a great-nephew of the chief Aremwa.

Arenibok (now Buada) had four main villages, namely Arenibok and Redeto, villages on the banks of the great Arenibok Sea (now Buada Lagoon) and two other villages of Noreo on the steep slopes towards the south and Aujo with its few hamlets towards inland to the north.

==Notable people==
*Ruben Kun, who represented Buada in the Parliament of Nauru, served as President of Nauru from 1996 to 1997.
*Roland Kun (son of Ruben Kun) is the current (2012) representative for Buada district to the Parliament of Nauru.

<doc id="381286" wikidata="Q917820" url="?curid=381286" title="London Museum">
<text>The London Museum (formerly known as the Museum of London) is a museum in London, covering the history of the city from prehistoric to modern times, with a particular focus on social history. The Museum of London was formed in 1976 by amalgamating the collection previously held by the City Corporation at the Guildhall Museum (founded in 1826) and that of the London Museum (founded in 1911). From 1976 to 2022, its main site was in the City of London on London Wall, close to the Barbican Centre, part of the Barbican complex of buildings created in the 1960s and &#x27;70s to redevelop a bomb-damaged area of the city. In 2015, the museum revealed plans to move to the General Market Building at the nearby Smithfield site. Reasons for the proposed move included the claim that the current site was difficult for visitors to find, and that by expanding, from 17,000 square metres to 27,000, a greater proportion of the museum&#x27;s collection could be placed on display. In December 2022, the museum permanently closed its site at London Wall in preparation for reopening in 2026 at Smithfield Market. The museum changed its name and branding to &quot;London Museum&quot; in July 2024 in advance of the move.

The museum has the largest urban history collection in the world, with more than six 
million objects. It is primarily concerned with the social history of London and its inhabitants throughout time. Its collections include archaeological material, such as flint handaxes from the prehistoric Thames Valley, marble statues from a Roman temple called the London Mithraeum, and a cache of Elizabethan and Jacobean jewellery called the Cheapside Hoard. Its modern collections include large amounts of decorative objects, clothing and costumes, paintings, prints and drawings, social history objects, and oral histories. The museum continues to collect contemporary objects, such as the Whitechapel fatberg and the Trump baby blimp.

The museum is part of a group that also includes two other locations: London Museum Docklands, which is based in West India Quay and remains open to the public; and the Museum of London Archaeological Archive, based at Mortimer Wheeler House. The museum is jointly controlled and funded by the City of London Corporation and the Greater London Authority. Its current director is Sharon Ament.

== History ==

=== The Guildhall Museum (1826–1976) ===
One of the two museums that were merged to form the Museum of London was the Guildhall Museum, founded by the City of London Corporation in 1826 when it received the gift of a Roman mosaic from Tower Street as &quot;a suitable place for the reception of such Antiquities as relate to the City of London and Suburbs&quot;. As the collection grew, it was given a room in the London Guildhall. The museum focused on archaeological remains from the city, and objects linked to the corporation, and had a particularly strong collection of Roman objects. It was mostly inaccessible to the public until 1872, when work was begun on dedicated premises in Basinghall Street. During World War II, the museum closed so that the corporation could use the building for other purposes, and after the war, in 1955, it re-opened in the Royal Exchange. However, this was not seen as a satisfactory long-term solution, and in 1960 the museum seriously started to engage with the scheme to merge with the London Museum.

=== The London Museum (1912–1976) ===
The museum has its origins in, and derives much of its collection from, the London Museum, founded in 1911 by Viscount Esher and Lewis Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt and originally based in the State Apartments of Kensington Palace. It first opened to the public on 8 April 1912. Harcourt became the first Commissioner of Works, and the first Keeper was Guy Francis Laking. In 1913, it became a National Museum.

In 1914, it moved to Lancaster House, which had been bought by William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme, soap magnate and founder of the model town of Port Sunlight, and given to the nation as a home for the London Museum. Visitors travelled through a mostly chronological route, entering the Prehistoric Room, the Roman Room, the Saxon and Early Norman Gallery, the Mediaeval Room, and finally a Jewellery Room before heading to the upper floor. Here, they would find the Tudor Room, the Early Seventeenth Century, the Late Seventeenth Century, a room with a large collection of porcelain, the Late Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Room, and finally, the Costume Gallery. The museum also contained a basement which contained come exhibits from all eras, some of which were too large for the main galleries, and which could serve as an introduction to the collections. It included a Roman boat, a carriage belonging to the Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, a parlour decorated in the Stuart style, and prison cells.

The Keeper of the London Museum from 1926 to 1944, Sir Mortimer Wheeler, proposed merging the London Museum with the Guildhall Museum as early as 1927, as the two museums had a significant overlap in their collections, but the scheme wasn&#x27;t given serious thought until after both museums had been forced to close during World War II.

During the war, the museum closed, and in 1945 it vacated Lancaster House so that the government could use the space for hospitality events. The trustees considered several sites for the new museum, including Holland House and various sites on the South Bank. However, in the end, King George VI leased part of Kensington Palace for the museum to move back in. The new site opened in 1951.

The Kensington Palace museum kept a generally chronological structure to its layout, but alongside the rooms devoted to various time periods, there were separate galleries for historical shop fronts; prints; theatre; glass; paintings, toys and games; and royal costume. The glass room included Sir Richard Garton&#x27;s collection of 437 pieces of 17th-19th century table glass, including goblets, wine glasses, bowls, candlesticks and decanters. The Print Room comprised around 3,000 watercolours and drawings and 7,000 prints, including a view of Whitehall and Westminster by Hendrick Danckerts made c.1675, &quot;The Cries of London&quot; by Paul Sandby, and works by Thomas Rowlandson, Wenceslaus Hollar, and James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The Theatre room included many theatrical costumes, several on loan from the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. These included Henry Irving&#x27;s costumes for Malvolio and King Lear, the dress Anna Pavlova wore as The Dying Swan, and Ivor Novello&#x27;s costume from &quot;The King&#x27;s Rhapsody.&quot; There was also a clown costume worn by the comedy pioneer Joseph Grimaldi, a piano belonging to W. S. Gilbert, a death mask of David Garrick, and Walter Lambert&#x27;s &quot;Popularity&quot;, a painting of dozens of music hall and variety stars. By the 1970s, multiple coronation robes were on display, from 1838, 1902, 1911, and 1937. There were also other items of royal clothing belonging to Charles I, a collection of Queen Victoria&#x27;s dresses, and Princess Margaret&#x27;s wedding dress designed by Norman Hartnell.
In 1960, a plan was formed to merge the London Museum with the Guildhall Museum, to be funded jointly by the government, the City of London Corporation, and the Greater London Council. An act of Parliament, the (c. 17), was passed to this effect in 1965. The City of London Corporation provided a site near what is now the Barbican Centre.

=== Museum of London (1976–2022) ===

The new site for the museum was at the corner of London Wall and Aldersgate Street, an area that had almost entirely been flattened by bombing in The Blitz. The architects appointed to oversee the construction of the new museum building were Philip Powell and Hidalgo Moya, who designed a complex with four main parts: a tower block containing offices and not open to the public; two floors of exhibition space arranged around a courtyard; a lecture theatre and education wing; and a rotunda containing a small garden and restaurant. With the museum galleries themselves, Powell and Moya adopted an innovative approach to museum design, whereby the galleries were laid out so that there was only one route through the museum – from the prehistoric period to the modern galleries. As in the previous incarnation of the museum, the galleries would be set out in a roughly chronological order. The building also incorporated a viewing window out onto one of the remaining pieces of London&#x27;s city wall, originally built by the Romans around three sides of the city. Construction began in April 1971, with the foundation stone laid by the Queen Mother on 29 March 1973, and the museum was opened in December 1976 by Queen Elizabeth II as part of the Barbican Estate.As in the London Museum, visitors entered a series of rooms set out in chronological order, moving anti-clockwise around the main courtyard on the upper floor through London&#x27;s history up to the Great Fire in 1666, and then descending to the lower level and moving clockwise around the courtyard up to the present day. Visitors would finish their visit by the Lord Mayor of London&#x27;s State Coach.

In November 2002, the previous &quot;The Thames In Prehistory&quot; gallery was replaced with an entirely new display titled &quot;London Before London&quot;.

A £20 million redevelopment called the &quot;Galleries of Modern London&quot; was completed in May 2010, the museum&#x27;s biggest investment since opening in 1976. The redesign, by London-based architects Wilkinson Eyre, comprised the entire lower floor of the main galleries, covering the period from the 1670s to the present day. The Galleries of Modern London displayed a total of 7,000 objects. Star exhibits included a mummified cat, a 1928 Art Deco lift from Selfridges department store on Oxford Street, and a complete 18th century debtors&#x27; prison cell covered in graffiti.

The transformation included four new galleries. The &quot;Expanding City&quot; gallery covered the period 1670–1850. &quot;People&#x27;s City&quot; addressed 1850-1940s, including a &quot;Victorian Walk&quot; displaying some of the museum&#x27;s real office and shop frontages and interiors; objects relating to the suffragette movement; and pages of Charles Booth&#x27;s 1888 &quot;poverty map&quot;, colour-coding London&#x27;s streets according to the relative wealth of their inhabitants. &quot;World City&quot; was the gallery containing objects dating from the 1950s to the present day, including 1950s suits, a Mary Quant dress from the 1960s, Biba fashion in the 1970s, outfits from London&#x27;s punk scene, and a pashmina from Alexander McQueen&#x27;s 2008 collection. Finally, the &quot;City Gallery&quot; featured large, street-level windows along London Wall that allowed passers-by to view the Lord Mayor of London&#x27;s State Coach, which takes to the streets each November for the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show.

In 2014, the museum opened a new gallery displaying the cauldron from the 2012 Summer Olympics. The cauldron was made up of 204 steel stems, each tipped with a copper &quot;petal&quot;, which could be raised or lowered to create various formations. When all the petals were raised to their full height, they together formed the shape of a cauldron. The gallery featured 97 of the original stems, wooden moulds for the copper petals, Great Britain&#x27;s Paralympic petal, and footage showing the cauldron in use during the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympiad. The room also showed interviews with some of the creators, including lead designer Thomas Heatherwick and an engineer called Gemma Webster.

=== London Museum (2022–present) ===

In 2016, the museum announced it would be closing its London Wall site and moving to a set of disused market buildings in West Smithfield in 2021. The new site will increase the museum&#x27;s size from 17,000 square metres to over 27,000. Museum director Sharon Ament said that one reason for the move was &quot;a failing building with problematic entrances and a location which is difficult to find&quot;. A competition was held to find an architectural firm to design the new building, with over 70 firms taking part. Six were shortlisted, and their initial designs released to the public in 2016. Stanton Williams and Asif Khan were chosen as the final architects.

The site at Smithfield includes part of the Thameslink train line running into Farringdon Station, and from an early point in the process, the museum expressed interest in creating a see-through section of tunnel for commuters to glimpse inside the museum and visitors to see the train go by. It also includes the River Fleet, a tributary of the Thames which has long since become buried underground due to the high volume of construction work around it. One early plan for the new museum, since scrapped, included creating a well reaching down to the Fleet, which has been completely covered since the 1870s. Another idea for the new museum is to revive the ancient St Bartholomew&#x27;s Fair, which took place on the site regularly in the medieval period until being shut down by authorities in 1855. The museum will also feature spiral escalators taking visitors to the underground storage rooms which will function as the main historical galleries.

In 2019, further plans were released, which showed late-night queues outside the museum frontage and visitors perusing real items from the museum&#x27;s collection. Ament announced that workers had found the remains of a Victorian café called the Temperance Cocoa Room, complete with original tiling, and that the museum intended to re-open this section as a café.

The scheme was originally set to cost £250 million and open in 2021; current estimates are that it will cost £337 million and open in 2026. Ament blamed the rising cost on the difficulty of working with an old building: &quot;It is to do with things like waterproofing a building that hasn&#x27;t needed to be water-proofed, it is to do with engineering&quot;.

In August 2022, the museum announced that a previously unknown freshwater spring had been found underneath the new site. Tests revealed that it was safe to drink, and Ament claimed that she hoped visitors would be able to &quot;fill up their water bottles from it&quot;.

On 4 December 2022, the museum closed its site at London Wall ahead of the move. It was also announced that when the new site opened in 2026, it would be called the London Museum.

Once the museum has vacated the London Wall site, it will revert to the City of London Corporation. In 2019, plans were revealed to use the site to house a London Centre For Music, a £288m concert hall for use by the London Symphony Orchestra. However, in 2022, the Corporation submitted plans to demolish the building, including the Bastion House office block above, and replace it with a 780,000 sq. ft office block, citing dangerous structural issues, poor energy performance, fire safety and limited possible uses as reasons in favour of demolition. In May 2024, demolition remained the likely option after the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Michael Gove decided not to intervene, and in November 2024 Historic England issued a Certificate of Immunity from Listing, guaranteeing that the building would not be statutorily listed within the next five years.

== Collections ==
The museum holds in its collections objects covering 10,000 years of London&#x27;s history, totalling around 7 million objects. It combines the original collections of both the Guildhall Museum and London Museum, plus objects that the Museum of London acquired since its foundation in the 1970s, such as archaeological finds, photographs, oral histories, and video games.

In particular, the museum owns a large collection of objects relating to London&#x27;s docks, leading to the opening of a secondary site, the London Museum Docklands, in 2003.

=== Pre-modern collections ===
The museum has over 13,000 prehistoric objects, including the Havering Hoard, the largest Bronze Age hoard thus far discovered in London, and the third-largest of its kind in the UK. It includes 453 bronze objects, such as axe heads, spearheards and knives made between 900 and 800 BCE, which had almost all been broken or damaged, and buried carefully in four separate groups around the site. The museum put on a temporary exhibition of the hoard at its Docklands site in 2020.

The Roman collection totals over 47,000 objects, mostly from the Roman-occupied areas of the City of London and Southwark, including the UK&#x27;s largest collection of terra sigillata (samianware). It also includes entire wall paintings and floors such as the Bucklersbury Mosaic; metalwork such as hipposandals, cutlery, jewellery and tweezers; four leather &quot;bikini bottoms&quot;, possibly worn by female acrobats; and a wooden ladder. In September 1954, a Roman temple to the god Mithras was discovered in the City of London. An estimated 400,000 members of the public visited the site while it was being excavated, a job which was mostly carried out by archaeology students led by the then director of the London Museum, W. F. Grimes. The building stones of the temple have been reconstructed on their original site at the London Mithraeum, while the marble carvings found inside are part of the collections of the London Museum.

The museum owns around 12,000 medieval objects, including 700 from the Saxon period, and over 1,350 pewter pilgrim badges.

===Early modern and modern collections===
The museum holds over 1,500 pieces of Tudor and Stuart cutlery, mostly recovered from the Thames, and some purchased from the private collection of Hilton Price. One of the most well-known and popular groups in the museum&#x27;s collection from this period is the Cheapside Hoard, a hoard of almost 500 Tudor and Jacobean pieces of jewellery found in 1912 on Cheapside in the City of London. The entire hoard went on display for the first time as a temporary exhibition at the museum in 2013. In 2017, it was announced that the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths would donate £10 million to the museum in order to secure a permanent display for the Cheapside Hoard at the new museum site in West Smithfield.

Demonstrating London&#x27;s manufacturing prowess has been one of the museum&#x27;s goals since the inception of the London Museum in 1911.To that end, the museum has pieces from London manufacturers like James Powell and Sons, also known as Whitefriars Glass; and Martin Brothers; and objects related to trades such as clockmaking, coopering, silk-weaving, engraving, and silversmithing. Donors such as Joan Evans, Catherine d&#x27;Erlanger, Mary of Teck, Jane Anne Gordon and Lady Cory have enlarged the museum&#x27;s collection of jewellery, particularly mourning jewellery, chatelaines and costume jewellery.

The museum also collects more general social and working history objects relating to the everyday lives and trade of ordinary Londoners. This includes shop fronts, food packaging, telephone kiosks, vehicles, and a large collection of &quot;penny toys&quot;- toys costing a penny. The museum holds an internationally important collection of suffragette material, largely from the archive of the suffrage group, the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union; the archives of the Whitefriars Glassworks, and papers relating to Kibbo Kift, and a substantial amount of material relating to London&#x27;s port and the River Thames, much of which is on display at the museum&#x27;s secondary site, the London Museum Docklands. The museum holds over 5,000 hours of oral histories; and the archives of the Port of London Authority and the supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s.

=== Contemporary collecting ===

The museum also collects contemporary objects, including those connected to national news stories. During the 2012 London Summer Olympics, the Museum of London collected tweets using the hashtag #citizencurators, both by the public and by a select group of 18 contributors from across the city.

In 2016, the museum attempted to buy a water-cannon truck bought by then-Mayor of London Boris Johnson. In the summer of 2014, Johnson bought three water cannon trucks from the German federal police for £218,000 in order to combat civil unrest. These were then banned for use in the UK by Home Secretary Theresa May, and could not be deployed. Johnson attempted to sell them. The museum tried to buy one, but the trucks were only available to European policing or civil protection organisations. Unable to find a buyer, the trucks were sold to a reclamation yard in 2018 for £3,675 each. The museum&#x27;s director, Sharon Ament, expressed interest in collecting some of the scrap or salvage, but no part of the trucks has yet entered the museum&#x27;s collection.

In 2018, the museum displayed a section of the Whitechapel fatberg, a solid lump of fat and grease that had formed in the sewer network underneath Whitechapel. After being on display for several months, the chunk was removed from the galleries and placed in a freezer, where fans could view it around the clock on a live webcam.
In January 2021, the museum acquired a giant inflatable blimp depicting former US President Donald Trump as a giant baby. The 6 metre-high blimp was designed by Matt Bonner to protest Trump&#x27;s visit to the UK in 2018, and has since been flown around the world in protest of the president&#x27;s regime.

In April 2020, the museum put out a call for donations of objects and oral histories connected to the global COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the Collecting Covid project, London Zoo donated a large illuminated sign showing the logo of the UK&#x27;s National Health Service surrounded by hearts, which was hung outside their giraffe house during lockdown in March 2020. In July 2020, sound designers String and Tins made recordings of soundscapes in London streets that had become deserted due to pandemic lockdowns for the museum&#x27;s collection. In October 2020, Arsenal football player Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang donated his shirt featuring a Black Lives Matter logo, which had been worn by him during games that season. The logo had been added to all Premier League shirts for the summer 2020 season following widespread protests against racial violence in London and around the world.

During celebrations for the Islamic festival of Ramadan, the museum collected thousands of messages from a WhatsApp group made up of five Muslim women in West London sharing their reflections on celebrating during lockdown. In January 2021, the museum announced the acquisition of thirteen tweets made by Londoners during lockdown. In February 2021, Mayor of Lambeth Philip Normal donated his chain of office, which he had made from card and t-shirt fabric while the real one was locked up in the town hall. Normal had a virtual appointment ceremony to the role in April 2020. The museum also asked volunteers to describe their &quot;pandemic dreams&quot; to collect oral histories of how the pandemic affected Londoners&#x27; sleep cycles.

===Costume collection===

The museum has 23,000 pieces of dress and textiles. The London Museum was the first British museum to produce a catalogue of its costume collection, in 1933. The museum&#x27;s collection includes pieces by Lucile, Hardy Amies, Norman Hartnell, Victor Stiebel, Mary Quant, Katharine Hamnett, and Vivienne Westwood. It also includes several pieces of royal clothing, including a shirt thought to have belonged to Charles I; many theatrical, ballet, circus, music hall, and opera costumes; and silk garments woven in Spitalfields. Outside of clothing, the museum holds banners and sashes related to the female suffrage campaign of the early 20th century, the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift, and dockworker trade unions. The dress collection includes several objects examined by fashion historian Janet Arnold in her book series &quot;Patterns of Fashion&quot;.

===Art and photography collections===
The museum holds over 100,000 paintings, prints and drawings, including works by Wenceslaus Hollar, Paul Sandby, Canaletto, William Powell Frith, George Elgar Hicks, Walter Greaves, Henry Moore, Graham Sutherland, Thomas Rowlandson, C. R. W. Nevinson, and Spencer Gore. The museum&#x27;s collection also contains portraits of London figures such as military leader and politician Oliver Cromwell and suffrage campaigner and activist Sylvia Pankhurst; and several panoramas and views of London such as the Rhinebeck Panorama, an 180° aerial view made around 1806, looking west from where Tower Bridge stands today.

The London Museum has collected around 150,000 photographs focussing on everyday life in London. The earliest example dates from c.1845 and shows a view of the then-newly opened Hungerford Bridge taken by Henry Fox Talbot. Other photographs include views of London dating back to c.1855 by Roger Fenton; Bill Brandt&#x27;s series taken inside World War II air raid shelters; scenes of the building of the first line of what is now the London Underground transport network; pictures of suffragette protests taken by pioneering female photographer Christina Broom; and works by British photographer Henry Grant. The largest work in this collection is a camera obscura print made by Vera Lutter showing Battersea Power Station, at 7 feet (2.1m) high.

=== London Museum Docklands ===
In 2003, the museum opened the Museum in Docklands (later renamed the Museum of London Docklands and then London Museum Docklands) in a 19th-century grade I listed warehouse near Canary Wharf on the Isle of Dogs. The London Museum Docklands charts the history of London as a port, beginning 2,000 years ago with the Roman trading post set up on the banks of the Thames and following London&#x27;s expansion into the biggest port the world had ever known. In November 2007, it opened the capital&#x27;s first permanent gallery examining London&#x27;s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, &quot;London, Sugar &amp; Slavery&quot;.

=== Museum of London Archaeology ===

Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) is an archaeology and built heritage practice that was originally part of the Museum of London, but became an independent charity in November 2011, regulated by the Charity Commission for England and Wales. It employs 310 staff and works not just in London, but across the UK and internationally. It is based at Mortimer Wheeler House in Shoreditch. 

==Governance==
The London Museum and London Museum Docklands are part of the same group.

<text>Nauru Air Corporation, trading as Nauru Airlines (formerly trading as Our Airline and Air Nauru), is the flag carrier of the Republic of Nauru. It operates scheduled international services to other Pacific islands and Australia. Its main base is Nauru International Airport. Its head office is on the property of Nauru International Airport, Yaren District and its operations office is in Brisbane in the Australian state of Queensland. In August 2014, the airline changed its name from Our Airline to Nauru Airlines.

== History ==
Nauru Airlines was established as Air Nauru on 17 September 1969, and started operations on 14 February 1970. Regular scheduled services commenced after the delivery in January 1972 of the airline&#x27;s first Fokker F28 Fellowship twin jet, which was followed by a second. A Boeing 737-200C was added to the fleet in 1975 and a Boeing 727-100 entered service on 16 June 1976. Later in the 1970s the two Fellowships were sold and more Boeings were added to the fleet.

By 1983 the fleet included seven aircraft: two Boeing 727-100s and five Boeing 737-200s; since the entire population of Nauru at this time was about 8,000, the airline was in the position of having seating capacity equal to 10% of the Nauruan population. The airline also had a bad reputation for cancelling flights at the whim of its government owners, including using the Boeing 727s for low-level searches for Nauruan fisherman lost at sea while relatives on board were served alcohol by the flight attendants. From this high point (at least in terms of fleet numbers) the airline gradually contracted in size, leasing some aircraft and selling others. Five years later in 1988 the fleet consisted of three Boeing 737-200s with the one remaining 727-100 leased out to Trans Australia Airlines. At this time the airline was badly affected by an industrial dispute with its pilots and was operating without a set timetable, a situation that lasted for several months.

In the early 1990s, an Air Nauru 737 was chartered to operate the Auckland-Niue route of Niue Airlines, the latter company&#x27;s only service.

In 1993 two of the 737-200s were replaced by Boeing 737-400s, leaving the Boeing 737-200C to soldier on for a little while longer. The airline, by now only operating a single 737-400, was corporatised in July 1996 as the Nauru Air Corporation (NAC).

Mismanagement of the island&#x27;s wealth and the resulting economic troubles caused the airline to lose large amounts of money, and on some occasions become insolvent. Its operations were also suspended for brief periods in the 1990s because of concerns raised by Australia over the airworthiness and safety record of its aircraft. Airline offices and equipment were also frequently repossessed by the Australian government for Nauru&#x27;s repeated defaults on foreign loans. The airline became in dispute with the Export-Import Bank of the United States in 2002, and in December 2005 the High Court of Australia upheld an earlier decision to allow the bank to seize Air Nauru&#x27;s only aircraft, leaving Nauru and the island nation of Kiribati without air services. The aircraft was seized by creditors at Melbourne Airport on 18 December 2005. Following the acquisition of a replacement aircraft (a Boeing 737-300) in mid-2006, the airline was rebranded as Our Airline and relaunched on 14 October 2006. Our Airline was renamed Nauru Airlines on 1 August 2014.

Nauru Airlines is now wholly owned by the state and had 65 employees in July 2012.

== Destinations ==

Nauru Airlines serves the following destinations as of December 2023:

===Historical destinations===

Air Nauru once had a remarkably comprehensive network in the Asia-Pacific, with services to:

The average load factor throughout the network was only around 20%, with many flights carrying no or few passengers. The Nauru government subsidized the airline with profits from phosphate mining. Due to the phosphate reserves depleting in the early 1990s, along with the mismanagement of the island&#x27;s mineral reserves, the airline began to cease services to unprofitable destinations.

=== Relaunch of services ===

Since relaunching services in 2006, the airline has repeatedly adjusted its route map. When the airline initially resumed services in 2006, it offered a twice-weekly service from Brisbane to Honiara, Nauru, Tarawa, and Majuro. These were quickly curtailed, with flights to Majuro eliminated. The Tarawa extension was suspended from July 2008 to November 2009 because, along with the high fuel prices of the time, operating the Tarawa flight was not profitable without a connecting destination. The Tarawa extension was suspended again in 2011 because of disputes, but it was resumed in early 2012. Meanwhile, Honiara service was suspended around the same time.

Although it had been reported in early 2007 that Our Airline would begin services between Nauru and Fiji in the very near future, the airline instead provided once weekly Tarawa to Nadi service on behalf of Air Kiribati beginning in November 2009. However, the service between Nauru and Fiji which began in 2010 ceased in December 2011 due to a dispute between the governments of Kiribati and Fiji. This was replaced with a bi-weekly service that operated from Nauru to Nadi nonstop.

As of December 2019, Nauru Airlines served four destinations from its base in Nauru: Brisbane, Majuro, Nadi, and Tarawa. However, three of these destinations have since been discontinued and the airline currently only has limited service to Brisbane. Thus, the Nauru Airlines service between Brisbane and Nauru is now the only scheduled service of any airline to Nauru.

In May 2023, Nauru Airlines applied to the US Department of Transport for permission to fly scheduled cargo and passenger flights to Guam using B737 equipment. In 2017, the airline successfully obtained a five-year foreign carrier&#x27;s permit allowing such flights but due to Covid-19 and other reasons, never used the permit. The filing also said the airline was in the final stages of securing a B737-800SF which will be registered as VH-8TG (msn 33003).

==Services provided to Norfolk Island==

Norfolk Island&#x27;s Norfolk Jet Express and Norfolk Air had chartered Our Airline to fly services between Norfolk Island and Brisbane, Newcastle, Melbourne and Sydney. Norfolk Jet Express went out of business on 4 June 2005. A government operated airline, called Norfolk Air, was then established but with no aircraft of its own, Qantas operated the flights from 11 June 2005 using Air Nauru&#x27;s Boeing 737-400. This arrangement ceased later that year, when the aircraft was seized due to Air Nauru&#x27;s own financial problems. Other airlines filled the gap for Norfolk Air, but Air Nauru again started providing aircraft for Norfolk Air flights in April 2009. The Norfolk government closed down Norfolk Air in March 2012, with a new agreement that Air New Zealand would take over the Norfolk Island flights, using its own aircraft.

==Fleet==
The Nauru Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of December 2023):

Previously operated jet aircraft:

* Boeing 727-100
* Boeing 737-200
* Boeing 737-400
* Dassault Falcon 20
* Fokker F28-1000 Fellowship

In March 2006, the government of the Republic of China, reportedly as a reward for Nauru&#x27;s diplomatic recognition of the ROC instead of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, assisted Air Nauru with the purchase of a second-hand Boeing 737, which was expected to be in operation by mid-2006, after several logistical delays. This purchase was put on hold in May 2006 due to OzJet and Air Pacific (now Fiji Airways) having started on the routes formerly operated by Air Nauru. In October 2006 the new Boeing plane came into service. The plane was registered as VH-INU and named as &#x27;Naoero&#x27;. In 2008, the Airline bought their second Boeing 737-300 adorned with a full Norfolk Air livery, remaining till now despite Norfolk Air&#x27;s current state of closure. The plane was registered as VH-NLK. Later in March 2013, the Airline purchased a Boeing 737-300 from GECAS. The plane was painted in the &#x27;Our Airline&#x27; livery in Melbourne, making its first visit to Brisbane Airport on 3 September 2013.

<text>Hanga Roa (; , [ˈha.ŋa ˈɾo.a]) (Rapanui language: &quot;Long bay&quot;) is the main town, harbour and seat of Easter Island, a municipality of Chile. It is located in the southern part of the island&#x27;s west coast, in the lowlands between the extinct volcanoes of Terevaka and Rano Kau.

==History==
&quot;Hanga Roa&quot; in the native Rapa Nui language means &quot;wide bay&quot; or &quot;long bay&quot;.

Upon Chile&#x27;s claim of the island, the Rapa Nui were forced in Hanga Roa, and the rest of the land was leased to a sheep farm. For much of the twentieth century, the rest of the island was leased to the Compañía Explotadora de la Isla de Pascua (CEDIP) (a subsidiary of Williamson-Balfour Company) and closed to the Rapa Nui.

Some disagreements between the government of Chile and the Rapa Nui have led the locals with ancestral roots to &quot;take over&quot; many hotels in the city. For the locals, it is a way to draw the line between the Chilean government&#x27;s policy-making in the island, and the Rapa Nui&#x27;s ancestral rights on their land. In 2011, the Schiess family, owner of the Hanga Roa Hotel, donated back the land of the hotel to the Rapa Nui, but retained a 30-year management lease of the hotel. A week before, the Schiess family had personally shipped a special force squad from the Carabineros de Chile to remove the locals who squatted the hotel. A prior police intervention in August 2010 had led to 25 Rapa Nui protesters being wounded.

==Geography==
The island&#x27;s main avenue, Avenida Atamu Tekena (formerly Avenida Policarpo Toro), is the heart of the town. Many hotels, restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies are found alongside this road. In 1998, the road was renamed after nineteenth century Rapanui king Atamu Te Kena; it had previously been named after Captain Policarpo Toro, the Chilean Naval officer who annexed Easter Island to Chile in 1888. The island&#x27;s museum, and also the Roman Catholic &quot;Holy Cross Church&quot;, are located in the center of town. With the advent of the Internet and the expansion of communication services by the Chilean government, many internet cafes and automated teller machines (ATM) have appeared in recent years.

==Population==
In 1914, the population of Hanga Roa was just 250 and the rest of the island was inhabited by large populations of sheep.

The population of Easter Island was last measured at 7,750 people. The main town of Easter Island is Hanga Roa. Its population was last measured at 7,322 residents. This means that roughly that 95% of the island&#x27;s population live in this city.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
The town has a number of hotels and guesthouses which cater for tourists who come to see the island&#x27;s World Heritage Sites, in particular the famous moai statues. Hanga Roa and the surrounding area have a number of moai, but there are larger ones elsewhere on the island. Total capacity is about 2,500 beds as of 2022, ranging from camping sites to luxury hotels, including hotel Hanga Roa.

The Ahu Tahai archaeological complex is within a walking distance from the city&#x27;s center. Every year, the city is home to the &quot;farandula&quot; cultural festival, a months-long event when the locals sculpt giant wooden statues. The celebration includes a habit where people get nude and bath in clay that covers their bodies.

===Other activities===
In addition to tourism, other businesses in Hanga Roa include fishing, farming and administration. Several Chilean government departments including the Chilean Navy maintain a presence on the island.

The harbour has a shipping service to Valparaíso, Chile. In April 2018, the freighter &quot;Lago Icalma&quot;, parked in the port of Hanga Roa, was struck by a barge. A fuel tank was ruptured, leaking diesel fuel in the waters of the port. The surrounding beaches were also blackened by the spread of the black liquid.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
The island&#x27;s only airport, Mataveri International Airport, is served by LATAM Airlines, Chile&#x27;s national carrier, which offers direct 5-hour flights from Santiago. It is the only commercial carrier that regularly serves the island.

===Health===
A new hospital was opened in 2013, replacing an older one donated in the 1970s by the United States. The hospital has a capacity of 16 beds, and includes a delivery ward designed to also allow the practice of folk medicine. It is the only healthcare facility on the island.

===Education===
Among several schools are the &quot;Colegio Lorenzo Baeza Vega&quot;, which offers primary education with a focus on teaching traditional culture and language, and &quot;Liceo Aldea Educativa&quot;, which offers qualification in the areas of humanist studies, tourism and agriculture.

==Sport==
Hanga Roa has a multi-use stadium, the Estadio de Hanga Roa, which is the home ground of the CF Rapa Nui, the football team representing Easter Island.

==Access to food==
The regular consumer brands sold in grocery stores are expensive due to the costly and time-consuming trip required to import those products. Locals informally sell fish, meat and vegetables. The tuna empanada is the city&#x27;s favourite snack.

<text>A stuffed toy is a toy doll with an outer fabric sewn from a textile and stuffed with flexible material. They are known by many names, such as plush toys, plushies, lovies, stuffed animals, and stuffies; in Britain and Australia, they may also be called soft toys or cuddly toys. The stuffed toy originated from the Steiff company of Germany in the late 19th century and gained popularity following the creation of the teddy bear in the United States in 1903. At the same time, German toy inventor Richard Steiff designed a similar bear. In 1903, Peter Rabbit was the first fictional character to be made into a patented stuffed toy. In 1921, Christopher Robin&#x27;s stuffed toy, given to him by his father, A. A. Milne, would inspire the creation of Winnie-the-Pooh. In the 1970s, London-based Hamleys, the world&#x27;s oldest toy store, bought the rights to Paddington Bear stuffed toys. In the 1990s, Ty Warner created Beanie Babies, a series of animals stuffed with plastic pellets that were popular as collector&#x27;s items.

Stuffed toys are made in many different forms, but most resemble real animals (sometimes with exaggerated proportions or features), mythological creatures, cartoon characters, or inanimate objects. They can be commercially or home-produced from numerous materials, most commonly pile textiles like plush for the outer material and synthetic fiber for the stuffing. Often these toys are designed for children, but stuffed toys are popular for a range of ages and uses and have been marked by fads in popular culture that sometimes affected collectors and the value of the toys. 

== Description ==

Stuffed toys are distinguishable from other toys mainly by their softness, flexibility, and resemblance to animals or fictional characters. Stuffed toys most commonly take the form of animals, especially bears (in the case of teddy bears), mammalian pets such as cats and dogs, and highly recognizable animals such as zebras, tigers, pandas, lizards, and elephants. Many fictional animal-like characters from movies, TV shows, books, or other entertainment forms often appear in stuffed toy versions, as do both real and fictional humans if the individual or character is famous enough. These toys are filled with soft plush material.

Stuffed toys come in an array of different sizes, with the smallest being thumb-sized and the largest being larger than a house. However, the largest somewhat commonly produced stuffed toys are not much bigger than a person. Most stuffed toys are designed to be an appropriate size for easy cuddling. They also come in a wide variety of colors, cloth surfaces, fur textures, and humanizing embellishments.

Stuffed toys are commonly sold in stores worldwide. Vendors are often abundant at tourist attractions, airports, carnivals, fairs, downtown parks, and general public meeting places of almost any nature, especially if there are children present.

==History==
Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote in 1835: 
&quot;Bring’ uns, lieber Weihnachtsmann, 
Bring’ auch morgen, bringe
Musketier und Grenadier,
Zottelbär und Pantherthier,
Roß und Esel, Schaf und Stier,
Lauter schöne Dinge!&quot;
which can be translated as: &quot;Dear Father Christmas, bring us musketeer and grenadier, shaggy bear and panther, steed and donkey, sheep and steer: lots of lovely things.&quot;

In 1878, The Delineator, an American magazine that offered sewing patterns, offered a &quot;Pattern for an elephant and blanket&quot; that was intended to be a child&#x27;s toy.

Two years later, the first known commercially available stuffed felt elephant originally sold as a pincushion, was made by Margarete Steiff, founder of the German Steiff company in 1880, using the Delinator pattern. Steiff used newly developed technology for manufacturing upholstery to make its stuffed toys. In 1892, the Ithaca Kitty became one of the first mass-produced stuffed animal toys in the United States, which was sold as &quot;The Tabby Cat&quot; printed pattern on muslin by Arnold Print Works.
The toy industry significantly expanded in the early 20th century. In 1903, Richard Steiff, nephew of Margarete, designed a soft stuffed bear that differed from earlier traditional rag dolls because it was made of plush furlike fabric. As an art student in Stuttgart he visited the zoo and sketched the bears, which became the inspiration for his first life-like toy bear, known as &quot;55 PB&quot;. At the same time, in the US, Morris Michtom created the first teddy bear after being inspired by a drawing of President &quot;Teddy&quot; Roosevelt with a bear cub. In 1903, the character Peter Rabbit from English author Beatrix Potter was the first fictional character to be made into a patented stuffed toy. The following year they went on sale and were mass produced by Steiff. The popularity of stuffed toys grew, with numerous manufacturers forming in Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Many people also handmade their own stuffed toys. For instance, sock monkeys originated when parents turned old socks into toys during the Great Depression.

In 1921, A. A. Milne bought a stuffed toy from Harrods department store in London for his son Christopher Robin, a toy which would later inspire the author&#x27;s creation of Winnie-the-Pooh. Stuffed toys of Paddington Bear, a character created by Michael Bond, were first produced by the family of Jeremy Clarkson in 1972, with the family eventually selling the rights to London-based Hamleys, the world&#x27;s oldest toy store. More recent lines of stuffed animals have been created around unique concepts, like Uglydoll, introduced in 2001, with a number of recognizable characters and overarching style.

Modern plushies from Japan are known for &quot;kawaii&quot; styles, generally thought of as (at least globally) starting with Sanrio&#x27;s Hello Kitty, with many popular characters from popular media like Pikachu and Eevee from &quot;Pokémon&quot;, and characters from stationery company San-X including Rilakkuma and the characters. There is also a trend of Japanese plushies being shaped like mochi.

== Psychology ==

Children, as well as adults, can form connections with their stuffed toys, often sleeping or cuddling with them for comfort. They can be sentimental objects that reduce anxiety around separation, self-esteem, and fear of the night. In 2019 about a third of British adults reported sleeping with soft toys, and almost half had kept their childhood toys.

==Production==

Stuffed toys are made from a range of materials. The earliest were created from felt, velvet, or mohair and stuffed with straw, horsehair, or sawdust. Following World War II, manufacturers began to adopt more synthetic materials into production, and in 1954, the first teddy bear made from easily washable materials was produced. Modern stuffed toys are commonly constructed of outer fabrics such as plain cloth, pile textiles like plush or terrycloth, or sometimes socks. Common stuffing materials include synthetic fiber, batting, cotton, straw, wood wool, plastic pellets, and beans. Some modern toys incorporate technology to move and interact with the user.

Manufacturers sell two main types of stuffed toys: licensed, which are toys of characters or other licensed properties, or basic, which take the shape of ordinary animals or other non-licensed subjects.

Stuffed toys can also be homemade from numerous types of fabric or yarn. For instance, amigurumi is a traditional Japanese type of knitted or crocheted stuffed toy typically made with an oversized head and undersized extremities to look &quot;kawaii&quot; (&#x27;cute&#x27;).

== Cultural impact, marketing, and collectors ==

Stuffed toys are among the most popular toys, especially for children. Their uses include imaginative play, comfort objects, display or collecting, and gifts to both children and adults for occasions such as graduation, illness, condolences, Valentine&#x27;s Day, Christmas, or birthdays. In 2018, the global market for stuffed toys was estimated to be , with the growth in target consumers expected to drive sales upwards.

===Fads===

Many stuffed toys have become fads that have boosted the industry overall. Teddy bears were an early fad that quickly grew into a cultural phenomenon. Close to 100 years later, in the 1990s, Ty Warner created Beanie Babies, a series of animals stuffed with plastic pellets. The toys became a fad through marketing strategies that increased demand and encouraged collection. Pillow Pets, which can be folded from a pillow into a stuffed animal, were another successful brand, launching in 2003 and selling more than 30 million toys between 2010 and 2016.

Other recent fads have involved toys paired with technology. Tickle Me Elmo, a laughing and shaking plush toy based on the character Elmo from the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; television show, was released in 1996 and was soon in demand, with some people buying and reselling the toy for hundreds of dollars. This popularity sparked similar fads, including the robotic talking plush toy Furby released in 1998 and ZhuZhu Pets, a line of robotic plush hamsters released in 2009.

The Internet also presented an opportunity for new stuffed toy fads. In 2005, Ganz launched its Webkinz stuffed toys, which each came with a different &quot;Secret Code&quot; that gave access to the Webkinz World website and a virtual version of the toy for online play. Webkinz&#x27;s success inspired the creation of other stuffed toys containing codes to unlock digital content, such as the former online worlds Disney&#x27;s &quot;Club Penguin&quot; and Build-A-Bearville from Build-A-Bear Workshop. In 2013, Disney launched its first collection of Disney Tsum Tsum stuffed toys based on characters from different Disney properties. Inspired by the popular app of the same name, Tsum Tsums were first released in Japan (an example of mochi shaped plushies) before expanding to the United States. More recently, in 2021, Squishmallows have made an appearance as a popular Internet fad and collector&#x27;s item.

<text>The sheaf of rational functions &quot;KX&quot; of a scheme &quot;X&quot; is the generalization to scheme theory of the notion of function field of an algebraic variety in classical algebraic geometry. In the case of algebraic varieties, such a sheaf associates to each open set &quot;U&quot; the ring of all rational functions on that open set; in other words, &quot;KX&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) is the set of fractions of regular functions on &quot;U&quot;. Despite its name, &quot;KX&quot; does not always give a field for a general scheme &quot;X&quot;.

== Simple cases ==

In the simplest cases, the definition of &quot;KX&quot; is straightforward. If &quot;X&quot; is an (irreducible) affine algebraic variety, and if &quot;U&quot; is an open subset of &quot;X&quot;, then &quot;KX&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) will be the fraction field of the ring of regular functions on &quot;U&quot;. Because &quot;X&quot; is affine, the ring of regular functions on &quot;U&quot; will be a localization of the global sections of &quot;X&quot;, and consequently &quot;KX&quot; will be the constant sheaf whose value is the fraction field of the global sections of &quot;X&quot;.

If &quot;X&quot; is integral but not affine, then any non-empty affine open set will be dense in &quot;X&quot;. This means there is not enough room for a regular function to do anything interesting outside of &quot;U&quot;, and consequently the behavior of the rational functions on &quot;U&quot; should determine the behavior of the rational functions on &quot;X&quot;. In fact, the fraction fields of the rings of regular functions on any affine open set will be the same, so we define, for any &quot;U&quot;, &quot;KX&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) to be the common fraction field of any ring of regular functions on any open affine subset of &quot;X&quot;. Alternatively, one can define the function field in this case to be the local ring of the generic point.

== General case ==

The trouble starts when &quot;X&quot; is no longer integral. Then it is possible to have zero divisors in the ring of regular functions, and consequently the fraction field no longer exists. The naive solution is to replace the fraction field by the total quotient ring, that is, to invert every element that is not a zero divisor. Unfortunately, in general, the total quotient ring does not produce a presheaf much less a sheaf. The well-known article of Kleiman, listed in the bibliography, gives such an example.

The correct solution is to proceed as follows:

:For each open set &quot;U&quot;, let &quot;SU&quot; be the set of all elements in Γ(&quot;U&quot;, &quot;OX&quot;) that are not zero divisors in any stalk &quot;OX,x&quot;. Let &quot;KXpre&quot; be the presheaf whose sections on &quot;U&quot; are localizations &quot;SU−1&quot;Γ(&quot;U&quot;, &quot;OX&quot;) and whose restriction maps are induced from the restriction maps of &quot;OX&quot; by the universal property of localization. Then &quot;KX&quot; is the sheaf associated to the presheaf &quot;KXpre&quot;.

==Further issues==

Once &quot;KX&quot; is defined, it is possible to study properties of &quot;X&quot; which depend only on &quot;KX&quot;. This is the subject of birational geometry.

If &quot;X&quot; is an algebraic variety over a field &quot;k&quot;, then over each open set &quot;U&quot; we have a field extension &quot;KX&quot;(&quot;U&quot;) of &quot;k&quot;. The dimension of &quot;U&quot; will be equal to the transcendence degree of this field extension. All finite transcendence degree field extensions of &quot;k&quot; correspond to the rational function field of some variety.

In the particular case of an algebraic curve &quot;C&quot;, that is, dimension 1, it follows that any two non-constant functions &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; on &quot;C&quot; satisfy a polynomial equation &quot;P&quot;(&quot;F&quot;,&quot;G&quot;) = 0.

<text>Winchester Palace was a 12th-century bishop&#x27;s palace that served as the London townhouse of the Bishops of Winchester. It was located in the parish of Southwark in Surrey, on the south bank of the River Thames (opposite the City of London) on what is now Clink Street in the London Borough of Southwark, near St Saviour&#x27;s Church (which later became Southwark Cathedral). Grade II listed remains of the demolished palace survive on the site today, designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument, under the care of English Heritage.

==History==

Southwark in the county of Surrey was formerly the largest manor in the Diocese of Winchester and the Bishop of Winchester was a major landowner in the area. He was a great power in the land, and traditionally served as the king&#x27;s royal treasurer, performing the function of the modern Chancellor of the Exchequer. He thus frequently needed to attend the king both at his court in Westminster, at the Tower of London and also was required to attend Parliament with other bishops and major abbots. The city of Winchester had been the capital of the Saxon kings of England. For that purpose, Henry of Blois built the palace as his comfortable and high-status London residence. Most of the other English bishops similarly had episcopal palaces in London, most notably Lambeth Palace, residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury.
From 1682 to 1686 the palace was remodelled adding Corinthian columns and pilasters, to give a more contemporary Renaissance look the sculpture and masonry being by Edward Strong the Elder.
The palace remained in use until around 1700, when it was converted and divided into tenements and warehouses. These were mostly destroyed by fire in 1814. Part of the great hall, and the west gable end with its rose window became more visible after a 19th-century fire and 20th-century redevelopment. It is believed that the great hall was built in about 1136.

The hall was enlarged and the rose window built in the 14th century, possibly by Bishop William of Wykeham (reigned 1367–1398).

Below the hall was a richly decorated vaulted cellar with direct access to a wharf on the River Thames for bringing in supplies. Royal visitors were entertained at the palace, including King James I of Scotland on his wedding to Joan Beaufort (niece of the then bishop, Cardinal Henry Beaufort) in 1424. The palace was arranged around two courtyards. Other buildings within the site included a prison, a brewery and a butchery. The palace environs comprised a garden, a tennis court and a bowling alley.

During the Civil War Sir Thomas Ogle was imprisoned here, during which time he tried to draw Thomas Devenish, a member of John Goodwin&#x27;s Independent Congregation, into a royalist plot to split the Parliamentarian Independents from the Presbyterians in order to assist Charles I&#x27;s numbers in Parliament.

==The Clink Liberty==
Associated with the palace was the Liberty of the Clink which also lay on the south bank of the River Thames, an area free from the jurisdiction of the City of London. It therefore became an area where activities which were suppressed in the City could flourish openly. Thus gaming houses, bowling alleys, theatres and brothels abounded. It took its name from the notorious Clink prison which lay within the Liberty and gave rise to the slang expression &quot;in the clink&quot; (i.e. in prison). The Bishops of Winchester received rents from the numerous brothels, leading to the local prostitutes being known as &quot;Winchester geese&quot;.

==Present day==
The remains of Winchester Palace are listed as a Scheduled Monument and are managed by English Heritage.

<doc id="381305" wikidata="Q60308" url="?curid=381305" title="London Wall">
<text>The London Wall is a defensive wall first built by the Romans around the strategically important port town of Londinium in AD 200, as well as the name of a modern street in the City of London, England.

Roman London was, from around 120–150, protected by a large fort, with a large garrison, that stood to its north-western side. The fort, now referred to as the &quot;Cripplegate Fort&quot;, was later incorporated into a comprehensive city-wide defence, with its strengthened northern and western sides becoming part of the Wall which was built around 200. The incorporation of the fort&#x27;s walls gave the walled area its distinctive shape in the north-west part of the city.

The end of Roman rule in Britain, around 410, led to the wall falling into disrepair. It was restored in the late Anglo-Saxon period, a process generally thought to have begun under Alfred the Great after 886. Repairs and enhancements continued throughout the medieval period. The wall largely defined the boundaries of the City of London until the later Middle Ages, when population rises and the development of towns around the city blurred the perimeter.

From the 18th century onward, the expansion of the City of London saw large parts of the wall demolished, including its city gates, to improve traffic flow. Since the Second World War, conservation efforts have helped to preserve surviving sections of the city wall as scheduled monuments.

The long presence of the walls has had a profound and continuing effect on the character of the City of London, and surrounding areas. The walls constrained the growth of the city, and the location of the limited number of gates and the route of the roads through them shaped development within the walls, and more fundamentally, beyond them. With few exceptions, the modern roads heading into the former walled area are the same as those which passed through the former medieval gates.

==History==
===Roman London Wall===

It has origins as an initial mound wall and ditch from AD 100 and a fort, now called Cripplegate fort after the city gate (Cripplegate) that was subsequently built on its northern wall later on, in 120–150

The fort was later incorporated into a city-wide defence in the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD, though the reason for such a large and expensive fortification is unknown. The fort&#x27;s north and west walls were thickened and doubled in height to form part of the new city wall. The incorporation of the fort&#x27;s walls gave the walled area its distinctive shape in the north-west part of the city.

It continued to be developed until at least the end of the 4th century, making it among the last major building projects undertaken by the Romans before the Roman departure from Britain in 410. Reasons for its construction may have been connected to the invasion of northern Britain by Picts who overran Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in the 180s. This may be linked to the political crisis that emerged in the late 2nd century when the governor of Britain Clodius Albinus was consolidating his power after claiming the right of succession as Roman emperor. After a struggle with his rival Septimius Severus, Albinus was defeated in 197 at the Battle of Lugdunum (near Lyon, France). The economic stimulus provided by the wall and Septimius&#x27;s subsequent campaigns in Scotland improved Londinium&#x27;s financial prosperity in the early 3rd century.

====Roman London wall characteristics====
The wall&#x27;s gateways coincided with their alignment to the British network of Roman roads. The original gates, clockwise from Ludgate in the west to Aldgate in the east, were: Ludgate, Newgate, Cripplegate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. Aldersgate, between Newgate and Cripplegate, was added around 350. Moorgate, initially just a postern i.e. a secondary gate, was built later still, in the medieval period.

The length and size of the wall made it one of the biggest construction projects in Roman Britain. It had gateways, towers and defensive ditches, and was built from Kentish ragstone, which was brought by barge from quarries near Maidstone. It was long, enclosing an area of about . It was wide and up to high. The ditch or &quot;fossa&quot; in front of the outer wall was deep and up to wide. There were at least 22 towers spaced about apart on the eastern section of the wall.

====Roman Thamesside wall====
Excavation work has traced a significant development of of timber-framed waterfronts to the east and west of the modern site of London Bridge, with a piece of wooden bridge found at the end of Fish Street Hill. The constructions advancing around into the River Thames took place between the late 1st and mid-3rd centuries, highlighting that between these periods no wall stood against the river.

After Londinium was raided on several occasions by Saxon pirates in the late 3rd century, construction of an additional riverside wall, built in phases, began in 280 and was repaired 390. The existence of this riverside section was long doubted due to a lack of evidence, but excavations at the Tower of London in 1977 showed that the section of the inner curtain wall between the Lanthorne and Wakefield Towers, to the south of the White Tower, was originally the eastern part of the Roman riverside wall that was built or rebuilt in the late 4th century. The riverside wall may have limited access to the Thames, both commercial and otherwise, so it may have reflected a diminished level of activity within the city.

It is not clear how long the riverside wall survived, but there are references to a part of it near the dock of Queenhithe, in two charters of 889 and 898. There is currently no evidence of post-Roman restoration, so surviving sections are not likely to have been part, or an important part, of defences much after the Roman period.

====Post-Roman disrepair====
The end of Roman rule in Britain in 410 resulted in the wall slowly falling into disrepair, though the survival of Romano-British culture in the area is indicated by the settlement in the nearby St Martin-in-the-Fields area of Westminster, which persisted until around 450.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; notes that the Romano-British retreated back to London after their bloody defeat at the Battle of Crecganford (Crayford, Kent) at the hands of Hengist and Horsa, leaders of the Saxon invaders, in 457. This suggests that London&#x27;s walls retained some military value, although the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; was written many centuries after the Battle of Crayford took place, if it took place at all.

===Anglo-Saxon London Wall===

====Anglo-Saxon city revival====

From 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed in the same area slightly to the west of the abandoned Roman city, in the vicinity of the Strand.

In 886 the King of Wessex, Alfred the Great, formally agreed to the terms of the Danish warlord, Guthrum, concerning the area of political and geographical control that had been acquired by the incursion of the Vikings. Within the eastern and northern part of England, with its boundary roughly stretching from London to Chester, the Scandinavians would establish Danelaw.

====Anglo-Saxon London Wall restoration====
In the same year, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; recorded that London was &quot;refounded&quot; by Alfred. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. This was part Alfred&#x27;s policy of building an in-depth defence of the Kingdom of Wessex against the Vikings as well as creating an offensive strategy against the Vikings who controlled Mercia. The burh of Southwark was also created on the south bank of the River Thames during this time.

The city walls of London were repaired as the city slowly grew until about 950 when urban activity increased dramatically. A large Viking army that attacked the London burgh was defeated in 994.

===Medieval London Wall===

By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town in England. Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King William the Conqueror and his successors, was on its completion one of the longest churches in Europe. Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time on, London was the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: &quot;It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.&quot;

====Medieval London Wall restoration====
The size and importance of London led to the redevelopment of the city&#x27;s defences. During the early medieval period – following the Norman Conquest of England – the walls underwent substantial work that included crenellations, additional gates and further towers and bastions. Aside from the seven City Wall gates and the four bars, there are the 13 water-gates on the Thames where goods were unloaded from ships. These include Billingsgate and Bridge Gate. Additionally there were pedestrian-only gates such as the Tower Hill Postern at Tower Hill.

A further medieval defensive feature was the restoration of the defensive ditch immediately adjacent to the outside of the wall. The street name Houndsditch recalls a part of this former feature. This seems to have been re-cut in 1213, with the restored ditch being V-cut to a depth of 6 feet and a width of between 9 and 15 feet.

The re-cut of the ditch may have diverted some of the waters of the Walbrook which would otherwise have flowed through the city, and the wall itself does appear to have acted like a dam, partially obstructing the Walbrook and leading to the marshy conditions at the open space of Moorfields, just north of the wall.

As London continued to grow throughout the medieval period, urban development grew beyond the city walls. This expansion led to the suffix words &quot;Without&quot; and &quot;Within&quot; which denote whether an area of the City – and usually applied to the wards – fell outside or within the London Wall, though only Farringdon and (formerly) Bridge were split into separate wards this way (Bridge Without falling beyond the gates on London Bridge). Some wards – Aldersgate, Bishopsgate and Cripplegate – cover an area that was both within and outside the wall; although not split into separate wards, often the part (or &quot;division&quot;) within the Wall is denoted (on maps, in documents, etc.) as being &quot;within&quot; and the part outside the Wall as being &quot;without&quot;. Archaically &quot;infra&quot; (within) and &quot;extra&quot; (without) were also used and the terms &quot;intramural&quot; and &quot;extramural&quot; are also used to describe being within or outside the walled part of the city.

The suffix is applied to some churches and parishes near the city gateways, such as St Audoen within Newgate and St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate.

====Blackfriars extension====
Edward I gave the Dominican Friars (or Black Friars) permission to demolish and re-route the section of City wall between Ludgate and the Thames. They did this in stages between 1284 and 1320, extending the walled area as far as the River Fleet so that it enclosed their precinct. The westward extension is likely to have improved the defensibility of Ludgate.
==== The Wall and the developed area ====

In the medieval period the developed area of the city was largely confined to the City Wall, but there was extramural development, especially in the large western ward of Farringdon Without. The wall provided security but was a constraint to accessibility and growth. The extent of the city&#x27;s jurisdiction has changed little from 1000 to the modern day; but the extramural parts were long home to only a few people. A notable late change to the boundary appears to be that Stow&#x27;s Survey of London suggests that the part of Moorfields next to the wall was still, in 1603, outside the city&#x27;s jurisdiction.

The boundary of the city&#x27;s jurisdiction was marked by &quot;city bars&quot;, toll gates which were situated just beyond the old walled area; Holborn Bar, Temple Bar, West Smithfield Bar, and Whitechapel Bar. These were the important entrances to the city and their control was vital in maintaining the city&#x27;s special privileges over certain trades.

==== Great Fire of London ====
During the Great Fire of London in September 1666, almost all of the medieval City of London inside the wall was destroyed, but the wall and gates survived.

====Demolition====
The seven gates to the City of London, with many repairs and rebuilding over the years, stood until they were all demolished between 1760 and 1767. Work to demolish the walls continued into the 19th century; however, large sections of the wall were incorporated into other structures.

=== 20th century London Wall ===

==== Second World War ====

===== London Blitz =====
The Blitz during the Second World War, through the sheer scale of bombing and destruction of buildings and the surrounding landscape, revealed numerous parts of the London Wall.

At 00:15 on 28 August 1940, during the pre-wave of bombing before the Blitz, buildings and parts of the wall were destroyed between Fore Street and St. Alphage&#x27;s churchyard gardens around Cripplegate. This revealed parts of the wall unseen for over 300 years as the rubble of buildings destroyed around it were removed.

On 29 December 1940, heavy bombing led to conditions known as the Second Great Fire of London. Bomb damage revealed a section of wall at Noble Street, near the Museum of London.

==== Post-war loss ====
In 1957, a 64-metre section of the wall was uncovered during works on the London Wall road; the section was then destroyed to accommodate the road changes and to make way for a new car park. An 11-metre section has been preserved.

==== Conservation and heritage efforts ====
In 1984, the Museum of London set up a Wall Walk from the Tower of London to the museum, using 23 tiled panels. A number of these have been destroyed in subsequent years. At Noble Street, the panels were replaced by etched glass panels. These were intended as a prototype for new panels along the entire walk, but no further replacements have been made. One of the largest and most readily accessed fragments of the wall stands just outside Tower Hill tube station, with a replica statue of the Emperor Trajan standing in front of it. There is a further surviving section preserved in the basement of the One America Square building. There are further remains in the basement of the Old Bailey.

=== Impact on current city ===

The layout of the Roman and medieval walls have had a profound effect on the development of London, even down to the present day. The walls constrained the growth of the city, and the location of the limited number of gates and the route of the roads through them shaped development within the walls, and in a much more fundamental way, beyond them. With a few exceptions, the parts of the modern road network heading into the former walled area are the same as those which passed through the former medieval gates.

Part of the route originally taken by the northern wall is commemorated, although now only loosely followed, by the road also named London Wall. The modern road starts in the west with the Rotunda junction at Aldersgate, then runs east past Moorgate, from which point it runs parallel to the line of the City Wall, and eventually becomes Wormwood Street before it reaches Bishopsgate. This alignment, however, is the result of rebuilding between 1957 and 1976. Before this, London Wall was narrower, and ran behind the line of the City Wall for its entire length, from Wormwood Street to Wood Street. The western section is now St Alphage Garden.

== Course ==

=== Eastern wall section ===

==== Tower of London ====

The eastern section of the wall starts in what is now the Tower of London. Within the grounds of the Tower remains of the eastern most wall can still be seen along with a line in the paths heading North within the Tower grounds to outline where it used to run before most of it was demolished to expand the fortification of the Tower. This followed on with a junction at the Tower of London&#x27;s moat to the Tower Hill Postern, Gate 1, a medieval fortified entrance. The foundation to this entrance can still be seen today within the Tower Hill pedestrian subway. Other large sections of the wall can also be seen further ahead within the Tower Hill gardens.

==== Aldgate ====
The wall from Tower Hill then runs east of Walbrook toward the second historic gate, Aldgate – Gate 2. These would have led onto the Roman road network toward Essex and East Anglia via Stratford and Colchester. In present times the roads Leadenhall Street and Fenchurch Street lead into Aldgate High Street, where the gate&#x27;s foundations are buried roughly where the Jewry Street intersects. Following the wall north, it runs between what is now The Aldgate School and Aldgate Square.

==== Bishopsgate ====
From Aldgate, the wall then ran North-West toward Gate 3, Bishopsgate. The road through this would have led onto the Roman road network toward leading to Lincoln and York. The current road, the A10 going north, now goes over the foundations of this gate.

=== Northern wall section ===

==== Moorgate ====
From Bishopsgate going along the northern section of wall leads to Gate 4; Moorgate. Until 1415 this was a small postern leading into the marshy Moorfields area of Finsbury. The wet conditions were probably caused by the wall partially obstructing the flow of the Walbrook. Moorgate remained ill-connected with no direct approach road from the south until 1846, some time after the wall had been demolished. London Wall, the modern road following this section of the wall, now crosses this gate&#x27;s foundations. Leading north from here are routes into Finsbury.

==== Cripplegate ====
Route to the London Charterhouse, Clerkenwell and Islington.

==== Aldersgate ====
With direct access to more local routes.

=== Western wall section ===

==== Newgate ====
High Holborn and Oxford Street, with access via the Devil&#x27;s Highway to Silchester and Bath, and Watling Street to St Albans and the west midlands. These roads leading over the River Fleet.

==== Ludgate ====
Fleet Street and the Strand

== Bastions ==
The bastions, towers built against the face of the city wall, are scattered irregularly across its perimeter. Not bonded to the city wall itself, they are considered to be added after the construction of the wall and even later after by post-Roman builders.

21 bastions are currently known about (more may be undiscovered). They can be grouped into:
* an eastern section from the Tower of London to Bishopsgate (B1–10),
* a single bastion west of Bishopsgate (B11), and
* a western section (B12–21). Between the eastern and western section, a gap of 731 metres (2400 feet or 800 yards) along the northern section of the city wall has no recorded bastions.

<text>Fussball Club Basel 1893, widely known as FC Basel, FCB, or just Basel, is a Swiss professional football club based in Basel, in the Canton of Basel-Stadt. Formed in 1893, the club has been Swiss national champions 20 times, Swiss Cup winners 13 times, and Swiss League Cup winners once.

Basel competed in UEFA competitions for 25 consecutive seasons between 1999–2000 and 2023–2024. They have qualified for the Group stages of the Champions League more times than any other Swiss club – a total of seven times – and are the only Swiss club to have ever qualified to the Group stages directly. In 2021, they set the new record for a Swiss team with the most successful international group stage campaign by reaching 14 points in their Conference League group. Since 2001, the club has played its home games at St. Jakob-Park, built on the site of their previous home, St. Jakob Stadium. Their home colours are red and blue, leading to a nickname of &quot;RotBlau&quot;.

==History==


===The early years===
FC Basel was started by an advertisement placed by Roland Geldner in the 12 November 1893 edition of the &quot;Basler&quot; national newspaper, requesting that a football team be formed and that anyone who wished to join should meet up the following Wednesday at 8:15 in the restaurant Schuhmachern-Zunft. Eleven men attended the meeting, generally from the academic community, founding Fussball Club Basel on 15 November 1893. The club colours from the first day on were red and blue.

Basel&#x27;s first game was on 26 November 1893, an internal match between two &quot;ad hoc&quot; FCB teams. Two weeks later, FCB had their first official appearance in a game against a team formed by students from the high school gymnastic club. FCB won 2–0. Basel continued to only play friendly matches, until they joined the second Serie A championship organized by the Swiss Football Association. The Serie A was divided into three regional groups, an east, a central (with FCB) and a west group. The winners of each group qualified for the finals. Basel did not qualify for the finals and they did not compete in the championship the following season.

The Serie A 1900–01 was divided into two groups, an east and a west group. Basel were with three teams from Zürich and two other teams from Basel, Old Boys and Fortuna Basel in the west group. Basel ended the season with two victories, two draws and six defeats in 5th position in the group. Basel did not have much of an early footballing success, waiting 40 years before winning their first trophy.

Gyula Kertész coached the side from 1928 to 1930. At the beginning of the 1932–33 season, the Austrian ex-international footballer Karl Kurz took over as club trainer. There were eight teams in Group 1 of the 1932–33 Nationalliga. Basel finished the season in second position in the table, with seven victories from 14 games. The play-off game between the second placed teams from both groups was held in Basel at the Stadion Rankhof, but the home team lost 3–4 to Servette FC Genève. In the Swiss Cup, Basel advanced to the final, which was played in the Hardturm in Zürich. Basel won 4–3 and thus their first ever national title, defeating arch-rivals and reigning cup-holders Grasshoppers in what is still considered to be one of the best cup finals in Swiss football history.

During the following five seasons, Basel were positioned towards the middle of the Nationliga, not having much to do with the championship not having to worry about relegation. But the 1938–39 Nationalliga did not mean well with them. With just five wins and with twelve defeats, they finished in the last position in the league table and were relegated.

The 1941–42 season was Basel&#x27;s third season in the 1st League (second flight of Swiss football) after relegation. Eugen Rupf was player-coach for his second year. Basel finished their season as winners of group East. In the play-offs against group West winners Bern, the away tie ending with a goalless draw and Basel won their home tie 3–1 to achieve Promotion. In the Swiss Cup five home games, a coin toss in the quarter-final and a replay in the semi-final was needed to qualify for the final. The final against Grasshoppers ended goalless after extra time and a replay was required here too. In the replay – played at the Wankdorf Stadion against the Nationalliga champions – Basel led at half-time through two goals by Fritz Schmidlin, but two goals from Grubenmann a third from Neukom gave Grasshoppers a 3–2 victory.

After just three seasons in the top flight of Swiss football, Basel suffered relegation again, but achieved immediate re-promotion in the 1944–45 season.

Anton Schall, another Austrian ex-international, became the club&#x27;s new trainer. Basel finished the Nationalliga A season in fourth position, with 12 victories from 26 games, scoring a total of 60 goals; top league goal scorers were Traugott Oberer (13) and René Bader (10). Basel won the cup for the second time as they beat Lausanne Sports (who had also been runners-up the previous year) 3–0 in the final at the Stadion Neufeld in Bern. Paul Stöcklin scored two goals and Bader scored the other one.

At the beginning of the 1952–53 season, René Bader took over the job as club trainer from Ernst Hufschmid, who had acted as trainer the previous five years. Bader acted as player-manager and Willy Dürr was his assistant; Dürr stood at the side line when Bader played. Basel won their first league title in 1953 and ended the season four points ahead of BSC Young Boys. Basel won 17 of the 26 games, losing only once, and they scored 72 goals conceding 38. Josef Hügi was the team&#x27;s top league goal scorer.

The Czechoslovakian manager Jiří Sobotka was the club manager at this time, he taken the job over from Jenő Vincze the year before. Basel finished the championship in sixth position. Heinz Blumer was Basel&#x27;s top scorer this season with 16 goals, Karl Odermatt their second best goal scorer with 14. The Wankdorf Stadium hosted the Swiss Cup final on 15 April 1963, and Basel played against favourites Grasshoppers. Two goals after half-time, one by Heinz Blumer and the second from Otto Ludwig, gave Basel a 2–0 victory and their third Cup win in their history. Peter Füri played in all games save the final due to an illness.

On 26 December 1964 FCB played against Grasshoppers Zürich in the quarter-finals of the Swiss Cup. They decided the match 3–1 for themselves in overtime. This was to be the last match for the popular Basler captain of that time Hans Weber, because just seven weeks later he died of cancer. Between his first appearance in 1949 and his death in February 1965 he made 281 appearances for Basel scoring 48 goals.

===Rise and fall===
In the 1966–67 season, Benthaus achieved his first league win with Basel. During this season, he acted as player-manager, having taken over the trainer job from Jiří Sobotka at the beginning of the previous season. There were 14 teams contesting in the championship, and Basel finished just one point clear of FC Zürich. Basel won 16 of the 26 games, drawing eight, losing only twice and they scored 60 goals conceding just 20. Roberto Frigerio was the team&#x27;s top goal scorer with 16 league goals, while Helmut Hauser was second-best with 14.

In the Swiss Cup final that season, Basel&#x27;s opponents were Lausanne-Sports. In the former Wankdorf Stadium on 15 May 1967, Helmut Hauser scored the decisive goal via a penalty. The game went down in football history due to the sit-down strike that followed this goal. After 88 minutes of play, with the score at 1–1, referee Karl Göppel awarded Basel a controversial penalty: André Grobéty had pushed Hauser gently in the back and he let himself drop theatrically. Subsequent to Basel taking the lead, Lausanne players refused to resume the game, sitting down demonstratively on the pitch. The referee was forced to abandon the match and Basel were awarded the cup with a 3–0 default victory.

Basel had won the double for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.

The league title in 1966–67 led to Basel qualifying to play in the European Cup for the first time, in 1967–68. Basel, however, were knocked out of the tournament in the First Round by Danish side Akademisk Boldklub.

Basel&#x27;s next league title was achieved in the 1968–69 Nationalliga A season as they once again finished just one point above the runners-up, this time Lausanne Sports. In the Swiss Cup, Basel reached the quarter-finals. This championship title meant that Basel could embark on another European adventure, but again they failed to overcome the first hurdle; this time it was Celtic of Scotland. Nationally in the 1969–70 season, Basel won the league for the fourth time again one point ahead of Lausanne Sports. In the Swiss Cup, Basel reached the final.

The European Cup was a little kinder to Basel in 1970–71, as they reached the Second Round, losing to Ajax after defeating Soviets Spartak Moscow in the first round. Basel did not retain their title the following season despite finishing with the same number of points as the subsequent champions, Grasshoppers, who won the title on a head-to-head. In the Swiss Cup, Basel reached the quarter-finals.

After a trophy-less season, Basel again won two league titles in-a-row. The 1971–72 season was the last season for Helmut Benthaus as an active footballer. Basel won the championship four points ahead of Zürich. In 
the Swiss Cup, Basel reached the final but were defeated 0–1 by Zürich through a goal in extra time. In the 1971–72 UEFA Cup, Basel were drawn against Real Madrid. The home game attracted 32,059 spectators, but Basel were defeated 1–2 and lost overall 2–4 on aggregate.

The 1972–73 season was Benthaus&#x27; eighth season as manager. Basel won 17 of their 26 league games and won the championship four points ahead of Grasshoppers. Ottmar Hitzfeld was the league&#x27;s joint top goal scorer with 18 league goals. In the Swiss Cup, Basel played Martigny-Sports, Young Boys, FC Chiasso and FC Biel-Bienne to reach the final against Zürich. The 1972 Swiss League Cup was the inaugural Swiss League Cup competition. It was played in the summer of 1972 as a pre-season tournament to the 1972–73 season. This was won by Basel who defeated FC Winterthur 4–1 in the final in which Hitzfeld scored a hattick. In Europe, Basel failed to impress once again, in 1972–73, as they were sent crashing out at the first stage by Hungary&#x27;s Újpesti Dózsa SC.

But in the 1973–74 season, they excelled with the Peruvian legend Teófilo Cubillas in their ranks, eliminating Icelanders Fram Reykjavík and Club Brugge of Belgium, before narrowly exiting in the quarter-finals to Celtic 5–6 on aggregate after extra time in the away leg. In the 1973–74 Nationalliga A season Basel finished in just 5th position winning 13 of their 26 league games, drawing twice and suffering 10 defeats, gaining 29 points. They finished 16 points behind the new champions Zürich. Ottmar Hitzfeld was the teamst top goal scorer with 19 league goals. He ended the Swiss ranking in third position behind Daniel Jeandupeux (Zürich, 22 goals) and Walter Müller (Lausanne-Sports, 21 goals). In the Swiss Cup Basel proceeded to the quarter-finals, in which they played against Sion. Sion won the two legged round 3–2 on aggregate.

Despite Basel&#x27;s improvement on the European stage, they did not retain the league for another four years. At the end of the 1974–75 Nationalliga A season Basel finished in fourth position (11 wins, 9 draws, 2 defeats, 49–33 goals) 8 points adrift of FC Zürich who won the championship for the second time in a row. In the League Cup Basel reached the semi-finals. But they did manage to lift the Swiss Cup in 1975, beating Winterthur 2–1 in the Final after extra time and therefore qualifying for the 1975–76 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

Basel&#x27;s long-awaited title-win came in 1977 as they triumphed over Servette FC in a playoff. This meant that Basel returned to play in the European Cup, but they were defeated in the first round, once more, by Wacker Innsbruck of Austria, after showing so much promise on their last European outing. After the success of the 1976–77 season, Basel endured two seasons of below-par performances and mid-table finishes until glory returned in 1980, as Basel won the Nationalliga A title through the playoff. However, manager Helmut Benthaus left in 1982 and in the following seasons, Basel&#x27;s final league positions started to drop until their relegation into the Nationalliga B in 1988.

Several managers came and went at the St. Jakob Stadium between then, until Basel finally returned to the Nationalliga A in 1994 under Claude Andrey. Basel avoided relegation by three points in their first season back at the top-flight, but Andrey left and was replaced by Karl Engel. Engel led Basel to a fifth-place finish in his first season in charge and a solid mid-table finish in 1997, but he was sacked after a poor start to the 1997–98 campaign, in which Basel finished second-last. Jörg Berger then took over but lasted only a year in charge before Christian Gross was appointed. Gross&#x27; appointment went hand-in-hand with the financial backing that had just been put into the club and it was not long until Basel returned to the top.

===Return of the glory days===
The St. Jakob-Park was opened on 15 March 2001, and Basel finished the 2000–01 season in fourth position in the league. Basel ended the qualification round of 2001–02 leading the league table by five points at the winter break. The Championship round began in February and with ten wins and just one defeat in the first 11 games, Basel pulled away at the top of the table to win the championship three games before the end of the season, their first title for 22 years. They went on to complete a domestic double, beating Grasshoppers in extra time in the Swiss Cup thanks to a penalty scored by Murat Yakin. Basel also reached the final of the UEFA Intertoto Cup.

In the 2002–03 season, Basel became the second Swiss team to play in the revamped UEFA Champions League. They reached the second group round, but were knocked out on goal difference in a group containing Manchester United, Juventus, and Deportivo de La Coruña. In domestic competitions, Basel finished second in the Swiss Super League and won the Swiss Cup after beating Neuchâtel Xamax 6–0 in the final.

Basel started 2003–04 with 13 straight league wins, and went on to complete the first half of the season undefeated, with 17 wins and 1 draw. Basel remained top of the league for the rest of the season, winning their 10th Swiss championship. In the UEFA Cup they were eliminated by Newcastle United in the second round after defeating Malatyaspor in the previous round.

As Swiss champions, Basel entered the 2004–05 Champions League in the third qualifying round. They were drawn against Internazionale, who beat them 5–2 on aggregate, dropping Basel into the UEFA Cup. After beating Russian side Terek Grozny in the third round they were drawn in Group E with Feyenoord, Schalke 04, Ferencváros and Hearts. They finished third in the group on seven points and qualified for the Round of 32, where they were defeated 2–0 on aggregate by Lille. In the domestic league, after a poor start, Basel moved to the top of the league table and went on to win the title by ten points. Basel completed their 17 home league games undefeated, winning 13 and drawing four, including an 8–1 win against Grasshoppers, in which Christian Giménez scored four goals.

Basel were knocked out of the 2005–06 Champions League in the third qualifying round by German club Werder Bremen. They again dropped into the UEFA Cup, where they beat Široki Brijeg of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be drawn into Group E alongside Strasbourg, Roma, Red Star Belgrade and Tromsø. They finished third in the group, qualifying for the knockout stage. After beating Monaco and Strasbourg once again, they were eliminated by Middlesbrough in the quarter final. On 26 February 2006, Basel broke their own club record of 52 unbeaten league games at home, which they extended to 59. The winning streak was ended on the final day of the season with a last-minute goal by Iulian Filipescu giving FC Zürich a 2–1 win and, in the process, Zürich&#x27;s first national championship since 1980–81. This resulted in riots between rival supporters after the match.

In 2006–07 Basel were again runners-up to Zürich in the league, and won the Swiss Cup for the eight time, beating FC Luzern 1–0 in the final. In the 2006–07 UEFA Cup Basel beat Kazakh side Tobol, Liechtensteiner team FC Vaduz, and Macedonians FK Rabotnički. to qualify for the group stages. Drawn against Blackburn Rovers, Nancy, Feyenoord and Wisła Kraków, Basel finished bottom of the group and were eliminated.

===Recent years===
Basel were drawn against Bosnian team FK Sarajevo in the first qualifying round of the UEFA Cup, a tie that Basel won 8–1 on aggregate. In the next round, Basel faced a considerably tougher opponent in the form of SV Mattersburg of Austria. Nonetheless, Basel finished the tie off with a 4–0 away win after a 2–1 victory at St. Jakob-Park. Basel were then drawn into the group of death of Group D alongside Brann, Dinamo Zagreb, Hamburger SV and Rennes, all of which were ranked within the top three of their own leagues at the start of the stage. Basel won their first UEFA Cup group game against Rennes at home 1–0 thanks to a Marco Streller header. Their next game was away to Dinamo Zagreb in which Basel earned a valuable away point thanks to on form goalkeeper Franco Costanzo, who kept the game at 0–0 for 90 minutes. They then faced Brann at St. Jakob-Park, where they won 1–0 through a Carlitos free-kick and were highly praised for playing attractive and flowing football. Basel then went to Germany to face Hamburger SV at the HSH Nordbank Arena, where they were fortunate to escape with a 1–1 draw. The goals came courtesy of captain Ivan Ergić and Hamburg&#x27;s Ivica Olić.

Basel then faced Sporting CP in the last 32 after qualifying second in the group alongside first-placed Hamburg and third-placed Brann. (Sporting finished third in their group in the Champions League, which is why they were dropped into the UEFA Cup.) The first leg took place on 13 February in Lisbon, where first-choice goalkeeper Franco Costanzo was injured and Basel lost 2–0. The second leg did not fare any better for Basel. Costanzo remained injured and Basel lost 3–0 on 21 February in Basel, falling from the UEFA Cup.

Basel won the Swiss Cup for the second consecutive season after beating second-tier side AC Bellinzona 4–1 at St. Jakob-Park on 6 April 2008. Eren Derdiyok gave Basel the lead in the first half before Bellinzona equalised through Christian Pouga in the second. Daniel Majstorović restored the lead for Basel with a header and Swiss internationals Marco Streller and Benjamin Huggel scored one goal each to make the final scoreline 4–1 in Basel&#x27;s favour.

Basel won the Swiss Super League for the first time since 2005 on 10 May 2008 at home after a 2–0 win over title threats BSC Young Boys. It was the last game of the season and Basel only needed a point from the match to win the Championship, but if Young Boys won, then they would be champions, exactly the same situation as the end of the 2005–06 season with FC Zürich. The painful memories of losing the league on the last day of the season in 2006 seemed to spur FCB on as they took an early lead through Valentin Stocker before Marco Streller wrapped up the victory with the second.

In 2008–09 season, Basel entered the Champions League in the Second Qualifying Round and were drawn against IFK Göteborg of Sweden. The first leg was on 30 July 2008 at Ullevi and finished 1–1. Benjamin Huggel put Basel ahead before Thomas Olsson equalised for the home team. The second leg took place on 6 August at St. Jakob-Park, with Basel coming from behind twice to win 4–2. Basel then faced Vitória de Guimarães of Portugal in the Third Qualifying Round. The first leg at the Estádio D. Afonso Henriques on 13 August ended in a 0–0 draw. The second leg took place on 27 August at St. Jakob-Park, where Valentin Stocker gave Basel an early lead on 11 minutes before João Alves was fouled in the penalty area by François Marque and João Fajardo dispatched the spot-kick, just four minutes later to draw Vitória level. In the second half, the away side started well but Eren Derdiyok gave FCB a 2–1 lead which they hung on to, to qualify for the Champions League Group stages. FCB were drawn into Group C alongside Barcelona, Shakhtar Donetsk and Sporting CP. Basel lost their opening game 2–1 at St. Jakob-Park on 16 September against Shakhtar. Fernandinho put the Ukrainians ahead on 25 minutes before Jádson doubled their lead just before half time. David Abraham scored a late consolation goal for the home team. Sporting CP were the opponents on Matchday 2 (1 October) and despite defending well and causing a few scares at the other end of the park, Basel were defeated 2–0 at the Estádio José Alvalade. On Matchday 3 (22 October), Barcelona visited Basel and came away with a 5–0 win, but a fortnight later it was a different story as FCB came away with a respectable 1–1 draw at the Camp Nou, with Eren Derdiyok scoring a late equaliser after Lionel Messi put &quot;Barça&quot; ahead. On 26 November, Basel travelled to Ukraine to play Shakhtar, where they were thrashed 5–0. Basel then faced Sporting at home on the final Matchday (9 December) and were defeated 1–0.

Despite remaining in first or second position for most of the season, Basel finished in third place behind FC Zürich and Young Boys. On 27 May, Christian Gross was sacked from his role as FC Basel manager after ten years in the job.

They qualified for the group stage and were drawn into Group E alongside Roma, Fulham and CSKA Sofia. Basel finished in third place.

In domestic affairs, Basel s won the title on the last day of the season against favourites Young Boys at the Stade de Suisse. Marco Streller was the league&#x27;s top scorer with 21 goals. Basel won the 2009–10 Swiss Cup final with a 6–0 victory over FC Lausanne-Sport, FC Basel&#x27;s tenth cup win.

In 2010–11 season, Basel entered the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League in the third qualifying round, drawn against Debrecen; they won both games (2–0, 3–1). In the play-offs to the Champions League, they are drawn against Sheriff Tiraspol. In the first leg, they defeated Tiraspol 1–0 before winning 3–0 on the road. Basel entered the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League group stage in Group E.

On 13 October 2011, Thorsten Fink left the club to join Hamburger SV. As replacement, his assistant Vogel was signed as caretaker manager until the winter break. Basel historically qualified for the knockout phase of the Champions League with 2–1 win over Manchester United on 7 December 2011. On 12 December, it was announced that Vogel had signed as head coach and manager. On 22 February 2012, Basel defeated Bayern Munich in the first leg of the Round of 16 stage in the Champions League. They won with a score of 1–0, scoring in the 86th minute of the game, but then lost in the return leg 7–0, thus eliminating them.

On 15 October 2012, manager Heiko Vogel was sacked by the club and replaced by former player Murat Yakin. At the end of the first half of the season, Basel were in second position in the domestic league table. In the second half of the season, Basel acquired enough points to finish the season three points ahead of Grasshoppers and to win their fourth title in a row.

As Swiss champions, Basel entered the Champions League in the second qualifying round, where they were drawn against Estonian club Flora Tallinn, winning 5–0 on aggregate. In the third round, they were drawn against Norwegian club Molde, winning 2–1 on aggregate.

In the knockout phase round of 32, Basel were drawn against Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Basel won 3–1 on aggregate. In the round of 16, they were drawn against Zenit Saint Petersburg and, despite being the underdogs, they qualified for the quarter-finals by winning 2–1 on aggregate. Here Basel were drawn against Tottenham Hotspur, which they beat 4–1 on penalties after a 4–4 aggregate draw to progress to the semi-finals. The draw for the semi-final matched them against reigning Champions League holders Chelsea. Both games in the tie ended with a defeat, 1–2 in Basel 1–3 in London.

Basel&#x27;s 2013–14 UEFA Champions League season started on 30 July 2013 in the third qualifying round with a tie in St. Jakob-Park against Maccabi Tel Aviv, which they won 4–3 on aggregate. In the first match of the main group stage, Basel notched up a surprising 2–1 away win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and followed this up with a 1–0 home win in the return fixture at St. Jakob-Park. Despite these two results, they only finished in third position in the league table and thus they qualified for the 2013–14 Europa League round of 32. There, they fought Israeli team Maccabi Tel Aviv and went on to defeat Red Bull Salzburg 2–1 on aggregate. They would face Valencia in the quarter-finals, winning 3–0 at home, but losing 0–5 in Valencia after extra-time.

On 28 May 2014, Basel announced that Paulo Sousa was to become their trainer for the new season and that he had signed a three-year contract. They went on to win the league championship for the sixth time in a row. In the Swiss Cup, Basel ended as runners-up, losing 0–3 to FC Sion in the final.

Paulo Sousa left the club prior to the 2015–16 season for Fiorentina; he was replaced by FC Thun head coach Urs Fischer on 18 June.

Basel entered into the 2015–16 Champions League season in the Third qualifying round. Their initial aim was to remain in the competition and reach the group stage. In the third qualifying round, they were drawn against Lech Poznań and in the play-off round against Maccabi Tel Aviv. Basel failed to qualify for the Champions League group stage, thus they dropped into the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League group stage. Here they were drawn into Group I, together with Fiorentina, Lech Poznań and Belenenses. Because they finished as group winners, Basel continued in the knockout phase in February 2016. Basel were drawn against French side Saint-Étienne. They advanced on away goals after a 4–4 aggregate draw with Saint-Étienne. They were knocked out of the tournament by the eventual winners, Sevilla, 3–0 in the round of 16.

On 30 April 2016, Basel confirmed a seventh consecutive Swiss national championship with a 2–1 win over FC Sion at St. Jakob-Park. At the end of the season Basel won the title 14 points ahead of Young Boys.

Basel entered into the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League in the Group stage. Drawn against French champions Paris Saint-Germain, English team Arsenal and Bulgarian champions Ludogorets Razgrad they finished bottom of the group and were eliminated.

Basel won the Swiss Super League for the eighth time in a row – the club&#x27;s 20th championship title in total. They also won the Swiss Cup for the twelfth time, completing a sixth double.

In 2017–18 season, Raphaël Wicky was appointed as new first team manager, assisted by Massimo Lombardo. The club&#x27;s eight-year monopoly over the Swiss league title ended in 2018, as BSC Young Boys won the domestic championship. Basel finished second on 69 points, while Young Boys romped to the title, winning the league by a 15-point margin.

Later on, Basel reached the quarter-finals of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League for the third time after 2012–13 and 2013–14.

==Supporters and rivalries==

===Fans===

FC Basel is known for having a big and loyal local following. When polls are conducted about the most passionate club football fans, FC Basel&#x27;s fans usually make the top 200 if not top 100 in the world, resulting in what is by far the highest average attendance in Switzerland with around 30,000 fans attending every home game and with the new extension being built that number is expected to rise to around 40,000. The fans have also made themselves a name in numerous international matches in recent years. World tennis legend Roger Federer is one of the club&#x27;s most famous fans.

In November 2010 their supporters caused the game against FC Luzern to be stopped after they threw hundreds of tennis balls onto the pitch. This was in protest at the kick off times being moved to accommodate a tennis tournament on the TV schedule.

===Rivalry===
The city of Basel and the city of Zürich have a long-standing rivalry. Therefore, FCB&#x27;s most traditional and fiercest rivals are Grasshopper Club Zürich and FC Zürich. In the past few seasons, the rivalry between FC Zürich and Basel has been fueled by Zürich&#x27;s narrow league championship wins over Basel. Supporters from both sides have caused trouble in the past years, with the worst incident happening in May 2006. Basel had won the league in 2003–04 and 2004–05 and were set to make it three in a row if they won or drew against Zürich at home on the last day of the 2005–06 season. Zürich took the lead after a late goal from Iulian Filipescu and consequently won the match and the league. After the final whistle, players and fans from both teams started fighting on the pitch and in the stands. This incident has fueled hatred and bitterness between fans from FC Zürich and FC Basel. There is controversy about which rivalry is bigger, the one with Grasshopper or FC Zürich, but it usually depends on the success of these teams.

==Stadium==

FC Basel play their home games at the 37,500 capacity St. Jakob-Park.

UEFA have awarded the stadium a 4-star rating, the highest rating that could be given to a stadium of that capacity. St. Jakob-Park was opened in 2001, originally holding a maximum attendance of 33,433. The stadium was expanded with a new stand (sector G) and upgraded to 42,500 due to Switzerland co-hosting UEFA Euro 2008. After Euro 2008, a number of seats were removed, thus giving more space between them, and the capacity was reduced 37,500 seats. The stadium is nicknamed &quot;Joggeli&quot; by the fans and has two restaurants, Restaurant UNO and Hattrick&#x27;s Sports Bar, as well as a shopping centre which opened on 1 November 2001. It also has parking space for 680 cars and has its own train station. St. Jakob-Park hosted six matches during Euro 2008, including the opening game between Switzerland and Czech Republic, and a semi-final between Germany and Turkey. The most interesting feature of the stadium is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colours for impressive effects; this effect was copied three years later for Bayern Munich&#x27;s new stadium, the Allianz Arena.

Before St. Jakob-Park was built, FC Basel played home games in the Landhof (in the Quarter Kleinbasel) and, following the 1954 FIFA World Cup, in the newly built St. Jakob Stadium which was on the same site as the current stadium. During the construction period of St. Jakob-Park, Basel&#x27;s home matches were played at the Stadion Schützenmatte.

In 2016, the UEFA Europa League final was played at St. Jakob-Park.

==Affiliated clubs==
* FC Concordia Basel – FC Basel are the parent-club of local side Concordia, who currently play in the 1. Liga Classic. Many of Basel&#x27;s youth players, such as Patrik Baumann, Beg Ferati, and Simone Grippo, have had loan spells there. Basel have also signed a number players from Concordia, like Louis Crayton and Murat Yakin. Miroslav König, Riccardo Meili, André Muff, and Dominik Ritter are just a few ex-Basel players who have gone on to play for Concordia.

==Colours and logo==
FC Basel&#x27;s traditional kit is a red and blue shirt. Due to the fact that some of the founders were members of the &quot;Basler Ruder-Club&quot;, whose colors were red and blue, they adopted those colours for their new club. FC Basel&#x27;s outfit is completed by blue shorts with gold trim and blue socks with red trim. From this comes the nickname &quot;RotBlau&quot; which is Swiss German and German for &quot;RedBlue&quot;. Their away kit is all white with two stripes down the middle, the left being red and the right being blue. FC Basel&#x27;s kits were formerly manufactured by Nike, however in the summer of 2012 a new contract was formed with Adidas to produce the kits until 2017. The main sponsor is Novartis, a multinational pharmaceutical company which is based in the city of Basel. On the inside tag of the jerseys is inscribed &quot;Rot isch unseri Liebi, Blau die ewigi Treui, Basel unseri Stadt.&quot; This roughly translates to &quot;Red is our love, blue the eternal loyalty, Basel our city.&quot;

According to a legend, the famous &quot;Blaugrana&quot; colours of Barcelona have been said to have originated from the Rotblau colours of FC Basel. This legend evolved because Joan Gamper, founder of both FC Zürich and FC Barcelona had played two friendly games for FC Basel against Mulhouse and Strasbourg on short visits, as he did for other Swiss clubs, too. FC Barcelona today based on accounts of the Gamper family assumes, the colours had been taken from the rugby team of the Merchant Taylors&#x27; School near Liverpool.

For the 2008–09 season, Basel changed their shirt to resemble the traditional Barcelona shirt (red and blue vertical stripes). Barcelona changed theirs to one half of the shirt red, the other blue, which happens to resemble the traditional Basel shirt.
Basel&#x27;s current logo is a shield, the left half red and the right half blue. The shield is outlined with gold and in the centre in gold letters it reads &quot;FCB&quot;, for &quot;Football Club Basel&quot; or &quot;Fussballclub Basel&quot;. The logo is worn in the centre of the shirt opposed to on the traditional left-hand side. Like the club colours of Basel, the logo has a striking resemblance to that of Barcelona&#x27;s. There are theories that suggest that the founder of Barcelona, being at one time the captain of Basel, reincorporated the logo of Basel to that of Barcelona. The resemblances seem clear: both logos seem to incorporate the shield design, as do most other clubs. Most notably, however, is the FCB acronyms on both logos and the red-blue colours, outlined in gold. Additionally, the football that lies on the left side of the Basel logo seems to be the exact shape, type and colour as that of the Barcelona logo in the bottom centre. Because of this, many say that Basel was the inspiration in the process of founding Barcelona.

==Players==
=== Current squad ===











====Players out on loan====





====Retired numbers====



===Women&#x27;s team===

Since 2009 Basel have a women&#x27;s team. It competes in the Nationalliga A.

===Superleague Formula===

FC Basel had a team in the Superleague Formula race car series where football teams lent their name to cars. GU-Racing International has operated the car for all seasons and Max Wissel has driven the car in all the races. FC Basel and Wissel won one race, in the 2009 season at Donington Park. The team have scored three other podiums in the series.

==Youth system==
Basel is home to a leading youth academy system in terms of produced senior-level players that featured in the top-flight in Switzerland. FC Basel bases its promotion of young talent on the following criteria: The primary aim of the FCB youth department is to integrate as many players as possible into the first team squad, all representatives of the youth department adhere to the values of the FCB charter, a uniform, holistic game and training idea from the FE-14 to the U21 ensures optimal training, the FCB follows a dual system of educational training and football.

The youth department has developed many Swiss internationals such as Erni Maissen, Adrian Knup, Alexander Frei, Marco Streller, Philipp, and David Degen. Since Basel moved into the St. Jakob-Park in 2001, they have strengthened their youth academy and many young talents like the Felipe Caicedo, Ivan Rakitić, Zdravko Kuzmanović, Xherdan Shaqiri, Yann Sommer, Eren Derdiyok, and Mohammed Salah have risen through the ranks there. In 2010 the former club president Gigi Oeri created the &quot;Stiftung Nachwuchs Campus Basel&quot; (in English &quot;foundation Youth Campus Basel)&quot; with the aim of continuously developing the club&#x27;s youth division on a long-term basis.

Since 2001, more than 50 successful players have risen through the Basel youth system and joined their first team, including:
The youth academy is as present set up in the following areas: Formation (U-21, U-19, U-17, U1-6 and U-15), Footeco (FE-14) and Project Team Basel (FE-12 and FE-13).

===Under-21 team===
The eldest members are in the U-21 team. This team plays in the Swiss Promotion League, the third highest level in the Swiss football league system, behind the Super League and the Challenge League. A number of players have professional contracts and often train or play with the first team.

===Current squad===










===Under-19 team===

Until 2023 there was no official Basel U-19 team, because a U-19 championship did not exist in Swiss football until then. Before then the team was quickly put together in the 2011–12 season from the youngest members of the first team, the younger Under-21 and the Under-18 teams who were eligible to play in the 2011–12 NextGen Series. &quot;

Because Basel qualified for the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League, the Under-19 team was again called to life and played in the 2013–14 UEFA Youth League. This time the members of this squad were solely members from the U-21 and U-18 teams, but the team only trained together once a week. &quot;

A year later Basel qualified for the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. Therefore, they were eligible to play in the 2014–15 UEFA Youth League and they took the matter a lot more seriously than the year before. Reserve team manager Thomas Häberli was also appointed as U-19 coach. Häberli&#x27;s U-19 squad was still a mix between the younger U-21 and the older U-18 teams, but the team had training together virtually daily. This resulted with improved results, the team winning four games from their six, but failing to qualify for the knockout phase on tiebreak. &quot;

Basel&#x27;s first team qualified for the Champions League again in 2016–17, so the U-19 team was revived for the 2016–17 UEFA Youth League. Raphaël Wicky was U-19 coach. In the group stage they reached second position and advanced to the play-offs, but lost this against Rosenborg. &quot;

By winning the U-18 Swiss championship at the end of the 2016–17 season the team qualified for the 2017–18 UEFA Youth League. Arjan Peço was the U-19 team coach at the time. The team were drawn into Group A which they won and advanced to the round of 16, but here they were eliminated by Atlético Madrid. &quot;&quot;

At the end of the 2017–18 season the U-18 team coached by Alex Frei won the Swiss championship and qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Youth League. But they were eliminated in the first round by Hamilton Academical, having drawn both matches 2–2, they were defeated in the penalty shoot-out. &quot;&quot;

In November 2021, the Swiss Football Association announced their amendments to their league structure and further expanded their promotion of young talents. The Basel U-18 team won the championship 2022–23 and in line with the Associations new league structures, FCB advanced all their U-18 team members to their newly created U-19 team, who were thus qualified for the 2023–24 UEFA Youth League. Here the team, under coach Mario Cantaluppi, advanced through the qualification but were eliminated by Bayern Munich in the play-offs. &quot;&quot;

===Other youth teams===
In total, the club has eight youth teams in their academy. In the group &quot;Formation&quot; are the U-21, U-19, U-17, U1-6 and U-15, in the group &quot;Footeco&quot; the FE-14 team and then there is the group &quot;Project Team Basel&quot; FE-12 and FE-13. Since the 2020–21 season, the FE-13 and FE-14 teams from the clubs FC Basel 1893, BSC Old Boys and FC Concordia Basel will appear with the addition of Team Basel.

<text>The Gorn are a fictional extraterrestrial humanoid reptilian species in the American science-fiction franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot;. They first appeared in a 1967 episode of the original series, &quot;Arena&quot;, in which Captain Kirk fights an unnamed Gorn on a rocky planet. The fight scene has become one of the best-remembered scenes of the original series, in part due to the slow and lumbering movement of the Gorn, which some viewers have considered unintentionally comical.

The Gorn have since appeared, or been mentioned, in various &quot;Star Trek&quot; books, video games, and other media properties, including the 1973 episode &quot;The Time Trap&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;. They finally appeared again in live-action form in a 2005 episode of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;In a Mirror Darkly, Part 2&quot;, this time with a more angular appearance and rendered using computer animation. Several Gorn spaceships (though no actual Gorn) appeared in a 2022 episode of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, &quot;Memento Mori&quot;. In a subsequent 2022 episode of &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot;, &quot;All Those Who Wander&quot;, Gorn hatchlings were shown as small, fast-moving, and instantly lethal predators, in contrast to the slow and humanoid adult Gorn previously seen.

==Fictional history==
According to the &quot;Starfleet Technical Manual&quot;, the Gorn are from Tau Lacertae IX.

The Gorn had contact with the Orion Syndicate as early as 2154. The name of their government was established as the Gorn Hegemony in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Bound&quot;.

In the episode &quot;Arena&quot; of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; TV series, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; pursues an alien ship of previously unknown design after it had attacked an Earth colony. A powerful race known as the Metrons force the captains of both ships to fight to settle the dispute. During the episode, the alien race is found to call themselves Gorn. This formal first contact with the Federation occurred at Cestus III in 2267.

A Gorn appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;The Time Trap&quot;.

Although the Gorn made territorial claims in the Cestus system in 2267, the Federation had a settlement there by 2371, indicating tension later softened enough for it to become a trading site between them or the Gorn had ceded the territory or had joined the Federation.

In 2005, an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; featured a Gorn (albeit in the Mirror Universe) in the episode &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly Part II&quot;. In that episode, the Gorn (whose name was Slar) was an overseer of a group of slaves belonging to the Mirror Universe&#x27;s Tholians in an attempt to steal technology from the &quot;Constitution&quot;-class NCC-1764 &quot;Defiant&quot;, which had been transferred into the Mirror Universe from ours. Slar hid in the ship&#x27;s corridors and killed several crewmembers until it was killed by Jonathan Archer.

A Gorn was slated to appear in the movie &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; as a friend of Worf&#x27;s at Riker&#x27;s bachelor party, according to an interview given by John Logan to &quot;Star Trek Communicator&quot; in 2003, but the scene was not in the final version of the film.

The series &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; features a character, La&#x27;an Noonien-Singh (played by Christina Chong), who is the sole survivor of a Gorn attack, an informal first contact before the formal one shown in &quot;Arena&quot;. In the 2022 episode &quot;Memento Mori&quot; of season one, the Gorn attack the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and the trauma previously suffered by La&#x27;an is a central theme of the episode. The Gorn do not actually appear onscreen in the episode, although several of their ships do. Captain Christopher Pike escapes the attack by luring the Gorn ships into a brown dwarf and slingshotting the &quot;Enterprise&quot; around a black hole.

The Gorn reappear in an episode of the same season, &quot;All Those Who Wander&quot;, wherein details of their biology are revealed. Gorn eggs are implanted in an Orion refugee, who fights the hatchlings and damages the USS &quot;Peregrine&quot;, crashing it on an ice planet. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew finds another refugee with a similar infestation in the &quot;Peregrine&quot;. The eggs are unable to be detected by Starfleet and other electromagnetic medical sensors, explaining medical staff&#x27;s inability to find the infestation and prevent the refugee&#x27;s death. The Gorn kill two Starfleet officers upon hatching. Noonien-Singh reveals that the hatchlings then fight each other to the death until the strongest one wins. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew uses this knowledge to defeat the Gorn before escaping aboard the repaired &quot;Peregrine&quot;, but not before the Gorn implant eggs in one of the bridge crew, the Aenar engineer Hemmer, forcing him to sacrifice himself by walking out into the planet&#x27;s cold to destroy the eggs.

==Depictions==

The Gorn was designed by artist Wah Chang, and is depicted in &quot;Arena&quot; as a hissing, slow-moving but lethal beast. The Gorn captain was portrayed by Bill Blackburn and Bobby Clark, and voiced by Ted Cassidy.

In the animated series, the Gorn appeared less harsh than in the original.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; appearance, the Gorn Slar was designed and rendered using computer animation, and looked different from the original appearance; the clearest difference was the lack of compound eyes. Slar also moved much faster than the Gorn Captain Kirk fought. Since &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; takes place entirely within the Mirror Universe, the contact seen between the Terran Empire and the creature does not contradict the first contact seen in &quot;Arena&quot;.

The 2022 &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; episode &quot;All Those Who Wander&quot;, depicts the Gorn as having prodigious speed and agility, and a physical form similar to their forms in the 2013 video game &quot;Star Trek&quot; (see below). The episode reveals key details of their biology, including their reproduction by mating, and then laying parasitic eggs in a host body through spraying venom at the body. The eggs hatch in a similar manner to the chest bursters from &quot;Alien&quot;. Gorn hatchlings can grow quickly; they and their egg forms have evolved the ability to evade Starfleet and other electromagnetic medical sensors. The episode also depicts their bodies, being reptilian, as sensitive to, and thus easily killed by, extreme cold.

In these novels, the Gorn have joined an interstellar organization known as the Typhon Pact (composed of the Gorn, Romulans, Tholians, Breen, Tzenkethi, and Kinshaya).
* The mirror universe counterparts of the Gorn appeared in &quot;Star Trek: Mirror Universe – Rise Like Lions&quot;.*
* Kirk mentions his fight with the Gorn in dialogue with the Romulan Commander in the 1977 novel &quot;The Price of the Phoenix&quot;.

===Comics===
* Gorn burial practices were discussed in an issue of Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Star Trek Unlimited&quot;.
* A Gorn appeared in the first DC Comics run of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, in 1984. Bones comments that he doesn&#x27;t have any tranquilizer strong enough to knock out a Gorn.
* The Gorn homeworld and government chamber are shown in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; trade paperback comic book &quot;The Gorn Crisis&quot;.

===Video games===
* A mini-campaign with a Gorn enemy and ally appear in the SNES game and PC game &quot;Starfleet Academy&quot;. There are video cutscenes featuring a Gorn, portrayed using a puppet. The ships are also playable in skirmish mode, and multiplayer games.
* Gorn appear in the PC game &quot;Starfleet Command&quot;.
* Gorn ships appear in the PC game &quot;Klingon Academy&quot;. They are also playable in skirmish mode.
* Gorn appear in the Nintendo game &quot;Star Trek: 25th Anniversary&quot;.
* Gorn are available as one of the playable races for the Klingon Empire in the PC game &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;. The &#x27;Gorn&#x27; jokes are a running gag in the online chat and spawned a fan-site of the species.
* Dr. McCoy referred to performing an emergency delivery of a brood of eight Gorn, noting &quot;those little bastards bite!&quot; in the 2013 film &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;. This is most likely a reference to the 2013 video game &quot;Star Trek&quot; due to McCoy performing a c-section of a Gorn in the game.
* Kirk and Spock fight the Gorn in the 2012 Star Trek Video Game.
*The Gorn appear in the 2013 video game &quot;Star Trek&quot;, set in the alternate universe of the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film. Taking place between the first film and its sequel, the Gorn appear as enemies attacking the New Vulcan colony. The Gorn shown are depicted as being a brutal race of imperialistic extra-galactic conquerors who had already taken over their galaxy before crossing over into the Milky Way. They are shown to have a rigid caste system based on skin coloration and intelligence levels with the more intelligent Gorn serving as soldiers, while primitive ones serve an attack-dog role. These Gorn are far more alien-looking and are not as fully bipedal as previous incarnations. Their relations to the Gorn of the original series are not known. 
* In &quot;Star Trek: Starfleet Command&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Starfleet Command II: Empires at War&quot; The Gorn&#x27;s government was referred to as the Gorn Confederation.
* The Gorn race also appears in the alternate non-canon Star Fleet Universe, represented in the range of games from Amarillo Design Bureau Inc. as well as the first two &quot;Star Fleet Command&quot; games (and the Orion Pirates stand-alone add on for &quot;Starfleet Command II&quot;) from Taldren. These are not considered canon with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies or series. In this continuum, the Gorn Confederation is a powerful empire located coreward of the Romulan Star Empire, also bordering the United Federation of Planets and the Interstellar Concordium. It comprises three genetically related races, each from a neighboring star system, known as Ghdar I, Ghdar II and Ghdar III. They are portrayed as a more civilized and cultured race than as referenced in the Paramount &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.
** They ally in Y174 with the Kzinti Hegemony, the Hydran Kingdoms, the Federation and the Tholian Holdfast in the General War. The alliance between the Gorns and the Federation – following a brief conflict over a misunderstanding regarding the Federation colony on Cestus III, a Gorn world – represents one of the few alliances that is based on mutual trust and desire for friendship as opposed to political convenience. They are mutually antagonistic with the Romulans, with whom they share a border with the Interstellar Concordium, and were among the first races to feel the effects of the ISC War of Pacification.
* The Gorn appear in the PC/Android/iOS game Star Trek Fleet Command, in which the player can obtain and perform game actions using a Gorn ship (&quot;Gorn Eviscerator&quot;), which resembles the Gorn ship type portrayed in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. There is also a system containing Gorn ships for the player to destroy for rewards, and a short Gorn themed mission arc.

===Board games===
* Gorn ships appeared in &quot;Star Trek: Starship Tactical Combat Simulator&quot; by FASA. Lead alloy versions of the MA-12 and the BH-2 were available in the late 1980s.

===Toys===
* A life-sized Gorn statue was on exhibit in the History of the Future museum in the Las Vegas Hilton&#x27;s Star Trek: The Experience attraction. Since the attraction&#x27;s closing, the figure&#x27;s current whereabouts are unknown.
* Gorn action figures have been available over the years including the Mego line from the 1970s, appearing in that line&#x27;s television commercials.

==Popular culture==

* &quot;MythBusters&quot;, a Discovery Channel television show that uses elements of the scientific method to test the validity of rumors, myths, film scenes, adages, Internet videos, and news stories, set out to prove whether or not it was possible for Captain Kirk to have constructed an effective bamboo cannon that could have injured a Gorn, as depicted in the climax of &quot;Arena&quot;. Their test showed that available bamboo was not strong enough to withstand the explosion. While Kirk would have been badly injured or killed, the Gorn would have been only slightly injured. However, the James Blish novelization of the episode indicated that although the plant looked like bamboo, it actually had a high metal content, so much so that it let out a distinct metallic sound when Kirk bumped it, the implication being that it was stronger than Earth bamboo.
*In the 2001 &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;The Kiss Seen Around the World&quot;, Neil Goldman plays the fight scene from the episode &quot;Arena&quot; in class, showing Captain Kirk fighting the Gorn, pointing out when it is William Shatner performing as Captain Kirk and his stunt double &quot;Fred Lubbins&quot;. In reality, the stunt double for the scene was Dick Dial. 
* A Gorn is shown reading &quot;Gorn&quot; magazine and sitting in Sheldon&#x27;s spot in the 2010 &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; season 4 episode &quot;The Apology Insufficiency&quot;.
* In the 2011 film &quot;Paul&quot;, Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings re-enact the canyon fight, Graeme as the Gorn and Clive as Kirk.
* A Gorn is shown at the conclusion of a dream by Sheldon Cooper in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; season 5 episode &quot;The Transporter Malfunction&quot; (2012).
* The Gorn appeared in the 2012 &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; season 6 episode &quot;In Bed Surrounded by Loved Ones&quot;, in which Kirk has &quot;stage 3 space Herpes&quot; and contacts the people he had sex with. One such encounter includes the Gorn (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) too, which they briefly fight before making out.
* A Gorn appeared with William Shatner in the preview/ad for the &quot;Star Trek 2&quot; game in 2013.

<text>John Carradine ( ; born Richmond Reed Carradine; February 5, 1906 – November 27, 1988) was an American actor, considered one of the greatest character actors in American cinema. He was a member of Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s stock company and later John Ford&#x27;s company, known for his roles in horror films, Westerns, and Shakespearean theater, most notably portraying Count Dracula in &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; (1944), &quot;House of Dracula&quot; (1945), &quot;Billy the Kid Versus Dracula&quot; (1966), and &quot;&quot; (1979). Among his other notable roles was &quot;Preacher Casy&quot; in John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. In later decades of his career, he starred mostly in low-budget B-movies. In total, he holds 351 film and television credits, making him one of the most prolific English-speaking film and television actors of all time.

Carradine was married four times, had five children, and was the patriarch of the Carradine family, including four sons and four grandchildren who are or were also actors.

==Early life==
Carradine was born in New York City the son of William Reed Carradine, a correspondent for the Associated Press, and his wife, Genevieve Winnifred Richmond, a surgeon. William Carradine was the son of evangelical author Beverly Carradine. The family lived in Peekskill, New York and Kingston, New York. William Carradine died from tuberculosis when his son John was two years old. Carradine&#x27;s mother then married &quot;a Philadelphia paper manufacturer named Peck, who thought the way to bring up someone else&#x27;s boy was to beat him every day just on general principle.&quot; Carradine attended the Christ Church School in Kingston and the Episcopal Academy in Merion Station, Pennsylvania, where he developed his diction and his memory skills from portions of the &quot;Episcopal Book of Common Prayer&quot; meted out as a punishment. 

Carradine&#x27;s son David claimed his father ran away when he was 14 years old. He later returned and studied sculpture at Philadelphia&#x27;s Graphic Arts Institute. Carradine lived with his maternal uncle, Peter Richmond, in New York City for a while, working in the film archives of the public library. David said that while still a teenager, his father went to Richmond, Virginia, to serve as an apprentice to Daniel Chester French, the sculptor who created the statue of Abraham Lincoln for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. He traveled for a time, supporting himself painting portraits. &quot;If the sitter was satisfied, the price was $2.50,&quot; he once said. &quot;It cost him nothing if he thought it was a turkey. I made as high as $10 to $15 a day.&quot; During this time, he was arrested for vagrancy. While in jail, Carradine was beaten, suffering a broken nose that did not set correctly. This contributed to &quot;the look that would become world famous.&quot;

David Carradine said, &quot;My dad told me that he saw a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; when he was 11 years old and decided right then what he wanted to do with his life&quot;. He made his stage debut in 1925 in New Orleans in a production of &quot;Camille&quot; and worked for a time in a New Orleans Shakespeare company. Carradine joined a tent repertory theater under the management of R. D. MacLean, who became his mentor. In 1927, he took a job escorting a shipment of bananas from Dallas, Texas to Los Angeles, where he eventually picked up some theater work under the name of Peter Richmond, in homage to his uncle. He became friends with John Barrymore, and began working for Cecil B. DeMille as a set designer. Carradine, however, did not have the job long. &quot;DeMille noticed the lack of Roman columns in my sketches,&quot; Carradine said. &quot;I lasted two weeks.&quot; Once DeMille heard his baritone voice, however, he hired him to do voice-overs. Carradine said, &quot;the great Cecil B. DeMille saw an apparition – me – pass him by, reciting the gravedigger&#x27;s lines from &#x27;Hamlet&#x27;, and he instructed me to report to him the following day.&quot; He became a member of DeMille&#x27;s stock company and his voice was heard in several DeMille pictures, including &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot;.

==Career==


Carradine&#x27;s first film credit was &quot;Tol&#x27;able David&quot; (1930), but he claimed to have done 70 pictures before getting billing. Carradine claimed to have tested, as an unknown – along with well-known leading men Conrad Veidt, William Courtenay, Paul Muni, and Ian Keith – for the title role in &quot;Dracula&quot;, but the historical record does not support the claim. The part eventually went to Bela Lugosi. Carradine later played the Count in the 1940s Universal Studios Dracula sequels &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;House of Dracula&quot;. Carradine also claimed to have tested for the monster role in &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), though again, no account exists other than his own that he actually did so. By 1933, he was being credited as John Peter Richmond, perhaps in honor of his friend, John Barrymore. He adopted the stage name &quot;John Carradine&quot; in 1935, and legally took the name as his own two years later. In 1935&#x27;s &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, Carradine had a brief uncredited walk on role as a hunter in the forest.

On April 11, 1934, Wilfred Talbot Smith and Regina Kahl of Ordo Templi Orientis held a &quot;Crowley Night on Winona Blvd&quot; at Agape Lodge. Martin Starr recounts that &quot;It included a program of recitation of (Aleister) Crowley&#x27;s poetry, rituals and sacred texts...One surprising name was among the participants: the stage and motion picture actor John Carradine...who read the Crowley poem, &quot;O Madonna of the Golden Eyes.&quot;

By 1936, Carradine had become a member of John Ford&#x27;s stock company and appeared in &quot;The Prisoner of Shark Island&quot;. In total, he made 11 pictures with Ford, including his first important role, as Preacher Casy in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940). Other Ford films in which Carradine appeared include &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962) and &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939).

He also portrayed the Biblical hero Aaron in DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), he dominated &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Madman&quot; (1943) as Reinhard Heydrich, and he portrayed Bob Ford in Henry King&#x27;s 20th Century Fox production &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939), among many many others during this time frame.

Carradine did considerable stage work, much of which provided his only opportunity to work in a classic drama context. He toured with his own Shakespearean company in the 1940s, playing Hamlet and Macbeth. His Broadway roles included Ferdinand in a 1946 production of John Webster&#x27;s &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;, the Ragpicker in a 13-month run of Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;, Lycus in a 15-month run of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;, and DeLacey in the expensive one-night flop &quot;Frankenstein&quot; in 1981. He also toured in road companies of such shows as &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,&quot; in which he was properly emaciated as the cancer-ridden Big Daddy, a part, he said, which Tennessee Williams wrote for him.

Carradine claimed to have appeared in more than 450 movies, but only 225 movies can be documented. His count is closer to fact if theatrical movies, made-for-TV movies, and television programs are included. He often played eccentric, insane, or diabolical characters, especially in the horror genre with which he had become identified as a &quot;star&quot; by the mid-1940s. He occasionally played a heroic role, as in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, in which he played Casy, the ill-fated &quot;preacher&quot;, and he occasionally played a sympathetic role, as in &quot;Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake&quot;, in which he played Blake&#x27;s shipmate, who escapes with him to a tropical island full of riches.

He appeared in dozens of low-budget horror films from the 1940s onwards, to finance a touring classical theater company. He also played a small but important role in the very-high-budget comedy &quot;The Court Jester&quot;, which was at the time of its release the most expensive comedy film ever made. He played a mad scientist in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot;. He sang the theme song to one film in which he appeared briefly, &quot;Red Zone Cuba&quot;. Carradine also made more than 100 acting appearances on television over a period of 39 years. His first performance on the &quot;small screen&quot; was on the DuMont Television Network in 1947, when he played Ebenezer Scrooge in a broadcast presentation of &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot; His final role on television was in 1986 as Professor Alex Stottel on a revival of the classic series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, in an episode segment titled &quot;Still Life.&quot; Some examples of other television series on which he appeared include &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot;, &quot;Johnny Ringo&quot; (as The Rain Man), and &quot;Place the Face&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Cimarron City&quot; as the foreboding Jared Tucker in the episode &quot;Child of Fear&quot; and on William Bendix&#x27;s &quot;Overland Trail&quot; in the 1960 episode &quot;The Reckoning,&quot; on &quot;Harrigan and Son&quot; starring Pat O&#x27;Brien in the episode &quot;A Matter of Dignity,&quot; &quot;Maverick&quot; in &quot;Red Dog&quot; starring Roger Moore and Lee Van Cleef, &quot;Sugarfoot&quot;, &quot;The Rebel&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Jesse James&quot;, on the syndicated adventure series &quot;Rescue 8&quot; with actor Jim Davis and in two episodes of the western TV series &quot;Bonanza&quot; (&quot;Springtime&quot; and &quot;Dead Wrong&quot;). John Carradine also appeared in 1959 as the mind reader in &quot;The Rifleman&quot; episode of the same name.

Carradine also made recurring appearances as the mortician Mr. Gateman on the television comedy series &quot;The Munsters&quot;. He appeared as well in both of Irwin Allen&#x27;s classic 1960s science-fiction television series &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and &quot;Land of the Giants&quot;. In 1975 he was in an episode of Sid and Marty Croft&#x27;s, &quot;Far Out Space Nuts&quot; with Chuck McCann and Bob Denver. In 1985, Carradine won a Daytime Emmy Award for his performance as an eccentric man who lives by the railroad tracks in the Young People&#x27;s Special &quot;Umbrella Jack&quot;.

In 1982, he supplied the voice of the Great Owl in the animated feature &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;. Also, he played the voice of the Wizard in the English-dubbed version of &quot;Aladdin and the Magic Lamp&quot;. One of Carradine&#x27;s later appearances was &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; in 1986. Carradine&#x27;s last released film credit was &quot;Jack-O&quot;, released years after his death.

Carradine&#x27;s deep, resonant voice earned him the nickname &quot;The Voice&quot;. He was known as the &quot;Bard of the Boulevard&quot; due to his idiosyncratic habit of strolling Hollywood streets while reciting Shakespearean soliloquies, something he always denied.

==Personal life and death==
Carradine was married four times. He married his first wife, Ardanelle Abigail McCool (January 25, 1911 – January 26, 1989), in 1935. She was the mother of Bruce and David. John adopted Bruce, Ardanelle&#x27;s son from a previous marriage. John had planned a large family, but according to the autobiography of his son David, after Ardanelle had had a series of miscarriages, Carradine discovered that she had repeated &quot;coat hanger&quot; abortions, without his knowledge, which rendered her unable to carry a baby to full term. After only three years of marriage, Ardanelle Carradine filed for divorce, but the couple remained married for another five years.

They divorced in 1944 when David was seven years old. Carradine left California to avoid court action in the alimony settlement. After the couple engaged in a series of court battles involving child custody and alimony, which at one point landed Carradine in jail, David joined his father in New York City. By this time, his father had remarried. For the next few years, David was shuffled among boarding schools, foster homes, and reform school.

In 1945, immediately following his divorce from Ardanelle, Carradine married Sonia Sorel (May 18, 1921 – September 24, 2004), who had appeared with him in the 1944 film &quot;Bluebeard&quot;. Sonia, who had adopted the stage name of Sorel, was the daughter of San Francisco brewer Henry Henius, granddaughter of biochemist Max Henius, and a great-niece of the historian Johan Ludvig Heiberg. Together, Carradine and Sonia had three sons, Christopher, Keith, and Robert. Their divorce in 1957 was followed by an acrimonious custody battle, which resulted in their sons being placed in a home for abused children as wards of the court. Keith Carradine said &quot;It was like being in jail. There were bars on the windows, and we were only allowed to see our parents through glass doors. It was very sad. We would stand there on either side of the glass door crying&quot;.

Eventually, Carradine won custody of the children. For the next eight years, Sonia was not permitted to see the children. Robert Carradine said that he was raised primarily by his stepmother, his father&#x27;s third wife, Doris (Rich) Grimshaw, and believed her to be his mother until he was introduced to Sonia Sorel at a Christmas party when he was 14 years old. He told a journalist &quot;I said, &#x27;How do you do?&#x27; Keith took me aside and said &#x27;That&#x27;s our real mother.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t know what he was talking about. But he finally convinced me.&quot;

When John Carradine married Doris (Erving Rich) Grimshaw in 1957, she already had a son, Dale, from a previous marriage and a son, Michael, from a later relationship. Both Dale and Michael, along with Sonia Sorel&#x27;s son, Michael Bowen, are sometimes counted among John Carradine&#x27;s eight sons. She was a one-time studio typist who typed the script to &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; and who played a few roles in film and television. Doris died in 1971 in a fire in her apartment in Oxnard, California. The fire was caused by a burning cigarette. She had been rescued from a similar fire two weeks earlier. At the time of her death, Carradine and she were separated. Carradine was married a fourth time, from 1975 to his 1988 death, to Emily Cisneros.

Semi-retired by the late 1980s, Carradine suffered from painful and crippling rheumatoid arthritis in the years before he died from heart and kidney failure at the in Milan, Italy on November 27, 1988, at the age of 82. Hours before he was stricken, he had climbed the 328 steep steps of Milan&#x27;s Gothic cathedral, the Duomo. According to David Carradine, his father had just finished a film (&quot;Buried Alive&quot;) in South Africa and was about to begin a European tour. David was with him, reading Shakespeare to him in his hospital bed, when he succumbed to his condition. By the time David and Keith Carradine had arrived at their father&#x27;s bedside at the hospital, he was unable to speak. &quot;I was told that his last words were &#x27;Milan: What a beautiful place to die.&#x27;&quot; David recalled, &quot;but he never spoke to me or opened his eyes. When he died, I was holding him in my arms. I reached out and closed his eyes. It&#x27;s not as easy as it is in the movies.&quot; There was a mass for John Carradine at St. Thomas the Apostle Episcopal Church in Hollywood. An Irish wake followed, and his body was buried at sea between the California coast and Catalina Island.

== Legacy ==
For his contributions to the film industry, Carradine was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 with a motion pictures star located at 6240 Hollywood Boulevard. In 2003, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Four of Carradine&#x27;s five sons became actors: David, Robert, Keith, and Bruce. David had a prolific career, amassing 227 movie and television credits by the time of his death in 2009. He also had a brief Broadway career and produced and directed a number of independent projects. His success often led to work for other members of his family, including his father. The two appeared together in a few films, including &quot;The Good Guys and the Bad Guys&quot; (1969) and &quot;Boxcar Bertha&quot; (1972), produced by Roger Corman and directed by Martin Scorsese.

David&#x27;s television series &quot;Kung Fu&quot; featured his father John and half-brother Robert in the episode &quot;Dark Angel&quot;. John appeared as the same character, the Reverend Serenity Johnson, in two more episodes: &quot;The Nature of Evil&quot; and &quot;Ambush&quot;. David&#x27;s brothers Bruce and Keith appeared in the series, with Keith playing David&#x27;s character as a teenager for a brief period. David, Keith, and Robert appeared together in a humorous cameo on &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, on an episode titled &quot;October the 31st&quot;, in which their father co-starred.

Robert appeared with his father in an episode of the first &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; revival television series in 1986. The episode segment titled &quot;Still Life&quot; featured Robert as a photographer who discovers an unusual camera and his father as a college professor who helps him discover the camera&#x27;s secret.

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham was a metropolitan borough in the County of London between 1900 and 1965, when it became part of the London Borough of Lewisham along with the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford.

==History==
The borough was formed by the London Government Act 1899 from the civil parishes of Lee from the Lee District and Lewisham from the Lewisham District. The borough also took in a small area formerly administered by Camberwell Vestry on the western slopes of Forest Hill.

While there had been minor industry along the River Ravensbourne for centuries and the extension of the railways had seen suburban development, there were still large areas of farmland at the time of the borough&#x27;s formation. The next London property boom in the 1930s saw much of that farmland built upon with both private estates, and the final gaps on the roads to Kent were filled in later on with London County Council built social housing, particularly in Downham and Bellingham.

==Geography==
The borough bordered Deptford, Greenwich, Camberwell, and had a portion of the southern boundary of the county of London.

Places in it included Lewisham, Blackheath, Lee, Hither Green, Catford, Brockley, Forest Hill and part of Sydenham.

==Population and area==
The area of the borough was . The population, as recorded at the census, was:

Constituent parishes 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961
==Coat of arms==

When the borough was created in 1900, a committee was appointed to design a coat of arms. This device, adopted in the following year, included a shield, crest, supporters and motto.

The shield had four quarters. The first quarter had the attributed arms of King Alfred, first lord of the manor. The second quarter showed a white on red horse, the arms associated with Kent. The Lewisham area was part of Kent until 1889. The third quarter showed a buck&#x27;s head, from the arms of the Earl of Dartmouth, lord of the manor of Lewisham in 1901. The fourth quarter featured a bear&#x27;s head and &quot;fesse&quot; or horizontal band, from the arms of Lord Northbrook, lord of the manor of Lee in 1901.

The crest was a raven, representing the Ravensbourne river.

The supporters were a silver buck sprinkled with red stars and a bear with a gold portcullis on his shoulder. These were also derived from the arms of the Earl of Dartmouth and Lord Northbrook respectively.

The Latin motto was &quot;Salus Populi Suprema Lex&quot;, or &quot;the welfare of the people is the highest law&quot; - a motto common to many English municipalities.

In 1950, in celebration of the borough&#x27;s golden jubilee, a grant of arms was obtained from the College of Arms.

The shield was greatly simplified: A Saxon crown and golden lion recalled the association of King Alfred with the area. The background of three colours recalled the three main areas of the borough: green for Lee Green, purple for Hither (or heather) Green and black for Blackheath.

The raven crest was retained, with the addition of a silver and blue wave for the Ravensbourne.

The 1901 supporters were altered to make them unique to the borough. Around their necks were placed mural crowns, representative of local government.

The motto was not changed, and was continued in use by the London Borough of Lewisham in 1965.

==Politics==

The borough was divided into ten wards for elections: Blackheath, Brockley, Catford, Church, Forest Hill, Lewisham Park, Lewisham Village, Manor, South and Sydenham.

===Borough council===

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was represented by one constituency:
*Lewisham
In 1918 the borough&#x27;s representation was increased to two seats:
*Lewisham East
*Lewisham West
In 1950 the borough&#x27;s representation was increased to three seats:
*Lewisham North
*Lewisham South
*Lewisham West

<text>The Metropolitan Borough of Deptford was a metropolitan borough in the County of London between 1900 and 1965, when it became part of the London Borough of Lewisham along with the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham.

==History==
The borough covered the same area of the parish of Deptford St Paul, which had been separated from the neighbouring parish of Deptford St Nicholas to its north in 1730. The rateable values of the two parishes had been roughly equal when they were separated, but St Paul contained all the farmland to the south, the majority of which was built on over the next 170 years.

When the Metropolitan Borough was created, consideration was given to reuniting the two parishes, but a closer equalisation of rateable value was served by uniting St Nicholas with Greenwich to the east.

The growth of the London conurbation had reached Deptford by the end of the eighteenth century but it had been a large industrial town well before this time: the Royal Docks and the Victualling Yard, which provisioned the Navy, and the various private dockyards, meant it was a prosperous and cosmopolitan town.

Deptford Town Hall was built between 1903 and 1905 on New Cross Road. The building is in a grand baroque style, featuring carvings of tritons and admirals to emphasise Deptford&#x27;s maritime heritage. It is now used by Goldsmiths College.

==Geography==
The borough was in south-east London and bordered Bermondsey, Greenwich, Lewisham and Camberwell.

The borough covered an area of and included the localities of St Paul Deptford, Brockley, New Cross, and St Johns.

==Population and area==
The area of the borough was . The population from each census was:

St Paul Deptford Civil Parish 1801–1899

Metropolitan Borough 1900–1961
==Coat of arms==
The borough did not have an officially granted coat of arms, instead using a device of their own design.

The three choughs in the first quarter represent the county of Surrey. They were taken from the arms of Onslow family, one-time lords of the manor of Guildford. The fourth quarter showed a white horse on red, representative of the county of Kent. Before 1889 the area of the borough was divided between the two counties. The second quarter showed a quarter ship on the stocks, for the naval dockyard. The remaining quarter of the shield was a portrait of Peter the Great of Russia, who learnt the art of naval architecture in Deptford.

Above the shield was a mural crown, representing municipal government. On either side was an heraldic dolphin entwining a trident.

==Politics==

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the parish of St Paul Deptford was divided into four wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 or North (15), No. 2 or South (21), No. 3 or East (18) and No. 4 or West (18).

The metropolitan borough was divided into six wards for elections: East, North West, North, South East, South West and South.

===Parliament constituency===
For elections to Parliament, the borough was represented by one constituency:

<text>ProSieben (, &quot;sieben&quot; is German for &quot;seven&quot;; often stylized as Pro7) is a German free-to-air television network owned by ProSiebenSat.1 Media.

It was launched on 1 January 1989. It is Germany&#x27;s second-largest privately owned television company. Although ProSieben produces some of its programming itself, it also airs many American imports. On 3 May 2012, the network launched a pay-TV channel called ProSieben Fun. A third channel called ProSieben Maxx started broadcasting on 3 September 2013.

The three different feeds of the channel are: ProSieben (for Germany), ProSieben Austria (for Austria), and ProSieben Schweiz (for Switzerland and Liechtenstein). The main difference is that they have different advertisements and news for each target country.

The channel uses an English slogan: &quot;We love to entertain you.&quot;

ProSieben broadcasts from the Astra 1L and 3A satellites and is uplinked by MX1 (now part of SES Video).

== History ==
=== 1988–1993 ===
On 13 October 1988, ProSieben Television GmbH was founded as a successor to Eureka TV. The founding partners were Gerhard Ackermans (51%) and Thomas Kirch (49%). Shortly after, Kirch took complete control of the channel.

On 1 January 1989, ProSieben began broadcasting nine hours of programming a day from Munich. The CEO was Georg Kofler from South Tyrol. ProSieben had 70 employees at that time and claimed to reach 2.44 million viewers.

The station began broadcasting on the DFS Kopernikus satellite in July 1989. Broadcasting hours were gradually increased to 17 hours a day. ProSieben was also awarded the first terrestrial frequency in Munich for a private broadcaster. Starting on 8 December 1989, the station was broadcast via Astra 1A satellite.

On 1 March 1990, the television station moved from Munich-Schwabing to Unterföhring near Munich. At that time, ProSieben had 120 employees. ProSieben has broadcast its programs around the clock since 1 October 1990.

In 1991, ProSieben created a subsidiary called Teledirekt GmbH to promote the spread of satellite technology in Germany. In 1992, although ProSieben was still losing money, it co-founded a special-interest channel, Der Kabelkanal, with German Bundespost TELEKOM. ProSieben held a 45% share. Since initially the channel could only be received via cable connection, the channel helped attract new customers to for Telekom&#x27;s cable television network. In 1995, ProSieben bought the channel outright and renamed it Kabel 1, and began broadcasting it on the SES Astra satellite.

In July 1992 MGM Media Gruppe München (ProSiebenSat.1 Media today) was established. It was responsible for selling advertising on ProSieben channels. On 24 September 1993, SZM Studios (broadcasting center in Munich, since June 2004: ProSiebenSat.1 Produktion GmbH) was inaugurated. At the end of 1993, ProSieben made a profit for the first time.

=== 1994–1999 ===

In 1994, ProSieben started a teletext service. On 24 October 1994, it started using a new station identity and logo. Turnover in 1994 was DM 1.192 billion (now about €786 million) and pre-tax profit was DM 144 million (today about €95 million). On 19 December 1995, ProSieben Television GmbH was transformed into a joint-stock company called ProSieben Television AG (after 1996 ProSieben Media AG, since 2000 ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG). Thomas Kirch remained the main shareholder and the Rewe Group was a co-shareholder with 41.6 percent. The chairman was Georg Kofler.

In 1996, ProSieben was granted a nationwide broadcast license and launched its Internet site. That same year, ProSieben bought AT &amp; TV Merchandising Concepts GmbH and Merchandising München KG. Sales rose to DM 1.69 billion.

Wholly owned subsidiaries of Pro Sieben Media AG in 1998 (incomplete list):
*&quot;Asta Vista&quot;
*&quot;Starwatch Navigation&quot;
*&quot;MGM Mediagruppe&quot;
*&quot;Agentur für Urheberrechte&quot;
*&quot;Pro Sieben Business Communication&quot;
*&quot;Pro Sieben Home Entertainment&quot;
*&quot;ddp&quot; news agency

Advertising slots were added for Switzerland in 1997 and Austria in 1998. ProSieben Austria also had its own news broadcast (ProSieben Austria News, formerly ProSieben Austria TopNews). Together with RTL, ProSieben operated a combined slot in Switzerland, which was cancelled after seven months in the spring of 2000. In Austria, there is a program slot on ProSieben Austria, Sat.1 Österreich and kabel eins Austria, which has been continuously expanded. In cooperation with the Austrian station Puls 4, the three-hour morning show &quot;Café Puls&quot; has been broadcast on all three stations since 2004.

On 7 July 1997, ProSieben went public, the shares were oversubscribed 50-fold. This way a nonvoting preference was used to divide up the shares. A year later, the company was added to MDAX. Berlin brought the inauguration of the DM 12 million ProSieben building in 1998. Kirch Media AG held 58.4% of ProSieben Media AG in 1998.

A news channel, N24 was started in 1999, it went on the air in early 2000. ProSieben wanted to compete with n-tv, which was very popular, mainly because of the stock market boom, and enlarge its family of channels. N24 now has a bigger audience share than n-tv, but is no longer owned by the company. In 1998, ProSieben took over the news agency ddp.

On 19 September 1999, ProSieben began broadcasting digital multichannel sound in Dolby Digital format.

=== 2000–2007 ===
At the end of 1999, Thomas Kirch brought over his shares in KirchMedia, his father&#x27;s company, which then made up the majority shares of Sat.1 and ProSieben-Gruppe. On 1 February 2000, the Swiss business lawyer Urs Rohner was appointed CEO of ProSieben; Georg Kofler, who was the CEO of ProSieben since its inception, resigned from the company. Urs Rohner had no experience in the television business. He was appointed at the request of Leo Kirch to legally secure the fusion between Sat.1 and ProSieben.

In March 2000, the ProSieben subsidiary SevenSenses was established, to which in June 2004 merged with the SZM Studios to create the ProSiebenSat.1 Produktion GmbH.
On 13 October 2000, 12 years after the founding of ProSieben, the first shares from ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG were traded at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. In the following month, the merger of the marketing companies occurred between Media Group Munich (ProSieben) and MEDIA 1, creating SevenOne Media.

With the merger came the founding of the ProSieben Television GmbH, which operates the ProSieben television station.

Managing director of ProSieben was Nicolas Paalzow in 2000. He was succeeded in May 2004 by Dejan Jocic, who was then replaced in December 2005 by Andreas Bartl - who was previously CEO of kabel eins. In May 2008, Thilo Proff became chief of the station, followed by Jürgen Hörner (April 2011). Since August 2012, Wolfgang Link is the managing director of ProSieben.

After 2003, the ProSiebenSat.1 Media belonged to a group of investors surrounding Haim Saban.

In 2005, Axel Springer SE wanted to take over ProSieben for about €2.2 billion, which would have created the third-largest media group in Europe. This purchase, however, at the end of 2005 / beginning of 2006 was not authorized by the Federal Cartel Office and the Commission on Concentration in the Media. On 31 January 2006, Springer finally announced the failure of the takeover. Saban stuck to the intention to sell the channel. On 14 December 2006, the investment companies KKR and Permira took over a majority shares (50.5%) of the stock capital of ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG and became new majority shareholder.

In 2007, through the initiative of KKR and Permira, ProSieben bought the SBS Broadcasting Group, for €3.3 billion and financed the acquisition largely through loans.

<text>The game of chicken, also known as the hawk-dove game or snowdrift game, is a model of conflict for two players in game theory. The principle of the game is that while the ideal outcome is for one player to yield (to avoid the worst outcome if neither yields), individuals try to avoid it out of pride, not wanting to look like &quot;chickens&quot;. Each player taunts the other to increase the risk of shame in yielding. However, when one player yields, the conflict is avoided, and the game essentially ends.

The name &quot;chicken&quot; has its origins in a game in which two drivers drive toward each other on a collision course: one must swerve, or both may die in the crash, but if one driver swerves and the other does not, the one who swerved will be called a &quot;chicken&quot;, meaning a coward; this terminology is most prevalent in political science and economics. The name &quot;hawk–dove&quot; refers to a situation in which there is a competition for a shared resource and the contestants can choose either conciliation or conflict; this terminology is most commonly used in biology and evolutionary game theory. From a game-theoretic point of view, &quot;chicken&quot; and &quot;hawk–dove&quot; are identical. The game has also been used to describe the mutual assured destruction of nuclear warfare, especially the sort of brinkmanship involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

==Popular versions==

The game of chicken models two drivers, both headed for a single-lane bridge from opposite directions. The first to swerve away yields the bridge to the other. If neither player swerves, the result is a costly deadlock in the middle of the bridge or a potentially fatal head-on collision. It is presumed that the best thing for each driver is to stay straight while the other swerves (since the other is the &quot;chicken&quot; while a crash is avoided). Additionally, a crash is presumed to be the worst outcome for both players. This yields a situation where each player, in attempting to secure their best outcome, risks the worst.

The phrase &quot;game of chicken&quot; is also used as a metaphor for a situation where two parties engage in a showdown where they have nothing to gain and only pride stops them from backing down. Bertrand Russell famously compared the game of Chicken to nuclear brinkmanship:Since the nuclear stalemate became apparent, the governments of East and West have adopted the policy that Mr. Dulles calls &#x27;brinkmanship&#x27;. This is a policy adapted from a sport that, I am told, is practiced by some youthful degenerates. This sport is called &#x27;Chicken!&#x27;. It is played by choosing a long, straight road with a white line down the middle and starting two very fast cars toward each other from opposite ends. Each car is expected to keep the wheels on one side of the white line. As they approach each other, mutual destruction becomes more and more imminent. If one of them swerves from the white line before the other, the other, as they pass, shouts &#x27;Chicken!&#x27;, and the one who has swerved becomes an object of contempt. As played by irresponsible boys, this game is considered decadent and immoral, though only the lives of the players are risked. But when the game is played by eminent statesmen, who risk not only their own lives but those of many hundreds of millions of human beings, it is thought on both sides that the statesmen on one side are displaying a high degree of wisdom and courage, and only the statesmen on the other side are reprehensible. This, of course, is absurd. Both are to blame for playing such an incredibly dangerous game. The game may be played without misfortune a few times, but sooner or later, it will come to be felt that loss of face is more dreadful than nuclear annihilation. The moment will come when neither side can face the derisive cry of &#x27;Chicken!&#x27; from the other side. When that moment comes, the statesmen of both sides will plunge the world into destruction.Brinkmanship involves the introduction of an element of uncontrollable risk: even if all players act rationally in the face of risk, uncontrollable events can still trigger the catastrophic outcome. In the &quot;chickie run&quot; scene from the film &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;, this happens when Buzz cannot escape from the car and dies in the crash. The opposite scenario occurs in &quot;Footloose&quot; where Ren McCormack is stuck in his tractor and hence wins the game as they cannot play &quot;chicken&quot;. A similar event happens in two different games in the film &quot;The Heavenly Kid&quot;, when first Bobby, and then later Lenny become stuck in their cars and drive off a cliff. The basic game-theoretic formulation of Chicken has no element of variable, potentially catastrophic, risk, and is also the contraction of a dynamic situation into a one-shot interaction.

The hawk–dove version of the game imagines two players (animals) contesting an indivisible resource who can choose between two strategies, one more escalated than the other. They can use threat displays (play Dove), or physically attack each other (play Hawk). If both players choose the Hawk strategy, then they fight until one is injured and the other wins. If only one player chooses Hawk, then this player defeats the Dove player. If both players play Dove, there is a tie, and each player receives a payoff lower than the profit of a hawk defeating a dove.

==Game theoretic applications==

===Chicken===

A formal version of the game of Chicken has been the subject of serious research in game theory. Two versions of the payoff matrix for this game are presented here (Figures 1 and 2). In Figure 1, the outcomes are represented in words, where each player would prefer to win over tying, prefer to tie over losing, and prefer to lose over crashing. Figure 2 presents arbitrarily set numerical payoffs which theoretically conform to this situation. Here, the benefit of winning is 1, the cost of losing is -1, and the cost of crashing is -1000.

Both Chicken and Hawk–Dove are &quot;anti-coordination games&quot;, in which it is mutually beneficial for the players to play different strategies. In this way, it can be thought of as the opposite of a coordination game, where playing the same strategy Pareto dominates playing different strategies. The underlying concept is that players use a shared resource. In coordination games, sharing the resource creates a benefit for all: the resource is non-rivalrous, and the shared usage creates positive externalities. In anti-coordination games the resource is rivalrous but non-excludable and sharing comes at a cost (or negative externality).

Because the loss of swerving is so trivial compared to the crash that occurs if nobody swerves, the reasonable strategy would seem to be to swerve before a crash is likely. Yet, knowing this, if one believes one&#x27;s opponent to be reasonable, one may well decide not to swerve at all, in the belief that the opponent will be reasonable and decide to swerve, leaving the first player the winner. This unstable situation can be formalized by saying there is more than one Nash equilibrium, which is a pair of strategies for which neither player gains by changing their own strategy while the other stays the same. (In this case, the pure strategy equilibria are the two situations wherein one player swerves while the other does not.)

===Hawk–dove===


In the biological literature, this game is known as Hawk–Dove. The earliest presentation of a form of the Hawk–Dove game was by John Maynard Smith and George Price in their paper, &quot;The logic of animal conflict&quot;. The traditional payoff matrix for the Hawk–Dove game is given in Figure 3, where V is the value of the contested resource, and C is the cost of an escalated fight. It is (almost always) assumed that the value of the resource is less than the cost of a fight, i.e., C &gt; V &gt; 0. If C ≤ V, the resulting game is not a game of Chicken but is instead a Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma.

The exact value of the Dove vs. Dove payoff varies between model formulations. Sometimes the players are assumed to split the payoff equally (V/2 each), other times the payoff is assumed to be zero (since this is the expected payoff to a war of attrition game, which is the presumed models for a contest decided by display duration).

While the Hawk–Dove game is typically taught and discussed with the payoffs in terms of V and C, the solutions hold true for any matrix with the payoffs in Figure 4, where W &gt; T &gt; L &gt; X.

====Hawk–dove variants====
Biologists have explored modified versions of classic Hawk–Dove game to investigate a number of biologically relevant factors. These include adding variation in resource holding potential, and differences in the value of winning to the different players, allowing the players to threaten each other before choosing moves in the game, and extending the interaction to two plays of the game.

====Pre-commitment====
One tactic in the game is for one party to signal their intentions convincingly before the game begins. For example, if one party were to ostentatiously disable their steering wheel just before the match, the other party would be compelled to swerve. This shows that, in some circumstances, reducing one&#x27;s own options can be a good strategy. One real-world example is a protester who handcuffs themselves to an object, so that no threat can be made which would compel them to move (since they cannot move). Another example, taken from fiction, is found in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;. In that film, the Russians sought to deter American attack by building a &quot;doomsday machine&quot;, a device that would trigger world annihilation if Russia was hit by nuclear weapons or if any attempt were made to disarm it. However, the Russians had planned to signal the deployment of the machine a few days after having set it up, which, because of an unfortunate course of events, turned out to be too late.

Players may also make non-binding threats to not swerve. This has been modeled explicitly in the Hawk–Dove game. Such threats work, but must be wastefully costly if the threat is one of two possible signals (&quot;I will not swerve&quot; or &quot;I will swerve&quot;), or they will be costless if there are three or more signals (in which case the signals will function as a game of &quot;rock, paper, scissors&quot;).

==Best response mapping and Nash equilibria==
All anti-coordination games have three Nash equilibria. Two of these are pure contingent strategy profiles, in which each player plays one of the pair of strategies, and the other player chooses the opposite strategy. The third one is a mixed equilibrium, in which each player probabilistically chooses between the two pure strategies. Either the pure, or mixed, Nash equilibria will be evolutionarily stable strategies depending upon whether uncorrelated asymmetries exist.

The best response mapping for all 2x2 anti-coordination games is shown in Figure 5. The variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in Figure 5 are the probabilities of playing the escalated strategy (&quot;Hawk&quot; or &quot;Don&#x27;t swerve&quot;) for players X and Y respectively. The line in graph on the left shows the optimum probability of playing the escalated strategy for player Y as a function of &quot;x&quot;. The line in the second graph shows the optimum probability of playing the escalated strategy for player X as a function of &quot;y&quot; (the axes have not been rotated, so the dependent variable is plotted on the abscissa, and the independent variable is plotted on the ordinate). The Nash equilibria are where the players&#x27; correspondences agree, i.e., cross. These are shown with points in the right hand graph. The best response mappings agree (i.e., cross) at three points. The first two Nash equilibria are in the top left and bottom right corners, where one player chooses one strategy, the other player chooses the opposite strategy. The third Nash equilibrium is a mixed strategy which lies along the diagonal from the bottom left to top right corners. If the players do not know which one of them is which, then the mixed Nash is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), as play is confined to the bottom left to top right diagonal line. Otherwise an uncorrelated asymmetry is said to exist, and the corner Nash equilibria are ESSes.

===Strategy polymorphism vis-à-vis strategy mixing===
The ESS for the Hawk–Dove game is a mixed strategy. Formal game theory is indifferent to whether this mixture is due to all players in a population choosing randomly between the two pure strategies (a range of possible instinctive reactions for a single situation) or whether the population is a polymorphic mixture of players dedicated to choosing a particular pure strategy(a single reaction differing from individual to individual). Biologically, these two options are strikingly different ideas. The Hawk–Dove game has been used as a basis for evolutionary simulations to explore which of these two modes of mixing ought to predominate in reality.

==Symmetry breaking==
In both &quot;Chicken&quot; and &quot;Hawk–Dove&quot;, the only symmetric Nash equilibrium is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, where both individuals randomly chose between playing Hawk/Straight or Dove/Swerve. This mixed strategy equilibrium is often sub-optimal—both players would do better if they could coordinate their actions in some way. This observation has been made independently in two different contexts, with almost identical results.

===Correlated equilibrium and the game of chicken===

Consider the version of &quot;Chicken&quot; pictured in Figure 6. Like all forms of the game, there are three Nash equilibria. The two pure strategy Nash equilibria are (&quot;D&quot;, &quot;C&quot;) and (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;). There is also a mixed strategy equilibrium where each player Dares with probability 1/3. It results in expected payoffs of 14/3 = 4.667 for each player.

Now consider a third party (or some natural event) that draws one of three cards labeled: (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), (&quot;D&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), and (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;). This exogenous draw event is assumed to be uniformly at random over the 3 outcomes. After drawing the card the third party informs the players of the strategy assigned to them on the card (but not the strategy assigned to their opponent). Suppose a player is assigned &quot;D&quot;, they would not want to deviate supposing the other player played their assigned strategy since they will get 7 (the highest payoff possible). Suppose a player is assigned &quot;C&quot;. Then the other player has been assigned &quot;C&quot; with probability 1/2 and &quot;D&quot; with probability 1/2 (due to the nature of the exogenous draw). The expected utility of Daring is 0(1/2) + 7(1/2) = 3.5 and the expected utility of chickening out is 2(1/2) + 6(1/2) = 4. So, the player would prefer to chicken out.

Since neither player has an incentive to deviate from the drawn assignments, this probability distribution over the strategies is known as a correlated equilibrium of the game. Notably, the expected payoff for this equilibrium is 7(1/3) + 2(1/3) + 6(1/3) = 5 which is higher than the expected payoff of the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

===Uncorrelated asymmetries and solutions to the hawk–dove game===

Although there are three Nash equilibria in the Hawk–Dove game, the one which emerges as the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) depends upon the existence of any uncorrelated asymmetry in the game (in the sense of anti-coordination games). In order for row players to choose one strategy and column players the other, the players must be able to distinguish which role (column or row player) they have. If no such uncorrelated asymmetry exists then both players must choose the same strategy, and the ESS will be the mixing Nash equilibrium. If there is an uncorrelated asymmetry, then the mixing Nash is not an ESS, but the two pure, role contingent, Nash equilibria are.

The standard biological interpretation of this uncorrelated asymmetry is that one player is the territory owner, while the other is an intruder on the territory. In most cases, the territory owner plays Hawk while the intruder plays Dove. In this sense, the evolution of strategies in Hawk–Dove can be seen as the evolution of a sort of prototypical version of ownership. Game-theoretically, however, there is nothing special about this solution. The opposite solution—where the owner plays dove and the intruder plays Hawk—is equally stable. In fact, this solution is present in a certain species of spider; when an invader appears the occupying spider leaves. In order to explain the prevalence of property rights over &quot;anti-property rights&quot; one must discover a way to break this additional symmetry.

==Replicator dynamics==
Replicator dynamics is a simple model of strategy change commonly used in evolutionary game theory. In this model, a strategy which does better than the average increases in frequency at the expense of strategies that do worse than the average. There are two versions of the replicator dynamics. In one version, there is a single population which plays against itself. In another, there are two population models where each population only plays against the other population (and not against itself).

In the one population model, the only stable state is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Every initial population proportion (except all &quot;Hawk&quot; and all &quot;Dove&quot;) converge to the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium where part of the population plays &quot;Hawk&quot; and part of the population plays &quot;Dove&quot;. (This occurs because the only ESS is the mixed strategy equilibrium.) In the two population model, this mixed point becomes unstable. In fact, the only stable states in the two population model correspond to the pure strategy equilibria, where one population is composed of all &quot;Hawks&quot; and the other of all &quot;Dove&quot;s. In this model one population becomes the aggressive population while the other becomes passive. This model is illustrated by the vector field pictured in Figure 7a. The one-dimensional vector field of the single population model (Figure 7b) corresponds to the bottom left to top right diagonal of the two population model.

The single population model presents a situation where no uncorrelated asymmetries exist, and so the best players can do is randomize their strategies. The two population models provide such an asymmetry and the members of each population will then use that to correlate their strategies. In the two population model, one population gains at the expense of another. Hawk–Dove and Chicken thus illustrate an interesting case where the qualitative results for the two different versions of the replicator dynamics differ wildly.

==Related strategies and games==

===Brinkmanship===
&quot;Chicken&quot; and &quot;Brinkmanship&quot; are often used synonymously in the context of conflict, but in the strict game-theoretic sense, &quot;brinkmanship&quot; refers to a strategic move designed to avert the possibility of the opponent switching to aggressive behavior. The move involves a credible threat of the risk of irrational behavior in the face of aggression. If player 1 unilaterally moves to A, a rational player 2 cannot retaliate since (A, C) is preferable to (A, A). Only if player 1 has grounds to believe that there is sufficient risk that player 2 responds irrationally (usually by giving up control over the response, so that there is sufficient risk that player 2 responds with A) player 1 will retract and agree on the compromise.

===War of attrition===
Like &quot;Chicken&quot;, the &quot;War of attrition&quot; game models escalation of conflict, but they differ in the form in which the conflict can escalate. Chicken models a situation in which the catastrophic outcome differs in kind from the agreeable outcome, e.g., if the conflict is over life and death. War of attrition models a situation in which the outcomes differ only in degrees, such as a boxing match in which the contestants have to decide whether the ultimate prize of victory is worth the ongoing cost of deteriorating health and stamina.

===Hawk–dove and war of attrition===
The Hawk–Dove game is the most commonly used game theoretical model of aggressive interactions in biology. The war of attrition is another very influential model of aggression in biology. The two models investigate slightly different questions. The Hawk–Dove game is a model of escalation, and addresses the question of when ought an individual escalate to dangerously costly physical combat. The war of attrition seeks to answer the question of how contests may be resolved when there is no possibility of physical combat. The war of attrition is an auction in which both players pay the lower bid (an all-pay second price auction). The bids are assumed to be the duration which the player is willing to persist in making a costly threat display. Both players accrue costs while displaying at each other, the contest ends when the individual making the lower bid quits. Both players will then have paid the lower bid.

===Chicken and prisoner&#x27;s dilemma===
Chicken is a symmetrical 2x2 game with conflicting interests, the preferred outcome is to play &quot;Straight&quot; while the opponent plays &quot;Swerve&quot;. Similarly, the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is a symmetrical 2x2 game with conflicting interests: the preferred outcome is to &quot;Defect&quot; while the opponent plays &quot;Cooperate&quot;. PD is about the impossibility of cooperation while Chicken is about the inevitability of conflict. Iterated play can solve PD but not Chicken.

Both games have a desirable cooperative outcome in which both players choose the less escalated strategy, &quot;Swerve-Swerve&quot; in the Chicken game, and &quot;Cooperate-Cooperate&quot; in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, such that players receive the &quot;Coordination&quot; payoff C (see tables below). The temptation away from this sensible outcome is toward a &quot;Straight&quot; move in Chicken and a &quot;Defect&quot; move in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma (generating the Temptation payoff, should the other player use the less escalated move). The essential difference between these two games is that in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, the &quot;Cooperate&quot; strategy is dominated, whereas in Chicken the equivalent move is not dominated since the outcome payoffs when the opponent plays the more escalated move (&quot;Straight&quot; in place of &quot;Defect&quot;) are reversed.

==Schedule chicken and project management==

The term &quot;schedule chicken&quot; is used in project management and software development circles. The condition occurs when two or more areas of a product team claim they can deliver features at an unrealistically early date because each assumes the other teams are stretching the predictions even more than they are. This pretense continually moves forward past one project checkpoint to the next until feature integration begins or just before the functionality is actually due.

The practice of &quot;schedule chicken&quot; often results in contagious schedule slips due to the inter-team dependencies and is difficult to identify and resolve, as it is in the best interest of each team not to be the first bearer of bad news. The psychological drivers underlining the &quot;schedule chicken&quot; behavior in many ways mimic the hawk–dove or snowdrift model of conflict.

<text>A sedan or saloon (British English) is a passenger car in a three-box configuration with separate compartments for an engine, passengers, and cargo. The first recorded use of &quot;sedan&quot; in reference to an automobile body occurred in 1912. The name derives from the 17th-century litter known as a sedan chair, a one-person enclosed box with windows and carried by porters. Variations of the sedan style include the close-coupled sedan, club sedan, convertible sedan, fastback sedan, hardtop sedan, notchback sedan, and sedanet.

==Definition==
A sedan () is a car with a closed body (i.e., a fixed metal roof) with the engine, passengers, and cargo in separate compartments. This broad definition does not differentiate sedans from various other car body styles. Still, in practice, the typical characteristics of sedans are:
* a B-pillar (between the front and rear windows) that supports the roof;
* two rows of seats;
* a three-box design with the engine at the front and the cargo area at the rear;
* a less steeply sloping roofline than a coupé results in increased headroom for rear passengers and a less sporting appearance; and
* a rear interior volume of at least .
It is sometimes suggested that sedans must have four doors (to provide a simple distinction between sedans and two-door coupés); others state that a sedan can have four or two doors. Although the sloping rear roofline defined the coupe, the design element has become common on many body styles with manufacturers increasingly &quot;cross-pollinating&quot; the style so that terms such as sedan and coupé have been loosely interpreted as &quot;&#x27;four-door coupes&#x27; - an inherent contradiction in terms.&quot;

When a manufacturer produces two-door sedan and four-door sedan versions of the same model, the shape and position of the greenhouse on both versions may be identical, with only the B-pillar positioned further back to accommodate the longer doors on the two-door versions.

== Etymology ==

A sedan chair, a sophisticated litter, is an enclosed box with windows used to transport one seated person. Porters at the front and rear carry the chair with horizontal poles. Litters date back to long before ancient Egypt, India, and China. Sedan chairs were developed in the 1630s. Etymologists suggest the name of the chair very probably came through varieties of Italian from the Latin &quot;sedere&quot;, or the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;sed-&quot; meaning &quot;to sit.&quot;
The first recorded use of sedan for an automobile body occurred in 1912 when the Studebaker Four and Studebaker Six models were marketed as sedans. There were fully enclosed automobile bodies before 1912. Long before that time, the same fully enclosed but horse-drawn carriages were known as a &quot;brougham&quot; in the United Kingdom, &quot;berline&quot; in France, and &quot;berlina&quot; in Italy; the latter two have become the terms for sedans in these countries. It is sometimes stated that the 1899 Renault Voiturette Type B (a 2-seat car with an extra external seat for a footman/mechanic) was the first sedan, since it is the first known car to be produced with a roof. A one-off instance of similar coachwork is also known in a 1900 De Dion-Bouton Type D.

A sedan is typically considered to be a fixed-roof car with at least four seats. Based on this definition, the earliest sedan was the 1911 Speedwell, which was manufactured in the United States.

==International terminology==

In American English, Latin American Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese, the term &quot;sedan&quot; is used (accented as &quot;sedán&quot; in Spanish). In British English, a car of this configuration is called a &quot;saloon&quot; (). Hatchback sedans are known simply as &quot;hatchbacks&quot; (not &quot;hatchback saloons&quot;); long-wheelbase luxury saloons with a division between the driver and passengers are &quot;limousines&quot;.

In Australia and New Zealand, &quot;sedan&quot; is now predominantly used; they were previously simply cars. In the 21st century, &quot;saloon&quot; remains in the long-established names of particular motor races. In other languages, sedans are known as &quot;berline&quot; (French), &quot;berlina&quot; (European Spanish, European Portuguese, Romanian, and Italian), though they may include hatchbacks. These names, like the sedan, all come from forms of passenger transport used before the advent of automobiles. In German, a sedan is called &quot;Limousine&quot; and a limousine is a &quot;Stretch-Limousine&quot;.

In the United States, two-door sedan models were marketed as Tudor in the Ford Model A (1927–1931) series. Automakers use different terms to differentiate their products and for Ford&#x27;s sedan body styles &quot;the tudor (2-door) and fordor (4-door) were marketing terms designed to stick in the minds of the public.&quot; Ford continued to use the Tudor name for 5-window coupes, 2-door convertibles, and roadsters since all had two doors. The Tudor name was also used to describe the Škoda 1101/1102 introduced in 1946. The public popularized the name for a two-door model and was then applied by the automaker to the entire line that included a four-door sedan and station wagon versions.

== Standard styles ==
===Notchback sedans===
In the United States, the notchback sedan distinguishes models with a horizontal trunk lid. The term is generally only referred to in marketing when it is necessary to differentiate between two sedan body styles (e.g., notchback and fastback) of the same model range.

===Liftback sedans===
Several sedans have a fastback profile but a hatchback-style tailgate is hinged at the roof. Examples include the Peugeot 309, Škoda Octavia, Hyundai Elantra XD, Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, BMW 4 Series Grand Coupe, Audi A5 Sportback, and Tesla Model S. The names hatchback and sedan are often used to differentiate between body styles of the same model. To avoid confusion, the term hatchback sedan is not often used.

===Fastback sedans===
There have been many sedans with a fastback style.
===Hardtop sedans===


Hardtop sedans were a popular body style in the United States from the 1950s to the 1970s. Hardtops are manufactured without a B-pillar leaving uninterrupted open space or, when closed, glass along the side of the vehicle. The top was intended to look like a convertible&#x27;s top. However, it was fixed and made of hard material that did not fold.

All manufacturers in the United States from the early 1950s into the 1970s provided at least a two-door hardtop model in their range and a four-door hardtop. The lack of side bracing demanded a strong, heavy chassis frame to combat unavoidable flexing. The pillarless design was also available in four-door models using unibody construction. For example, Chrysler moved to unibody designs for most of its models in 1960 and American Motors Corporation (AMC) offered four-door sedans, as well a four-door station wagon from 1958 until 1960 in the Rambler and Ambassador series.

In 1973, the US government passed Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 216 creating a standard roof strength test to measure the integrity of roof structure in motor vehicles to come into effect some years later. The objective was to reduce deaths and injuries due to the car&#x27;s roof crushing into the passenger compartment in case of a rollover crash. Hardtop sedan body style production ended with the 1978 Chrysler Newport. Roofs were often available with standard or optional vinyl cover. The structural B-pillar design was minimized by styling methods like matt black finishes. Stylists and engineers soon developed more subtle solutions.

==Mid-20th century variations==
===Close-coupled sedans===

A close-coupled sedan is a body style produced in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s. Their two-box boxy styling made these sedans more like crossover vehicles than traditional three-box sedans. Like other close-coupled body styles, the rear seats are farther forward than a regular sedan. This reduced the length of the body; close-coupled sedans, also known as town sedans, were the shortest of the sedan models offered.

Models of close-coupled sedans include the Chrysler Imperial, Duesenberg Model A, and Packard 745

===Coach sedans===

A two-door sedan for four or five passengers but with less room for passengers than a standard sedan. A Coach body has no external trunk for luggage. Haajanen says it can be difficult to tell the difference between a Club and a Brougham and a Coach body, as if manufacturers were more concerned with marketing their product than adhering to strict body style definitions.

===Close-coupled saloons===

Close-coupled saloons originated as four-door thoroughbred sporting horse-drawn carriages with little room for rear passengers&#x27; feet. In automotive use, manufacturers in the United Kingdom used the term to develop the chummy body, where passengers were forced to be friendly because they were tightly packed. They provided weather protection for extra passengers in what would otherwise be a two-seater car. Two-door versions would be described in the United States and France as coach bodies. A postwar example is the Rover 3 Litre Coupé.

===Club sedans===

Produced in the United States from the mid-1920s to the mid-1950s, the name club sedan was used for highly appointed models using the sedan chassis. Some people describe a club sedan as a two-door vehicle with a body style otherwise identical to the sedan models in the range. Others describe a club sedan as having either two or four doors and a shorter roof and therefore less interior space than the other sedan models in the range.

&quot;Club sedan&quot; originates from a railroad train&#x27;s club carriage (e.g., the lounge or parlour carriage).

===Sedanets===
From the 1910s to the 1950s, several United States manufacturers have named models either Sedanet or Sedanette. The term originated as a smaller version of the sedan; however, it has also been used for convertibles and fastback coupes. Models that have been called Sedanet or Sedanette include the 1917 Dort Sedanet, King, 1919 Lexington, 1930s Cadillac Fleetwood Sedanette, 1949 Cadillac Series 62 Sedanette, 1942-1951 Buick Super Sedanet, and 1956 Studebaker.

<text>The Mississauga Horse was a cavalry regiment of the Non-Permanent Active Militia of the Canadian Militia (now the Canadian Army). In 1936, they were amalgamated with The Governor General&#x27;s Body Guard to form The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards.

== Lineage ==
* 1 April 1901: Toronto Mounted Rifles formed from J and K Squadrons Canadian Mounted Rifles
* 1 April 1903: 9th Toronto Light Horse
* 1 May 1905: 9th Mississauga Horse
* 15 Mar 1920: The Ontario Mounted Rifles
* 1 April 1924: The Mississauga Horse
* 15 December 1936: amalgamated with The Governor General&#x27;s Body Guard, to form The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards

== Perpetuations ==
* 4th Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles
* 7th Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles

== History ==
It was originally formed as the Toronto Mounted Rifles at Toronto, Ontario, on April 1, 1901, by combining J and K Squadrons of the Canadian Mounted Rifles with three newly raised companies. In 1903 the regiment was renamed to the 9th Toronto Light Horse and in 1907 it was renamed to the 9th Mississauga Horse. This was a reference to the First Nation that inhabited the area before the Europeans, the Mississaugas.

The 9th Mississauga Horse contributed many volunteers to the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I, in particular to the 75th Battalion and the 170th (Mississauga Horse) Battalion, CEF.

In 1920 the regiment was renamed The Ontario Mounted Rifles and in 1924 it was renamed The Mississauga Horse. The regimental march was &quot;John Peel&quot;.

On 15 December 1936, as part of the 1936 Canadian Militia Reorganization, the regiment was amalgamated with The Governor General&#x27;s Body Guard to form The Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards, an armoured militia (i.e., part-time reservist) regiment, which still exists today as part of 32 Canadian Brigade Group in Toronto.

<text>Georg Karl Julius Hackenschmidt ( – 19 February 1968) was an Estonian strongman, amateur and professional wrestler, writer, and sports philosopher who is recognized as professional wrestling&#x27;s first world heavyweight champion.
Hackenschmidt began his professional career in Tallinn (Reval), Estonia (then part of the Russian Empire), and after a 1899 tournament in Paris was often referred in the media by the moniker &quot;The Russian Lion&quot;. He lived most of his middle age and later life in London, England. 

He is believed to be the creator of the professional wrestling version of the bear hug as well as the person who popularised the hack squat; additionally, Hackenschmidt is also attributed as the creator of the bench press. He was known for his impressive strength, fitness, and flexibility. Later in life, he wrote many books on physical culture, training and philosophy.

== Early life ==

Georg Hackenschmidt was born in Tartu (Dorpat), Estonia, on 1 August 1877, where he lived with his parents, Baltic German Georg Friedrich Heinrich Hackenschmidt (born 1847) and Ida Louise Johansson, who was of Estonian and Swedish descent. He had a younger brother, Bruno, and sister Alice. He later said that neither of his parents were particularly robust in stature or had any unusual physical characteristics, though his maternal grandfather was said to have been a huge and powerful man. His paternal grandfather, Christian Philipp Hackenschmidt, a Prussian dyer, accepted Russian citizenship with his wife in 1845; he died about 1881–1882.

From his earliest years, Hackenschmidt devoted himself to physical development, particularly at the local Real school (&quot;Dorpater Realschule&quot;), where he took advantage of the gym. He excelled in &quot;gorodki&quot;, cycling, gymnastics, swimming, running, jumping and weightlifting. His feats of strength astounded his teachers, as he could lift a small horse off the ground and lift 276 pounds overhead one handed. In a wrestler&#x27;s bridge, he could pull a 335-pound barbell from the floor to his chest and press it overhead, bridging on his neck. He set several records in weight lifting and was considered both the strongest and the best-developed man in the world.

Graduating from school in 1895, he started working at a large engineering factory in Tallinn (Reval) as a blacksmith&#x27;s apprentice. He joined the city&#x27;s Athletic and Cycling Club, becoming an ardent cyclist and winning prizes, but also developed a keen interest in wrestling and weight lifting. The turning point in his life came in 1896 when another Estonian, Georg Lurich, a Greco-Roman wrestler and strongman, toured in Tallinn with a small troupe, challenging any and all comers. Hackenschmidt took up the challenge and was beaten. German wrestler Fritz Konietzko came to Tallinn in 1897, and Hackenschmidt fared better.

== Professional wrestling career ==

In late 1897-early 1898, Hackenschmidt suffered a minor hand injury at the factory and consulted a doctor who was acquainted with Dr. Vladislav Krajewski, who was in the service of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Krajewski was the founder of the Saint Petersburg Athletic and Cycling Club, with Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich as president. While observing Hackenschmidt&#x27;s arm, Krajewski noticed the athlete&#x27;s physique and invited him to Saint Petersburg and offered to stay with him, as he saw in him the potential to become a professional wrestler. Krajewski trained Georg Lurich for some time and told Hackenschmidt that he had the potential to become the strongest man in the world.

Despite his parents&#x27; objections, Hackenschmidt left for Saint Petersburg in the spring of 1898. In 1898, Hackenschmidt trained at Krajewski&#x27;s and was supported by Count Georges de Ribeaupierre. In April, the club organized a competition in weightllifting for the title of Russian champion, which Hackenschmidt won. In late April, in Saint Petersburg he defeated the French wrestler Paul Pons in 45 minutes. In preparation to performing in front of an audience, Krajewski sent Hackenschmidt to Riga, where he performed under an assumed name as a weightlifter and wrestler. During this period Hackenschmidt still noted his lack of wrestling technique, which he made up for with strength. In the summer of 1898, Hackenschmidt travelled to Vienna to compete at the World Weightlifting Championships and European Wrestling Championships, which were held together. The weightlifting championships were a decathlon (ten events consisting of: one-hand snatch, simultaneous press of two dumbbells, simultaneous jerk of two dumbbells, one-hand press in military style, one-hand press in straddling style, one-hand press continuously in military style with 50.2 kg, one hand press continuously in straddling style with 50.2 kg, two-hand press, two-hand jerk, and two-hand press continuously in military style with 100 kg), with Hackenschmidt taking third place overall. The wrestling championships were an openweight competition in the Greco-Roman style, with Hackenschmidt winning the championship.

In January 1899, he had to serve in the army: he was assigned to the Preobrazhensky Regiment. Demobilized five months later, on May 16 of that year Hackenschmidt defeated Alexander von Schmelling in a fight for the title of Russian champion of 1899. On 19 May he defeated von Schmelling again and was crowned Russian champion of 1899. In September, despite an arm injury, Hackenschmidt travelled to Paris for the World Wrestling Championships. There he received his moniker, &quot;The Russian Lion&quot;. After a few matches, he aggravated the injury and went home. Doctors treated him electrically for six months, but it did more harm than good.

In May 1900 Hackenschmidt returned to weight training. In July 1900, Hackenschmidt took part in a forty-day wrestling tournament in Moscow, making his first appearance as a professional wrestler in Russia. He competed for two prizes, and won both, becoming champion of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. During the tournament he competed almost daily against 3-5 opponents. At the Chemnitz tournament, Hackenschmidt met Lurich for the first time in his professional career. According to Hackenschmidt&#x27;s memories, Lurich bragged widely about his former victories over him. This led Georg to challenge Lurich to a match, which he usually never did. When Hackenschmidt took the stage, Lurich ran backstage. The next morning Lurich left Chemnitz.

In March 1901, Hackenschmidt suffered the death of his mentor Krajewski, whom he considered his second father. On 30 November 1901, the World Championship of Wrestling opened at the Casino de Paris with 130 wrestlers. Hackenschmidt won first place, received two gold medals (for the lightweight tournament and the heavyweight tournament) and 3000 francs. After that Georg went to the town of Alsleben to the trainer Siebert, who helped him to gain weight, which dropped due to the heavy schedule. During this time, he jumped 100 times over a table with his feet tied together. He won tournaments everywhere he wrestled, and toured England in 1903 managed by the flamboyant C. B. Cochran to confront the country&#x27;s best wrestlers in the catch-as-catch-can style which was regaining popularity. They created a music hall boom in professional wrestling, and Hackenschmidt became a major superstar and drawing card. He wrestled in opera halls, music halls and theaters. As the wrestling boom took hold in England and wrestlers came in from all around the world for the grand tournaments that had become the rage, he remained the dominant grappler, defeating every man he met. Cochran polished his act until Hackenschmidt was a major attraction. He might take on five wrestlers in the same evening, defeating them all.

Handsome as well as powerfully built, Hackenschmidt was adored by women and admired by men. Personally a soft-spoken, cultured and intellectual young man, he could speak seven languages fluently and became a noted author, speaker and philosopher. United States President Theodore Roosevelt, himself a proponent of physical culture and exercise, proclaimed, &quot;If I wasn&#x27;t president of the United States, I would like to be George Hackenschmidt&quot;.

Hackenschmidt continued touring England and defeated the local favorites Tom Cannon, Tom Connors, Tom MacInerney, Jack Baldwin and Tom Clayton. However, when he defeated the Italian Antonio Pieri twice, Pieri sought revenge by trying to find a wrestler who could beat him. He thought he had found such a man in Ahmed Madrali, called the &quot;Terrible Turk&quot;, who faced Hackenschmidt at the Olympia London on 30 January 1904. Because of all the ballyhoo, the Olympia was packed and traffic was jammed from the Olympia back to Piccadilly. Hackenschmidt picked up Madrali and threw him down onto his arm, dislocating his shoulder. The contest had lasted about two minutes.

On 2 July at the Royal Albert Hall, Hackenschmidt faced the American heavyweight champion Tom Jenkins, a wrestler who would prove to be Hackenschmidt&#x27;s toughest opponent to date, under Greco-Roman rules. Nevertheless, he pinned Jenkins in two straight falls. Hackenschmidt left Cochran&#x27;s management to tour Australia where he defeated the Australian Cornish wrestling champion Deli Nelson in 1905, amongst others. He then sailed to the United States for an extended tour and a rematch with Jenkins at the Madison Square Garden under catch-as-catch-can rules, which Hackenschmidt by now preferred. Jenkins put up a hard battle, but Hackenschmidt again won in two straight falls, the first in 31 minutes, 14 seconds, and the second in 22 minutes, 4 seconds. He was declared the inaugural World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion and subsequently most major league US versions of this title in the 20th and 21st centuries trace their roots back to this match. He then wrestled in Canada and returned to England for a long list of music hall engagements.

On October 28, 1905, Hackenschmidt faced Scottish champion Alexander Munro at the Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow with an audience of 16,000. Munro was 7 cm taller and 5.5 kg heavier. Heavy rain throughout the performance hindered both wrestlers. The first fall ended after 40 minutes and 22 seconds when Munro surrendered from a half nelson. Ten minutes later, the second bout began, which Hackenschmidt successfully finished in 11 minutes, 11 seconds. For the next 6 months, Hackenschmidt performed in music halls, after which he agreed to a rematch with &quot;Terrible Turk&quot; Madrali by catch wrestling rules to show the English public that the first victory was no accident. He took extra catch lessons from Jack Gromley at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. Hackenschmidt defeated Madrali at the Olympia London in just four minutes, but noted that the Turk was one of the toughest men he had ever faced.

He then sailed to the United States to fulfill his obligation to meet a new challenger from Iowa by the name of Frank Gotch.

=== Rivalry with Frank Gotch ===

Wrestling historian Mike Chapman wrote &quot;In all of athletic history, there are a mere handful of rivalries between individual stars that have become almost as large as the sport itself. In boxing, such matchups as Sullivan–Corbett, Dempsey–Tunney, Louis–Conn and Ali–Frazier are a part of boxing folklore. In wrestling, there is only one: Gotch–Hackenschmidt&quot;.

After defeating Jenkins in 1905, Hackenschmidt held the world title and remained undefeated until he and Frank Gotch finally squared off on 3 April 1908, at the Dexter Park Pavilion in Chicago. Showing his contempt for Gotch and for American wrestling in general, Hackenschmidt was not in the best condition. Refusing to train publicly at the Chicago Athletic Club in spite of arrangements having been made for him to do so, he was barred from the club and spent his time either in his hotel room or taking long morning and evening walks along Lake Michigan. By neglecting his training, he lost his endurance, which had never been a factor in his previous matches because he ended them so quickly. Against Gotch, who was in peak condition, it would be decisive.

Gotch used his speed, defense and rough tactics to wear the champion down and then assume the attack. The wrestlers stood on their feet for two full hours before Gotch was able to get behind Hackenschmidt and take him down. While on their feet, Gotch made sure to lean on Hackenschmidt to wear him down. He bullied him around the ring, and his thumbing and butting left Hackenschmidt covered in blood. At one time, Gotch also punched Hackenschmidt on the nose. Hackenschmidt complained to the referee of Gotch&#x27;s foul tactics and asked that Gotch be forced to take a hot shower to rid his body of an abundance of oil, but the referee ignored the complaints and told Hackenschmidt he should have noticed the oil before the match began. The match continued until the two-hour mark, when Hackenschmidt was forced against the ropes. Gotch tore him off the ropes, threw him down and rode him hard for three minutes, working for his dreaded toe hold. Hackenschmidt had trained to avoid this hold, which he did, but the effort took his last remaining strength. Hackenschmidt quit the fall. &quot;I surrender the championship of the world to Mr. Gotch&quot;, he said, and stood up and shook Gotch&#x27;s hand. The wrestlers then retired to their dressing rooms before coming out for the second fall, but Hackenschmidt refused to return to the ring, telling the referee to declare Gotch the winner, thereby relinquishing his title to him. Although he at first called Gotch &quot;the greatest man by far I ever met&quot;, and explained how his muscles had become stale and his feet had given out, and that he knew he could not win and therefore conceded the match, Hackenschmidt later reversed his opinion of Gotch and Americans in general, claiming to have been fouled by Gotch and victimized in America, and calling for a rematch in Europe.

In August 1907, Hackenschmidt suffered pain in his knee and returned to Russia for rehabilitation. Hackenschmidt failed to heal his knee and was sent back to England. By 1907 the situation in the wrestling world had changed, Hackenschmidt noticed the emergence of four strong wrestlers: Constant Le Marin, Stanislaus Zbyszko, Ivan Poddubny and Joe Rogers. All four challenged Hackenschmidt, and he agreed to compete against the strongest of them, which should determine the tournament. In England, Hackenschmidt attended a match between Zbyszko and Poddubny, which Zbyszko won. Rogers was unable to compete due to sepsis and demanded a rematch from Hackenschmidt for the loss in USA. The contest was held on February 6, 1908, at Oxford Music Hall, where Hackenschmidt defeated Rogers in a short bout. Hackenschmidt was then scheduled to face Zbyszko, but the match was canceled due to knee problems. The wrestler went to Aachen, where he underwent knee surgery, followed by a long recovery. During his rehabilitation, Hackenschmidt wrote that the only opponent he was interested in was Frank Gotch.

Hackenschmidt and Gotch met again on 4 September 1911, at the newly opened Comiskey Park in Chicago, which drew a crowd of nearly 30,000 spectators and a record gate of $87,000. The rematch is one of the most controversial and talked about matches in professional wrestling history, as Hackenschmidt claimed to have injured his knee against Dr. Roller, his chief training partner. Years later, professional wrestler Ad Santel told Lou Thesz that he was paid $5,000 by Gotch&#x27;s backers to cripple Hackenschmidt in training, and make it look like an accident. However, according to Hackenschmidt himself, the injury was accidentally inflicted by his sparring partner, Roller, when trying to hold Hackenschmidt down onto his knees in the down position. Roller&#x27;s right foot struck Hackenschmidt&#x27;s right knee, which in 1904 had developed &quot;Housemaid&#x27;s Knee&quot;, requiring treatment, and had acted up again in 1907. Furthermore, according to Hackenschmidt, his sparring partners for this match were Americus (Gus Schoenlein), Jacobus Koch, Wladek Zbyszko and Roller. Ad Santel is not mentioned in any account of Hackenschmidt&#x27;s training by either Hackenschmidt or Roller, both of whom offered their insights and accounts.

Whatever the case may be, Dr. Roller did not consider the injury to be serious, and referee Ed Smith dismissed it as inconsequential. Hackenschmidt himself ignored it completely in declaring, the day before the match, that he was &quot;fit to wrestle for my life&quot; and was &quot;satisfied with my condition and confident of the outcome&quot;. However, Gotch, tearing into Hackenschmidt with a vengeance, discovered the weakness quickly and took advantage of it. Hackenschmidt was easy prey for Gotch, losing in straight falls in only 20 minutes. Gotch clinched the match with his signature toe hold, which forced Hackenschmidt to concede.

== Retirement and writing career ==
Following his second defeat at the hands of Gotch, upon returning to England, Hackenschmidt was preparing for a match with Stanislaus Zbyszko to take place the following June, but when he began working out he felt such pain in his right knee that it was painful even to walk. It necessitated surgery, but Hackenschmidt decided at that point to retire and pursue his other interests in philosophy, physical culture and gardening.

Hackenschmidt was a pioneer in the field of weightlifting. He invented the exercise known as the hack squat, whose name is a reference to his own. Hackenschmidt also helped to popularize many other types of lifts common within the modern training regimen, such as the bench press. During his career, he established numerous weightlifting records, which were improved upon by others in ensuing decades.

Hackenschmidt was an educated man who spoke seven languages. He went on to write books, including &quot;Complete Science of Wrestling&quot; (1909), &quot;Man and Cosmic Antagonism to Mind and Spirit&quot; (1935), &quot;Fitness and Your Self&quot; (1937), &quot;Consciousness and Character: True Definitions of Entity, Individuality, Personality, Nonentity&quot; (1937), &quot;The Way to Live in Health and Physical Fitness&quot; (1941), and &quot;The Three Memories and Forgetfulness: What They Are and What Their True Significance Is in Human Life&quot;. He also taught physical education to members of the House of Lords and served as a judge at the 1948 Mr. Universe show in London won by John Grimek.

His book &quot;Man and Cosmic Antagonism to Mind and Spirit&quot; was the personal philosophy he developed while interned as a prisoner-of-war in Germany.

Hackenschmidt was already hospitalized at St. Francis Hospital in Dulwich, a suburb of London, when he died on 19 February 1968. He was 89 years old. He was cremated at West Norwood Cemetery, where his memorial plaque records him as George Hackenschmidt.

== Personal life ==
During World War I, Hackenschmidt was interned by the German Empire authorities in Berlin with his wife. His brother Bruno, who was also a wrestler, was also captured in Germany and died in captivity. During World War II, he lived with his wife in the family home in the south of France.

Hackenschmidt became a naturalized French citizen in 1939, and then became a British subject in 1946. He lived with his French wife Rachel in South Norwood, London.

He was a friend of the magician Harry Houdini and playwright George Bernard Shaw. As he aged, Hackenschmidt also expressed a high regard for his old opponent, Tom Jenkins, by then the wrestling coach at the US Military Academy at West Point. Hack visited Jenkins in 1939 and the two got along splendidly, with Jenkins accommodating Hackenschmidt in his home and giving him a tour of the West Point training facilities. In their mutual admiration society, they never publicly expressed any credit to Frank Gotch, and Hackenschmidt spent the rest of his life complaining about Gotch&#x27;s foul tactics and his knee injury in explaining his &quot;inexplicable&quot; losses. After Yury Vlasov won and set a world record at the London tournament in July 1961, George Hackenschmidt gave him the medal and presented Vlasov his picture with a dedicatory inscription.

=== Diet ===

Throughout his life, Hackenschmidt paid strict attention to his diet. He abstained from alcohol, coffee and tobacco and advised moderation in sexual intercourse.
In 1925, Charles B. Cochran recounted that he once invited Hackenschmidt to dine at his flat in Piccadilly. Cochran noted that Hackenschmidt ate &quot;eight or nine eggs, a porterhouse-steak, and a whole Camembert cheese&quot;. Journalist Maurice Richardson commented that Hackenschmidt was a considerable meat eater during the height of his wrestling career and would eat steak and half a dozen eggs as a snack but did not eat tinned foods. In opposition to this, historian Ina Zweiniger-Bargielowska has suggested that during his career in the ring Hackenschmidt promoted a largely vegetarian diet of &quot;fresh, uncooked food and nuts&quot;, and sportswriter Lew Freedman has written that Hackenschmidt rarely ate meat and did not like cooked food.

Hackenschmidt is alleged to have written that he consumed eleven pints of milk a day for training. However, this was later disputed. Hackenschmidt told Atholl Oakeley that the quantity of milk prescribed had been a misprint. After retiring from the ring, Hackenschmidt became a strict vegetarian. In &quot;The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy&quot;, it stated that Hackenschmidt developed a &quot;system of philosophy based on the values of spirituality, vegetarianism and self-control.&quot; His vegetarian diet of fresh uncooked foods avoided &quot;everything which has been artificialised in any way&quot;.

He remained physically fit well into old age, and at 56 he could jump over a 4-foot, 6-inch high board ten times. Even through his mid-80s, he would jump fifty times over a chair once a week, bench press 150 pounds and run seven miles in 45 minutes.

== Wrestling style and persona ==
In his entire professional wrestling career, Hackenschmidt engaged in about 3,000 matches, losing only two. Powerfully built, Hackenschmidt&#x27;s measurements for his 1905 match with Alexander Munro were: age – 28; weight – 204 pounds; height – 5′, 9½″; reach – 75″; biceps – 19″; forearm – 15½″; neck – 22″; chest – 52″; waist – 34″; thigh – 26¾″; calf – 18″. He also rose to prominence when the governing style of wrestling was the slower, more ponderous Greco-Roman style that emphasized muscle power over speed, agility and ring generalship, and involved holds only above the waist. Being bulkier of build than his leaner opponents, Hackenschmidt&#x27;s style and temperament were not geared as much to the catch-as-catch-can style. Hackenschmidt was a natural showman, he was honest, straightforward and serious, and he would finish off his opponents quickly. His manager C. B. Cochran had to convince him to extend his matches and put on a show, which in turn ensured more bookings and sold-out shows. This did not mean the matches were fake, as excluding exhibitions, his matches were all on the level, but he might allow a local wrestler to last ten minutes and collect his £25 prize, and set up a highly publicized match for later in the week, where he would defeat his foe handily. Unlike many other professional wrestlers, including Frank Gotch, Hackenschmidt was never mean, vindictive or unnecessarily rough in the ring, &quot;contrasting his physical prowess and fighting skills with a quietness of spirit&quot;, David Gentle explained. &quot;George Hackenschmidt was the epitome of calm, self-assurance and inner peace, with full awareness of his own capabilities and thus like all masters of combat found no need for machoism or outward aggression. His tactic to win was skill and speed, born of confidence in his own ability and fighting prowess&quot;. However, he had three weaknesses. Against a first-class opponent, of whom he faced extremely few, he could be slow to adapt. Gotch reported after their first match that &quot;every move the Russian made he telegraphed me in advance, which shows that he thinks too slowly&quot;.

Hackenschmidt was also given to depression and irascibility. When he came to Chicago to train for his first match with Gotch, promoter Jack Curley had arranged for Hackenschmidt to work out every day before a paying public, which Hackenschmidt refused to do. Barred from the athletic club, he spent his time before the match either exercising in his room or taking morning and evening walks along Lake Michigan, but no serious workouts. The more depressed he got, the more difficult he was to work with, and this all worked against him because, for the first time in his professional career, Hackenschmidt faced a foe fully capable of defeating him. Finally, and worst of all, in both matches with Gotch, Hackenschmidt was accused of lack of heart. Referee Ed Smith, following the 1908 match, said that &quot;deep down in my own mind, I decided that George Hackenschmidt had quit – quit quite cold, as a matter of fact – because there was nothing about Gotch&#x27;s treatment of him in that first encounter that could by a stretch of the imagination call for a disqualification. There was some face-mauling, just as there always is ... but at no time did the vaunted Hackenschmidt ever make a serious move toward slapping down his opponent, never showed much in the wrestling line during the entire two hours... Again, I say, that as the referee of that match, I thought that the &#x27;Russian Lion&#x27; quit&quot;. Following the 1911 rematch, one newspaper described Gotch&#x27;s easy victory and then added that &quot;in the parlance of the sporting world, Hackenschmidt is yellow ... He quit when his position became dangerous&quot;. Perhaps the most frustrated was Hackenschmidt&#x27;s second, Dr. Benjamin Roller, who himself had lost several times to Gotch, but had displayed the utmost gameness and courage. &quot;Hack did not get started&quot;, Roller explained. &quot;That&#x27;s largely a matter of gameness&quot;. Hackenschmidt&#x27;s injuries had not been serious enough, Roller felt. &quot;I have tried my best to make a winner out of him and put him into the ring in the best possible condition, but ... gameness is something you can not put into a man&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The years spanning Hackenschmidt&#x27;s professional career are called the Golden Age of professional wrestling. Not only were professional wrestling matches more widely believed to be honestly contested, but wrestling was the most popular sport on every continent. However, it was Hackenschmidt&#x27;s showmanship that made professional wrestling arguably the most popular sport in the United Kingdom at the time, and it was he and Gotch together who brought it to entirely new heights around the world. &quot;The Hackenschmidt-Gotch matches were the pinnacle of professional wrestling during the time period and received much attention from media, fans, and celebrities&quot;, Andrew Malnoske observed. &quot;They were even described in the 1937 book &quot;Fall Guys – The Barnums of Bounce&quot; by famed writer Marcus Griffen. To this day, the Chicago Public Library receives requests to view the newspaper accounts and files on the bouts.&quot; As Mark Palmer pointed out, &quot;For starters, George Hackenschmidt and Frank Gotch were major sports superstars of the early 20th century. Fans of all ages collected cabinet cards and postcards with their images, read their books, and devoured articles about them in newspapers. Their epic matches were front-page news around the world – akin to today&#x27;s World Cup in terms of garnering global attention – and helped to launch organized amateur wrestling in the United States in the early part of the 20th century. In fact, a large number of high school and college wrestling programs can trace their roots back to the 1910s and 1920s – the era when Hackenschmidt and Gotch were still household names, and highly respected athletes&quot;.

Having already made his mark in bodybuilding, Hackenschmidt caused the major surge in the popularity of professional wrestling in England, and he was considered unbeatable. However, Hackenschmidt probably would not be so well remembered today were it not for two things: 1) his enormous standing in the world of physical culture, and 2) his two defeats at the hands of Frank Gotch. Hackenschmidt remained in the public eye because he had become an icon in the world of physical culture, a legendary bodybuilder as well as health addict, and a world champion wrestler central to a movement that was now increasingly popular. He spoke and published widely on a wide range of subjects, but most notably on health and fitness. His most popular book was the classic &quot;The Way To Live&quot;, the last words of which read, &quot;Throughout my whole career I have never bothered as to whether I was a champion or not a champion; The only title I have desired to be known by is simply my name – George Hackenschmidt&quot;. However, it was his matches with Gotch that ensured the growing popularity of catch-as-catch-can wrestling over the more laborious Greco-Roman that had previously dominated, and this is the style that enjoys popularity at all scholastic levels, private clubs and the Olympics to this day. Hackenschmidt was a major reason for this.

The H. J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports at the Todd-McLean Library and Special Collections in Austin, Texas, has a digitized version of a nearly 600-page scrapbook owned for decades by Hackenschmidt and bequeathed by his widow Rachel. The international Georg Hackenschmidt Memorial in Greco-Roman wrestling has been held in Tartu since 1969.
