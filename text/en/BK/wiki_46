<text>Gremlins is a 1984 American black comedy horror film directed by Joe Dante, written by Chris Columbus and starring Zach Galligan, Phoebe Cates, Hoyt Axton, Polly Holliday and Frances Lee McCain, with Howie Mandel providing the voice of Gizmo the &quot;mogwai&quot;. It draws on legends of folkloric mischievous creatures that cause malfunctions—&quot;gremlins&quot;—in the British Royal Air Force going back to World War II. The story follows Billy Peltzer, who receives Gizmo as a pet, who then spawns more of his kind that evolve into the titular imp-like monsters that wreak havoc on Billy&#x27;s hometown during Christmas Eve.

The film was accompanied by a large merchandising campaign and juxtaposes black comedy with a Christmastime setting. Steven Spielberg was the film&#x27;s executive producer, with the film being produced by Michael Finnell.

This film uses black comedy to spoof multiple genres, particularly family films, Christmas movies and classic B-movie monster horror.

&quot;Gremlins&quot; was theatrically released on June 8, 1984, by Warner Bros. to critical and commercial success. However, it was heavily criticized for some of its more violent sequences. In response to this and to similar complaints about &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, Spielberg suggested that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) alter its rating system, which it did within two months of the film&#x27;s release, creating a new PG-13 rating. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; (1990).

== Plot ==

Struggling inventor Randall Peltzer visits a Chinatown antique store to find a Christmas present for his son, Billy. In it, Randall uncovers a small and furry creature called a (Cantonese: , &#x27;devil&#x27;). The owner, Mr. Wing, refuses to sell it to Randall, but his grandson secretly does, warning Randall to remember three important rules concerning the &quot;mogwai&quot; – do not expose the creature to light, especially sunlight, which will kill it; do not let it come in contact with water; and above all, never let it eat after midnight.

In Randall&#x27;s hometown of Kingston Falls, Billy works at the local bank, but fears that his dog Barney will be put down by widowed miser Ruby Deagle. His father returns and offers him the &quot;mogwai&quot;, now named &quot;Gizmo&quot;, as a pet, and informs him of the rules. Gizmo is friendly and docile, but when Billy&#x27;s friend, Pete Fountaine, accidentally spills water on Gizmo, five more &quot;mogwai&quot; spawn from him – a more mischievous sort led by the aggressive Stripe, named after the white mohawk-like tuft of fur on his head. Billy shows one of the &quot;mogwai&quot; to his former elementary school science teacher, Roy Hanson, spawning another &quot;mogwai&quot;, whom the latter experiments on. Back at home, Stripe and his fellow &quot;mogwai&quot; trick Billy into feeding them after midnight by severing the power cord on his bedside clock. They form cocoons, as does Hanson&#x27;s &quot;mogwai&quot;, which soon hatch, emerging as destructive and reptilian imp-like monsters called &quot;gremlins&quot;. Hanson is murdered by his gremlin, while those at the Peltzer house torture Gizmo and assault Billy&#x27;s mother, Lynn.

She and Billy are able to dispatch all the gremlins except for Stripe, who escapes to the local YMCA where he jumps into its swimming pool, spawning an army of gremlins that wreak havoc on Kingston Falls. Many locals are injured or outright killed during their rampage, including Deagle. The police are helpless in the ordeal, as they too fall victim to the gremlins&#x27; mischief. After Billy rescues his co-worker and girlfriend, Kate Beringer, and they seek refuge in the bank, the latter discloses that her father went missing on Christmas Eve when she was nine years old, but was then found dead in their house&#x27;s chimney several days later. Planning to surprise his family while portraying Santa Claus, he inadvertently slipped and broke his neck while climbing down the chimney. Still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder due to the incident, Kate confesses how this led to her disdain for the holidays.

The trio find the gremlins gathered in the local movie theater due to morning approaching and set off a natural gas explosion, killing them all except for Stripe, who left the theater earlier to retrieve candy at a Montgomery Ward store across the street. They soon follow Stripe into the store, where he attempts to use a fountain to spawn more gremlins, but Gizmo then opens a nearby skylight, exposing Stripe to sunlight and killing him.

As the local news reports on the day&#x27;s mysterious tragedies, Mr. Wing arrives at the Peltzer house to reclaim Gizmo. He scolds the family for their negligence and criticizes Western society for its carelessness with nature. However, as he turns to leave, Gizmo, having bonded with Billy, bids him goodbye. A compassionate Wing then concedes that Billy may be ready to properly care for him one day.

== Cast ==
The film features various cameos from crew members or guests. Steven Spielberg cameos as a man riding a recumbent bicycle; Jim McKrell plays Lew Landers; composer Jerry Goldsmith plays a man in a phone booth; Kenneth Tobey plays a smoking gas station attendant; and William Schallert plays Father Bartlett. Animator Chuck Jones plays Mr. Jones, Billy&#x27;s drawing mentor; he would later create the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;-centric segments for the sequel, &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; (1990).

== Production ==

=== Background ===
&quot;Gremlins&quot; was produced at a time when combining horror and comedy was becoming increasingly popular. According to Professor Noël Carroll, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, released the same weekend as &quot;Gremlins&quot;, and the comic strip &quot;The Far Side&quot; also followed this trend. Carroll argued that there was now a new genre emphasizing sudden shifts between humorous and horrific scenes, drawing laughs with plot elements that have been traditionally used to scare.

The notion of gremlins was first conceived during the 1920s when mechanical failures in RAF aircraft were jokingly blamed on the small monsters. The term &quot;gremlins&quot; also entered popular culture as children&#x27;s author and RAF pilot Roald Dahl published a book called &quot;The Gremlins&quot; in 1943, based on the mischievous creatures. Walt Disney considered making a film of it. A Bugs Bunny cartoon of the era, &quot;Falling Hare&quot;, shows Bugs battling a gremlin on an airplane. Joe Dante had read &quot;The Gremlins&quot; and said that the book was of some influence on his film. In 1983, Dante publicly distanced his work from earlier films, explaining, &quot;Our gremlins are somewhat different—they&#x27;re sort of green, and they have big mouths, and they smile a lot and they do incredibly, really nasty things to people and enjoy it all the while&quot;.

=== Development ===

The story of &quot;Gremlins&quot; was conceived by Chris Columbus. As Columbus explained, his inspiration came from his loft, when at night &quot;what sounded like a platoon of mice would come out and to hear them skittering around in the blackness was really creepy&quot;. He then wrote the original screenplay as a spec script to show potential employers that he had writing abilities. The story was not actually intended to be filmed until Steven Spielberg took an interest in turning it into a film. As Spielberg explained, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the most original things I&#x27;ve come across in many years, which is why I bought it.&quot; Spielberg considered Tim Burton to direct the film after seeing his short film &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;.

After deciding to executive produce the film himself, Spielberg chose Dante as his director because of his experience with horror-comedy; Dante had previously directed &quot;The Howling&quot;; however, in the time between &quot;The Howling&quot; and the offer to film &quot;Gremlins&quot;, he had experienced a lull in his career. Dante began doing storyboard work on the film while also working as a director on &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983), a film on which Spielberg also served as a director. The film&#x27;s producer was Michael Finnell, who had also worked on &quot;The Howling&quot; with Dante. Spielberg took the project to Warner Bros. and co-produced it through his own company, Amblin Entertainment.

Designer Chris Walas spoke on the creation of the initial concept of the creatures, “After reading the script, my first idea was to take the tarsier, a little primate, and give it cartoony proportions. I wanted the big eyes to make it cute. I showed it to Mike Finnell and Joe Dante and they asked for some tweaks, so I made the next one. This is more like a puppy. Big, floppy ears. It’s not based on any one dog in particular — just a Cocker Spaniel or something. Fortunately they did not go with it. These were the only two Mogwai I sculpted before the final one.”

The film&#x27;s script went through a few drafts before a shooting script was finalized. The first version was much darker than the final film. Various scenes were cut, including one which portrayed Billy&#x27;s mother being decapitated during her struggle with the gremlins, with her head thrown down the stairs when Billy arrives. Dante later explained the scene made the film darker than the filmmakers wanted. There was also a scene where the gremlins ate Billy&#x27;s dog and a scene where the gremlins attacked a McDonald&#x27;s, eating customers instead of burgers. Also, instead of Stripe being a &quot;mogwai&quot; who becomes a gremlin, there was originally no &quot;mogwai&quot; named Stripe; rather, Gizmo was supposed to transform into Stripe the gremlin. Spielberg overruled this plot element as he felt Gizmo was cute and that audiences would want him to be present throughout the film.

The film mentions an urban legend in which Kate reveals in a speech that her father died at Christmas when he dressed as Santa Claus and broke his neck while climbing down the family&#x27;s chimney. After the film was completed, studio executives insisted upon its removal, because they felt it was too ambiguous as to whether it was supposed to be funny or sad. Dante refused to take the scene out, saying it represented the film as a whole, which had a combination of horrific and comedic elements. Spielberg did not like the scene but, despite his creative control, he viewed &quot;Gremlins&quot; as Dante&#x27;s project and allowed him to leave it in. A parody of this scene is featured in &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot;.

=== Casting ===

Phoebe Cates was cast as Kate, Billy&#x27;s girlfriend, despite concerns that she was known for playing more risqué parts, such as Linda Barrett in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982). Spielberg urged the casting of the relatively unknown Zach Galligan as Billy because he saw chemistry between Galligan and Cates during auditions. Galligan later compared himself to Billy, saying he was a &quot;geeky kid&quot;, and that being in the film &quot;was really kind of a dream&quot; given &quot;what I get to do, what my character gets to do, blow up movie theatres&quot;, adding that he &quot;got to work with great people&quot;. Spielberg commented when Galligan was testing with Cates that &quot;he&#x27;s in love with her already&quot; and that was how Galligan won the part. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Ralph Macchio, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe and Judd Nelson also auditioned.

In contrast to Galligan, many of the supporting actors and actresses were better known. Veteran actor Glynn Turman portrayed the high school science teacher whose study of a newborn &quot;mogwai&quot; leads to his death after it forms a cocoon and emerges as a vicious gremlin. Dick Miller, who was a regular in Dante&#x27;s films, was another experienced actor on the set, playing a World War II veteran who first refers to the creatures as gremlins. Rand was played by Hoyt Axton, who was always the filmmakers&#x27; preferred choice for the role even though it was widely contested by other actors. Axton&#x27;s experience included acting as the father in &quot;The Black Stallion&quot; (1979), and he was also a country music singer-songwriter. After an introductory scene to &quot;Gremlins&quot; was cut, Axton&#x27;s voice earned him the added role of the narrator to establish some context. Mr. Wing was played by Keye Luke, a renowned film actor, whose film career spanned half a century. Although in reality he was around 80 at the time of filming, and his character was very elderly, Luke&#x27;s youthful appearance had to be covered by make-up.

Corey Feldman, who up to that time had primarily been in commercials, played Pete Fountaine, establishing his early credentials as a child actor; he previously met with Spielberg when he auditioned for &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Polly Holliday, an actress best known for her role in &quot;Alice&quot;, played Mrs. Deagle. Dante considered the casting fortunate, as she was well-known, and he considered her to be talented. Two other well-known actors, &quot;Fast Times&quot;″ Judge Reinhold and character actor Edward Andrews, received roles that were significantly reduced after the film was edited; they played Billy&#x27;s superiors at the bank. Tom Hanks also read for Gerald.

=== Special effects ===

Some of the performances were shot on the Courthouse Square and Colonial Street sets of the Universal Studios Lot in Universal City, California (Mrs. Deagle&#x27;s house was one such set as well as the opening street scenes in Chinatown, which were filmed on the Warner Bros. Studios backlot). This required fake snow; Dante also felt it was an atmosphere that would make the special effects more convincing.

An earlier attempt to use monkeys to interpret the gremlins was abandoned because the test monkey panicked when made to wear a gremlin head. Puppets and marionettes were used instead, so the actors worked alongside them in most scenes. Nevertheless, after the actors finished their work for good, a great deal of effort was spent finishing the effects.

Chris Walas designed numerous small rubber puppets to portray Gizmo and the gremlins. There was more than one Gizmo puppet, and occasionally Galligan, when carrying one, would set him down off camera, and when Gizmo appeared again sitting on a surface it was actually a different puppet wired to the surface. These puppets had many limitations. The Gizmo puppets were particularly frustrating because they were smaller and thus broke down more. While Walas recommended making the &quot;mogwai&quot; larger to make their creation and functioning easier for the special effects team, Dante insisted on keeping their size small to enhance the cuteness of the creatures. Consequently, to satisfy the crew, a scene was included in which the gremlins hang Gizmo on a wall and throw darts at him. This was included on a list that the crew created known to them as the &quot;Horrible Things to do to Gizmo&quot; list. Rob Bottin and John Dykstra were originally considered to do the special effects, Bottin was Dante&#x27;s first choice; but he was busy working on &quot;Legend&quot; (1985).

Other effects required large &quot;mogwai&quot; faces and ears to be produced for close-ups, as the puppets were less capable of conveying emotion. Consequently, large props simulating food were needed for the close-ups in the scene in which the &quot;mogwai&quot; feast after midnight. An enlarged Gizmo puppet was also needed for the scene in which he multiplies. The new &quot;mogwai&quot;, who popped out of Gizmo&#x27;s body as small, furry balls which then started to grow, were balloons and expanded as such. Walas had also created the exploding gremlin in the microwave by means of a balloon that was allowed to burst.

Howie Mandel provided the voice of Gizmo and prolific voice actor Frank Welker provided the voice of the gremlins&#x27; leader, Stripe. It was Welker who suggested Mandel perform in &quot;Gremlins&quot;. The puppets&#x27; lines were mostly invented by the voice actors, based on cues from the physical actions of the puppets, which were filmed before the voice work. When developing the voice for Gizmo, Mandel explained, &quot;[Gizmo was] cute and naive, so, you know, I got in touch with that... I couldn&#x27;t envision going any other way or do something different with it&quot;. The majority of the other gremlins&#x27; voices were performed by Michael Winslow and Peter Cullen, while the remaining voices were done by Mandel, Welker, Bob Bergen, Fred Newman, Jim Cummings, Sonny Melendrez, Mark Dodson, Bob Holt, Michael Sheehan and even Dante himself.

=== Music ===
The film&#x27;s score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith, who won a Saturn Award for Best Music for his efforts. The main score was composed with the objective of conveying &quot;the mischievous humor and mounting suspense of Gremlins&quot;. Goldsmith also wrote Gizmo&#x27;s song, which was hummed by Ilene Keys, a child actress and acquaintance of Goldsmith, rather than Mandel himself. Goldsmith also appears in the film, alongside Steven Spielberg, in the scene where Rand calls home from the salesman&#x27;s convention.

The soundtrack album was released by Geffen Records as a specially priced 7 cut mini-album on LP and cassette (Goldsmith&#x27;s music comprised all of side two) and reissued on compact disc in 1993 only in Germany.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===

Financially, &quot;Gremlins&quot; was a success. Produced on an $11 million budget, it was more expensive than Spielberg had originally intended but still relatively cheap for its time. The trailer introduced the film to audiences by briefly explaining that Billy receives a strange creature as a Christmas present, by going over the three rules, and then coming out with the fact that the creatures transform into terrible monsters. This trailer showed little of either the &quot;mogwai&quot; or the gremlins. In contrast to this, other advertisements concentrated on Gizmo, overlooked the gremlins, and made the film look similar to Spielberg&#x27;s earlier family film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982).

&quot;Gremlins&quot; was released into North American theaters on June 8, 1984, the same day as Ivan Reitman&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. &quot;Gremlins&quot; ranked second, with $12.5 million in its first weekend, $1.1 million less than &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. By the end of its American screenings on November 29, it had grossed $148,168,459 domestically. This made it the fourth highest-grossing film of the year, behind &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;. In August 1984, it opened in Argentina and Spain, and in October it premiered in West Germany. Screenings began in Mexico, Australia, and much of the rest of Europe in December. Since &quot;Gremlins&quot; had an international audience, different versions of the film were made to overcome cultural barriers. Mandel learned to speak his few intelligible lines, such as &quot;Bright light!&quot;, in various languages, including German. Regional music and humor were also incorporated into foreign-language versions. Dante credited this work as being one of the factors which helped to make &quot;Gremlins&quot; a worldwide success. However, many critics questioned the summer release date of the film in America, as the film takes place during the Christmas holiday season, causing them to comment that it should have had a Christmas release date instead.

In addition to this, there were also complaints from audiences about the violence depicted in the film. These complaints were particularly present in people who had brought their children to see the film, many of whom walked out of the theater before the film had ended. Dante admitted to reporters later that &quot;the idea of taking a 4-year-old to see &quot;Gremlins&quot;, thinking it&#x27;s going to be a cuddly, funny animal movie and then seeing that it turns into a horror picture, I think people were upset... They felt like they had been sold something family friendly and it wasn&#x27;t entirely family friendly&quot;.

The film became available to audiences again when it was brought back to theaters on August 30, 1985. This additional release brought its gross up to $153,083,102, making it Warner Bros.’ most successful film at the time, a record that stood until &quot;Batman&quot; surpassed it in 1989.

By February 1985, the film had grossed $59.6 million internationally, including $17 million in Japan. It grossed a further $0.2 million in 2019, taking its worldwide gross to over $212.9 million.

=== Critical response ===
Roger Ebert approved of the film, awarding it three out of four and declaring it to not only be &quot;fun&quot;, but also a &quot;sly series of send-ups&quot;, effectively parodying many elemental film storylines. In his opinion, &quot;Gremlins&quot; did this partly through depictions of mysterious worlds (the shop in Chinatown) and tyrannical elderly women (Mrs. Deagle). Ebert also believed the rule in which a &quot;mogwai&quot; cannot eat after midnight was inspired by fairy tales, and that the final scenes parody classic horror films. He connected Kate&#x27;s speech about her father with &quot;the great tradition of 1950s sick jokes&quot;. Gene Siskel gave the film three-and-a-half out of four, describing it as &quot;a wickedly funny and slightly sick ride&quot;, and &quot;a most original work. We&#x27;re aware at every moment that someone is trying to entertain us. Playfulness abounds.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was mixed, writing that the film &quot;is far more interested in showing off its knowledge of movie lore and making random jokes than in providing consistent entertainment. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s funniest when being most nasty.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; declared, &quot;Make room for adorable &#x27;Gremlins&#x27; dolls on the shelves and start counting the take for another calculated audience pleaser from the Steven Spielberg-Frank Marshall-Kathleen Kennedy team. But that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s here in this showy display of technical talent, otherwise nearly heedless of dramatic concerns.&quot; Leonard Maltin disapproved of the film, and his view was made clear in remarks he made on the television show &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. He called the film &quot;icky&quot; and &quot;gross&quot;. He later wrote that despite being set in a &quot;picture-postcard town&quot; and blending the feel of &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (a clip of which appears in &quot;Gremlins&quot;) with that of &quot;The Blob&quot;, the film is &quot;negated by too-vivid violence and mayhem&quot;; giving the film two out of four. Maltin later made a cameo appearance in &quot;Gremlins 2&quot;, repeating his criticisms of the original on film, as an in-joke, before being throttled by the creatures; he later gave the second film a more positive rating, three out of four.

While some critics criticized the film&#x27;s depictions of violence and greed—such as death scenes, Kate&#x27;s speech, and the gremlins&#x27; gluttony—for lacking comic value, scholar Charlotte Miller instead interpreted these as a satire of &quot;some characteristics of Western civilization&quot;, suggesting that Westerners may take too much satisfaction from violence. &quot;Gremlins&quot; can also be interpreted as a statement against technology, in that some characters, such as Billy&#x27;s father, are overly dependent on it. In contrast, Mr. Wing is shown to have a strong distaste for television. Kirkpatrick Sale also interpreted &quot;Gremlins&quot; as an anti-technology film in his book &quot;Rebels Against the Future&quot;. Another scholar suggested that the film is meant to express a number of observations of society by having the gremlin characters shift in what they are meant to represent. At different times, they are depicted as teenagers, the wealthy establishment, or fans of Disney films.

Another scholar drew a connection between the microwave scene and urban legends about pets dying in microwave ovens. He described the portrayal of this urban legend in the film as successful, but that meant it seemed terrible. This is indeed a scene that is thought of as being one of the film&#x27;s most violent depictions; with even Roger Ebert expressing some fear in his review that the film might encourage children to try similar things with their pets. Catherine Lester casts doubt on whether any children actually did attempt this as a result of seeing the film. Situating &quot;Gremlins&quot; in the children&#x27;s horror genre, she argues that child viewers are invited to identify with the gremlins themselves, whose rebellious behaviour may function as a source of subversive pleasure.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Gremlins&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Two or three good jokes, three or four neat scenes, lots of detail, but overall, a manic melee of pyrotechnics that made random grabs for my sympathy and failed to hold my attention, A bit more coherent thought, and who knows, it might have been something good.&quot;

&quot;Gremlins&quot; has been criticized for more than its depictions of violence. One BBC critic wrote in 2000 that &quot;The plot is thin and the pacing is askew&quot;. However, that critic also complimented the dark humour contrasted against the ideal Christmas setting. In 2002, another critic wrote that in hindsight, &quot;Gremlins&quot; has &quot;corny special effects&quot; and that the film will tend to appeal to children more so than to adults; he also said the acting was dull.

Despite the initial mixed criticism, &quot;Gremlins&quot; has continued to receive praise over the years and is considered by many critics to be one of the best films of 1984.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Whether you choose to see it as a statement on consumer culture or simply a special effects-heavy popcorn flick, &quot;Gremlins&quot; is a minor classic.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 70 based on 13 reviews.

=== Accolades ===
=== Home media ===
Warner Home Video released &quot;Gremlins&quot; on VHS, CED Videodisc, and Betamax on November 25, 1985. The film was released on DVD in 1997 in a bare bones presentation. It included both full screen and widescreen versions and the film&#x27;s trailer. It was repackaged in August, 1999 with the same disc, but a different cover. On August 20, 2002, a &quot;special edition&quot; DVD was released, which featured cast and filmmakers&#x27; commentary and deleted scenes. A 25th anniversary Blu-ray edition was released on December 1, 2009. The film was again released on home video in 4K Ultra HD on October 1, 2019.

The film grossed $15.2 million in home sales on DVD and Blu-Ray.

== Merchandising ==
=== Toys and collectibles ===
With its commercial themes, particularly the cuteness of the character Gizmo, &quot;Gremlins&quot; became the center of considerable merchandising. Due to this, it became part of a rising trend in film, which had received a boost from Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Manufacturers including LJN produced versions of Gizmo as dolls or stuffed animals, the latter of which became a popular high demand toy during the holiday season of 1984. Both Gizmo and the gremlins were mass-produced as action figures, and Topps printed trading cards based upon the film.

An interactive Gizmo Furby Friends toy was released in 1999.

A product placement deal with fast food chain Hardee&#x27;s also led to a series of five book-and-cassette/45 records adaptations of the film&#x27;s story. Starting in the early 2000s, companies such as Jun Planning and the National Entertainment Collectibles Association produced all-new Gremlins toys and collectibles. In 2017 Trick or Treat Studios began producing official Gremlins life-size puppets of Stripe and Gizmo. In May 2019, NECA unveiled their Christmas 2019 collectible, which features two Gremlins singing carols.

=== Novel ===
The screenplay was adapted into a novelization by George Gipe, published by Avon Books in June 1984. The novel offered an origin for &quot;mogwai&quot; and gremlins as a prologue. Supposedly, &quot;mogwai&quot; were created as gentle, contemplative creatures by a scientist on an alien world. However, it was discovered their physiology was unstable. The end result was only 1 in 10,000 &quot;mogwai&quot; would retain their sweet, loving demeanor. The rest would change into creatures the novel referred to as &quot;mischievous&quot;. The minority &quot;mogwai&quot; (the 1 in 10,000) are immortal by human standards, though Gizmo explains to Stripe if he were to undergo the transformation himself, he would become like the others, &quot;short lived and violent&quot;. This origin is unique to the novel but is referred to in the novelization of &quot;Gremlins 2&quot; by David Bischoff. No definitive origin for &quot;mogwai&quot; or gremlins is given in either &quot;Gremlins&quot; film. The novelization contains a subplot that was cut from the original film, where the National Guard plans to neutralize the gremlins with fire hoses.

=== Video games ===

==== Action-oriented video games ====
Several officially licensed video games based on the film have been produced. One of the first was &quot;Gremlins&quot;, released by Atari, Inc. for their 2600 console.

Atari, Inc. released a completely different (and more technically advanced) game—also called &quot;Gremlins&quot;—for the Atari 5200 console and the Apple II, Commodore 64, and IBM PC compatible computers. Although the Atari 5200 version went to manufacturing in 1984, the turmoil surrounding Jack Tramiel&#x27;s takeover of Atari&#x27;s consumer business resulted in it not being released until 1986.

In the 2000s, more games were released; &quot;Gremlins: Unleashed!&quot; was released on Game Boy Color in 2001. The game was about Gizmo trying to catch Stripe and thirty other gremlins, while the gremlins also try to turn Gizmo into a gremlin. Both Gizmo and Stripe are playable characters in the game.

In 2011 NECA, published a Gremlins game for the Wii and Nintendo DS called &quot;Gremlins Gizmo&quot;. This was developed by Pipeworks Software and was released on November 18, 2011.

A Gremlins Team Pack was released for &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; on November 18, 2016. The pack includes minifigures of Gizmo and Stripe, a constructible Polaroid camera and radio-controlled car and grants access to an Adventure World and Battle Arena based on the films. Howie Mandel and Frank Welker reprise their respective roles as Gizmo and Stripe. In the platform fighter &quot;MultiVersus&quot;, Gizmo and Stripe are playable characters, along with a map based on the theater shown in the film.

==== &quot;Gremlins: The Adventure&quot; ====

At the time of the film&#x27;s release, an interactive fiction game based on scenes from the film, entitled &quot;Gremlins: The Adventure&quot; (1985), was released for various home computers, including the Acorn Electron, the BBC Micro, the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum. The game was written by Brian Howarth for Adventure Soft and was text-based, with full-color illustrations on some formats.

=== Miscellaneous ===
In addition to this, &quot;Gremlins&quot; brand breakfast cereal was produced by Ralston concurrent to and for a few years after the first film was released in 1984. The front of the cereal box featured Gizmo, and inside were decals of the malevolent gremlins, including Stripe.

== Sequels and prequel ==

After the commercial success it was followed by a sequel, &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot; in 1990. The film was not as successful as the first, and further films were not planned.

In January 2013, Vulture reported that Warner Bros. was negotiating with Amblin Entertainment to reboot the &quot;Gremlins&quot; franchise. Seth Grahame-Smith was selected to produce, alongside David Katzenberg. In January 2015, Grahame-Smith stated that the project has been put on hold. In November 2015, Zach Galligan confirmed that the third film will be a sequel and not a reboot. In a December 2016 interview with &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot;, Galligan again spoke about a third film saying that &quot;Warner Bros. definitely wants it, Chris Columbus wants to do it because he&#x27;d like to undo the &quot;Gremlins 2&quot; thing as he wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it, and Spielberg wants to.&quot; He claimed &quot;Gremlins 3&quot; is being written by Carl Ellsworth. In an interview with &quot;/Film&quot; in 2017, a script was written by Chris Columbus. His script explored the idea that has been on the fan&#x27;s mind for a long time: &quot;if all the gremlins come from getting Gizmo wet and feeding his mogwai offspring after midnight, should Gizmo be eliminated?&quot; He described his script as &quot;twisted and dark&quot;. In November 2020, Columbus stated that CGI would not be used for the gremlins and that traditional puppets and animatronics would continue to be used.

In 2019, Warner Bros. successfully gained registered trademark of the name and the franchise. That same year, the studio&#x27;s parent company WarnerMedia greenlit an animated prequel series based on the property for its streaming service, Max. The first season, subtitled &quot;Secrets of the Mogwai&quot;, premiered on May 23, 2023. The series was renewed for a second season, subtitled &quot;The Wild Batch&quot;, which was released on October 3, 2024.

In January 2025, it was reported by Deadline that Warner Bros. was developing a third &quot;Gremlins&quot; movie written by Chris Columbus who also was writing a sequel to &quot;The Goonies&quot;. Nothing official has been confirmed by Warner Bros. about a sequel for either film being planned.

== Legacy ==

The film not only spawned the sequel and an advertisement for British Telecom, but is believed to have been the inspiration for several unrelated films about small monsters. These include &quot;Ghoulies&quot;, &quot;Troll&quot;, &quot;Hobgoblins&quot; and &quot;Munchies&quot;.

In music, the Scottish post-rock band Mogwai is named after the film&#x27;s creatures: as for the reason why the band chose this as their name, their guitarist, Stuart Braithwaite, has stated that &quot;it has no significant meaning and we always intended on getting a better one, but like a lot of other things we never got round to it&quot;. Welsh singer and songwriter Rod Thomas performs under the name Bright Light Bright Light, which is a direct quote from the film.

In November 18, 2016, both Gizmo and Stripe made appearances in &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; as playable characters in their own Team Pack. Many of the other in-game playable characters, such as Supergirl, acknowledge the duo&#x27;s rules and they each have their own unique abilities and weaponry; Gizmo having a radio-controlled car inspired by the toy car he piloted in the film&#x27;s climax and Stripe having a camera-like gadget inspired by the ones manufactured by Polaroid Corporation, one of which Kate Beringer armed herself with during the gremlins&#x27; attack on Dorry&#x27;s Tavern. Both Mandel and Welker returned to reprise their respective roles.

In 2017, some gremlins were featured in the animated film &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;, with its director, Chris McKay, explaining his love for the characters. These gremlins were among numerous villains from outside of the &quot;Batman&quot; franchise playing a role in the film, with many of the added antagonists owned by Warner Bros.

In February 2021, a Mountain Dew Zero Sugar ad featuring Zach Galligan as Billy Peltzer and Gizmo was released, which also revealed that Billy has a daughter.

Also in 2021, a trio of Gremlins including Stripe appear in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;. They were shown running towards the site of the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad and can be seen cheering from on top of the blue Bronto-Crane from &quot;The Flintstones&quot;.

Both Gizmo and Stripe appear as playable characters in the 2022 fighting game &quot;MultiVersus&quot;, voiced by Daniel Ross.

Both Gizmo and the sequel&#x27;s Brain Gremlin appear in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode, &quot;Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary&quot; as supporting characters.

<text>The Symphony No. 94 in G major (H. 1/94) is the second of the twelve London symphonies written by Joseph Haydn. It is popularly known as the Surprise Symphony.

==Composition and premiere==
Haydn wrote the symphony in 1791 in London for a concert series he gave during the first of his visits to England (1791–1792). The premiere took place at the Hanover Square Rooms in London on March 23, 1792, with Haydn leading the orchestra seated at a fortepiano.

==Scoring and length==

The Surprise Symphony is scored for a Classical-era orchestra consisting of two each of flutes, oboes, bassoons, horns, trumpets, plus timpani, and the usual string section consisting of violins (first and second), violas, cellos, and double basses. Performances of the Surprise Symphony last about 23 minutes.

==Nickname==

In Haydn&#x27;s old age, his biographer Georg August Griesinger asked him whether he wrote this &quot;surprise&quot; to awaken the audience. Haydn replied:
No, but I was interested in surprising the public with something new, and in making a brilliant debut, so that my student Pleyel, who was at that time engaged by an orchestra in London (in 1792) and whose concerts had opened a week before mine, should not outdo me. The first Allegro of my symphony had already met with countless Bravos, but the enthusiasm reached its highest peak at the Andante with the Drum Stroke. Encore! Encore! sounded in every throat, and Pleyel himself complimented me on my idea.

The work was popular at its premiere. The &quot;Woodfall&#x27;s Register&quot; critic wrote:The third piece of Haydn was a new Overture [i.e. symphony], of very extraordinary merit. It was simple, profound, and sublime. The &quot;andante&quot; movement was particularly admired.The &quot;Morning Herald&quot; critic wrote:
The Room was crowded last night... A new composition from such a man as Haydn is a great event in the history of music. – His novelty of last night was a grand Overture, the subject of which was remarkably simple, but extended to vast complication, exquisitly modulated and striking in effect. Critical applause was fervid and abundant.

The symphony is still popular today, and is frequently performed and recorded.

==Structure==

Like all of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;London&quot; symphonies, the work is in four movements, marked as follows:

The first movement has a lyrical introduction preceding a highly rhythmic main section in time.

The second, &quot;surprise&quot;, movement, is an andante theme and variations in time in the subdominant key of C major. The theme is in two eight-bar sections, each repeated. The repeat at the end of the first section is &quot;pianissimo&quot; with pizzicato in the lower strings to set up the surprise. Four variations of the theme follow, starting with embellishment in sixteenth notes by the first violins, moving to a stormy variation in C minor with trumpets and timpani, followed by solos for the first oboist and flautist, and concluding with a sweeping and lyrical &quot;forte&quot; repeat in triplets. In the coda section, the opening notes are stated once more, this time reharmonized with gently dissonant diminished seventh chords over a tonic pedal.
Haydn&#x27;s music contains many jokes, and the Surprise Symphony includes probably the most famous of all: a sudden fortissimo chord at the end of the otherwise piano opening theme in the variation-form second movement. The music then returns to its original quiet dynamic as if nothing has happened, and the ensuing variations do not repeat the joke. In German, the work is referred to as the Symphony &quot;mit dem Paukenschlag&quot;, or, with the kettledrum stroke.

The third movement is a minuet and trio, in ternary form in the tonic key (G major). The tempo, allegro molto (very quickly), is of note since it marks the historical shift away from the old minuet (which was played at a slower, danceable, tempo) toward the scherzo; by his last quartets Haydn had started marking his minuets &quot;presto&quot;.

The fourth movement is a characteristically rhythmic, energetic and propulsive Haydn finale. The movement is written in sonata rondo form with the opening bars appearing both at the beginning and in the middle of the development section. The stirring coda emphasizes the timpani.

==Later uses==

Toward the end of his active career Haydn wove the theme of the second movement into an aria of his oratorio &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1801), in which the bass soloist depicts a plowman whistling Haydn&#x27;s tune as he works.

The same theme is also frequently adapted for the purpose of teaching musical beginners; see Papa Haydn.

The composer Charles Ives wrote a parody of the second movement in 1909, penning the words &quot;Nice little easy sugar-plum sounds&quot; under the opening notes. Ives was unhappy with concert audiences who unadventurously resisted difficult modern music—as is shown by other words in his parody: &quot;Nice sweety silk bonnet melodies ... nice pretty perfumed sounds for the dress circle cushion chai[r] ears.&quot; Since the opening notes of Haydn&#x27;s second movement are very simple, they were a suitable choice for Ives&#x27;s purpose.

Donald Swann created a version of the Surprise Symphony &#x27;with extra surprises&#x27; for the humorous Hoffnung Music Festival.

<doc id="382395" wikidata="Q12600757" url="?curid=382395" title="Lifestyle disease">
<text>Lifestyle diseases can be defined as the diseases linked to the manner in which a person lives their life. These diseases are non-communicable, and can be caused by lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating, alcohol, substance use disorders and smoking tobacco, which can lead to heart disease, stroke, obesity, type II diabetes and lung cancer. The diseases that appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer include Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, arthritis, atherosclerosis, asthma, cancer, chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney failure, osteoporosis, PCOD, stroke, depression, obesity and vascular dementia.

Concerns were raised in 2011 that lifestyle diseases could soon have an impact on the workforce and the cost of health care. Treating these non-communicable diseases can be expensive. It can be critical for the patient&#x27;s health to receive primary prevention and identify early symptoms of these non-communicable diseases. These lifestyle diseases are expected to increase throughout the years if people do not improve their lifestyle choices.

Some commenters maintain a distinction between diseases of longevity and diseases of civilization or diseases of affluence. Certain diseases, such as diabetes, dental caries and asthma, appear at greater rates in young populations living in the &quot;western&quot; way; their increased incidence is not related to age, so the terms cannot accurately be used interchangeably for all diseases.

== Tamer ==
Diet and lifestyle are major factors thought to influence susceptibility to many diseases. Substance use disorders, such as tobacco smoking, and excessive consumption of alcohol, and a lack of or too much exercise may also increase the risk of developing certain diseases, especially later in life.

In many Western countries, people began to consume more meat, dairy products, vegetable oils, tobacco, sugary foods, sugary beverages, and alcoholic beverages during the latter half of the 20th century. People also developed sedentary lifestyles and greater rates of obesity. Rates of colorectal, breast, prostate, endometrial and lung cancer started increasing after this dietary change. People in developing countries, whose diets still depend largely on low-sugar starchy foods with little meat or fat have lower rates of these cancers. Causes are not just from smoking tobacco and alcohol use. Adults can develop lifestyle diseases through behavioral factors that impact them. Behavioral factors including unemployment, unsafe life, poor social environment, working conditions, stress and home life can increase their risk of developing one of these non-communicable diseases.

== Death statistics in Australia ==
Between 1995 and 2005, 813,000 Australians were hospitalized due to alcohol. In 2014, 11.2 million Australians were overweight or obese.

In 2013, there were 147,678 deaths within Australia mostly from lifestyle diseases. Smoking tobacco, alcohol use and other substances, violence, and unhealthy weight have impacted the Australians&#x27; death rate. The leading cause of death of Australian males was heart disease with 11,016 deaths, followed by lung cancer with 4,995 deaths, and chronic pulmonary disease killing 3,572. All these conditions were mainly attributed to smoking, excessive alcohol use or an unhealthy lifestyle. In 2013, coronary heart disease was the leading cause of death in 8,750 women, mainly as a result of their lifestyle. Dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease came second, affecting 7,277 females and thirdly, cerebrovascular disease, killing 6,368. These top three causes of deaths could be minimized through lifestyle changes within the Australian population.

The table shows the ages of people dying and the top five diseases for which they are dying.
==Death statistics in the United States==

In 1900, the top three causes of death in the United States were pneumonia/influenza, tuberculosis, and diarrhea/enteritis. Communicable diseases accounted for about 60 percent of all deaths. In 1900, heart disease and cancer were ranked number four and eight, respectively. Since the 1940s, the majority of deaths in the United States have resulted from heart disease, cancer, and other degenerative diseases. By the late 1990s, degenerative diseases accounted for more than 60 percent of all deaths.

Lifestyle diseases have their onset later in an individual&#x27;s life; they appear to increase in frequency as countries become more industrialized and people live longer. This suggests that the life expectancy at birth of 49.24 years in 1900
was too short for degenerative diseases to occur, compared to a life expectancy at birth of 77.8 years in 2004. Also, survivorship to the age of 50 was 58.5% in 1900, and 93.7% in 2007.

== Death statistics in India ==
According to a report published by the Indian Council of Medical Research in 2017, 3 of the 5 leading individual causes of disease burden in India were non-communicable, with ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the top two causes and stroke as the fifth leading cause. The range of disease burden or DALY rate among the states in 2016 was 9-fold for ischemic heart disease, 4-fold for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 6-fold for stroke, and 4-fold for diabetes across India. Of the total deaths from major disease groups, 62% of all deaths were caused by non-communicable diseases.
== Prevention ==
Prevention of these non-communicable diseases involves remedies or activities that aim to reduce the likelihood of a disease or disorder affecting people. Lifestyle diseases are preventable for children if parents set them on the correct path, as early life decisions and influences can impact people later on in life. Lifestyle diseases can be prevented through reduction in smoking of tobacco. The Australian Government started by introducing plain packaging for all tobacco products and increasing the prices of tobacco production. Obesity can be prevented through a well-balanced lifestyle through healthy eating and exercise. 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily or 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise a week can be the start of a new lifestyle change. Examples of moderate exercise include a brisk walk, swim, bicycle ride or it can also be everyday life activities like mowing the lawn or house cleaning. In addition, studies have suggested that early life exercise can reduce the risk of developing metabolic diseases in adulthood. All causes of lifestyle disease can be prevented through giving up smoking and other substances, reducing one&#x27;s intake of alcohol, processed meats (like bacon and sausages), red meats (like pork, beef and lamb), fatty foods and by engaging in daily exercise. However, new studies also show preventive effects on recurrent respiratory tract infections in children through the intake of unprocessed food. Beef, green vegetables, and whole dairy can be beneficial because they are unprocessed compared to processed foods. Beef, unlike other types of red meat, can contribute to the health-promoting effects. Eating an excess amount of these foods can have an impact on one&#x27;s health. Certain foods and activities such as smoking and drinking should be done in moderation.

<text>Thaddeus Maxim Eugene (Ted) Dikty (June 16, 1920 – October 11, 1991) was an American editor who also played a role as one of the earliest science fiction anthologists, and as a publisher.

== Early career ==
In 1947, Dikty joined Shasta Publishers as managing editor. With E. F. Bleiler he started the first &quot;Best of the Year&quot; science fiction anthologies, called &quot;The Best Science Fiction&quot;, which ran from 1949 until 1957.

In 1953, he married writer Julian May, whom he had met at a science fiction convention in Ohio. Both of them worked for Chicago-area publishers; in 1957 the two started Publication Associates, an editorial service which created books (from writing to completion of bound copies) for specialty children&#x27;s publishers who sold primarily to the school and library markets: May did the writing, and Dikty served as designer and producer. In the early 1970s Dikty and partners started a small press, FAX Collector&#x27;s Editions, which reprinted selected pulp-era (and earlier) SF stories and novels, and had some commercial success with reprints of work by Robert E. Howard (creator of Conan the Barbarian).

== Starmont House and death ==
In 1976, after the family had moved to West Linn, Oregon, Dikty founded the specialty publisher Starmont House, which published non-fiction about the science fiction field. At the time of his death in 1991 at the age of 71, Dikty and May had moved to Mercer Island, Washington; his daughter, Barbara Dikty, had already been made president of Starmont House, Inc. by then.

In September 2013, he was posthumously named to the First Fandom Hall of Fame in a ceremony at the 71st World Science Fiction Convention.

<text> (We thank you, God, we thank you), 29, is a sacred cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He composed it in Leipzig in 1731 for , the annual inauguration of a new town council, and first performed it on 27 August of that year. The cantata was part of a festive service in the . The cantata text by an unknown author includes in movement 2 the beginning of Psalm 75, and as the closing chorale the fifth stanza of Johann Gramann&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Bach scored the work in eight movements for four vocal parts and a festive Baroque orchestra of three trumpets, timpani, two oboes, strings, an obbligato organ and basso continuo. The organ dominates the first movement &quot;Sinfonia&quot; which Bach derived from a &quot;Partita&quot; for violin. The full orchestra accompanies the first choral movement and plays with the voices in the closing chorale, while a sequence of three arias alternating with two recitatives is scored intimately.

Bach used the music from the choral movement for both the and of his Mass in B minor.

== History and words ==
Bach composed the cantata in 1731 for , the inauguration of the new town council, which was celebrated annually in a festive service in the on the Monday following the feast day of St. Bartholomew . It was not a democratic election, but a &quot;ceremonial transfer of office&quot; of council members who were appointed. The service was not part of the liturgical year with cantata texts related to prescribed biblical epistle and gospel readings. For the same occasion, Bach had already written the cantata , in his first year in Leipzig, 1723. For the Ratswechsel service, he could count on the entire council (his employer) listening, probably also civil servants and representatives of the Elector&#x27;s administration for the region. The musicologist Klaus Hofmann notes: &quot;It was an opportunity for Bach to show how sacred music was flourishing under his direction and to present himself as a composer.&quot;

The cantata text of &quot;Wir danken dir, Gott&quot; by an unknown author includes in movement 2 the first verse of Psalm 75 () and as the closing chorale the fifth stanza of Johann Gramann&#x27;s hymn of praise &quot;&quot; (1540).

Bach first performed the cantata on 27 August 1731. In 1733, he adapted the music of the first choral movement with only minor changes for the of his Kyrie-Gloria Mass for the Dresden court, on a text expressing the same idea in Latin. According to Hofmann, the movement is based on an earlier lost composition.

Bach performed the cantata for Ratswechsel at least two more times, on 31 August 1739 and on 25 August 1749. He expanded the Missa of 1733 to his Mass in B minor and concluded his work by repeating the music as the .

== Scoring and structure ==
The cantata is structured in eight movements and takes about 28 minutes to perform. The instrumentation reflects the festive occasion for which it was written. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass) (B), a four-part choir, and a Baroque orchestra of three trumpets (Tr), timpani (Ti), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl) (violin solo in movement 3), violas (Va), an obbligato organ (Org) and basso continuo (Bc). The autograph score is titled: &quot;Bey der Rahts-Wahl / 1731. / Wir dancken dir, Gott, wir dancken dir. / à / 4 Voci. / 3 Trombe / Tamburi / 2 Hautbois / 2 Violini / Viola / e / Continuo / con Organo obligato / di / Joh.Seb:Bach.

In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe, and the abbreviations for voices and instruments the list of Bach cantatas. The time signature is provided using the symbol for common time (4/4). The timpani are listed with the trumpets because they always play together.

== Music ==
=== 1 ===

The cantata is one of few sacred Bach cantatas opened by an orchestral sinfonia. Another is the early . The music is an arrangement of the prelude from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Partita&quot; for violin, BWV 1006, which Bach had already revised for organ and strings in 1729 for the wedding cantata . In the cantata for Ratswechsel, the solo organ plays the original violin part &quot;in virtuoso motoric writing&quot;, while the full orchestra adds an accompaniment.

=== 2 ===
The first vocal movement is a setting of verse 1 of Psalm 75, &quot;&quot;, translated in the King James version of the bible as &quot;Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare&quot;. In contrast to the virtuoso introduction, the chorus begins in motet style in grave stile antico. The bass begins in great simplicity a theme in even steps; the tenor starts imitating almost immediately, the alto a little later, then the soprano. A countersubject illustrates the telling of God&#x27;s wonders, embellishing the words (&quot;declare&quot;) and (&quot;wondrous works&quot;). In the beginning only oboes and strings play with the voices, then a trumpet doubles the soprano. Developing further, two trumpets take part in the polyphony, and a climax is reached when the third trumpet and timpani enter. Hofmann comments that although the movement begins in old style, &quot;Bach’s method of intensification (by means of which he gradually introduces trumpets and ultimately allows the theme to be heard in stretta) is thoroughly baroque.

=== 3 ===
&quot; (Alleluia, strength and power) is set as an aria for tenor. The voice, a solo violin and the continuo are equal partners.

=== 4 ===
A recitative for bass, &quot; (Praise God! It is well for us!) mentions that God &quot;holds his hand protectively and in blessing above the city&quot;.

=== 5 ===
The soprano aria is a prayer, &quot;&quot; (Consider us with Your love)‘’ (‘Think of us with your love’) for &quot;God’s future providence&quot;, described by Hofmann as &quot;a musical display piece full of warmth and tenderness in a rocking siciliano rhythm. For long stretches in the vocal sections, Bach does without a continuo accompaniment (thus without the instrumental bass register) – a tactic that effectively contributes to creating a sonic impression of tenderness and charm&quot;.

=== 6 ===
A recitative for alto is a prayer for future protection, &quot;&quot; (Do not forget later, with Your hand), concluded by a choral &quot;Amen&quot; in unison. The surprise is an interpretation of a line quoted from , &quot;und alles Volk soll sagen: Amen!&quot; (And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.).

=== 7 ===
The alto performs the last aria, &quot; (Hallelujah, power and might)‘’, repeating and reinforcing the thoughts of the first. The music repeats the main section of the tenor aria, now accompanied by the organ. This close connection within the structure of the work of both the theme (3 and 7) and the instrument (1 and 7) is unusual in Bach&#x27;s cantatas.

=== 8 ===
In the closing chorale, &quot; (Glory, and praise with honor) the trumpets accentuate the ends of some lines of the fifth verse of Johann Gramann&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Sysmex XE-2100 is a haematology automated analyser, used to quickly perform full blood counts and reticulocyte counts. It is made by the Sysmex Corporation.

It can be run on its own, or connected to a blood film making and staining unit. Racks of blood go in on a tray on the right, and come out the left side. The racks hold ten 4.5 mL tubes, and have a notch so they can only go in one way.

As the tubes go through the machine, two are picked up and inverted five times to mix, the first one is sampled. They are put down again, the rack moves along one space and two more are picked up and mixed five times, this assures that each tube is inverted ten times before being sampled.

The caps are left on the tubes as they go through the machine. A piercer takes a sample through the rubber centre while the tube is upside down. EDTA (lavender) tubes are usually used, although citrate (blue top) tubes will also work (although the result must be corrected because of dilution).

Paediatric and oversized tubes can be put through manually via a sampler on the left-hand side of the machine.

Data from the XE-2100 can be viewed with a computer program.

==Price==
This machine can be purchased for around US$107,000

==Principles of measurement==
Blood is sampled and diluted, and moves through a tube thin enough that cells pass by one at a time. Characteristics about the cell are measured using lasers (fluorescence flow cytometry) or electrical impedance.

Because not everything about the cells can be measured at the same time, blood is separated into a number of different channels. In the XE-2100 there are five different channels: WBC/BASO, DIFF, IMI, RET and NRBC.

<text>Fletcher Knebel (October 1, 1911 – February 26, 1993) was an American author of several popular works of political fiction.

Knebel was born in Dayton, Ohio, but relocated a number of times during his youth. He graduated from high school in Yonkers, New York, spent a year studying at the University of Paris and graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio during 1934. Upon graduation, he received a job offer from the newspaper &quot;Coatesville Record&quot; of Coatesville, Pennsylvania. He spent the next 20 years working for newspapers, eventually becoming the political columnist for Cowles Publications. Knebel served in the United States Navy during World War II, attaining the rank of lieutenant. From 1951 to 1964, he satirized national politics and government in a nationally published column named &quot;Potomac Fever&quot;.

During 1960, he wrote a chapter on John F. Kennedy for the book &quot;Candidates 1960&quot;. This seemed to begin a passion for writing books, and he went on to write fifteen, most of them fiction, and all of them dealing with politics, intrigue and social upheaval. His best-known novel is &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1962, co-authored with Charles W. Bailey), about an attempted military coup in the United States. The book was a great success, reaching number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list, and was made into a successful movie also named &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; during 1964.
Knebel was married four times from 1935 to 1985. He committed suicide after a long bout with cancer, by taking an overdose of sleeping pills in his home in Honolulu, Hawaii, during 1993. He is the source of the quote: &quot;Smoking is one of the leading causes of statistics.&quot;

== Bibliography ==
*&quot;Seven Days in May&quot; (1962) (described above).
*&quot;Convention&quot; (1964), also written with Charles Bailey, about a woman from the Midwest United States who serves as a delegate at a major political convention.
*&quot;Night of Camp David&quot; (1965), about a President of the United States who may be insane.
*&quot;The ZinZin Road&quot; (1966), about Peace Corps workers in Africa caught in an incipient revolution.
*&quot;Vanished&quot; (1968), about the political effects of the sudden, mysterious disappearance of the main aide to the President of the United States during a contentious re-election campaign.
*&quot;Trespass&quot; (1969), about black militants occupying homes owned by rich Caucasians and demanding that title be given to the militants as the beginning of the creation of a black nation in the American South.
*&quot;Dark Horse&quot; (1972), about a minor official chosen to replace a Presidential candidate who died shortly before the election.
*&quot;Poker Game&quot; (1973), a story set in the world of computers.
*&quot;The Bottom Line&quot; (1974), a novel about a business company convention and a man who found there&#x27;s also a bottom line in private lives.
*&quot;Dave Sulkin Cares!&quot; (1978), a story of love between two con artists, Gail and Johnny.
*&quot;Crossing in Berlin&quot; (1981), about an American man assisting an East German woman escape from East Germany.
*&quot;Sabotage&quot; (1986), about sabotage of oil tankers by Japanese organized crime mobsters.
Generally, Knebel&#x27;s works are products of the times during which they were produced. For instance, the delegate in &quot;Convention&quot; changes her vote after learning that the candidate she had originally favored is using a computer to track personal information about the delegates. &quot;Vanished&quot; involved concerns about superpower nuclear proliferation during the Cold War. &quot;Trespass&quot; concerns black militancy of the type that largely ended during the late 1970s. Knebel was also a staunch liberal who was &quot;suspicious of the size and power of the American military&quot; and intelligence community, as he wrote in &quot;Dark Horse;&quot; many of his novels represented that opinion.

<text>Super giant slalom, or super-G, is a racing discipline of alpine skiing. Along with the faster downhill, it is regarded as a &quot;speed&quot; event, in contrast to the technical events giant slalom and slalom. It debuted as an official World Cup event during the 1983 season and was added to the official schedule of the World Championships in 1987 and the Winter Olympics in 1988.

Much like downhill, a super-G course consists of widely set gates that racers must pass through. The course is set so that skiers must turn more than in downhill, though the speeds are still much higher than in giant slalom (hence the name). Each athlete only has one run to clock the best time. In the Olympics, super-G courses are usually set on the same slopes as the downhill, but with a lower starting point.

==History==
Super-G was run as a World Cup test event during the 1982 season, with two men&#x27;s races and a women&#x27;s race that did not count in the season standings. 

Approved by the International Ski Federation (FIS) that summer, it was first officially run at the World Cup level in December 1982 at Val-d&#x27;Isère, France; the winner was Peter Müller of Switzerland. The first official women&#x27;s super-G was run a month later in early January 1983, with consecutive events at Verbier, Switzerland. The first winner was Irene Epple of West Germany, and Cindy Nelson of the United States won the next day on a different course. 

These were the only two races for women in super-G during the 1983 season; the men had three. The event was not universally embraced during its early years, which included a boycott by two-time defending overall champion Phil Mahre in December 1982.

For the first three seasons, super-G results were added into the giant slalom discipline for the season standings; it gained separate status for a crystal globe for the 1986 season with five events for both men and women; the first champions were Markus Wasmeier and Marina Kiehl, both of West Germany.

It was added to the World Championships in 1987, held at Crans-Montana, Switzerland. Swiss skiers Pirmin Zurbriggen and Maria Walliser won gold medals to become the first world champions in the event. Super-G made its Olympic debut in 1988 in Calgary, where Franck Piccard of France and Sigrid Wolf of Austria took gold at Nakiska.

==Top racers==

===Men===

Hermann Maier of Austria (nicknamed &#x27;The Herminator&#x27;) is widely regarded as the greatest male super-G racer, with 24 World Cup victories and five World Cup titles (1998–2001, 2004). He won the world championship in 1999 and an Olympic gold medal in 1998, three days after a crash in the downhill. 

Maier&#x27;s proficiency in super-G was attributed to his thorough course inspection and his aggressive course tactics; he opted for the most direct and dangerous line down the hill. A serious motorcycle accident in August 2001 nearly resulted in an amputation of his lower right leg and sidelined him for the 2002 season, including the 2002 Olympics. After his return to the World Cup circuit in January 2003, Maier won eight more World Cup super-G events and his fifth season title in 2004.

Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway is second on the list with 17 wins in World Cup super-G races, Kjetil Jansrud third with his 13 wins. Svindal won Olympic gold in 2010 and his fifth season title in 2014

Pirmin Zurbriggen won four consecutive season titles (1987–90) and was the first world champion of this discipline in 1987. 

Kjetil André Aamodt of Norway, a triple gold medalist in Olympic super-G races, winning in 1992, 2002 and 2006. Aamodt won five World Cup races and two world championship medals (silver and bronze) in the discipline.

Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg, a five-time overall World Cup champion, won nine World Cup super-G events. He won season titles in every discipline except super-G, where he was a runner-up three times. Girardelli was the silver medalist in the super-G at the 1987 World Championships and the 1992 Olympics.

===Women===

Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. leads with 28 World Cup victories in super-G and has won five season titles (2009–2012, 2015). 

Lara Gut-Behrami of Switzerland has won 22 World Cup races, five season titles (2014, 2016, 2021, 2023, 2024 ), and a Gold medal in the event at the 2022 Winter Olympics. 

Katja Seizinger of Germany won five season titles in the 1990s, with 16 World Cup wins in the discipline.

Neither Vonn and Seizinger have won gold in the super-G at the Olympics (both won a bronze) while Gut-Behrami has. However all three of them have won a world title, Vonn in 2009, Gut-Behrami in 2021 and Seizinger in 1993.

Renate Götschl of Austria won 17 World Cup events in super-G, three season titles, and two medals (silver and bronze) in the world 
championships.

==Course==
The vertical drop for a Super-G course must be between for men, for women, and for children. 

In the Olympic Winter Games, FIS World Ski Championships, and FIS World Cups, minimums are raised to for both men and women. Courses are normally at least in width, but sections with lower widths are permissible if the line and terrain before and after allow it. Higher widths can also be required if deemed necessary. Gates must be between and in width for open gates, and between and in width for vertical gates. The distance between turning poles of successive gates must be at least . The number of direction changes must be at least 7% of the course drop in meters (6% for Olympic Winter Games, FIS World Ski Championships and FIS World Cups).

==Equipment==
In an attempt to increase safety, the 2004 season saw the FIS impose minimum ski lengths for the super-G for the first time: to for men and for women. The minimum turning radius was increased to for the 2014 season.

<text>Heroic medicine, also referred to as heroic depletion theory, was a therapeutic method advocating for rigorous treatment of bloodletting, purging, and sweating to shock the body back to health after an illness caused by a humoral imbalance. Rising to the front of orthodox medical practice in the &quot;Age of Heroic Medicine&quot; (1780–1850), it fell out of favor in the mid-19th century as gentler treatments were shown to be more effective and the idea of palliative treatment began to develop.

Pockets of medical methodology that can be classified as &quot;heroic&quot; appear in the early 17th century with Parisian physician Guy Patin and French anatomist Jean Riolan the Younger. Patin, nicknamed &quot;Le Grand Saigneur&quot; (the Grand Bloodletter), was infamous for his rigorous procedure plans, which included intensive courses of bloodletting and application of senna. Because heroic medicine used popular techniques, it is difficult to absolutely classify a healer&#x27;s therapeutic epistemology as heroic. Intensive bloodletting treatments can be identified throughout American history, with William Douglass in Massachusetts advocating for a heroic treatment plan in the early 18th century. While there were practitioners here and there who were particularly eager to perform aggressive treatment, heroic medicine did not become a concentrated school of thought until later in the 18th century.

Many associate Benjamin Rush with an abrupt acceptance of heroic techniques into the realm of mainstream medicine, especially in America. Founding father, creator of University of Pennsylvania’s medical school, and known as the &quot;American Hippocrates,&quot; Rush was well respected and revered in the medical field. The Philadelphia Yellow Fever outbreak in 1793 is looked upon as a major event in the merging of heroic medicine into the course of best practices in the medical profession. Much of the city was left incapacitated by the rampant epidemic. As healers fled the city, Rush bravely remained to treat people, and ultimately himself, with drastic regimens of intensive bloodlettings and purgatives. He taught many students who then carried the tradition to other parts of the United States. Varied in its influence, heroic medicine was particularly concentrated around Pennsylvania and spread into other locations. The term &quot;heroic medicine&quot; was coined later in the mid-19th century to describe extreme treatment.

Heroic medicine was used to treat George Washington on his deathbed in 1799. He was bled repeatedly and given Mercury(I) chloride (calomel) and several blisters of cantharidin to induce sweating. Washington died shortly afterwards.

Heroic medicine was very much in the hands of the professional, as the invasive interventions involved were beyond the capabilities of rustic practitioners. Symptoms were not regarded as the body&#x27;s attempt to fight the disease, but were considered a complication that would exacerbate the patient&#x27;s condition and do further harm. Practitioners believed that a fever should be suppressed and any drugs used should be powerful and given in large dosages. Under this onslaught, domestic medicine dwindled in importance; even treatments that had been found effective in the past were relegated to the realms of old-fashioned folk medicine.

== Practices ==
Heroic medicine does not have a definitive start date, as its treatments themselves were not new to the field of medicine. Bloodletting, purging, and sweating are cemented firmly in medical tradition back to the advent of humoral theory in the time of Hippocrates and Galen. With hopes of rebalancing the body&#x27;s delicate homeostasis of four humors – black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood – the careful manipulation of bodily discharge, like bleeding and evacuation, was believed to nudge the body back to its healthy, natural state. The physician&#x27;s role was always to monitor the path of the body&#x27;s humoral levels back to normal.

Heroic medicine takes this methodology to the extreme, draining significant volumes of blood and ordering intensive regimens of evacuation. It was not uncommon for physicians to strive to drain up to 80 percent of a patient&#x27;s blood volume. Likewise, dramatic evacuations, both by pharmacological emetics and laxatives, induced the forceful removal of bodily fluid. Commonly used emetics include senna and tartar emetic. General intestinal cleansing was instigated by massive doses of calomel, to the point of acute mercury poisoning. Sweating was also induced using blisters of cantharidin and diaphoretic.

== Fall of heroic medicine ==
Heroic medicine became less favoured with the advent of medical science. Even during its heyday, heroic medicine faced criticism from physicians and alternative medicine healers like the Homeopaths, who pushed for more natural cures. In the modern day, there are few proponents of heroic medicine.

<text>Freighthopping or trainhopping is the act of surreptitiously boarding and riding a freightcar, which is usually illegal.

==History==
Illegally hopping a ride on a private freight car began with the invention of the train. In the United States, freighthopping became a common means of transportation following the American Civil War as the railroads began pushing westward, especially among migrant workers who became known as &quot;hobos&quot;. It continued to be widely used by those unable to afford other transportation, especially during times of widespread economic dislocation such as the Great Depression. The practice was heralded in popular culture of 20th century America with songs such as &quot;King of the Road&quot;, and films like &quot;Emperor of the North Pole&quot;. For a variety of reasons the practice is less common in the 21st century, although a community of freight-train riders still exists. 

Typically, hoppers will go to a rail yard where trains stop to pick up and unload freight and switch out crew. They will either board a freight car in some fashion unseen or “catch one on the fly” once it has begun to move. Train surfing is a similar activity that involves the act of riding on the outside of a moving train, tram or another rail transport.

===Riding the rods===
Most train hoppers simply rode in or above freight cars. Another historic method was “riding the rods“. In the early 1900s days of wood frame freight car construction, steel truss rods were used to support the underside of the car in order to provide it with the strength to carry heavy loads. There could be four or more of these truss rods under the car floor running the length of the car, and hobos would “ride the rods”. Some would carry a board to place across the rods to lie on. Others would lie on just one rod and hold on tightly. Riding the rods was very dangerous. When a train moved at high speed, the cars could bounce and rock violently if the track was rough, and rock ballast might be tossed up which could strike a rider.

==Dangers==

Riding outside a freight car, whether atop or underneath, is dangerous. Being in a loaded car with shifting, heavy cargo can also be dangerous. 

The 1944 Balvano train disaster in Italy involved hundreds of freighthoppers.

==Today==
Hopping trains happens all over the world and varies from place to place. Some places are more critical and consider freight hopping a crime, and other places are more lenient.

;Europe
Despite increased deterrent measures, would-be migrants use the Eurostar and Eurotunnel Shuttle to cross the English Channel from France to England.

;United States
Union Pacific Railroad in the United States encourages people who witness transients on freight trains to report them to its dispatch center. According to a sheriff&#x27;s deputy from Lincoln County, Nebraska train hoppers no longer write symbols on trees and buildings, but there is still a network of train hoppers that occurs mostly online.

;Mexico
It is estimated that yearly between 400,000 and 500,000 migrants—the majority of whom are from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras—hop freight trains in the effort to reach the United States. The freight trains are known as La Bestia.

;Mauritania
In the Mauritania Railway, freighthoppers can ride with their cargo freely due to the lack of road between Zouérat and Nouadhibou.

<doc id="382416" wikidata="Q167307" url="?curid=382416" title="Dom Mintoff">
<text>Dominic Mintoff (, ; often called &quot;il-Perit&quot;, &quot;the Architect&quot;; 6 August 1916 – 20 August 2012) was a Maltese socialist politician, architect, and civil engineer who was leader of the Labour Party from 1949 to 1984, and was 8th Prime Minister of Malta from 1955 to 1958, when Malta was still a British colony, and again, following independence, from 1971 to 1984. His tenure as Prime Minister saw the creation of a comprehensive welfare state, nationalisation of large corporations, a substantial increase in the general standard of living and the establishment of the Maltese republic, but was later on marred by a stagnant economy, a rise in authoritarianism and outbreaks of political violence.

==Early life and education==
Mintoff was born on 6 August 1916, the third-born and eldest male sibling of nine, born to Lawrence (or Laurence) &quot;Wenzu&quot; Mintoff (who hailed from an old Gozitan family) and his wife, Concetta Farrugia (known in Maltese as Ċetta tax-Xiħ). He was baptised the next day in his hometown Bormla in the Sanctuary of the Immaculate Conception. His father was a local cook employed by the British Royal Navy and his mother was reputed to have been a pawn broker or money lender. He attended a seminary but did not join the priesthood. One of his brothers did become a priest, however, and one of his sisters became a nun. Dom enrolled at the University of Malta. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science and, later, as an architect and civil engineer (1937). That same year he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and pursued his studies at Hertford College, Oxford, where he earned a Masters in Science and Engineering in 1939.

==Political career==
=== Early political career (1935–1949) ===
After a brief stint as an official of the Bormla Labour Party club, Mintoff was Labour&#x27;s Secretary General between 1935 and 1945 (resigning briefly to pursue his studies abroad). He was first elected to public office in 1945 to the Government Council. In the same year, Mintoff was elected Deputy Leader of the Party with a wide margin that placed him in an indisputable position as the successor, if not a challenger, to party leader Paul Boffa. After Labour&#x27;s victory at the polls in 1947, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction, overseeing large post-War public projects.

===Leader of the Labour Party (1949–1984)===

; First two mandates 
Mintoff&#x27;s strong position and ambition led to a series of Cabinet crises. A split in the Labour Party came about when Boffa, who was ready for compromise and moderation with the colonial authorities, resigned and formed the Malta Workers Party and Mintoff refounded the Labour Party as the &quot;Malta Labour Party&quot; of which he assumed leadership. The split resulted in the weakening of both parties and it was not until 1955 after remaining out of government for three consecutive legislatures, that the Labour Party was elected to office with Mintoff as Prime Minister. This government&#x27;s main political platform – integration with the UK – led to a deterioration of the Party&#x27;s relations with the Catholic Church, leading to interdiction by the Church which resulted in voting Labour being declared a mortal sin leading all who defied the Church to be informally known as &quot;Suldati tal-Azzar&quot; (&quot;Soldiers of Steel&quot;). The Labour Party lost the subsequent two elections in 1962 and 1966, and boycotted the Independence celebrations in 1964 due to disagreements with the Independence agreements which still gave a good amount of power to the British Government.

Following the lift of the interdiction in 1964, and the improvement of relationship with the Catholic Church in 1969, Dom Mintoff was elected as Prime Minister when Labour won the 1971 general election and immediately set out to re-negotiate the post-Independence military and financial agreements with the United Kingdom. The government also undertook socialist-style nationalisation programmes, import substitution schemes, and the expansion of the public sector, the collective sector and the welfare state. Employment laws were revised with gender equality being introduced in salary pay. In the case of civil law, civil (non-religious) marriage was introduced and sodomy, homosexuality and adultery were legalised. Through a package of constitutional reforms agreed to with the opposition party, Malta declared itself a republic in 1974. In 1979, the last British troops left Malta.

; Social and political troubles in the 1980s 
The Labour Party was confirmed in office in the 1976 elections. In 1981, amid allegations of gerrymandering, the Party managed to hold on to a parliamentary majority, even though the opposition Nationalist Party managed an absolute majority of votes. A serious political crisis ensued when Nationalist MPs refused to accept the electoral result and also refused to take their seats in parliament for the first years of the legislature. Mintoff called this action &quot;perverse&quot; but it was not an uncommon one in any parliamentary democracy with disputed election results. He proposed to his parliamentary group that fresh elections be held, but most members of his Parliamentary group rejected his proposal as it was likely that the prior result would be repeated. Mintoff stayed on as prime minister until 1984, during which time he suspended the work of the Constitutional Court during discussions with the Opposition to amend the Constitution. He resigned as Prime Minister and Party leader aged 68 in 1984 (although he retained his parliamentary seat), opening the way for his deputy prime minister, Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, to succeed him.

For the 1981 elections, the opposition Nationalist Party, reinvigorated with a new leader and backed by various Conservative and Christian Democratic parties in Western Europe, looked set for a serious challenge to Mintoff. In fact, in that election, the Partit Nazzjonalista managed an absolute majority of votes, but managed only 31 seats to the Malta Labour Party&#x27;s 34. Mintoff said that he would not be ready to govern in such conditions and hinted that he would call for fresh elections within six months. However, pressure from party members forced Mintoff to do otherwise: Mintoff eventually accepted the President&#x27;s invitation to form a government. This led to a political crisis whose effects continued through much of the 1980s characterised by mass civil disobedience and protests led by Opposition Leader Eddie Fenech Adami as well as increasing political violence, such as Black Monday.

===Labour backbencher (1984–1998)===
Mintoff resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labour Party in 1984, while retaining his Parliamentary seat and remaining a government backbencher. He was succeeded by Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici. Mintoff was instrumental in convincing his parliamentary colleagues to support constitutional amendments ensuring a parliamentary majority for the party achieving an absolute majority of votes. A repeat of 1981 was thus avoided, and the Partit Nazzjonalista went on to win the 1987 elections. The Labour Party went into opposition for the first time in sixteen years. He successfully contested the 1992 and 1996 elections. However, there was a growing rift between Mintoff, seen as Old Labour, and Alfred Sant, the new Labour Leader. Things came to a head in 1998 when the Labour government was negotiating the lease of sealine to be developed in a yacht marina in Birgu. Mintoff eventually voted against the government&#x27;s motion which was defeated. The Prime Minister saw this as a loss of confidence and The President, acting on Prime Minister Sant&#x27;s advice dissolved Parliament and elections were held. This was the first time, since the war, that Mintoff&#x27;s name was not on the ballot paper and the Malta Labour Party lost heavily.

=== Foreign policy ===

After Mintoff&#x27;s initial attempts at integration with Great Britain proved unsuccessful he resigned in 1958 and became a strident advocate of decolonisation and independence. Returning to office in 1971, he immediately set about renegotiating Malta&#x27;s defence agreement with Britain. The difficult negotiations with Britain, which later resulted in the departure of British forces in 1979 and the attendant losses in rent, were coupled with a policy of Cold War brinkmanship which saw Mintoff seek to play rivals off each other and look increasingly east and south, courting Mao Zedong, Kim Il Sung, Nicolae Ceaușescu and Muammar Gaddafi.

Recently declassified CIA reports show the United States&#x27; fears that a Mintoff-led government in Malta could see the country fall under the Soviet sphere of influence. Mintoff opposed Malta&#x27;s EU and Eurozone membership on the concern for Malta&#x27;s status as a constitutionally neutral country.

==Post-retirement (1998–2012)==
After his retirement from parliamentary politics, Mintoff&#x27;s involvement in public life was only occasional. He made some appearances in the referendum campaign on Malta&#x27;s membership to the EU and, with Alfred Sant being replaced in 2008, some rapprochement with Labour was made.

==Personal life==
On 22 November 1947, Mintoff married Moyra de Vere Bentinck (11 July 1918 – 16 December 1997), daughter of Lt. Col. Reginald Bentinck, of Dutch and British noble lineage related via the Cavendish-Bentinck line to Queen Elizabeth II. The couple wed at the parish church of Bir id-Deheb (&quot;Our Lady of Mercy&quot;), a tiny 19th century chapel on the outskirts of Żejtun. The chapel&#x27;s rector was Canon Ġwann Vella, a friend of Mintoff. They met during his studies in Oxford. The couple had two daughters, including Yana.

==Death==
Mintoff was taken to hospital on 18 July 2012. He was later discharged on 4 August and spent his 96th birthday at home where he died on 20 August. He was given a state funeral by the Government of Malta on 25 August.

==Legacy==
While generations of loyal supporters continue to credit Mintoff with the introduction of social benefits like the children&#x27;s allowance, two-thirds pensions, minimum wage and social housing as well as the creation of Air Malta, Sea Malta, the separation of church and state and ending 200 years of British colonial rule, critics point to his divisive legacy, and the violence and unrest that characterised his time in office. It has also been pointed out by Mintoff&#x27;s critics that a pervasive cult of personality has been maintained after his death, most prominently within the Labour Party.

Mintoff&#x27;s legacy in Malta is extremely apparent, being the longest-ruling Prime Minister in Maltese history, and overseeing the transition of Malta away from a British colony, to a socialist-aligned, neutral republic. As such, the modern legal and societal structure of Malta were developed under the Labour government.

Mintoff was fundamental to the development of the Maltese constitution and the development of Maltese foreign policy, in which Malta was a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, and prioritised good relations with the second and Third World. The modern system of nationalised health care in Malta was likewise created under Mintoff, as well as the modern Maltese housing system. Mintoff is controversially also remembered as an authoritarian socialist that dominated the structure of the Maltese government.

The economy of Malta, a relatively high income nation with a highly advanced welfare economy, and subsidies were devolved under Mintoff. Under Mintoff, Language reforms saw an increase of schools teaching Maltese, which managed to revive the language from previous colonial-era decline.

In 2013, the main square in front the church of Our Lady of Mercy in Bir id-Deheb, Żejtun (where Dom and Moyra Mintoff were married) was renamed Dom Mintoff Square.

A statue of Mintoff was unveiled in his hometown Cospicua on 12 December 2014, designed by the artist Noel Galea Bason. 

In March 2016, Corradino Road () in Paola was renamed Dom Mintoff Road (). Other roads were subsequently renamed in his honour in Bormla and Marsa. Another street named after Mintoff is located in the capital of Gozo, Rabat. In August 2016, a monument to Mintoff was unveiled in the Chinese Garden of Serenity in Santa Luċija. Many plaques and monuments commemorating various anniversaries of his leadership of the Labour Party can be found around Malta, primarily near current or former Labour Party clubs.

In May 2018, a second statue of Mintoff was unveiled in Castille Square in Valletta directly opposite the office of the Prime Minister.

In May 2019, a garden in Paola was renamed Dom Mintoff Garden after extensive rehabilitation works. In August 2019, a hall was renamed after Mintoff in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in recognition of his contributions towards Maltese foreign policy.

In June 2023, a third statue of Mintoff was unveiled by the Paola Local Council in Dom Mintoff Garden designed by renowned sculptor Alfred Camilleri Cauchi.

==Awards and honours==
===National honours===
* Companion of Honour of the National Order of Merit (1990) &quot;by right as a former Prime Minister of Malta&quot;
* Malta Self-Government Re-introduction Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Medal (1996)
* Malta Independence Fiftieth Anniversary Medal (2014) &quot;posthumous&quot;

===Foreign honours===
* Order of the Republic of Libya (1971)
* Grand Cordon of the Order of the Republic of Tunisia (1973)
* Grand Cordon of the Order of Ouissam Alaouite (1978)
* Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights (2008)

==Biography==
In May 2021 the first fully-researched biography of Mintoff was launched in Malta. &quot;The Tail That Wagged The Dog: The life and struggles of Dom Mintoff (1916-2012)&quot;, written and published in English by Mark Montebello, was issued by SKS Publications, a branch of Malta’s Labour Party, which commissioned the book. Though at first welcomed by Prime Minister Robert Abela, the leader of the party, he later repudiated the biography, though the book was not withheld from being sold by the publisher. The vacillation was mainly due to Mintoff’s children disassociating themselves from the publication. The author firmly stood by his work. Seven years in the making, the 640-page book was nonetheless positively hailed by critics, and even shortlisted for the national book prize.

<text>South Eastern Trains (stylised as Southeastern) was a publicly owned train operating company that operated the South Eastern Passenger Rail Franchise between November 2003, when it took over from Connex South Eastern, and 1 April 2006, when Southeastern began operating the new Integrated Kent franchise.

South Eastern Trains began operating the South Eastern franchise from November 2003, taking over after the franchise was removed from Connex South Eastern. On 18 January 2005 the Strategic Rail Authority issued the Integrated Kent franchise Invitation to Tender to the shortlisted bidders.

On 30 November 2005 the Department for Transport awarded Govia the Integrated Kent franchise. The services operated by South Eastern Trains transferred to Southeastern on 1 April 2006.

<doc id="382421" wikidata="Q1426219" url="?curid=382421" title="Sopwith Aviation Company">
<text>The Sopwith Aviation Company was a British aircraft company that designed and manufactured aeroplanes mainly for the British Royal Naval Air Service, the Royal Flying Corps and later the Royal Air Force during the First World War, most famously the Sopwith Camel. Sopwith aircraft were also used in varying numbers by the French, Belgian and American air services during the war.

In April 1919, the company was renamed as the Sopwith Aviation &amp; Engineering Company Limited. In September 1920, the company entered voluntary liquidation after an attempt to build motorcycles failed. The patents and other assets were bought by a new company, H.G. Hawker Engineering.

==Early years==

The Sopwith Aviation Company (based at Brooklands) was created in June 1912 by Thomas Sopwith, a wealthy sportsman interested in aviation, yachting and motor-racing, when he was 24 years old. Following their first military aircraft sale in November 1912, Sopwith moved to the company&#x27;s first factory premises which opened that December in a recently closed roller skating rink in Canbury Park Road near Kingston Railway Station in South West London. An early collaboration with the S. E. Saunders boatyard of East Cowes on the Isle of Wight, in 1913, produced the Sopwith &quot;Bat Boat&quot;, an early flying boat with a Consuta laminated hull which could operate on sea or land. A small factory subsequently opened in Woolston, Hampshire in 1914.

==First World War==
The company made more than 16,000 aircraft during the First World War. Many more of the company&#x27;s aircraft were built by subcontractors rather than by Sopwith themselves. These included Fairey, Clayton and Shuttleworth, William Beardmore and Company and Ruston Proctor.

Towards the end of the war, Sopwith took out a lease on &quot;National Aircraft Factory No.2&quot;, constructed in 26 weeks during the winter of 1917 a mile to the north of the Canbury works in Ham. The company were able to greatly increase production of Snipe, Dolphin and Salamander fighter planes as a result. At the beginning of the war the company had 200 employees; this had reached 6,000 employees by the Armistice.

==Post-war diversification and failure==
After the war, the company attempted to produce aircraft for the civil market based on their wartime types. These included aircraft such as a single-winged Camel and the Dove, a derivative of the Pup and the Swallow, but the wide availability of war-surplus aircraft at knock-down prices meant this was never economical. In 1919 the company was renamed as Sopwith Aviation &amp; Engineering Company and the factory was re-organised to produce ABC motorcycles under licence; this included an investment of £100,000 in new machinery. In September 1920 the Kingston factory closed for stocktaking and the company decided to enter voluntary liquidation; the works manager at Kingston announced in a letter to the 1400 employees:

At a meeting of creditors held in October 1920 it was explained that although the company had previously accumulated a surplus of £900,000 in 1918, following a slump in the sale of motorcycles the company had liabilities of £705,430 (which included £583,510 for excess profits duty) and assets of £862,630. The amount of excess profit duty was being disputed by the company which had already paid £450,000 in duty. The meeting concluded that the best result would be to sell the business as a going concern.

The Ham factory, which was included in 38 acres of freehold land, was sold to Leyland Motors. The newly formed H.G. Hawker Engineering Company obtained the Sopwith patent rights and a government contract to refurbish Sopwith Snipe biplanes.

==Hawker Engineering==
Upon the liquidation of the Sopwith company, Tom Sopwith himself, together with Harry Hawker, Fred Sigrist and Bill Eyre, immediately formed H.G. Hawker Engineering, forerunner of the Hawker Aircraft and Hawker Siddeley lineage. Sopwith was Chairman of Hawker Siddeley until his retirement. Hawker and its successors produced many more famous military aircraft, including the inter-war Hart, and Demon; World War II&#x27;s Hurricane, Typhoon, and Tempest; and the post-war Sea Fury, Hunter and Harrier. These later jet types were manufactured in the same factory buildings used to produce Sopwith Snipes in 1918 as Hawker Aircraft bought the Ham Factory when Leyland&#x27;s lease expired in 1948.

== Present day ==

In 2021, the Sopwith Aviation name was acquired by Bevan Davidson International based in Swaffham, Norfolk, who plan to release a line of celebratory motor vehicles in celebration of the history of Sopwith. A two-seater sports car, styled and named after the Sopwith Dove was revealed at the London Concours car show later that year.

==Famous Sopwith aircraft==

Initially, Tom Sopwith himself, assisted by his former personal mechanic Fred Sigrist, led the design of the company&#x27;s types. Following a number of pre-war designs for the Royal Naval Air Service, such as the Three-seater and the Bat Boat, Sopwith&#x27;s first major success was the fast and compact (hence the name) Tabloid, a design which first showed the influence of the company&#x27;s test pilot, the Australian Harry Hawker. A float-equipped version of this aircraft won the Schneider Trophy in 1914. The landplane version was used by both the RNAS and RFC at the start of the war. With higher power and floats, the type evolved into the Sopwith Baby, which was a workhorse of the RNAS for much of the First World War.

In 1916, Herbert Smith became Chief Engineer of the Sopwith company, and under his design leadership its other successful World War I types included the larger Type 9901. This aircraft, better known as the 1½ Strutter due to its unconventional cabane strut arrangement, was used from 1916 by the RNAS, RFC and the French &quot;Aviation Militaire&quot; as a single-seat bomber, two-seat fighter and artillery spotter and trainer. Soon after came the small and agile single-seat Scout, which quickly became better known as the Pup because of its obvious descent from the 1½ Strutter. The Pup and 1½ Strutter were the first successful British tractor fighters equipped with a synchronisation gear to allow a machine gun to fire through the rotating propeller. This gear was known as the Sopwith-Kauper gear from its designers, although several other designs were used later. The Pup was widely used on the Western Front by the RFC and from ships by the RNAS from the autumn of 1916 to the early summer of 1917, and was considered a delight to fly by its pilots. It continued in use as an advanced trainer for the remainder of the War. The Pup began the famous series of &quot;animal&quot;-named Sopwith aircraft during the war, which, as a whole, would become renowned in aviation history as &quot;The Flying Zoo&quot;.

Experimentally equipped with three narrow-chord wings and a more powerful engine, the Pup led to the Triplane, which was used by just four squadrons of the RNAS during 1917, but became well known for its startling fighting qualities, put to best use by Raymond Collishaw&#x27;s famous &#x27;Black Flight&#x27; of &#x27;Naval 10&#x27; (No. 10 Squadron RNAS). This flight was so called due to the black identification colour of the flight&#x27;s aircraft, which in turn led to their naming as Black Maria, Black Prince, Black Death, Black Roger and Black Sheep. Such was the impact of this type that it spawned a large number of experimental triplane designs from manufacturers on all sides, although only the Fokker Triplane achieved any subsequent success.
In the early summer of 1917, the twin-gun Camel fighter was introduced. This aircraft was highly manoeuvrable and well-armed, and over 5,000 were produced up until the end of the War. It destroyed more enemy aircraft than any other British type, but its difficult flying qualities also killed very many novice pilots in accidents. It was used, modified, as both a night-fighter and shipboard aircraft, and was flown in combat by the Belgian and American Air Services as well as the British.

Later still in front-line service came the stationary-engined four-gun Dolphin and the ultimate rotary-engined fighter, the Snipe. The Snipe saw little wartime service, being issued only in small numbers to the Front, but William George Barker, the Canadian ace, won a Victoria Cross flying one in an epic single-handed dogfight against enormous odds.

Towards the end of the war, the company produced the Cuckoo torpedo-bomber and the Salamander armoured ground-attack development of the Snipe, but these types were too late to see action. Many other experimental prototypes were produced throughout the war, mostly named after animals (Hippo, Gnu etc.), leading to some referring to the &#x27;Sopwith Zoo&#x27;.

Following World War I, the Sopwith Snipe was chosen as the standard fighter of the much-reduced Royal Air Force, and soldiered on until finally replaced in the late 1920s.

<text>Stanford Law School (SLS) is the law school of Stanford University, a private research university near Palo Alto, California. Established in 1893, Stanford Law had an acceptance rate of 6.28% in 2021, the second-lowest of any law school in the country. George Triantis currently serves as Dean. 

Stanford Law School employs more than 90 full-time and part-time faculty members and enrolls over 550 students who are working toward their Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree. Stanford Law also confers four advanced legal degrees: a Master of Laws (LL.M.), a Master of Studies in Law (M.S.L.), a Master of the Science of Law (J.S.M.), and a Doctor of the Science of Law (J.S.D.). Each fall, Stanford Law enrolls a J.D. class of approximately 180 students, giving Stanford the smallest student body of any law school ranked in the top fourteen (T14). Stanford also maintains eleven full-time legal clinics, including the nation&#x27;s first and most active Supreme Court litigation clinic, and offers 27 formal joint degree programs.

==History==
Stanford first offered a curriculum in legal studies in 1893, when the university hired its first two law professors: former U.S. president Benjamin Harrison and Nathan Abbott - who attended Boston University School of Law. Abbott headed the new program and assembled a small faculty over the next few years. The law department primarily enrolled undergraduate majors at this time and included a large number of students who might not have been welcome at more traditional law schools at the time, including women and students of color, especially Hispanic, Chinese and Japanese students.

In 1900, the department moved from its original location in Encina Hall to the northeast side of the Inner Quadrangle. These larger facilities included Stanford&#x27;s first law library. Beginning to focus more on professional training, the school implemented its first three-year curriculum and became one of 27 charter members of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS). In 1901, the school awarded its first professional degree, the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.).

Starting in 1908, the law department began its transition into an exclusively professional school when Stanford&#x27;s Board of Trustees passed a resolution to officially change its name from Law Department to Law School. Eight years later, Frederic Campbell Woodward became the first dean of the law school, and in 1923, the law school received accreditation from the American Bar Association (ABA). In 1924, Stanford&#x27;s law program officially transitioned into a modern professional school when it began requiring a bachelor&#x27;s degree for admission.

The 1940s and 1950s brought considerable change to the law school. After World War II caused the law school&#x27;s enrollment to drop to fewer than 30 students, the school quickly expanded once the war ended in 1945. A move to a new location in the Outer Quadrangle, as well as the 1948 opening of the law school dormitory Crothers Hall (the result of a donation by Stanford Law graduate George E. Crothers), allowed the school to grow, while the 1948 inaugural publication of the &quot;Stanford Law Review&quot; (helmed by future U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher &#x27;49) helped to augment the law school&#x27;s national reputation. The decision that Stanford should remain a small law school with a very limited enrollment emerged during this period. For the third time in its history, the law school relocated in the 1970s, this time to its current location in the Crown Quadrangle.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the law school aimed to diversify its student body. During this period, students established a large number of new and progressive student organizations, including the Women of Stanford Law, the Stanford Chicano Law Student Association, the Environmental Law Society, and the Stanford Public Interest Foundation. Additionally, in 1966, the school sought to academically diversify its student body by collaborating with the Stanford Business School to create its first joint-degree program. A year earlier, in 1965, the law school enrolled its first black student, Sallyanne Payton &#x27;68, and in 1972, the school hired its first female law professor, Barbara Babcock, and its first professor of color, William B. Gould IV. In 1968, Stanford appointed Thelton Henderson, future judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as the first assistant dean for minority admissions. Henderson expanded minority enrollment from a single student to approximately a fifth of the student body. Stanford Law&#x27;s commitment to diversity continues today, and &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; currently ranks Stanford Law as one of the ten best law schools for minority students.

Earning national recognition in the 1980s and 1990s, the law school embarked on innovating its curriculum. Stanford offered new courses focusing on law and technology, environmental law, intellectual property law, and international law, allowing students to specialize in emerging legal fields. In 1984, it launched its first clinical program, the East Palo Alto Community Law Project. By the 21st century, a new focus on interdisciplinary education emerged. In 2009, it transitioned from a semester system to a quarter system to align itself with Stanford&#x27;s other graduate schools. Stanford also expanded its upper-level offerings in international law, by adding new clinics, academic centers, and simulation courses, and expanded its joint degree programs.

==Academics and admissions==
Stanford Law School is known for its student-to-faculty ratio (4.3 to 1), one of the lowest in the country. The first-year class of approximately 180 students is divided into six smaller sections of 30 students each.

The academic program is flexible. First-year students (or 1Ls) are required to take Civil Procedure, Contracts, Torts, and Legal Research &amp; Writing during the autumn quarter, and Criminal Law, Constitutional Law, Federal Litigation, and one elective during the winter quarter. In the spring quarter, they take Federal Litigation, Property, and enroll in electives. Stanford Law offers 280 course titles beyond the first-year curriculum, and advanced courses range from White-Collar Crime to a Supreme Court Simulation Seminar. Additionally, because of the law school&#x27;s proximity to other academic programs on campus, there is a strong focus on joint-degree programs and interdisciplinary learning, and upper-level students may take classes at Stanford&#x27;s other professional and graduate schools.

Stanford Law enables second- and third-year students to gain hands-on experience by working full-time in one of eleven legal clinics, including an Environmental Law Clinic, Criminal Defense Clinic, a Religious Liberty Clinic, and an Intellectual Property and Innovation Clinic. The Supreme Court Litigation Clinic has successfully brought over thirty cases before the Court, making it one of the most active Supreme Court practices of any kind. The clinic has served as lead counsel or co-lead counsel on the merits in numerous cases, including &quot;Kennedy v. Louisiana&quot; (2008), &quot;Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts&quot; (2009), &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; (2013), &quot;Riley v. California&quot; (2014), and &quot;Bourke v. Beshear&quot; (2015).

Launched in 2013, Stanford&#x27;s Law and Policy Lab provides further opportunities for experiential learning. The Policy Lab allows second- and third-year students to enroll in faculty-supervised policy practicums, where students work in small teams to conduct policy research and analysis for real-world clients. Topics have ranged from wildlife trafficking to prison realignment to copyright reform, and prior clients include California Attorney General Kamala Harris, Governor of California Jerry Brown, the California Law Revision Commission, the U.S. Copyright Office, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Students and alumni routinely report high satisfaction with their academic experience. In surveys conducted by &quot;Above the Law&quot;, Stanford Law received an &quot;A+&quot; from both students and alumni for their satisfaction with Stanford&#x27;s academic program, and the law school also received an &quot;A+&quot; rating from students for practical/clinical training, career counseling, and financial aid advising. Based on surveys with students at the nation&#x27;s 169 best law schools, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; currently ranks Stanford Law as having the best &quot;Classroom Experience&quot;, and students provided Stanford with the highest score (99) for its &quot;Academic Experience Rating&quot; and &quot;Professors Interesting Rating&quot;. Additionally, the 2014 &quot;Midlevel Associates Survey&quot; conducted by &quot;The American Lawyer&quot; magazine found that based on mid-level associates&#x27; assessments of their legal education, Stanford Law placed in the top five law schools for effectively preparing its graduates for law firm life.

Outside of the classroom, Stanford Law students run over fifty student organizations and publish seven legal journals. The most influential journal is the &quot;Stanford Law Review&quot;, which has been ranked as the top law review by the &quot;Washington &amp; Lee Law Review Rankings&quot; in both 2013 and 2014. Advocacy skills are tested in the Marion Rice Kirkwood Moot Court competition.

The Robert Crown Law Library at Stanford holds 500,000 books, 360,000 microform and audiovisual items, and more than 8,000 current serial subscriptions.

In August 2008, Stanford Law School changed its grading system, which no longer relies on traditional letter grades, joining Yale Law School, the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, and Harvard Law School. Students now receive one of four grades: honors, pass, restricted credit, or no credit. Unlike Harvard Law School and Yale Law School, Stanford Law School enforces strict curves which cap the number of honors grades to around 30%. As part of Stanford&#x27;s grade reform, the law school no longer awards the honors of the Order of the Coif or Graduation with Distinction.

Between 4,000 and 5,000 students apply for admission each year. Selection is competitive: the median undergraduate grade point average of admitted students is 3.92 and the median LSAT score is 173 (out of 180). Beyond numbers, Stanford places considerable emphasis on factors such as extracurricular activities, work experience, and prior graduate study. About three quarters of the members of each entering class have one or more years of prior work experience and over a quarter have another graduate degree. The school also accepts a small number of transfers each year.

==Bar passage rates==

According to ABA Required Disclosures, Stanford Law School had an average bar passage rate of 94.41% in 2022.

In 2023, 94% of Stanford Law graduates passed the California Bar on their first attempt, the highest pass rate of all California law schools.

==Post-graduation employment==
Upon graduation, about a third of the class clerks for a judge; about half join law firms.

According to Stanford Law School&#x27;s official 2014 ABA-required disclosures, 90.4% of the Class of 2014 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation, excluding solo-practitioners. Stanford&#x27;s Law School Transparency under-employment score is 3.2%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2014 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.

According to the American Bar Association, of 2014 Stanford Law graduates, 90.9% are employed in a position that required the graduate to pass the bar exam; 2.7% are employed in a position in which the employer sought an individual with a J.D. or in which the J.D. provided a demonstrable advantage in obtaining or performing the job, but which did not itself require an active law license; 2.7% are employed in other professional positions; 1.1% are pursuing graduate work full-time; 1.1% have a deferred employment starting date; and 1.6% are unemployed and seeking employment.

Despite its small size, Stanford Law has the third highest (per capita) placement rate for law professors at the nation&#x27;s 43 leading law schools, according to a 2011 study, and has achieved the second-highest (per capita) placement rate for U.S. Supreme Court clerkships, according to a 2013 finding. Stanford Law alumni have clerked for the U.S. Supreme Court every year for the past 40 years. Based on a 2012 to 2014 average, Stanford Law has also achieved the second-highest (per capita) placement rate for federal judicial clerkships, and for the class of 2014, reported the highest placement rate for federal judicial clerkships at 30.5%. Stanford Law currently has the highest percentage of its graduates clerking for federal judges of any law school in the United States.

==Costs==
The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Stanford Law School for the 2023–24 academic year is $112,364.

A 2015 study by M7 Financial, which assessed law schools&#x27; &quot;credit ratings&quot; using data on average starting salaries, employment trends, and student loan obligations, found that Stanford Law had the lowest student debt burden of any law school in the study.

<text>Coca Carola is a Swedish punk band formed in Åkersberga in 1986. 
Signed to the Swedish record label Beat Butchers, they were active and recognized in the Swedish punk scene during the years 1986–2004. In 2023, after a long hiatus, the band has begun to tour again.

==History==
At the beginning, the band consisted of musicians who had been fired from their previous bands: Curt &quot;Curre&quot; Sandgren (former member of the band &quot;Rolands Gosskör&quot;), Mårten Tolander, &quot;Ostron&quot; Åkerholm, and Björn Gullberg. in 1987, Coca Carola released a self-titled single, and after this Gullberg left the band. For a short time, Putte Strand joined the band as a guitarist. He was replaced by Conny Melkersson, who had played with Sandgren in the band &quot;Rolands Gosskör&quot;.

In 1988, Coca Carola, together with the band 23 Till, recorded their first LP titled &quot;Anabola Melodier&quot;. Coca Carola was responsible for the first half of the album.

In the summer of 1991, Coca Carola released the single &quot;C/C 7 Inch&quot;; the three songs on this single used English-language lyrics. Busy with his other band NEIN, Melkersson left the band. Coca Carola found a new guitarist, Jonas Winberg. In the fall of 1992, the band&#x27;s debut album titled &quot;Tigger &amp; Ber&quot; was released, and the band toured Germany. They played at the Hultsfred Festival and toured with De lyckliga kompisarna.

In January 1994, Coca Carola released their second album, &quot;Läckert&quot;. Later that year, bassist Åkerholm left the band because it was taking too much of his time. Since the band had planned to release a single in the fall of 1994, Åke Noring (also from Rolands Gosskör) temporarily played bass in Coca Carola. Jonas Mellberg, who was a member of the band &quot;Håkan sover naken&quot; joined Coca Carola, and remained their bass player until 2004.

In September 1994, Coca Carola released the EP &quot;Klubben för inbördes beundran&quot;, whose first track, &quot;Inbördes beundran&quot;, reached 37th place on the Swedish singles charts.

In early 1996, Coca Carola released their third album, &quot;Dagar kommer&quot;. For the band&#x27;s 10th anniversary later that year, the collection &quot;...Fem år till moped&quot; was released. This album contained several new songs, as well as older rare tracks. In 1997, the band took a hiatus, but returned in 1998 with a new album &quot;Så Fel Som Bara Vi Kan Ha&quot;.

In December 1998, Coca Carola received a request to write songs for a compilation album for the soccer team Djurgården&#x27;s IF. The band accepted, and wrote nine new songs, including &quot;Min tröja&quot;.

In 2000, their fifth studio album was recorded and released, &quot;Feber&quot;. In 2004, Coca Carola released their most recent album &quot;Kryp din Jävel&quot; and played their final gig at &quot;Fregatten&quot; in Åkersberga. Soon after that, Curre Sandgren and Jonas Mellberg started a new band, called &quot;Den sista leken&quot;, which released an album the same year.

In 2012, Coca Carola reunited for a gig at the festival Peace &amp; Love in Borlänge and for an unpublicized concert at Kafé 44 in Stockholm. The following year, they played with Charta 77 and Johan Johansson, among others, at an event in Stockholm; this performance was dedicated to the Peace &amp; Love festival, which had gone bankrupt.

In 2023, Coca Carola started to play again regularly. Their reunion concert took place at &quot;The Public&quot; in their hometown of Åkersberga in January 2023. In February 2023, the band participated in &quot;Ögir will arise&quot; at Frimis in Örebro, a benefit to support the rebuilding of Per Granberg&#x27;s music bar Ögir, which burned down in 2022. Coca Carola&#x27;s next gig in August 2023 was even larger: at Gröna Lund. This performance included Jonas Mellberg was a guest artist.
In 2024, Coca Carola have committed to a benefit concert for guitarrist Micke Blomquist, organized by Asta Kask.

<text>Bengali poetry is a rich tradition of poetry in the Bengali language and has many different forms. Originating in Bengal, the history of Bengali poetry underwent three successive stages of development: poetry of the early age (like &quot;Charyapad&quot;), the Medieval period and the age of modern poetry. All ages have seen different forms of poetry and poetical tradition. It reached the pinnacle during the Bengali Renaissance period although it has a rich tradition and has grown independent of the movement. Major Bengali Poets throughout the ages are Chandidas, Alaol, Ramprasad Sen, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Nabinchandra Sen, Rabindranath Tagore, Dwijendralal Ray, Satyendranath Dutta, Kazi Nazrul Islam, Jibanananda Das, Jasimuddin, Sukanta Battacharya, Al Mahmud.

==Introduction==

Poetry in the colloquial dialect of Bengal first originated from Prakrit, and based upon local socio-cultural traditions. It was antagonistic towards Vedic rituals and laws as opposed to the sahajaya traditions of the poets themselves - who were mainly Buddhist sages.

The medieval period marked the introduction of , which played an important role in Muslim life and brought much Persian and Arabic influence to the poetic lexicon. Shah Gharibullah was said to have initiated this trend with his epic &quot;Amir Hamza&quot;. Many , based on battles, were written during this time. Jongonamas were generally elegiac in tone. Works relating to Karbala were called (meaning &#x27;grief&#x27; in Arabic) literature. Both janganama and marsiya literature first developed in Arabia and later Persia. Muslim Sufis and soldiers introduced this form of poetry in the Bengali language to the masses in Bengal and Arakan. Well-known poems of include Zainab&#x27;s Chautisha by Sheikh Faizullah, Maqtul Husayn by Mohammad Khan and Qasim-er Lodai O Fatima-r Surotnama by Sherbaz. The works mixed Bengali folk poetry with Perso-Arabian stories and themes, and are considered an important part of the Muslim culture of Bengal.

== Ancient and medieval eras ==

Charyapad is the oldest poetry and literary specimen of Bengali language. It is also the oldest work in the neo-Indian Aryan language. The composers of these hymns, composed between the tenth and twelfth centuries AD, were easily Buddhist Siddhacharyas. The 24 major Charyapadas were by Lui Pa, Kukkuripa, Biruapa, Gundaripa, Chatilpa, Bhusuk Pa, Kahnpa, Kambalambarpa, Dombipa, Shantipa, Mahittapa, Veenapa, Sarhapa, Shabar Pa, Azdebpa, Dhenpana, Dankapa, Darikpa Dhampa, Tantripa, Laridombipa.
1200-1350 AD of Bengali literature has been marked as the &quot;dark age of Bengali Literature.&quot; During this time Srikrishnakirtan was composed by Baduchandidas.The other remarkable poets of Vaishnava literature of this era were Vidyapati, Jnandas, Govindadas, Yashoraj Khan, Chandkaji, Ramchandra Basu, Balram Das, Narhari Das, Vrindavan Das, Basudavas, Bansibad. Syed Sultan, Harhari Sarkar, Fateh Paramananda, Ghanshyam Das, Gayas Khan, Alaol, Deen Chandidas, Chandrashekhar, Haridas, Shivram, Karam Ali, Pir Muhammad, Hiramani, Bhavananda. Famous poets of Mangal Kavya are Kanahari Dutt, Narayan Dev, Vijaygupta, Bipradas Piplai, Madhav Acharya, Mukundaram Chakraborty, Ghanram Chakraborty, Srishyam Pandit, Bharat Chandra Roy Gunakar, Khemananda, Ketka Das Khemananda, Dwij Madhav, Adi Rupram, Manik Ram, Mayur Bhatt, Khelaram, Rupram, Sitaram Das, Shyamj.

The 18th-century two brilliant Shakta bhakti court poets were Bharatchandra Ray and Ramprasad Sen.

== Modern poets (1800–present) ==
The poets who built the bridge between the Middle and Modern Ages is the poet of the Ages:Ishwar Chandra Gupta (1812–1859), he is also regarded as the Father of the Modern Bengali Language. Michael Madhusudan Dutt (1824–1873) broke the medieval paradigm and Bengali poetry entered free verse - he is especially popular for his Bengali sonnets. Biharilal Chakraborty (1835–1894) who was a romantic and lyric poet of European style also contributed to the shift.

Kabiguru Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) was arguably the most revolutionary poets of Bengali Literature. He contributed to every branch of Bengali Literature including poetry. He broke down the old custom of writing in &quot;Sadhu&quot; language in poetry and introduced an aspect of poetry which had more freedom to the poet. He composed over two-thousand songs - which are known as &quot;Rabindra Sangeet&quot; and they are popular in West Bengal and Bangladesh even today. His songs &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot; and &quot;Amar Sonar Bangla&quot; are the National Anthems of India and Bangladesh respectively. His impact on Bengali Literature is so immense that all Bengali Literature during his lifetime is known as the &quot;Rabindric Era&quot;, after his name. The contemporary poets of the Rabindric era were Satyendranath Dutta, Kamini Ray, Updendrakishore Raychowdhury, Sukumar Ray, Jatindra Mohan Bagchi among others. The death of Rabindranath Tagore is often considered to be the end of Classical Poetry and the start of Modern Poetry.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, there was a new change in Bengali style of poetry, with poets adopting an even liberal style of poetry, bringing an end to Bengali Romanticism. Poets such as Mohitlal Majumder, Kazi Nazrul Islam and Jatindranath Sengupta beginning contributed to this period. &quot;Bidrohi Kavi&quot; Kazi Nazrul Islam is considered to be the bridge between the Anti-Romantic Period and the Modern Period of Poetry. He had composed a vast oeuvre of poetry and songs – the latter of which are known as &quot;Nazrul Geeti&quot; which are sung even today. Nazrul is also the National Poet of Bangladesh. His poem &quot;Bidrohi&quot; had a big impact on the Indian Freedom Movement.

The death of Tagore led to the beginning of the Golden Age of Modern Poetry, which lasted from the 1940s to the 60s. Numerous poets left their profound impact on poetry in this era, such as:Amiya Chakraborty (1901–1966), Jibanananda Das (1899–1954), Buddhadeb Basu (1906–1964), Bishnu Dey (1909–1962), Sudhindranath Dutta (1901–1960), Sablu Shahabuddin (1957–1999).They were followed by the generation of Shakti Chattopadhyay (1933–1995), Sankha Ghosh (1932–2021),Tarapada Ray (1936–2007) Sunil Gangopadhyay (1935–2012) – known as Krittibas group of poets.

Jasimuddin&#x27;s work of Pastoral mood led him to be known as Palli Kabi. He was one of the major poets.

&quot;Hungryalist movement&quot; also emerged in Bengal that was consisted with new bunch of poets in Bengal, inducing Malay Roy Choudhury and Purusottam Kumar Debnath

== Poets of West Bengal and Bangladesh ==
Following the Partition of India in 1947, Bengali poets were divided along nationalistic lines of India and Pakistan. West Bengal still had a great literary culture around it. Many Poets like Shakti Chattopadhyay, Binoy Majumdar, Samir Roychoudhury, Malay Roy Choudhury, Subimal Basak, Pranabkumar Chattopadhyay, Subodh Sarkar emerged.

The poets of East Bengal took different yet similar path, many taking inspiration from Kazi Nazrul Islam and other major poets. Some of the popular Bengali Muslim poets of this period included Farrukh Ahmad, Talim Hossain, Golam Mostofa and Raushan Yazdani. The Bangladesh Liberation War and struggle for freedom became a popular theme in the years that followed. Al Mahmud is considered one of the greatest Bengali poets to have emerged in the 20th century.

<doc id="382445" wikidata="Q3984053" url="?curid=382445" title="Fourier inversion theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Fourier inversion theorem says that for many types of functions it is possible to recover a function from its Fourier transform. Intuitively it may be viewed as the statement that if we know all frequency and phase information about a wave then we may reconstruct the original wave precisely.

The theorem says that if we have a function formula_1 satisfying certain conditions, and we use the convention for the Fourier transform that 

:formula_2

then

:formula_3

In other words, the theorem says that 

:formula_4

This last equation is called the Fourier integral theorem.

Another way to state the theorem is that if formula_5 is the flip operator i.e. formula_6, then 

:formula_7

The theorem holds if both formula_8 and its Fourier transform are absolutely integrable (in the Lebesgue sense) and formula_8 is continuous at the point formula_10. However, even under more general conditions versions of the Fourier inversion theorem hold. In these cases the integrals above may not converge in an ordinary sense.

==Statement==

In this section we assume that formula_8 is an integrable continuous function. Use the convention for the Fourier transform that 

:formula_12

Furthermore, we assume that the Fourier transform is also integrable.

===Inverse Fourier transform as an integral===

The most common statement of the Fourier inversion theorem is to state the inverse transform as an integral. For any integrable function formula_13 and all formula_14 set

:formula_15

Then for all formula_14 we have

:formula_17
Given formula_18 and formula_19, the proof uses the following facts:

# If formula_20 and formula_21, then formula_22
# If formula_23 and formula_24, then formula_25
# For formula_26, Fubini&#x27;s theorem implies formula_27
# Define formula_28 such that formula_29
# Define formula_30; an approximation to the identity. That is, formula_31 converges pointwise for any continuous formula_32 and point formula_20.
Since, by assumption, formula_34, it follows by the dominated convergence theorem that
formula_35
Define
formula_36
Applying facts 1, 2 and 4, repeatedly for multiple integrals if necessary, we obtain
formula_37
Using fact 3 on formula_8 and formula_39, for each formula_40, we have
formula_41
the convolution of formula_8 with an approximate identity. But since formula_32, fact 5 says that
formula_44
Putting together the above we have shown that
formula_45

===Fourier integral theorem===

The theorem can be restated as 

:formula_46

By taking the real part of each side of the above we obtain 

:formula_47

===Inverse transform in terms of flip operator===

For any function formula_13 define the flip operator formula_5 by

:formula_50

Then we may instead define 

:formula_51

It is immediate from the definition of the Fourier transform and the flip operator that both formula_52 and formula_53 match the integral definition of formula_54, and in particular are equal to each other and satisfy formula_55.

Since formula_56 we have formula_57 and

:formula_58

===Two-sided inverse===

The form of the Fourier inversion theorem stated above, as is common, is that

:formula_59

In other words, formula_60 is a left inverse for the Fourier transform. However it is also a right inverse for the Fourier transform i.e.

:formula_61

Since formula_60 is so similar to formula_63, this follows very easily from the Fourier inversion theorem (changing variables formula_64):

:formula_65

Alternatively, this can be seen from the relation between formula_54 and the flip operator and the associativity of function composition, since

:formula_67

==Conditions on the function==

When used in physics and engineering, the Fourier inversion theorem is often used under the assumption that everything &quot;behaves nicely&quot;. In mathematics such heuristic arguments are not permitted, and the Fourier inversion theorem includes an explicit specification of what class of functions is being allowed. However, there is no &quot;best&quot; class of functions to consider so several variants of the Fourier inversion theorem exist, albeit with compatible conclusions.

===Schwartz functions===

The Fourier inversion theorem holds for all Schwartz functions (roughly speaking, smooth functions that decay quickly and whose derivatives all decay quickly). This condition has the benefit that it is an elementary direct statement about the function (as opposed to imposing a condition on its Fourier transform), and the integral that defines the Fourier transform and its inverse are absolutely integrable. This version of the theorem is used in the proof of the Fourier inversion theorem for tempered distributions (see below).

===Integrable functions with integrable Fourier transform===

The Fourier inversion theorem holds for all continuous functions that are absolutely integrable (i.e. formula_68) with absolutely integrable Fourier transform. This includes all Schwartz functions, so is a strictly stronger form of the theorem than the previous one mentioned. This condition is the one used above in the statement section.

A slight variant is to drop the condition that the function formula_69 be continuous but still require that it and its Fourier transform be absolutely integrable. Then formula_70 almost everywhere where is a continuous function, and formula_71 for every formula_20.

===Integrable functions in one dimension===

; Piecewise smooth; one dimension
If the function is absolutely integrable in one dimension (i.e. formula_73) and is piecewise smooth then a version of the Fourier inversion theorem holds. In this case we define

:formula_74

Then for all formula_75

:formula_76

i.e. formula_77 equals the average of the left and right limits of formula_78 at formula_79. At points where formula_78 is continuous this simply equals formula_81.

A higher-dimensional analogue of this form of the theorem also holds, but according to Folland (1992) is &quot;rather delicate and not terribly useful&quot;.

; Piecewise continuous; one dimension

If the function is absolutely integrable in one dimension (i.e. formula_73) but merely piecewise continuous then a version of the Fourier inversion theorem still holds. In this case the integral in the inverse Fourier transform is defined with the aid of a smooth rather than a sharp cut off function; specifically we define

:formula_83

The conclusion of the theorem is then the same as for the piecewise smooth case discussed above.

; Continuous; any number of dimensions

If formula_78 is continuous and absolutely integrable on formula_85 then the Fourier inversion theorem still holds so long as we again define the inverse transform with a smooth cut off function i.e. 

:formula_86

The conclusion is now simply that for all formula_20

:formula_17

; No regularity condition; any number of dimensions

If we drop all assumptions about the (piecewise) continuity of formula_8 and assume merely that it is absolutely integrable, then a version of the theorem still holds. The inverse transform is again defined with the smooth cut off, but with the conclusion that 

:formula_90 

for almost every formula_91

===Square integrable functions===

In this case the Fourier transform cannot be defined directly as an integral since it may not be absolutely convergent, so it is instead defined by a density argument (see the Fourier transform article). For example, putting 
:formula_92
we can set formula_93 where the limit is taken in the formula_94-norm. The inverse transform may be defined by density in the same way or by defining it in terms of the Fourier transform and the flip operator. We then have

:formula_95 

in the mean squared norm. In one dimension (and one dimension only), it can also be shown that it converges for almost every - this is Carleson&#x27;s theorem, but is much harder to prove than convergence in the mean squared norm.

===Tempered distributions===

The Fourier transform may be defined on the space of tempered distributions formula_96 by duality of the Fourier transform on the space of Schwartz functions. Specifically for formula_97 and for all test functions formula_98 we set
:formula_99
where formula_100 is defined using the integral formula. If formula_101 then this agrees with the usual definition. We may define the inverse transform formula_102, either by duality from the inverse transform on Schwartz functions in the same way, or by defining it in terms of the flip operator (where the flip operator is defined by duality). We then have

:formula_103

==Relation to Fourier series==

The Fourier inversion theorem is analogous to the convergence of Fourier series. In the Fourier transform case we have
:formula_104
:formula_105
:formula_106
In the Fourier series case we instead have
:formula_107
:formula_108
:formula_109

In particular, in one dimension formula_110 and the sum runs from formula_111 to formula_112.

==Applications==

In applications of the Fourier transform the Fourier inversion theorem often plays a critical role. In many situations the basic strategy is to apply the Fourier transform, perform some operation or simplification, and then apply the inverse Fourier transform. 

More abstractly, the Fourier inversion theorem is a statement about the Fourier transform as an operator (see Fourier transform on function spaces). For example, the Fourier inversion theorem on formula_113 shows that the Fourier transform is a unitary operator on formula_114.

<doc id="382447" wikidata="Q1418327" url="?curid=382447" title="Trivial topology">
<text>In topology, a topological space with the trivial topology is one where the only open sets are the empty set and the entire space. Such spaces are commonly called indiscrete, anti-discrete, concrete or codiscrete. Intuitively, this has the consequence that all points of the space are &quot;lumped together&quot; and cannot be distinguished by topological means. Every indiscrete space is a pseudometric space in which the distance between any two points is zero.

==Details==
The trivial topology is the topology with the least possible number of open sets, namely the empty set and the entire space, since the definition of a topology requires these two sets to be open. Despite its simplicity, a space &quot;X&quot; with more than one element and the trivial topology lacks a key desirable property: it is not a T0 space.

Other properties of an indiscrete space &quot;X&quot;—many of which are quite unusual—include:

* The only closed sets are the empty set and &quot;X&quot;.
* The only possible basis of &quot;X&quot; is {&quot;X&quot;}.
* If &quot;X&quot; has more than one point, then since it is not T0, it does not satisfy any of the higher T axioms either. In particular, it is not a Hausdorff space. Not being Hausdorff, &quot;X&quot; is not an order topology, nor is it metrizable.
* &quot;X&quot; is, however, regular, completely regular, normal, and completely normal; all in a rather vacuous way though, since the only closed sets are ∅ and &quot;X&quot;.
* &quot;X&quot; is compact and therefore paracompact, Lindelöf, and locally compact.
* Every function whose domain is a topological space and codomain &quot;X&quot; is continuous.
* &quot;X&quot; is path-connected and so connected.
* &quot;X&quot; is second-countable, and therefore is first-countable, separable and Lindelöf.
* All subspaces of &quot;X&quot; have the trivial topology.
* All quotient spaces of &quot;X&quot; have the trivial topology
* Arbitrary products of trivial topological spaces, with either the product topology or box topology, have the trivial topology.
* All sequences in &quot;X&quot; converge to every point of &quot;X&quot;. In particular, every sequence has a convergent subsequence (the whole sequence or any other subsequence), thus &quot;X&quot; is sequentially compact.
* The interior of every set except &quot;X&quot; is empty.
* The closure of every non-empty subset of &quot;X&quot; is &quot;X&quot;. Put another way: every non-empty subset of &quot;X&quot; is dense, a property that characterizes trivial topological spaces.
** As a result of this, the closure of every open subset &quot;U&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is either ∅ (if &quot;U&quot; = ∅) or &quot;X&quot; (otherwise). In particular, the closure of every open subset of &quot;X&quot; is again an open set, and therefore &quot;X&quot; is extremally disconnected.
* If &quot;S&quot; is any subset of &quot;X&quot; with more than one element, then all elements of &quot;X&quot; are limit points of &quot;S&quot;. If &quot;S&quot; is a singleton, then every point of &quot;X&quot; \ &quot;S&quot; is still a limit point of &quot;S&quot;.
* &quot;X&quot; is a Baire space.
* Two topological spaces carrying the trivial topology are homeomorphic iff they have the same cardinality.

In some sense the opposite of the trivial topology is the discrete topology, in which every subset is open.

The trivial topology belongs to a uniform space in which the whole cartesian product &quot;X&quot; × &quot;X&quot; is the only entourage.

Let Top be the category of topological spaces with continuous maps and Set be the category of sets with functions. If &quot;G&quot; : Top → Set is the functor that assigns to each topological space its underlying set (the so-called forgetful functor), and &quot;H&quot; : Set → Top is the functor that puts the trivial topology on a given set, then &quot;H&quot; (the so-called cofree functor) is right adjoint to &quot;G&quot;. (The so-called free functor &quot;F&quot; : Set → Top that puts the discrete topology on a given set is left adjoint to &quot;G&quot;.)

<text>Engativá is the 10th locality of Bogotá. It is located in the west of the city. This district is mostly inhabited by lower middle and working class residents.

== Etymology ==
Engativá is either derived from &quot;Ingativá&quot;; &quot;cacique&quot; Inga; &quot;Land of the Sun&quot;, or from the Chibcha words &quot;Engue-tivá&quot;; &quot;engue&quot; is &quot;delicious&quot; and &quot;tivá&quot; is &quot;captain&quot;; &quot;captain of the delicious [people]&quot;.

== Geography ==
Engativá is limited to the north by the Salitre River with Suba, to the east by Avenida Carrera 68 and Bosa, to the south by Avenida El Dorado and Fontibón, and to the west by the Bogotá River.

== History ==
Engativá was a village in the confederation of the Muisca. Modern Engativá was founded in 1537. It has become a rural territory, people used to work as farmers of Bogotá in 1571. The church of the town was built in honor of the pope Clemente XII in 1638 and from 1737 it was named the Nuestra Señora de los Dolores&#x27;s Sanctuary. The church was destroyed by earthquakes, but was rebuilt in 1960.

<text>Primrose Hill is a Grade II listed public park located north of Regent&#x27;s Park in London, England, first opened to the public in 1842. It was named after the natural hill in the centre of the park, one of the highest natural points in the London Borough of Camden. The hill summit has a clear view of central London, as well as Hampstead and Belsize Park to the north and is adorned by an engraved quotation from William Blake. Based on the popularity of the park, the surrounding district and electoral ward were named Primrose Hill. The Primrose Hill district is in the London Borough of Camden, England.

Amenities of the park include an outdoor gym known as the Hill Trim Trail, a children&#x27;s playground, and toilets, all located on the south side near Primrose Hill bridge which connects to London Zoo and Regent&#x27;s Park.

==History==

Like the Regent&#x27;s Park, Primrose Hill was once part of a great chase appropriated by Henry VIII. Later, in 1841, it became Crown property and in 1842 an Act of Parliament secured the land as public open space. The name &quot;Primrose Hill&quot; has been in use since the 15th century, giving the lie to later claims that it was named after Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, whose premiership witnessed the rapid expansion of London underground rail network London.

In October 1678, Primrose Hill was the scene of the mysterious murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey. In 1679 three Catholic labourers, Robert Green, Henry Berry and Lawrence Hill were found guilty of the murder (though subsequently posthumously exonerated) and hanged at the top of the hill. For a few years after the hanging, Primrose Hill was known as Greenberry Hill. 

In 1792, Primrose Hill was the site of the first meeting of the &quot;Gorsedd of the Bards of the Isles of Britain&quot;, organised by the Welsh radical poet and antiquarian Iolo Morganwg. The Gorsedd (a community of bards) took place at a ceremony on 21 June (the summer solstice) and was designed to replicate ancient Druidic rites. A plaque commemorating this event was unveiled in 2009 by Huw Edwards on behalf of the London Welsh Association.

The canal through the area was completed in 1816, and the railway, running under the hill, was completed in 1838; this was the first rail tunnel in London. By that time, the area was considered to be a &quot;prime development opportunity&quot; according to one source. In 1840, Charles FitzRoy, 3rd Baron Southampton, sold the land that he owned and new villas were built over the subsequent years. Other land was still owned by Eton College but transferred to the government in 1841. The Crown drained and leveled the land after 1851 and began adding park features, to turn it into &quot;park for the people&quot;. The park was historically split between the ancient parishes (which later became metropolitan boroughs) of Marylebone (now part of the City of Westminster), St Pancras and Hampstead (in the modern London Borough of Camden), with the hill itself a part of Hampstead.

The area east of the park was developed and became known as Primrose Hill, after the park. The Primrose Hill district is surrounded by St John&#x27;s Wood to the west, Swiss Cottage to the northwest, Belsize Park to the north, Chalk Farm to the northeast, Camden Town to the east and Regent&#x27;s Park itself lies adjacent to the south of the hill itself. The nearest stations to Primrose Hill are Chalk Farm tube station to the northeast and Swiss Cottage tube station to the northwest. The defunct Primrose Hill railway station, now housing a business, sits on the railway lines that separate the Primrose Hill area from Camden Town. Primrose Hill Tunnel, the first railway tunnel in London, has had its eastern portals Grade II*- and its western portals Grade II* listed since 1974. Beginning in the late 1960s several of the roads were closed to motor traffic in response to an unacceptable level of collisions and consequent loss of life. The changes were carefully designed to render the area largely free of through motor traffic.
Crowds flocked to Primrose Hill following the loosening of lockdown restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic in London. Large amounts of litter were left around the park and social distancing was not observed. This resulted in the closure of Primrose Hill temporarily over a weekend.

, the Primrose Hill Open Space is managed by The Royal Parks.

==Notable buildings and residents==

The Primrose Hill district is an archetypal example of a successful London urban village, due to the location and the quality of its socio-historical development, and is home to many prominent residents. There are seven English Heritage blue plaques in Primrose Hill commemorating the historic personalities that have lived there.
The plaques mark the residences of poet Sir Hugh Clough, historian and broadcaster A. J. P. Taylor and painter William Roberts at 11, 13, and 14 St Mark&#x27;s Crescent respectively; revolutionary socialist and philosopher Friedrich Engels at 122 (and later 41) Regent&#x27;s Park Road; photographer Roger Fenton at 2 Albert Terrace; poet and novelist Sylvia Plath at 3 Chalcot Square; and poet William Butler Yeats at 23 Fitzroy Road.

Stanley Johnson and Lukas Heller each lived at different times at the &#x27;Rocking Horse House&#x27; on Regent&#x27;s Park Road.
Among those living in the area are broadcasters Joan Bakewell and Nicholas Crane, as well as actors Daisy Ridley, Derek Jacobi, and Brian Cox.

Elliott Square is a grouping of modernist 1960s houses by Douglas Streeter, built as part of the Chalcot Estate on land owned by Eton College.

<text>Graphics () are visual images or designs on some surface, such as a wall, canvas, screen, paper, or stone, to inform, illustrate, or entertain. In contemporary usage, it includes a pictorial representation of data, as in design and manufacture, in typesetting and the graphic arts, and in educational and recreational software. Images that are generated by a computer are called computer graphics.

Examples are photographs, drawings, line art, mathematical graphs, line graphs, charts, diagrams, typography, numbers, symbols, geometric designs, maps, engineering drawings, or other images. Graphics often combine text, illustration, and color. Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flyer, poster, web site, or book without any other element. The objective can be clarity or effective communication, association with other cultural elements, or merely the creation of a distinctive style.

Graphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred. It can also be used for architecture.

== History ==

The earliest graphics known to anthropologists studying prehistoric periods are cave paintings and markings on boulders, bone, ivory, and antlers, which were created during the Upper Palaeolithic period from 40,000 to 10,000 B.C. or earlier. Many of these were found to record astronomical, seasonal, and chronological details. Some of the earliest graphics and drawings are known to the modern world, from almost 6,000 years ago, are that of engraved stone tablets and ceramic cylinder seals, marking the beginning of the historical periods and the keeping of records for accounting and inventory purposes. Records from Egypt predate these and papyrus was used by the Egyptians as a material on which to plan the building of pyramids; they also used slabs of limestone and wood. From 600 to 250 BC, the Greeks played a major role in geometry. They used graphics to represent their mathematical theories such as the Circle Theorem and the Pythagorean theorem.

In art, &quot;graphics&quot; is often used to distinguish work in a monotone and made up of lines, as opposed to painting.

=== Drawing ===

Drawing generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool or moving a tool across a surface. In which a tool is always used as if there were no tools it would be art. Graphical drawing is an instrumental guided drawing.

=== Printmaking ===

Woodblock printing, including images is first seen in China after paper was invented (about A.D. 105). In the West, the main techniques have been woodcut, engraving and etching, but there are many others.

==== Etching ====

Etching is an intaglio method of printmaking in which the image is incised into the surface of a metal plate using an acid. The acid eats the metal, leaving behind roughened areas, or, if the surface exposed to the acid is very thin, burning a line into the plate. The use of the process in printmaking is believed to have been invented by Daniel Hopfer (–1536) of Augsburg, Germany, who decorated armour in this way.

Etching is also used in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards and semiconductor devices.

=== Line art ===

Line art is a rather non-specific term sometimes used for any image that consists of distinct straight and curved lines placed against a (usually plain) background, without gradations in shade (darkness) or hue (color) to represent two-dimensional or three-dimensional objects. Line art is usually monochromatic, although lines may be of different colors.

=== Illustration ===
An illustration is a visual representation such as a drawing, painting, photograph or other work of art that stresses the subject more than form. The aim of an illustration is to elucidate or decorate a story, poem or piece of textual information (such as a newspaper article), traditionally by providing a visual representation of something described in the text. The editorial cartoon, also known as a political cartoon, is an illustration containing a political or social message.

Illustrations can be used to display a wide range of subject matter and serve a variety of functions, such as:
* giving faces to characters in a story
* displaying a number of examples of an item described in an academic textbook (e.g. A Typology)
* visualizing step-wise sets of instructions in a technical manual
* communicating subtle thematic tone in a narrative
* linking brands to the ideas of human expression, individuality, and creativity
* making a reader laugh or smile
* for fun (to make laugh) funny

=== Graphs ===
A &quot;graph&quot; or &quot;chart&quot; is a graphic that represents tabular or numeric data. Charts are often used to make it easier to understand large quantities of data and the relationships between different parts of the data.

=== Diagrams ===

A diagram is a simplified and structured visual representation of concepts, ideas, constructions, relations, statistical data, etc., used to visualize and clarify the topic.

=== Symbols ===

A symbol, in its basic sense, is a representation of a concept or quantity; i.e., an idea, object, concept, quality, etc. In more psychological and philosophical terms, all concepts are symbolic in nature, and representations for these concepts are simply token artifacts that are allegorical to (but do not directly codify) a symbolic meaning, or symbolism.

=== Maps ===

A map is a simplified depiction of a space, a navigational aid which highlights relations between objects within that space. Usually, a map is a two-dimensional, geometrically accurate representation of a three-dimensional space.

One of the first &#x27;modern&#x27; maps was made by Waldseemüller.

=== Photography ===
One difference between photography and other forms of graphics is that a photographer, in principle, just records a single moment in reality, with seemingly no interpretation. However, a photographer can choose the field of view and angle, and may also use other techniques, such as various lenses to choose the view or filters to change the colors. In recent times, digital photography has opened the way to an infinite number of fast, but strong, manipulations. Even in the early days of photography, there was controversy over photographs of enacted scenes that were presented as &#x27;real life&#x27; (especially in war photography, where it can be very difficult to record the original events). Shifting the viewer&#x27;s eyes ever so slightly with simple pinpricks in the negative could have a dramatic effect.

The choice of the field of view can have a strong effect, effectively &#x27;censoring out&#x27; other parts of the scene, accomplished by cropping them out or simply not including them in the photograph. This even touches on the philosophical question of what reality is. The human brain processes information based on previous experience, making us see what we want to see or what we were taught to see. Photography does the same, although the photographer interprets the scene for their viewer.

=== Engineering drawings ===
An engineering drawing is a type of drawing and is technical in nature, used to fully and clearly define requirements for engineered items. It is usually created in accordance with standardized conventions for layout, nomenclature, interpretation, appearance (such as typefaces and line styles), size, etc.

=== Computer graphics ===

There are two types of computer graphics: raster graphics, where each pixel is separately defined (as in a digital photograph), and vector graphics, where mathematical formulas are used to draw lines and shapes, which are then interpreted at the viewer&#x27;s end to produce the graphic. Using vectors results in infinitely sharp graphics and often smaller files, but, when complex, like vectors take time to render and may have larger file sizes than a raster equivalent.
In 1950, the first computer-driven display was attached to MIT&#x27;s Whirlwind I computer to generate simple pictures. This was followed by MIT&#x27;s TX-0 and TX-2, interactive computing which increased interest in computer graphics during the late 1950s. In 1962, Ivan Sutherland invented Sketchpad, an innovative program that influenced alternative forms of interaction with computers.

In the mid-1960s, large computer graphics research projects were begun at MIT, General Motors, Bell Labs, and Lockheed Corporation. Douglas T. Ross of MIT developed an advanced compiler language for graphics programming. S.A.Coons, also at MIT, and J. C. Ferguson at Boeing, began work in sculptured surfaces. GM developed their DAC-1 system, and other companies, such as Douglas, Lockheed, and McDonnell, also made significant developments. In 1968, ray tracing was first described by Arthur Appel of the IBM Research Center, Yorktown Heights, N.Y.

During the late 1970s, home computers became more powerful, capable of drawing both basic and complex shapes and designs. In the 1980s, artists and graphic designers began to see the personal computer as a serious design tool, one that could save time and draw more accurately than other methods.

3D computer graphics began being used in video games in the 1970s with &quot;Spasim&quot; for the PLATO system in 1974 and &quot;FS1 Flight Simulator&quot; in 1979. Atari, Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Battlezone&quot; (1980) exposed 3D graphics to a wide audience. Other wireframe and flat-shaded 3D games appeared throughout the 1980s. &quot;Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss&quot; (1992) was one of the first major video games with texture-mapped polygons.

Computer systems dating from the 1980s and onwards often use a graphical user interface (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons, and pictures, rather than text. 3D computer graphics and creation tools became more accessible to video game and film developers in the late 1980s with SGI computers, which were later used to create some of the first fully computer-generated short films at Pixar.

3D graphics became more popular in the 1990s in video games, multimedia, and animation. In 1995, &quot;Toy Story&quot;, the first full-length computer-generated animation film, was released in cinemas. Since then, computer graphics have become more accurate and detailed, due to more advanced computers and better 3D modeling software applications, such as Maya, 3D Studio Max, and Cinema 4D. Consumer-level 3D graphics acceleration hardware became common in IBM PC compatibles near the end of the decade.
Another use of computer graphics is screensavers, originally intended to prevent the layout of much-used GUIs from &#x27;burning into&#x27; the computer screen. They have since evolved into true pieces of art, their practical purpose obsolete; modern screens are not susceptible to such artifacts.

=== Web graphics ===
In the 1990s, Internet speeds increased, and web browsers capable of viewing images were released, the first being Mosaic. Websites began to use the GIF format to display small graphics, such as banners, advertisements, and navigation buttons, on web pages. Modern web browsers can now display JPEG, PNG and increasingly, SVG images in addition to GIFs on web pages. SVG, and to some extent VML, support in some modern web browsers have made it possible to display vector graphics that are clear at any size. Plugins expand the web browser functions to display animated, interactive and 3-D graphics contained within file formats such as SWF and X3D.
Modern web graphics can be made with software such as Adobe Photoshop, the GIMP, or Corel Paint Shop Pro. Users of Microsoft Windows have MS Paint, which many find to be lacking in features. This is because MS Paint is a drawing package and a graphics package.

Numerous platforms and websites have been created to cater to web graphics artists and to host their communities. A growing number of people use create internet forum signatures—generally, appearing after a user&#x27;s post—and other digital artwork, such as photo manipulations and large graphics. With computer games&#x27; developers creating their own communities around their products, many more websites are being developed to offer graphics for the fans and to enable them to show their appreciation of such games in their own gaming profiles.

== Uses ==
Graphics are visual elements often used to point readers and viewers to particular information. They are also used to supplement text in an effort to aid readers in their understanding of a particular concept or make the concept more clear or interesting. Popular magazines, such as &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, usually contain graphic material in abundance to attract readers, unlike the majority of scholarly journals. In computing, they are used to create a graphical interface for the user; and graphics are one of the five key elements of multimedia technology. Graphics are among the primary ways of advertising the sale of goods or services.

=== Business ===
Graphics are commonly used in business and economics to create financial charts and tables. The term &quot;business graphics&quot; came into use in the late 1970s, when personal computers became capable of drawing graphs and charts instead of using a tabular format. Business graphics can be used to highlight changes over time.

=== Advertising ===
Advertising is one of the most profitable uses of graphics; artists often do advertising work or take advertising potential into account when creating art, to increase the chances of selling the artwork.
Most importantly, graphics give a good look to artwork whenever it is applied. Graphics contribute to the general outlook of a

=== Political ===
The use of graphics for overtly political purposes—cartoons, graffiti, poster art, flag design, etc.—is a centuries-old practice which thrives today in every part of the world. The Northern Irish murals are one such example. A more recent example is Shepard Fairey&#x27;s 2008 U.S. presidential election Barack Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster. It was first published on the web, but soon found its way onto streets throughout the United States.

=== Education ===
Graphics are heavily used in textbooks, especially those concerning subjects such as geography, science, and mathematics, in order to illustrate theories and concepts, such as the human anatomy. Diagrams are also used to label photographs and pictures.

Educational animation is an important emerging field of graphics. Animated graphics have obvious advantages over static graphics when explaining subject matter that changes over time.

The &quot;Oxford Illustrated Dictionary&quot; uses graphics and technical illustrations to make reading material more interesting and easier to understand. In an encyclopedia, graphics are used to illustrate concepts and show examples of the particular topic being discussed.

In order for a graphic to function effectively as an educational aid, the learner must be able to interpret it successfully. This interpretative capacity is one aspect of graphicacy.

=== Film and animation ===
Computer graphics are often used in the majority of new feature films, especially those with a large budget. Films that heavily use computer graphics include &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;.

== Graphics education ==
The majority of schools, colleges, and universities around the world educate students on the subject of graphic design and art.

The subject is taught in a broad variety of ways, each course teaching its own distinctive balance of craft skills and intellectual response to the client&#x27;s needs.

Some graphics courses prioritize traditional craft skills—drawing, printmaking, and typography—over modern craft skills. Other courses may place an emphasis on teaching digital craft skills. Still, other courses may downplay the crafts entirely, concentrating on training students to generate novel intellectual responses that engage with the brief. Despite these apparent differences in training and curriculum, the staff and students on any of these courses will generally consider themselves to be graphic designers.

The typical pedagogy of a graphic design (or graphic communication, visual communication, graphic arts or any number of synonymous course titles) will be broadly based on the teaching models developed in the Bauhaus school in Germany or Vkhutemas in Russia. The teaching model will tend to expose students to a variety of craft skills (currently everything from drawing to motion capture), combined with an effort to engage the student with the world of visual culture.

== Noted graphic designers ==
Aldus Manutius designed the first italic type style which is often used in desktop publishing and graphic design. April Greiman is known for her influential poster design. Paul Rand is well known as a design pioneer for designing many popular corporate logos, including the logo for IBM, NeXT and UPS. William Caslon, during the mid-18th century, designed many typefaces, including &quot;ITC Founder&#x27;s Caslon&quot;, &quot;ITC Founder&#x27;s Caslon Ornaments&quot;, &quot;Caslon Graphique&quot;, &quot;ITC Caslon No. 224&quot;, &quot;Caslon Old Face&quot; and &quot;Big Caslon&quot;.

<doc id="382484" wikidata="Q716896" url="?curid=382484" title="The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne">
<text>The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne is a Canadian science fiction television series that aired on CBC in Canada from June to December 2000, lasting for one season. The show is a fictionalized telling of the life of French author Jules Verne, placing him into the settings of the stories he wrote such as &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; and &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;. In the United States, the show aired on the Sci-Fi Channel, premiering in early 2001. &quot;The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne&quot; was the first television series to be filmed in high-definition video, which made the series expensive to produce.

==Plot==
The show features a fictionalized portrayal of French author Jules Verne (Chris Demetral), along with portrayals of the characters Jean Passepartout (Michel Courtemanche) and Phileas Fogg (Michael Praed), both originating from Verne&#x27;s 1873 work &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;. A new character is also created for the show: Phileas Fogg&#x27;s cousin Rebecca (Francesca Hunt). The show&#x27;s premise is of a young Verne being placed into scenarios similar to those of his stories prior to his having written them. Many of the show&#x27;s settings are portrayed via special effects and computer-generated imagery. Publicity for the show described its imagery as being steampunk.

==Production==
The pitch package for the show was developed by a USA based team that included a small VFX company called digital phenomena. As the team geared up, the Canadian government made the show producers an offer they couldn&#x27;t refuse. Canada would subsidize a majority of the CGI production costs. 

As a result the show was filmed in Montreal, Quebec at an estimated cost of $30,000,000 CAD. According to the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, it was the most expensive television series ever shot in the city. English screenwriter Gavin Scott, who created the series, worked with producer Michael Mullally and production company Talisman Films to create the show. Executive producer Pierre de Lespinois chose to film in Montreal due to the city&#x27;s architecture. &quot;The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne&quot; was the first television series to be recorded entirely in high-definition video; specifically, it used the HDCAM, a digital camera manufactured by Sony.

==Broadcast==
The show first aired on CBC in Canada in 2000. It was then broadcast in the United States on the Sci-Fi Channel, premiering in early 2001.

==Episodes==
==Critical reception==
An uncredited review in the &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; rated the show 2.5 out of 4 stars, stating that &quot;With its dark humor, odd machines of the Industrial Revolution, campy derring-do and attractive stars, &quot;The Secret Adventures of Jules Verne&quot; holds promise.&quot; Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was less favorable, describing the show&#x27;s premise as &quot;silly&quot; while also criticizing the directing, script, and characterization of Verne.

==Soundtrack==
The series&#x27; main theme and incidental music was composed by Nick Glennie-Smith. In April 2011, Perseverance Records released a 2-CD soundtrack of the series&#x27; music. The soundtrack included the main theme, closing theme, &quot;bumpers&quot; (played at commercial breaks), and suites from every episode of the series apart from &quot;The Book of Knowledge&quot;, for which the composer and the recording studio were unable to locate the original tapes.

<text>The Mozilla Foundation is an American non-profit organization that exists to support and collectively lead the open source Mozilla project. Founded in July 2003, the organization sets the policies that govern development, operates critical infrastructure, and controls Mozilla trademarks and copyrights. It owns two taxable subsidiaries: the Mozilla Corporation, which employs many Mozilla developers and coordinates releases of the Mozilla Firefox web browser, and MZLA Technologies Corporation, which employs developers to work on the Mozilla Thunderbird email client and coordinate its releases. The Mozilla Foundation was founded by the Netscape-affiliated Mozilla Organization. The organization is currently based in the Silicon Valley city of Mountain View, California, United States.

The Mozilla Foundation describes itself as &quot;a non-profit organization that promotes openness, innovation and participation on the Internet.&quot; The Mozilla Foundation is guided by the Mozilla Manifesto, which lists 10 principles which Mozilla believes &quot;are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life.&quot;

== History ==

On February 23, 1998, Netscape created the Mozilla Organization to co-ordinate the development of the Mozilla Application Suite. When AOL (Netscape&#x27;s parent) drastically scaled back its involvement with Mozilla Organization, the Mozilla Foundation was launched on July 15, 2003, to ensure Mozilla could survive without Netscape. AOL assisted in the initial creation of the Mozilla Foundation, transferring hardware and intellectual property to the organization, employed a three-person team for the first three months of its existence to help with the transition, and donated $2 million to the foundation over two years.

In September 2019, the Mozilla Foundation, Creative Commons, and Coil announced Grant for the Web, a $100 million fund designed to support the development of technologies, content, and ideas utilizing the Interledger Protocol. Management of this fund was transferred to the Interledger Foundation in 2021.

On November 4, 2024, The Mozilla Foundation announced via email they had laid off 30% of its employees as the organization says it faces a &quot;relentless onslaught of change.&quot;

== Subsidiaries ==

=== Mozilla Corporation ===
On August 3, 2005, the Mozilla Foundation announced the creation of Mozilla Corporation, described as &quot;a taxable subsidiary that serves the non-profit, public benefit goals of its parent, the Mozilla Foundation, and that will be responsible for product development, marketing and distribution of Mozilla products.&quot; It also handles relationships with businesses, many of which generate income. Unlike the Mozilla Foundation, the Mozilla Corporation is a tax-paying entity, giving it much greater freedom in its revenue and business activities. From 2004 to 2014, most revenue came from a deal with Google, the default search engine in the Firefox web browser. In November 2014, Mozilla signed a five-year partnership with Yahoo, making Yahoo! Search the default search engine for Firefox in the US. Yandex Search is the default for Firefox in Russia and Baidu continues its role as the default in China.

In November 2017, Mozilla terminated its agreement with Yahoo two years earlier than planned. While numerous factors were attributed to the decision to terminate the agreement, including some mention that Mozilla saw declining revenues related to the switch, likely the impetus was related to the recent acquisition of Yahoo by Verizon and Oath. Per Mozilla Chief Business and Legal Officer Denelle Dixon, &quot;We exercised our contractual right to terminate our agreement with Yahoo! based on a number of factors including doing what&#x27;s best for our brand, our effort to provide quality web search, and the broader content experience for our users. We believe there are opportunities to work with Oath and Verizon outside of search.&quot;

===Mozilla China===

Beijing Mozilla Online Ltd (), Mozilla China, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Corporation. Mozilla China is headquartered in Beijing.

===MZLA Technologies Corporation===
On January 28, 2020, the Mozilla Foundation announced that the Thunderbird project would henceforth be operating from a new wholly owned subsidiary, MZLA Technologies Corporation, in order to explore offering products and services that were not previously possible and to collect revenue through partnerships and non-charitable donations.

=== Mozilla Ventures ===
On November 2, 2022, Mozilla announced the establishment of Mozilla Ventures, an impact investing venture capital fund which &quot;supports early-stage startups whose products or technologies advance the values in the Mozilla Manifesto.&quot; It was established with an initial US$35 million, and followed over a decade of prior investments by Mozilla into startups.

== Financing ==

The Mozilla Foundation is funded by donations and 2% of annual net revenues from the Mozilla Corporation, amounting to over US$8.3 million in 2016.

Initial funding in 2003 came from AOL, which donated US$2 million, and from Mitch Kapor who donated US$300,000. The group has tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. tax code, though the Mozilla Corporation subsidiary is taxable.

In 2006, the Mozilla Foundation received US$66.8 million in revenues, of which US$61.5 million is attributed to &quot;search royalties&quot; from Google.

From 2004 to 2014, the foundation had a deal with Google to make Google Search the default in the Firefox browser search bar and hence send it search referrals; a Firefox-themed Google search site was also made the default home page of Firefox. The original contract expired in November 2006. However, Google renewed the contract until November 2008 and again through 2011. On December 20, 2011, Mozilla announced that the contract was once again renewed for at least three years to November 2014, at three times the amount previously paid, or nearly US$300 million annually. Approximately 90% of Mozilla&#x27;s royalties revenue for 2014 was derived from this contract.

In November 2014, Mozilla signed a five-year partnership (effective December 2014) with Yahoo!, making Yahoo! Search the default search engine for Firefox in North America. This partnership came with an annual price tag of US$375 million to be paid by Yahoo! or its acquirer in the event of an acquisition. There was also a clause stating that Mozilla reserved the right to terminate the deal early if it did not want to work with the acquirer, but the acquirer would still have to pay Mozilla the full sum per year until 2019. The default search engine in Russia will be Yandex, and in China, Baidu.

In November 2017, however, Mozilla announced that it was switching back to Google as the default search engine. This represented an early termination of its Yahoo partnership.

== People ==
Nabiha Syed was named the executive director of the Mozilla Foundation on May 15, 2024.

, the Mozilla Foundation board of directors has ten members:
* Mitchell Baker (Chair)
* Brian Behlendorf
* Amy Keating
* Nicole Wong
* Helen Turvey
* Mark Surman - also serves as the foundation&#x27;s president
* Alondra Nelson
* Edwin Macharia
* Raffi Krikorian
* Zain Habboo

==Donations==
In 2006, after a request from Theo de Raadt of OpenBSD for funding from corporate entities that make a profit through the use of OpenSSH in their packaged distributions, the Mozilla Foundation donated $10,000 to de Raadt and OpenBSD for OpenSSH development. The funds donated came from money earned through the income provided by Google. The Mozilla Foundation found that without OpenSSH, much of the work done by developers would be through insecure and unsafe methods, and gave the funds as a thank you.

At the end of 2010, the Mozilla Foundation partnered with Knoxville Zoo in an effort to raise awareness about endangered red pandas. Two red panda (a.k.a. Firefox) cubs born at the Knoxville Zoo have officially become a part of the Mozilla community. The cubs are named Spark and Ember by online voters, and Mozilla broadcasts a 24-hour live video stream of the cubs for several months.

<doc id="382494" wikidata="Q1084152" url="?curid=382494" title="Christian Zionism">
<text>Christian Zionism is a political and religious ideology that, in a Christian context, espouses the return of the Jewish people to the Holy Land. Likewise, it holds that the founding of the State of Israel in 1948 was in accordance with biblical prophecies transmitted through the Old Testament: that the re-establishment of Jewish sovereignty in the Levant—the eschatological &quot;Gathering of Israel&quot;—is a prerequisite for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The term began to be used in the mid-20th century, in place of Christian restorationism, as proponents of the ideology rallied behind Zionists in support of a Jewish national homeland.

An expectation of Jewish restoration among Christians is rooted in 17th-century English Puritan thought. Contemporary Israeli historian Anita Shapira suggests that England&#x27;s Zionist Evangelical Protestants &quot;passed this notion on to Jewish circles&quot; around the 1840s, while Jewish nationalism in the early 19th century was largely met with hostility from British Jews.

Christian pro-Zionist ideals emerged among the Puritans in the 16th and 17th centuries. While supporting a mass Jewish return to the Land of Israel, Christian Zionism asserts a parallel idea that the returnees ought to be encouraged to reject Judaism and adopt Christianity as a means of fulfilling biblical prophecies. Polling and academic research have suggested a trend of widespread distrust among Jews towards the motives of Evangelical Protestants, who have been promoting support for the State of Israel and evangelizing the Jews at the same time.

==History before the 20th century==
===Origins in Calvinistic millennialism===

The first wave of Protestant leaders, including Martin Luther and John Calvin, did not mention any special eschatological views which included a return of the Jews to Palestine (converted to Christianity or otherwise). More generally, Luther had hoped that the Jews would convert to his brand of Christianity once he had broken with the Catholic Church, but later he harshly denounced Jews. Like the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Lutheran Church and the Reformed Church saw the Christian Church as being the &quot;spiritual Israel&quot; and considered faithful Christians the exclusive &quot;people of God&quot;—those with whom God had entered into a covenant through Jesus Christ—assigning no special privileges or role to persons of Jewish descent. (In later times this has been called supersessionism.) 

The Protestant focus on &quot;sola scriptura&quot; and the wider distribution of the Bible across Europe in the vernacular languages, however, allowed various radical protestants to interpret the scriptures in their own ways, in a manner which was not entirely reflective of either medieval Catholic tradition, or, the views of the Magisterial Protestant leaders themselves. Coupled with this was a general cultural Hebraising among more radical Protestants, as they saw the veneration of saints as idolatry and placed more focus on the biblical patriarchs and prophets of the Old Testament, often naming their children Abraham, Cain, Jeremiah, Zachary, Daniel, Sampson, and the like. 
The anticipation of Jews returning to Palestine and making it their national homeland was first heard among self-identified Christian groups in the 1580s, particularly those aligned with Puritanism, a Reformed branch of Christianity that gave rise to the Congregationalist denomination. While Edward VI of England was the Tudor child-monarch of England, a Calvinist-leaning Regency &quot;de facto&quot; ruled. This allowed Continental Protestants such as Martin Bucer and Peter Martyr Vermigli to teach at the prestigious universities of Cambridge and Oxford. These two men forwarded a biblical exegesis which included an important role for the Jews, converted to Christianity, in the end times. Early versions of the Bible endorsed by the English monarchy and the Anglican Church included the &quot;Great Bible&quot; and the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;. However, a number of English Puritans and Lowland Scots Presbyterians viewed these (along with Episcopalianism and the establishment &quot;Protestantism of the princes&quot;), in general, as too &quot;Romanist.&quot; In response, a number of these Puritans and Presbyterians spent some time in Geneva in the 1560s under Calvin&#x27;s successor Theodore Beza and developed a translation of the Bible called the &quot;Geneva Bible&quot;, which contained footnotes in reference to the &quot;Book of Romans&quot;, specifically claiming that the Jews would be converted to Christianity in the end times and reorientating attention to Palestine as a central theatre. This view came to be taken up strongly by English Puritans (such as Francis Kett, Edmund Bunny, Thomas Draxe, Thomas Brightman, Joseph Mede, William Perkins, Richard Sibbes, Thomas Goodwin, William Strong, William Bridge, Henry Finch, John Owen and Giles Fletcher), Lowland Scots Presbyterians (such as George Gillespie, Robert Baillie and Samuel Rutherford), and even some Continental Protestants (such as Oliger Paulli, Isaac Vossius, Hugo Grotius, Gerhard Vossius and David Blondel).
During the late Tudor and early Stuart period, these Puritans remained outsiders in England and bitterly opposed the Laudian-dominated Anglican Church (though the Presbyterians, who held very similar views, had established the Church of Scotland as the largest &quot;Kirk&quot; in Scotland). With the English Civil War, the Puritans filled the ranks of the Parliamentarians and the New Model Army. Under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell they were victorious, executed Charles I of England and gained complete state power, establishing the Commonwealth of England between 1649 and 1660. The Philo-Semitic millennialist undercurrent came to have a direct influence on politics. A number of Cromwell&#x27;s close advisors, such as John Dury, John Sadler and Hugh Peter, came into contact with Dutch-based Jews such as Menasseh ben Israel and advocated Jewish resettlement in England (they had been banned from the country since the 13th century). Sadler, Cromwell&#x27;s secretary, even argued that the British were one of the Lost Tribes of Israel in his pamphlet &quot;The Rights of the Kingdom&quot; (1649) and thus kindred to the Jews, initiating British Israelism. Other Puritans such as Jeremiah Burroughs, Peter Bulkley, John Fenwicke and John Cotton, some of whom lived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, saw Jewish re-entry to England as a step on the path to their eventual return to Palestine (all tied up within a millennialist eschatology, which would hasten the Second Coming of Jesus Christ and thus the final judgement). Johanna and Ebenezer Cartwright, two Baptists who had spent time in Amsterdam, held the same view and issued the original petition to Thomas Fairfax&#x27;s Council of War in January 1649 for Jewish readmission: the petition hoped, &quot;That this Nation of England, with the inhabitants of the Netherlands, shall be the first and the readiest to transport Israel&#x27;s sons and daughters on their ships to the land promised to their forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob for an everlasting inheritance.&quot; Their &quot;de facto&quot; toleration in England was informally achieved by 1655 to 1656 and was not rolled back after the Restoration.

A prominent French-born figure Isaac La Peyrère, who was nominally a Huguenot Calvinist, but came from a Portuguese New Christian (converted Sephardic Jewish) family was also a significant 17th century progenitor, with influence on both sides of the English Channel. La Peyrère in his millennialist work &quot;Du rappel des juifs&quot; (1643) wrote about a Jewish return to Palestine, predicted the building of the Third Temple and Jerusalem playing the most powerful role in world governance: all working towards the Second Coming. La Peyrère closely followed the developments of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Dissenter regime and dreamed of overthrowing Louis XIV of France and replacing him with the Prince of Condé (who he worked for as a secretary) as part of a millennialist proto-Zionist messianic project. After the publication of La Peyrère&#x27;s book the Amsterdam-based Menasseh Ben Israel informed his friend, Petrus Serrarius (a close associate of John Dury), about the importance of the theories, showing an early interplay between 17th century Jewish and Protestant proto-Zionism. Other Continental Protestant millennialists enthused by La Peyrère&#x27;s theories were the Germans Abraham von Franckenberg (a student of the Kabbalah) and Paul Felgenhauer. Menasseh Ben Israel himself would author &quot;The Hope of Israel&quot; in 1652. Serrarius ended up being the main supporter among Protestants in Amsterdam of the message that Sabbatai Zevi was the Messiah, as proclaimed by Nathan of Gaza (his followers, the Sabbateans, were based in the Ottoman Empire but he had significant support throughout the Jewish diaspora).

Although removed from power in England itself, the millennialist Puritans who had moved to New England continued to have a deeper cultural legacy in society. As well as John Cotton, Increase Mather, one of the early Presidents of Harvard College was a strong proponent of the restoration of the Jews to Palestine. An author of numerous works, his most notable in this regard was &quot;The Mystery of Israel&#x27;s Salvation&quot; (1669). Roger Williams, the Puritan proponent of religious liberty (including for Jews) in the Colony of Rhode Island that he founded has been citied as a proto-Zionist in speeches by later Jewish Zionist leaders such as Stephen S. Wise, due to his comment that &quot;I have longed after some trading with the Jews themselves, for whose hard measure I fear the nations and England have yet a score to pay.&quot; Some important 17th-century philosophers who acted a bridge between the millennialist sectarians of their day and the approaching Age of the Enlightenment with its scientific revolution either held views associated with premillennial restorationists, or moved closely in their circles: this applies particularly to Sir Isaac Newton and Baruch Spinoza. Newton especially, who held Radical Reformation views in terms of religion and also dabbled in the occult (including the Kabbalah) predicted a Jewish return to Palestine, with the rebuilding of Jerusalem in the late 19th century and the erection of the Third Temple in the 20th or 21st century, leading to the end of the world no later than 2060. Much of these private writings were embarrassing to his supporters who sought to uphold him as a man of reason and science against Leibniz and while the University of Cambridge inherited his scientific papers, they refused to take these private ones. Many of these, collected by Abraham Yahuda, now rest in the National Library of Israel since 1967. Spinoza for his part, although Jewish himself, moved in circles in the Netherlands which included Petrus Serrarius, Henry Oldenburg and was even directly influenced by La Peyrère.

===Pietism, Evangelicalism, and British foreign policy===

With the rise of the Hanoverians to power in Britain and the ascent of the Enlightenment, much of the 18th century mainstream elite adopted Philhellenism, looking back to the culture and philosophies of the classical world for inspiration for the Georgian age, rather than entertaining millennialist fantasies based on the Hebrew Old Testament (though Jews themselves enjoyed significant toleration in the British Empire). Although marginal at first, a religious underground was slowly growing from the 1730s which would eventually spout a second wave of Protestant Zionism and with it the birth of Evangelical Protestantism. This was precipitated in Germany by Philipp Spener&#x27;s Pietism, a mystical and often millennialist take on Lutheranism, which prophesied the &quot;conversion of the Jews and the fall of the Papacy as the prelude of the triumph of the Church.&quot; One of Spener&#x27;s followers, Nicolaus Zinzendorf, spread this into the Moravian Church, linking the theory to Palestine, changing the Moravian liturgy to include a prayer &quot;to restore the tribe of Judah in its time and bless its first fruits among us.&quot; John and Charles Wesley, early leaders in Methodism; inspired by the Pietists and Zinzendorf&#x27;s Moravians; also promoted a Jewish return to Palestine with Charles Wesley even authoring a hymn dedicated to it. The Baptist, John Gill, who moved in similar circles to the Wesleys, authored works expressing similar views. By 1771, the Evangelical minister, John Eyre, founder of the &quot;Evangelical Magazine&quot; and among the original members of the &quot;London Missionary Society&quot; was promoting a more developed version of these views with his &quot;Observations upon Prophecies Relating to the Restoration of the Jews&quot;.
By the end of the 18th century, in the aftermath of the French Revolution and the National Assembly decreeing in December 1789 that non-Catholics were eligible for all civil and military positions, the Revolutionary government in France made a play for the allegiance of Jews, in competition with Britain. During the Egypt–Syria campaign of the French Revolutionary Wars, Bonaparte invited &quot;all the Jews of Asia and Africa to gather under his flag in order to re-establish the ancient Jerusalem.&quot; Although Bonaparte himself was secular and the idea an early example of pragmatic Political Zionism, the Jacobin idea itself may have originated from Thomas Corbet (1773–1804), an Anglo-Irish Protestant émigrée who, as a member of the liberal-republican Society of United Irishmen, was an ally of the Jacobin-government, engaged in revolutionary activities against the British and served in the French Army. In February 1790, he authored a letter to the French Directory, then under the leadership of Napoleon&#x27;s patron Paul Barras. In the letter he stated &quot;I recommend you, Napoleon, to call on the Jewish people to join your conquest in the East, to your mission to conquer the land of Israel&quot; saying, &quot;Their riches do not console them for their hardships. They await with impatience the epoch of their re-establishment as a nation.&quot; Dr. Milka Levy-Rubin, a curator at the National Library of Israel, has attributed Corbet&#x27;s motivation to a Protestant Zionism based on premillennialist themes.

In New England during the 18th century, Ezra Stiles, president of Yale College was a supporter of Jewish restoration and befriended Rabbi Raphael Chaim Yitzchak Karigal of Hebron in 1773 during his visit. Jonathan Edwards also anticipated a future return of Jews to their homeland. In 1808, Asa McFarland, a Presbyterian, voiced the opinion of many that the fall of the Ottoman Empire was imminent and would bring about Jewish restoration. One David Austin of New Haven spent his fortune building docks and inns from which the Jews could embark to the Holy Land. In 1825, Mordecai Manuel Noah, a Jew who wanted to found a national home for the Jews on Grand Island in New York as a way station on the way to the Holy Land, won widespread Christian backing for his project. Likewise, restorationist theology was among the inspirations for the first American missionary activity in the Middle East and for mapping the Holy Land.

Most early-19th-century British Restorationists, like Charles Simeon, were postmillennial in eschatology. With the rise of James Frere, James Haldane Stewart and Edward Irving a major shift in the 1820s towards premillennialism occurred, with a similar focus on advocacy for the restoration of the Jews to Israel. As the demise of the Ottoman Empire appeared to be approaching, the advocacy of restorationism increased. At the same time, the visit of John Nelson Darby to the United States catalyzed a new movement. Darby was the founder of a theological framework known as dispensationalism. This was expressed at the Niagara Bible Conference in 1878, which issued a 14-point proclamation (relying on Luke 12:35–40, 17:26–30, 18:8 Acts 15:14–17, 2 Thessalonians 2:3–8, 2 Timothy 3:1–5, and Titus 1:11–15), including:
The dispensationalist theology of John Nelson Darby is often claimed to be a significant awakener of American Christian Zionism. He first distinguished the hopes of the Jews and that of the church and gentiles in a series of 11 evening lectures in Geneva in 1840. His lectures were immediately published in French (&quot;L&#x27;Attente Actuelle de l&#x27;Eglise&quot;), English (1841), German and Dutch (1847) and so his teachings began their global journey. Some dispensationalists, like Arno Gabelein, whilst philo-semitic, opposed Zionism as a movement born in self-confidence and unbelief. While dispensationalism had considerable influence through the Scofield Reference Bible, Christian lobbying for the restoration of the Jews preceded the publication of the Scofield Reference Bible (first published by OUP, 1909) by over a century, and many Christian Zionists and Christian Zionist organizations such as the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem do not subscribe to dispensationalism. Many non-dispensationalist Protestants were also strong advocates of a Jewish return to their homeland, Charles Spurgeon, both Horatius and Andrew Bonar, Robert Murray M&#x27;Chyene, and J. C. Ryle were among a number of proponents of both the importance and significance of a Jewish return to Israel. However Spurgeon averred of dispensationalism: &quot;It is a mercy that these absurdities are revealed one at a time, in order that we may be able to endure their stupidity without dying of amazement&quot;. In 1864, Spurgeon wrote:
The crumbling of the Ottoman Empire threatened the British route to India via the Suez Canal as well as sundry French, German and American economic interests. In 1831 the Ottomans were driven from the region of Syria (including Palestine) by an expansionist Egypt, in the First Turko-Egyptian War. Although Britain forced Muhammad Ali to withdraw to Egypt, the Levant was left for a brief time without a government. The ongoing weakness of the Ottoman Empire made some in the west consider the potential of a Jewish state in the Holy Land. A number of important figures within the British government advocated such a plan, including Charles Henry Churchill. Again during the lead-up to the Crimean War (1854), there was an opportunity for political rearrangements in the Near East. In July 1853, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, who was President of the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews, wrote to Prime Minister Aberdeen urging Jewish restoration as a means of stabilizing the region.

Late-19th-century non-messianic restorationism was largely driven by concern over the fate of the Jews of the Russian Empire, beset by poverty and by deadly, government-inspired pogroms. It was widely accepted that western nations did not wish to receive Jewish immigrants. Restorationism was a way for charitable individuals to assist oppressed Jews without actually accepting them as neighbors and fellow-citizens. In this, Restorationism was not unlike the efforts of the American Colonization Society to send blacks to Liberia and the efforts of British abolitionists to create Sierra Leone. Winston Churchill endorsed Restoration because he recognized that Jews fleeing Russian pogroms required a refuge, and preferred Palestine for sentimental reasons.

===In the United States===
In 1818, President John Adams wrote, &quot;I really wish the Jews again in Judea an independent nation&quot;, and believed that they would gradually become Unitarian Christians.

In 1844, George Bush, a professor of Hebrew at New York University and the cousin of an ancestor of the Presidents Bush, published a book titled &quot;The Valley of Vision; or, The Dry Bones of Israel Revived&quot;. In it he denounced &quot;the thralldom and oppression which has so long ground them (the Jews) to the dust,&quot; and called for &quot;elevating&quot; the Jews &quot;to a rank of honorable repute among the nations of the earth&quot; by allowing restoring the Jews to the land of Israel where the bulk would be converted to Christianity. This, according to Bush, would benefit not only the Jews, but all of mankind, forming a &quot;link of communication&quot; between humanity and God. &quot;It will blaze in notoriety ...&quot;. &quot;It will flash a splendid demonstration upon all kindreds and tongues of the truth.&quot;

Herman Melville expressed the idea in a poem, &quot;Clarel; A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land&quot;:
The tycoon William Eugene Blackstone was inspired by the conference to publish the book &quot;Jesus is Coming&quot;, which took up the restorationist cause. His book was translated and published in Yiddish. On November 24–25, 1890, Blackstone organized the Conference on the Past, Present and Future of Israel at the First Methodist Episcopal Church in Chicago where participants included leaders of many Christian communities. Resolutions of sympathy for the oppressed Jews living in Russia were passed, but Blackstone was convinced that such resolutions—even though passed by prominent men—were insufficient. He advocated strongly for the resettlement of Jewish people in Palestine. In 1891 he lobbied President Benjamin Harrison for the restoration of the Jews, in a petition signed by 413 prominent Americans, that became known as the Blackstone Memorial. The names included the US Chief Justice, Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee, and several other congressmen, Rockefeller, Morgan and famous industrialists. It read, in part: &quot;Why shall not the powers which under the treaty of Berlin, in 1878, gave Bulgaria to the Bulgarians and Servia to the Servians now give Palestine back to the Jews? ... These provinces, as well as Romania, Montenegro, and Greece, were wrested from the Turks and given to their natural owners. Does not Palestine as rightfully belong to the Jews?&quot;

===In Great Britain===
Ideas favoring the restoration of the Jews in Palestine or the Land of Israel entered the British public discourse in the 1830s, though British Reformationists had written about the restoration of the Jews as early as the 16th century, and the idea had strong support among Puritans. Not all such attitudes were favorable towards the Jews; they were shaped in part by a variety of Protestant beliefs,
or by a streak of philo-Semitism among the classically educated British elite.

At the urging of Lord Shaftesbury, Britain established a consulate in Jerusalem in 1838, the first diplomatic appointment to Palestine.

In 1839, the Church of Scotland sent Andrew Bonar, Robert Murray M&#x27;Cheyne, Alexander Black and Alexander Keith on a mission to report on the condition of the Jews in Palestine. Their report was widely published. They traveled through France, Greece, and Egypt, and from Egypt, overland to Gaza. On the way home they visited Syria, the Austrian Empire and some of the German states. They sought out Jewish communities and inquired about their readiness to accept Christ, and separately, their preparedness to return to Israel as prophesied in the Bible. Alexander Keith recounted the journey in his 1844 book &quot;The Land of Israel According to the Covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob&quot;. It was also in that book that Keith used the slogan that became popular with other Christian Restorationists, a land without a people for a people without a land. In 1844 he revisited Palestine with his son, George Skene Keith (1819–1910), who was the first person to photograph the land.

An important, though often neglected, figure in British support of the restoration of the Jews was William Hechler (1845–1931), an English clergyman of German descent who was Chaplain of the British Embassy in Vienna and became a close friend of Theodor Herzl. Hechler was instrumental in aiding Herzl through his diplomatic activities, and may, in that sense, be called the founder of modern Christian Zionism. When it came to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of Herzl&#x27;s death, it was noted by the editors of the English-language memorial volume that William Hechler would prove &quot;not only the first, but the most constant and the most indefatigable of Herzl&#x27;s followers&quot;.
====Balfour Declaration====
On 2 November 1917, UK Home Secretary Arthur Balfour sent a letter to Lord Walter Rothschild. This letter, known as the Balfour Declaration, famously stated that &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.&quot; As noted by Philip Alexander, &quot;A crucial ingredient in Balfour&#x27;s Zionism [may have been] his Christian belief or, to put it a little more subtly, his Christian formation. The most persuasive advocate of this thesis is the Canadian historian Donald Lewis in his 2010 monograph, &quot;The Origins of Christian Zionism&quot;, but it has been espoused by a number of other scholars as well.&quot;

==Between World War I and the 1948 Palestine War==
=== In the United States ===
In the decades leading up to the establishment of Israel in 1948, the most prominent and politically active American Christian supporters of Zionism were liberal and mainline Protestants whose support for the movement was often unrelated to their interpretation of the Bible. These Christian supporters of Zionism viewed Palestine as a needed safe haven for Jews who were fleeing from intensifying persecution in Europe and they frequently believed that their support of the movement was part of a broader effort at interfaith rapprochement. The Pro-Palestine Federation, a Christian pro-Zionist organization which was founded in 1930, called for the promotion of &quot;goodwill and esteem between Jews and non-Jews&quot; and it also called for the British government to adhere to the terms of its Mandate for Palestine, which pledged support for the establishment of a Jewish national home.

Amidst World War II and their growing awareness of the Holocaust, American Jewish Zionists helped coordinate the establishment of two non-Jewish Zionist organizations, the American Palestine Committee and the Christian Council on Palestine, which were later merged into the American Christian Palestine Committee (ACPC). The ACPC, which was composed largely of liberal and mainline Protestants, became the leading American Christian lobby in support of the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. After the establishment of Israel in 1948, the ACPC continued its lobbying efforts. For instance, it coordinated opposition to the United Nations&#x27; efforts to internationalize the city of Jerusalem, which was divided between Israel and Transjordan in the 1948 War.

During these years, dispensational premillennialism grew in popularity among conservative American Protestants. Many dispensationalists viewed the Zionist movement as at least a partial fulfillment of biblical prophecy or they viewed it as a modern fulfillment of God&#x27;s covenantal promises to the Jewish people. In the 1930s, Southern Baptist missionary Jacob Gartenhaus, himself a convert from Judaism, argued that &quot;Zionism is going to win whether anybody likes it or not...To oppose it is to oppose God&#x27;s plan.&quot; But for the most part, such beliefs did not translate into political action on behalf of the movement in this era. One slight exception was J. Frank Norris, a fundamentalist Baptist who split time between pulpits in Fort Worth, Texas, and Detroit, Michigan. While Norris did not organize lobbying efforts in the way that the ACPC did, he did preach to his followers that it was their Christian duty to support the Zionist cause and wrote President Truman in support of Zionist claims to Palestine in 1947 and 1948. Norris also loosely coordinated with the ACPC, at times publishing their materials in his periodical, &quot;The Fundamentalist&quot;.

== After the founding of the State of Israel ==
=== In the United States ===

In the decades since the establishment of Israel, and especially since the 1967 Six-Day War, the most prominent American Christian supporters of Israel have come from the evangelical wing of American Protestantism. American evangelicalism itself underwent significant changes in the years surrounding Israel&#x27;s birth, as a &quot;new&quot; evangelicalism led by figures like Billy Graham emerged from Protestantism and came to cultural prominence. It was among these new evangelicals that the contemporary movement that most commonly associated with the term &quot;Christian Zionism&quot; originated.

Many new evangelicals adhered to dispensationalism or at least, they adhered to beliefs which were inspired by it—most especially, they adhered to the dispensationalist understanding that Jews remained in a special covenantal relationship with God. Most important to the development of Christian Zionism as a movement, though, was the fact that American evangelical leaders began to build relationships with American and Israeli Jews and they also began to build institutional connections with Jewish organizations and the Israeli government itself. Crucial to the building of these relationships was a motivated coterie of American evangelicals who resided in Israel, most notably, the founder of the American Institute of Holy Land Studies, G. Douglas Young. Through his institute, Young worked to convince American Christians that it was their biblical duty to support the Jewish people and the Jewish state. He also worked as a go-between for Jewish organizations and Israeli government agencies which were seeking to build relationships with American evangelicals. Such activism provided the basis for the development of Christian Zionism as a movement.

Such activism, it should be noted, was in many ways distinct from the prophetic speculation about the State of Israel that exploded after the 1967 Six-Day War (even as it had somewhat common theological and hermeneutical antecedents). This activism includes the wildly popular writings of the American dispensationalist evangelical writer Hal Lindsey, which sought to fit Israel into a dispensationalist end-time narrative. In &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;, for example, Lindsey anticipated that, per , Jews would fight off a &quot;Russian&quot; invasion before realizing their miraculous deliverance and converting to Christianity. Their lives would be spared the great fire that God will put upon Russia and people of the &quot;coastlands.&quot; And, per , one third of Jews alive who have converted will be spared. Lindsay has been critiqued for highly specific, failed predictions even by those who share his eschatology, like John MacArthur.

Examples of Protestant leaders who combined political conservatism with Christian Zionism are Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, leading figures on the Christian Right in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1981, Falwell said: &quot;To stand against Israel is to stand against God. We believe that history and scripture prove that God deals with nations in relation to how they deal with Israel.&quot; They cite part of the blessing of Isaac at , &quot;Those who curse you will be cursed, and those who bless you will be blessed.&quot; Martin Luther King Jr. has also been cited as a Christian supporter of Israel and Zionism.

=== In Israel ===
The government of Israel has given official encouragement to Christian Zionism, allowing the establishment of the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem in 1980. The embassy has raised funds to help finance Jewish immigration to Israel from the former Soviet Union, and has assisted Zionist groups in establishing Jewish settlements in the West Bank.

The Third International Christian Zionist Congress, held in Jerusalem in February 1996, issued a proclamation which said:
Popular interest in Christian Zionism was given a boost around the year 2000 in the form of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series of novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. The novels are built around the prophetic role of Israel in the apocalyptic end times.

==Critical views within Christianity==
===General===
For most Christians the City of God () has nothing to do with Jewish immigration to Israel and the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict; instead, it predicts the sack of Rome (410) and it is cited in the teaching of Saint Augustine of Hippo. That is why neither Eastern Orthodox Christians nor traditional Catholic Christians did consider Zionism in any political form: &quot;[The Eastern Orthodox Church [...] upheld a historic lack of emphasis on pilgrimage, insisting that the land of promise was not Palestine but the Kingdom of God. Thus, Patriarch Ignatius IV, head of the church in the Middle East, reiterated that the people were his concern in Jerusalem, not the stones.&quot; Not a worldly kingdom, not an earthly Jerusalem is sought after, but the focus is on the heavenly Jerusalem, the kingdom of the triune God:
===Catholic Church===

The Catholic Church—the largest branch of Christians in the world—does not endorse the theological premises underlying millennialist Restorationism as propounded by dispensationalists and it has generally inveighed against the prospect of Jewish governance over Holy Places in Palestine which it deems of importance to Christianity. Theodor Herzl, the secular Jewish founder of modern political Zionism, had an audience in the Vatican with Pope Pius X in 1904, arranged by the Austrian Count Berthold Dominik Lippay, seeking out the position of the Catholic Church on Herzl&#x27;s prospective project for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. Pope Pius X stated &quot;We cannot prevent the Jews from going to Jerusalem—but we could never sanction it. The soil of Jerusalem, if it was not always sacred, has been sanctified by the life of Jesus Christ. As the head of the Church I cannot tell you anything different. The Jews have not recognized our Lord, therefore we cannot recognize the Jewish people.&quot; After Herzl explained that his reasoning behind the project for the creation of a Jewish state was not a religious statement, but interest in secular land for national independence, Pope Pius X replied &quot;Does it have to be &quot;Gerusalemme&quot;?&quot;

While it rejected a theological basis for Zionism outright, a major concern for the Holy See was the fate of the Holy Places which were associated with Jesus Christ if they should ever fall under the governance of such a state. By the mid-19th century, relations between the Vatican and Istanbul were fairly collegial; by that time, the Muslim Ottomans permitted the Vatican to work among the Arab Catholics in Palestine and they also permitted the Vatican to access the Holy Places quite freely so the &quot;status quo&quot; was already workable for them. Following the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the Vatican advocated the position that Jerusalem should be treated as a separate &quot;international city&quot;, as laid out in the encyclical &quot;Redemptoris nostri cruciatus&quot;. Until the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church was forthright in its international lobbying against Zionism (including the Catholic Church in the United States, because the United States had become Zionism&#x27;s most powerful endorser). The State of Israel and the Holy See only established full diplomatic relations in 1993 and this was a recognition of political and civic reality, not a theological statement. In the 20th and 21st centuries, certain Catholic theologians such as André Villeneuve, Gary Anderson and Gavin D&#x27;Costa, have written in support of Christian Zionism, holding it to be a sign of God&#x27;s fidelity.

===Protestantism===
Political Zionism, which &quot;came down like the wolf on the fold&quot;, has also been anathematized by eminent Protestants:

The La Grange Declarations of 1979 and 1981 were issued by a broad array of (mostly Protestant) Christian leaders critical of Christian Zionism who advocated for a change in church and governmental positions on Israel and Palestine. The 1979 statement, drafted at a conference in LaGrange, Illinois, criticized Israel’s territorial actions, recognized the right of Palestinians to self-determination, and called for the U.S. to end its unconditional backing of Israel, though it stopped short of denying Israel&#x27;s legitimacy. The 1981 declaration took a more assertive stance, challenging the religious justification for Israel’s claims to the land, demanding a full cessation of U.S. military aid to Israel, and denouncing American policies that restricted the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Both declarations represented a growing Christian movement that sought to oppose pro-Israel evangelical perspectives and bring attention to Palestinian political and humanitarian concerns.

In the United States, the General Assembly of the National Council of Churches in November 2007 approved a resolution for further study which stated that the &quot;theological stance of Christian Zionism adversely affects:
* justice and peace in the Middle East, delaying the day when Israelis and Palestinians can live within secure borders
* relationships with Middle Eastern Christians (see the Jerusalem Declaration on Christian Zionism)
* relationships with Jews, since Jews are seen as mere pawns in an eschatological scheme
* relationships with Muslims, since it treats the rights of Muslims as subordinate to the rights of Jews
* interfaith dialogue, since it views the world in starkly dichotomous terms&quot;

The Reformed Church in America at its 2004 General Synod found &quot;the ideology of Christian Zionism and the extreme form of dispensationalism that undergirds it to be a distortion of the biblical message noting the impediment it represents to achieving a just peace in Israel/Palestine.&quot; The Mennonite Central Committee has criticized Christian Zionism, noting that in some churches under its influence the &quot;congregations &#x27;adopt&#x27; illegal Israeli settlements, sending funds to bolster the defense of these armed colonies.&quot; As of September 2007, churches in the US that have criticized Christian Zionism include the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church (USA), and the United Church of Christ.

The film &quot;With God On Our Side&quot;, by Porter Speakman Jr. and Kevin Miller (the latter of whom also co-created the film &quot;&quot;), criticizes both the underlying theology behind Christian Zionism as well as its negative influence on the church.

In the United Kingdom, the Church of Scotland, despite its Restorationist history, has recently been critical of Zionism in general, and in turn has received strong criticism over the perceived injustice of its report, &quot;The Inheritance of Abraham: A Report on the Promised Land&quot;, which resulted in its republication in a briefer form. On 9 July 2012, the Anglican General Synod passed a motion affirming support for the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI). This was criticised by the Board of Deputies claiming the Synod &#x27;has chosen to promote an inflammatory and partisan programme&#x27;. The advocated group was simultaneously criticised for its publication of a call for sit-ins at Israeli Embassies, the hacking of government websites to promote its message, and support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel.

==Biblical interpretations==
Some Christian Zionists interpret the prophetic texts as describing inevitable future events, and these events primarily involve Israel (taken to mean the descendants of the Biblical patriarch Jacob) or Judah (taken to mean the remaining faithful adherents of Judaism). These prophecies are seen as requiring the presence of a Jewish state in the Holy Land, the central part of the lands promised to the Biblical patriarch Abraham in the Covenant of the pieces. This requirement is sometimes interpreted as being fulfilled by the contemporary state of Israel.

===Other doctrines===
Christian schools of doctrine which consider other teachings to counterbalance these doctrines, or which interpret them in terms of distinct eschatological theories, are less conducive to Christian Zionism. Among the many texts which address this subject in counterbalance are the words of Jesus, as for example in Matthew , &quot;the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing the fruits of it&quot;.

In &quot;Defending Christian Zionism&quot;, David Pawson, a Christian Zionist in the United Kingdom, puts forward the case that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land is a fulfilment of scriptural prophecy, and that Christians should support the existence of the Jewish State (although not unconditionally its actions) on theological grounds. He also argues that prophecies spoken about Israel relate specifically to Israel (not to the church, as in &quot;replacement theology&quot;). However, he criticises Dispensationalism, which he says is a largely American movement holding similar views. Pawson was spurred to write this book by the work of Stephen Sizer, an evangelical Christian who rejects Christian Zionism.

==Demographics==
Tens of millions of Americans belong to Evangelical churches that strongly support Israel for religious reasons, and there are tens of millions more Christians who identify as Christian Zionists outside the United States.

The largest Zionist organisation is Christians United for Israel, which has 10 million members and is led by John Hagee.

==Public opinion==
A 2017 LifeWay poll conducted in United States found that 80% of evangelical Christians believed that the creation of Israel in 1948 was a fulfillment of biblical prophecy that would bring about Christ&#x27;s return and more than 50% of Evangelical Christians believed that they support Israel because it is important for fulfilling the prophecy.

According to the Pew Research survey in 2003, more than 60% of the Evangelical Christians and about 50% of Blacks agreed that the existence of Israel fulfilled biblical prophecy. About 55% of poll respondents said that the Bible was the biggest influence for supporting Israel which is 11 times the people who said church was the biggest influence.

<text>was a Japanese general in the Imperial Japanese Army and cabinet minister before World War II, the 5th principal of Takushoku University, and twice Governor-General of Korea. Nicknamed Ugaki Issei, he served as Foreign Minister of Japan in the Konoe cabinet in 1938.

==Biography==
===Military career===
Ugaki was the fifth son of an impoverished farming family in Ochi village, Bizen Province (currently the town of Seto, Okayama). He excelled in all studies, and passed a teacher recruitment examination. He worked as an elementary school teacher in his teens, moved to Tokyo, and managed to secure a position at the first class of the reformed Imperial Japanese Army Academy. He graduated in 1891 ranked 11th out of a class of 150. In 1900, he graduated from the Army Staff College, ranked 3rd out of a class of 39 and was awarded a sword of merit. He became a protege of General Kawakami Soroku as a captain and was sent as military attaché to Germany from 1902 to 1904, and again from 1906 to 1907. Ugaki also was a protege of general Tanaka Giichi, under whom he was promoted to colonel in 1910 and major general in 1915. He was chief of the 1st Bureau of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in 1916 and was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1919. He served as commandant of the Army Staff College from 1919 to 1921 and became commander of the Himeji-based IJA 10th Division from March 1921 to May 1922. From October 1923, he served as Vice Minister of the Army.

===Army Minister and Governor-General of Korea===
In January 1924, Ugaki was appointed Army Minister by Prime Minister Keigo Kiyoura. He continued in this post in the Katō Takaaki and the first Reijirō Wakatsuki cabinets until April 1927. The political machinations of the Rikken Seiyukai political party and his mentor, Tanaka Giichi, were behind his appointment. 

Ugaki strove to protect the superior position of the Imperial Japanese Army in Japanese politics, fearing a loss of influence to the Imperial Japanese Navy, should the United States be judged &quot;Hypothetical National Enemy No. 1&quot;. Ugaki&#x27;s plans called for an Army of 50 divisions. Nevertheless, despite Ugaki&#x27;s strenuous opposition, the Katō Takaaki cabinet continued with its fiscal retrenchment policy (from May 1925) and Ugaki was forced to eliminate four infantry divisions (the IJA 13th Division, IJA 15th Division, IJA 17th Division, and IJA 18th Division), which resulted in the release of approximately 2,000 commissioned officers. He was also forced to shorten the period of time conscripts served with the remaining divisions and to force many senior officers into early retirement. The fact that the monies saved by these policies were used to implement much-needed modernization of military equipment and training had little impact on Ugaki&#x27;s extremely unpopularity within the Army, and in 1927 Ugaki accepted a posting as Governor-General of Korea from April 1927 rather than continue as Army Minister.

Ugaki&#x27;s first term as Governor-General of Korea was only until December 1927.

In 1929, Ugaki was promoted to full general. Under Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi, he agreed to return as Army Minister in July 1929. However, the failure of Hamaguchi&#x27;s economic policies after the start of the Great Depression and his push for demilitarization with the London Naval Treaty of 1930 enraged right-wing ultranationists. In 1931, although Ugaki refused to cooperate with them, he also failed to punish the insurgents responsible for the March Incident, an attempted coup-d&#x27;etat by young officers of the &quot;Sakurakai&quot; who sought to make him Prime Minister. Having lost the support of his fellow officers, Ugaki resigned from the military in April 1931 and once again accepted a posting as Governor-General of Korea.

During his second period in Korea, from June 1931 to August 1936, Ugaki made concentrated efforts to build up the industrial base in the Korean peninsula, especially in the areas of heavy industry and munitions, which he felt would be invaluable in an upcoming war with China, which he considered unavoidable in the near future. He also promoted a policy of reconciliation which was in stark contrast to the more repressive regimes before and after his administration.

===Almost Prime Minister===
Recalled to Japan after the fall of the Hirota Kōki administration, Ugaki was named Prime Minister in February 1937, but was unable to form a Cabinet due to strong opposition from his political enemies within the Army. Ugaki was highly regarded by Saionji Kinmochi and was perceived as having a moderate foreign policy and being opposed to the increasingly fascistic trends within the military. The situation in Japan had become highly unstable, with increasing international isolation following the withdrawal from the League of Nations, lack of economic recovery and increasing distrust of politicians due to constant corruption scandals, and terrorist attacks by elements of the Army itself. After the February 26 Incident in 1936, the Japanese military had obtained a restoration of the requirement that the Army and Navy Ministers must be selected only from active duty officers. Ugaki, although Prime Minister-designate (and a retired full general in his own right) remained a persona non grata with the Army leadership over his previous terms as Army Minister and over the March Incident, along with his alleged ties to the &quot;zaibatsu&quot; businesses over the Korean industrialization program, so they refused to provide him with an Army Minister. As a consequence, although officially appointed, Ugaki could never assume office. The post of prime minister then went to Senjūrō Hayashi, another ex-general and member of the &quot;Tōseiha&quot; faction.

The Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s ability to control the formation of a government by means of withholding nomination of a cabinet minister was a staggering blow to the evolution of parliamentary government and democracy in Japan and unquestionably, the decisive factor in the military supremacy over civilian authority before and during World War II.

===Subsequent career===
In May 1938, Ugaki accepted the post of Foreign Minister under the first Konoe administration, simultaneously holding the portfolio of Minister of Colonial Affairs, but resigned after only four months. Ugaki had been requested by Konoe for assistance to negotiate a peace settlement with the Republic of China following the Marco Polo Bridge incident to avoid an all-out war. Ugaki enlisted the aid of British and American ambassadors to open a direct negotiation with Chinese premier H. H. Kung; however, his efforts were quickly undercut by the Japanese Army, who applied pressure onto Konoe that the military and not a civilian military should be responsible for all negotiations. Konoe wavered between positions and finally sided with the military, and Ugaki resigned in protest.

In 1944, Ugaki left politics and accepted the post of president of Takushoku University, which he held throughout the remainder of the war years. He was the center of a movement which supported a quick end to World War II, and from 1943 was active in efforts to oust Prime Minister Hideki Tojo from office.

After World War II, along with all former members of the Japanese government, Ugaki was purged from public service and arrested by the American Occupation authorities. However, he was never charged with any war crimes, and was soon released.

In 1953, Ugaki ran for public office on a national ticket and was elected to the House of Councillors in the post-war Diet of Japan with an overwhelming vote. Ugaki died in 1956 at his summer villa in Izunokuni, Shizuoka.

<doc id="382501" wikidata="Q455162" url="?curid=382501" title="Vincent of Beauvais">
<text>Vincent of Beauvais ( or ; ; c. 1264) was a Dominican friar at the Cistercian monastery of Royaumont Abbey, France. He is known mostly for his &quot;Speculum Maius&quot; (&quot;Great mirror&quot;), a major work of compilation that was widely read in the Middle Ages. Often retroactively described as an encyclopedia or as a &quot;florilegium&quot;, his text exists as a core example of brief compendiums produced in medieval Europe.

==Biography==
The exact dates of his birth and death are unknown, and not much detail has surfaced concerning his career. Conjectures place him first in the house of the Dominicans at Paris between 1215 and 1220, and later at the Dominican monastery founded by Louis IX of France at Beauvais in Picardy. It is more certain, however, that he held the post of &quot;reader&quot; at the monastery of Royaumont on the Oise, not far from Paris, also founded by Louis IX, between 1228 and 1235. Around the late 1230s, Vincent had begun working on the &quot;Great Mirror&quot; and in 1244 he had completed the first draft. The king read the books that Vincent compiled and supplied the funds for procuring copies of such authors as he required. Queen Margaret of Provence and her son-in-law, Theobald V of Champagne and Navarre, are also named among those who urged him to the composition of his &quot;little works&quot;, especially &quot;De morali principis institutione&quot;. In the late 1240s, Vincent was working on his &quot;Opus&quot; which included &quot;On the Education of Noble Girls&quot; (&quot;De Eruditione Filiorum Nobilium&quot;). In this work he styles himself as &quot;Vincentius Belvacensis, de ordine praedicatorum, qualiscumque lector in monasterio de Regali Monte&quot;. Though Vincent may have been summoned to Royaumont before 1240, there is no evidence that he lived there before the return of Louis IX and his wife from the Holy Land. It is possible that he left Royaumont in 1260, which is also the approximate year that he wrote &quot;Tractatus Consolatorius&quot;, which was occasioned by the death of the king&#x27;s son Louis that year. Between the years 1260 and 1264 Vincent sent the first completed book of the &quot;Opus&quot; to Louis IX and Thibaut V. In 1264 he died.

==&quot;Great Mirror&quot; (&quot;Speculum Maius&quot;)==

What is known of Vincent and his historical importance largely depends on his compendium &quot;Speculum Maius&quot; or the &quot;Great Mirror&quot;. He worked on it for approximately 29 years (1235–1264) in the pursuit of presenting a compendium of all of the knowledge available at the time. He collected the materials for the work from Île-de-France libraries, and there is evidence to suggest even further than that. He found support for the creation of the &quot;Great Mirror&quot; from the Dominican order to which he belonged as well as King Louis IX of France. The metaphor of the title has been argued to &quot;reflect&quot; the microcosmic relations of Medieval knowledge. In this case, the book mirrors &quot;both the contents and organization of the cosmos&quot;. Vincent himself stated that he chose &quot;Speculum&quot; for its name because his work contains &quot;whatever is worthy of contemplation (&quot;speculatio&quot;), that is, admiration or imitation&quot;. It is by this name that the compendium is connected to the medieval genre of speculum literature.

==Other works==

* &quot;Universal Work on the Royal Condition&quot; (&quot;Opus universale de statu principis&quot;) was described as a guideline to &quot;provide instructions for the behaviors and duties of the prince, his family, and his court&quot;. It was to be a four-part treatise, although only the first, &quot;The moral instruction of a prince&quot;, and the fourth, &quot;The education of noble children&quot;, were completed.
:* &quot;The Moral Instruction of a Prince&quot; or &quot;On the Foundations of Royal Morals&quot; (&quot;De morali Principis institutione&quot;) (1260–1263), written for King Louis IX of France on the topic of kingship. 
:* &quot;The Education of Noble Children&quot; (&quot;De eruditione filiorum nobilium&quot;) (1249). This pedagogical treatise has also been viewed as a sermon expanding on the biblical passage Ecclesiasticus 7:25-26: &quot;You have sons? Train them and care for them from boyhood. You have daughters? Guard their bodies and do not show a joyful face to them.&quot; The majority of the text deals with the education of boys, with roughly one-fifth of the text devoted to the education of girls. The text is notable for being &quot;the first medieval educational text to both systematically present a comprehensive method of instruction for lay children and to included a section devoted to girls.&quot;

* &quot;Expositio in orationem dominicam&quot; (&quot;Exposition on the Lord’s Prayer&quot;)
* &quot;Liber consolatorius ad Ludovicum regem de morte filii&quot; (&quot;Book to Console King Louis after the Death of His Son&quot;), (1260)
* &quot;Liber de laudibus beatae Virginis&quot; (&quot;The Book Praising the Blessed Virgin&quot;)
* &quot;Liber de laudibus Johannis Evangelistae&quot; (&quot;The Book Praising John the Evangelist&quot;)
* &quot;Liber de sancta Trinitate&quot; or &quot;Tractatus de sancta trinitate&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Holy Trinity&quot;), (1259–1260)
* &quot;Liber gratiae&quot; (&quot;The Book of Grace&quot;), (1259–1260)
* &quot;Memoriale temporum&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of the Times&quot;)
* Sermones manuals de tempore. (Johann Koelhoff d. Ä., Cologne c. 1482 digitized) 
* &quot;Tractatus de poenitentia&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Penance&quot;)
* &quot;Tractatus in salutatione beatae Virginis Mariae ab angelo facta&quot; (&quot;Treastie on the Salutation to the Blessed Virgin Mary Made by the Angel&quot;)

There are manuscript copies and modern editions of &quot;De eruditione filiorum nobilium&quot;, &quot;De morali principis institutione&quot;, &quot;Liber consolatorius ad Ludovicum regem de morte filii&quot;. There are only manuscript copies of &quot;Liber de sancta Trinitate&quot;, &quot;Memoriale temporum&quot;, &quot;Tractatus de poenitentia&quot;, and &quot;Tractatus in salutatione beatae Virginis Mariae ab angelo facta&quot;.

Beyond the thirteen works that can be confidently accredited to Vincent, there is the possibility of a lost work named &quot;Tractatus de vitio detractionis&quot; (&quot;Treastise on the Sin of Omission&quot;) and the apocryphal fourth part to the &quot;Great Mirror&quot;, &quot;Speculum morale&quot;.

Along with Conradus of Altzheim, Henricus Suso, Ludolphus of Saxony, the authorship of &quot;Speculum Humanae Salvationis&quot; has been sometimes attributed to Vincent.

<text>An office is a space where the employees of an organization perform administrative work in order to support and realize the various goals of the organization. The word &quot;office&quot; may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see officer or official); the latter is an earlier usage, as &quot;office&quot; originally referred to the location of one&#x27;s duty. In its adjective form, the term &quot;office&quot; may refer to business-related tasks. In law, a company or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of a storage silo. For example, instead of a more traditional establishment with a desk and chair, an office is also an architectural and design phenomenon, including small offices, such as a bench in the corner of a small business or a room in someone&#x27;s home (see small office/home office), entire floors of buildings, and massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company. In modern terms, an office is usually the location where white-collar workers carry out their functions.

In classical antiquity, offices were often part of a palace complex or a large temple. In the High Middle Ages (1000–1300), the medieval chancery acted as a sort of office, serving as the space where records and laws were stored and copied. With the growth of large, complex organizations in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed. As the Industrial Revolution intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of banking, rail, insurance, retail, petroleum, and telegraphy grew dramatically, requiring many clerks. As a result, more office space was assigned to house their activities. The time-and-motion study, pioneered in manufacturing by F. W. Taylor (1856–1915), led to the &quot;Modern Efficiency Desk&quot; of 1915. Its flat top, with drawers below, was designed to allow managers an easy view of their workers. By the middle of the 20th century, it became apparent that an efficient office required additional control over privacy, and gradually the cubicle system evolved.
==History==

The word &quot;office&quot; stems from the Latin &quot;officium&quot; and its equivalents in various Romance languages. An officium was not necessarily a place, but often referred instead to human staff members of an organization, or even the abstract notion of a formal position like a magistrate. The elaborate Roman bureaucracy would not be equaled for centuries in the West after the fall of Rome, with areas partially reverting to illiteracy. Further east, the Byzantine Empire and varying Islamic caliphates preserved a more sophisticated administrative culture.

Offices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace complex or a large temple. There was often a room where scrolls were kept and scribes did their work. Ancient texts mentioning the work of scribes allude to the existence of such &quot;offices&quot;. These rooms are sometimes called &quot;libraries&quot; by some archaeologists because of scrolls&#x27; association with literature. They were, however, closer to modern offices because the scrolls were meant for record-keeping and other management functions, not for poetry or works of fiction.

===Middle Ages===
The High Middle Ages (1000–1300) saw the rise of the medieval chancery, which was the place where most government letters were written and laws were copied within a kingdom. The rooms of the chancery often had walls full of pigeonholes, constructed to hold rolled-up pieces of parchment for safekeeping or ready reference. This kind of structure was a precursor to the modern bookshelf. The introduction of the printing press during the Renaissance did not impact the setup and function of these government offices significantly.

Medieval paintings and tapestries often show people in their private offices handling record-keeping books or writing on scrolls of parchment. Before the invention of the printing press and its wider distribution, there was often no clear cultural distinction between a private office and a private library; books were both read and written at the same desk or table, as were personal and professional accounts and letters.

During the 13th century, the English word &quot;office&quot; first began to appear when referring to a position involving specific professional duties (for example, &quot;the office of the...&quot;) Geoffrey Chaucer appears to have first used the word in 1395 to mean a place where business is transacted in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;.

As mercantilism became the dominant economic theory of the Renaissance, merchants tended to conduct their business in buildings that also sometimes housed people doing retail sales, warehousing, and clerical work. During the 15th century, the population density in many cities reached a point where merchants began to use stand-alone buildings to conduct their businesses. A distinction began to develop between religious, administrative/military, and commercial uses for buildings.

===The emergence of the modern office===
The first purpose-built office spaces were constructed in the 18th century to suit the needs of large and growing organizations such as the Royal Navy and the East India Company. The Old Admiralty (Ripley Building) was built in 1726 and was the first purpose-built office building in Great Britain. As well as offices, the building housed a board room and apartments for the Lords of the Admiralty. In the 1770s, many scattered offices for the Royal Navy were gathered into Somerset House, the first block purpose-built for office work.

The East India House was built in 1729 on Leadenhall Street as the headquarters from which the East India Company administered its Indian colonial possessions. The Company developed a very complex bureaucracy for the task, necessitating thousands of office employees to process the required paperwork. The Company recognized the benefits of centralized administration and required that all workers sign in and out at the central office each day.

As the Industrial Revolution intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of banking, rail, insurance, retail, petroleum, and telegraphy dramatically grew in size and complexity. Increasingly large number of clerks were needed to handle order processing, accounting, and document filing, and these clerks needed to be housed in increasingly specialized spaces. Most of the desks of the era were top-heavy and had a cubicle-like appearance, with paper storage bins extending above the desk-work area, offering workers some degree of privacy.

The relatively high price of land in the central core of cities led to the first multi-story buildings, which were limited to about 10 stories until the use of iron and steel allowed for higher structures. The first purpose-built office block was the Brunswick Building, built in Liverpool in 1841. The invention of the safety elevator in 1852 by Elisha Otis enabled the rapid upward escalation of buildings. By the end of the 19th century, larger office buildings frequently contained large glass atriums to allow light into the complex and improve air circulation.

===20th century===
By 1906, Sears, Roebuck, and Co. had opened their headquarters operation in a building in Chicago, at the time the largest building in the world. The time and motion study, pioneered in manufacturing by F. W. Taylor and later applied to the office environment by Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, led to the idea that managers needed to play an active role in directing the work of subordinates to increase the efficiency of the workplace. F.W. Taylor advocated the use of large, open floor plans and desks that faced supervisors. As a result, in 1915, the Equitable Life Insurance Company in New York City introduced the &quot;Modern Efficiency Desk&quot; with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers. This led to a demand for large square footage per floor in buildings, and a return to the open spaces that were seen in pre–industrial revolution buildings.

However, by the midpoint of the 20th century, it became apparent that an efficient office required more privacy in order to combat tedium, increase productivity, and encourage creativity. In 1964, the Herman Miller (office equipment) company contracted Robert Propst, a prolific industrial designer. Propst came up with the concept of the Action Office, which later evolved into the cubicle office furniture system.

Offices in Japan have developed unique characteristics partly as a result of the country&#x27;s unique business culture. Japanese offices tend to follow open plan layouts in an &#x27;island-style&#x27; arrangement, which promotes teamwork and top-down management. They also use &quot;uchi-awase&quot; (informal meetings) and &quot;ringi-sho&quot; (consensus systems) to encourage input on policies from as many groups throughout the office as possible.

==Office spaces==
The main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their jobs—preferably at minimum cost and with maximum satisfaction. Different people performing different tasks will require different office spaces, or spaces that can handle a variety of uses. To aid decision-making in workplace and office design, one can distinguish three different types of office spaces: workspaces, meeting spaces, and support spaces. For new or developing businesses, remote satellite offices and project rooms, or serviced offices, can provide a simple solution and provide all of the former types of space.

===Workspaces===
Workspaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing, and computer work. There are each supporting different activities.

Open office: an open workspace for more than ten people; suitable for activities that demand frequent communication or routine activities that need relatively little concentration.

Team space: a semi-enclosed workspace for two to eight people; suitable for teamwork which demands frequent internal communication and a medium level of concentration.

Cubicle: a semi-enclosed workspace for one person; suitable for activities that demand medium concentration and medium interaction.

Office Pod: ideal for fostering privacy in today&#x27;s bustling open-plan offices. It provides a cost-effective and efficient way to ensure privacy and continuity during conversations, calls, and video conferences.

Private office: an enclosed workspace for one person; suitable for activities that are confidential, demand a lot of concentration, or include many small meetings.

Shared office: a compact, semi-private workspace designed for two or three individuals, facilitating both focused work and small group collaboration.

Team room: an enclosed workspace for four to ten people; suitable for teamwork that may be confidential and demands frequent internal communication.

Study booth: an enclosed workspace for one person; suitable for short-term activities that demand concentration or confidentiality.

Work lounge: a lounge-like workspace for two to six people; suitable for short-term activities that demand collaboration and/or allow impromptu interaction.

Touch down: an open workspace for one person; suitable for short-term activities that require little concentration and low interaction.

===Meeting spaces===
Meeting spaces in an office typically use interactive processes, be they quick conversations or intensive brainstorming. There are each supporting different activities.

Small meeting room: an enclosed meeting space for two to four people; suitable for both formal and informal interaction.

Medium meeting room: an enclosed meeting space for four to ten people; suitable for both formal and informal interaction.

Large meeting room: an enclosed meeting space for ten or more people; suitable for formal interaction.

Small meeting space: an open or semi-open meeting space for two to four persons; suitable for short, informal interaction.

Medium meeting space: an open or semi-open meeting space for four to ten persons; suitable for short, informal interaction.

Large meeting space: an open or semi-open meeting space for ten or more people people; suitable for short, informal interaction.

Brainstorm room: an enclosed meeting space for five to twelve people; suitable for brainstorming sessions and workshops.

Meeting point: an open meeting point for two to four people; suitable for ad hoc, informal meetings.

===Support spaces===
Support spaces in an office are typically used for secondary activities such as filing documents or taking breaks. There are each supporting different activities.

Filing space: an open or enclosed support space for the storage of frequently used files and documents.

Storage space: an open or enclosed support space for the storage of commonly used office supplies.

Print and copy area: an open or enclosed support space with facilities for printing, scanning and copying.

Mail area: an open or semi-open support space where employees can pick up or deliver their mail.

Pantry area: an open or enclosed support space where employees can get refreshments and where supplies for visitor hospitality are kept.

Break area: a semi-open or enclosed support space where employees can take a break from their work.

Locker area: an open or semi-open support space where employees can store their personal belongings.

Smoking room: an enclosed support space where employees can smoke a cigarette.

Library: a semi-open or enclosed support space for reading books, journals and magazines.

Games room: an enclosed support space where employees can play games, such as pool or darts.

Waiting area: an open or semi-open support space where visitors can be received and wait for their appointment.

Circulation space: support space which is required for circulation on office floors, linking all major functions.

Lactation rooms are also support spaces that are legally mandatory for companies in the United States, as of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

==Office structure==
There are many different ways of arranging the space in an office. Managerial styles and the culture of specific companies are important factors in how office space will ultimately be used. One example of diverging office layout philosophies concerns how many people will work within the same room. At one extreme, each individual worker might have their own room; at the other extreme, a large open plan office might see tens or hundreds of people working in the same room. Open-plan offices put multiple workers together in the same space, and some studies have shown that they can improve short-term productivity, i.e. within a single software project. At the same time, the loss of privacy and security can increase the incidence of theft and loss of company secrets. A type of compromise between open plan and individual rooms is provided by the cubicle desk, possibly made most famous by the &quot;Dilbert&quot; cartoon series, which solves visual privacy to some extent but often fails on acoustic separation and security. Most cubicles also require the occupant to sit with their back towards anyone who might be approaching. Workers in walled offices typically try to position their normal work seats and desks so that they can see someone entering, and if that goal is not feasible, some install tiny mirrors on things such as computer monitors.

According to research, open-plan offices are associated with increased stress, a rise in electronic communication, a 70% decrease in face-to-face interactions, a 25% uptick in negative moods, and up to a 20% drop in productivity due to distractions. In contrast, post-pandemic trends are favoring private &quot;cell-office plans&quot;, which address health precautions and have been reported to enhance productivity by up to 22%.

==Office buildings==


While offices can be set up in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult. These requirements can be legal (such as sufficient light levels) or technical (such as requirements for computer networking). Other needs, such as security and layout flexibility, have prompted the creation of special buildings which are dedicated primarily for use as offices. An office building, also known as an office block or business center, is a form of commercial building which contains spaces mainly designed to be used for offices.

The primary purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment primarily for administrative and managerial workers. These workers usually occupy set up areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other equipments they may need within their areas.

An office building may be divided into sections for different companies, or it may be dedicated to one company. In either case, each company will typically have a reception area, one or several meeting rooms, singular or open-plan offices, and service rooms such as restrooms.

Many office buildings also have kitchen facilities and a staff room, where workers can have lunch or take a short break. Some office spaces are now also serviced office spaces, allowing for those occupying a space or building to share facilities.

==Office and retail rental rates==

Rental rates for office and retail space are typically quoted in terms of cost per floor-area–time, usually cost per floor-area per year or month. For example, the rate for a particular property may be $29 per square-foot per year ($29/sq. ft/yr) or $290 per square-meter per year ($290/m2/yr).

In many countries, rent is typically paid monthly, even if usually discussed in terms of years.

Examples:
* A particular 2,000 sq. ft space is priced at $15/sq. ft/yr, ultimately costing (2,000 sq. ft) × ($15/sq. ft/yr) / (12 mo/yr) = $2500 per month
* A particular 200 m2 space is priced at $150/m2/yr, ultimately costing (200 m2) × ($150/m2/yr) / (12 mo/yr) = $2500 per month

In a &quot;gross lease&quot;, the rate quoted is an all-inclusive rate. The renter pays a set amount of rent per time and the landlord is responsible for all other expenses, including payments for utilities, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs.

The &quot;triple net&quot; lease is one in which the tenant is liable for a share of various expenses such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, climate control, repairs, janitorial services and landscaping.

Office rents in the United States are still recovering from the high vacancy rates that occurred in the wake of the 2008 depression.

==Grading==

The Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) classifies office space into three categories: Class A, Class B, and Class C. According to BOMA, Class A office buildings have the &quot;most prestigious buildings competing for premier office users with rents above average for the area.&quot; BOMA states that Class A facilities have &quot;high-quality standard finishes, state of the art systems, exceptional accessibility and a definite market presence.&quot; BOMA describes Class B office buildings as those that compete &quot;for a wide range of users with rents in the average range for the area.&quot; BOMA states that Class B buildings have &quot;adequate systems&quot; and finishes that &quot;are fair to good for the area,&quot; but that the buildings do not compete at the same price rates as Class A buildings. According to BOMA, Class C buildings are aimed towards &quot;tenants requiring functional space at rents below the average for the area.&quot; The lack of specifics allows considerable room for pushing the boundaries of these BOMA categories. Oftentimes, they are further modified by adding the plus or minus sign to create subclasses, such as Class A+ or Class B-.

<doc id="382510" wikidata="Q814490" url="?curid=382510" title="Behind the Green Door">
<text>Behind the Green Door is a 1972 American pornographic film, widely considered one of the genre&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; pictures and one of the films that ushered in the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984). Featuring Marilyn Chambers, who became a mainstream celebrity, it was one of the first hardcore films widely released in the United States and the feature-length directorial debut of the Mitchell brothers.

&quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; was adapted from an anonymous short story of the same title, which was circulated by means of numerous carbon copies. The story&#x27;s title references the 1956 hit song &quot;Green Door&quot;, whose lyrics describe being denied entry to a raucous nightclub with a green door. Though she plays the central character, Chambers does not have a single word of dialogue. The film is possibly the first feature-length American heterosexual hardcore feature to include an interracial sex scene.

==Plot==
The manager of a diner asks two of his regular customers to tell him a supposedly true story that they had previously mentioned to him, involving a &quot;green door&quot;. The rest of the movie appears to be a dramatization of the story&#x27;s events, although no off-screen narration is heard.

After arriving at a North Beach hotel for an apparent vacation, a wealthy San Francisco socialite, Gloria Saunders (Chambers), is taken against her will to an elite sex club and loved &quot;as she&#x27;s never been loved before&quot;. She engages in sexual activity with a group of six women, all dressed in black, after being brought out wearing a white dress on stage through the green door.

The silent, largely masked audience become increasingly aroused as her white dress is removed and she is stroked, kissed and receives cunnilingus by the women. Her first heterosexual sex is with the African-American boxer Johnnie Keyes, accompanied by a funk soundtrack. He gives her more cunnilingus, and then they have sexual intercourse, while Gloria continues to be stroked by the other women. When she has an orgasm, the sex stops, and he is not shown to ejaculate.

Gloria then mounts a trapeze contraption suspended from the ceiling and then engages in vaginal intercourse with one man as she performs oral sex on another and manual sex on two others. The audience become further aroused and begin having sex with each other in what becomes an orgy. In a psychedelic key sequence, an ejaculation is shown with semen flying through the air for almost seven minutes. The film features several multicolored, optically printed, slow-motion close-ups of money shots. This is the only ejaculation sequence in the film. The narrator then runs from the audience, onto the stage, and carries Gloria off, through the green door. The film ends with him and Gloria making love alone.

==Impact==
Several years after Andy Warhol seminal &quot;Blue Movie&quot; in 1969, and along with &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, also released in 1972, &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; helped launch the &quot;Golden Age of Porn&quot; (1969–1984), and somewhat later, the &quot;porno chic&quot; boom. Along with &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, it was one of the first hardcore porn film to reach a mass mixed-sex audience. Prior to &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;, most of the Mitchell Brothers&#x27; 200 or so films had only been shown in their O&#x27;Farrell Theater. Made with a budget of $60,000, it achieved a nationwide theatrical release which earned more than $1 million. The movie ultimately grossed more than $50 million including its video release, which was controlled exclusively by the Mitchells out of their headquarters in the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre, San Francisco. It was one of the biggest box office pornographic successes of the 1970s, alongside &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;. It was even screened at the Cannes Film Festival. After its release, organized crime figures used extortion in an attempt to obtain the rights to the film.

Chambers was relatively unknown at the time; however, the film made her a star. Immediately prior to the movie&#x27;s release she had been the &quot;Ivory soap girl&quot;, modeling for the Ivory Snow soap and detergent packaging holding a baby. The Mitchell brothers appropriated the brand&#x27;s slogan &quot;99 and 44/100% pure&quot; to describe Chambers in press releases. After the release of the movie, the advertising industry was scandalized, and Procter &amp; Gamble recalled all products and advertising materials featuring Chambers, unintentionally adding to the movie&#x27;s hype. Procter &amp; Gamble subsequently required of all of their advertising agencies that they thoroughly screen the background of any female model employed for print advertisements or commercials. That Chambers&#x27;s image was so well known from Ivory Snow boosted the film&#x27;s ticket sales, and led to several jokes on television talk shows.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release, the film received some positive reviews in mainstream media. Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, writing that despite Chambers&#x27;s beauty the film&#x27;s lack of character development and the focus on &quot;proving how dirty it was&quot; were major detractions.

According to writer Peter Michelson, there is &quot;a relatively small corpus of pornographic films – e.g., &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;, and &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; – that have a minimal but still sufficient artistic interest to distinguish themselves from the rest of the genre&quot;, and the film is &quot;more artful than most smut films&quot;. It was the second film to be inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame, following &quot;Deep Throat&quot;.

==Legal troubles==
The Supreme Court&#x27;s 1973 &quot;Miller v. California&quot; decision adversely affected the mainstream release of porn films, including &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;. The Miller decision redefined obscenity from that of “utterly without socially redeeming value” to that which lacks &quot;serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value&quot; and substituted contemporary community standards for national standards, as some prior tests required. Miller continued to hold that obscenity was not protected by the First Amendment, which gave leeway to local judges to seize and destroy prints of films adjudged to violate local community standards. When &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; opened in Suffolk County, New York in 1973, it – along with the porn film &quot;The New Comers&quot; – was successfully prosecuted. In addition to New York, &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; was banned in California, Colorado, and Georgia.

==Later films==
In 1986, the Mitchells made a sequel, &quot;Behind the Green Door: the Sequel&quot;, directed by cabaret singer Sharon McNight. The movie featured no famous performers, and starred Elisa Florez, billed as &quot;Missy Manners&quot;. (Florez was Artie Mitchell&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, and she reportedly demanded the role from him.) It was one of the first &quot;safe sex&quot;-themed porn films, following the onset of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, with the performers using condoms and other protection. It was a critical and commercial disaster, and the Mitchells lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The O&#x27;Farrell Theatre contains a &quot;Green Door Room&quot; which is named for the two movies and was the principal set of the sequel.

In 2012, adult film company Vivid Entertainment produced a loose remake titled &quot;New Behind the Green Door&quot;. This film stars Brooklyn Lee as the main character Hope, a wealthy young woman drawn into a seedy underworld while on an erotic journey to find her birth mother. The movie includes footage of the original &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;, as Hope describes a sexual fantasy that recalls the plot of the 1972 film. Other cast members include Dana DeArmond, Penny Pax, Bailey Blue, Steven St. Croix, and James Deen, with appearances by original cast member Johnnie Keyes and Marilyn Chambers daughter McKenna Taylor.

==In popular culture==

* In the 1981 road-race comedy &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;, the driver of the Japanese team (played by Jackie Chan) attempts to watch a VHS tape of &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; on an in-dash monitor while driving on a rural highway. After several near-collisions due to his distracted driving, his partner in the back seat wakes up and forces him to shut it off.
* One of the &quot;Coming Attractions&quot; previewed in &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; is &quot;Catholic High School Girls in Trouble,&quot; which is described as &quot;more shocking than &quot;Behind the Green Door.&quot;&quot;
* The production of the movie is dramatized in the 2000 film &quot;Rated X&quot;, starring brothers Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez as Artie and Jim Mitchell.
* Actor Idris Elba&#x27;s choice to name his production company Green Door Productions (because &quot;I like doors and green is my favorite color&quot;) was questioned because of the association of the phrase with this film. He was intrigued to learn that it was one of the first porn films to feature interracial sex, and that it featured a seven-minute ejaculation sequence, which only made him want the name more, so that he could say that he&#x27;d chosen the name &quot;Because it took a long time to come.&quot;
* In 2024, when promoting &quot;Ricky Stanicky&quot;, John Cena jokingly cited &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; as his favorite guilty pleasure movie of all time.

<doc id="382511" wikidata="Q6070784" url="?curid=382511" title="Irish Georgian Society">
<text>The Irish Georgian Society is an architectural heritage and preservation organisation which promotes and aims to encourage an interest in the conservation of distinguished examples of architecture and the allied arts of all periods across Ireland, and records and publishes relevant material. The aims of this membership organisation are pursued by documenting, education, fundraising, grant issuance, planning process participation, lobbying, and member activities; in its first decades, it also conducted considerable hands-on restoration activities.

==History==
An earlier &quot;Georgian Society&quot; had been set up in part by John Pentland Mahaffy and functioned from 1908 to 1913; it had no direct connection with the current body although the society deems it to be its predecessor.

The initial catalyst for the establishment of the modern society was the demolition by the Irish government&#x27;s Office of Public Works of Georgian houses at numbers 2 and 3 Kildare Place in central Dublin, ostensibly to provide rear access to Government Buildings. While the campaign to save the buildings was ultimately unsuccessful, it did help to highlight the plight of other notable buildings in decline and at risk and ignited the spark which motivated like-minded individuals to found the society. In an open letter to the Irish Times in 1957 Desmond Guinness lamented the lapsing of the older Georgian Society and asked whether anyone would object to him restarting it.

The modern society was hence founded in 1958 by Desmond Guinness and his wife Mariga and since that time, a number of buildings of architectural merit have been saved through their work and the work of members and supporters. Among the first structures restored by the society was Conolly&#x27;s Folly in County Kildare, the image of which is used as the organisation&#x27;s emblem.

After Desmond Guinness, the next president of the society was Desmond FitzGerald, Knight of Glin, who died in 2011, followed by Patrick Guinness. Other founding members included Percy Le Clerc, the inspector of Irish National Monuments.

In 2006 the Hon. Desmond Guinness was awarded a Europa Nostra prize for the society&#x27;s preservation activities.

An illustrated book by Robert O&#x27;Byrne on the society&#x27;s first 50 years was published in 2008.

==Membership and funding==
The society is a membership organisation of about 2,000 members whose purpose is to promote awareness and the protection of Ireland&#x27;s architectural heritage and decorative arts. The society&#x27;s work within ireland was managed by the Irish-registered Irish Georgian Society (IGS), registered as a charity in 1970. 

In a major change, in 2008 a new entity called the Irish Georgian Foundation was given charge of the financial and charitable aspects, leaving the IGS as an unincorporated membership body. The boards of both were merged in 2013 for reasons of governance, and the IGF is now the operating legal entity, while the IGS name and logo are retained for emotive purposes, and IGS members support the work of the IGF but have no formal role in its governance or property ownership; they do have a limited role in choosing a nominal head.

There are headquarters in Dublin, and for the US branch, in Chicago.

The conservation efforts are funded by the members&#x27; participation in the society&#x27;s events programme, fundraising at central and chapter level, by donations and bequests and by sales from the society&#x27;s online book and gift shop. A large proportion of the society&#x27;s income comes from supporters outside Ireland. In the US, the organisation has been registered as a charity since 1968 as the Irish Georgian Society Inc. In the UK, the organisation fundraises as the &quot;Irish Georgian Trust&quot;.

===Chapters===
The society has semi-autonomous chapters in a number of locations, including Cork (founded 2003), Limerick (founded 1996), Birr (founded 1993, covering Ireland&#x27;s midlands since 2015), London (founded 1971), and in Boston, New York and Palm Beach, Florida in the US.

==Activities==
The activities of the Irish Georgian Society have included the saving of threatened great buildings such as Castletown House, County Kildare; Damer House, County Tipperary; Doneraile Court, County Cork; Roundwood, County Laois; the Tailors&#x27; Hall, Dublin and 13 Henrietta Street, Dublin, and the restoration of mid-eighteenth-century panelled rooms at Ledwithstown, County Longford; these were led by the first president, Desmond Guinness, and in the early years, his wife also.

Guinness retired from leadership in 1990. Projects since then include the repair of the early nineteenth-century south tower roof at Barmeath Castle, County Louth; the restoration of the pavilion cupolas of Kilshannig, County Cork, built in the 1760s to the designs of the Italian architect Davis Ducart; and, in association with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the World Monuments Fund and the Headfort Trust, the restoration of the superb Robert Adam decorative schemes at Headfort House, County Meath.

Another major project, which started in 2008, was the restoration of Dublin&#x27;s 1760s City Assembly House in South William Street, the first purpose-built public exhibition gallery in Britain or Ireland. From 1809 it was the debating chamber of Dublin Corporation for nearly a century, and was the scene of many famous speeches by Daniel O&#x27;Connell.

The society has also compiled and makes available a list of craftworkers skilled in the maintenance of historic buildings.

The society also publishes a yearly journal &quot;Irish Architectural and Decorative Studies&quot;.

===Events===
The society runs a range of events, educational, exploratory, instructional (for example for property owners), some for members, some open.

<doc id="382516" wikidata="Q2283013" url="?curid=382516" title="Sealing (Mormonism)">
<text>Sealing is an ordinance (ritual) performed in Latter Day Saint temples by a person holding the sealing authority. The purpose of this ordinance is to seal familial relationships, making possible the existence of family relationships throughout eternity. Sealings are typically performed as marriages or as sealing of children to parents. They were performed prior to the death of Joseph Smith (the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement), and are currently performed in the largest of the faiths that came from the movement, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). LDS Church teachings place great importance on the specific authority required to perform these sealings. Church doctrine teaches that this authority, called the priesthood, corresponds to that given to Saint Peter in .

==Sealings==

Faithful Latter Day Saints believe civil marriages are dissolved at death, but that a couple who has been sealed in a temple will be married beyond physical death and the resurrection if they remain faithful. This means that in the afterlife they and their family will be together forever. An illustrative difference in the marriage ceremony performed in the LDS Church&#x27;s temples is the replacement of the words &quot;until death do us part&quot; with &quot;for time and all eternity&quot;.

The LDS Church recognizes other monogamous, heterosexual marriages, both civil and religious, although they believe that such marriages will not continue after death because eternal marriages must be performed by priesthood authority. Eternal marriages are also performed vicariously for the deceased, of effect after receiving all other saving ordinances. As with sealings of living persons, they are sealed with their spouse and their children.

Couples who have children born to them before being sealed may have their children sealed to them afterwards. Couples who have children after being sealed need not have their children sealed to them in a separate ceremony. Children born to sealed parents are born in the covenant and are automatically sealed to their parents. Adopted children may be sealed to their adoptive parents once the adoption has been legally finalized.

The union of a sealed couple is regarded as valid only if both individuals have kept their religious covenants and followed Christ&#x27;s teachings. Just as deceased individuals may refuse any temple ordinance (such as a sealing) done by proxy on their behalf, couples, parents, and children who were sealed to each other in life may refuse to accept a sealing of which they were a part. No one will be sealed to any one with whom they do not want to be sealed.

Only worthy members of the LDS Church, who hold current valid temple recommends, can attend and witness sealings. Non-member family and friends generally wait in the temple waiting room during the sealing ceremony.

Since the LDS Church rejects same-sex marriages, these unions are not performed in temples and are not recognized by the church.

==Ceremony and vows==
A temple sealing for a living couple has the man and woman kneel on opposite sides of an altar in a temple sealing room while wearing ceremonial temple robes. They grasp each other&#x27;s right hand while facing double mirrors that create an infinite reflection. The male sealer then reads the following vows to groom (and then repeats the same vows with the changes noted in parentheses) to which they are to respond &quot;yes&quot;.

They are then pronounced husband and wife and promised blessings.

==Civil recognition==
Not all countries recognize marriages performed by clergy outside of the state religion. In these cases, temple marriages are not seen as legally binding, and a civil marriage must also be performed. In other cases, marriages must be performed in a public forum for any to witness or formally object. In such circumstances, government representatives or authorized clergy will perform the civilly-recognized public wedding prior to the temple sealing.

* In the United States and some other countries, bishops, stake presidents, and temple sealers have the civil authority to perform marriages. Marriages performed in the temple by a temple sealer are recognized by the government.
* In the United Kingdom the law requires that a marriage be performed at a public ceremony (the same also holds true for Austria). Since attendance at a temple sealing is restricted, a couple will be married locally by a person who is duly authorized to perform marriages. This person will usually be a registrar of marriages. The marriage can be performed at the local registrar&#x27;s office, or in some cases at an LDS meetinghouse. Some bishops or branch presidents have been officially given the title of a deputy registrar, and as such are legally able to perform a civil ceremony in the meetinghouse. The couple will then travel to the nearest LDS temple (London or Preston) for their temple sealing.
* In Brazil, all marriages must be performed in the state in which the couple resides. Since not all Brazilian states have a temple within their boundaries, the couple may then have their sealing performed at the nearest temple upon completion of the civil marriage. Also, according to Brazilian law, the sealing is recognized by the government as long as it respects the requirements for a civil marriage.
* In several countries (e.g. Argentina, Mexico, Germany) all marriages are performed at the local municipality by a registrar who is duly authorized to perform marriages. The couple will then go to the temple to have the sealing ordinance performed.

In May 2019, the LDS Church removed a prior one-year waiting period of couples deemed to be worthy between civil and temple marriage. In countries where a civil ceremony is required before marriage, the couples must receive their sealing as soon as practical after the civil ceremony.

==Cancellation==
Although a divorce dissolves a civilly-recognized marriage, the church still recognizes a sealing as binding. A couple who has been sealed may request to have their sealing canceled, which generally only occurs under special circumstances, and is only granted by the church&#x27;s president. Some refer to this informally as a &quot;temple divorce&quot;, but the terminology designated by church leaders is &quot;cancellation of a sealing&quot;. If a sealing is canceled, the sealing between them and any children remains in force, though the couple is no longer sealed. The sealing together of husband and wife and the sealing of children to parents are separate ordinances.

A cancellation typically follows after a civil divorce when a woman seeks to be sealed to another man. A man must apply for a sealing clearance to marry another woman after he has been civilly divorced, even if he has already received a cancellation of sealing.

==Legacy of plural marriage==
It has been argued that the LDS Church&#x27;s policy on sealings and cancellations reflect its doctrine of plural marriage. Although plural marriage is currently prohibited in the church, a man can be sealed to multiple women, in the case of widowers who are sealed to both their deceased and living wives. Additionally, men who are dead may be sealed by proxy to all women to whom they were legally married while alive. Recent changes in church policy also allow women to be sealed to multiple men, but only after both she and her husband(s) are dead.

LDS Church doctrine is not entirely specific on the status of men or women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. There are at least two possibilities:

# Regardless of how many people a man or woman is sealed to by proxy, they will only remain with one of them in the afterlife, and that the remaining spouses, who might still merit the full benefits of exaltation that come from being sealed, would then be given to another person in order to ensure each has an eternal marriage.
# These sealings create effective plural marriages that will continue after death. There are no church teachings clarifying whether polyandrous relationships can exist in the afterlife, so some church members doubt whether this possibility would apply to women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. The possibility for women to be sealed to multiple men is a recent policy change enacted in 1998. Church leaders have neither explained this change, nor its doctrinal implications. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely &quot;offered&quot; to the person in the afterlife.

<doc id="382518" wikidata="Q630780" url="?curid=382518" title="Merrion Square">
<text>Merrion Square () is a Georgian garden square on the southside of Dublin city centre.

== History ==

The square was laid out in 1762 to a plan by John Smyth and Jonathan Barker for the estate of Viscount FitzWilliam. Samuel Sproule later laid out the East side around 1780 and the gardens were created through a competition won by Benjamin Simpson in 1792 thanks to drawings created by John James Barralet. All of the surrounding houses were largely complete by the beginning of the 19th century.

Before the River Liffey was fully contained, floods on a high tide could reach as far as the square. In 1792, during one such event, the Duke of Leinster Augustus FitzGerald managed to sail a boat from Ringsend through a breach in the river wall as far as the north-east corner of Merrion Square (where it meets Holles Street).

During the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s, soup kitchens were set up in Merrion Square Park to help feed the citizens.

The demand for such Georgian townhouse residences south of the River Liffey had been fuelled by the decision of the then Earl of Kildare (later the Duke of Leinster) to build his Dublin home on the then undeveloped southside. He constructed the largest aristocratic residence in Dublin, Leinster House, second only to Dublin Castle.

Aristocrats, bishops and the wealthy sold their northside townhouses and migrated to the new southside developments.

== Legacy ==

All the original 18th century properties in Merrion Square have survived to the present day except for Antrim House which was demolished to make way for the National Maternity Hospital in the 1930s. Three sides are lined with Georgian redbrick townhouses; the West side abuts the grounds of Leinster House (seat of the Oireachtas), Government Buildings, the Natural History Museum and the National Gallery. The central railed-off garden is now a public park.

The Wellington Testimonial to commemorate the victories of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, was originally planned to be located in Merrion Square. However, it was built in the Phoenix Park after opposition from the square&#x27;s residents.

==Occupancy==
Until about the 1950s, the houses in the square were largely residential, but today most of them are used for office accommodation. The Irish Red Cross, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and the Irish Georgian Society have their headquarters on the square. The National Maternity Hospital is on the North terrace. 
The poet, novelist, and satirist Oscar Wilde lived at No. 1, poet W. B. Yeats lived at No. 82, and Daniel O&#x27;Connell at No. 58, the latter of which is now known as the O&#x27;Connell House, home to the Keough Naughton Centre of the University of Notre Dame, an American college. The fashion and interior designer Sybil Connolly lived at No. 71. A number of houses in the square have plaques with historical information on former notable residents, including A.E. (George William Russell) and Sheridan Le Fanu. Despite the square being largely occupied by commercial entities, there are still several residents, including fashion designer Louise Kennedy and tycoon Dermot Desmond.

Until 1972 the British Embassy was based at No 39. However, following the Bloody Sunday shootings in Northern Ireland, a crowd of over 20,000 people converged on the site in protest and the building was burnt to the ground. Currently, the Embassies of France, Korea and Slovakia are based on the south side of the square and the Church of Scientology&#x27;s National Affairs Office has been housed at No 4 on the north side since October 2016.

==Park==

The earliest plan of the park shows a double line of trees around the perimeter which was later enclosed by railings in the early years of the 19th century. A Jardin Anglaise approach was adopted for the layout of the park with contoured grass areas, informal tree clumps, sunken curved paths and perimeter planting.

Up until 1974, the park was only open to residents in possession of a private key. Now managed by Dublin City Council, the park contains a statue of Oscar Wilde, who resided in No. 1, Merrion Square from 1855 to 1876, many other sculptures and a collection of old Dublin lamp standards. Irish-American sculptor Jerome Connor, best known for his work &quot;Nuns of the Battlefield&quot; in Washington D.C., designed the public art piece, &quot;Eire&quot;. The park also contains a sculpture of a Joker&#x27;s Chair in memory of &quot;Father Ted&quot; star Dermot Morgan.

The park in the square was called &quot;Archbishop Ryan Park&quot;, after Dermot Ryan, the Catholic archbishop who transferred ownership to the city. In 2009, Dermot Ryan was criticised in the Murphy Report; in January 2010, Dublin City Council sought public views on renaming the Park. In September 2010, the City Council voted to rename the park as Merrion Square Park.

The park was also used by the St John Ambulance Brigade for annual events such as reviews and first aid competitions. The organisation was founded in 1903 by Sir John Lumsden KBE MD. During this time Dr Lumsden was living nearby at 4 Fitzwilliam Place. He was the chief medical officer at the Guinness Brewery and practised at Mercer&#x27;s Hospital.

During the First World War, both St. John Ambulance and the British Red Cross Society worked together in a joint effort as part of the war effort. This ensured services did not overlap with each other. Both organisations were a familiar sight among Irish people, particularly at Merrion Square where St. John Ambulance operated for almost 50 years. The headquarters of St. John Ambulance was situated at 40 Merrion Square during WWI later moving to 14 Merrion Square. Today they are located at Lumsden House, 29 Upper Leeson Street, Dublin 4 (see St John Ambulance archive for further info).

<text>Sir Edward William Stafford (23 April 1819 – 14 or 15 February 1901) served as the third premier of New Zealand on three occasions in the mid 19th century. His total time in office is the longest of any leader without a political party. He is described as pragmatic, logical, and clear-sighted.

==Early life and career==
Edward William Stafford was born on 23 April 1819 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the son of Berkeley Buckingham Stafford (High Sheriff of Louth in 1828) and Anne, the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Tytler. His family was prosperous, enabling him to receive a good education, first at the Royal School Dungannon in Ireland where he excelled as a scholar, and then at Trinity College Dublin. In 1841–1842, he undertook travel in Australia, but chose to join relatives in Nelson, New Zealand in 1843, where he soon became active in politics, criticising Governor Robert FitzRoy&#x27;s &quot;weak&quot; response to the Wairau Affray. In 1850, he joined increasing calls for New Zealand&#x27;s self-government, including universal suffrage.

In 1853, Stafford became the first Superintendent of Nelson Province. Among his achievements was the establishment of an education system (compulsory, free, and secular) which was later used as the basis of the national system. His administration of Nelson Province was well regarded by many.

When the New Zealand Parliament was opened, however, Stafford did not seek election, claiming that it was inappropriate to enter national politics while still holding provincial office. Despite requests from politicians such as Henry Sewell, Stafford declined to stand for parliament until the election of 1855, when he was elected MP for Nelson.

==Premier of New Zealand==



===First term===
When the position of Premier was created in 1856, Stafford refused to compete for the office. Instead, it was taken by Sewell. Sewell&#x27;s term, however, lasted only thirteen days, after which he was replaced by William Fox. Stafford refused offers of a ministerial position from both leaders. When Fox&#x27;s government fell, having lasted exactly the same number of days as Sewell&#x27;s, Stafford was deemed the only suitable candidate remaining, and agreed to become Premier. Stafford to date remains the youngest New Zealand Prime Minister on gaining office at 37 years, 5 weeks of age.

Among Stafford&#x27;s first acts as Premier were measures to define the relationship between central and provincial government. Also notable was the unofficial establishment of Cabinet, which met independently of the official Executive Council. This meant that much government business was conducted without the presence of the Governor, straining relations between Governor Thomas Gore Browne and parliament.

Stafford also clashed with the Governor on the subject of the distribution of powers, particularly responsibility for dealings with Māori. Thomas Gore Browne, disdainful of the chaotic nature of the Sewell and Fox premierships, did not believe that parliament should have control over such an important matter, while Stafford pursued his old goal of democratic self-government. Stafford, on behalf of the new government, refused all responsibility for financing actions undertaken by the governor without parliament&#x27;s approval.

In 1858 and 1859, Stafford was out of New Zealand, attempting to negotiate on the country&#x27;s behalf for various services. His trip proved problematic, however – during his absence, his colleagues and Governor Browne agreed to force Māori into selling land at Waitara, despite Stafford&#x27;s strong objections. Forcing Māori to sell their land triggered the First Taranaki War. Stafford condemned the decision on grounds of both economics and morality and considered resignation. Eventually, he chose to continue his premiership, but Stafford&#x27;s views on relations with the Māori were eventually to cause his departure regardless – attacks by William Fox on Stafford&#x27;s &quot;weakness&quot;, and Stafford&#x27;s lack of support for the Invasion of the Waikato, caused him to lose parliament&#x27;s confidence by a single vote in July 1861. William Fox became Premier once again.

When Fox&#x27;s government fell one year later, Stafford had the opportunity to become Premier again, but declined. His stated reason for doing so was his hostility to Governor George Grey, whom Stafford believed he would be unable to override on policy matters – Stafford did not wish to become Premier if the Governor would simply block his policies. Instead, Alfred Domett took the premiership. Domett&#x27;s premiership has been described as &quot;like a Stafford ministry without Stafford&quot;, although the invasion of the Waikato began in July 1863. Domett was replaced by Frederick Whitaker after little more than a year, but Whitaker himself only lasted a similar time before being replaced by Frederick Weld. Weld, like Domett, followed policies similar to Stafford, although did not enjoy good personal relations with him.

===Second term===

On 16 October 1865, when Weld retired due to ill health and stress, Stafford took up the premiership once again. As Premier, he continued Weld&#x27;s legislative program, but reduced what he saw as Weld&#x27;s excessive expenditure (this having been one of the issues that caused the dislike between the two men). His administration was marked by efficiency and frugality.

Stafford&#x27;s relations with the Governor were gradually deteriorating. In particular, there was considerable debate over responsibility for financing military activity against Māori in the New Zealand Wars. Stafford took the view that the conflict was essentially an &quot;imperial&quot; one, started and promoted by the British authorities. He objected to the British view that the colonial parliament should have primary responsibility for crushing the &quot;rebel&quot; tribes, and ignored the Governor&#x27;s complaints about drastically reduced military expenditure. When the British government finally surrendered responsibility for dealing with the Māori it demanded Stafford give substantial compensation for the costs of its military ventures. Stafford refused, and presented his own counter-claim for settler losses. In 1868, an agreement was reached where both sides would drop their claims.

Stafford&#x27;s government maintained generally good relations with Māori for some time. This exemplified by the establishment of Māori seats in parliament in 1867, and by Stafford&#x27;s request for the governor to pardon &quot;rebel&quot; Māori chiefs. The sudden military successes of Te Kooti and Titokowaru caused many to claim that Stafford&#x27;s attempts at reconciliation had been misjudged. Stafford sought to call an election and gain a fresh mandate, but his move was blocked by Governor George Bowen, who had a strong dislike of Stafford. Stafford&#x27;s government was defeated in 1869. His replacement was, once again, William Fox.

===Third term===
Fox&#x27;s government became increasingly dominated by its financial leader, Julius Vogel, and Stafford began to focus on him rather than on Fox. Stafford did not greatly disapprove of Vogel&#x27;s extensive public works plans, but complained that Vogel was reckless in their implementation. Fox&#x27;s diminishing control over his administration eventually allowed Stafford to reclaim the premiership in 1872. Stafford&#x27;s majority was small, however, and he was soon defeated in a vote of no confidence. With Bowen again refusing permission for an election, Stafford had no option but to resign. He was replaced by George Waterhouse.

Stafford briefly attempted to unify the opposition, but found too many disparate personalities. Increasingly, Stafford began to work with Julius Vogel – despite Stafford&#x27;s criticism of Vogel&#x27;s financial policies, and Vogel&#x27;s role in ending Stafford&#x27;s last premiership, the two shared many similar views. When Vogel became Premier, Stafford was offered a ministerial position, but declined on the grounds that he needed to attend to personal affairs.

==Later life==
Stafford resigned from Nelson on 19 November 1868, and was elected MP for Timaru on 20 November 1868. He represented that electorate until he resigned on 25 February 1878. When Vogel was seeking to retire, Stafford again had a chance to return to government, but again declined. Stafford retired in 1878, strongly disliking the new premiership of former governor George Grey.

Stafford spent considerable time in England, devoting himself to business pursuits. He was granted a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on his arrival, and was also offered governorships of Madras (now known as Chennai) and Queensland, which he declined. Upgraded to a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1887 Golden Jubilee Honours, Stafford died in London; sources differ whether this happened on 14 or 15 February 1901. He was survived by three daughters and three sons, the product of his marriage to Mary Bartley in 1859. Mary had died in 1899. A prior marriage to Emily Charlotte, daughter of William Wakefield, had been childless, with Emily having died in 1857 at the age of 29. Stafford&#x27;s lifespan paralleled that of Queen Victoria – he was born 31 days before the queen in 1819, and died 24 days after her in 1901.

<doc id="382525" wikidata="Q797466" url="?curid=382525" title="The Happy Prince and Other Tales">
<text>The Happy Prince and Other Tales (or Stories) is a collection of bedtime stories for children by Oscar Wilde, first published in May 1888. It contains five stories that are highly popular among children and frequently read in schools: &quot;The Happy Prince,&quot; &quot;The Nightingale and the Rose,&quot; &quot;The Selfish Giant,&quot; &quot;The Devoted Friend,&quot; and &quot;The Remarkable Rocket.&quot; The short stories are valued for their morals, and have been made into animated films.

In 2003, the second through fourth stories were adapted by Lupus Films and Terraglyph Interactive Studios into the three-part series &quot;Wilde Stories&quot; for Channel 4.

==Contents==

=== The Happy Prince ===

In a town full of suffering poor people, a swallow who was left behind after his flock flew off to Egypt for the winter meets the statue of the late &quot;Happy Prince,&quot; who has never experienced true sorrow, for he lived in a palace where sorrow was not allowed to enter. Viewing various scenes of people suffering in poverty from his tall monument, the Happy Prince asks the swallow to take the ruby from his hilt, the sapphires from his eyes, and the gold leaf covering his body to give to the poor. As winter comes and the Happy Prince is stripped of all of his beauty, his lead heart breaks when the swallow dies as a result of his selfless deeds and severe cold. The people, unaware of their good deeds, take the statue down from the pillar due to its shabbiness (intending to replace it with one of the Mayor) and melt the metal in a furnace, leaving behind the broken heart and the dead swallow, which are thrown in a dust heap. These are taken up to heaven by an Angel that has deemed them the two most precious things in the city. This is affirmed by God, and they live forever in His &quot;city of gold&quot; and garden of Paradise.

==== Adaptations ====

* A radio drama adaption by Columbia Workshop was broadcast on 26 December 1936.
* In 1941 Orson Welles and The Mercury Theatre broadcast a version on their &quot;Christmas Show,&quot; with music by Bernard Herrmann.
* Another radio version was broadcast in the Philco Radio Hall of Fame on 24 December 1944. This featured Orson Welles (narrator), Bing Crosby (as The Prince) and Lurene Tuttle as The Swallow.
* A record album called &quot;The Happy Prince&quot; was recorded on 21 August 1945 and issued in 1946 by American Decca Records, with Orson Welles narrating and Bing Crosby as the Prince.
*In 1968 the British group Bee Gees published the song &quot;When the Swallows Fly&quot; with clear references to &quot;The Happy Prince&quot;.
* In 1969 New Zealand group the La De Da&#x27;s released an album &quot;The Happy Prince&quot;, as a rock opera based on the story. Band members Bruce Howard and Trevor Wilson had conceived the idea in 1967, composing the music with Australian poet Adrian Rawlins narrating parts of Wilde&#x27;s story.
*Canadian producer Michael Mills, created an animated film adaptation of the story in 1974 starring Glynis Johns as the swallow and Christopher Plummer as the Prince.
* A major story arc in &quot;Journey to the West II&quot; presented the tale as the backstory of two antagonists. The Python Demon Queen (Angie Cheung) who is in love with the Interconnected-Arm Gibbon (Derek Kok), explained that she was once a swallow besotted with his statue of gold, and later helped the suffering commoners by stripping the statue of its treasures and distributing it.
* &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child&quot; presented a version of the title story set in New York City featuring Ed Koch as the Happy Prince (who was the statue of the city&#x27;s previous mayor) and Cyndi Lauper as a streetwise pigeon named &quot;Pidge&quot; (in place of the Swallow).

=== The Nightingale and the Rose ===
This story is an allegory of the moral decay and materialism of the age.

A nightingale overhears a student complaining that the professor&#x27;s daughter will not dance with him, as he is unable to give her a red rose; a lizard, a butterfly and a daisy laugh at the student for doing so. The nightingale visits all the rose-trees in the garden, and one of the roses tells her there is a way to produce a red rose, but only if the nightingale is prepared to sing the sweetest song for the rose all night with her heart pressing into a thorn, sacrificing her life. Seeing the student in tears, and valuing his human life above her bird life, the nightingale carries out the ritual and dies painfully. The student takes the rose to the professor&#x27;s daughter, but she again rejects him because the Chamberlain&#x27;s nephew has sent her some real jewels, and &quot;everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.&quot; The student angrily throws the rose into the gutter, returns to his study of metaphysics, and decides not to believe in true love anymore.

=== The Selfish Giant ===

The Selfish Giant owns a beautiful garden which has 12 peach trees and lovely fragrant flowers, in which children love to play after returning from school. On the giant&#x27;s return after visiting his friend the Cornish Ogre for seven years, he takes offence at the children and builds a wall to keep them out. He puts up a notice board &quot;TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED.&quot; The garden falls into perpetual winter. One day, the giant is awakened by a linnet, and discovers that spring has returned to the garden, as the children have found a way in through a gap in the wall. He sees the error of his ways, and resolves to destroy the wall. However, when he emerges from his castle, all the children run away except for one boy who was trying to climb a tree. The giant helps this boy into the tree and announces: &quot;It is your garden now, little children,&quot; and knocks down the wall. The children once more play in the garden, and Spring returns. But the boy that the Giant helped does not return, and the Giant is heartbroken. Many years later, after happily playing with the children all the time, the Giant is old and feeble. One winter morning, he awakes to see the trees in one part of his garden in full blossom. He descends from the castle to discover the boy that he once helped standing beneath a beautiful white tree. The Giant sees that the boy bears the stigmata. He does not realise that the boy is actually the Christ Child and is furious that somebody has wounded him.

Shortly afterwards, the happy giant dies. That same afternoon, his body is found lying under the tree, covered in blossoms.

=== The Devoted Friend ===
Once upon a time, there was a kind and honest man named Hans. He lived alone in a tiny cottage.

Hans was a little man who owned a beautiful garden, where he grew flowers of all kinds and colours which were sold in the market to make some money. He enjoyed the company of another man called Hugh, a miller who used to visit Hans very often during the summer time and with whom he shared thoughts about friendship and loyalty. Hans was so devoted to Hugh that he even gifted him whole bunches of flowers from his own garden.

However, when winter came, Hans found himself in a very difficult situation, as his flowers wouldn&#x27;t flourish anymore until the following spring, meaning that he was impoverished, living on a simple diet of a few pears and hard nuts. That winter was so stark that he had to sell some of his useful gardening tools, including his wheelbarrow, a silver chain, his pipe and some silver buttons. Meanwhile, the miller lived comfortably in his own house and avoided visiting his friend or helping him in any way, not to make him jealous and spoil, if not break, their friendship.

Finally, Spring came, and it was time for Hans to sell some of his primroses in order to buy back his silver buttons. Hugh finally visits him, and, hearing about his problem, he decides to kindly gift him his old, broken wheelbarrow in exchange for a few favours. Hans naively accepts the deal, but the unceasing requests of the miller keeps him busy to the point that he cannot tend his garden.

One day, Hans was asked to go and seek a doctor for Hugh&#x27;s son, who had hurt himself, but as it was a stormy and rainy night, he could barely see where he was going. After finding the doctor, on the way back home, he gets lost and drowns in a hole full of water.

Hugh, exaggerating his sadness, attends Hans&#x27;s funeral, and the linnet&#x27;s story is concluded with the following sentence: &quot;&#x27;A great loss to me at any rate,&#x27; answered the Miller; &#x27;why, I had as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don&#x27;t know what to do with it. It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair that I could not get anything for it if I sold it. I will certainly take care not to give away anything again. One always suffers for being generous.&#x27;&quot;

The water-rat, however, is unmoved by the story, saying that he would rather have not had listened to it, and disappears into his home.

This story has been adapted for comics by the cartoonist P. Craig Russell, in Volume 4 of &quot;Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde,&quot; which also includes &quot;The Nightingale and the Rose.&quot;

=== The Remarkable Rocket ===

This story concerns a firework, who is one of many to be let off at the wedding of a prince and princess. The rocket is extremely pompous and self-important, and denigrates all the other fireworks, eventually bursting into tears to demonstrate his &quot;sensitivity.&quot; As this makes him wet, he fails to ignite and, the next day, is thrown away into a ditch. He still believes he is destined for great public importance, and treats a frog, dragonfly, and duck that meet him with appropriate disdain. Two boys find him and use him as fuel for their camp-fire. The rocket is finally lit and explodes, but nobody observes him – the only effect he has is to frighten a goose with his falling stick.

&quot;The Remarkable Rocket,&quot; unlike the other stories in the collection, contains a large number of Wildean epigrams:

<doc id="382528" wikidata="Q6422305" url="?curid=382528" title="Knight of Glin">
<text>The Knight of Glin (; dormant 14 September 2011), also known as the Black Knight or Knight of the Valley, was an hereditary knighthood held by the FitzGerald and FitzMaurice families of County Limerick, Ireland, since the early 14th century. The family was a branch of the FitzMaurice/FitzGerald Dynasty commonly known as the Geraldines and related to the now extinct Earls of Desmond who were granted extensive lands in County Limerick by the Crown. The title was named after the village of Glin, near the Knight&#x27;s lands. The Knight of Glin was properly addressed as &quot;Knight&quot; (not, as one might expect, &quot;Sir ______ FitzGerald&quot;).

The family name &quot;FitzGerald&quot; comes from the (Norman) French &quot;Fils de Gerald,&quot; i.e. &quot;Son of Gerald.&quot;

::The coat-of-arms of the Glin family is: Ermine: a saltire gules. Crest: a boar passant gules, bristled and armed. Motto: Sahnit a Boo. The arms of the various families in Ireland are similar. The Knights of Glin bear as supporters two griffins collared and chained, and have a second crest: a castle with two towers, issuant from the sinister tower a knight in armor holding in the dexter hand a key proper. The Glin family seat is at Glin, Glin Castle, County Limerick, Ireland.

Like the Knights of Kerry, the Knights of Glin descended from one of the younger or illegitimate sons of The 1st Baron Desmond and Honora. There is confusion as to Honora&#x27;s parentage, as one source claims her to be the daughter of Phelim MacHugh O&#x27;Connor Don, of the family of the Kings of Connacht. Alternatively, she is stated to be the daughter of Hugh O&#x27;Connor Kerry, a wholly different family. Lord Desmond was also known as Sir John Fitz-John or &quot;Seán Mór na Sursainge&quot;, and he lived . The last knight, Desmond FitzGerald, 29th Knight of Glin, died on 14 September 2011.

== History ==
This Desmond family are descended from Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Llanstephan, a companion-in-arms of Strongbow Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, the Norman conqueror of Ireland. He went to Ireland in 1168, being sent with ten knights, twenty esquires, and one hundred archers, to assist Dermot MacMurrough, king of Leinster. He died 1 September 1177, buried in the friary of the Grey Friars of Wexford. Maurice was the second son of Gerald de Windsor, Constable of Pembroke, Wales and his wife given to him by Plantagenet Norman English King Henry II, the South Welsh Princess Nesta or Nest ferch Rhys thus descended from Howell the Good, king of the Britons who codified Welsh Law. Maurice FitzGerald&#x27;s children were:
Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald, justice of Ireland, who built the castle of Sligo and is ancestor of the Dukes of Leinster.
William, Baron of Naas, County Kildare, and ancestor of the Viscount Gormanston.
Thomas FitzMaurice FitzGerald married Elinor, daughter of Jordan de Marisco, and sister to Herve de Monte Marisco, constable of Ireland, and of Geoffrey de Marisco, Lord Justice of Ireland in the reign of King John. He died 1207.

John FitzGerald, 1st Baron Desmond, of Shanid, County Limerick, Lord of Connelloe and Decies, married (first) Margery, daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Fitz-Anthony, Lord of Decies and Desmond. These domains were confirmed to him by Prince Edward, the Black Prince in 1260. He married (second) Honora, daughter of Hugh O&#x27;Connor, of Kerry. 
By his first wife he had a son: 
1. Maurice Fitz-John FitzGerald, who was Lord of Decies and Desmond, and ancestor of the FitzGeralds, Earls of Desmond, who ranked among the most powerful nobles of Ireland for more than two centuries.
By his second wife he had issue:
2. Gilbert Fitz-John, ancestor of the White Knight.
3. Sir John Fitz-John, mentioned below.
4. Maurice Fitz-John, ancestor of the Knights of Kerry.
5. Thomas Fitz-John, ancestor of the Fitzgerald of the Island of Kerry.

John Fitz-Thomas FitzGerald, by virtue of his royal seigniory as a Count Palatine, created three of his sons by the second marriage, knights; and their descendants have been so styled in acts of parliament, patents under the great seal, and all legal proceedings, up to the present (1910) time. He founded the monastery of Tralee, and was buried there in 1260.

(VII) Sir John Fitz-John, Knight, was the first Knight of Glin, and had from his father the castles of Glincarbery and Beagh, county Limerick, Ireland.
Children:
John Fitz-John, mentioned below.
Gerald Fitz-John, ancestor of the family of Clenlish and Castle Ishen, County Cork, Baronets.

VIII) Sir John Fitz-John del Glin was succeeded by his son.

::&quot;The earliest tradition I could find about Glin went back to 1569, when the [15th] knight, Thomas FitzGerald, was barbarously executed in Limerick. His mother, who was present at the execution, seized his head when he was beheaded and drank his blood. She then collected the parts of his dismembered body and put them in a linen sheet. When she set out for home with her precious burden she was followed by an immense concourse, including one hundred keening women.

::Somewhere east of Foynes some soldiers tried to seize the corpse and in the fight that followed many people were slain. The body was interred in Lislaughtin Abbey in the tomb of his relative, the O&#x27;Connor Kerry.&quot;

According to another legend, in the early 16th century under Elizabeth I, England set about enforcing loyalty in the western parts of Ireland. When one of her ships came up to the Knight of Glin&#x27;s castle on the Shannon Estuary, a fierce battle ensued. The ship&#x27;s captain managed to capture one of the Knight&#x27;s sons and sent the Knight a message that he should surrender or else the son would be put in one of the ship&#x27;s cannons and fired against the castle wall. He replied that as he was virile and his wife was strong, it would be easy to produce another son.

::The tradition about the siege of Glin castle differs in many respects from the facts as given by Carew in &quot;Pacata Hibernia&quot;. We do know that tradition can be a completely distorting mirror, but the popular memory of a local event such as a battle, siege or massacre would be more vivid and more lasting and in essence more trustworthy than Carew&#x27;s narrative, who was prejudiced and gives a complete travesty of the facts.

::The garrison of the castle, according to tradition, was divided into two sections, one of which was commanded by Donall na Searrach Culhane and the other by Tadhg Dore. Before the siege began, Carew, who had the knight&#x27;s child as hostage, sent an order to the knight to surrender the castle at once or else he would blow the child out of the mouth of the cannon. The knight&#x27;s answer was remembered but can only be rendered here by algebraic symbols: &quot;Gread leat. Ta X go meidhreach fos agus Y go briomhar. Is fuiriste leanbh eile do gheiniuint&quot;.

::The assault on the castle then began under the command of Capt. Flower but was beaten back with slaughter by the defenders. Three brothers named Giltenan played a heroic part in repulsing the attack and slew some of the best of Flower&#x27;s men. Carew called up fresh reinforcements, which he placed under the leadership of Turlough Roe MacMahon, who lived at Colmanstown castle, County Clare, almost opposite Glin. Turlough was a man of evil reputation who had already committed many dreadful crimes against his own kith and kin and against the Irish people at large. He was the father of the celebrated Maire Ruadh MacMahon. He is referred to in a poem of the time as

:::&quot;Traolach Ruadh an fhill agus an eithigh&quot;
:::do mhairbh a bhean agus a leanbh in eineacht.
(&quot;Turlough Roe, the turncoat and vulture,/Killed his wife and child together.&quot;)

::The second assault also failed, but Turlough was determined to carry it through, for he hated with a hatred which evil men are known to feel towards those they have mortally injured. In the meantime the cannonading had played havoc with the defences of the castle. In the third attempt MacMahon was able to move in a large body of men who, after a gallant defence by the garrison, succeeded in capturing the castle. The Giltenans, Tadhg Dore and his brother, and Donall Culhane and two of his sons were slain in the final defence. Some of the garrison tried to escape by jumping into the water surrounding the castle, but only three men succeeded in getting away. These were Mahon Dillane, Lewy O&#x27;Connor and Donall Beag Culhane (whose father was slain in the last defence of the castle).

The &quot;old castle&quot; of Glin, the scene of the above battle, is a ruin. The tower still stands with a historic plaque in place. After the destruction of the old castle, the Knights built the &quot;new castle&quot;, a Georgian mansion, on the banks of the Shannon Estuary about a mile west of the old site. The last Knight lived there until his death (as well as in Dublin and London).

The 17th Knight, Gerald FitzGerald, was a Member for County Limerick in the Irish Patriot Parliament of 1689, called by James II during the Williamite war.

Under the Penal Laws of the 18th century, the Knights converted to the Church of Ireland to preserve their property. The surrounding villagers remained Roman Catholics, a division indicated today by the two churches in the village of Glin.

Following the war of independence and during the ensuing Civil War, in the early 1920s, Irish Republican Army (IRA) soldiers, from nearby North Kerry came to the 27th Knight Desmond FitzJohn Lloyd FitzGerald to tell him that no one whose title to land came from the English Crown could keep their land. The Knight immediately produced a document in Latin, supposedly from Duke of Normandy, indicating that his title did not originate from the English Crown at all. The baffled IRA men left the Knight with his properties, which he holds to this day. Another version of the incident relates how the then Knight, who was an invalid and used a wheelchair, refused to leave the mansion when ordered to do so, as the IRA intended to set it alight. He insisted on staying, they left, and the mansion still stands.

The 29th and last Knight (dormant or extinct) was Desmond FitzGerald, son of Desmond Wyndham Otho FitzGerald, 28th Knight of Glin. He had a MFA degree from Harvard University. He was married, firstly in 1966, to Louise Vava Henriette Lucie Le Bailly de La Falaise, the daughter of Count Alain de la Falaise and his wife, the former Maxime Birley. By his second, the former Olda Ann Willes, whom he married in 1970, he had three daughters: Catherine (previously married to Edward Lambton, 7th Earl of Durham, remarried in 2010 to Dominic West), Nesta and Honor. He represented the art auctioneers Christie&#x27;s in Ireland and was elected president of the Irish Georgian Society. Since he had no male heir, the title Knight of Glin became apparently dormant or extinct. There has been some speculation that there is an heir male of the body needing to prove their claim to the title, surviving through the 24th Knight of Glin, Lt. Col. John Fraunceis FitzGerald&#x27;s second son Edmond Urmston McLeod FitzGerald, who was born in 1817 at Glin Castle and who married Ellen Sullivan, born in Ireland, 1822, died in Ogdensburg, New York, United States, in December 1895.
Children, born in Ireland:
Edmond Urmston, deceased.
Richard, mentioned below.
John Fraunceis, living in Ogdensburgh,
Margaret.
Gerald, who died in Ireland.

<doc id="382530" wikidata="Q3071515" url="?curid=382530" title="Field, British Columbia">
<text>Field is an unincorporated community of approximately 169 people located in the Kicking Horse River valley of southeastern British Columbia,
Canada, within the confines of Yoho National Park. At an elevation of , it is west of Lake Louise along the Trans-Canada Highway, which provides the only road access to the town. The community is named for Cyrus West Field of Transatlantic telegraph cable fame, who visited the area in 1884.

== Demographics ==
In 2011, Field had a population of 195 year-round residents.

== Townsite administration ==

Field&#x27;s land ownership was split between the Crown and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), with the border between the two jurisdictions being Stephen Avenue. The railway was in charge of the water and electricity supply for the town until the 1950s, when the Canadian government took over. Today, the townsite is managed by Parks Canada. Local residents lease their land from the park administration, with a term of 42 years.

== Burgess Shale ==

CPR track workers in Field discovered the fossils of the Burgess Shale. Commonly called by the workers &quot;the stone bugs&quot;, the first fossils were discovered on Mount Stephen. In 1909, Charles D. Walcott discovered the Walcott Quarry on the slope of Mount Field.

<text>Harold Abelson (born April 26, 1947) is an American mathematician and computer scientist. He is a professor of computer science and engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a founding director of both Creative Commons and the Free Software Foundation, creator of the MIT App Inventor platform, and co-author of the widely-used textbook &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; (SICP), sometimes also referred to as &quot;the wizard book&quot; because of its cover illustration.

He directed the first implementation of the language Logo for the Apple II, which made the language widely available on personal computers starting in 1981; and published a widely selling book on Logo in 1982. Together with Gerald Jay Sussman, Abelson developed MIT&#x27;s introductory computer science subject, &quot;The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; (often referred to by the MIT course number, 6.001), a subject organized around the idea that a computer language is primarily a formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology, rather than just a way to get a computer to perform operations. 

Abelson and Sussman also cooperate in codirecting the MIT Project on Mathematics and Computation. The MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) project was spearheaded by Abelson and other MIT faculty.

Abelson led an internal investigation of MIT&#x27;s choices and role in the prosecution of Aaron Swartz by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which concluded that MIT did nothing wrong legally, but recommended that MIT consider changing some of its internal policies.

==Education==
Abelson graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Princeton University in 1969 after completing a senior thesis on &quot;Actions with fixed-point set: a homology sphere&quot;, supervised by William Browder.

He received his PhD in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973 after completing his research on &quot;Topologically distinct conjugate varieties with finite fundamental group&quot; supervised by Dennis Sullivan.

==Career and research==
Abelson is also a founding director of Creative Commons and Public Knowledge, and a director of the Center for Democracy and Technology.

===Computer science education===
Abelson has a longstanding interest in using computation as a conceptual framework in teaching. He directed the first implementation of Logo for the Apple II, which made the language widely available on personal computers starting in 1981; and published a widely selling book on Logo in 1982. His book &quot;Turtle Geometry,&quot; written with Andrea diSessa in 1981, presented a computational approach to geometry which has been cited as &quot;the first step in a revolutionary change in the entire teaching/learning process.&quot; In March 2015, a copy of Abelson&#x27;s 1969 implementation of Turtle graphics was sold at The Algorithm Auction, the world’s first auction of computer algorithms.

Together with Gerald Jay Sussman, Abelson developed MIT&#x27;s introductory computer science subject, &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,&quot; a subject organized around the notion that a computer language is primarily a formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology, rather than just a way to get a computer to perform operations. This work, through the textbook of the same name, videotapes of their lectures, and the availability on personal computers of the Scheme dialect of Lisp (used in teaching the course), has had a worldwide impact on university computer science education.

He is a visiting faculty member at Google, where he was part of the &quot;App Inventor for Android&quot; team, an educational program aiming to make it easy for people with no programming background to write mobile phone applications and &quot;explore whether this could change the nature of introductory computing&quot;. He is coauthor of the book &quot;App Inventor&quot; with David Wolber, Ellen Spertus, and Liz Looney, published by O&#x27;Reilly Media in 2011. After Google released App Inventor as open source software in late 2009 and provided seed funding to the MIT Media Lab in 2011, Abelson became codirector of the MIT Center for Mobile Learning to continue development of App Inventor.

===Computing tools===
Abelson and Sussman also cooperate in codirecting the MIT Project on Mathematics and Computation, a project of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), formerly a joint project of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI Lab) and MIT Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS), CSAIL&#x27;s components. The goal of the project is to create better computational tools for scientists and engineers. But even with powerful numerical computers, exploring complex physical systems still requires substantial human effort and human judgement to prepare simulations and to interpret numerical results.

Together with their students, Abelson and Sussman are combining methods from numerical computation, symbolic algebra, and heuristic programming to develop programs that not only perform massive numerical computations, but that also interpret these computations and &quot;discuss&quot; the results in qualitative terms. Programs such as these could form the basis for intelligent scientific instruments that monitor physical systems based upon high-level behavioral descriptions. More generally, they could lead to a new generation of computational tools that can autonomously explore complex physical systems, and which will play an important part in the future practice of science and engineering. At the same time, these programs incorporate computational formulations of scientific knowledge that can form the foundations of better ways to teach science and engineering.

===Free software movement===
Abelson and Sussman have also been a part of the free software movement (FSM), including serving on the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

Abelson is known to have been involved in publishing Andrew Huang&#x27;s &quot;Hacking the Xbox&quot; and Keith Winstein&#x27;s seven-line Perl DeCSS script (named qrpff), and Library Access to Music Project (LAMP), MIT&#x27;s campus-wide music distribution system. The MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) project was spearheaded by Hal Abelson and other MIT faculty.

===Aaron Swartz investigation===

In January 2013, open access activist Aaron Swartz died by suicide. He had been arrested near MIT and was facing up to 35 years imprisonment for the alleged crime of downloading &quot;Journal Storage&quot; (JSTOR) articles through MIT&#x27;s &quot;open access&quot; campus network.

In response, MIT appointed professor Hal Abelson to lead an internal investigation of the school&#x27;s choices and role in the prosecution of Aaron Swartz by the FBI. The report was delivered on July 26, 2013. It concluded that MIT did nothing wrong legally, but recommended that MIT consider changing some of its internal policies.

<doc id="382536" wikidata="Q5474165" url="?curid=382536" title="Lincoln Bank Tower">
<text>The Lincoln Bank Tower in Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States, is an Art Deco highrise building. Construction started in late 1929 with the building&#x27;s opening on November 16, 1930. For decades, it was the tallest building in the state. The building was also known as &quot;Lincoln Bank Tower&quot; to distinguish it from the building at 215 Berry Street, which had been known as the &quot;Lincoln Life Building&quot; from 1912 until 1923. Today, the other building is commonly known by its original name, the Elektron Building.

== History ==
Lincoln National Bank and Trust was chartered as The German American National Bank in 1905. Due to anti-German sentiment that arose from World War I, the German American National Bank became Lincoln National Bank on May 31, 1918.

The choice of Lincoln as a name was appealing. Not only was it a very American name, the thriving Lincoln National Life Insurance Company—also founded in 1905—was down the street. People were still excited about the Lincoln Highway (&quot;the main street of America&quot;) that passed through Fort Wayne to be the first coast-to-coast highway in the United States. In 1928, Lincoln National Bank merged with Lincoln Trust Company (formerly known as Strauss Brothers Commercial Bank) to become Lincoln National Bank and Trust.

Shortly after Lincoln National Bank and Trust was formed, President Charles Buesching commissioned a skyscraper to serve as headquarters for the new bank. Buesching considered it to be a monument to the German immigrants who settled the Fort Wayne area at the turn of the 20th century and formed the backbone of his investors, depositors, and customers. Buesching himself was a German immigrant.

Alvin M. Strauss of Fort Wayne was architect, while Buesching and Hagerman were contractors for the building. Some design elements were based on the Tribune Tower in Chicago. Ground was broken on August 16, 1929, for the building. Despite the Great Crash of the stock market on October 24, construction continued on the $1.3 million structure.

It was the tallest building of any kind in the state until 1962 and the tallest in Fort Wayne until the Fort Wayne National Bank Building (known as National City Center from 1999 to 2009 and as PNC Center since 2009) was built in 1970. 

In 1995, the former Lincoln National Bank and Trust, by then part of Norwest Bank, moved into new facilities at Norwest City Center (now known as Wells Fargo Indiana Center). Lincoln Tower was 60% vacant after this move. In 1997, Lincoln Tower was sold at a sheriff&#x27;s sale. There had been a $2 million default on the mortgage of a building that originally cost $1.3 million to build. In 1998, Tippmann Properties bought Lincoln Tower, and began to carefully refurbish it. A new bank, calling itself Tower Bank, announced it would open in Lincoln Tower, occupying the lobby and some office space. The new bank used a stylized gold version of the Lincoln Bank Tower as its corporate logo, which was designed by prominent Fort Wayne ad agency Boyden &amp; Youngblutt.

Old National Bank acquired Tower Bank in April 2014 and made the Lincoln Bank Tower its Fort Wayne banking market headquarters. Old National also kept the Lincoln Bank Tower banking center and many of Tower&#x27;s executives. It also retained Tower Private Advisors, the private banking arm of Tower Bank, along with the Lincoln Tower office, and merged it into Old National Wealth Management. Until 2016, Old National also maintained an insurance operation in Fort Wayne, located in Aboite Township. This division was sold and rebranded as ONI Risk Partners.

In 1996, this building was the backdrop in several scenes of &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;, a film written and directed by Neil LaBute. The main bank lobby was the setting of the final shot. The apartment shown at the end of the movie was the room that is used as the deli in the main lobby. Other scenes were filmed in restrooms and various office spaces throughout the building, including a shot from the roof overlooking the Allen County Courthouse. Twenty years later, Old National Bank and its advertising agency Publicis filmed portions of a television commercial in the bank&#x27;s lobby. This commercial was aired throughout Old National&#x27;s market footprint, including to introduce the bank to Wisconsin after the acquisition of a bank in that state.

== Building details ==

Seven bronze panels at the main entrance depict scenes from the life of President Abraham Lincoln. The building is constructed of 1,774 tons of structural steel, faced with 21,250 cubic feet of cut Indiana limestone and granite with gold highlights. It features lead spandrel panels, a 58-ton terra-cotta crown, and 500 tons of marble. At the top of the building is a slender observation tower topped by a flagpole.

Between the entrance and the lobby is a snack shop with the original 1930 soda fountain still in use. The main banking lobby itself is wide, long, and two stories tall. It contains large art deco murals depicting the industries and the seasons, using elemental symbolism from Greek and Egyptian traditions, such as a female form to represent fecundity and the sun to represent energy. Materials include hand-wrought bronze, Milford granite, Italian Travertine marble, several rate types of green Vermont marble, and Indiana limestone.

<text>Forest falcons are members of the genus Micrastur, part of the family Falconidae. They are endemic to the Americas, found from Mexico in the north, south through Central America and large parts of South America, and as far south as northern Argentina. Most are restricted to humid tropical and subtropical forests, but the two most widespread species, the collared and the barred forest falcon, also range into drier and more open habitats.

Forest falcons, like most &quot;Accipiter&quot;-type hawks (but unlike other falcons), are adapted for agility in thick cover rather than outright speed in the open air. They have short wings, long tails, and extraordinarily acute hearing. While generally visually inconspicuous, their songs are commonly heard.

Their diet is a mixture of birds, mammals, and reptiles. Hunting is often performed in goshawk fashion: the bird takes up a perch in an inconspicuous position and waits for a prey species to pass, then strikes with a short, rapid pursuit. Forest falcons are inventive, flexible hunters, and at least some species (such as the relatively long-legged collared forest falcon) are also capable of catching terrestrial prey on foot.

In 2002, a new species was described, found in the Atlantic forest and the southeastern Amazon of Brazil (and later also confirmed for adjacent parts of Bolivia). It has been named &quot;Micrastur mintoni&quot;, the cryptic forest falcon, as it is phenotypically highly similar to &quot;M. gilvicollis&quot;.

==Species==
== Taxonomy and systematics ==

&quot;Micrastur&quot; was defined by George Robert Gray in the second edition of his &quot;List of the Genera of Birds&quot; in 1841. The type species was Temminck&#x27;s &quot;Falco brachypterus&quot;, with Illiger&#x27;s &quot;Falco concentricus&quot; as a synonym. 

Composition of species comprising the genus has varied, with differing opinions on whether particular populations are species or subspecies, and whether collected specimens were different life stages or plumage variants of the same species. 

Sclater and Salvin commented in 1869 that &quot;some of the members of the genus &quot;Micrastur&quot; are at present in a state of great confusion&quot;. They listed seven species, of which four are currently recognised and three are considered subspecies. 

In 1873, Robert Ridgway noted the similarity of &quot;Micrastur&quot; to the laughing falcon &quot;Herpetotheres&quot;. He wrote that &quot;Eight species are given in Gray’s Hand List…, but of this number only five are tenable.&quot;

<text>Biovail Corporation was a Canadian pharmaceutical company, operating internationally in all aspects of pharmaceutical products. Its major production facility was located in Steinbach, Manitoba. It merged with Valeant Pharmaceuticals International in 2010.

==History==

As noted in the February 2009 Settlement Agreement with the Ontario Securities Commission: &quot;Biovail admitted that [...] it violated Ontario securities law and engaged in conduct contrary to the public interest.&quot;

On September 28, 2010, Biovail merged with Valeant Pharmaceuticals (Bausch Health). The company retained the Valeant name and J. Michael Pearson as CEO, but was incorporated in Canada and temporarily kept Biovail&#x27;s headquarters.

===Legal issues===

==== Aplenzin securities fraud class action ====
A class action suit was filed against Biovail by investors who between December 14, 2006, and July 19, 2007, bought Biovail stock, alleging that the company had failed to disclose that the multi-dose study on depression drug Aplenzin would not be sufficient for the FDA to approve it. The lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in 2009, with Judge Colleen McMahon describing the complaint as &quot;legally baseless.&quot; 

====SAC/Gradient Analytics lawsuit and SEC complaint====
In March 2006, CBS program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; featured Biovail in a story about its lawsuit against hedge fund SAC Capital Partners and Camelback (now known as Gradient Analytics), among others. According to Eugene Melnyk, &quot;there&#x27;s a group of people that got together and essentially attacked the company by putting out false reports, and we&#x27;re just fighting back for our shareholders.&quot;

The alleged conspiracy began with Camelback, an Arizona stock-analysis firm that advertises that it publishes impartial financial reports on companies to help investors evaluate stocks. In the spring of 2003, the hedge fund SAC asked them for a report on Biovail. Darryl Smith, Mark Rosenblum, Demetrios Anifantis, and Robert Ballash, former Camelback employees, alleged that Camelback had allowed their client SAC to determine the content and timing of their reports on Biovail.

Camelback said those former employees were lying and disgruntled, that Anifantis and Ballash were fired because of unethical conduct; Smith for poor performance; Rosenblum was laid off. These four say they were let go after they complained to their superiors about Camelback&#x27;s practices. SAC denied all the charges in Biovail&#x27;s lawsuit and said that the decline in the Biovail&#x27;s stock was due to earnings shortfalls and regulatory investigations.

In March 2008, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Biovail and some of its former officers, alleging that &quot;present and former senior Biovail executives, obsessed with meeting quarterly and annual earnings guidance, repeatedly overstated earnings and hid losses in order to deceive investors and create the appearance of achieving earnings goals. When it ultimately became impossible to continue concealing the company&#x27;s inability to meet its own earnings guidance, Biovail actively misled investors and analysts about the reasons for the company&#x27;s poor performance.&quot; Biovail settled for . Gradient Analytics, successor to Camelback, issued a press release stating that the SEC&#x27;s suit &quot;confirms the validity of Gradient&#x27;s critical analysis of Biovail but raises serious questions about how companies retaliate against analysts with threats, intimidation, and lawsuits.&quot;

&quot;60 Minutes&quot; has been accused of botching the Biovail story by the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;″s Audit columnist and &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Joe Nocera, who felt Lesley Stahl accepted Biovail&#x27;s conspiracy theories about short sellers without proper consideration.
SAC and Gradient filed a suit against Biovail for malicious prosecution in February 2010. On September 28 Biovail merged into Valeant Pharmaceuticals Inc. On November 4 Valeant announced that they had settled with Gradient, saying &quot;The initiation of litigation against Gradient, its founders Dr. Carr Bettis and Dr. Donn Vickrey, and others in 2006 by Biovail&#x27;s management at the time was regrettable. We would like to put this incident behind us.&quot;

====Penalties against Eugene Melnyk====
In May 2011, the Ontario Securities Commission in Canada banned Eugene Melnyk from senior roles at public companies in Canada for five years and fined him $565,000. Earlier in the same year Melnyk had settled with the US SEC, agreeing to pay a civil penalty of US$150,000; he had previously paid US$1 million to settle other claims with the SEC.

<text>Robin&#x27;s Donuts (commonly shortened to Robin&#x27;s) is a Canadian chain of over 160 fast food restaurants that operate in every province of Canada except Quebec. A 2017 Maclean&#x27;s Magazine Poll ranked Robin&#x27;s as the 7th best coffee chain out of 15 in Canada.

==History==
Harvey Cardwell and George Spicer opened the first store in 1975 in Thunder Bay, Ontario as &quot;Robin&#x27;s Donuts&quot;.

In October 2006, Chairman&#x27;s Brand Corporation took ownership of Robin&#x27;s Donuts when it purchased Afton Food Group, the former owner of Robin&#x27;s Donuts, 241 Pizza and Mrs. Powell&#x27;s Cinnamon Buns.

In 2014 a new logo was created which dropped &quot;Donuts&quot; from the name; this is likely because of the growing number of alternative new menu items.

On September 26, 2024, Robin&#x27;s announced plans to expand once again in the Southern Ontario market; a market where it closed most of its&#x27; locations in the early 2000&#x27;s due to increased competition from rival Tim Hortons.

<doc id="382547" wikidata="Q1930798" url="?curid=382547" title="Nurse with Wound">
<text>Nurse with Wound (abbreviated NWW) is the main recording name for British musician Steven Stapleton. Nurse with Wound was originally a band, formed in 1978 by Stapleton, John Fothergill and Heman Pathak. The band&#x27;s work has explored genres such as industrial, noise, dark ambient, and drone.

==Musical output==
Their early recordings, all made quickly, were heavily influenced by free improvisation and krautrock and were generally considered industrial music, despite the objections of the group.

By 1981, only Stapleton was left from the original trio and he now regards 1982&#x27;s &quot;Homotopy to Marie&quot; as being the first proper Nurse with Wound release. There are now over 40 full length NWW titles. Stapleton&#x27;s fondness for dada, surrealism and absurdist humor are demonstrated in much of NWW&#x27;s output, which, though it draws directly on a wide assortment of genres (including cabaret music, nursery rhymes, John Cage, The Beach Boys, krautrock, ambient music, and easy listening), retains a distinctive and recognizable aura. Musique concrète may be the most prominent touchstone due to Stapleton&#x27;s frequent, and often humorous, use of creative tape loops and editing. This aesthetic is fully represented in the artwork on the album covers, virtually all of which are created by Stapleton, mostly under the pseudonym &quot;Babs Santini&quot;.

==Members==
Although Stapleton has sole curatorship of NWW, the group has a long list of collaborators including Diana Rogerson, James Thirlwell of Foetus, Tony Wakeford, David Jackman of Organum, Andrew McKenzie of The Hafler Trio, Stereolab, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, Christoph Heemann, William Bennett of Whitehouse, Robert Haigh, Rose McDowall of Strawberry Switchblade, Annie Anxiety, John Balance of Coil, Matt Waldron of Irr. App (Ext), and most regularly David Tibet of Current 93. For some time, NWW was a core duo of Stapleton and Colin Potter, the latter having first worked with NWW on 1992&#x27;s &quot;Thunder Perfect Mind&quot; when it was recorded at Potter&#x27;s ICR studio. Potter has appeared on almost every NWW release since 1992. In 2009, a CD titled &quot;Ød Lot&quot; was released (credited to Nurse With Wound) which contained solo recordings by Stapleton, Potter, Waldron and Andrew Liles.

==Current work (2005–present)==
In 2005, the band returned to live performance after a 21-year absence. Stapleton, Potter, Waldron, Rogerson and Andrew Liles played three concerts at the Narrenturm in Vienna, where they performed improvisations on the album &quot;Salt Marie Celeste&quot;. These concerts were not billed as NWW appearances. The first official NWW appearances since 1984 were at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco in June 2006. In December of the same year, the group played at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival organized by Thurston Moore. During 2007, Stapleton gigged and DJed with much greater regularity, including a set at experimental music night Stress!! in Galway City, Ireland and full live NWW sets is in Austria, Belgium, France, Barcelona, London, Moscow, Berlin and Venice.

A collaborative work with krautrock band Faust was released on CD in 2007 as &quot;Disconnected&quot; with a vinyl edition carrying additional mixes following in 2008. Nurse recently joined Faust for the encores during the concert at St. John in Hackney. A NWW album entitled &quot;Huffin&#x27; Rag Blues&quot;, primarily a collaboration with British sound artist Andrew Liles, was issued in 2008 with a companion mini-LP entitled &quot;The Bacteria Magnet&quot;. A remix of Sunn O)))&#x27;s &quot;ØØ Void&quot; entitled &quot;The Iron Soul of Nothing&quot; was given a limited release with an expanded reissue of the out-of-print studio album &quot;The Man with the Woman Face&quot; following. An album of new material entitled &quot;The Surveillance Lounge&quot; was then released as a CD with a limited triple CD called &quot;The Memory Surface&quot;. A CD of new material entitled &quot;Space Music&quot; will be released on 17 November 2009.

A recent collaboration was a result of the chance meeting of Nurse With Wound&#x27;s Steven Stapleton and Graham Bowers, both artists were appearing at Bangor Sound City&#x27;s first art/sound event &#x27;Wet Sounds&#x27; curated by Joel Cahen located at the Bangor Swimming Pool, North Wales, in January 2011. Both were admirers of each other&#x27;s past works and felt that a collaboration on a new piece of work could be an interesting and exciting prospect; consequently &quot;Rupture&quot; was the first full-length work, and was released as a double vinyl album/LP, a CD and download. The vinyl album and CD have been released through Dirter.

They followed up to &quot;Rupture&quot; with &quot;Parade&quot;, which was released on the interdisciplinary arts group/record label Red Wharf and distributed by Cargo. The third collaboration, &quot;ExcitoToxicity&quot;, was released July 2014, and the fourth, &quot;Mutation&quot; released in March 2015 all through Red Wharf and distributed by Cargo.

<text>Pizza Pizza Ltd. is a franchised Canadian pizza quick-service restaurant with its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario. Its restaurants are mainly in the province of Ontario while others are located in Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and western Canada. Franchises in western Canada are mostly run through Alberta-based subsidiary Pizza 73. It has over 500 locations, including over 150 non-traditional locations.

==History==
The chain was founded by Michael Overs, who opened the first location on December 31, 1967, at the corner of Wellesley and Parliament streets in Toronto. He owned the chain until his death in 2010. It expanded throughout the Toronto area in the 1970s, and throughout the rest of Ontario throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

The chain opened its first locations in Quebec in the mid-1980s, but withdrew after a few years. It returned to the province, in Gatineau, in March 2007. Locations were opened in the Montreal area in late 2007 in the boroughs of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Pierrefonds-Roxboro.

Pizza Pizza began to expand significantly outside Ontario during the 2000s. In its 2005 initial public offering filings, the chain announced it would consider expansion in western Canada, potentially including purchasing existing local chains. This led to a June 2007 agreement to purchase Alberta-based Pizza 73. As well, in October 2006, the company announced it would expand in the Quebec market, beginning with sponsorship of the Montreal Canadiens. The chain expanded to the British Columbia Lower Mainland in 2009, however all locations closed (Pizza 73 already had a location in Prince George in the B.C. Interior), and soon after added locations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The chain returned to Vancouver in 2018. Pizza Pizza opened its first store in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in June 2010. The first New Brunswick location, situated in Dieppe, opened late 2021.

Pizza Pizza Limited announced in December 2021 that it was seeking to expand into Mexico.

==Marketing==
Pizza Pizza is known for the chain&#x27;s phone number, XXX–1111. The company claims that its early adoption of the centralized single-number ordering system, and its subsequent use and heavy promotion of this rhyming phone number, helped the chain to expand throughout Ontario.

A central local number is used for all locations until it becomes a long-distance call. In other cities, local numbers are requested with the &quot;11-11&quot; suffix to match the standard jingle in the chain&#x27;s radio advertisements. Pizza Pizza has registered &quot;967–1111&quot; and variants as trademarks.

Unaffiliated American pizza chain Little Caesars does not use its &quot;Pizza! Pizza!&quot; slogan in Canada due to Pizza Pizza&#x27;s slogan registered as a trademark. Instead, Little Caesars uses &quot;Two Pizzas!&quot;, &quot;Hot &#x27;N&#x27; Ready!&quot; or &quot;Delivery! Delivery!&quot;, &quot;Quality! Quality!&quot; and other two-word combinations.

==Trademarks==
Pizza Pizza currently holds the trademarks for:

* Chicken Chicken

==Technology==
Pizza Pizza won a Webby Award in 2011 for Best Mobile Shopping App.

<doc id="382550" wikidata="Q7785065" url="?curid=382550" title="Third jersey">
<text>A third jersey, alternative jersey, third kit, third sweater or alternative uniform is a team jersey or uniform that a sports team can wear instead of its home outfit or its away outfit during games, often when the colors of two competing teams&#x27; other uniforms are too similar to contrast easily.

Alternative jerseys are a lucrative means for professional sports organizations to generate revenue, by sales to fans. Of North American sports leagues, the National Football League generates $1.2 billion annually in jersey sales, with the National Basketball Association second, selling $900 million annually. Another use of the alternative uniform is for identifying with causes, like the Central Coast Mariners wear an alternative pink kit on pink ribbon day.

Extra alternative uniforms or fourth and fifth kits are not commonly used, but are sometimes required when teams&#x27; other uniforms cause color clashes, or the uniforms are unavailable to use. In cases where teams have worn more than three kits in the same season, the extra kits were usually recycled from previous seasons.

Third-choice jerseys or uniforms are used in all five major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.

Third kits are commonplace in professional European association football and in some professional European rugby union clubs. Alternative uniforms are common in Australia&#x27;s two biggest domestic leagues, the Australian Football League (Aussie rules) and National Rugby League (rugby league).

==Background==
As a general rule in most sports, the home team has the privilege to select its desired color first, and the visiting team must then choose a suitable contrasting color. The &quot;third&quot; jersey should be distinct from the &quot;first&quot; (home) and &quot;second&quot; (away) and thus a visiting team should always have at least one suitable alternative choice. The actual choice may be guided by tradition, but modern sports leagues often impose specific rules, especially in professional leagues.

For home and away jerseys in North America, historical convention has often dictated the colors used by teams in a given league. Teams generally have one jersey which is primarily in a team color, and another jersey which is primarily white (or another light color) and accented with a team color. &quot;White at home&quot; is the convention in baseball (MLB), basketball (NBA, NCAA basketball, and WNBA), minor league professional hockey (AHL and ECHL), and college hockey. &quot;White while away&quot; is the convention in football (NFL, CFL, NCAA football), major league professional hockey (NHL), and professional lacrosse (NLL and MLL). Association football (MLS) does not have a &quot;white at home&quot; or a &quot;white while away&quot; convention.

The NHL (and formerly the NBA) enforces the color/white rule strictly; any NHL team seeking to wear white at home must get express permission from the league office to do so. In minor league hockey, the rules are set in both the AHL and ECHL where the team wears white jerseys at home during one half of the season, then wears the color jerseys during the other half at home, and vice versa on the road. In the NFL, the rules state that the home team has the first choice of color, with the visiting team forced to choose a contrasting color; an exception was Color Rush, in which uniform choices were coordinated by the league itself.

Starting with their uniform contract with Nike that begins with the 2017-2018 season, the NBA has abolished the color/white rule. Instead, each team will designate whether their white uniform, now dubbed the &quot;Association Edition,&quot; or their colored uniform, called the &quot;Icon Edition,&quot; will be the home uniform, with the other becoming their designated away uniform.

In American sports, throwback jerseys are generally only used for special team games and not for the &quot;third&quot; purpose. In American football a third jersey may be a throwback uniform based on designs the team used in the past. In association football, meanwhile, it is more commonly a radically different design.

==American football==
===National Football League===
The NFL was the last of the major professional sports leagues to adopt the third jersey rule in 2002, with the only exceptions being the 1994 season, when teams issued a throwback uniform in honour of the league&#x27;s 75th Anniversary. Initially, the NFL rule stated that a team may wear their third jersey only once a year, however, after one year this restriction was increased to two times a year, and then three soon after. Some teams have exceeded the limit; the 2017 Baltimore Ravens were an example, wearing their all-black uniforms twice that season, and the less-frequent black jerseys on white pants once. There are currently no rules on wearing alternative pants. Teams are only permitted to wear alternative jerseys once in playoff games (except the Super Bowl, where teams must wear their standard uniforms); the only team to do so (other than in 1994) was the 2008 San Diego Chargers. In 2021, the Los Angeles Rams were permitted to wear their white alternate uniforms for Super Bowl. In the past, rules allowed for teams to wear their third jersey two times in the regular season and once in the preseason until 2010. In 2011 teams were no longer allowed to wear their third jersey in the preseason. However, there have been some exceptions since 2011. Beginning in 2018, the NFL began allowing teams to wear their alternates three times, and allowed two different alternates to be worn during the season.

Some teams will generally use one of their third jersey allotments against a particular division opponent each year. For instance, the Los Angeles (formerly San Diego) Chargers would frequently wear their popular alternate powder blue jerseys (that was introduced in 2007) at home against the Oakland Raiders, while the Houston Texans were known to wear their alternate &quot;Battle Red&quot; uniforms at home against the Jacksonville Jaguars, and the Pittsburgh Steelers usually wore their throwbacks from 2007 to 2011 at home against the archrival Baltimore Ravens. The New York Giants were known to wear their alternate red jerseys at home against the Dallas Cowboys until the red jerseys were retired in 2009. The Los Angeles Rams have frequently worn their throwback uniform against the San Francisco 49ers in recent years. The Washington Commanders wear their alternative uniform on home games to commemorate their annual homecoming game once a year since 2012.

When wearing their third jerseys, especially if the team is wearing a throwback uniform, the team may theme the field around the uniforms. When the New York Jets, for instance, wore their 1960–1962 &quot;Titans of New York&quot; throwbacks at home, they painted the field in the Titans blue-and-gold color scheme (The Jets&#x27; current color scheme is green and white). In addition, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers dressed the field up in orange when they wore their &quot;Creamsicle&quot; throwbacks in 2009.

Teams will generally wear their third jerseys at home, although clubs may wear them as the visiting team as well. The Carolina Panthers are known to wear their electric blue jerseys on the road (most notably in Tampa) if the home team opts to wear their white jerseys against the Panthers and depending on the circumstance (primarily in warmer weather situations, where home teams will wear white to force the visiting team to have their uniforms absorb heat rather than reflect it). Since introducing a wolf grey alternate in 2012, the Seattle Seahawks have worn their alternates only when on the road. The Denver Broncos wore their alternate navy blue jersey with blue pants in a game against the Dallas Cowboys in 2013, and in 2017 the Los Angeles Chargers also wore their alternate powder blue jersey against the Dallas Cowboys for a Thanksgiving Day matchup despite Dallas wearing navy blue. The New York Jets have worn their Titans throwback uniform once in 2007 against the Miami Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, and in 2017 the Buffalo Bills also wore their white throwback uniform against the Miami Dolphins in a week 17 meeting when Miami was also wearing their throwbacks. The Tennessee Titans, who switched back to navy as the primary color in 2015, wore their alternate Columbia blue jersey with white pants on the road in 2016, 2017, and 2018 when their home opponent forced them to wear their dark colors. The Las Vegas Raiders, who previously wore their white jersey with silver numbers for the color rush promotion from 2016 to 2017, wore the alternates for road games at San Francisco in 2018 and at the Los Angeles Chargers in 2020.

Because the football helmet is such a significant and visible part of the football uniform, some teams also wore alternate helmets when wearing their third jersey. This was particularly true for throwback uniforms, such as those worn by the Cowboys (white), Patriots (white), Steelers (yellow), Jets/Titans (blue), and Buccaneers (white). The NFL outlawed the use of alternate helmets beginning in the 2013 season. This has had impact on some teams wanting to wear their throwback jerseys while other teams are not affected by the limitation. Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie has tried to persuade the league to reverse its one-helmet policy, to allow the Eagles to wear matching kelly green helmets and jerseys. However, beginning in 2022, teams will be allowed to wear an alternate helmet if they so choose.

Outside of league-wide promotions, the only team to not have had an official third uniform as of now are the Kansas City Chiefs.

====Color Rush====

For the 2015 season, the NFL debuted a &quot;Color Rush&quot; jersey concept for select Thursday games (&quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; and one Thanksgiving Day game) in celebration of 50 years of games being broadcast in color. The games featured, mostly, both teams wearing one color matching jerseys, pants, socks and shoes, specially designed to clash with the color of the other team.

The games were as follows:
*November 12: Buffalo Bills (Red) at New York Jets (Kelly Green)
*November 19: Tennessee Titans (Titans Blue) at Jacksonville Jaguars (Bold Gold), 
*November 26: Carolina Panthers (Panthers Blue) at Dallas Cowboys (White, due to superstitions about wearing colored jerseys), 
*December 17: Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Red) at St. Louis Rams (Yellow Gold).

For 2016, all NFL teams had Color Rush uniforms, although nine teams did not wear them on the field during the 2016 season. The 2017 season also featured Color Rush games, but the Redskins (wore all burgundy combo) and Browns did not wear their color rush uniforms. The program as a whole is no longer required prior to the 2018 season; teams have the option of whether or not they want to wear their color rush uniforms for the Thursday night games and can wear them beyond that point.

===College football===
Although uniforms are much less regulated at the collegiate level compared to the NFL, alternate uniforms – and even regular uniform redesigns – are generally less common due to many teams&#x27; respective histories and traditions surrounding a particular jersey color or uniform combination.

Ole Miss was one of the earliest programs to use two different jerseys, wearing the school colors of navy blue and red depending upon the game.

Recently, however, many teams have begun to experiment with alternate uniforms and helmets, especially teams whose uniforms are provided by Nike. Since the late 2000s, Nike has provided the University of Oregon Ducks with modular uniform systems consisting of as many as four color choices for jerseys, pants, helmets, socks and other components, allowing the Ducks to select a new combination for nearly every game.

One of the more famous third jerseys is that of the University of Notre Dame. The team wears either white or navy blue for most games, but occasionally special kelly green jerseys with gold numbers, evocative of the &quot;Fighting Irish&quot;, are chosen for a major contest.

==Association football==

Third kits traditionally started in European competition as a way of marking the occasion and existed in association football at least as early as the 1930s. Until 1989–90, the FA Cup competition rules stated: &quot;Where the colours of the two competing clubs are similar, both clubs must change unless alternative arrangements are mutually agreed by the competing clubs&quot;. Away kits were often similar as well, therefore third kits were worn in the 1948 FA Cup Final by Manchester United and the 1950 final by Arsenal. Similar rules were employed by European governing body UEFA, with Manchester United winning the 1968 European Cup Final in a blue third kit.

Teams sometimes needed to find makeshift third kits for their players. One notable example being France having to wear the green-and-white stripes of local club C.A. Kimberley for their 1978 World Cup match against Hungary, as both teams were only equipped with their white change shirts for the game.

Third kits in international football are less common; both teams are typically advised to change colours in the event of a home kit clashing. England prepared light blue third kits for the 1970 and 1986 World Cups, which were only worn for the former, and Spain introduced a white third kit for the 2014 World Cup at the insistence of FIFA.

Since the 2000s, most clubs in major European leagues have used a third kit, or had one in reserve. Replicas of the kits are usually sold at club merchandise shops. Sometimes, a previous season&#x27;s away kit is retained if a clash arises. Clubs sometimes also assign a third kit as their secondary or even primary kit for certain competitions and vice versa.

One notable incident occurred in 1996, when Manchester United changed into their blue and white third kit – mainly used as their cup away kit – at half-time, with manager Alex Ferguson blaming the grey away shirt for several sub-par performances. Ferguson commented, &quot;The players couldn&#x27;t pick each other out.[...] They said it was difficult to see their team-mates at distance when they lifted their heads&quot;. Newcastle United had to wear its sky blue training kit during a 2022 match against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, because its home kit (black and white), away kit (navy blue) and third kit (white) were all deemed too similar to the blue and white home kit of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

==Baseball==
===Major League Baseball===

After decades of wearing the same uniforms, Major League Baseball teams began to experiment with numerous designs in the early 1970s, ranging from popular designs (such as the Oakland Athletics&#x27; pullover jerseys that most MLB teams later adopted) and not so popular (such as the Chicago White Sox wearing shorts, or the Cleveland Indians wearing all red).

Among such designs that were also tested were third jerseys, to break the traditional mold that baseball teams wear white uniforms at home, and gray on the road. This began in 1972 when the A&#x27;s flamboyant owner, Charles O. Finley, introduced new uniforms to the team. Taking after the lead of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the jerseys were pullover spandex that would later catch on in MLB (though this would be phased out by the early 1990s in favor of the more traditional button-down jerseys), but by going one step further than the Pirates, the A&#x27;s introduced alternate gold and green jerseys. The gold jerseys, lighter in color, were considered &quot;home&quot; alternates while the darker green jerseys were considered &quot;away&quot; alternates.

Soon, many teams caught on with different colored jerseys. The Pirates even went as far as to having a rotation of which jerseys to wear, matching white pinstriped, gold, and black pants to wear with jerseys of the same color. The white pinstripes were later phased out in favor of solid white.

The New York Yankees have generally shunned the practice of third jerseys. The Yankees wore three different jerseys in 1911, 1916, and most recently in 1943 according to the Dressed to the Nines database maintained by the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In recent years, the Yankees have worn throwback uniforms for single games in 1996 and 2012. The Detroit Tigers also do not have a third jersey, but on May 7, 1995, the team wore an alternate navy jersey with a tiger stepping through a white old english &quot;D&quot; as their logo. It was the only time that team wore a third jersey. Third jerseys otherwise remain popular in baseball today, either as an alternate design or as a throwback known as &quot;Turn Back the Clock Night.&quot; The Milwaukee Brewers, for example, have worn a variation of their 1978–1993 home uniforms for every Friday home game. In 1999, the Seattle Mariners hosted the Kansas City Royals for a game where both teams wore &quot;futuristic&quot; uniforms meant to represent the year 2027 (what will be the Mariners 50th season). The &quot;Turn Ahead The Clock&quot; promotion was so successful that it was copied the next year by 20 MLB teams, this time representing the year 2021 (due to sponsorship by the real estate company Century 21); however, the jerseys were roundly ridiculed and have not been seen since.

The Toronto Blue Jays change from their traditional blue and grey jersey to a red alternate jersey every Canada Day (July 1) to help celebrate the national holiday (and with it, a cap with a red maple leaf on it, which is Canada&#x27;s national symbol). In 2007, the Jays announced that as part of the team&#x27;s popular &quot;Flashback Friday&quot; promotion, the team would use replica uniforms based on the powder-blue road uniforms used in the 1980s at all Friday night home games, starting with the 2008 season. To complete the look, the Jays also wore the original blue and white caps, with their traditional logo on the front of the uniform as well as on the caps. In 2017, to celebrate Canada&#x27;s 150th anniversary, the Blue Jays wore alternate red jerseys and caps for every Sunday home game. The Tampa Bay Rays wore a black alternate from 1998 to 2000 when they were the Devil Rays, and from 2005 to 2007 they wore green alternate jersey worn both at home and away on selected games. When they changed their name to the Rays, they introduced an alternate navy blue for home and away games to go along with their white and gray uniforms. In 2010 they added light blue jerseys to be worn only on Sunday home games. The Cincinnati Reds wear a red alternate at many afternoon home games, and the Atlanta Braves wear a red jersey for every home game played on Sunday, while the Washington Nationals wear red for all weekend home games, and in 2011 have done so for most weekend road games as well. The Pittsburgh Pirates wore a red alternate for every home game played on Friday during the 2007 season, even though red is not an official team color. Since , the Boston Red Sox wore a red alternate jersey for Friday night home games and a blue alternate jersey for Friday night away games. Also since 2008, for every afternoon home game, the Kansas City Royals wear powder-blue jerseys almost reminiscent of the old jerseys they wore in the 1980s (and in 2010 introduced new powder-blue caps to be worn with these jerseys, though they have since gone back to wearing their normal blue caps). The San Francisco Giants wear orange jerseys during all Friday home games. The Philadelphia Phillies introduced an alternate cream-colored uniform (with a blue cap to complete the look) in 2008 and currently wear it for all afternoon home games. Most recently the Mariners revived their teal jerseys from the mid-1990s, to be used on Friday home games. The Seattle Mariners also have a navy blue alternate away jersey. In 2015 they also introduced an alternate version of their home uniforms, using the team&#x27;s classic blue-and-yellow scheme on cream uniforms, to be worn on Sunday home games. The Baltimore Orioles wear alternate black jerseys (with a cap showing the &quot;O&#x27;s&quot; script logo) every Friday, regardless of whether they are home or away (home games against the Red Sox would force the latter to wear their regular grey uniforms rather than their navy Friday uniforms), and in 2012 they introduced an alternate orange jersey to be worn during Saturday games. 
In 2013, the New York Mets introduced two different blue alternate jerseys; one has their team name on it (in orange lettering) and is used at home, while the other has their city name on it (in gray lettering) and is used on the road. Prior to that, the Mets wore two black alternate jerseys in a similar fashion as their current blue alternates.

To honor the U.S. military, during Sunday home games, the San Diego Padres originally sported special camouflage-colored jerseys (with green caps to match); in 2011 the camouflage jerseys were changed to a brown/tan &quot;desert camo&quot; with a tan cap. Then in 2016, the Padres replaced them with a new &quot;navy camo&quot; jersey (honoring the U.S. Navy) with a blue cap. Also, they released a modernized version of the franchise&#x27;s classic brown jerseys with brown-and-yellow caps (which was originally worn from 1969 to 1984) to be worn for Friday home games.

In contrast, the Chicago Cubs frequently wear a blue alternate jersey on the road, and not according to the day of the week. This jersey is worn based on the decision of the starting pitcher (particularly when Carlos Zambrano was scheduled to start), thus explaining why it is worn more often than other third jerseys.

After the death of Harmon Killebrew in 2011, the Minnesota Twins decided to wear their cream-colored &quot;throwback&quot; third jersey – a direct replica of the uniforms used for most of Killebrew&#x27;s career – for every home game for the rest of the year.

The Milwaukee Brewers have two alternate uniforms with the same color, with one featuring the team nickname and used on home games, the other featuring the city name and used on away games; in addition to their regular alternates, since 2011 the Brewers have, during various &quot;Heritage&quot; games, worn uniforms with &quot;Cerveceros&quot; (&quot;Brewers&quot; in Spanish), &quot;&quot;Bierbrauer&quot; (German), &quot;Birrai&quot; (Italian) and &quot;Piwowarzy&quot; (Polish); their opponents during those games would usually also have the foreign translation of their own team name on their road uniforms, such as &quot;Piraten&quot;&quot; (&quot;Pirates&quot; in German) or &quot;Cardenales&quot; (&quot;Cardinals&quot; in Spanish).

More recently, there is also a trend towards alternate grey uniforms. The San Francisco Giants wear a different version of their road grey uniforms, featuring the interlocking &quot;SF&quot; instead of the city name in full. This design is similar to the road uniforms the team utilized in the late 80&#x27;s. The Dodgers and the Cubs have followed suit in wearing alternate grey uniforms, sporting the team name in front (rather than the city name) for their grey alternates.

All 30 MLB teams wore special colored jerseys with contrasting sleeves on the weekend of August 25–27, 2017, for Players Weekend. The Cardinals and Pirates also used these jerseys on August 20, when they met in the MLB Little League Game in Williamsport, Pennsylvania; both this game and Players Weekend coincided with the 2017 Little League World Series in South Williamsport. Notably, the 2017 Players Weekend marked the first time the Yankees ever placed names on the back of their jerseys. Players Weekend has since become an annual affair, with similar jersey changes for each subsequent event.

The trend toward multiple uniforms of the same color can also lead to on-field mix-ups: in 2011, Brewers pitcher Zack Greinke, making a pinch-hitting appearance, accidentally wore the &quot;&quot;Bierbrauer&quot; jersey the night before German Heritage Day, while in 2014, just three games into the first season where the alternate was introduced, outfielder Junior Lake played the first inning in a &quot;Chicago&quot; jersey while the rest of the team wore &quot;Cubs&quot;&quot;.

In 2023, Major League Baseball limited teams to two alternate uniforms in addition to a home and road uniform and a City Connect uniform; this is known as the &quot;4+1 rule&quot;. While some teams complied with the rule, including teams such as the Seattle Mariners and Tampa Bay Rays replacing their gray road uniforms with colored tops, MLB allowed the San Diego Padres to keep their two Sunday camouflage home uniforms in order to maintain their tradition of honoring the United States Armed Forces. In addition to the two aforementioned uniforms, the Padres also wear brown tops with sand pants as an alternate road uniform.

Through the 2023 MLB season, the Mariners and Padres have the most alternate jerseys with four. It includes the City Connect jerseys. Diamondbacks, Braves, Orioles, Red Sox, White Sox, Astros, Royals, Marlins, Brewers, Phillies, Pirates, Giants, Rays, Rangers, and Nationals have three. The Cubs, Reds, Guardians, Rockies, Angels, Dodgers, Twins, Mets, Cardinals, and Blue Jays have two. The Athletics have one and the Tigers and Yankees have none.

==== City Connect ====

In 2021, Nike and Major League Baseball introduced the City Connect series, in which teams unveil alternate uniforms that were a reflection of their community. In a break from recent trends of wearing only colored alternate tops whilst pairing them with either gray or white pants, some designs began incorporating similarly colored pants for the occasion, giving a full-color treatment from shoulders to feet. As of 2024, 28 of 30 MLB teams have City Connect uniform. The New York Yankees and Oakland Athletics are the only two teams without a City Connect uniform.

==Basketball==
===National Basketball Association===
The concept of the third jersey in the NBA was first introduced when the Atlanta Hawks wore neon green alternate jerseys in addition to their standard blue road and white home jerseys during the and seasons. However, it was not until the mid-1990s that third jerseys became a common trend throughout the league.

The season brought the first wave of third jerseys in the NBA, as the Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Detroit Pistons, Orlando Magic, Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings released new alternate uniforms. The trend continued in the season with the Chicago Bulls, Miami Heat, Milwaukee Bucks and New York Knicks introducing their own third jerseys.

Since then, third jerseys became a regular part of every NBA team&#x27;s uniform rotation, but at first, not all teams were receptive with the concept. For instance, the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers initially refused to join the trend out of respect to tradition, but they eventually unveiled new alternates in the and seasons respectively.

The third jersey trend only got stronger when the NBA signed exclusive uniform contracts with Reebok and later Adidas. The Adidas deal, in particular, saw the introduction of additional alternate uniforms in an effort to boost jersey sales; examples include the Golden State Warriors&#x27; sleeved alternates and the Heat&#x27;s monochrome uniforms.

In addition to third jerseys, there are also holiday-themed jerseys that are worn only on special occasions. These include the jerseys worn on Christmas Day, Chinese New Year, Mardi Gras (for the New Orleans Pelicans), and Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day.

Other alternate uniforms in the NBA include the &quot;Noche Latina&quot; uniforms, military-inspired uniforms, and &quot;Pride&quot; uniforms, all of which were also concepts introduced by Adidas.

NBA teams were only allowed to introduce a new third jersey at least two years after unveiling a new logo and uniform set. This rule has since been relaxed somewhat, following more recent third jersey releases by the Utah Jazz, the Brooklyn Nets, the New Orleans Pelicans, the New York Knicks, the Philadelphia 76ers, the Phoenix Suns the Charlotte Hornets and the Atlanta Hawks, in which some of the teams release their alternates on the same day as their regular home and away set.

Teams are also allowed to wear their third jerseys as often as desired during the first three rounds of the NBA Playoffs and the NBA Finals. Per the NBA Rule Book, there is no official rule that states that teams are restricted on wearing alternate uniforms or white at home during the NBA Finals. They only requirement stated is from Section VI, c. which states, &quot;The home team shall wear light color jerseys, and the visitors dark jerseys unless otherwise approved. For neutral court games and doubleheaders, the second team named in the official schedule shall be regarded as the home team and shall wear the light colored jerseys.&quot; An example of this was when the Cleveland Cavaliers won the 2016 NBA Finals in a black sleeved alternate jersey.

This rule concerning uniform designations was eliminated once Nike became the uniform provider for the NBA in 2017. In doing so, teams now have the freedom to choose whichever uniform they want to wear, whether it&#x27;s the &quot;Association&quot; white jersey (formerly the de facto home jersey), the &quot;Icon&quot; dark jersey (formerly the de facto away jersey), the &quot;Statement&quot; alternate color jersey (formerly the de facto third jersey) and the annual &quot;City&quot; and &quot;Earned&quot; jerseys.

==Canadian football==

The Canadian Football League first introduced the use of a permanent third jersey on September 6, 1994, when the Calgary Stampeders wore black uniforms for the Labour Day Classic against the Edmonton Eskimos. The CFL did not have a rule for use of alternate uniforms and teams were able to wear them as often or as little as they liked, a rule that is still in effect. Teams are also able to wear multiple alternate jerseys within the same season, as seen with the Montreal Alouettes during their 2009 campaign when they wore alternate black, blue, and throwback jerseys, in addition to their regular home and away uniforms. Teams are also permitted to wear their third jerseys as the away team, provided that they do not clash with the home team&#x27;s uniforms. Despite teams having no restrictions with third jerseys, only the Stampeders chose to wear them during the 1990s, presumably due to the league&#x27;s financial struggles during this decade. As such, no CFL USA team ever wore an alternate uniform. The Alouettes were the next team to introduce third uniforms in 2001 when they also wore black uniforms; a colour that was not part of the team&#x27;s colour scheme. The Saskatchewan Roughriders first wore their black alternates in 2002 as it became more normal for teams to wear these jerseys. The BC Lions wore orange retro uniforms twice during the 2003 season as part of the celebrations for their 50th season, but those were only worn for that season.

In the 2005 CFL season, Reebok redesigned the primary home and away uniforms for all nine teams and also introduced new alternate uniforms for six teams, with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts abstaining and the Saskatchewan Roughriders keeping their alternates that they had been using since 2002. Calgary introduced the third iteration of their black uniforms while the Alouettes wore a blue jersey with red numerals. The BC Lions, having now converted to orange as the primary jersey colour, wore black alternates, the Edmonton Eskimos and Winnipeg Blue Bombers wore their own versions of gold alternates, and the Ottawa Renegades wore red alternate jerseys.

For 2006, the Tiger-Cats introduced gold alternate jerseys on August 12, 2006, in a game against the Argonauts. This season also saw the first case of both teams wearing alternate uniforms as the Alouettes brought back their black uniforms in a home game against the Eskimos who wore their gold jerseys. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers also wore their alternate gold jerseys as the away team for their playoff game against the host Toronto Argonauts. The Toronto Argonauts were the last CFL team to wear a third jersey as they wore alternate Cambridge blue uniforms on July 26, 2007.

The league recognized the history of its teams by having member clubs wear throwback uniforms beginning with the 2008 CFL season with the Toronto Argonauts and Winnipeg Blue Bombers wearing 1950s-style uniforms for two games featuring both teams. The CFL then had all eight current teams wear 1960s-based uniforms for the 2009 CFL season and 1970s-based uniforms for the 2010 CFL season. These differed from the designated third jerseys in that most were for one season only, except for the Saskatchewan Roughriders white retro jersey and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers royal blue retro jersey that were worn in subsequent seasons. These throwback uniforms were worn to lead up to the 100th Grey Cup celebration.

Following the league-based retro initiative, the league then turned its attention to a modernized take on all nine teams (including the expansion Ottawa Redblacks) by introducing Signature uniforms mostly in the 2014 season. The Lions first wore their Signature uniforms in 2013 as part of their 60th season celebrations with the other eight teams following suit the following season. The uniforms were worn twice by each team except for Ottawa who wore theirs three times and Winnipeg who wore theirs once. In 2015, Winnipeg abandoned the uniforms altogether, as did the BC Lions, despite their popularity in BC. Every other team wore theirs twice during 2015 except for Hamilton, who wore theirs once on Labour Day.

With the league-wide redesign of uniforms by Adidas in 2016, Calgary, Edmonton, and Montreal each retained their signature series uniforms and each wore them twice during the regular season (Calgary also wore theirs in the West Final game). Saskatchewan also wore a modified version of their retro-themed uniforms in two games that year. When New Era became the league outfitter in 2019, only Calgary, Edmonton, and Saskatchewan wore third jerseys and all three were holdovers from the previous three seasons. Ottawa introduced new alternates in 2021 and four teams wore new alternates in 2022.

As of 2018, teams are permitted to wear third jerseys during the playoffs, but not for the Grey Cup game. The 2010 Saskatchewan Roughriders were the last team to wear alternate uniforms for the championship game.

The following list is a recount of all known alternate uniforms worn by member clubs as of the 2024 CFL season and does not include one-time throwback uniforms:

* BC Lions – Introduced a black alternate uniform in 2005 loosely based on the 1960s jersey, initially worn with white helmets. Switched to orange helmets with black uniform from 2006 to 2008, including the 2006 West final and 94th Grey Cup win. Worn with black retro helmets in 2009 and 2010 seasons. Retired the jerseys in 2011 wearing white helmets, in the final game at Empire Field. Introduced gunmetal uniforms, first worn on August 17, 2013, and worn twice during the 2013 and 2014 seasons, including an away game in Toronto on August 17, 2014. The Lions did not wear a third jersey again until October 15, 2022, when the team wore a modified version of the gunmetal uniforms. The team also wore these uniforms for their playoff game in 2022. The Lions wore a new uniform set in 2023, but did not wear a third jersey that year. In 2024, the Lions introduced a third iteration of the gunmetal uniforms with new logos which were worn twice in the regular season.
* Calgary Stampeders – First to wear third uniforms when they introduced black alternates with red numerals in 1994 on September 6 against Edmonton. They were the first team to wear alternates during a playoff game and the first to wear alternates during a Grey Cup game, which they did in the 86th Grey Cup in 1998. Those black jerseys were retired following the Grey Cup win and new black alternates with white numerals were unveiled in 1999 that were worn until 2004. They first wore black pants with the black jerseys on October 18, 2002 at home vs. the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The third version of black uniforms were worn on Labour Day in 2005 and were last worn on September 2, 2013. 2011 was the first time the Stampeders wore black helmets with the black uniforms. The Signature series uniforms were first worn, also on Labour Day, for the 2014 season and again from 2015 to 2021. They were also worn for home playoff games from 2015 to 2018. The team introduced new black uniforms in 2022 which were first worn for the Labour Day game that year and once more in the final home game in 2022, which was repeated in 2023. Since 1994, the Stampeders have worn black on Labour Day 20 times.
* Edmonton Elks – First wore their gold alternate jersey on September 9, 2005, against the Calgary Stampeders. Wore the gold alternates against the Alouettes in 2006 as the away team as the Alouettes also wore their alternate uniforms. The club last wore these jerseys on September 7, 2007, again against the Stampeders. The club had no third jersey after the retirement of the gold jersey until the 2014 season when they wore their Signature series green uniforms with the gold &quot;EE&quot; logo. This uniform had been worn at least once each season until the uniforms were rebranded in 2022 where no alternate uniforms were worn that year. In 2024, the Elks introduced green alternate uniforms with green numerals that were worn with gold helmets and green pants, which were worn three times that year.
* Hamilton Tiger-Cats – Introduced a gold alternate jersey on August 12, 2006 against the Toronto Argonauts. The jerseys were always paired with black helmets and black pants. They were worn three times during the 2007 and 2008 seasons and worn for the last time on October 31, 2009 and just once for the 2009 season as the team wore retro jerseys that same year. The team had no alternate jersey until the Signature series grey uniform was unveiled in 2014. The grey uniform was worn three times between 2014 and 2015 and no alternate uniform was worn from 2016 to 2021. The team introduced new steel grey uniforms in 2022 which were worn twice that year and twice again in 2023 and 2024, including once on the road in both seasons.

* Montreal Alouettes – Began wearing an all-black uniform in 2001 and continued wearing them until 2004 and two more times in 2006. Introduced a blue alternate with red numerals in 2005 and wore these jerseys in the 93rd Grey Cup. The blue alternates were worn again in 2006, 2009 and 2010. The team introduced a new black jersey, this time with grey numerals as opposed to blue, for the 2007 and wore this jersey five times during the regular season while wearing the primary home jersey four times. This jersey was worn until the 2010 season and was brought back one more time for the 2013 season. The team wore dark grey and blue Signature series uniforms for the 2014 season and wore them two times in each subsequent season until 2016. The uniforms were worn just once in 2017 and 2018 and when the Alouettes re-branded in 2019, the team did not wear a third jersey. The Alouettes had planned to introduce a fan-designed third jersey for the 2021 season as part of their 75th anniversary celebrations, but this did not occur following a cancelled 2020 CFL season. Instead, this uniform was revealed in 2023 and was worn three times during the regular season and once in the post-season, including twice for away games, but just once in 2024.
* Ottawa Rough Riders – Never wore a third jersey.
* Ottawa Renegades – Introduced a red alternate jersey worn with white pants on July 1, 2005 against the Montreal Alouettes. Worn four times for the 2005 season including a game where they wore the jerseys with black pants on September 16, 2005 against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. 
* Ottawa Redblacks – As part of the Signature series, the Redblacks wore red and plaid uniforms three times during the 2014 season, including an away game on November 7 against the Toronto Argonauts. They wore them twice again in 2015. The team did not wear alternate uniforms again until 2021 when they introduced new red alternate uniforms which were worn three times during the season. The red uniforms were worn twice during the 2022 season and three times in 2023 and 2024.
* Saskatchewan Roughriders – First wore a black uniform with green numerals during the 2002 season. The jersey was always worn with black pants and was last worn in 2006. The team introduced retro-themed green alternate jerseys worn with silver pants in 2007, based on the uniforms first worn in 1967. From 2010 to 2012, these jerseys were worn with white pants. Also in 2010, white retro versions of these jerseys were introduced, but contrary to most CFL teams, the Roughriders continued to wear these until the 2012 season for select away games. In 2013, the green retro jersey was worn with green pants. In 2014, the team remodeled the retro green jersey, this time more resembling the uniforms from the early 1980s. Also in 2014, the team wore their Signature series uniforms twice, while also wearing &quot;blitz green&quot; for the first time. Both the retro uniform and the Signature series uniforms were worn twice during 2015. The team introduced a modified version of their retro uniform in 2016 that did not have shoulder numbers and it has been worn at least twice each season since then, except for 2021 and 2022 when it was only worn for the Labour Day Classic. In addition to the retro uniforms, the Roughriders introduced obsidian alternate uniforms in 2024 which featured a dark shade of green from helmets to socks and were worn three times, including for their home playoff game.
* Toronto Argonauts – Were the last franchise to introduce a recurring alternate jersey, which they did in 2007 on July 26 against the Montreal Alouettes. The jersey was Cambridge blue and partnered with their Oxford blue pants and was worn once in 2007, 2008 and 2009. With the retro uniforms that were introduced in 2009, the team also paired the retro Cambridge blue pants with the alternate jerseys for a monochrome Cambridge blue look that the team wore twice that year. The team wore an Oxford blue retro jersey in 2010 that made a return appearance in 2011. The team became the first in the CFL to wear a white alternate uniform that wasn&#x27;t based on a retro uniform when they wore their Signature series jerseys in 2014. This uniform was worn once at home and once away in both 2014 and 2015. No alternate jersey has been worn since 2016.
* Winnipeg Blue Bombers – Wore gold alternate jerseys as part of their 75th anniversary season in 2005. The jerseys were worn with either white pants or blue pants and were worn every season through to 2010. Additionally, for the three seasons that the Blue Bombers qualified for the playoffs, the gold jerseys were worn for each game, both home and away, and in the 95th Grey Cup. Also in 2010, the club wore retro 1970s era royal blue jerseys, which were then adopted as the alternates for 2011 and 2012. A modified 1980s era royal blue jersey was introduced in 2013 and was also worn in 2014. The Blue Bombers only wore their 2014 Signature series uniforms once, whereas all other teams wore theirs at least twice, possibly due to negative fan reception. The team did not wear an alternate uniform until 2022 when they introduced all-blue uniforms with a white &quot;W&quot; on the front. These uniforms were worn twice in 2022 and 2023, including in the Banjo Bowl both years, but just once in 2024.

==Ice hockey==
===National Hockey League===

In the National Hockey League, each team has its own distinctive sweater design (hockey tradition usually refers to jerseys as &quot;sweaters,&quot; because hockey players actually wore sweaters on the ice until the 1960s). Prior to 1995 (save a few isolated instances), each team only had two sweaters – one for home use, and one for the road. One sweater was dominantly white (or in a few instances, a light colour), and the other dominantly a dark colour. The home team has first choice of uniforms from the 1917–18 to the 1969–70 seasons (the white or yellow sweater was predominantly the road sweater with the dark sweater predominantly being the home sweater). In the 1970–1971 season, the NHL required teams to wear white (or yellow) sweaters at home and dark sweaters on the road; this rule remained in place until the end of the 2002–03 season. When the Third Sweater Program was introduced in the 1995–96 season, some teams wore the third sweater at home, which would have required an opponent to carry two sets of equipment and uniforms with them while on the road under most circumstances. This was alleviated starting in the 2003–04 season, when new rules mandated dark sweaters at home and white sweaters on the road, with yellow now being treated as a dark colour.
The first NHL team to feature a three-sweater rotation was the Boston Bruins. From 1955 through 1967, the Bruins had a gold home sweater and a white road sweater, and for several of those seasons featured a black third sweater. The Pittsburgh Penguins would later introduce a gold third sweater in 1981, worn occasionally at home for two seasons for Sunday games and exclusively at home only in the 1983–84 season before retiring it. As part of the NHL&#x27;s 75th anniversary in the 1991–92 season, for select games the Original Six teams wore throwback sweaters based on designs the teams wore at some point during the first 50 years of the league. The Chicago Blackhawks and Detroit Red Wings wore their throwbacks again for a game at Chicago Stadium in the 1993–94 season.

The 1995-96 third sweater program provided an opportunity for CCM to further experiment with dye-sublimation printing on their sweaters. CCM had introduced the process to the NHL with the 1994 All-Star Game sweaters and the Calgary Flames&#x27; new uniforms introduced in the 1994–95 season. The sublimated dye process allows for more complex stripe and graphic designs than were possible or practical with traditional manufacturing methods. The initial participating teams in the 1995–96 season embraced the concept, although the results were mixed. The Bruins&#x27; gold jersey, featuring a brown bear&#x27;s head on the front and jagged striping, lasted through the 2005–06 season, while the Penguins&#x27; third jersey, featuring gradient striping that complemented their logo at the time, replaced their road jerseys in 1997. The Vancouver Canucks&#x27; red and black jersey with gradient striping, a subtle nod to their garish &quot;Flying V&quot; jerseys from 1978 to 1985, were retired in 1997 when the team changed colours and logos altogether. The jerseys worn by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Los Angeles Kings only lasted one season. Due to the backlash against the less popular designs, the sublimation process was used by fewer teams in subsequent seasons, as newer thirds either rearranged the colours of an existing jersey, or experimented with different construction methods to create new designs.

With the advent of the 2003 Heritage Classic outdoor game, the NHL introduced the Vintage jersey program, allowing a select number of teams to wear throwback designs for a limited number of games, in addition to their existing uniforms. These uniforms were designated with a special V-logo patch. Seven teams participated in the program, and included both home and road versions of throwback designs. As a result, the Bruins, Kings, Canucks, and New York Rangers each had an unprecedented five jerseys in their rotation for that season. The program was suspended due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, although the Vancouver Canucks and Montreal Canadiens would wear their vintage jerseys for a few games each in the 2005–06 season, and the Canucks and Bruins would wear their dark throwbacks as third jerseys (replacing sublimated-print third jerseys) in the 2006–07 season. The Canucks&#x27; and Bruins&#x27; throwbacks would later serve as the inspiration for their RBK Edge uniform redesigns in 2007.

Following a one-year hiatus on all third jerseys (save for the 2008 NHL Winter Classic, where the Pittsburgh Penguins and Buffalo Sabres wore throwbacks for that game) as part of the NHL&#x27;s transition to the Edge uniform system, the third jersey program returned in full earnest for the 2008–09 season. The Winter and Heritage Classics became showcases for throwback uniforms and new sweaters with a throwback aesthetic, while the NHL Stadium Series became a showcase for more radical uniform designs. Third jerseys as a whole began to skew more to traditional stylings and throwback designs, especially for teams who more modernized looks in the Edge redesign. Another trend has been for teams to include an off-white cream colour, sometimes referred to as &quot;vintage white&quot; or &quot;antique white&quot;, in place of pure white on their third or Classic jersey, attempting to replicate the discoloured appearance of a genuine aged sweater. This trend picked up after the Minnesota Wild began extensively using &quot;Minnesota wheat&quot;, an official team colour similar to the vintage cream colour, in place of white trim on their dark jerseys.

The only teams that have not had a full-season third jersey since the beginning of the current program are the Detroit Red Wings and the Montreal Canadiens. However, both teams have participated in at least one outdoor game and had special jerseys for each event. In addition, the Canadiens wore five different vintage jerseys over the course of their centennial celebration in the 2008–09 and 2009-10 seasons, in addition to their earlier participation in the Vintage jersey program.

Prior to 2021, the New Jersey Devils have eschewed the concept of third jerseys under general manager Lou Lamoriello. Instead, they wore special one-off alternates that were throwbacks of the classic red and green jerseys for one home game on or around St. Patrick&#x27;s Day every season since 2009–10, with the exception of the lockout-shortened 2013 season, and have also worn them in their 2014 NHL Stadium Series outdoor game. However, in 2021, the Devils finally unveiled their first full-time third jersey, using black as the base color.

With Reebok being replaced by parent company Adidas as the NHL&#x27;s uniform supplier for the 2017–18 NHL season, the third jersey program once again went on hiatus for one year. Like what happened during the Reebok transition, alternate jerseys returned for the 2018–19 season.

====Usage====

Once a team has been granted permission by the league to use their new design, they will request and be allowed ten to fifteen games during the season in which they may use their third sweater. They may continue to use the third sweater in subsequent years as well. This alternate design allowed the team&#x27;s appearance to flirt with radical designs which have occasionally gone on to become the new looks for some of the participating teams, though they can also be quite garish. An infamous example is the aforementioned St.Louis Blues&#x27; planned third sweater from 1996. The Mighty Ducks&#x27; third from that season, featuring mascot Wildwing bursting through a sheet of ice, was also considered particularly garish. Sales of third sweaters to fans have also provided significant additional income for cash-strapped NHL teams. For example, in 2013, the Calgary Flames introduced a third sweater in exactly the same colours as their primary home sweater, but with the addition of &quot;western styling&quot; mixed with traditional hockey sweater features such as laces and the team name in script on the front. This doesn&#x27;t always work; in the case of the Flames, they reverted to their throwback third jersey in the 2016–17 season.

Teams are also allowed to wear their third jerseys as often as desired in the Stanley Cup Playoffs; however, they may only wear two different uniforms during the playoffs (one at home and one on the road). Examples of teams who wore third jerseys in the playoffs include the Dallas Stars (in 1999), the San Jose Sharks (from 2011 to 2014), the Anaheim Ducks (in 2014), the Minnesota Wild (from 2013 to 2017), the Washington Capitals (in 2015), the Toronto Maple Leafs (in 1999), the Philadelphia Flyers (in 2001 and 2009), the Pittsburgh Penguins (in 1997, 2016, and 2021), the Edmonton Oilers (in 2017 and 2021), the Calgary Flames (in 2019), the Arizona Coyotes (in 2020) and the Carolina Hurricanes (in 2019, 2020, and 2021). The Ducks, Stars, Flyers, Penguins, Oilers, Wild, Flames, and Coyotes are also examples of teams wearing third jerseys in the playoffs that are then promoted to full-time jerseys the following season.

====Chronology====
Several teams have had multiple designs of their third jersey.

*1955–56: &quot;Boston Bruins&quot; (remained until end of 1956–57 season; brought back for 1959–60 season and stayed until end of 1964–65 season)
*1966–67: &quot;Toronto Maple Leafs&quot; (inspired by Canada&#x27;s Centennial celebrations in 1967, the Leafs had a completely different uniform set for that year&#x27;s Stanley Cup playoffs, which culminated with a Stanley Cup victory. The modified Leafs uniform featured a new Maple Leaf emblem, replacing the traditional maple leaf with a design imitating the leaf found on Canada&#x27;s new Maple Leaf Flag introduced in 1965. This uniform was adopted by the team the following season (1967–68) and remained until a completely new uniform design was unveiled for the 1970–71 season.)
*1981–82: &quot;Pittsburgh Penguins&quot; (remained until 1984–1985 season)
*1991–92: &quot;Boston Bruins&quot;, &quot;Chicago Blackhawks&quot;, &quot;Detroit Red Wings&quot;, &quot;Montreal Canadiens&quot;, &quot;New York Rangers&quot;, &quot;Toronto Maple Leafs&quot; (all as throwback/vintage jerseys)
*1993–94: &quot;Chicago Blackhawks&quot; and &quot;Detroit Red Wings&quot; (one game, wearing the 1992 throwback/vintage jerseys)

*2006–07: &quot;Boston Bruins&quot; (1960s throwback), &quot;Buffalo Sabres&quot; 
*2007–08: No teams were allowed to have alternate jerseys due to the introduction of the Reebok Edge jersey style. During the NHL playoffs, the &quot;Toronto Maple Leafs&quot; announced they would wear jerseys similar in design to the ones worn during their 1967 Stanley Cup run, but this did not occur because the Maple Leafs failed to reach a playoff spot during the regular season. The &quot;Pittsburgh Penguins&quot; (1968–76 blue throwback) and the &quot;Buffalo Sabres&quot; (1970–96 white throwback) were therefore the only two teams to wear their third jerseys, which happened in the Winter Classic.
*2008–09: On September 10, 2008, the Carolina Hurricanes unveiled a new predominantly black third jersey featuring a flag design reminiscent of the maritime advisory flag system. The following teams announced the use of third jerseys for the 2008–09 NHL season: &quot;Atlanta Thrashers&quot;, &quot;Boston Bruins&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Sabres&quot;, &quot;Chicago Blackhawks&quot; (a vintage jersey for the 2009 NHL Winter Classic at Wrigley Field), &quot;Dallas Stars&quot;, &quot;Detroit Red Wings&quot; (for the 2009 Winter Classic), &quot;Edmonton Oilers&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Kings&quot;, &quot;New York Islanders&quot;, &quot;Ottawa Senators&quot;, &quot;Philadelphia Flyers&quot;, &quot;Phoenix Coyotes&quot;, &quot;Pittsburgh Penguins&quot;, &quot;San Jose Sharks&quot;, &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;, &quot;Tampa Bay Lightning&quot;, &quot;Toronto Maple Leafs&quot;, &quot;Vancouver Canucks&quot;. To commemorate its 100th season, Montreal Canadiens wear vintage jerseys from seasons 1912–13, 1915–16 and 1945–46 during selected home games against Original Six teams.
*2009–10: Montreal Canadiens announce in Fall 2008 they will wear vintage jerseys from seasons 1909–10 and 1910–11 during selected home games against Original Six teams to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the team. In addition, the Bruins and Flyers donned vintage jerseys for their game as part of the 2010 NHL Winter Classic at Fenway Park on January 1, and the Flyers then changed to the Winter Classic white sweater as their away jersey for the 2010–11 season; new third jerseys in the 2009–10 NHL season were worn by the Calgary Flames, Colorado Avalanche, Florida Panthers, Minnesota Wild and the Nashville Predators. The Blackhawks also debuted a new third jersey which is a variation of the Winter Classic jersey used in 2009.
*2010–11: The Buffalo Sabres and the New York Islanders are officially changing to the third as their home (and a new white road uniform based on same) for the 2010–11 season. Buffalo introduced a new third jersey loosely based on their AHL predecessor, the Buffalo Bisons, to celebrate the team&#x27;s 40th anniversary. The Columbus Blue Jackets have introduced a new third jersey, wearing it on selective home and away games only. The Anaheim Ducks also introduced a new third jersey as well along with their home and away jerseys. The Los Angeles Kings unveiled a new fourth throwback jersey, which is based on their purple and gold jerseys worn from 1967 to 1979. The Pittsburgh Penguins retired their powder blue alternates and unveiled their new third jersey at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic at Heinz Field. On November 12, 2010, the New York Rangers introduced a new heritage jersey in a celebration of their 85th anniversary, which is worn during home games against Original Six teams and on all Sunday (later Saturday) home games. The Rangers&#x27; heritage jersey debuted on November 17 in a game against the Bruins. The Anaheim Ducks introduced a third sweater on November 26. The jersey features the &quot;D&quot; duck foot logo on the front and the colours are primarily black and orange. On the shoulder of the jersey, there is a patch of the Mighty Duck logo which was no longer used in the 2006–07 NHL season with the logo the Ducks are currently using.
*2011–12: The Los Angeles Kings relegated their purple and black road jerseys as alternates, while assigning the black and silver jerseys to regular use at home. They made a white and black away jersey based on this design. The Ottawa Senators replaced their black &quot;SENS&quot; alternates with a retro barberpole design based on the original Senators jerseys. The Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals promoted their 2011 Winter Classic jerseys to third jersey status, while the Toronto Maple Leafs unveiled a new blue retro alternate based on the jersey worn when they won the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals. Even though the Tampa Bay Lightning unveiled new logos and uniforms, their alternate &quot;BOLTS&quot; uniform was retained. The New York Islanders added a black jersey as their alternate, which was retired towards the end of the 2013–14 season.
*2012–13: No third jerseys were unveiled in the lockout-shortened season, but the Buffalo Sabres, Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers dropped their third jerseys.
*2013–14: The Buffalo Sabres unveiled their two-tone third jersey, with the front of the jersey in gold and the back of the jersey in navy. The Calgary Flames replaced their classic 1980s third jerseys (which are now worn once per season) with a red and black jersey featuring a throwback &#x27;Calgary&#x27; script and modern design features (it would be replaced with the former jerseys after the 2015–16 season). The Carolina Hurricanes retained their black third jerseys despite unveiling a new uniform set, while the third jerseys of the Los Angeles Kings and Pittsburgh Penguins were dropped.
*2014–15: The Anaheim Ducks promoted their third jerseys to regular use at home, adding a new white uniform based on the same design. The Pittsburgh Penguins unveiled their new black and gold third jersey, which is based on their road uniforms worn from 1980 to 1992. In addition, the Philadelphia Flyers promoted the jersey they wore at the 2012 Winter Classic to alternate status. After retiring their black third jersey towards the end of the 2013–14 season, the New York Islanders added a blue alternate jersey, which was previously worn at the Stadium Series game at Yankee Stadium in the previous season. The Tampa Bay Lightning changed their third jersey to a black alternate, while the Los Angeles Kings and Arizona Coyotes unveiled new throwback jerseys, the latter replacing their black third jersey.
*2015–16: The Anaheim Ducks introduced a new orange third jersey. The Edmonton Oilers introduced a new throwback alternate orange jersey, while the Vancouver Canucks added a black throwback jersey that was the team&#x27;s road uniform from 1989 to 1997. The Washington Capitals added a red alternate jersey based on the white alternate jersey they used from the 2011–12 to the 2014–15 seasons. In addition, the Colorado Avalanche and the New York Islanders changed their alternate jerseys. The two-tone third jersey worn by the Buffalo Sabres was permanently discontinued; in its place, a &quot;third jersey&quot; identical to the white away jersey was used for six home games (technically it &quot;was&quot; the same jersey, but as previously noted it required special dispensation from the league to allow it).
*2016–17: The Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; third jersey that was worn during the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons was promoted to regular use at home; while the Boston Bruins replaced their third jersey with the jersey that was first worn at the 2016 NHL Winter Classic. The Los Angeles Kings and Philadelphia Flyers introduced special third jerseys, while the St. Louis Blues removed their third jerseys.
*2017–18: No teams were allowed to have regular alternate jerseys due to the introduction of the Adidas jersey style. However, teams participating in outdoor games (the NHL 100 Classic, Winter Classic, and Stadium Series games) had special uniforms for those games. In addition, the Toronto Maple Leafs wore a Toronto Arenas throwback for the Next Century Game, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the first game in NHL history.
*2018–19: The following teams announced the use of third jerseys for the 2018–19: the Anaheim Ducks, the Arizona Coyotes, the Calgary Flames, the Carolina Hurricanes, the Colorado Avalanche, the Columbus Blue Jackets, the Edmonton Oilers, the New Jersey Devils, the New York Islanders, the Ottawa Senators, the Philadelphia Flyers, the Pittsburgh Penguins, the San Jose Sharks, the St. Louis Blues, the Washington Capitals and the Winnipeg Jets. The Boston Bruins and Chicago Blackhawks wore throwback jerseys during the 2019 NHL Winter Classic. The Carolina Hurricanes announced that they would wear green Hartford Whalers jerseys for select games against the Boston Bruins during the 2018–19 season.
*2019–20: The Boston Bruins, the Edmonton Oilers, and the Vancouver Canucks added new third jerseys. Special throwback uniform designs were worn by the Buffalo Sabres, the Calgary Flames, the Dallas Stars, the Los Angeles Kings, the Nashville Predators, and the Winnipeg Jets for a few games during the season.
*2020–21: NHL began partnering with Adidas to introduce the &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; program, where all 31 teams are issued special uniforms which are based on throwback jerseys that were worn during previous seasons. Several teams, including the Arizona Coyotes, the Boston Bruins, the Carolina Hurricanes, the Columbus Blue Jackets, the Los Angeles Kings, the Minnesota Wild, the Montreal Canadiens, the New Jersey Devils, the San Jose Sharks, and the St. Louis Blues, received uniforms that swapped the colour palettes. The introduction of the &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; jerseys marks the first time in history that all 31 teams have at least three jerseys. In addition to the introduction of the &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; series, the Dallas Stars, the Vegas Golden Knights, and the Washington Capitals introduced new fourth jerseys, while the throwback uniform of the Calgary Flames was promoted to a home uniform and the old home uniform was relegated to a fourth jersey; the third jerseys of the Buffalo Sabres and the Ottawa Senators were redesigned into &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; jerseys as part of those teams introducing new wholesale uniform sets.
*2021–22: New third jerseys were unveiled for the Los Angeles Kings, New Jersey Devils, Pittsburgh Penguins, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Winnipeg Jets. In addition, the Arizona Coyotes&#x27; previous &quot;coyote head&quot; home jersey was relegated to a third jersey.
*2022–23: A second set of &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; jerseys were introduced. The Buffalo Sabres, Calgary Flames, Carolina Hurricanes, and Vancouver Canucks unveiled modernized versions of 1990s-era throwback jerseys, while the Arizona Coyotes unveiled a new red alternate jersey.
*2023–24: The Anaheim Ducks and Boston Bruins wore anniversary-specific third jerseys for the season. The Minnesota Wild brought back their Minnesota North Stars-inspired green and gold &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; jersey as an alternate, and the New York Rangers, San Jose Sharks and Tampa Bay Lightning unveiled new alternate jerseys.

==Rugby league==
===National Rugby League===
In recent years the third jersey has appeared in the Australian NRL, with every team having a &#x27;home&#x27; jersey, an &#x27;away&#x27; jersey and a &#x27;heritage&#x27; jersey. The NRL does not currently require third or alternate jerseys, because most clashes can be resolved with away jerseys or using modified under-20s jerseys.

*South Sydney Rabbitohs used a white jersey (the under-20s away jersey) against Canberra in 2008, even though the NRL stated that the Souths and Canberra jerseys don&#x27;t clash. They have a similar jersey for 2009 which contains tribal Aboriginal and Maori designs.
*Parramatta Eels have adopted a home (yellow with blue designs), away (blue with yellow designs, however in 2007 this was the alternate) and alternate (white with yellow designs, however in 2007 was away) jersey scheme. They (along with Manly-Warringah and Illawarra) were one of the pioneers of away jerseys in rugby league in Australia.
*Canterbury Bulldogs use a jersey reminiscent of their training jersey as a clash strip (also their under-20s away jersey). They also wear their Berries strip from the 1960s as a heritage strip and a similar (yet quite different) jersey (white with blue and black butcher stripes) for trials.
*Brisbane Broncos have been known to wear a blue and aqua alternate jersey, however, it is rare to see as blue has become a colour hated by Queensland rugby league fans.
*Wests Tigers have worn a white version of their 2008 home jersey, switching the white/orange areas, and introduced a &quot;10 Year Anniversary&quot; jersey, which is white with black and orange V&#x27;s. They also wear modernised versions of the old Balmain Tigers and Western Suburbs Magpies strips from the 1980s.
*Though not technically third jumpers, the Centenary of Rugby League celebrations left all teams with special jerseys for the Centenary round, and in 2009 several teams wore the same jerseys (the Newcastle Knights, however, wore their foundation strip, in 2008 they wore a Newcastle Rebels jersey, which was the first Newcastle team in the NSWRL and played in the NSWRL&#x27;s foundation season. The New Zealand Warriors wore a jersey symbolising the history of rugby league in Auckland, with a dark blue jersey with 2 white V&#x27;s, while the Melbourne Storm wore their 2000&#x27;s light purple with white lightning bolts away strip in the 2009 Heritage Round, while in 2008 they wore their foundation jersey with V&#x27;s).
*As a result of the above point, the Sydney Roosters have used five jerseys in 2008.

<text>Mount Hope Cemetery is a municipal cemetery in Rochester, New York, United States. Founded in 1838, it is the burial site of Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass. Situated on of land adjacent to the University of Rochester on Mount Hope Avenue, the cemetery is the permanent resting place of over 350,000 people. The annual growth rate of this cemetery is 500–600 burials per year.

The cemetery hosts the sculpture &quot;Defenders of the Flag&quot;, a Civil War monument made in 1908 by the American sculptor Sally James Farnham. In 2018 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Geology of Mount Hope ==
About 12,000 to 14,000 years ago, Mount Hope was covered with ice one to two miles thick. As the glacier receded, cracks appeared in the ice, and these crevasses became rivers of water and gravel. When the miles-high ice sheets finally melted, these river beds were left as ridges created from all the rock and rubble that had been deposited by the flowing river. In geological terms, these ridges are called eskers. One such esker snakes its way through much of Mount Hope Cemetery.

== Notable structures and events ==


Mount Hope Cemetery was once the site of &quot;The Fandango Tower.&quot; This was a wooden structure, sitting atop the highest elevation of the cemetery, acting as an observation tower. This offered visitors grand views of the city, as well as the meandering Genesee River. The Fandango was involved in the &quot;Great Rochester Mirage&quot; of April 1871. Visitors to the tower noted on the morning of April 16, 1871, that views of the Canadian banks of Lake Ontario could be seen from the tower in great detail, as if replacing those of Rochester. These views of Canada&#x27;s lake shores, over 50 miles away, were indeed visible from The Fandango Tower, due to an atmospheric phenomena known as Fata Morgana. The Fandango Tower is no more, however the ruined foundations can still be found in one of the deep kettles of the cemetery to this day.

The architectural styles of the cemetery&#x27;s gravestone and grave markers, crypts, chapels, gatehouses, and mausoleums span three centuries. Distinct motifs of the High Victorian Gothic and Neoclassical architectural traditions persist throughout the cemetery and its various structures. Tiffany glass windows may be found in several of the mausoleums.

The cemetery contains two non-denominational chapels which the Friends group refers to by their construction dates: the 1862 Chapel and the 1912 Chapel. Neither has been used for decades and are closed to the public due to their structural deterioration although in 2020 a local contractor completed masonry stabilitzation work on the 1912 chapel.

The cemetery is home to several working water features. Sylvan Waters, a water feature constructed within a naturally forming kettle pond, was remodeled and brought back into use during the Fall-Winter season of 2016 and 2017.

In June 2000, American Civil War General Elisha Marshall&#x27;s crypt was desecrated and vandalized, resulting in his remains being scattered throughout the surrounding area. Marshall&#x27;s bodily remains were gathered and reinterred, however, the whereabouts of the skull remains a mystery. The perpetrators were never apprehended or identified.

For years it has been a tradition during elections for people, mostly women, to place &quot;I Voted&quot; stickers on the gravestone of Women&#x27;s rights activist, Susan B. Anthony. In 2016, 10,000 people were estimated to visit the gravesite during the notable election of having the first woman, Hillary Clinton, running for president on a major party ticket. The headstone was damaged by the residue left by the stickers. As a result, in anticipation of visitors for the 2020 election, Friends of Mount Hope Cemetery placed a clear Plexiglass sleeve to protect the site from further damage.

General Elwell Stephen Otis was originally interred at Mount Hope before being removed to Arlington National Cemetery. Notable cremations at Mount Hope include Blanche Stuart Scott and George Eastman.

Elizabeth Mackenzie, mother of Upper Canada Rebellion leader and first Mayor of Toronto, William Lyon MacKenzie, is interred here following her death in exile in 1839 and listed as Elizabeth Kenzie. Her son viewed her passing funeral from his cell at Monroe County Jail in December 1839 after failing to be granted leave to be at her deathbed. The Mackenzie family remained in the United States before returning to Canada in 1849.

== Friends of Mount Hope ==
The Friends of Mount Hope Cemetery is a non-profit organization of volunteers founded in 1980 to restore, preserve, and encourage public use and enjoyment of this unique historical treasure.

<doc id="382557" wikidata="Q5310807" url="?curid=382557" title="Dublin 4">
<text>Dublin 4, also rendered as D4 and D04, is a historic postal district of Dublin, Ireland including Baggot Street Upper, the southernmost fringes of the Dublin Docklands, and the suburbs of Ballsbridge, Donnybrook, Irishtown, Merrion, Ringsend (including South Lotts and parts of Grand Canal Dock) and Sandymount, on the Southside of Dublin. Most of the area was known as Pembroke until 1930 when it was absorbed by the City of Dublin.

The headquarters of the national broadcaster RTÉ, the RDS, Merrion Centre, University College Dublin, Aviva Stadium, Google and a number of foreign embassies to Ireland are all located in Dublin 4.

It is Ireland&#x27;s most expensive postcode. At the height of the Celtic Tiger economic boom, Shrewsbury Road in D4 was the sixth most expensive street in the world, with one property on the street selling for €58 million. As of 2022, the average property price in the district was almost €1 million.

==Popular culture==
Dublin 4 or its abbreviation, D4, is sometimes used as a pejorative adjective to describe Dublin&#x27;s upper-middle class based on the perceived characteristics of residents of this area. However, it sometimes also used to refer to the Irish upper middle class in general, regardless of whether or not they live in the D4 area. In this sense the term signifies a set of attitudes said to be in opposition to those held by &quot;the plain people of Ireland&quot; by Irish commentators such as Desmond Fennell.

While the area has, for most of its existence, been seen as well-to-do, the use of the term D4 as an adjective emerged in the 1990s. The fictional jock Ross O&#x27;Carroll-Kelly was meant as a caricature of this.

The term has been used to describe the aspirational upper middle-class from south Dublin and also used by Fianna Fáil members who like to portray themselves as being on the side of &quot;the plain people of Ireland&quot;.

Maeve Binchy&#x27;s book, &quot;Dublin 4&quot;, contains a series of short stories set in the area.

===Accent===
A change in accent occurred between those born roughly before 1970 and those born in the early 1970s or later.

In the early 1980s, a group of people in Dublin 4 developed a different accent, partly in rejection of older views of Irishness. This form of Dublin accent was known as &quot;Dublin 4&quot;, &quot;Dartspeak&quot; or later &quot;DORTspeak/Formers Morket&quot; (after the Dublin 4 pronunciation of DART, which runs through the area). It has also been noticed that people who move into the area and parts of south Dublin from outside the county and who would normally speak in their native accent develop the DORT accent as well. The accent quickly became the subject of ridicule.

==Quotes==
Two examples of &quot;Dublin 4&quot; being used to refer to alleged wealth:


Sometimes the antonym &quot;plain people of Ireland&quot; or &quot;plain people&quot; was contrasted with it:
== Usage in Dublin addresses ==
Colloquially, Dubliners refer to the area as &quot;Dublin 4&quot; or &quot;D4&quot;. The postal district forms the first part of numerous seven digit Eircodes that are unique to every single address in the area. For addressing purposes, it appears in both its original form as Dublin 4 and as the first part of a seven digit postal code as D04 a line below. For example:  
 The Embassy of Switzerland
 6 Ailesbury Road
 Dublin 4
 D04 W205

<doc id="382560" wikidata="Q5254564" url="?curid=382560" title="Delta Air Lines Flight 1141">
<text>Delta Air Lines Flight 1141 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight between Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Texas, and Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah. On August 31, 1988, the flight, using a Boeing 727-200 series aircraft, crashed during takeoff at DFW, resulting in 14 deaths and 76 injuries among the 108 on board. The cause of the crash was that the crew failed to configure the airplane&#x27;s flaps or slats for takeoff. The aircraft&#x27;s take-off warning system (TOWS) also malfunctioned and failed to warn the crew of the problem. Recordings from the cockpit voice recorder revealed that the crew had improperly engaged in casual conversation on various matters unrelated to the operation of the flight, which may have distracted them from properly performing their duties. The recordings, which were broadcast repeatedly by the press, proved so embarrassing that a law was subsequently passed to prohibit the release of cockpit voice recordings. Since the passage of that law, only written transcripts have been released rather than the voice recordings themselves.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft was a Boeing 727-232 Advanced, MSN 20750, registered as &quot;&quot;, a three-engine narrow-body jet aircraft. It was delivered to Delta Air Lines in November 1973, and was the 992nd Boeing 727 to be manufactured. The aircraft had logged around 43,023 airframe hours and was powered by three Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-15 turbofan engines.

== Crew ==
The flight crew consisted of Captain Larry Lon Davis (48), First Officer Carey Wilson Kirkland (37); and Flight Engineer Steven Mark Judd (30). Captain Davis was a highly experienced pilot, with a total of approximately 17,000 flight hours, 7,000 of which had been in the 727. First Officer Kirkland had a total of 6,500 flight hours, with 4,500 hours in the 727. Flight Engineer Judd had a total of 3,000 flight hours, including 600 hours in the 727.

The cabin crew consisted of four flight attendants: Dixie Dunn (56); Diana George (40); Rosilyn Marr (43); and Mary O&#x27;Neill (57).

==Accident==
Flight 1141 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight from Jackson Municipal Airport in Jackson, Mississippi, to Salt Lake City International Airport in Salt Lake City, Utah, with an intermediate stop at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) in North Texas. The Wednesday morning flight from Jackson to DFW was uneventful, and Flight 1141 arrived at DFW at 07:38 CDT. For the flight from DFW to Salt Lake City, Flight 1141 had 101 passengers and seven crew members on board.

At 08:30, Flight 1141 departed from the gate at DFW and was cleared by the ground controller to taxi to runway 18L. The aircraft was instructed to line up on the runway and hold for one minute due to the possibility of wake turbulence from an American Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-10 that was departing. The crew requested to extend the hold to two minutes, which was granted. The crew talked to the flight attendants for a while about what they would say on the cockpit recorder in case they crashed. Eventually this chat ceased as the crew was cleared for takeoff. The takeoff was normal until the main wheels left the ground, at which point the aircraft commenced a violent rolling motion and the right wing dropped. The aircraft&#x27;s tail made contact with the runway briefly, and later, the right wingtip struck the runway. The aircraft developed compressor surges (due to breakdown of the airflow through the engine), and was unable to gain altitude or maintain stabilized flight. Approximately beyond the end of runway 18L, the plane&#x27;s right wing hit the ILS localizer antenna, which set the wing on fire and caused it to start disintegrating while the plane was still in flight. The aircraft remained airborne for another before it struck the ground, sliding sideways and leaving a trail of wreckage long before finally coming to a rest from the end of the runway. Fire erupted in the right wing area and quickly spread and engulfed the rear of the aircraft. The total flight time was 22 seconds, from liftoff to the first ground impact.

==Casualties==
Two of the four flight attendants (Dunn and Marr) and 12 of the 101 passengers on board died in the accident. Medical examinations determined that all but one of the fatalities were due to smoke inhalation. One passenger, who had successfully exited the aircraft, attempted to re-enter the aircraft in order to assist his wife and other passengers still trapped inside; he suffered severe burns and died 11 days after the accident from his injuries.

Captain Davis, First Officer Kirkland, two cabin crew members, and 22 passengers were seriously injured. Flight Engineer Judd and 49 passengers received minor injuries; 18 passengers received no injuries. Many of the passengers reported that impact forces were not severe and mostly concentrated towards the back of the aircraft. Captain Davis suffered severe fractures to the rib cage and spine that required surgery. First Officer Kirkland was badly bruised and sustained a concussion. Flight Engineer Judd sustained injuries to his abdomen.

==Investigation==
===Aircraft performance===
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the accident attempted to reconstruct the aircraft&#x27;s performance based on reports from witnesses and survivors. Witnesses reported that the plane attempted to climb at a higher than normal angle, and that the plane rolled from side to side and appeared to be out of control. Based on examination of the wreckage, the NTSB determined that collision with the instrument landing system (ILS) localizer antenna array approximately beyond the departure end of the runway 18L led to the breakup of the aircraft. Leaking jet fuel started a fire that quickly engulfed the fuselage. Engine #3 had separated from the empennage. Passengers reported that the plane appeared to shake violently on takeoff. Witnesses on the ground claimed that one of the engines was on fire, but although the engine was badly crushed from ground impact, there was no sign of fire or heat damage. Delta officials quickly reacted to questions about the 727&#x27;s operating and maintenance condition by pointing out that the original factory engines from 1973 (when the plane was initially purchased by the airline) had been replaced in the last few years by a newer model that ran more quietly and used less fuel. They also stated that there were no known mechanical or maintenance problems with the plane prior to the flight.

The NTSB examined why the plane was unable to climb once it departed the runway. After conducting airplane performance studies, the NTSB determined that the events of Flight 1141 could only be explained by the aircraft attempting to take off without its flaps and slats extended to the proper take-off configuration. The aircraft&#x27;s instability and sudden roll to the right was consistent with known performance of the Boeing 727 with the flaps and slats retracted. The captain continued to pull back on the control column in an attempt to keep the plane&#x27;s nose raised, which created turbulence over the rear-mounted engines and caused the compressor surges. However, the NTSB concluded that the compressor surges would not have significantly reduced the engines&#x27; thrust, and that the plane&#x27;s failure to gain speed was due to aerodynamic drag on the aircraft due to the high angle of attack, rather than a loss of engine thrust. The NTSB found that the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recorded the captain and first officer announcing the deployment of the flaps but the sound of flap lever movement is never heard. Based on the aircraft&#x27;s failure to climb at takeoff speed, its roll instability, the position of the flap&#x27;s jackscrews in the fully retracted position, and the absence of sounds indicating the flaps or slats were deployed, the NTSB determined that the plane&#x27;s failure to climb resulted from the flight crew&#x27;s failure to deploy the flaps and slats as required by the preflight checklist.

Based on the lack of warning sounds on the CVR, the NTSB also determined that the plane&#x27;s take-off warning system (TOWS), designed to alert the crew if the engines are throttled to take-off power without the flaps and slats being correctly set, failed to alert the pilots to their improper takeoff configuration. The switch that operated the TOWS in the incident aircraft had been previously modified, per Boeing instructions, to prevent nuisance activations during aircraft taxiing. A fleet-wide Boeing 727 inspection, ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration following the Flight 1141 crash, identified 35 anomalies in the TOWS out of 1,190 aircraft examined. The FAA had recommended that the Boeing 727 TOWS be changed from a system activated by the aircraft throttles to one activated by engine pressure ratio (EPR), and while Delta owned Boeing 727s that had an EPR-activated TOWS, these were all aircraft that Delta had acquired from other airlines, and Delta did not convert its own aircraft to an EPR-activated system. The NTSB concluded that the TOWS had not activated because it had an intermittent problem that was not detected or corrected during the aircraft&#x27;s last maintenance action.

===Crew and airline performance===
The NTSB investigated the relationship between crew performance and the events in the accident. FAA regulations require a sterile cockpit before takeoff, which prohibits conversation unrelated to the aircraft and the pending flight. However, the CVR recorded the flight crew and a flight attendant talking about the CVR itself, the crash of Continental Airlines Flight 1713, the dating habits of the flight attendants – which First Officer Kirkland grimly and forebodingly joked to Dunn how &quot;in case we [Flight 1141] crash, then the media would have some kind of juicy tidbit&quot; – in addition to the upcoming presidential election, drink mixes, and various other topics. Of the flight crew, the first officer was most actively engaged in these nonessential conversations, with the captain only occasionally joining in. Although the captain did not consistently participate, he also failed to stop the first officer&#x27;s repeated interruptions and chatter with the flight attendant. The NTSB determined that, if the captain had taken a more active role in managing the cockpit, the accident might have been prevented.

Shortly after an NTSB hearing in which the CVR transcripts were discussed, all three members of the flight crew were fired from Delta. However, the airline itself was also faulted. The NTSB determined that Delta did not insist on standardized crew cockpit management, and that flight crews were allowed significant latitude in their conduct. This lax corporate philosophy contributed to the poor discipline and performance of Flight 1141&#x27;s flight crew. The NTSB also found that the FAA was already aware of deficiencies in Delta&#x27;s operations regarding flight crew performance and behavior, and said that neither Delta nor the FAA had taken sufficient corrective action to address the problems.

===Probable cause and dissent===
On September 26, 1989, the NTSB published its final accident report. In it, the NTSB ultimately determined that there were two probable causes for the accident: (1) inadequate cockpit discipline that resulted in the flight crew&#x27;s failure to extend the aircraft&#x27;s flaps and slats to proper take-off configuration, and (2) the failure of the plane&#x27;s TOWS to sound and alert the crew that their plane was not properly configured for takeoff. Contributing to the accident was Delta&#x27;s slow implementation of changes to its flight crew management programs, a lack of sufficiently aggressive FAA action to compel Delta to correct known deficiencies, and a lack of sufficient accountability within the FAA&#x27;s air carrier inspection process.

One member of the safety board, Jim Burnett, dissented from the NTSB&#x27;s probable cause statement. While Burnett concurred with the accident report&#x27;s facts and findings, he believed that the actions of the FAA and Delta were direct causes of the accident and not merely contributing factors. Burnett&#x27;s dissent proposed a probable cause statement that included the two probable causes named in the main report, while adding a third probable cause:

==Aftermath==
Although the NTSB specifically faulted the captain and first officer for the accident, and did not fault Judd (the flight engineer), Judd was unable to find work as a commercial pilot after being fired from Delta. A former Navy pilot, Judd worked as a reserve pilot at Naval Air Station Dallas while appealing against his firing, and was later reinstated by Delta.

Media broadcast of the CVR tapes, which demonstrated why the crew failed to extend the airplane&#x27;s flaps or slats for takeoff, provoked such an outcry by pilots that subsequent releases of CVR data have been restricted by law and carefully vetted by the NTSB. The law prohibits the NTSB from generally releasing CVR transcripts or recordings; while an exception permits the NTSB to release transcripts related to a safety investigation, there is no exception permitting the NTSB to release copies of the actual recordings.

==Dramatization==
The accident was featured in the third episode of season 18 of &quot;Mayday&quot;, titled &quot;Deadly Distraction&quot;.

<text>Matt Wagner (born October 9, 1961) is an American comics artist and writer who is best known as the creator of the series &quot;Mage&quot; and &quot;Grendel&quot;.

==Career==
Matt Wagner&#x27;s first published comic book work was &quot;Comico Primer&quot; #2 (1982), which was the first appearance of Grendel. In addition to his creator-owned series &quot;Mage&quot; and &quot;Grendel&quot;, he has worked on comics featuring the Demon and Batman as well as such titles as &quot;Sandman Mystery Theatre&quot;. In 1991, he illustrated part of the &quot;Season of Mists&quot; story arc in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; series. He wrote and drew &quot;Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity&quot; a limited series featuring DC&#x27;s three major heroes in 2003. He followed it with &quot;Batman and the Monster Men&quot; and &quot;Batman and the Mad Monk&quot; in 2006.

His other projects include &quot;Madame Xanadu&quot; for Vertigo, with artist Amy Reeder Hadley. He has produced numerous comics covers, including painted ones for &quot;Green Arrow&quot; and has written several &quot;Green Hornet&quot; limited series for Dynamite Entertainment.

Outside comics, Wagner provided art for the 1984 &quot;Villains &amp; Vigilantes&quot; adventure &quot;Battle Above the Earth&quot; written by Steven Crow.

In April 2022, Wagner was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA&#x27;s benefit anthology book, &quot;Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds&quot;, a project spearheaded by IDW Publishing Special Projects Editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Wagner produced a new Grendel story featuring Hunter Rose for the anthology.

<doc id="382562" wikidata="Q1260205" url="?curid=382562" title="Ancient murrelet">
<text>The ancient murrelet () is a bird in the auk family. The English term &quot;murrelet&quot; is a diminutive of &quot;murre&quot;, a word of uncertain origins, but which may imitate the call of the common guillemot. Ancient murrelets are called &quot;ancient&quot; because they have grey on the back like a shawl, as worn by the elderly.

==Taxonomy==
The ancient murrelet was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the auks in the genus &quot;Alca&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Alca antiqua&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;ancient auk&quot; that had been described in 1785 by both the English ornithologist John Latham and the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant. Both authors mention a specimen in the Leverian Museum and give the location as the west of North America, the Kuril Islands and the Kamchatka Peninsula. The ancient murrelet is now one of five species placed in the genus &quot;Synthliboramphus&quot; that was introduced in 1837 by the German born naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt. The genus name combines Ancient Greek &quot;sunthlibō&quot; meaning &quot;to compress&quot; with &quot;rhamphos&quot; meaning &quot;bill&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;antiquus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;ancient&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
*&quot;S. a. antiquus&quot; – northeast Asia, Aleutian Islands to western Canada
*&quot;S. a. microrhynchos&quot; – – Commander Islands (eastern Russia)

== Description ==
This small auk species is black on the head, throat and rear neck, grey-backed, and has white underparts. The yellow bill is short and stubby. It has a small rounded black tail. The summer adults have white head streaks giving an aged look and leading to the English name. Other plumages are similar, but lack the crown streaks and black on the throat.

Ancient murrelets tend to bank from side to side in flight to a greater extent than other small auks. They fly with fast wing beats due to their short wings.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds from the Yellow Sea (islands off China), through the Russian Pacific coast and the Aleutian Islands to the Haida Gwaii archipelago of British Columbia, where about half of the world population breeds.

Some ancient murrelets migrate from Canada to winter near Japan and China, even though the climate is similar at the two ends. It is the only bird known to cross the whole North Pacific. They then start a return trip in February, flying four or five hours a day. Genetic evidence shows that the species originated in Asia and only recently colonized North America, so their migration takes them back to their original homeland. In 2007, surveys off the Olympic Peninsula found unprecedented numbers of Ancient Murrelets with chicks, strongly implying local breeding.

Other ancient murrelets however fly south in winter as far as California, and odd birds are found inland in North America, carried by autumn storms. The most remarkable record of this relatively short-distance Pacific migrant was a bird found on the island of Lundy, in Devon, England in the spring of 1990. Even more remarkably, what was presumably the same bird returned to this British island for the next two springs as well. In 2021 murrelets were sighted in Finland.

==Behavior==

===Diet and feeding===
Like other auks, ancient murrelets forage by swimming underwater using their wings for propulsion. Their diet is poorly known. In winter it consists mainly of crustacea, while in summer both small fish and crustaceans are taken. Based on stable isotope analysis, their diet in Haida Gwaii seems to consist primarily of small mesopelagic fish.

===Breeding===

Ancient murrelets nest in colonies on islands in the north Pacific, mainly off the coast of North America, but also near Japan and Kamchatka. One of its largest colonies is on Frederick Island in British Columbia. They lay two eggs (sometimes one) in burrows excavated in forest soil among tree roots, under logs or in grass tussocks, occasionally in rock crevices. They arrive at and depart from their nesting grounds at night, presumably to reduce predation, and perhaps for the same reason the young are never fed at the nest, being taken to sea 1–3 days after hatching. The parents and young recognise one another by call and after the chicks have run from the burrow to the sea, they locate their parents by call and the entire family swims immediately out to sea. The family continues to move away from land, usually at night, and will travel a long distance, typically up to , for at least twelve hours. After that, the young are fed exclusively at sea by their parents for more than a month. This species spends less time on land than any other bird.

==Status and conservation==
The ancient murrelet is listed as of &#x27;Special Concern&#x27; by the committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada because populations have been greatly reduced over the past century by mammalian predators such as rats introduced to their breeding islands by visiting ships in the 1800s. On one island, the number of breeding pairs was reduced from 200,000 pre-infestation to about 14,000 in the 21st century.

In 2009, a five-year $2.5m Night Birds Returning project was instituted by Parks Canada, Haida Nation, Island Conservation and Coastal Conservation to restore Murrelet population by eradicating rats in the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site. For success, every single rat needs to be killed as a single pregnant rat can repopulate an island in 1–2 years. In 2011, ground-based eradication was implemented on Arichika and Bischoff islands. Phase 2 consisted of using aerial drops of poisoned pellets selectively attractive to rats. This was conducted in fall of 2013 on Murchison and Faraday islands. Continued monitoring is required for two years before an area can be declared rat-free.

<text>In the Federal Republic of Germany, the  or &quot;Shop Closing Law&quot; (abbreviated: LadSchlG) is the federal &quot;blue law&quot; compelling retail stores to close to the public on Sundays and Christian holidays. The in its current form was first enacted on 28 November 1956 following pressure from Germany&#x27;s trade unions; in its last revision (of 2 June 2003), points of sale &quot;(Verkaufsstellen)&quot; must be closed at any of the following times:

# On Sundays and public holidays;
# On working days (Monday through Saturday) before 06:00 and after 20:00;
# On 24 December before 06:00 and after 14:00 if that date falls on a working day

The law provides differing regulations for pharmacies, petrol stations, shops at train stations and airports, etc. 

On 30 June 2006, as part of the &quot;Föderalismusreform&quot; (&quot;Federalism Reform&quot;), the regulatory responsibility for this area was devolved to the German states. Although the Federal law technically remains in force, this change means states are free to determine the opening hours of retail stores in their areas. All states – with the exception of the more conservative Bavaria – have made use of that option.

==German states with varying shop opening hours==
The states have each adopted individual regulations concerning opening hours on Sundays and public holidays. Some continue to observe the existing Federal rules, while others have liberalized them somewhat, although the general Federal ban concerning opening on Sundays and holidays remains in effect, owing to a provision in the German constitution recognizing Sunday as a day of rest and a corresponding decision of the Federal Constitutional Court &quot;(Bundesverfassungsgericht)&quot; on 9 June 2004.

===States With 24/6 Schedule===

<doc id="382568" wikidata="Q3569875" url="?curid=382568" title="Woolco">
<text>Woolco was an American-based discount retail chain. It was founded in 1962 in Columbus, Ohio, by the F. W. Woolworth Company. It was a full-line discount department store unlike the five-and-dime Woolworth stores which operated at the time. At its peak, Woolco had hundreds of stores in the US, as well as in Canada and the United Kingdom. While the American stores were closed in 1983, the chain remained active in Canada until it was sold in 1994 to rival Walmart, which was looking to enter the Canadian market. All of the former UK Woolco stores were sold by Kingfisher, which had bought the UK Woolworth business, to Gateway which subsequently sold them to Asda.

==History==
===Creation===
The creation of Woolco coincided with the expansion of suburbia. Woolworth&#x27;s flagship stores were still doing well, but the company wanted to tap into the growing discount department store market without diluting its dominant position in the variety store business. The first Woolco store was located in Columbus, Ohio and opened on June 6, 1962. By 1966, there were 18 in the United States and nine in Canada. Plans were for 30 stores to be added per year. This led to tremendous growth as over 300 Woolco stores opened up across North America by the mid-1970s. Some stores were converted from regular Woolworth stores, including the location at Westland Mall in West Burlington, Iowa.

The company experimented with both Woolco and a more downscale merchandising unit called Worth Mart in the mid-1960s. Woolco was the eventual winner with customers, and the Worth Mart stores were folded into Woolco&#x27;s store base by the 1970s.

At the outset, Woolco stores were considered by the company to be &quot;promotional department stores,&quot; with expanded product lines and other amenities not typically found at namesake Woolworth stores.

Many locations contained Red Grille restaurants, a cafeteria-style outlet, and the food areas sold popcorn, real milkshakes, and other food.

A number of Woolco stores were opened in the United Kingdom during the same period. One of which opened in Bournemouth on 29 October 1968; in 1970, it was the largest store on one floor in Britain, with an area of 114,000 square feet and parking space for 1,250 cars.

In November 1971, four new stores were opened simultaneously across Canada (including at Marlborough Mall) bringing the total in that country to 47.

=== Demise ===
The typical Woolco store was well over , which was quite large for a discount store of that era. Many of its departments (e.g., shoes and jewelry) were leased to third-party operators, a common practice among early discounters.

Starting in the late 1970s, Woolworth enacted a cost-saving plan for Woolco that included a reduction in floor space for the largest locations, the elimination of most leased departments and an expansion into smaller markets with stores as small as . During this period, the excess space in some larger Woolco stores went to Woolworth-owned J. Brannam.

J. Brannam, short for &quot;Just Brand Names&quot;, was an off-price clothing retailer owned by F.W. Woolworth. Plans for the chain were first made public via a press release in July 1979, which stated the chain would open its first locations in the Oklahoma City and Dallas metro markets, in which there would be three and five locations in each area respectively. All eight of these prototype J. Brannam locations opened on October 24, 1979. Rapid expansion began; by its peak in 1982, the chain had stores as far west as Arizona and as far east as North Carolina. This expansion soon proved too strenuous for the chain, and all locations were shuttered by December 1985, citing &quot;increased competition in discount retailing&quot;.

By 1979, it became clear that the earlier cost-saving plan would not be enough to save Woolco from failure, so Woolworth combined the discount store operating unit with its variety stores and began to close stores in unprofitable markets including Chicago.

===Closure===
On September 24, 1982, Woolco announced it would close all of its United States stores. The final Woolco store to have a grand opening in the U.S. was the September 29, 1982 launch of the Luling, Louisiana location at St. Charles Plaza store, which was five days after the chain&#x27;s announcement of closing all stores. By January 1983, all 336 stores were shuttered. Woolco&#x27;s inventory was valued at approximately $1 billion, making Woolco&#x27;s liquidation the largest in United States history at the time. However, the Canadian division of approximately 120 stores remained open.

In 1982, the UK stores were spun off along with the British Woolworths chain in the same year. In 1986, Woolworths sold the Woolco stores to Gateway, exiting them out of their ownership. Gateway then soon sold the stores again to Asda in 1988. In the UK, Woolworths&#x27; then-parent company Kingfisher plc attempted to revive the style of Woolco with the Big W chain in 1999, which was successful but suffered when Woolworths split into its own company in 2001, and in 2004, Woolworths Group PLC scrapped the Big W chain and sold some of the stores to supermarket chains Asda and Tesco. Woolworths rebranded the Big W stores they kept under their own name and they remained until Woolworths&#x27; administration in 2008.

In 1990, 26 Woolworth stores in Canada were converted to Woolco because of their larger size. On January 14, 1994, in order to repay the $1.7 billion debt incurred from international specialty store expansion, the Woolworth Corporation sold most of the Woolco Canada stores to Walmart. Walmart did not acquire the Woolco stores that were either unionized or had downtown locations. Some Woolco stores were sold and re-opened as Zellers stores; when Zellers liquidated, some of those stores were later sold to Target Canada, which ceased operations itself in 2015 following bankruptcy.

===Canada===
In a smaller, less crowded retail market, Woolco had a bigger impact in Canada than it did in the US. The Woolco was re-branded F. W. Woolworth stores in the 1980s, but Woolworth-branded stores had been in Canada around 1904. There were 160 Woolco stores in Canada at dissolution, the chain having survived another 11 years in Canada after the US closure and before being bought out by Walmart Canada. They were so well known that Canadian songwriters Leon Dubinsky and Max MacDonald even wrote a popular song called &quot;Working at the Woolco Manager Trainee Blues&quot; (1977). During the 1970s and 1980s, the Canadian stores were well known for their monthly &quot;$1.44 Days&quot;, wherein numerous items were sold at a price of $1.44 CAD. Competitors Woodward&#x27;s and Eaton&#x27;s ran &quot;$1.49 Days&quot; usually the first Monday each month. Most stores also contained an automotive and tire service department. Most stores in Canada had an in-store restaurant section. These restaurants were named Red Grille or Strawberry Street Cafeteria, except in the province of Quebec where they were named Café Rouge or Moisson d&#x27;Or.

<doc id="382573" wikidata="Q312845" url="?curid=382573" title="Daniel Inouye">
<text>Daniel Ken Inouye ( , , September 7, 1924 – December 17, 2012) was an American attorney, soldier, and statesman who served as a United States senator from Hawaii from 1963 until his death in 2012. A Medal of Honor recipient, Inouye began his political career in territorial government. In 1959 he was elected as the first U.S. Representative for the State of Hawaii. A member of the Democratic Party, he also served as the president pro tempore of the United States Senate from 2010 until his death. Inouye was the highest-ranking Asian American politician in U.S. history. Inouye also chaired various Senate committees, including those on Intelligence, Indian Affairs, Commerce, and Appropriations.

Inouye fought in World War II as part of the 442nd Infantry Regiment. He lost his right arm to a grenade wound and received several military decorations, including the Medal of Honor (the nation&#x27;s highest military award). Inouye later earned a J.D. degree from George Washington University Law School.

Returning to Hawaii, Inouye was elected to Hawaii&#x27;s territorial House of Representatives in 1953, and was elected to the territorial Senate in 1957. When Hawaii achieved statehood in 1959, Inouye was elected as its first member of the House of Representatives. He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1962. He never lost an election in 58 years as an elected official, and he exercised an exceptionally large influence on Hawaii politics.

At the time of his death, Inouye was the last remaining U.S. Senator to have served during the presidencies of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard Nixon.

Inouye was the second Asian American senator, following Hawaii Republican Hiram Fong. Inouye was the first Japanese American to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, and the first to serve in the U.S. Senate. Because of his seniority, Inouye became president pro tempore of the Senate following the death of Robert Byrd on June 28, 2010, making him third in the presidential line of succession after the Vice President and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Inouye was a posthumous recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Order of the Paulownia Flowers. Among other public structures, Honolulu International Airport has since been renamed Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in his memory.

==Early life (1924–1942)==
Daniel Ken Inouye was born in Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii on September 7, 1924. His father, Hyotaro Inouye, was a jeweler who had immigrated to Hawaii from Japan as a child. His mother, Kame (&quot;née&quot; Imanaga) Inouye, was a homemaker born on Maui to Japanese immigrants. Her parents died young and she was adopted and raised by a family in Honolulu. Both of Daniel&#x27;s parents were Christian, and met at the River Street Methodist Church in Honolulu. They married in 1923. This heritage makes Daniel a &quot;Nisei&quot; (second-generation Japanese-American) through his father and a &quot;Sansei&quot; (third-generation) through his mother. Daniel was named after Kame&#x27;s adoptive father.

Inouye grew up in Bingham Tract, a Chinese-American enclave in Honolulu. He was raised Christian, and was the oldest of four children. As a child, Inouye collected homing pigeons, which were hatched from eggs given to him at an army base in Schofield Barracks in return for Inouye cleaning the coops. As a teenager, he worked on the local beaches teaching tourists how to surf. Inouye&#x27;s parents raised him and his siblings with a mix of American and Japanese customs. His parents spoke English at home, but had their children attend a private Japanese language school in addition to public school. Inouye dropped out of the Japanese school in 1939 because he disagreed with his instructor&#x27;s anti-American rhetoric, and focused on his studies at President William McKinley High School. Inouye intended to go to college and medical school after his planned 1942 graduation.

Inouye witnessed the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, while still a high school senior. The Japanese surprise attack brought the United States into World War II. Being a volunteer first aid instructor with the Red Cross, he was called on by his supervisor to report to a Red Cross station set up at Lunalilo Elementary School. There, Inouye tended to civilians injured by antiaircraft shells that had fallen into the city. After the United States declared war on Japan the next day, Inouye took up a paid job from his Red Cross supervisor to work there as a medical aide. For the rest of his senior year, Inouye attended school during the day, and worked at the Red Cross station at night. He graduated from McKinley High School in 1942.

Although Inouye wanted to join the armed forces after graduating, Japanese-Americans had been excluded. The United States Department of War had declared all Japanese-Americans as &quot;enemy aliens&quot;, which stipulated they could not volunteer or be drafted for military service. Inouye enrolled at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in September 1942 as a premedical student with the goal of becoming a surgeon.

==Army service (1943–1947)==

In March 1943, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, an all-&quot;Nisei&quot; combat unit. Inouye applied and was initially turned down because his work at the Red Cross was deemed critical, but was inducted later that month. The unit was composed of over 2,500 &quot;Nisei&quot; from Hawaii, and 800 from the mainland. Inouye went with his unit in April to Camp Shelby in Mississippi for a 10-month training period, postponing his medical studies. While in Mississippi, the unit visited the Rohwer War Relocation Center in Arkansas, where Inouye witnessed the internment of Japanese Americans first hand.

The 442nd shipped off to Italy in May 1944 after the conclusion of their training, shortly before the liberation of Rome. Inouye was promoted to sergeant within the first three months of fighting in the Italian countryside north of Rome. The 442nd was then sent to eastern France, where they seized the towns of Bruyères, Belmont, and Biffontaine from the Germans. In late October, the regiment was transferred to the Vosges Mountains region of France, where they rescued 211 members of the 1st Battalion of the 141st Infantry Regiment, otherwise known as the &quot;Lost Battalion&quot;. Inouye received a battlefield commission to second lieutenant for his actions there, becoming the youngest officer in his regiment. During the battle, a shot struck him in the chest directly above his heart, but the bullet was stopped by the two silver dollars he happened to have stacked in his shirt pocket. He continued to carry the coins throughout the war in his shirt pocket as good luck charms, but lost them later, shortly before the battle in which he lost his arm. The 442nd spent the next several months near Nice, guarding the French-Italian border until early 1945, when they were called to Northern Italy to assist with an assault on German strongholds in the Apennine Mountains.

===Arm injury===
On April 21, 1945, Inouye was grievously wounded while leading an assault on the heavily defended Colle Musatello ridge near San Terenzo, Italy. The ridge served as a strongpoint of the German fortifications known as the Gothic Line, the last and most unyielding line of German defensive works in Italy. During a flanking maneuver against German machine gun nests, Inouye was shot in the stomach from 40 yards away. Ignoring his wound, Inouye proceeded with the attack and together with the unit, destroyed the first two machine gun nests. As his squad distracted the third machine gunner, the injured Inouye crawled toward the final bunker and came within 10 yards. As he prepared to toss a grenade within, a German soldier fired out a 30 mm Schiessbecher antipersonnel rifle grenade at Inouye, striking Inouye in the right elbow. Although it failed to detonate, the blunt force of the grenade amputated most of his right arm at the elbow. The nature of the injury caused Inouye&#x27;s arm muscles to involuntarily squeeze the grenade tightly via a reflex arc, preventing his arm from going limp and dropping a live grenade at his feet. This injury left Inouye disabled, in terrible pain, under fire with minimal cover and staring at a live grenade &quot;clenched in a fist that suddenly didn&#x27;t belong to me anymore.&quot;

Inouye&#x27;s platoon moved to his aid, but Inouye shouted for them to keep back out of fear his severed fist would involuntarily relax and drop the grenade. As the German inside the bunker began reloading his rifle with regular full metal jacket ammunition to finish off Inouye, Inouye pried the live hand grenade from his useless right hand with his left, and tossed it into the bunker, killing the German. Stumbling to his feet, Inouye continued forward, killing at least one more German before sustaining his fifth and final wound of the day in his left leg. Inouye fell unconscious, and awoke to see the worried men of his platoon hovering over him. His only comment before being carried away was to gruffly order them back to their positions, saying &quot;Nobody called off the war!&quot; By the end of the day, the ridge had fallen to American control, without the loss of any soldiers in Inouye&#x27;s platoon. The remainder of Inouye&#x27;s mutilated right arm was later amputated at a field hospital without proper anesthesia, as he had been given too much morphine at an aid station and it was feared any more would lower his blood pressure enough to kill him. The war in Europe ended on May 8, less than three weeks later.

===Rehabilitation and discharge===

Shortly before the Japanese surrender and end of World War II in August 1945, Inouye was shipped back to the United States to recover for eleven months at a rehabilitation center for wounded soldiers in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In mid-1946, Inouye was transferred to the Percy Jones Army Hospital in Battle Creek, Michigan, to continue his rehabilitation for nine more months. While recovering there, Inouye met future Republican senator and presidential candidate Bob Dole, then a fellow patient. The two became friends and would often play bridge together. Dole shared with Inouye his long-term plans to attend law school and become an attorney, and later run for state legislature and eventually the United States Congress. With Inouye&#x27;s plans to become a surgeon dashed due to his injury, Dole&#x27;s plans for a career in public service inspired Inouye to consider entering politics. Inouye ultimately beat Dole to congress. The two remained lifelong friends. In 2003, the hospital was renamed the Hart–Dole–Inouye Federal Center in honor of the two World War II veterans, as well as Democratic senator Philip Hart, who had been a patient at the hospital after sustaining injuries on D-Day.

Inouye was honorably discharged with the rank of captain in May 1947 after 20 months of rehabilitation. At the time, he was a recipient of the Bronze Star Medal, Distinguished Service Cross, and three Purple Hearts. Many in his regiment believed that, were he not Japanese-American, he would have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation&#x27;s highest military award. Inouye eventually received the Medal of Honor on June 21, 2000, from President Bill Clinton, along with 19 other Japanese American servicemen in the 442nd.

==Entry into politics==

Inouye decided to study law hoping it would lead him into a political career. He enrolled at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa in late 1947 as a prelaw student, majoring in government and economics. Inouye relied on the financial benefits of the G.I. Bill to fund his education. When not in class, he volunteered for the Democratic Party at the Honolulu County Democratic Committee. Inouye had been talked into joining the party by John A. Burns, a former police captain and future governor, who had ties to the Japanese American community. Though the territory of Hawaii had been politically dominated by the Republican Party, Burns convinced Inouye that the Democratic Party could help Japanese Hawaiians achieve social and economic reform. During these years, Inouye met speech instructor Margaret Awamura at the university, whom he married in 1948.

After graduating in 1950, Inouye moved with his wife to Washington D.C. so he could continue his studies at George Washington University Law School. While there, Inouye volunteered at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters to gain more experience to bring back with him to Hawaii. Inouye earned his J.D. degree in two years, and moved back with his wife to Hawaii in late 1952. Inouye spent the next year studying for the Hawaii bar exam and volunteering with the Democratic Party. After passing the bar exam in August 1953, Inouye was appointed assistant public prosecutor for the city and county of Honolulu by the city mayor and fellow Democrat John Wilson.

At the urging of Burns, Inouye successfully ran for the Hawaii Territorial House of Representatives in the November 1954 election, representing the Fourth District. The election came to be known as the Hawaii Democratic Revolution of 1954, as the long-entrenched Republican control of the Hawaii Territorial Legislature abruptly ended with a wave of Democratic candidates taking their seats. The election also filled the legislature with Japanese-American politicians, who previously held few seats. Inouye was immediately elected majority leader. He served two terms there, and was elected to the Hawaii territorial senate in 1957. Midway through Inouye&#x27;s first term, Hawaii achieved statehood. He won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as Hawaii&#x27;s first full member, and took office August 21, 1959, the same date Hawaii became a state. Inouye was re-elected in 1960. While in the House of Representatives, Inouye voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960 and for the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

==United States Senate (1963–2012)==

In 1962, Inouye was elected to the U.S. Senate, succeeding retiring fellow Democrat Oren E. Long.

Inouye was the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee between 1976 and 1979 and the chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee between 1987 and 1995. He introduced the National Museum of the American Indian Act in 1984 which led to the inauguration of the National Museum of the American Indian in 2004. Inouye was chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee between 2001 and 2003, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee between 2007 and 2009, and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee between 2009 and 2012. Inouye voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Civil Rights Act of 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Inouye was reelected eight times, usually without serious difficulty. His closest race was in 1992, when state senator Rick Reed held Inouye to 57 percent of the vote; this was the only time he received less than 69 percent of the vote. Inouye delivered the keynote address at the turbulent 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago and gained national attention for his service on the Senate Watergate Committee.

Inouye was also involved in the Iran-Contra investigations of the 1980s, chairing a special committee (Senate Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan Opposition) from 1987 until 1989. During the hearings, Inouye referred to the operations that had been revealed as a &quot;secret government&quot;, saying:

Criticizing the logic of Marine Lt. Colonel Oliver North&#x27;s justifications for his actions in the affair, Inouye made reference to the Nuremberg trials, provoking a heated interruption from North&#x27;s attorney Brendan Sullivan, an exchange that was widely repeated in the media at the time. He was also seen as a pro-Taiwan senator and helped in forming the Taiwan Relations Act.

On May 1, 1977, Inouye stated that President Carter had telephoned him to express his objections to a sentence in the Senate Intelligence Committee&#x27;s report on the Central Intelligence Agency.

On November 20, 1993, Inouye voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement. The trade agreement linked the United States, Canada, and Mexico into a single free trade zone and was signed into law on December 8 by President Bill Clinton.

In 2009, Inouye assumed leadership of the powerful Senate Committee on Appropriations after longtime chairman Robert Byrd stepped down. Following the latter&#x27;s death on June 28, 2010, Inouye was elected President pro tempore, the officer third in the presidential line of succession. Inouye was the highest an Asian American had reached in the line of succession until the Vice-Presidency of Kamala Harris.

In 2010, Inouye announced his decision to run for a ninth term. He easily won the Democratic primary—the real contest in heavily Democratic Hawaii — and then won against Republican state representative Campbell Cavasso with 74 percent of the vote.

Inouye ran for Senate Majority Leader several times without success.

Prior to his death, Inouye announced that he planned to run for a record tenth term in 2016 when he would have been 92 years old. Inouye also said,

===1980s===
In 1986, West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd opted to run for Senate Majority Leader, believing that his two opponents to claiming the position would be Inouye and Louisiana Senator J. Bennett Johnston. Cutting a deal with Inouye, Byrd pledged that he would step aside from the position in 1989 if Inouye supported him for Senate Majority Leader of the 100th United States Congress. Inouye accepted the offer and was given the chance to select the new Senate sergeant-at-arms.

====Foreign policy====
In early 1981, Inouye called for tighter restrictions on what Americans can ship overseas, citing his belief that American international stature would be harmed along with the country&#x27;s foreign policy interests in the event of the shipments causing environmental damage.

In March 1981, Inouye was one of 24 elected officials to issue a joint statement calling on the Reagan administration to compose a method of finding a peaceful solution that would end The Troubles in Northern Ireland.

In July 1981, a Federal commission began hearings to decide on rewarding compensations to Japanese-Americans placed in internment camps during World War II, Inouye and fellow Hawaii Senator Spark M. Matsunaga delivering opening statements. In November, during an appearance at the opening of a 10-day public forum at Tufts University on Japanese internment, Inouye stated his opposition to distributing reparation fees for Japanese-Americans previously incarcerated during World War II, adding that it &quot;would be insulting even to try to do so.&quot; In August 1988, Inouye attended President Reagan&#x27;s signing of legislation apologizing for the internment camps and establishing a $1.25 billion trust fund to pay reparations to both those who were placed in camps and to their families. In September 1989, during the Senate&#x27;s debate over bestowing reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II, Inouye delivered his first public speech on the issue and noted $22,000 were bestowed to each captive American in the Iran hostage crisis.

In October 2002, Inouye was one of 23 senators who voted against authorization of the use of military force in Iraq.

==== Domestic policy ====
In March 1982, amid controversy surrounding Democratic Senator Harrison A. Williams&#x27; taking bribes in the Abscam sting operation, Inouye delivered a closing defense argument stating the possibility of the Senate looking foolish in the event the conviction was reversed on appeal. Inouye confirmed that he had received telephone calls regarding Williams critiquing his remarks during his defense of himself the previous week and questioned if the Senate was going to punish him &quot;because his presentation was rambling, not in the tradition of Daniel Webster&quot; and for his wife believing in him.

In October 1982, after President Reagan appointed two new members to the board of the Legal Services Corporation, Inouye was one of 32 Senators to sign a letter expressing grave concerns over the appointments.

On December 23, Inouye voted against a 5 cent a gallon increase in gasoline taxes across the U.S. imposed to aid the financing of highway repairs and mass transit. The bill passed on the last day of the 97th United States Congress.

In March 1984, Inouye voted against a constitutional amendment authorizing periods in public schools for silent prayer and against President Reagan&#x27;s unsuccessful proposal for a constitutional amendment permitting organized school prayer in public schools. In August, Inouye secured the acceptance of the Senate&#x27;s defense appropriations subcommittee for an amendment meant to cure mainland milk arriving at Hawaiian and Alaskan military bases sour, arguing thousands of gallons of milk coming from the mainland must be dumped due to their souring and said shipments were arriving eight days after pasteurization.

In February 1989, after Oliver North went on trial in Federal District Court amid accusations that he illegally diverted profits from the secret sale of arms to Iran to the Nicaraguan rebels, Jack Brooks, then-chair of the House Oversight Committee, questioned North&#x27;s role in composing a &quot;contingency plan in the event of an emergency that would suspend the American Constitution.&quot; Inouye replied that the inquiry touched on a classified and sensitive matter that would only be discussed in a closed session.

===Alleged sexual misconduct===
In 1992, Inouye&#x27;s hairdresser made allegations of sexual misconduct initiating with a 1975 incident wherein she was placed on an errand to his apartment, which he denied. Although reaching press nationally, consensus was that Hawaii&#x27;s culture of silence towards indiscretions of those in power, prevailed. A Senate ethics committee review was dropped in 1993 over lack of participation or refusal to be publicly identified by accusers.

In 2014, two years after Inouye&#x27;s death, senator Kirsten Gillibrand from New York wrote in her autobiography about a male colleague who squeezed her waist and commented: &quot;Don&#x27;t lose too much weight now. I like my girls chubby!&quot; Although not named in the autobiography, &quot;The New York Times&quot; identified Inouye as the perpetrator, setting off national discussion of Inouye&#x27;s past. In 2017, discussion resurfaced in local Hawaii media about the power of Inouye, and hence deference given to him politically and publicly, with the #MeToo movement providing impetus for just one more of the nine accusers coming forward publicly. The former staffer told about how Inouye initiated with asking her to rub his shoulders in his office, continuing with him later trying to put his hand on her leg once when in an automobile. When she tried to stop him, he grabbed her hand. During a trip to the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, after a late-night simulcast to Hawaii, he asked her if she was hungry, and offered her a ride, inviting her to a late dinner in his room. Upon arriving in the room, he requested she sit next to him on the bed. She complied but immediately stood away, and called a fellow female staffer to join her there. Shortly thereafter, Inouye tried to bring his hand under her skirt while the two were riding together in an automobile; the staffer thwarted Inouye&#x27;s advances with her hand. The corroborator of her story requested to remain anonymous.

A state lawmaker, who learned about the 1992 accusations through a PBS television program, questioned the 2016 renaming of the Honolulu International Airport after Inouye. They declined seeking the renaming while receiving criticism from within and outside the Hawaii Democratic party for labeling Inouye as &quot;an accused serial rapist.&quot;

===Gang of 14===
On May 23, 2005, Inouye was a member of a bipartisan group of 14 moderate senators, known as the Gang of 14, to forge a compromise on the Democrats&#x27; use of the judicial filibuster, thus blocking the Republican leadership&#x27;s attempt to implement the &quot;nuclear option&quot;, a means of forcibly ending a filibuster. Under the agreement, the Democrats would retain the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot;, and the three most conservative Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen, and William H. Pryor Jr.) would receive a vote by the full U.S. Senate.

==Electoral history==

Inouye never lost an election.

In August 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson placed a phone call to vice president and Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey, urging him to select Inouye as his running mate. Johnson went as far as to request a background check on Inouye from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Johnson told Humphrey that Inouye&#x27;s World War II injuries would silence Humphrey&#x27;s critics on the Vietnam War: &quot;He answers Vietnam with that empty sleeve. He answers your problems with (Republican presumptive presidential nominee and former vice president Richard) Nixon with that empty sleeve&quot;, Johnson said. Humphrey eventually chose Edmund Muskie as his running mate, and lost the election. According to his chief of staff, Jennifer Sabas, Inouye knew that he was being considered as a vice presidential pick, but was uninterested in the possibility, apparently content with his current position.

==Family==

Inouye&#x27;s first wife was Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Shinobu Awamura, who was working as a speech instructor at the University of Hawaiʻi when Inouye was attending as a prelaw student after the war. The two married on June 12, 1948, at the Harris Memorial Methodist Church in Honolulu. She died of cancer on March 13, 2006. On May 24, 2008, Inouye married Irene Hirano in a private ceremony in Beverly Hills, California. Hirano was president and founding chief executive officer of the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, California. She resigned the position at the time of her marriage, in order to be closer to her husband. According to the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot;, Inouye was 24 years older than Hirano. On May 27, 2010, Hirano was elected chair of the nation&#x27;s second largest non-profit organization, The Ford Foundation. Hirano outlived him by more than seven years; she died on April 7, 2020.

Inouye&#x27;s son, Kenny, was the guitarist for the hardcore punk band Marginal Man.

In November 2012, Inouye sustained a minor cut after falling in his apartment and was treated at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. On December 6, he was again hospitalized at George Washington University Hospital so doctors could further regulate his oxygen intake, and was transferred to Walter Reed Medical Center four days later. Inouye died there of respiratory complications on December 17, 2012. According to the senator&#x27;s Congressional website, his last word was &quot;Aloha.&quot; Prior to his death, Inouye left a letter encouraging Governor Neil Abercrombie to appoint Colleen Hanabusa to succeed Inouye should he become incapacitated; instead Abercrombie appointed Lieutenant Governor Brian Schatz until a November 2014 special election, which Schatz won.
