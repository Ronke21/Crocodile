<text>The Royal Festival Hall is a 2,700-seat concert, dance and talks venue within Southbank Centre in London, England. It is situated on the South Bank of the River Thames, not far from Hungerford Bridge, in the London Borough of Lambeth. It is a Grade I listed building, the first post-war building to become so protected (in 1981). The London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the London Sinfonietta, Chineke! and Aurora are resident orchestras at Southbank Centre.

The hall was built as part of the Festival of Britain for London County Council, and was officially opened on 3 May 1951. When the LCC&#x27;s successor, the Greater London Council, was abolished in 1986, the Festival Hall was taken over by the Arts Council, and managed together with the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room (opened 1967) and the Hayward Gallery (1968), eventually becoming an independent arts organisation, now known as the Southbank Centre, in April 1998.

The complex includes several reception rooms, bars and restaurants, and the Clore Ballroom, accommodating up to 440 for a seated dinner. A large head and shoulders bust of Nelson Mandela (by Ian Walters, created in 1985) stands on the walkway between the hall and Hungerford Bridge approach viaduct. Originally made in glass-fibre it was repeatedly vandalised until re-cast in bronze.

The complex&#x27;s variety of open spaces and foyers are popular for social or work-related meetings.

The closest tube stations are and, across the river via the Jubilee Bridges, and .

== The original building ==
The Festival Hall project was led by London County Council&#x27;s then chief architect, Robert Matthew, who gathered around him a young team of talented designers including Leslie Martin, who was eventually to lead the project with Edwin Williams and Peter Moro, along with the furniture designer Robin Day and his wife, the textile designer Lucienne Day. The acoustical consultant was Hope Bagenal, working with members of the Building Research Station; Henry Humphreys, Peter Parkin and William Allen. Martin was 39 at the time, and very taken with the Nordic activities of Alvar Aalto and Gunnar Asplund.

The figure who really drove the project forward was Herbert Morrison, a Labour Party politician. It was he who had insisted that Matthew had Martin as his deputy architect, treating the Festival Hall as a special project.

===Architecture===
A 1948 sketch by Martin shows the design of the concert hall as the egg in a box. But the strength of the design was the arrangement of interior space: the central staircase has a ceremonial feel and moves elegantly through the different levels of light and air.

They were concerned that whilst the scale of the project demanded a monumental building, it should not ape the triumphal classicism of many earlier public buildings. The wide open foyers, with bars and restaurants, were intended to be meeting places for all: there were to be no separate bars for different classes of patron. Because these public spaces were built around the auditorium, they also had the effect of insulating the Hall from the noise of the adjacent railway bridge.

To quote Leslie Martin, &quot;The suspended auditorium provides the building with its major attributes: the great sense of space that is opened out within the building, the flowing circulation from the symmetrically placed staircases and galleries that became known as the &#x27;egg in the box&#x27;.&quot;

The hall they built used modernism&#x27;s favourite material, reinforced concrete, alongside more luxurious elements including beautiful woods and Derbyshire fossilised limestone. The exterior of the building was bright white, intended to contrast with the blackened city surrounding it. Large areas of glass on its façade meant that light coursed freely throughout the interior, and at night, the glass let the light from inside flood out onto the river, in contrast to the darkness which befell the rest of London after dusk.

The hall originally seated 2,901. The cantilevered boxes are often described as looking like drawers pulled out in a hurried burglary, but none has a compromised sightline. The ceiling was wilfully sculptural, a conceit at the very edge of building technology and, as it turns out, way beyond the contemporary understanding of acoustics. Robin Day, who designed the furniture for the auditorium, used a clearly articulated structure in his designs of bent plywood and steel.

The original building had lushly planted roof terraces; the Level Two foyer café had been able to spill out onto the terraces looking out on the river, and original entrances were positioned on the sides of the building, enabling visitors to arrive directly at the stairs leading to the auditorium.

The foundation stone was laid in 1949 by Prime Minister Clement Attlee on the site of the former Lion Brewery, built in 1837. The building was constructed by Holland, Hannen &amp; Cubitts at a cost of £2 million and officially opened on 3 May 1951 with a gala concert attended by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent and Sir Adrian Boult. The first general manager was T. E. Bean, who had previously managed the Hallé Orchestra.

&quot;I was overwhelmed by a shock of breathless delight at the originality and beauty of the interior. It felt as if I had been instantly transported far into the future and that I was on another planet,&quot; said journalist Bernard Levin of his first impressions of the building.

===Organ===
The 7,866 pipe organ was built during 1950–1954 by Harrison &amp; Harrison in Durham, to the specification of the London County Council&#x27;s consultant, Ralph Downes, who also supervised the tonal finishing. It was designed as a well-balanced classical instrument embracing a number of rich and varied ensembles which alone or in combination could equal the dynamic scale of any orchestra or choral grouping, in addition to coping with the entire solo repertoire.

The design principles enshrined in its construction gave rise to a whole new school of organ building, known as the English Organ Reform Movement, influencing in the UK alone the cathedral organs of Coventry and Blackburn and the concert hall organs of the Fairfield Halls, Croydon, and the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester: there are also innumerable organs in other countries which have been influenced by it.

However, the design of the organ in its housing made maintenance difficult, and by 2000 it had become unusable. It was consequently completely removed before restoration of the Hall itself began in 2005, and after restoration and updating by Harrison &amp; Harrison, a third of the organ was reinstalled. The remainder was reinstalled between 2012 and 2013, and voicing completed in 2014.

===Acoustics===
The Festival Hall was one of the first concert halls in the world to be built using the application of scientific principles, both theoretical and experimental. Hope Bagenal and his colleagues from the Building Research Station formed an integral part of the design team. The acoustic behaviour of the seats was measured and tested in a laboratory to enable more exacting design. Careful consideration of external noise problems was undertaken.

Following the opening of the hall, there was some criticism of certain aspects of the acoustics. This was partially attributable to the fact that some of the original specifications for room surfaces determined by the acoustic consultants were ignored in the building process. A specific problem for performers was the difficulty of hearing each other on the platform. Both the angled &#x27;blast&#x27; side walls and the plywood reflectors projected sound away from the stage.

The general consensus was that the hall was &#x27;too dry&#x27;, not reverberant enough, particularly at low frequencies, and that the bass tone was weak. The definition was &#x27;excellent&#x27; for chamber and modern music, but the hall was not as effective for music of the late Classical or Romantic period. Sir John Barbirolli commented, &quot;Everything is sharp and clear and there is no impact, no fullness on the climaxes.&quot;
===Heating systems===

A water source heat pump was used to heat the building in the winter and cool the building in the summer. Water was extracted from the River Thames below Hungerford Bridge using a centrifugal pump. Heat was extracted from the river water using a heat pump. The compressors were driven by two Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, adapted to run on town gas. It was highly successful, providing both heating and cooling for the Hall, but over-sized, and was sold off after the Festival of Britain.

==The 1964 alterations==
As a structure, the new Festival Hall was technically stretched, and maintenance was soon required. The building was substantially altered in 1964 by adding the foyers and terraces to the river side of the building, extending the footprint by 30 ft, and more dressing rooms to the rear. Alterations to the façades overlooking the river removed the decorative tiles, altering the Scandinavian Modernism of the building&#x27;s primary public face in favour of a plainer and hard-edged style. The building&#x27;s original entrance sequence was much compromised by these changes and the later additions of raised concrete walkways around the building to serve the neighbouring Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Room and The Hayward, built in 1967/8.

===Assisted resonance===
Leo Beranek, an American acoustics engineer who had undertaken measurements of all of the world&#x27;s leading concert halls, had identified that the interior treatment of the auditorium was absorbing too much sound. By 1962 the authorities, after prolonged experiment, had become convinced that no improvement in the hall&#x27;s reverberation could be achieved by any further treatment of its surfaces. Longer reverberation would require modification to the main structure, reducing the seating capacity and the provision of a new ceiling. This was considered too costly, particularly as any hypothetical gain in &#x27;warmth&#x27; or &#x27;resonance&#x27; might well be by the sacrifice of other positive qualities for which the Hall was generally esteemed, for example, its clarity, its comparative uniformity of acoustic response and its freedom from echo.

It was known that the ancient Greeks had developed the technique of using vases built into their auditoria which added resonance to strengthen tone or improve its quality, though the effect was very weak. The Building Research Station developed an electronic method of lengthening the reverberation time by a system called &#x27;assisted resonance&#x27; in which some of the acoustical energy lost to the surfaces of the hall was replaced by acoustical energy supplied by a loudspeaker. Each microphone and its associated loudspeaker was limited to the one frequency by placing the microphone inside a Helmholtz resonator fitted into the ceiling in a range of sizes which resonated over a wide range of the low frequencies which critics and musicians thought did not adequately reverberate in the hall. 172 channels were used to cover a frequency range of 58 Hz to 700 Hz, increasing reverberation time from 1.4 to 2.5 s in the 125 Hz octave band. However, the system never fully solved the problem, and as it aged it became unreliable, occasionally emitting odd sounds during performances. It was switched off in 1998, which returned the acoustics to their poor state, so bad that they make performers who play in it &quot;lose the will to live&quot;, according to Sir Simon Rattle.

==The 2007 renovation==
The building underwent a substantial renovation between 2005 and 2007 aimed at improving the poor acoustics and building layout, led by architect Diane Haigh of Allies and Morrison with consulting engineer firms Max Fordham LLP (M&amp;E) and Price &amp; Myers (structural). The interior of the concert hall space was almost entirely intact until this re-modelling, which saw its stage canopy and walls rebuilt in plainer more rectangular forms. Seating was reduced slightly to 2,788, including the choir seating. This was carried out in the face of opposition from conservationists, led by the Twentieth Century Society.

On the advice of acoustics firm, Kirkegaard Associates, the lack of reverberation and the difficult performance conditions for musicians were corrected by changes in the fabric of the auditorium. Surfaces that had previously absorbed sound were transformed to support and sustain that sound. The tapestries on the back walls of the boxes were gathered up to increase reverberation, but can be redeployed, together with additional absorbent blinds above the stage and around the Hall whenever needed. The wooden wall panels of the Hall were relined to change their acoustic qualities and the undulating plaster ceiling panels were completely reconstructed using more robust materials to provide greater warmth of sound and support for bass frequencies.

New adjustable acoustic canopies were placed over the stage&#x27;s width to allow bass frequencies to resonate in the space above the stage, and for treble frequencies to be reflected back to improve feedback to performers. The stage was reconfigured to provide more space for performers, and the arrangement of walls around the stage was altered significantly. The original Robin Day designed seats were restored and reupholstered to make them more comfortable, and more acoustically appropriate.

The major refurbishment presented an opportunity to add to the infrastructure of the venue to make the process of &#x27;get-in&#x27; and &#x27;get-out&#x27; in a single day easier, and to add to the flexibility of the venue. Theatre consultants Carr &amp; Angier worked with ISG Interior Exterior and Stage Technologies to create a new working space over the stage area with four large movable lighting bridges, capable of load sharing to lift large touring productions without the need for custom rigging. Delstar Engineering supplied eleven lifts to form the stage platform. These allow the stage layout to be reconfigured in many ways to suit the nature of the performance taking place. The choir benches can now be wheeled out to provide a level floor for staged and dance performances. The space between seat rows has been extended by 75mm by rebuilding the concrete floor of the stalls, with a loss of only 118 seats. Cooling has been introduced by reversing the airflow in the auditorium.

During the 2000s a building comprising seven commercial units was erected opposite the western side of the hall, with many of the Southbank administrative offices above. Shops and restaurants were added along the river frontage.

The venue officially reopened to the public in June 2007. The refurbishment was estimated to have cost in the region of £91 million. A film documenting the refurbishment, entitled &quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot;, was directed by Paul Kelly and produced by Andrew Hinton.

===Organ refurbishment===
The organ has been reconfigured to suit the new architectural and acoustic requirements: its depth has been reduced by 110 cm, but the basic principles of the layout have been respected.

Following a successful campaign to raise £2.3 million for a full restoration and reinstallation of the organ, the original organ builders, Harrison &amp; Harrison, finally completed the reinstallation on 29 August 2013. Further work including re-balancing the pipework followed and was completed in time for the re-inauguration of the organ on 18 March 2014, exactly 60 years since it was first inaugurated. The first orchestral and organ concert was on 26 March 2014 and was recorded for the London Philharmonic Orchestra&#x27;s own live label. The organ remains the third largest organ in Great Britain by number of pipes, with 7,866 pipes and 103 speaking stops.. The organ sounds uncomfortably constrained in the hall acoustic and is seldom played, either for recitals or to accompany orchestral concerts.

<text>The Two Micron All-Sky Survey, or 2MASS, was an astronomical survey of the whole sky in infrared light. It took place between 1997 and 2001, in two different locations: at the U.S. Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, each using a 1.3-meter telescope for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, respectively. It was conducted in the short-wavelength infrared at three distinct frequency bands (J, H, and K) near 2 micrometres, from which the photometric survey with its HgCdTe detectors derives its name.

2MASS produced an astronomical catalog with over 300 million observed objects, including minor planets of the Solar System, brown dwarfs, low-mass stars, nebulae, star clusters and galaxies. In addition, 1 million objects were cataloged in the &quot;2MASS Extended Source Catalog&quot; (&quot;2MASX&quot;). The cataloged objects are designated with a &quot;2MASS&quot; and &quot;2MASX&quot;-prefix respectively.

== Catalog ==

The final data release for 2MASS occurred in 2003, and is served by the Infrared Science Archive. The goals of this survey included:
* Detection of galaxies in the &quot;Zone of Avoidance&quot;, a strip of sky obscured in visible light by our own galaxy, the Milky Way.
* Detection of brown dwarfs. 2MASS discovered a total of 173, including 2MASS 0939-2448, 2MASS 0415-0935, 2M1207, and 2MASS J04414489+2301513.
* An extensive survey of low mass stars, the most common type of star both in our own galaxy and others.
* Cataloging of all detected stars and galaxies.
* Infrared measurements from the 2MASS survey have been particularly effective at unveiling previously undiscovered star clusters.

Numerical descriptions of point sources (stars, planets, asteroids) and extended sources (galaxies, nebulae) were cataloged by automated computer programs to an average limiting magnitude of about 14. More than 300 million point sources and 1 million extended sources were cataloged. In November 2003, a team of scientists announced the discovery of the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, at that time the closest known satellite galaxy to the Milky Way, based on analysis of 2MASS stellar data.

The resulting data and images from the survey are currently in the public domain, and may be accessed online for free by anyone. There is also a list of 2MASS science publications with links to free pre-publication copies of the papers.

2MASS is sponsored by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC, run by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Caltech), NASA, and the National Science Foundation (NSF).

<doc id="392197" wikidata="Q1264482" url="?curid=392197" title="Duke of Buccleuch">
<text>Duke of Buccleuch ( ), formerly also spelt Duke of Buccleugh, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland created twice on 20 April 1663, first for James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, and second &quot;suo jure&quot; for his wife Anne Scott, 4th Countess of Buccleuch. Monmouth, the eldest illegitimate son of King Charles II, was attainted after rebelling against his uncle King James II and VII, but his wife&#x27;s title was unaffected and passed on to their descendants, who have successively borne the surnames &quot;Scott&quot;, &quot;Montagu-Scott&quot;, &quot;Montagu Douglas Scott&quot; and &quot;Scott&quot; again. In 1810, the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch inherited the [[Duke of Queensberry|Dukedom of Queensberry]], also in the Peerage of Scotland, thus separating that title from the Marquessate of Queensberry. 

The substantial origin of the ducal house of the Scotts of Buccleuch dates back to the large grants of lands in Scotland to Sir Walter Scott of Kirkurd and Buccleuch, a border chief, by King James II, in consequence of the fall of the 8th Earl of Douglas (1452), but the family traced their descent back to a Sir Richard le Scott (1240–1285). Sir Walter Scott of Branxholme and Buccleuch (died 1552) distinguished himself at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh (1547). His great-grandson Sir Walter was created Lord Scott of Buccleuch in 1606.

Other subsidiary titles associated with the Dukedom of Buccleuch are: Earl of Buccleuch (1619), Earl of Dalkeith (1663) and Lord Scott of Whitchester and Eskdaill (1619) (all in the Peerage of Scotland). The Duke also holds the two subsidiary titles of the attainted Dukedom of Monmouth, namely Earl of Doncaster (1663) and Baron Scott of Tindale (1663) (both in the Peerage of England), and several subsidiary titles associated with the Dukedom of Queensberry, namely Marquess of Dumfriesshire (1683), Earl of Drumlanrig and Sanquhar (1682), Viscount of Nith, Tortholwald and Ross (1682) and Lord Douglas of Kilmount, Middlebie and Dornock (1682) (all in the Peerage of Scotland). The Earldom of Doncaster and Barony of Scott of Tindale had been forfeit at the time of the first Duke&#x27;s attainder, but the titles were restored to the 2nd Duke of Buccleuch in 1742. Until 1835, the Dukes also held lands in the West Riding of Yorkshire and the ancient title of Lord of Bowland. The Duke of Buccleuch is the hereditary chief of Clan Scott. The holder is one of only five people in the UK to hold two or more different dukedoms, the others being the Duke of Cornwall, Rothesay, and Cambridge (all currently held by the Prince of Wales), the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, the Duke of Argyll (who holds two dukedoms named Argyll), and the Duke of Richmond, Lennox and Gordon. 

The courtesy title used by the Duke&#x27;s eldest son and heir is &quot;Earl of Dalkeith&quot;; and that of Lord Dalkeith&#x27;s eldest son and heir is &quot;Lord Eskdaill&quot;.

The novelist Sir Walter Scott, Bart., was directly descended of the Lords of Buccleuch. His family history, fancifully interpreted, is the main subject of much of &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot;.

The current Duke of Buccleuch, Richard Scott, the 10th Duke, is one of the largest private landowners in Scotland with some 200,000 acres (over 80,000 hectares) and chairman of the Buccleuch Group, a holding company with interests in commercial property, rural affairs, food, and beverages. The title originally comes from a holding in the Scottish Borders, near Selkirk.

The family seats are Bowhill House, three miles from Selkirk, representing the Scott line; Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, representing the Douglas line; and Boughton House in Northamptonshire, England, representing the Montagu line. These three houses are still lived in by the family and are also open to the public. The family also owns Dalkeith Palace in Midlothian, which is let, and has owned several other country houses and castles in the past. Its historic London residence was Montagu House, Whitehall, now demolished and replaced by the Ministry of Defence.

William Montagu Douglas Scott, The Earl of Dalkeith, who became the 7th Duke of Buccleuch was elected President of St. Andrew&#x27;s Ambulance Association in 1908. The Presidency of the Association (now St Andrew&#x27;s First Aid) has been held by the Buccleuch family from that date.

Sarah, Duchess of York, former wife of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, is a great-great-granddaughter of the 6th Duke of Buccleuch. 

The 7th Duke of Buccleuch had a daughter, Alice, who married Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester (third son of King George V and uncle of Queen Elizabeth II) in 1935, becoming a member of the British Royal Family. Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester and Prince William of Gloucester are grandsons of the 7th Duke of Buccleuch.

Most of the Dukes of Buccleuch (the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th) are buried in the Buccleuch Memorial Chapel in St. Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Dalkeith, Midlothian. The 2nd Duke (died 1751) is buried in Eton College Chapel. The most recent Dukes (the 8th and 9th) are buried among the ruins of Melrose Abbey in Melrose.

Dukes of Buccleuch are invariably granted the honour of Knight of the Order of the Thistle.

<text>In the context of labor law in the United States, the term right-to-work laws refers to state laws that prohibit union security agreements between employers and labor unions. Such agreements can be incorporated into union contracts to require employees who are not union members to contribute to the costs of union representation. Unlike the right to work definition as a human right in international law, U.S. right-to-work laws do not aim to provide a general guarantee of employment to people seeking work but rather guarantee an employee&#x27;s right to refrain from being a member of a labor union.

The 1947 federal Taft–Hartley Act governing private sector employment prohibits the &quot;closed shop&quot; in which employees are required to be members of a union as a condition of employment, but allows the union shop or &quot;agency shop&quot; in which employees pay a fee for the cost of representation without joining the union. Individual U.S. states set their own policies for state and local government employees (i.e. public sector employees). Twenty-eight states have right-to-work policies (either by statutes or by constitutional provision). In 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that agency shop arrangements for public sector employees were unconstitutional in the case &quot;Janus v. AFSCME&quot;.

== History ==

===Origins===
The original use of the term &quot;right to work&quot; was coined by French socialist leader Louis Blanc before 1848. According to the American Enterprise Institute, the modern usage of the term &quot;right to work&quot; was coined by &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; editorial writer William Ruggles in 1941.

According to &quot;PandoDaily&quot;, the modern term was coined by Vance Muse, a Republican Party operative who headed the Christian American Association, an early right-to-work advocacy group, to replace the term &quot;American Plan&quot; after it became associated with the anti-union violence of the First Red Scare. Muse used racial segregationist arguments in advocating for anti-union laws.

According to &quot;Slate&quot;, right-to-work laws are derived from legislation forbidding unions from forcing strikes on workers, as well as from legal principles such as freedom of contract, which sought to prevent passage of laws regulating workplace conditions.

===Wagner Act (1935)===
The National Labor Relations Act, generally known as the Wagner Act, was passed in 1935 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Second New Deal&quot;. Among other things, the act provided that a company could lawfully agree to be any of the following:
* A closed shop, in which employees must be members of the union as a condition of employment. Under a closed shop, an employee who ceased being a member of the union for whatever reason, from failure to pay dues to expulsion from the union as an internal disciplinary punishment, was required to be fired even if the employee did not violate any of the employer&#x27;s rules.
* A union shop, which allows for hiring non-union employees, provided that the employees then join the union within a certain period.
* An agency shop, in which employees must pay the equivalent of the cost of union representation, but need not formally join the union.
* An open shop, in which an employee cannot be compelled to join or pay the equivalent of dues to a union or be fired for joining the union.

The act tasked the National Labor Relations Board, which had existed since 1933, with overseeing the rules.

===Taft–Hartley Act (1947)===
In 1947, the U.S. Congress passed the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, generally known as the Taft–Hartley Act, over President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s veto. The act repealed some parts of the Wagner Act, including outlawing the closed shop. Section 14(b) of the Taft–Hartley Act also authorizes individual states (but not local governments, such as cities or counties) to outlaw the union shop and agency shop for employees working in their jurisdictions. Any state law that outlaws such arrangements is known as a &quot;right-to-work state&quot;.

===Current status===
The federal government operates under open shop rules nationwide, but many of its employees are represented by unions. Unions that represent professional athletes have written contracts that include particular representation provisions (such as in the National Football League), but their application is limited to &quot;wherever and whenever legal,&quot; as the Supreme Court has clearly held that the application of a right-to-work law is determined by the employee&#x27;s &quot;predominant job situs&quot;. Players on professional sports teams in states with right-to-work laws are thus subject to those laws and cannot be required to pay any portion of union dues as a condition of continued employment.

==Arguments for and against==

===Rights of dissenting minority and due process===
The first arguments concerning the right to work centered on the rights of a dissenting minority with respect to an opposing majoritarian collective bargain. President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal had prompted many U.S. Supreme Court challenges, including those regarding the constitutionality of the National Industry Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. In 1936, as a part of its ruling in &quot;Carter v. Carter Coal Co.&quot; the Court ruled against mandatory collective bargaining, stating:

The effect, in respect to wages and hours, is to subject the dissentient minority ... to the will of the stated majority . ... To &#x27;accept&#x27; in these circumstances, is not to exercise a choice, but to surrender to force. The power conferred upon the majority is, in effect, the power to regulate the affairs of an unwilling minority. This is legislative delegation in its most obnoxious form; for it is not even delegation to an official or an official body ... but to private persons . ... [A] statute which attempts to confer such power undertakes an intolerable and unconstitutional interference with personal liberty and private property. The delegation is so clearly arbitrary, and so clearly a denial of rights safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, that it is unnecessary to do more than refer to decisions of this Court which foreclose the question.

===Freedom of association===
Besides the Supreme Court, other proponents of right-to-work laws also point to the U.S. Constitution and the right to freedom of association. They argue that workers should both be free to join unions or to refrain, and thus, sometimes refer to states without right-to-work laws as forced unionism states. These proponents argue that by being forced into a collective bargain, what the majoritarian unions call a fair share of collective bargaining costs, is actually financial coercion and a violation of freedom of choice. An opponent to the union bargain is forced to financially support an organization for which they did not vote in order to receive monopoly representation for which they have no choice.

The Seventh-day Adventist Church discourages the joining of unions, citing the writings of Ellen White, one of the church&#x27;s founders, and what writer Diana Justice calls the &quot;loss of free will&quot; that occurs when a person joins a labor union.

===Unfairness===
Proponents such as the Mackinac Center for Public Policy contend that it is unfair that unions can require new and existing employees to either join the union or pay fees for collective bargaining expenses as a condition of employment under union security agreement contracts. Other proponents contend that unions may still be needed in new and growing sectors of the economy, for example the voluntary and third party sectors, to assure adequate benefits for new immigrant, part-time aides such as the direct support professional workforce.

===Political contributions===
Right-to-work proponents, including the Center for Union Facts, contend that political contributions made by unions are not representative of the union workers. The agency shop portion of this had previously been contested with support of National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation in &quot;Communications Workers of America v. Beck&quot;, resulting in &quot;Beck rights&quot; preventing agency fees from being used for expenses outside of collective bargaining if the non-union worker notifies the union of their objection. The right to challenge the fees must include the right to have it heard by an impartial fact finder. &quot;Beck&quot; applies only to unions in the private sector, given agency fees were struck down for public-sector unions in &quot;Janus v. AFSCME&quot; in 2018.

===Free riders===
Opponents, such as Richard Kahlenberg, have argued that right-to-work laws simply &quot;gives employees the right to be free riders—to benefit from collective bargaining without paying for it.&quot; Benefits the dissenting union members would receive despite not paying dues also include representation during arbitration proceedings. In &quot;Abood v. Detroit BoE&quot;, the Supreme Court of the United States permitted public-sector unions to charge non-members agency fees so that employees in the public sector could be required to pay for the costs of representation, even as they opted not to be a member, as long as these fees are not spent on the union&#x27;s political or ideological agenda. This decision was reversed, however, in &quot;Janus v. AFSCME&quot;, with the Supreme Court ruling that such fees violate the First Amendment in the case of public-sector unions, arguing that all bargaining by a public-sector union can be considered political activity.

===Freedom of contract and association===
Opponents argue that right-to-work laws restrict freedom of association, and limit the sorts of agreements that individuals acting collectively can make with their employer by prohibiting workers and employers from agreeing to contracts that include fair share fees. They also argue that American law imposes a duty of fair representation on unions, so non-members in right-to-work states can force unions to provide grievance services without compensation that are paid by union members. Kahlenberg and Marvit also argue that, at least in efforts to pass a right-to-work law in Michigan, excluding police and firefighter unions—traditionally less hostile to Republicans—from the law caused some to question claims that the law was simply an effort to improve Michigan&#x27;s businesses climate, not to seek partisan advantage.

In December 2012, libertarian writer J. D. Tuccille wrote in &quot;Reason&quot;: &quot;I consider the restrictions right-to-work laws impose on bargaining between unions and businesses to violate freedom of contract and association. ... I&#x27;m disappointed that the state has, once again, inserted itself into the marketplace to place its thumb on the scale in the never-ending game of playing business and labor off against one another. ... This is not to say that unions are always good. It means that, when the state isn&#x27;t involved, they&#x27;re private organizations that can offer value to their members.&quot;

==Studies of economic effect==
Many studies of the effect of right-to-work laws exist but they find substantially different results. Studies have found both &quot;some positive effect on job growth&quot; and no effect. A 2019 paper in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; by economists from MIT, Stanford, and the U.S. Census Bureau, which surveyed 35,000 U.S. manufacturing plants, found that &quot;the business environment, as measured by right-to-work laws, boosts incentive management practices.&quot; According to a 2020 study published in the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot;, right-to-work laws lead to greater economic inequality by indirectly reducing the power of labor unions. Looking at the growth of states in the Southeast following World War II, economist Tim Bartik says that while these states have right-to-work laws, they have also benefited from &quot;factors like the widespread use of air conditioning and different modes of transportation that helped decentralize manufacturing.&quot;

Economist Thomas Holmes argues that it is difficult to analyze right-to-work laws by comparing states because of other similarities between states that have passed these laws. For instance, right-to-work states often have some strong pro-business policies, making it difficult to isolate the effect of right-to-work laws. Holmes compared counties close to the border between states with and without right-to-work laws, thereby holding constant an array of factors related to geography and climate. He found that the cumulative growth of employment in manufacturing in the right-to-work states was 26% greater than that in the non-right-to-work states. Given the study design, Holmes writes that &quot;my results do not say that it is right-to-work laws that matter, but rather that the &#x27;pro-business package&#x27; offered by right-to-work states seems to matter.&quot; Moreover, as noted by Kevin Drum and others, this result may reflect business relocation rather than an overall enhancement of economic growth since, as Drum writes, &quot;businesses prefer locating in states where costs are low and rules are lax&quot;.

==Polling==
In January 2012, in the immediate aftermath of passage of Indiana&#x27;s right-to-work law, a Rasmussen Reports telephone survey found that 74% of likely voters disagreed with the question &quot;Should workers who do not belong to a union be required by law to pay union dues if the company they work for is unionized?&quot; but found that &quot;most also don&#x27;t think a non-union worker should enjoy benefits negotiated by the union.&quot;

In January through March 2013, 43% of those polled believed that the law would help Michigan&#x27;s economy, while 41% believed that it would hurt.

==Political support==
In 2012, President Barack Obama opposed right-to-work legislation in Michigan. In 2017, Republican members of Congress introduced legislation for a national right-to-work law.

==U.S. states with right-to-work laws==

As of May 2024, the following 26 states have right-to-work laws:

The territory of Guam also has right-to-work laws.

Ohio allows employees to opt out from joining a union, but unions are allowed to charge a typically smaller fee for employees that opted out.

===Local or repealed laws===
Some states had right-to-work laws in the past, but repealed them or had them declared invalid. There are also some counties and municipalities located in states without right-to-work laws that have passed local laws to ban union security agreements.

====Delaware====
Seaford passed a right-to-work ordinance in 2018, despite the State Solicitor disputing the authority of local governments to do so under Delaware law. Later that year, the Delaware General Assembly blocked the municipal ordinance.

====Illinois====
Lincolnshire passed a local right-to-work ordinance, but it was struck down by the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court resulted in the case being vacated as being moot because in the intervening period Illinois had passed the Illinois Collective Bargaining Freedom Act to invalidate such local ordinances.

In a 2022 referendum, voters in Illinois approved a state constitutional amendment establishing a right to collective bargaining. The amendment also prevents any future state legislature or local government from passing a right-to-work law.

====Indiana====
Before its passage in 2012, the Republican-controlled Indiana General Assembly passed a right-to-work bill in 1957, which led to the Democratic takeover of Indiana&#x27;s Governor&#x27;s Mansion and General Assembly in the coming elections, and eventually, the new Democratic-controlled legislature repealing the right-to-work law in 1965. Right-to-work was subsequently reenacted in 2012.

==== Kentucky ====
On November 18, 2016, the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the right of local governments to enact local right-to-work laws in Kentucky. Kentucky had 12 local ordinances. A statewide law was subsequently enacted in 2017.

==== Michigan ====
Michigan adopted a right-to-work bill in 2012. After Democrats gained a trifecta in 2023, the legislature passed a bill repealing the right-to-work law, which was subsequently signed into law by Governor Whitmer and took effect in 2024.

==== Missouri ====
The legislature passed a right-to-work bill in 2017, but the law was defeated in a 2018 referendum before it could take effect.

====New Hampshire====
New Hampshire adopted a right-to-work bill in 1947, but it was repealed in 1949 by the state legislature and governor.

In 2017, a proposed right to work bill was defeated in the New Hampshire House of Representatives 200–177. In 2021, the same bill was reintroduced but again defeated in the House of Representatives 199–175.

==== New Mexico ====
New Mexico law previously did not explicitly prohibit nor allow mandatory union membership as a condition of employment at the statewide level, thereby leaving it up to local jurisdictions to establish their own right-to-work policies. Several counties, notably Chaves, Eddy, Lea, Lincoln, McKinley, Otero, Roosevelt, Sandoval, San Juan, and Sierra counties, in addition to Ruidoso village adopted such laws. In 2019, the New Mexico Legislature approved legislation that prohibits local right-to-work laws and further states that union membership and the payment of union dues may be required as a condition of employment in workplaces subject to a collective bargaining agreement; it was signed by governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. In 2020, New Mexico&#x27;s legislature passed House Bill 364 that authorizes and promotes the use of card check protocols for workers considering organizing into a labor union. New Mexico does not currently require Project Labor Agreements for state-sponsored projects, but some local jurisdictions (notably Bernalillo County and the City of Albuquerque) have ordinances in place requiring Project Labor Agreements for locally-sponsored projects that exceed specified dollar-value thresholds.

<text>The Eighth Route Army (), officially known as the [[Eighth Route Army|18th Group Army ]] of the National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China, was a group army under the command of the Chinese Communist Party, nominally within the structure of the Chinese military headed by the Chinese Nationalist Party during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

The Eighth Route Army was created from the Chinese Red Army on September 22, 1937, when the Chinese Communists and Chinese Nationalists formed the Second United Front against Japan at the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, as the Chinese theater was known in World War II. Together with the New Fourth Army, the Eighth Route Army formed the main Communist fighting force during the war and was commanded by Communist party leader Mao Zedong and general Zhu De. Though officially designated the 18th Group Army by the Nationalists, the unit was referred to by the Chinese Communists and Japanese military as the Eighth Route Army. The Eighth Route Army wore Nationalist uniforms and flew the flag of the Republic of China and waged mostly guerrilla war against the Japanese, collaborationist forces and, later in the war, other Nationalist forces. The unit was renamed the People&#x27;s Liberation Army in 1947, after the end of World War II, as the Chinese Communists and Nationalists resumed the Chinese Civil War.

== History ==

The Eighth Route Army consisted of three divisions (the 115th, which was commanded by Lin Biao, the 120th under He Long, and the 129th under Liu Bocheng). During World War II, the Eighth Route Army operated mostly in North China, infiltrating behind Japanese lines, to establish guerrilla bases in rural and remote areas. The main units of the Eighth Route Army were aided by local militias organized from the peasantry.

After its fall 1938 victory in the Battle of Wuhan, Japan advanced deep into Communist territory and redeployed 50,000 troops to the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region. Elements of the Eighth Route Army soon attacked the advancing Japanese, inflicting between 3,000 and 5,000 casualties and resulting in a Japanese retreat.

The Communist Party&#x27;s liaison offices in cities under Nationalist control such as Chongqing, Guilin and Dihua (Ürümqi) were called Eighth Route Army Offices.

Ethnic Koreans who fought in the Eighth Route Army later joined the Korean People&#x27;s Army.

In the Yan&#x27;an base area in September 1938, the Eighth Route Army established its first film group.

The Eighth Route Army was also responsible for the reeducation of Japanese POWs, and defectors during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In November 1940, the General Political Department of the Eighth Route Army established the Yan&#x27;an Japanese Worker and Peasant School. On May 15, 1941, the school was officially opened at Baota Mountain, Yan&#x27;an.

Several notable Japanese soldiers joined the Eighth Route Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Including Hideo Miyagawa, Kobayashi Kancho, and Maeda Mitsushige, the first Japanese to join the Eighth Route Army during the war.

In October 1941, 35 Japanese in Yenan, including Oyama Mitsuyoshi, took an oath to officially join the Eighth Route Army.

== Organization ==
=== 1937 ===

<doc id="392211" wikidata="Q7996770" url="?curid=392211" title="Whitney v. California">
<text>Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927), was a United States Supreme Court decision upholding the conviction of an individual who had engaged in speech that raised a clear and present danger to society. While the majority of the Supreme Court Justices voted to uphold the conviction, the ruling has become an important free speech precedent due a concurring opinion by Justice Louis Brandeis recommending new perspectives on criticism of the government by citizens. The ruling was explicitly overruled by &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot; in 1969.

==Background==
Anita Whitney, a member of a distinguished California family, was convicted under the 1919 California Criminal Syndicalism Act for allegedly helping to establish the Communist Labor Party of America, a group accused by the state of advocating the violent overthrow of the American government. Whitney was arrested in November 1919 after giving a speech in Oakland to attract financial support for the California chapter of the party. 

Whitney denied that it had been the intention of her or other organizers for the party to become an instrument of violence. In February 1920, Whitney was tried at the Alameda County Superior Court and was found guilty of four counts of criminal syndicalism. She was sentenced to one to fourteen years at San Quentin Penitentiary, but was released after eleven days upon posting a bond and presenting evidence of poor health. Whitney attempted several appeals within the California state court system, arguing against the applicability of the state&#x27;s 1919 statute, but without success. Her petition to the California Supreme Court was denied. Whitney then adopted an argument based on the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, claiming that her speech was punished differently than the speech of others due to the subject matter. Whitney petitioned to the United States Supreme Court to review her criminal conviction, and the high court agreed to hear the case in March 1926. 

==Supreme Court ruling==
The question before the court was whether the Criminal Syndicalism Act in California violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court unanimously upheld Whitney&#x27;s criminal conviction, with seven Justices joining the majority opinion and two issuing a concurring opinion. Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the majority opinion citing the clear and present danger test that had been developed by Oliver Wendell Holmes in &quot;Schenck v. U.S.&quot; (1919), holding that Whitney&#x27;s speech in Oakland justified a police response under that test. 

Sanford expanded the clear and present danger test to address the specific circumstances and content of Whitney&#x27;s criminal conviction. The court held that the state, in exercising its police power, has the power to punish those who abuse their rights to freedom of speech &quot;by utterances inimical to the public welfare, tending to incite crime, disturb the public peace, or endanger the foundations of organized government and threaten its overthrow.&quot; In other words, speech with a &quot;bad tendency&quot; can be punished. Thus, the state&#x27;s police power toward this type of speech did not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. Whitney&#x27;s criminal conviction was upheld.

===Brandeis&#x27;s concurrence ===
Since the main question before the Supreme Court involved possible violations of the Fourteenth Amendment, Justices Louis Brandeis and Oliver Wendell Holmes voted with the majority on that question but considered the unintended ramifications for free speech. Brandeis wrote a concurring opinion, joined by Holmes, that many scholars have lauded as perhaps the greatest defense of freedom of speech ever written by a member of the Supreme Court. 

Brandeis deviated significantly from prevailing judicial thought on the First Amendment, and applied free speech to the democratic process. He held that citizens have an obligation to take part in the governing process, and they cannot do so unless they can discuss and criticize governmental policy fully and without fear. If the government can punish unpopular views, it cramps freedom. In the long run, that will strangle democratic processes. Thus, free speech is not only an abstract virtue but also a key element at the heart of a democratic society. 

Brandeis also suggested a reappraisal of the prevailing clear and present danger test, and insisted on what some have called a &quot;time to answer&quot; test: no danger flowing from speech can be considered &quot;clear and present&quot; if there is full opportunity for discussion. Brandeis argued that governments, while having a right to curb truly dangerous expression, must clearly define the nature of that danger. Mere fear of unpopular ideas will not do. In Brandeis&#x27;s words: 

==Impact and subsequent events==
Shortly after the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling, Anita Whitney was pardoned by the Governor of California based on Justice Brandeis&#x27; concurring opinion. Philippa Strum, oft the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, asserted that Whitney was a pacifist who believed in working within the American political system. Whitney was, in effect, put on trial for her association with labor groups as well as her own reform activities, which included fighting for equality and advocating for a more equitable political and economic system.

Brandeis&#x27;s concurrence in the &quot;Whitney&quot; ruling eventually became more influential than the majority opinion, and hinted toward the rejection of the clear and present danger test. This indeed happened by the 1950s–60s, as the American judiciary transitioned to a focus on the risk of imminent lawless action caused by speech that government officials find inappropriate. This doctrine was solidified by the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot; in 1969, which explicitly overturned &quot;Whitney v. California&quot; as a precedent. Constitutional experts have called Brandeis&#x27;s concurrence a &quot;milestone&quot; for free speech jurisprudence, that upholds &quot;the basic stanchion of our society.&quot;

<text>A polyp is an abnormal growth of tissue projecting from a mucous membrane. If it is attached to the surface by a narrow elongated stalk, it is said to be &quot;pedunculated&quot;; if it is attached without a stalk, it is said to be &quot;sessile&quot;. 

Polyps are commonly found in the colon, stomach, nose, ear, sinus(es), urinary bladder, and uterus. They may also occur elsewhere in the body where there are mucous membranes, including the cervix, vocal folds, and small intestine. Some polyps are tumors (neoplasms) and others are non-neoplastic, for example hyperplastic or dysplastic, which are benign. The neoplastic ones are usually benign, although some can be pre-malignant, or concurrent with a malignancy.

The name is of ancient origin, in use in English from about 1400 for a nasal polyp, from Latin through Greek. The animal of similar appearance called polyp is attested from 1742, although the word was earlier used for an octopus.

== Digestive polyps ==
Relative incidences by location:


===Colorectal polyp===

While colon polyps are not commonly associated with symptoms, occasionally they may cause rectal bleeding, and on rare occasions pain, diarrhea or constipation. They are a concern because of the potential for colon cancer being present microscopically, and the risk of benign colon polyps becoming malignant over time. Since most polyps are asymptomatic, they are usually discovered at the time of colon cancer screening. Common screening methods are occult blood test, colonoscopy with a modern flexible endoscope, sigmoidoscopy (usually with the older rigid endoscope), lower gastrointestinal series (barium enema), digital rectal examination (DRE), virtual colonoscopy or Cologuard. 

The polyps are routinely removed at the time of colonoscopy, either with a wire loop known as a polypectomy snare (first description by P. Deyhle, Germany, 1970), or with biopsy forceps. If an adenomatous polyp is found, it must be removed, since such a polyp is pre-cancerous and has a propensity to become cancerous. For certainty, all polyps which are found by any diagnostic modality, are removed by a colonoscopy. Although colon cancer is usually not found in polyps smaller than 2.5 cm, all polyps found are removed since their removal reduces the likelihood of future colon cancer. When adenomatous polyps are removed, a repeat colonoscopy is usually performed three to five years later.

Most colon polyps can be categorized as sporadic.

===Inherited polyposis syndromes===

* Familial adenomatous polyposis
* Peutz–Jeghers syndrome
* Turcot syndrome
* Juvenile polyposis syndrome
* Cowden disease
* Bannayan–Riley–Ruvalcaba syndrome (Bannayan–Zonana syndrome)
* Gardner&#x27;s syndrome
* Serrated polyposis syndrome

===Non-inherited polyposis syndromes===
* Cronkhite–Canada syndrome

===Types of colon polyps===
* Malignant
* Hamartomatous
* Hyperplastic
* Inflammatory: Inflammatory fibroid polyp

===Adenomatous polyps===
Adenomatous polyps, or adenomas, are polyps that grow on the lining of the colon and which carry a high risk of cancer. The adenomatous polyp is considered pre-malignant, i.e., likely to develop into colon cancer. The other types of polyps that can occur in the colon are hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps, which are unlikely to develop into colorectal cancer.

About 5% of people aged 60 will have at least one adenomatous polyp of 1 cm diameter or greater. Multiple adenomatous polyps often result from familial polyposis coli or familial adenomatous polyposis, a condition that carries a very high risk of colon cancer.

====Types====
Adenomas constitute approximately 10% of digestive polyps. Most polyps (approximately 90%) are small, usually less than 1 cm in diameter, and have a small potential for malignancy. The remaining 10% of adenomas are larger than 1 cm and approach a 10% chance of containing invasive cancer.

There are three types of adenomatous polyp:
* Tubular adenomas (tube-like shape) are the most common of the adenomatous polyps; they may occur everywhere in the colon and they are the least likely colon polyps to develop into colon cancer
* Tubulovillous
* Villous adenomas are commonly found in the rectal area and they are normally larger in size than the other two types of adenomas. They tend to be non-pedunculated, velvety, or cauliflower-like in appearance and they are associated with the highest morbidity and mortality rates of all polyps. They can cause hypersecretory syndromes characterized by hypokalemia and profuse mucous discharge, and can harbor carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma more frequently than other adenomas.

====Risks====
The risks of progression to colorectal cancer increase if the polyp is larger than 1 cm and contains a higher percentage of villous component. Also, the shape of the polyps is related to the risk of progression into carcinoma. Polyps that are pedunculated (with a stalk) are usually less dangerous than sessile polyps (flat polyps). Sessile polyps have a shorter pathway for migration of invasive cells from the tumor into submucosal and more distant structures, and they are also more difficult to remove and ascertain. Sessile polyps larger than 2 cm usually contain villous features, have a higher malignant potential, and tend to recur following colonoscopic polypectomy.

Although polyps do not carry significant risk of colon cancer, tubular adenomatous polyps may become cancerous when they grow larger. Larger tubular adenomatous polyps have an increased risk of malignancy when larger because then they develop more villous components and may become sessile.

It is estimated that an individual whose parents have been diagnosed with an adenomatous polyp has a 50% greater chance to develop colon cancer than individuals with no family history of colonic polyps. there is no way to establish the risks of colon polyps of patients with a family history of them. Overall, nearly 6% of the population, regardless of family history, is at risk of developing colon cancer.

====Screening====
Screening for colonic polyps as well as preventing them has become an important part of the management of the condition. Medical societies have established guidelines for colorectal screening in order to prevent adenomatous polyps and to minimize the chances of developing colon cancer. It is believed that some changes in the diet might be helpful in preventing polyps from occurring, but there is no other way to prevent the polyps from developing into cancerous growths than detecting and removing them.

Colon polyps as they grow can sometimes cause bleeding within the intestine, which can be detected by an occult blood test. According to American Cancer Society guidelines, people over 50 should have an annual occult blood test. People in their 50s are recommended to have flexible sigmoidoscopies performed once every 3 to 5 years to detect any abnormal growth which could be an adenomatous polyp. If adenomatous polyps are detected during this procedure, a colonoscopy is recommended. Medical societies recommend colonoscopies every ten years starting at age 50 as a necessary screening practice for colon cancer. The screening provides an accurate image of the intestine and also allows the removal of the polyp, if found. 

Once an adenomatous polyp is identified during colonoscopy, there are several methods of removal, including using a snare or a heating device. Colonoscopies are preferred over sigmoidoscopies because they allow the examination of the entire colon and can detect polyps in the upper colon, where more than half of polyps occur.

It has been statistically demonstrated that screening programs are effective in reducing the number of deaths caused by colon cancer due to adenomatous polyps. The risk of complications associated with colonoscopies is approximately 0.35 percent, compared to a lifetime risk of developing colon cancer of around 6 percent. As there is a small likelihood of recurrence, surveillance after polyp removal is recommended.

==Endometrial polyp==

An endometrial polyp or uterine polyp is a polyp or lesion in the lining of the uterus (endometrium) that takes up space within the uterine cavity. Commonly occurring, they are experienced by up to 10% of women. They may have a large flat base (sessile) or be attached to the uterus by an elongated (pedunculated). Pedunculated polyps are more common than sessile ones. They range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. If pedunculated, they can protrude through the cervix into the vagina. Small blood vessels may be present in polyps, particularly large ones.

==Cervical polyp==

A cervical polyp is a common benign polyp or tumor on the surface of the cervical canal. They can cause irregular menstrual bleeding or increased pain but often show no symptoms.

==Nasal polyps==

Nasal polyps are polypoidal masses arising mainly from the mucous membranes of the nose and paranasal sinuses. They are overgrowths of the mucosa that frequently accompany allergic rhinitis. They are freely movable and nontender.

==Laryngeal polyps==
Polyps on the vocal folds can take on many different forms, and can sometimes result from vocal abuse, although this is not always the cause. They can occur on one or both vocal folds, and appear as swelling, a bump (similar to a nodule), a stalk-like growth, or a blister-like lesion. Most polyps are larger than nodules, which are more similar to callouses on the vocal folds. Polyps and nodules can exhibit similar symptoms including hoarseness or breathiness, &quot;rough&quot; or &quot;scratchy&quot; voice, harshness in vocal quality, shooting pain from ear to ear, sensation of having &quot;a lump in the back of the throat&quot;, neck pain, decreased pitch range in the voice, and vocal and bodily fatigue.

If an individual experiences symptoms for more than 2 to 3 weeks, they should see a physician. For a diagnosis, a thorough evaluation of the voice should include a physical examination, preferably by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat doctor) who specializes in voice, a voice evaluation with a speech-language pathologist (SLP), a neurological examination (in certain cases)
The qualities of the voice that will be evaluated include quality, pitch, loudness, and ability to sustain voicing. In some cases, an instrumental examination may be performed with an endoscope into the mouth or nose; this gives a clear look at the vocal folds and larynx in general. In addition to this, a stroboscope (flashing light) may be used to observe the movement of the vocal folds during speech.

Polyps may be treated with medical, surgical, or behavioral intervention. Surgical intervention involves removing the polyp from the vocal fold. This approach is only used when the growth(s) are very large or have existed for an extended amount of time. In children, surgical intervention is rare. Existing medical problems may be treated in an effort to reduce the strain and negative impact on the vocal cords. This could include treatment for gastrointestinal reflux disease, allergies, and thyroid problems. Intervention to stop smoking and reduce stress may also be needed. Most people receive behavioral intervention, or vocal therapy, from an SLP. This might involve teaching good vocal hygiene, and reducing or stopping vocal abuse behaviors. Direct voice treatments may be used to alter pitch, loudness, or breathe support to promote good voicing.

<doc id="392216" wikidata="Q5930071" url="?curid=392216" title="Two-finger salute">
<text>The two-finger salute is a salute given using only the middle and index fingers, while bending the other fingers at the second knuckle, and with the palm facing the signer. This salute is used by the Polish Armed Forces, other uniformed services in Poland, and, in some countries, the Cub Scouts.

==Two-finger salute in Poland==

The Polish two-finger salute is only used while wearing a headdress with the emblem of the Polish eagle (such as military hat rogatywka) or without this emblem (such as Boonie hat or helmet). The salute is performed with the middle and index fingers extended and touching each other, while the ring and little fingers are bent and touched by the thumb. The tips of the middle and index fingers touch the peak of the cap, the two fingers have been interpreted as &quot;honour&quot; and &quot;fatherland&quot; (&quot;Honor i Ojczyzna&quot;).

It is not clear when the two-fingers salute appeared in Polish military forces. Some see its origin in Tadeusz Kościuszko&#x27;s 1794 oath. Others state that it came from Polish soldiers in the Congress Kingdom army around 1815 (partitioned Poland). At that time, the Tsar&#x27;s Viceroy in Poland, Grand Duke Constantine, said that Poles would salute him with two fingers and use the other two to hold a stone to throw at him. Another legend attributes the salute to the remembrance of Battle of Olszynka Grochowska in 1831, when a soldier, who had lost in the battle all his fingers but the middle and index ones, saluted his superior with the wounded hand and died after it.

During the Second World War the salute was a subject of some controversy, as most of the Allied officers were unfamiliar with the gesture and saw it as disrespectful. Polish soldiers serving in the British Army were ordered to use an open palm salute instead.

==Cub Scouting==
Many Cub Scout sections also use a two-finger salute. The salute was devised by Robert Baden-Powell and originally represented the two ears of a wolf cub, since the original programme was based on Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. However, Cubs in several national associations now use the three-finger Scout salute used by the rest of the Scout Movement.

<doc id="392217" wikidata="Q559756" url="?curid=392217" title="Dragan Čović">
<text>Dragan Čović (; born 20 August 1956) is a Bosnian Croat politician who served as the 4th Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2002 to 2005 and from 2014 to 2018. He is the current president of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ BiH) and has been serving as a member of the national House of Peoples since 2019, having previously served from 2011 to 2014.

Born in Mostar, Čović graduated from the Faculty of Engineering at University Džemal Bijedić in his hometown in 1979. He also attended studies at the University of Sarajevo and holds a PhD from the University of Mostar, obtaining it in 1996. Prior to the Bosnian War, Čović worked as a manager at Yugoslav aircraft manufacturer SOKO. He entered into politics by joining the HDZ BiH in 1994, becoming its president in 2005. As president of the HDZ BiH, he took part in many constitutional reform talks, most notably in those regarding the Prud Agreement between 2008 and 2009, and in the 2010–2012 government formation.

Earlier in his career, Čović served as Federal Minister of Finance from 1998 to 2001 and was the acting Federal Prime Minister in 2001. At the 2002 general election, Čović was elected Croat member of the Bosnian Presidency, serving as its member until 2005, when he was removed from office by High Representative Paddy Ashdown, for abuse of power and position. After serving a term in the national House of Peoples from 2011 to 2014, he was once again elected Croat member of the Presidency at the 2014 general election. Čović served as a member until 2018, after losing his bid for re-election at the 2018 general election. Since 2019, he has again been serving as a member of the national House of Peoples.

In November 2006, Čović was sentenced to five years in prison for exempting the Ivanković-Lijanović company of paying taxes on meat imports. The Bosnian Court, on appeal, annulled the sentence and acquitted him for lack of jurisdiction. In 2009, he was accused of spending public funds to buy private homes for certain people. In April 2010, he was acquitted. In May 2010, a third indictment for Čović and six other persons was confirmed by the Court of the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton, this time for abuse of power and position. In May 2012, he was acquitted.

==Education and managerial career==
Čović attended elementary school and technical high school of mechanical engineering in Mostar until 1975. He graduated as a mechanical engineer from the Faculty of Engineering at the University Džemal Bijedić of Mostar in 1979.

In 1980, he joined the aircraft manufacturer SOKO in Mostar, where he worked in the technology and control sections. From 1986 to 1992, Čović was a manager at SOKO, including as director of business unit, director of production and vice president for industrialization. From 1992 until 1998, he took over as director-general of SOKO.

Čović gained a master&#x27;s degree in 1989 at the Faculty of Engineering in Mostar, and, from 1989 to 1991, he attended studies of management at the Faculty of Economy at the University of Sarajevo. He obtained a PhD from the University of Mostar in 1996.

From 1994 to 1996, he taught Economics and Organization of Production as a senior assistant at the Faculty of Engineering in Mostar, after which he was named assistant professor and taught Development of Production Systems. Four years later, Čović became an associate professor and in 2004 he was a full professor at the University of Mostar. He worked at the Faculty of Economy in Mostar, and also in regular and postgraduate studies. In 2007, he became visiting professor at the University of Mostar&#x27;s Faculty of Philosophy, and in 2014 member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Early political career==
In 1994, Čović joined the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ BiH). Two years later, he became a member of the cantonal committee of the HDZ BiH. In 1997, he became the president of the city committee of the HDZ BiH in Mostar.

In 1998, Čović became vice president of the HDZ BiH, while in 2002, he became the party&#x27;s presidency member. In 2005, he was elected HDZ BiH president. From 1998 to 2001, Čović served as the Federal Minister of Finance. From 10 January 2001 to 12 March 2001, he served as Acting Prime Minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, succeeding the Party of Democratic Action&#x27;s Edhem Bičakčić. Čović served as Acting Prime Minister for two months, before he himself was succeeded by Alija Behmen of the Social Democratic Party.

==First presidency (2002–2005)==
At the 2002 general election, Čović was elected member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina with 114,606 votes. He served as Presidency member until 29 March 2005, when he was removed from office by the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Paddy Ashdown, for abuse of power and position.

==Post-presidency (2005–2014)==
Since 2005, Čović has been President of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ BiH).

In May 2011, he became a member of the national House of Peoples and in February 2012, he was named Chairman of the House of Peoples. Čović would chair the House once more in 2014. In 2011, he was also appointed President of the Croatian National Assembly.

During the numerous failed negotiations to implement the 2009 ECtHR Sejdić-Finci judgment, Čović has been singled out by analysts as blocking a solution, maintaining that Bosnian Croats must be able to elect their own member in the Presidency.

===Prud Agreement===
Together with the leaders of the three most important &#x27;nationalist&#x27; political parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who acted as representatives of the constituent peoples, Milorad Dodik of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) and Sulejman Tihić of the Party of Democratic Action, Čović created the &quot;Prud Agreement&quot; or &quot;Prud Process&quot;, an agreement that pertained to state property, census, constitutional changes, reconstructing the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and solving the legal status of Brčko District. The agreement was created in the village of Prud on 8 November 2008. The reforms promised by the agreement would &quot;build the ability of the State to meet the requirements of the EU integration process&quot;.

At a subsequent meeting in Banja Luka on 26 January 2009, the party leaders set out a plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina as a decentralized country with three levels of government. The middle level of government was anticipated to be made up of four territorial units with legislative, executive and judicial branches of government.

Controversy surrounded the creation of a third entity, Republika Srpska’s territorial integrity, and the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

A further meeting was held in Mostar on 23 February 2009, hosted by Čović.

On 20 July 2009, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Valentin Inzko suggested that the process between the three &#x27;nationalist&#x27; parties had effectively ended. Instead, it had changed into a process involving many more political parties. Inzko believed that minor-level constitutional reform could be delivered through the meetings.

When the Prud process failed, Milorad Dodik and his SNSD party became close partners to Čović&#x27;s HDZ BiH party.

===2010–2012 government formation===

Following the 2010 general election, a process of formation of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s Council of Ministers (i.e. the national government) began. The resulting election produced a fragmented political landscape without a coalition of a parliamentary majority more than a year after the election. The centre-left Social Democratic Party (SDP BiH), and the Bosnian Serb autonomist SNSD, each had 8 MPs of the total 42 MPs of the House of Representatives.

The major Croat (HDZ BiH and HDZ 1990) and Serb parties (SNSD and SDS) contended that a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement existed in which the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers rotates between the three constitutional nationalities. In this case, it would be the turn of a Croat politician to chair the Council. As the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ BiH), led by Čović, and the Croatian Democratic Union 1990 (HDZ 1990) received the overwhelming share of Croat votes at the 2010 general election, the parties demanded that a member of one of them receive the position of Chairman. The SDP BiH on the other hand, claimed that the only necessity is the ethnicity of the individual, and not the party, demanding the right to appoint a Croat Chairman from SDP BiH ranks, calling upon the right of having assumed most votes nationwide.

The European Union and the Office of the High Representative repeatedly attempted negotiations to appease the Bosniak–Bosnian and Serb–Croat divided political blocs, in parallel to the Bosnian constitutional crisis, all ending in failure. The Bosniak-Bosnian coalition insisted that the seat would have to go to them as the party that received the largest number of votes, while the Serb–Croat alliance insisted that due to the fact that according to tradition, the next Chairman of the Council of Ministers must be an ethnic Croat, it must come from an authentic Croat party (Croatian Democratic Union), and not the multi-ethnic SDP BiH.

A round of talks between party leaders was held in Mostar on 5 September 2011, hosted by Croat politicians Božo Ljubić and Čović, with Milorad Dodik, Mladen Bosić, Sulejman Tihić and Zlatko Lagumdžija in attendance. The parties agreed to a further round of discussion in mid-September. A meeting between the six major party leaders was held in Sarajevo on 15 September, hosted by Zlatko Lagumdžija. Topics discussed at the meeting included holding a national census, military assets and the Sejdić-Finci ruling. On the same day, an EU spokesperson warned that the country risked losing funding through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance if the political situation did not stabilize. Another meeting on 26 September 2011 failed as well.

An agreement was finally reached on 28 December 2011 between the six political parties: the Social Democratic Party, the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), the Croatian Democratic Union, the Croatian Democratic Union 1990, the Serb Democratic Party and the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats. Vjekoslav Bevanda, a Bosnian Croat, became the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

===Constitutional reform===

As “credible efforts” towards the implementation of the Sejdić–Finci ruling remained the outstanding condition for the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, in June 2012, Czech Commissioner Štefan Füle launched a High Level Dialogue on the Accession Process (HLAD) with Bosnia and Herzegovina, tackling both the Sejdić–Finci issue and the need for a coordination mechanism for the country to speak with a single voice in the accession process. Talks were held in June and November 2012, with little success.

In the summer of 2012, Čović and SDP BiH leader Lagumdžija agreed on the indirect election of the Bosnian Presidency members by the Bosnian Parliament, but the deal was not turned into detailed amendments. The HDZ BiH kept calling for electoral reform to prevent new Komšić cases. The same Željko Komšić left the SDP BiH, in dissent with the agreement which would have excluded him from acceding to power again. The SDA also opposed it, as it would have created a further asymmetry, with one Presidency member (from Republika Srpska) elected directly, and two elected indirectly.

In February 2013, the European Commission decided to step up its involvement, with the direct facilitation of talks by Füle, in coordination with the Council of Europe&#x27;s Secretary-General Thorbjørn Jagland. In March and April 2013, with the support of the Director-General for Enlargement Stefano Sannino, the EU Delegation in Sarajevo facilitated a series of direct talks between party leaders, with no concrete outcome.

During the summer of 2013, Čović and Bosnian Presidency member Bakir Izetbegović reached a political agreement on several files, from Mostar to Sejdić–Finci, in parallel to the initiative led by the U.S. Embassy for a constitutional reform of the Federal entity. An agreement on principles on how to solve the Sejdić–Finci issue was signed by political leaders in Brussels on 1 October 2013, but it evaporated right after. Three further rounds of negotiations among political leaders were led together with Štefan Füle, in a castle near Prague in November 2013, and later in Sarajevo in the first months of 2014, also with the presence of the U.S. and the Venice Commission. Despite high hopes, a solution could not be found, as the HDZ BiH required the absolute arithmetical certainty of being able to occupy the third seat of the Bosnian Presidency – which, given that the Sejdić–Finci ruling was actually about removing ethnic discrimination in the access to the same Presidency, could not be provided by any possible model. Talks were ended on 17 February 2014, while popular protests were ongoing in Sarajevo and in the rest of the country.

==Second presidency (2014–2018)==
At the 2014 general election, Čović was re-elected as Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He chaired the Presidency between November 2015 and March 2016, during which period on 15 February 2016, Bosnia and Herzegovina submitted its EU membership application. Čović held again the chair of the Presidency in the July–November 2017 period.

On 7 June 2015, he met with Pope Francis in Sarajevo, as part of the Popes&#x27;s 2015 papal visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

At the 2018 general election, Čović lost his bid for re-election as Croat member of the Bosnian Presidency to Željko Komšić (former member of the Presidency from 2006 until 2014). He and the HDZ BiH accused Komšić of garnering support from Bosniak rather than Croat voters and thus not being a legitimate representative of Bosnian Croats in the country&#x27;s Presidency.

==Investigations and indictments==
In November 2006, Čović was sentenced to five years in prison for exempting the Ivanković-Lijanović company from paying taxes on meat imports. The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, on appeal, annulled the sentence and acquitted him for lack of jurisdiction.

In 2009, Čović was accused of spending public funds to buy private homes for certain people. In April 2010, he was acquitted.

On 14 May 2010, a third indictment for Čović and six other persons was confirmed by the Court of the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton, this time for abuse of power and position. He and other committee members of the Croatian Post and Telecom (HPT) were accused of transferring a debt of nearly 4,7 million convertible marks from the non-existing Ministry of Defence of the Croatian Defence Council to three private companies. By receiving the debt, those three companies became owners of shares in HT Eronet, the most profitable telecommunicational section of the HPT. At the time, Čović was Federal Minister of Finance and president of the Steering Committee of the HPT. The Court of the HNC asked that this case be brought in front of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the Federal Supreme Court ruled the case had to be tried in Mostar. In May 2012, Čović was acquitted.

In March 2021, Čović was sanctioned by the Conflict of Interest Commission of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a reduction of 10% of his parliamentary salary for violation of the Law on Conflict of Interest, as in 2017 he received double compensation, both as a member of the national House of Peoples and of the Croatian National Assembly.

==Personal life==
Čović is married to Bernardica Prskalo and together they have two children.

On 19 July 2020, it was confirmed that he tested positive for COVID-19, amid its pandemic in Bosnia and Herzegovina; by 4 August, he had recovered.

<text>The president of Gabon () is the head of state of Gabon. A total of three people have served as president (not counting two acting presidents) since the post was formed in 1960.

The current transitional president, Brice Oligui Nguema, took power in a coup on 30 August 2023 from Ali Bongo.

==Description of the office==

===Election===
The president of the republic is elected for a presidential term of five (5) years, by universal and direct suffrage as per the 2023 Constitution amendement. The president is renewable. There was a two-term limit for the president in the Constitution of Gabon. This limit was lifted for Omar Bongo in 2003. 

The election is won by the candidate who obtains the largest number of votes.

All Gabonese citizens, male and female, who are at least forty (40) years old, have resided in Gabon for at least twelve (12) months, and who enjoy their full civil and political rights are eligible to run for the seat of the presidency.

The Constitutional Court may extend the provisioned time periods conforming to Article 11 below, but the elections may not take place more than thirty-five (35) days after the date of the decision of the Constitutional Court.

If an application of the policies in the present paragraphs postpones the election to a date beyond the last day in office of the current president, the president will remain in office until the election of the successor.

The ways and means by which the present article may be applied are fixed by organic law.

The presidential term begins on the day he presents himself for the presidential oath and finishes at the end of the seventh year following his election.

The election of the president of the republic takes place at least a month and at most two months before the end of the previous president&#x27;s term.

A current president may not shorten his or her term in any manner to run for another term.

If the current president of the republic runs for the next presidential term, the National Assembly of Gabon may not be dissolved. The president may also not exercise his power to legislate by ordinance from the moment he announces his candidacy up to the election. In cases of necessity, Parliament may convene in an extraordinary session.

===Oath of office===
The presidential oath marks the beginning of the presidential term. It may not take place before the Constitutional Court&#x27;s decision to proclaim the official election results.

At the moment of the president&#x27;s entry into office, the president of the republic will solemnly take the oath below, before the Parliament and the Constitutional Court, the left hand on the Constitution, and the other hand raised before the national flag:

===Vacancy===
In case of a vacancy of the presidential office for whatever reason, or a permanent impairment of the current president, affirmed by the Constitutional Court called upon by the government through an absolute majority of its members, or failing that, by the bureaus of the two chambers of Parliament with a majority of their members, the president of the Senate will temporarily exercise the duties of the president of the republic, or in case of permanent impairment of the president of the Senate, affirmed by the Constitutional Court called upon in the same conditions, the first vice-president of the Senate will temporarily carry out the duties of the presidential office.

The authority that assumes the presidential office in the interim will be temporarily invested with the full duties and powers of the president of the republic, to the exclusion of certain duties and powers provisioned by Articles 18, 19, and the first paragraph of 116. The temporary president may not present him or herself as a candidate of the next presidential election.

Before his or her entry into office, the authority concerned will take the oath of office according to the conditions of Article 12 above.

In the case of a vacancy, or if the president&#x27;s impairment is declared permanent by the Constitutional Court, the polls for the election of the new president, excluding cases of emergency announced by the Constitutional Court, will take place at least thirty (30) days or at most sixty (60) days after the beginning of the vacancy or the declaration of a permanent impairment of the president.

<text>Ignacy Oziewicz, pseudonyms: &quot;Czesław&quot;, &quot;Czesławski&quot;, &quot;Netta&quot;, &quot;Jenczewski&quot; (7 May 1887 – 10 January 1966) was a colonel of the Polish Army and a commandant of the National Armed Forces from 1942 to 1943.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and military career ===
Oziewicz was born on 7 May 1887 in the village of Linkmenys, near Švenčionys, Russian Empire (current Lithuania). After graduation from a Vilnius high school (1907), he voluntarily joined the Imperial Russian Army. In 1911, he graduated from a Military School in Vilna, and during World War I was an officer of the 103rd Infantry Regiment, part of 26th Infantry Division. Between April and October 1917, he served in 193rd Infantry Division, leaving the Russian army after the October Revolution. Between October 1917 and late 1918, Oziewicz managed real estate in Podolia.

In February 1919, Oziewicz joined the Polish Army. In October of that year, he was named commandant of 41st Infantry Regiment, and on 20 August 1920, he became commandant of 17th Infantry Regiment. In October 1925, he was named commandant of 76th Lida Infantry Regiment, stationed at Grodno. On 16 March 1927, President Ignacy Mościcki, upon a request of Minister of Military Affairs Józef Piłsudski, promoted him to Colonel. In 1935, Oziewicz was transferred to 16th Pomeranian Infantry Division, stationed in Grudziądz, where he commanded infantry. On 25 October 1938 he was appointed commandant of 29th Grodno Infantry Division.

=== World War II ===
During the 1939 German Invasion of Poland, he commanded the 29th Grodno Infantry Division. After breaking it, he managed to get to Lithuania, where he was interned. He escaped and returned to occupied Poland.

From 1941 to 1942, he was deputy of the Commander-in-Chief and head of the operational department of the National Military Organization (NOW). Oziewicz did not accept the decision to merge this organization with the Home Army (AK) because he considered it politically controlled by the Sanation. In the summer of 1942, he headed the split in NOW. He began to form the National Armed Forces (NSZ). On 20 September 1942, he became the first commandant of the NSZ.

He attempted to communicate with general Stefan Rowecki to include NSZ in the Home Army. On 9 June 1943, he was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned in Pawiak prison. In October of the same year, he was sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. In January 1945 he was evacuated to Flossenbürg concentration camp.

=== Post-war life ===
After being released by the United States Army in April 1945, Oziewicz was in Allied-occupied Germany. Then he moved to France, where he became active in Polish émigré social organizations. He was the representative of the NSZ community before the Home Army Verification Commission in London. In July 1949 he became the president of the &quot;Ogniwo&quot; organization founded in France.

In 1958 Oziewicz returned to the Poland. He settled with his family in Gdynia. He died in 1966, due to leukemia.

<text>Mireya Elisa Moscoso Rodríguez (born 1 July 1946) is a Panamanian politician who served as the President of Panama from 1999 to 2004. She is the country&#x27;s first and to date only female president.

Born into a rural family, Moscoso became active in the 1968 presidential campaign of three-time president Arnulfo Arias, following and marrying him when he went into exile after a military coup. After his death in 1988, she assumed control of his coffee business and later his political party, the Arnulfista Party (PA). During the 1994 general elections for the presidency, she narrowly lost to the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares by 4% of the vote. In the 1999 general election, she defeated the PRD candidate Martín Torrijos by 7% to become Panama&#x27;s first female president.

During her tenure in office, she presided over the handover of the Panama Canal from the US to Panama and the economic downturn that resulted from the loss of US personnel. Hobbled by new spending restrictions passed by the opposition-controlled Legislative Assembly, and her administration&#x27;s corruption scandals, she had difficulty passing her legislative initiatives. Her popularity declined, and her party&#x27;s candidate José Miguel Alemán lost to the PRD&#x27;s Torrijos in the subsequent general elections to succeed her.

== Background ==
Moscoso was born on 1 July 1946 into a poor family in Pedasí, Panama, as the youngest of six children. Her schoolteacher father died when she was ten, and Moscoso began working as a secretary upon completing her high school education. She joined the 1968 presidential campaign of Arnulfo Arias; Arias had already served two partial terms as president, both times being deposed by the Panamanian military. He won the presidency but was again deposed by the military, this time after only eleven days in office.

Arias went into exile in Miami, Florida, in the US, and Moscoso followed, marrying him the subsequent year. She was 23, and he was 67. During this period, Moscoso studied interior design at Miami-Dade Community College. After Arias&#x27; 1988 death, she inherited his coffee business. On 29 September 1991, almost two years after the US invasion of Panama that overthrew Manuel Noriega, she became president of her late husband&#x27;s Arnulfista Party.

Also in 1991, Moscoso married businessman Richard Gruber. The couple adopted a son, Ricardo (born 1992). Moscoso and Gruber divorced in 1997.

== Presidential campaigns ==
In 1994, Moscoso ran as the presidential candidate of her deceased husband&#x27;s Arnulfista Party (PA) in the general election, seeking to succeed PA president Guillermo Endara. Her main rivals were Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares and salsa singer Rubén Blades, who was then president of the party Papa Egoro. Moscoso and Blades sought to emphasize Pérez Balladares&#x27; connection with military ruler Manuel Noriega, broadcasting pictures of the two together, while Pérez Balladares worked to position himself as a successor to military ruler Omar Torrijos, who was regarded as a national hero. Moscoso&#x27;s campaign, meanwhile, was hindered by public dissatisfaction with the perceived incompetence and corruption of Endara&#x27;s government. Pérez Balladares ultimately won the election with 33% of the vote, with Moscoso receiving 29% and Blades receiving 17%.

Moscoso was named the PA candidate again in the 2 May 1999, general election. Her main opponent this time was Martín Torrijos, Omar Torrijos&#x27; son, named to represent the PRD after the failure of a constitutional referendum that would have allowed Pérez Balladares to run for a second term. Torrijos was selected in part to try to win back left-leaning voters after the privatizations and union restrictions instituted by Pérez Balladares. Moscoso ran on a populist platform, beginning many of her speeches with the Latin phrase &quot;Vox populi, vox Dei&quot; (&quot;the voice of the people is the voice of God&quot;), previously used by Arias to begin his own speeches. She pledged to support education, reduce poverty, and slow the pace of privatization. While Torrijos ran in large part on his father&#x27;s memory—including using the campaign slogan &quot;Omar lives&quot;—Moscoso evoked that of her dead husband, leading Panamanians to joke that the election was a race between &quot;two corpses&quot;. Torrijos allies also criticized Moscoso for her lack of government experience or college degree. However, unlike in 1994, it was now the PRD that was hampered by the scandals of the previous administration, and Moscoso defeated Torrijos with 45% of the vote to 37%.

==Presidency (1999–2004)==
Moscoso took office on 1 September 1999. Because she was divorced when she assumed the presidency, her older sister Ruby Moscoso de Young served as her First Lady.

Facing a PRD-controlled Legislative Assembly, Moscoso was limited in her ability to make new policy. She was also hampered by strict new restraints Pérez Balladares had passed on spending public money in the final days of his term, targeted specifically at her administration.

On 31 December 1999, Moscoso oversaw the handover of the Panama Canal from the US to Panama under the Torrijos–Carter Treaties. Her government then faced the challenge of cleaning up environmental problems in the Canal Zone, where the US Army had long tested bombs, biological agents, and chemical weapons. Remaining issues included lead contamination, unexploded munitions, and stockpiles of depleted uranium. Though Moscoso fired all of Pérez Balladares&#x27; appointments from the Panama Canal Authority and appointed supermarket magnate (and future president) Ricardo Martinelli as its head, the Authority retained its autonomy from her administration. At the same time, Panama&#x27;s economy began to struggle due to the loss of income from American canal personnel.

Moscoso worked to end Panama&#x27;s role in international crime, passing new laws against money laundering and supporting tax transparency. The legislation allowed Panama to be removed from international lists of tax havens. Meanwhile, violent crime rose sharply during Moscoso&#x27;s tenure. In September 2000, under pressure from the US and some Latin American governments, Moscoso&#x27;s government gave temporary asylum to former Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos, who had fled Peru after being videotaped bribing a member of its congress.

In December 2000, human remains were discovered at a Panamanian National Guard base, incorrectly believed to be those of Jesús Héctor Gallego Herrera, a priest murdered during the Omar Torrijos dictatorship. Moscoso appointed a truth commission to investigate the site and those at other bases. The commission faced opposition from the PRD-controlled National Assembly, who slashed its funding, and from PRD&#x27;s president Balbina Herrera, who threatened to seek legal action against the president for its creation. It ultimately reported on 110 of the 148 cases it examined, of which 40 had disappeared and 70 were known to be murdered. The report concluded that the Noriega government had engaged in &quot;torture [and] cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment&quot;, and recommended further exhumation and investigation.

During her term, Moscoso was often accused of nepotism for her administrative appointments and faced several corruption scandals, such as the unexplained gift of US$146,000 in watches to Legislative Assembly members. By 2001, her second year in office, Moscoso&#x27;s approval rating had fallen to 23%, due to corruption scandals and concern for the economy. That year, she attempted to pass a tax reform package through the Legislative Assembly, but the proposal was opposed by both the private sector and organized labor. In 2003, the US ambassador publicly criticized Moscoso for the growth of corruption during her term. By the end of her term, her presidency was &quot;criticized as rife with corruption and incompetence&quot; and &quot;widely regarded as weak and ineffectual&quot;.

She was criticized in 2004 when the press revealed that she had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at public expense on luxury clothing and jewelry during her presidency.

Herself barred by the Constitution of Panama from a second consecutive term, Moscoso was succeeded by her former rival Martín Torrijos in the 2004 election. Shortly before leaving office, Moscoso sparked controversy by pardoning four men—Luis Posada Carriles, Gaspar Jiménez, Pedro Remon, and Guillermo Novo Sampol—who had been convicted of plotting to assassinate Cuban president Fidel Castro during a 2000 visit to Panama. Cuba broke off diplomatic relations with the country, and Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez recalled the nation&#x27;s ambassador. Moscoso stated that the pardons had been motivated by her mistrust of Torrijos, saying, &quot;I knew that if these men stayed here, they would be extradited to Cuba and Venezuela, and there they were surely going to kill them there.&quot; Moscoso also issued pardons to 87 journalists for defamation convictions dating back as far as 14 years. On 2 July 2008, all of the 180 pardons Moscoso had issued were overturned as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

== Post-presidency ==
During the Torrijos presidency, Moscoso remained an active member of the opposition. In September 2007, she criticized the appointment as the head of the National Assembly of PRD politician Pedro Miguel González, who was wanted in the US for the murder of US Army sergeant Zak Hernández. In the same year, she joined Endara and Pérez Balladares in lobbying the Organization of American States to investigate the Hugo Chávez government&#x27;s refusal to renew the broadcasting license of opposition station Radio Caracas Televisión Internacional in Venezuela.

Since leaving office, Moscoso has also served as a member of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars&#x27; Council of Women World Leaders, a network intended &quot;to promote good governance and enhance the experience of democracy globally by increasing the number, effectiveness, and visibility of women who lead at the highest levels in their countries.&quot;

<doc id="392232" wikidata="Q845898" url="?curid=392232" title="List of heads of state of the Gambia">
<text>This is a list of the heads of state of The Gambia, from the independence of The Gambia in 1965 to the present day.

From 1965 to 1970 the head of state under the Constitution of 1965 was the queen of the Gambia, Elizabeth II, who was also the queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms. The monarch was represented in the Gambia by a governor-general. The Gambia became a republic within the Commonwealth under the Constitution of 1970 and the monarch and governor-general were replaced by an executive president.

==Monarch (1965–1970)==
The succession to the throne was the same as the succession to the British throne.

===Governor-general===
The governor-general was the representative of the monarch in the Gambia and exercised most of the powers of the monarch. The governor-general was appointed for an indefinite term, serving at the pleasure of the monarch. Since the Gambia was granted independence by the Gambia Independence Act 1964, rather than being first established as a semi-autonomous dominion and later promoted to independence as defined by the Statute of Westminster 1931, the governor-general was to be always appointed solely on the advice of the Cabinet of the Gambia without the involvement of the British government, with the sole exception of John Paul, the former colonial governor, who served as governor-general temporarily until he was replaced by Farimang Mamadi Singateh. In the event of a vacancy the chief justice would have served as the officer administering the government.

==Republic (1970–present)==
;Political parties


;Other factions

===First Republic (1970–1994)===
Under the Constitution of 1970, the first constitution of the Republic of the Gambia, the president replaced the monarch as executive head of state. The president was elected by the National Assembly for a five-year term. In the event of a vacancy the vice-president served as acting president.

===Military rule (1994–1996)===
Colonel Yahya Jammeh led a coup d&#x27;état which overthrew President Jawara and his government, all political parties and Parliament were dissolved.

===Second Republic (1996–present)===
Under the current constitution of the Republic of The Gambia, the president is executive head of state. The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term. In the event of a vacancy, the vice-president will serve as acting president.

<text>Zeppelin mail was mail carried on zeppelins, the German airships that saw civilian use from 1908 to 1939. Almost every zeppelin flight carried mail, sometimes in large quantities; the covers usually received special postmarks, and a number of nations issued postage stamps specifically intended for use on mail carried by the zeppelins.

== First period, 1908 to 1914 ==
The first zeppelin to carry mail was LZ 4, in July 1908, followed shortly by LZ 3. The early flights did not use any special markings; the first was an oval reading &quot;LUFTSCHIFF / SIGNALPOST&quot; around the edge and &quot;Z III&quot; in the center, used on LZ 6 (Z 3) from August to October 1909. By 1911 a number of different postmarks were in use; a typical example was a circle reading &quot;AN BORD DES / ZEPPELIN / LUFTSCHIFFES&quot;, with a date in the center and the name of the zeppelin at bottom. These were actually applied on board the zeppelin while in flight, at a small postal station.

The zeppelins were taken into military service in 1914, and thereafter did not carry civilian mail, although military commanders had special handstamps applied to their mail.

== Inter-war period, 1919 to 1939 ==
In late 1919, LZ 120 &quot;Bodensee&quot; resumed flights and mail carriage, using postmarks much as before the war, until 1921 when it was given to Italy as a war reparation. LZ 126 carried mail briefly in 1924 before it was delivered to the United States and renamed the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; (ZR-3). The &quot;Los Angeles&quot; carried mail between Lakehurst, New Jersey, Bermuda, and Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, several times.
LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; had a long and celebrated career. Within weeks of its first flight in September 1928, the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; carried the first airmail to go directly from Germany to the US and vice versa. Germany issued special 2-mark and 4-mark stamps for the occasion. On the return trip, the zeppelin carried almost 52,000 postcards and 50,000 letters. In 1929, &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; circled the globe, with stops in Tokyo and Los Angeles. By the time it was taken out of service in June 1937, the zeppelin had made 590 flights, each flight carrying up to 12 tons of mail to and from dozens of countries around the world.

Although LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot; is most famous for its fiery end, for the 14 months of its existence, it carried considerable amounts of mail overseas, and many of those are readily available today. Most of the 17,609 pieces of mail on the last flight were destroyed in the fire, but a handful were recovered, and today they are highly prized crash covers.

The LZ 130 &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot; was the last of the zeppelins to carry mail; it was in civilian service for only a few months, from October 1938 to August 1939, and made only 30 trips, all within Germany.

==Zeppelin stamps==

Zeppelin stamps were issued by a few countries to pay the postage for mail carried on Zeppelin flights during the late 1920s and early 1930s when Zeppelins flew passengers and mail from Germany to other countries and on return flights. Some stamps were regular issues overprinted while other were specially designed.

<text>Hao Lulu (, born 9 January 1979) is a Manchu Chinese woman who has become well known for having undergone extensive cosmetic surgery in 2003 to alter her appearance, tagged &quot;The Artificial Beauty&quot; ().

== Biography ==

=== Early years and education ===
Born in Beijing, Hao entered the China University of Geosciences in 1999. After graduation in 2001, she studied for a master&#x27;s degree in gemology in the United Kingdom until 2003.

=== Career ===
She became a freelance fashion writer briefly until July 19, 2003, to August 14, 2003, when she started a series of operations to modify her eyes, nose, chin, breasts, abdomen, buttocks, legs, and skin, at just 24 years old.

In before-and-after photographs widely circulated in the media, her appearance was indeed radically altered, in particular her eyes, which were given double eyelids to give her a more occidental appearance (see Asian blepharoplasty). The color of her skin was also lightened.

The transformation of Lulu, the &quot;Beauty Dreamwork Project&quot; (), was organized by EverCare (), a Beijing cosmetic surgery clinic, to promote its business, which had been languishing in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic. Evercare organized a press conference around Lulu to promote the company&#x27;s cosmetic surgery services. The clinic came out with numerous ads, that claimed they have the confidence and capacity to help Chinese women create new physiques through the use of advanced technologies and surgical skills. After her surgeries, Hào then worked as a spokesperson for the cosmetic surgery clinic that transformed her body.

The company&#x27;s actions have been criticized in China by doctors, who deplored it as a publicity stunt. However, it led to a great upsurge in interest in cosmetic surgery among China&#x27;s &quot;nouveau riche&quot;. After her transformation, news stories on body alternations increased tremendously in China&#x27;s mainstream media, marginalized tabloids, and cyberspace, from a number of different beauty companies.

== Diary ==
Hao&#x27;s diary, published on the clinic&#x27;s website, stated the pain and numbness she felt after certain procedures. She also constantly expressed her wish to go home tomorrow, where &quot;freedom&quot; is. In the second last entry, she concluded, however, that all pain is gone and that it was such a relief: &quot;How wonderful all these things are; I have no regret for my very first choice!&quot; ()

<doc id="392238" wikidata="Q193238" url="?curid=392238" title="Festus Mogae">
<text>Festus Gontebanye Mogae (born 21 August 1939) is a Motswana politician and economist who served as the third President of Botswana from 1998 to 2008. He succeeded Quett Masire as President in 1998 and was re-elected in October 2004. After ten years in office, he stepped down in 2008 and was succeeded by Lieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama.
==Biography==
===Early life===
Mogae studied economics in the United Kingdom, first at University College, Oxford, and then at the University of Sussex. He returned to Botswana to work as a civil servant before taking up posts with the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of Botswana. He later then served as the governor of Bank of Botswana from 1980 to 1981. He served as the Minister of Finance from 1989 to 1998. He was Vice-President of Botswana from 1991 to 1998.

===Presidency===
Mogae&#x27;s party, the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), retained power in the October 1999 general election, and Mogae was sworn in for a five-year term on 20 October 1999 by Chief Justice Julian Nganunu at the National Stadium in Gaborone. On this occasion, he vowed to focus on the fight against poverty and unemployment.

Following the BDP&#x27;s victory in the October 2004 general election, Mogae was sworn in for another term on 2 November 2004. Mogae promised to tackle poverty and unemployment, as well as the spread of HIV-AIDS, which he pledged to stop in Botswana by 2016.

On 14 July 2007, Mogae affirmed his intention to resign nine months later. He stepped down as President on 1 April 2008 and was succeeded by Vice-President Lieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama. He would have been required to leave office in 2008 in any event; a constitutional amendment passed in 1997 limited the president to a total of 10 years in office, whether successive or separated.

===Post-presidency===
Mogae currently serves as Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General on Climate Change. In 2010, he joined the advisory board of US nonprofit TeachAids. He also currently serves as chairman of the Choppies supermarket group where he earned Pula 529,000 in 2011.

In 2013, along with former President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Mogae co-chaired a sustainable development symposium, hosted by the UONGOZI Institute in collaboration with Club de Madrid, organisation of which Mkapa was also a member.

==Personal life==
Festus Mogae married Barbara Mogae in 1967. They have three daughters, born between 1969 and 1987: Nametso, Chedza and Boikaego.

==Honours and awards==

Mogae was awarded the Grand Cross of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; by French President Nicolas Sarkozy on 20 March 2008 for his &quot;exemplary leadership&quot; in making Botswana a &quot;model&quot; of democracy and good governance.

<text>Microtrauma is any of many possible small injuries to the body.

Microtrauma can include the microtearing of muscle fibres, the sheath around the muscle and the connective tissue. It can also include stress to the tendons, and to the bones (see Wolff&#x27;s law). It is unknown whether or not the ligaments adapt like this. Microtrauma to the skin (compression, impact, abrasion) can also cause increases in a skin&#x27;s thickness, as seen from the calluses formed from running barefoot or the hand calluses that result from rock climbing. This might be due to increased skin cell replication at sites under stress where cells rapidly slough off or undergo compression or abrasion.

Most microtrauma cause a low level of inflammation that cannot be seen or felt. These injuries can arise in muscle, ligament, vertebrae, and discs, either singly or in combination. Repetitive microtrauma which are not allowed time to heal can result in the development of more serious conditions.

== Negative effects ==
Back pain can develop gradually as a result of microtrauma brought about by repetitive activity over time. Because of the slow and progressive onset of this internal injury, the condition is often ignored until the symptoms become acute, often resulting in disabling injury. Acute back injuries can arise from stressful lifting techniques done without adequate recovery, especially when experimenting with more ballistic work, or work where the extensor spinae are stressed during spinal flexion when much of the load is commonly taken up by the slower to heal ligaments which may not adapt progressively to the stress. While the acute injury may seem to be caused by a single well-defined incident, it may have been preventable or lessened if not for the years of injury to the musculoskeletal support mechanism by repetitive microtrauma.

== Positive effects ==

After microtrauma from stress (such as lifting weights) to muscles, they can be rebuilt and overcompensate to reduce the likeliness of re-injury.

<text>Stefan Paweł Rowecki (pseudonym: &quot;Grot&quot;, &quot;Spearhead&quot;, hence the alternate name, Stefan Grot-Rowecki; 25 December 1895 – 2 August 1944) was a Polish general, journalist and the leader of the Armia Krajowa. He was murdered by the Gestapo in prison on the personal order of Heinrich Himmler.

==Life==

Rowecki was born in Piotrków Trybunalski. In his home town he was one of the organizers of a secret scouting organization. During World War I he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian army and later into the First Brigade of the Polish Legion. He was interned in August 1917 after the majority of his unit had refused to pledge loyalty to the Emperor of Austria. In February 1918, he was released from the internment camp in Beniaminów and joined the Polska Siła Zbrojna. After the establishment of the newly independent Poland, he joined the Polish Army.

Rowecki fought in the Polish–Soviet war (1919–1920). After the war, he remained in the army and organized the first military weekly periodical (&quot;Przegląd Wojskowy&quot;). From 1930 to 1935, he commanded the 55th Infantry Regiment in Leszno.

==World War II==

From June 1939, Rowecki organised the Warsaw Armoured Motorized Brigade (&quot;Warszawska Brygada Pancerno-Motorowa&quot;, 7TP, TKS tanks). On 1 September 1939 the Nazi-German Army invaded Poland. Although Rowecki&#x27;s unit did not reach full mobilization, it did, however, take part in the defense of Poland.

After the Polish defeat, Rowecki managed to avoid capture and returned to Warsaw. In October 1939, he became one of the leaders, then in 1940 commander, of the Union of Armed Struggle (ZWZ). In 1941, Rowecki organized sabotage in the territories east of the Polish pre-war borders &quot;Wachlarz&quot;. From 1942, he was commander of the Armia Krajowa (Home Army).

As commander of the Home Army, Rowecki instituted policies favorable to Jews. In February 1943, he ordered the Home Army to help the Jewish underground seeking to mount ghetto uprisings. In particular, Rowecki authorized aid to the Jewish underground in the Warsaw Ghetto before and during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising by providing arms and mounting diversionary attacks.

On 30 June 1943 he was arrested by the Gestapo in Warsaw and sent to Berlin. Rowecki was arrested due to his betrayal by Ludwik Kalkstein &quot;Hanka&quot;, Eugeniusz Świerczewski &quot;Genes&quot; and Blanka Kaczorowska &quot;Sroka&quot; who were Gestapo agents. All of them were members of the Home Army but in fact collaborated with the Gestapo. Swierczewski, Kalkstein and Kaczorowska were sentenced to death for high treason by the Secret War Tribunal of the Polish Secret State. The sentence on Eugeniusz Swierczewski was carried out by troops commanded by Stefan Rys (&quot;Jozef&quot;). Swierczewski was hanged in the basement of the house at 74 Krochmalna Street in Warsaw. Kalkstein received protection from the Gestapo and was not harmed. He fought in a Waffen SS unit during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 under the name of Konrad Stark. After the war, he worked for the Polish Radio station in Szczecin and was later recruited as an agent by the Urząd Bezpieczeństwa. In 1982, he emigrated to France; he died in 1994. Blanka Kaczorowska also survived the war. Her death sentence was not carried out because she was pregnant. After the war, she also worked as a secret agent for the Urząd Bezpieczeństwa and later for the renamed Służba Bezpieczeństwa. She emigrated to France in 1971. She died in 2002.

In Berlin he was imprisoned at Oranienburg and was questioned by many prominent Nazi officials (including Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Heinrich Himmler and Heinrich Müller). He was offered an anti-Bolshevik alliance, but refused. He was likely executed in August 1944 in Sachsenhausen. His execution was ordered by Heinrich Himmler.
There have been claims that the arrest of Rowecki on 30 June 1943 was a result of a wider intelligence operation against the Polish Underground State with the goal of eliminating top commanders and political leaders of the Polish resistance. During the same period, the Gestapo arrested the commander of National Armed Forces (NSZ), Colonel Ignacy Oziewicz on 9 June 1943. On 4 July 1943, General Władysław Sikorski died in a plane crash under mysterious circumstances. Within a period of two months, the Polish Army had lost three top commanders.

<doc id="392245" wikidata="Q552983" url="?curid=392245" title="Havelock Ellis">
<text>Henry Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 – 8 July 1939) was an English physician, eugenicist, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He co-wrote the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He developed the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis.

Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. He supported eugenics and served as one of 16 vice-presidents of the Eugenics Society from 1909 to 1912.

==Early life and career==
Ellis, son of Edward Peppen Ellis and Susannah Mary Wheatley, was born in Croydon, Surrey (now part of Greater London). He had four sisters, none of whom married. His father was a sea captain and an Anglican, while his mother was the daughter of a sea captain who had many other relatives that lived on or near the sea. When he was seven his father took him on one of his voyages, during which they called at Sydney, Australia; Callao, Peru; and Antwerp, Belgium. After his return, Ellis attended the French and German College near Wimbledon, and afterward attended a school in Mitcham.

In April 1875, Ellis sailed on his father&#x27;s ship for Australia; soon after his arrival in Sydney, he obtained a position as a master at a private school. After the discovery of his lack of training, he was fired and became a tutor for a family living a few miles from Carcoar, New South Wales. He spent a year there and then obtained a position as a master at a grammar school in Grafton, New South Wales. The headmaster had died and Ellis carried on at the school for that year, but was unsuccessful.

At the end of the year, he returned to Sydney and, after three months&#x27; training, was given charge of two government part-time elementary schools, one at Sparkes Creek, near Scone, New South Wales, and the other at Junction Creek. He lived at the school house on Sparkes Creek for a year. He wrote in his autobiography, &quot;In Australia, I gained health of body, I attained peace of soul, my life task was revealed to me, I was able to decide on a professional vocation, I became an artist in literature; these five points covered the whole activity of my life in the world. Some of them I should doubtless have reached without the aid of the Australian environment, scarcely all, and most of them I could never have achieved so completely if chance had not cast me into the solitude of the Liverpool Range.&quot;

==Medicine and psychology==
Ellis returned to England in April 1879. He had decided to take up the study of sex and felt his first step must be to qualify as a physician. He studied at St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital Medical School, now part of King&#x27;s College London, but never had a regular medical practice. His training was aided by a small legacy and also income earned from editing works in the Mermaid Series of lesser known Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. He joined The Fellowship of the New Life in 1883, meeting other social reformers Eleanor Marx, Edward Carpenter and George Bernard Shaw.

The 1897 English translation of Ellis&#x27;s book &quot;Sexual Inversion&quot;, co-authored with John Addington Symonds and originally published in German in 1896, was the first English medical textbook on homosexuality. It describes male homosexual relations. Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality, as he did not characterise it as a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age taboos as well as gender taboo. The work also uses the term bisexual throughout. The first edition of the book was bought-out by the executor of Symond&#x27;s estate, who forbade any mention of Symonds in the second edition.

In 1897 a bookseller was prosecuted for stocking Ellis&#x27;s book. Although the term &quot;homosexual&quot; is attributed to Ellis, he wrote in 1897, &quot;&#x27;Homosexual&#x27; is a barbarously hybrid word, and I claim no responsibility for it.&quot; In fact, the word &quot;homosexual&quot; was coined in 1868 by the Hungarian author Karl-Maria Kertbeny.

Ellis may have developed psychological concepts of autoeroticism and narcissism, both of which were later developed further by Sigmund Freud. Ellis&#x27;s influence may have reached Radclyffe Hall, who would have been about 17 years old at the time &quot;Sexual Inversion&quot; was published. She later referred to herself as a sexual invert and wrote of female &quot;sexual inverts&quot; in &quot;Miss Ogilvy Finds Herself&quot; and &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;. When Ellis bowed out as the star witness in the trial of &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; on 14 May 1928, Norman Haire was set to replace him but no witnesses were called.

===Eonism===
Ellis studied what today are called transgender phenomena. Together with Magnus Hirschfeld, Havelock Ellis is considered a major figure in the history of sexology to establish a new category that was separate and distinct from homosexuality. Aware of Hirschfeld&#x27;s studies of transvestism, but disagreeing with his terminology, in 1913 Ellis proposed the term &quot;sexo-aesthetic inversion&quot; to describe the phenomenon. In 1920 he coined the term &quot;eonism&quot;, which he derived from the name of a historical figure, the Chevalier d&#x27;Éon. Ellis explained:
Ellis found eonism to be &quot;a remarkably common anomaly&quot;, and &quot;next in frequency to homosexuality among sexual deviations&quot;, and categorized it as &quot;among the transitional or intermediate forms of sexuality&quot;. As in the Freudian tradition, Ellis postulated that a &quot;too close attachment to the mother&quot; may encourage eonism, but also considered that it &quot;probably invokes some defective endocrine balance&quot;.

== Marriage ==
In November 1891, at the age of 32, and reportedly still a virgin, Ellis married the English writer and proponent of women&#x27;s rights Edith Lees. From the beginning, their marriage was unconventional, as Lees was openly lesbian. At the end of the honeymoon, Ellis went back to his bachelor rooms in Paddington. She lived at a Fellowship House in Bloomsbury. Their &quot;open marriage&quot; was the central subject in Ellis&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot;. Ellis reportedly had an affair with Margaret Sanger.

According to Ellis in &quot;My Life&quot;, his friends were much amused at his being considered an expert on sex. Some knew that he reportedly suffered from impotence until the age of 60, when he discovered that he could become aroused by the sight of a woman urinating. Ellis named this &quot;undinism&quot;. After his wife died, Ellis formed a relationship with a French woman, Françoise Lafitte (better known as Françoise Delisle).

==Eugenics==

Ellis was a supporter of eugenics. He served as vice-president to the Eugenics Education Society and wrote on the subject, among others, in &quot;The Task of Social Hygiene&quot;:

In his early writings, it was clear that Ellis concurred with the notion that there was a system of racial hierarchies, and that non-western cultures were considered to be &quot;lower races&quot;. Before explicitly talking about eugenic topics, he used the prevalence of homosexuality in these &#x27;lower races&#x27; to indicate the universality of the behavior. In his work, &quot;Sexual Inversions&quot;, where Ellis presented numerous cases of homosexuality in Britain, he was always careful to mention the race of the subject and the health of the person&#x27;s &#x27;stock&#x27;, which included their neuropathic conditions and the health of their parents. However, Ellis was clear to assert that he did not feel that homosexuality was an issue that eugenics needed to actively deal with, as he felt that once the practice was accepted in society, those with homosexual tendencies would comfortably choose not to marry, and thus would cease to pass the &#x27;homosexual heredity&#x27; along.

In a debate in the Sociological Society, Ellis corresponded with the eugenicist Francis Galton, who was presenting a paper in support of marriage restrictions. While Galton analogized eugenics to breeding domesticated animals, Ellis felt that a greater sense of caution was needed before applying the eugenic regulations to populations, as &quot;we have scarcely yet realized how subtle and far-reaching hereditary influences are.&quot; Instead, because unlike domesticated animals, humans were in charge of who they mated with, Ellis argued that a greater emphasis was needed on public education about how vital this issue was. Ellis thus held much more moderate views than many contemporary eugenicists. In fact, Ellis also fundamentally disagreed with Galton&#x27;s leading ideas that procreation restrictions were the same as marriage restrictions. Ellis believed that those who should not procreate should still be able to gain all the other benefits of marriage, and to not allow that was an intolerable burden. This, in his mind, was what led to eugenics being &quot;misunderstood, ridiculed, and regarded as a fad&quot;.

Throughout his life, Ellis was both a member and later a council member of the Eugenics Society. Moreover, he played a role on the General Committee of the First International Eugenics Congress.

== Sexual impulse in youth ==
Ellis&#x27; 1933 book, &quot;Psychology of Sex&quot;, is one of the many manifestations of his interest in human sexuality. In this book, he goes into vivid detail of how children can experience sexuality differently in terms of time and intensity. He mentions that it was previously believed that, in childhood, humans had no sex impulse at all. &quot;If it is possible to maintain that the sex impulse has no normal existence in early life, then every manifestation of it at that period must be &#x27;perverse, he adds.

He continues by stating that, even in the early development and lower functional levels of the genitalia, there is a wide range of variation in terms of sexual stimulation. He claims that the ability of some infants producing genital reactions, seen as &quot;reflex signs of irritation&quot; are typically not vividly remembered. Since the details of these manifestations are not remembered, there is no possible way to determine them as pleasurable. However, Ellis claims that many people of both sexes can recall having agreeable sensations with the genitalia as a child. &quot;They are not (as is sometimes imagined) repressed.&quot; They are, however, not usually mentioned to adults. Ellis argues that they typically stand out and are remembered for the sole contrast of the intense encounter to any other ordinary experience.

Ellis claims that sexual self-excitement is known to happen at an early age. He references authors like Marc, Fonssagrives, and Perez in France, who published their findings in the nineteenth century. These &quot;early ages&quot; are not strictly limited to ages close to puberty, as can be seen in their findings. These authors provide cases for children of both sexes who have masturbated from the age of three or four. Ellis references Robie&#x27;s findings that boys&#x27; first sex feelings appear between the ages of five and fourteen. For girls, this age ranges from eight to nineteen.

For both sexes, these first sexual experiences arise more frequently during the later years as opposed to the earlier years. Ellis then references G.V. Hamilton&#x27;s studies that found twenty percent of males and fourteen percent of females have pleasurable experiences with their sex organs before the age of six. This is only supplemented by Ellis&#x27; reference to Katharine Davis&#x27; studies, which found that twenty to twenty-nine percent of boys and forty-nine to fifty-one percent of girls were masturbating by the age of eleven. However, in the next three years after, boys&#x27; percentages exceeded those of girls.

Ellis also contributed to the idea of varying levels of sexual excitation. He asserts it is a mistake to assume all children are able to experience genital arousal or pleasurable erotic sensations. He proposes cases where an innocent child is led to believe that stimulation of the genitalia will result in a pleasurable erection. Some of these children may fail and not be able to experience this, either pleasure or an erection, until puberty. Ellis concludes, then, that children are capable of a &quot;wide range of genital and sexual aptitude&quot;. Ellis even considers ancestry as a contribution to different sexual excitation levels, stating that children of &quot;more unsound heredity&quot; and/or hypersexual parents are &quot;more precociously excitable&quot;.

== Auto-eroticism ==
Ellis&#x27; views of auto-eroticism were very comprehensive, including much more than masturbation. Auto-eroticism, according to Ellis, includes a wide range of phenomena. Ellis states in his 1897 book &quot;Studies in the Psychology of Sex&quot;, that auto-eroticism ranges from erotic day-dreams, marked by a passivity shown by the subject, to &quot;unshamed efforts at sexual self-manipulation witnessed among the insane&quot;.

Ellis also argues that auto-erotic impulses can be heightened by bodily processes like menstrual flow. During this time, he says, women, who would otherwise not feel a strong propensity for auto-eroticism, increase their masturbation patterns. This trend is absent, however, in women without a conscious acceptance of their sexual feelings and in a small percentage of women suffering from a sexual or general ailment which result in a significant amount of &quot;sexual anesthesia&quot;.

Ellis also raises social concern over how auto-erotic tendencies affect marriages. He goes on to tying auto-eroticism to declining marriage rates. As these rates decline, he concludes that auto-eroticism will only increase in both amount and intensity for both men and women. Therefore, he states, this is an important issue to both the moralist and physician to investigate psychological underpinnings of these experiences and determine an attitude toward them.

== Smell ==
Ellis believed that the sense of smell, although ineffective at long ranges, still contributes to sexual attraction, and therefore, to mate selection. In his 1905 book, &quot;Sexual selection in man&quot;, Ellis makes a claim for the sense of smell in the role of sexual selection. He asserts that while we have evolved out of a great necessity for the sense of smell, we still rely on our sense of smell with sexual selection. The contributions that smell makes in sexual attraction can even be heightened with certain climates. Ellis states that with warmer climates come a heightened sensitivity to sexual and other positive feelings of smell among normal populations. Because of this, he believes people are often delighted by odors in the East, particularly in India, in &quot;Hebrew and Mohammedan lands&quot;. Ellis then continues by describing the distinct odours in various races, noting that the Japanese race has the least intense of bodily odours. Ellis concludes his argument by stating, &quot;On the whole, it may be said that in the usual life of man odours play a not inconsiderable part and raise problems which are not without interest, but that their demonstrable part in actual sexual selection is comparatively small.&quot;

==Views on women and birth control==
Ellis favoured feminism from a eugenic perspective, feeling that the enhanced social, economic, and sexual choices that feminism provided for women would result in women choosing partners who were more eugenically sound. In his view, intelligent women would not choose, nor be forced to marry and procreate with feeble-minded men.

Ellis viewed birth control as merely the continuation of an evolutionary progression, noting that natural progress has always consisted of increasing impediments to reproduction, which lead to a lower quantity of offspring, but a much higher quality of them. From a eugenic perspective, birth control was an invaluable instrument for the elevation of the race. However, Ellis noted that birth control could not be used randomly in a way that could have a detrimental impact by reducing conception, but rather needed to be used in a targeted manner to improve the qualities of certain &#x27;stocks&#x27;. He observed that it was the &#x27;superior stocks&#x27; who had knowledge of and used birth control while the &#x27;inferior stocks&#x27; propagated without checks. Ellis&#x27;s solution to this was a focus on contraceptives in education, as this would disseminate the knowledge in the populations that he felt needed them the most. Ellis argued that birth control was the only available way of making eugenic selection practicable, as the only other option was wide-scale abstention from intercourse for those who were &#x27;unfit&#x27;.

===Views on sterilization===
Ellis was strongly opposed to the idea of castration of either sex for eugenic purposes. In 1909, regulations were introduced at the Cantonal Asylum in Bern which allowed those deemed &#x27;unfit&#x27; or with strong sexual inclinations to be subject to mandatory sterilization. In a particular instance, two men and two women, including one person with epilepsy and one who had been arrested for &quot;offences against minors&quot;, were castrated. Both of the men had requested it. Ellis considered the behavioral outcomes favorable, but remained staunchly opposed to compulsory sterilization. His view on the origin of these inclinations was that sexual impulses do not reside in the sexual organs, but rather they persist in the brain. Moreover, he posited that the sexual glands provided an important source of internal secretions vital for the functioning of the organism, and thus the glands&#x27; removal could greatly injure the patient.

However, already in his time, Ellis was witness to the rise of vasectomies and ligatures of the fallopian tubes, which performed the same sterilization without removing the whole organ. In these cases, Ellis was much more favorable, yet still maintaining that &quot;sterilization of the unfit, if it is to be a practical and humane measure commanding general approval, must be voluntary on the part of the person undergoing it, and never compulsory.&quot; His opposition to such a system was not only rooted in morality. Rather, Ellis also considered the practicality of the situation, hypothesizing that if an already mentally unfit man is forced to undergo sterilization, he would only become more ill-balanced, and would end up committing more anti-social acts.

Though Ellis was never at ease with the idea of forced sterilizations, he was willing to find ways to circumvent that restriction. His focus was on the social ends of eugenics, and as a means to it, Ellis was in no way against &#x27;persuading&#x27; &#x27;volunteers&#x27; to undergo sterilization by withdrawing Poor Relief from them. While he preferred to convince those he deemed unfit using education, Ellis supported coercion as a tool. Furthermore, he supported adding ideas about eugenics and birth control to the education system in order to restructure society, and to promote social hygiene. For Ellis, sterilization seemed to be the only eugenic instrument that could be used on the mentally unfit. In fact, in his publication &quot;The Sterilization of the Unfit&quot;, Ellis argued that even institutionalization could not guarantee the complete prevention of procreation between the unfit, and thus, &quot;the burdens of society, to say nothing of the race, are being multiplied. It is not possible to view sterilization with enthusiasm when applied to any class of people…but what, I ask myself, is the practical alternative?&quot;

==Psychedelics==
Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. He consumed a brew made of three &quot;Lophophora williamsii&quot; buds in the afternoon of Good Friday alone in his set of rooms in Temple, London. During the experience, lasting for about 12 hours, he noted a plethora of extremely vivid, complex, colourful, pleasantly smelling hallucinations, consisting both of abstract geometrical patterns and objects such as butterflies and other insects. He published two accounts of the experience, one in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in June 1897 (&quot;A Note on the Phenomena of Mescal Intoxication&quot;), and a second in &quot;The Contemporary Review&quot; in 1898 (&quot;Mescal: A New Artificial Paradise&quot;). The title of the second article alludes to an earlier work on the effects of mind-altering substances, an 1860 book &quot;Les Paradis artificiels&quot; by French poet Charles Baudelaire (containing descriptions of experiments with opium and hashish).

Ellis was so impressed with the aesthetic quality of the experience that he gave some specimens of peyote to the Irish poet W. B. Yeats, a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, an organisation of which another mescaline researcher, Aleister Crowley, was also a member.

==Later life and death==
Ellis resigned from his position as a Fellow of the Eugenics Society over its stance on sterilization in January 1931.

Ellis spent the last year of his life at Hintlesham, Suffolk, where he died in July 1939. His ashes were scattered at Golders Green Crematorium, North London, following his cremation.

<text>Lucius Aelius Caesar (13 January 101 – 1 January 138) was the father of Emperor Lucius Verus. In 136, he was adopted by the reigning emperor Hadrian and named heir to the throne. He died before Hadrian and thus never became emperor. After Lucius&#x27; death, he was replaced by Antoninus Pius, who succeeded Hadrian the same year.

== Life and family ==

Aelius was born Lucius Ceionius Commodus, and became Lucius Aelius Caesar upon his adoption as Hadrian&#x27;s heir. He is sometimes referred to as Lucius Aelius Verus, though this name is not attested outside the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, where it probably was originally the result of a manuscript error. The young Lucius Ceionius Commodus was of the gens Ceionia. His father, also named Lucius Ceionius Commodus (the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; adds the cognomen Verus), was consul in 106 and his paternal grandfather, also of the same name, was consul in 78. His paternal ancestors were from Etruria, and were of consular rank. His mother is surmised to have been an undocumented Roman woman named Plautia. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; states that his maternal grandfather and his maternal ancestors were of consular rank.

Before 130, the younger Lucius Commodus married Avidia, a well-connected Roman noblewoman who was the daughter of the senator Gaius Avidius Nigrinus. Avidia bore Lucius at least one son and two daughters, who were: 
*Lucius Ceionius Commodus – The future Lucius Verus, co-emperor with Marcus Aurelius from 161 until his own death in 169. Verus would marry Lucilla, the second daughter of Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger.
* Ceionia Fabia – at the time of Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s adoption, she was betrothed, as part of the adoption conditions, to him. Shortly after Antoninus Pius&#x27; ascension, Pius came to Aurelius and asked him to end his engagement to Fabia, instead marrying Antoninus Pius’ daughter Faustina the Younger; Faustina had originally been planned by Hadrian to wed Lucius Verus.

==Heir to Hadrian==

For a long time, the emperor Hadrian had considered his brother-in-law Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus as his unofficial successor. As Hadrian&#x27;s reign drew to a close, however, he changed his mind. Although the emperor certainly thought Servianus capable of ruling as an emperor after Hadrian&#x27;s own death, Servianus, by now in his nineties, was clearly too old for the position. Hadrian&#x27;s attentions turned to Servianus&#x27; grandson, Lucius Pedanius Fuscus Salinator. Hadrian promoted the young Salinator, his great-nephew, gave him special status in his court, and groomed him as his heir.

However, in the summer of 136, Hadrian almost died from a haemorrhage. Convalescent in his villa at Tivoli, he decided to change his mind, and selected Lucius Ceionius Commodus as his new successor, adopting him as his son. The selection was done &quot;invitis omnibus&quot;, &quot;against the wishes of everyone&quot;; in particular, Servianus and the young Salinator became very angry at Hadrian and wished to challenge him over the adoption. Even today, the rationale for Hadrian&#x27;s sudden switch is still unclear. It is possible Salinator went so far as to attempt a coup against Hadrian in which Servianus was implicated. In order to avoid any potential conflict in the succession, Hadrian ordered the deaths of Salinator and Servianus.

==Death==
After a year&#x27;s stationing on the Danube frontier, Aelius returned to Rome to make an address to the senate on the first day of 138. The night before the speech, however, he grew ill, and died of a haemorrhage late the next day. On 24 January 138, Hadrian selected Titus Aurelius Antoninus as his new successor.

After a few days&#x27; consideration, Antoninus accepted. He was adopted on 25 February 138. As part of Hadrian&#x27;s terms, Antoninus adopted both Lucius Aelius&#x27;s son, Lucius Ceionius Commodus, and Hadrian&#x27;s great-nephew by marriage, Marcus Annius Verus. Marcus became &quot;Marcus Aelius Aurelius Verus&quot; (later Marcus Aurelius Antoninus); and Lucius became &quot;Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus&quot; (later Lucius Aurelius Verus). At Hadrian&#x27;s request, Antoninus&#x27; daughter Faustina was betrothed to Lucius.

Marcus Aurelius later co-ruled with Lucius Verus as joint Roman Emperors, until Lucius Verus died in 169, after which Aurelius was sole ruler until his own death in 180.

In his &quot;History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, Edward Gibbon tells of Aelius&#x27;s brief time as Hadrian&#x27;s successor-designate in these terms:

After revolving in his mind several men of distinguished merit, whom he esteemed and hated, [Hadrian] adopted Ælius Verus a gay and voluptuous nobleman, recommended by uncommon beauty to the lover of Antinous. But whilst Hadrian was delighting himself with his own applause, and the acclamations of the soldiers, whose consent had been secured by an immense donative, the new Cæsar was ravished from his embraces by an untimely death.

== Sources ==
The major sources for the life of Aelius are patchy and frequently unreliable. The most important group of sources, the biographies contained in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, claim to be written by a group of authors at the turn of the 4th century, but are in fact written by a single author (referred to here as &quot;the biographer&quot;) from the later 4th century (c. 395).

The later biographies and the biographies of subordinate emperors and usurpers are a tissue of lies and fiction, but the earlier biographies, derived primarily from now-lost earlier sources (Marius Maximus or Ignotus), are much more accurate. For Aelius, the biographies of Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus and Lucius Verus are largely reliable, but that of Avidius Cassius, and even Lucius Aelius&#x27; own, is full of fiction.

Some other literary sources provide specific detail: the writings of the physician Galen on the habits of the Antonine elite, the orations of Aelius Aristides on the temper of the times, and the constitutions preserved in the &quot;Digest&quot; and &quot;Codex Justinianus&quot; on Marcus&#x27; legal work. Inscriptions and coin finds supplement the literary sources.

All citations to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; are to individual biographies, and are marked with a &quot;HA&quot;. Citations to the works of Fronto are cross-referenced to C.R. Haines&#x27; Loeb edition.

<text>This is a list of the heads of state of Ghana, from the independence of Ghana in 1957 to the present day.

From 1957 to 1960 the head of state under the Constitution of 1957 was the queen of Ghana, Elizabeth II, who was also the monarch of other Commonwealth realms. The monarch was represented in Ghana by a governor-general. Ghana became a republic within the Commonwealth under the Constitution of 1960 and the monarch and governor-general were replaced by an executive president.

==Monarch (1957–1960)==
The succession to the throne was the same as the succession to the British throne.

===Governor-general===
The governor-general was the representative of the monarch in Ghana and exercised most of the powers of the monarch. The governor-general was appointed for an indefinite term, serving at the pleasure of the monarch. Since Ghana was granted independence by the Ghana Independence Act 1957, rather than being first established as a semi-autonomous Dominion and later promoted to independence by the Statute of Westminster 1931, the governor-general was to be always appointed solely on the advice of the Cabinet of Ghana without the involvement of the British government, with the sole exception of Charles Arden-Clarke, the former colonial governor, who served as governor-general temporarily until he was replaced by William Hare. In the event of a vacancy the chief justice served as officer administering the government.

<doc id="392250" wikidata="Q473214" url="?curid=392250" title="Laisenia Qarase">
<text>Laisenia Qarase (pronounced ; 4 February 1941 – 21 April 2020) was a Fijian politician. He served as the sixth Prime Minister of Fiji from 2000 to 2006. After the military quashed the coup that led to the removal of Mahendra Chaudhry, Qarase joined the Interim Military Government as a financial adviser on 9 June 2000, until his appointment as Prime Minister on 4 July. He won two parliamentary elections, but a military coup removed him from power on 5 December 2006. He was later imprisoned on corruption charges brought by the military-backed regime.

A native of Vanua Balavu Island in the Lau archipelago, he was one of many Lauans to have held top leadership positions in Fiji.

==Early and personal life==

Qarase was born in 1941 into the Tota clan in Mavana on Vanua Balavu, the son of Josateki Mate of Mavana village. After attending local schools, he enrolled at Suva Boys Grammar School. Following his education at Suva Boys Grammar School, Qarase left Fiji in 1959 and went on to graduate from New Zealand&#x27;s University of Auckland with a degree in Commerce. He got his first job at the Fijian Affairs Board and served as a career civil servant at the ministries of Finance, Commerce and Industry and Public Service. He entered the banking profession and became the first ethnic Fijian managing director of the publicly owned Fiji Development Bank (FDB) in 1983, a position he held for fifteen years. After the 1987 coup, he was called in by the new government to help to rebuild the damaged economy. He introduced the nine-point plan which oversaw extended government assistance to Fijians and the creation of Fijian Holdings. However, the plan mostly resulted in bankruptcies and he was embroiled in a scandal in Fijian Holdings over the acquisition of shares by his family. In 1994, he became the chairman of Fiji Television and clashed with the government for not consulting him over its plans to introduce US investment into the company.

Qarase had Indigenous Fijian, Tongan, and Jewish ancestry. Qarase&#x27;s mother is the daughter of John Herman Ma’afu Bowman, who had Jewish parents, Alexander Bowman and Sara Annette. He was married to Leba Qarase, with whom he had five children. Qarase was a chief in his native village of Mavana, on the island of Vanua Balavu, where he held the traditional chiefly title of Tui Kobuco.

== 2006 coup and aftermath ==

On the occasion of his 65th birthday on 4 February 2006, Qarase stated that if re-elected in the election that was duly held on 6–13 May, it would very likely be his last term in office. He won re-election, but continuing disagreements between his government and the powerful Republic of Fiji Military Forces culminated in a military coup on 5 December. Fiji Village reported the next day that he had been flown to his home island of Vanuabalavu by the military, while Radio New Zealand claimed that he had fled there. He told Radio New Zealand that he was &quot;down but not out&quot;; he intended to fight on, and called for a peaceful popular uprising. On the same day it was reported that he had asked for military assistance from Australia. The BBC reported that after being warned by Commodore Bainimarama not to &quot;incite violence&quot;, Prime Minister Qarase planned to return to Suva, from which he was banished, but was warned that he faced arrest if he returned.

From Vanuabalavu, he remained outspoken in condemning the military takeover, comparing the new regime to those of Saddam Hussein, Adolf Hitler, and Idi Amin, in an interview quoted in the Fiji Times and Fiji Village on 13 and 14 December 2006.

On 2 February, Fiji Village quoted Qarase as having told Radio Australia that he was considering contesting the election to restore democracy, expected to be held within the next five years. Qarase called for the date to be brought forward.

On 6 September 2007, Bainimarama imposed a renewed state of emergency for one month, alleging that Qarase and his spokesman, Peceli Kinivuwai, were spreading lies and attempting to cause destabilization, following Qarase&#x27;s return to Suva after having been confined to Vanuabalavu since his ousting. Bainimarama said that Qarase and his spokesman should return to Vanuabalavu and that they could &quot;talk from there.&quot;

Qarase initiated a court challenge to the coup on 4 October 2007. Martial law was lifted on 6 October on the grounds that there was no threat.

Elections were tentatively set in February 2009 but did not occur until September 2014. Qarase was one of several politicians banned from running for office and his political party was forced to disband. It reorganised, but was forced to take a name in English, not Fijian (Social Democratic Liberal Party). It was later forced to change its initials to not match Qarase&#x27;s former party, although its policy positions remained similar.

=== Financing allegations ===

In January 2010, it was reported that Qarase would stand trial on charges, brought by the Military-backed interim government, of abusing his office. Qarase was found guilty of abusing his office and failing to perform his duty, and sentenced on 3 August 2012 to one year in prison. His supporters say the charges were politically motivated.

<text>Tynwald Day () is the National Day of the Isle of Man, usually observed on 5 July (if this is a Saturday or Sunday, then on the following Monday).

On this day, the Island&#x27;s legislature, Tynwald, meets at St John&#x27;s, instead of its usual meeting place in Douglas. The session is held partly in the Royal Chapel of St John the Baptist and partly in the open air on the adjacent Tynwald Hill (a small artificial mound). The meeting, which dates back to the 10th century, is known as &quot;Midsummer Court&quot;. It is attended by members of the two branches of Tynwald: the House of Keys and the Legislative Council. The Lieutenant Governor, the representative of the Lord of Mann, presides except on the occasions when the Lord of Mann or another member of the British Royal Family is present.

All bills that have received Royal Assent are promulgated on Tynwald Day; any Act of Tynwald which is not so promulgated within 18 months of passage ceases to have effect. Other proceedings include the presentation of petitions and the swearing in of certain public officials.

==Date==
Tynwald Day had traditionally been held on 24 June, which is the feast day of St John the Baptist and also Midsummer&#x27;s Day. In 1753, the Isle of Man legislated to replace the Julian Calendar with the Gregorian Calendar after Great Britain had done so in the previous year; making a difference of 11 days. But the legislation retained the Julian Calendar for the purpose of determining Tynwald Day: it provided that &quot;Midsummer Tynwald Court shall be holden and kept ... upon or according to the same natural Days upon or according to which the same should have been so kept or holden ... in case this Act had never been made.&quot; Hence Tynwald Day occurred on 24 June in the Julian Calendar, but on 5 July according to the Gregorian Calendar. It was not subsequently moved back to 7 July, even though the Gregorian Calendar is now 13 days ahead of the Julian Calendar as the Gregorian Calendar had no leap day in 1800 or 1900. If 5 July falls on a Saturday or Sunday, Tynwald Day is normally celebrated on the next Monday, as happened in 2008, 2009 and 2020.

In 1979, Tynwald celebrated its millennium with a year-long festival of events showcasing Tynwald as the world&#x27;s &quot;oldest continuous parliament&quot;. This included building a replica Viking longship called Odin&#x27;s Raven which recreated the early Norse voyages from Norway to the Isle of Man; the ship landed at Peel Beach on Tynwald Day 1979. 

In 2020, due to Covid-19, the fair and market were cancelled, and only the legal proceedings took place.

==Participants==
Midsummer Courts were sometimes presided over personally by the Lords of Mann, but more often by his representatives, as the Lords of Mann were often British aristocrats or monarchs who were not resident in the island. After the Duke of Atholl presided in 1736, over two centuries passed before a Lord of Mann participated in Tynwald Day ceremonies. George VI presided in 1946; his successor Elizabeth II presided in 1979 (the millennial anniversary of Tynwald&#x27;s establishment) and again in 2003. Occasionally another member of the Royal Family may preside, as the Prince Edward did in 1986, and the Prince of Wales did in 2000. 
The Lieutenant Governor is preceded by the Sword-Bearer, who wears a scarlet uniform and bears the Sword of State. The Sword of State probably dates from the 15th century, and may have been made for Sir John Stanley. The Sword, which is blunt for the sake of safety, displays the Manx triskelion (the traditional &quot;three legs&quot; symbol which also appears on the Manx flag).

Members of the House of Keys and of the Legislative Council are also in attendance. The Speaker of the House of Keys wears a wig and black robes with gold decorations. The President of Tynwald wears a wig and blue robes with silver decorations. The President&#x27;s robes also display the triskelion.

The Isle of Man&#x27;s highest judicial officers, the Deemsters, participate in the ceremony, wearing scarlet robes and long wigs. There are currently three Deemsters, including the First and Second Deemster. Their office is of great antiquity, as is reflected by the curious phraseology of their ancient oath, during which they promise to &quot;execute the laws of this isle justly … betwixt party and party, as indifferently as the herring&#x27;s backbone doth lie in the midst of the fish.&quot;

Some individuals are invited to attend as &quot;Guests of Honour&quot;. Guests of Honour include representatives of the United Kingdom and of other nations, usually including the Republic of Ireland and some Scandinavian countries. In recent years, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have sent separate representatives, in addition to those for the United Kingdom. Notable guests in recent years have included: David Waddington, Baron Waddington (1998), Gareth Wyn Williams (1999), Rory O&#x27;Hanlon (1999/2005), Liam T. Cosgrave (2002), Harald V of Norway (2002), David Steel (2002), Jack McConnell and the British Lord Chancellor Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton (2003).

Other participants include clergymen, leaders of local governments and several other officials, including all the State Officials of the Isle of Man. All participants wear , otherwise known as mugwort. Detachments and bands from the Constabulary and the military also take part in the ceremony, which is also attended by members of the general public.

The ceremony is coordinated by the Tynwald Ceremony Arrangements Committee. The President of Tynwald is the &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman; the Committee&#x27;s other members include the Speaker of the House of Keys and the Chief Minister. Recently, a Tynwald Settings Enhancements Sub-Committee was constituted to improve Tynwald Day celebrations; the President and Speaker both serve on it, with the former serving as chairman.

==Procession==
Before Tynwald sits, the individual presiding inspects the Guard of honour and lays a wreath at the National War Memorial, which was inaugurated in 1923. A foreign head of state attending the ceremony may accompany the Lieutenant Governor, as the King of Norway did in 2002.

At eleven o&#x27;clock, Tynwald convenes in the Chapel of St John the Baptist for a religious service. Thereafter, they proceed to the adjacent Tynwald Hill. The path is strewn with rushes; the tradition is traceable to the Celtic custom of propitiating the sea god Manannan by offering bundles of rushes on Midsummer&#x27;s Eve. The path is lined with numerous flagpoles, which fly both the red national flag and the blue parliamentary flag.

The first procession includes clergymen and certain government officials. The second procession, known as the Tynwald Court Procession, follows; in order, it comprises the officers of the House of Keys, the members of the House of Keys, the Chief Minister of the Isle of Man, the Speaker of the House of Keys, a messenger of the House of Keys, officers of the Legislative Council, members of the Legislative Council, the Attorney General, the Deemsters, the Bishop of Sodor and Man, the President of Tynwald and a messenger of the Legislative Council. Thereafter, two guards, the Sword-bearer, the Presiding Officer and the Lieutenant Governor (if not presiding).

Dr John Clague described the procession as such in his 1911 book (Manx Reminiscences)
Glenfaba is the sheading in which St John&#x27;s is situated.

==Tynwald Hill==
The main ceremonies of the day take place on Tynwald Hill, known in the Manx language as &quot;Cronk-y-Keeillown&quot;, or the Hill of the Church of John, in the village of St John&#x27;s. This mound is said to include soil from all 17 of the Island&#x27;s parishes. The mound, approximately 12 feet (3.7 metres) in height, includes four circular platforms, which are of successively decreasing size, thereby giving Tynwald Hill a somewhat conical shape.

The ceremony of proclaiming laws on Tynwald Hill is traceable to the Norse practice of making public proclamations from mounds: Iceland, for example, once used the Lögberg (Law-Rock or Law-Hill) for the same purpose. The origins of the man-made Tynwald Hill are unclear, but it existed by the end of the 14th century. It was used in 1393 for the inauguration of Sir William le Scrope, and again in 1408 for the inauguration of Sir John Stanley, as Lords of Mann. Its first recorded use for the promulgation of laws dates to 24 June 1417, when Sir John Stanley presided.

The Lieutenant Governor, together with the Sword-Bearer and the officers and members of the Legislative Council, occupy the highest level of the Hill; officers and members of the House of Keys occupy the next level. Other officials are accommodated on the lower levels and at the foot of the mound. A tent covers the top platform. The flag of the Isle of Man flies from the flagpole except when the British Sovereign presides, when the Royal Standard flies.

After the royal anthem is sung, the First Deemster and Clerk of the Rolls, upon the instruction of the Lieutenant Governor, directs the Coroner of Glenfaba to &quot;fence the Court&quot;. The coroner accomplishes the task by declaring, &quot;I fence this Court of Tynwald in the name of our most gracious Sovereign Lord The King. I charge that no person do quarrel, brawl or make any disturbance and that all persons do answer to their names when called. I charge this audience to witness this Court is fenced. I charge this audience to witness this Court is fenced. I charge this whole audience to bear witness this Court is now fenced.&quot; (the Reader) then repeats the same words in Manx.

After the Court is fenced, the coroners appointed for the coming year take the oath. The Coroners of the six sheadings ascend the Hill in order of precedence (there are now four such Coroners) commencing with the Coroner of Glenfaba and Michael, followed (in a clockwise direction around the Island) by the Coroner of Ayre and Garff, the Coroner of Middle and the Coroner of Rushen. The First Deemster administers the oath to the kneeling coroners: &quot;By that book and by the holy contents thereof and by the wonderful works that God hath miraculously wrought in heaven above and in the earth beneath in six days and seven nights, you shall, without respect of favour or friendship, love or gain, consanguinity or affinity, envy or malice, well and truly execute the office of coroner for each sheading to which you have been appointed for the ensuing year. So help you God.&quot; The phrase &quot;wonderful works that God hath miraculously wrought ... in six days and seven nights&quot; alludes to the Book of Genesis. The Coroners then receive ceremonial staves from the Lieutenant Governor.

After the Coroners take the oath, the Lieutenant Governor states, &quot;Learned deemsters, I exhort you to proclaim to the people in ancient form such laws as have been enacted during the past year and which have received the Royal Assent.&quot; Each law is promulgated by the First Deemster in English and by the Second Deemster in Manx. The deemsters state the title, and a brief description of the effects, of each act. For example, on Tynwald Day in 2003, one Act was promulgated with the words &quot;Transfer of Deemsters&#x27; Functions Act 2003, which transfers certain functions of the deemsters to the Treasury.&quot; If an Act of Tynwald is not promulgated within 18 months of receiving the Royal Assent, it ceases to remain valid.

Once the deemsters have promulgated the laws, individuals may present petitions for the redress of grievances. Petitions are presented at the foot of Tynwald Hill to the Clerk of Tynwald, who conveys them to the Lieutenant Governor. The petitions are then referred to a committee of Tynwald. Thereafter, after the singing of the first verse of the National Anthem, the Deputy Chief Constable of the Isle of Man Constabulary calls the participants individually off the Hill and they proceed to the Chapel.

==Captioning ceremony==
Tynwald then reconvenes in the Chapel. While Tynwald conducts substantive business in Douglas, it only participates in the &quot;captioning ceremony&quot; at St John&#x27;s. During the ceremony, the Lieutenant Governor, the President of Tynwald and the Speaker of the House of Keys use quills1 to sign certificates documenting the promulgation of the laws.

Once the captioning of the acts has concluded, the Lieutenant Governor and the Legislative Council withdraw, leaving members of the House of Keys for a session of their house. If there are any bills that have not completed all of their stages in the House of Keys, a member moves &quot;That all Bills and other business before the House remaining unfinished at this date be suspended and continued at the same stage at the first sitting of the House in the next legislative year.&quot; This &quot;pro forma&quot; motion is approved by a voice vote; the House of Keys then adjourns. Even if there remains no unfinished business before it, the House of Keys still meets, but no motion is made, and adjournment is immediate.

After Tynwald Day, Tynwald Court returns to Douglas for three further sittings, normally held on the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday following Tynwald Day. If, however, Tynwald Day falls on a Monday, the sittings are not held until the following week. Following these sittings, Tynwald adjourns for the summer, not reconvening until October.

1 The use of quills appears now to have ceased.

==Other celebrations==
Traditionally, Tynwald Day was also marked by a fair and market; these customs still continue. In recent years, the Tynwald Settings Enhancements Sub-Committee has introduced several other forms of celebration. Since 2000, the week of Tynwald Day has been commemorated as &quot;Manx National Week&quot;. Concerts are held in the evening; at the conclusion, the Manx national anthem is played, and a fireworks display is staged.

<text>Sir Howard Felix Hanlan Cooke (13 November 1915 – 11 July 2014) served as the fourth Governor-General of Jamaica from 1 August 1991 to 15 February 2006.

==Early life==
Cooke was born on 13 November 1915, in Goodwill, St. James, Jamaica, the son of David Brown Cooke and Mary Jane Minto. In his youth, Cooke was the group scoutmaster and secretary of the St. Andrew Boys&#x27; Scout Association and captain of the County of Cornwall cricket team. He attended Mico University College in Kingston and London University in London. Cooke was a teacher for 23 years, serving as President of the Jamaica Union of Teachers and Headmaster of Belle Castle All-Age School, Port Antonio Upper School, and Montego Bay Boys&#x27; School. He was also active in the insurance industry for some three decades, working at Standard Life Insurance Company, Jamaica Mutual Life Insurance Company, and ALICO.

==Career==
One of the founding members of the People&#x27;s National Party (PNP), Cooke joined politics in 1938. He became a member of the Parliament of the West Indies Federation in 1958, and then the independent Jamaican Parliament as a Senator and a Member of the House of Representatives after 1962. He was a minister in the government of Michael Manley during the 1970s and President of the Senate of Jamaica from 1989 to 1991. On 1 August 1991, he became the fourth Governor-General of Jamaica, succeeding Florizel Glasspole. Queen Elizabeth visited Jamaica in 1994 and 2002 while Cooke was Governor-General. He retired on 15 February 2006, and became the first Governor-General to invest his successor, Kenneth Octavius Hall. Afterwards, Cooke was appointed Chancellor of the International University of the Caribbean in Kingston.

==Personal life and death==
Cooke had several views of British colonialism and slavery. 
In 2006, he remarked, &quot;Even during slavery the British were sending some very good people out to Jamaica...Missionaries, Reformers...Jamaica&#x27;s greatness was not entirely due to slavery.&quot;
He was critical of Margaret Thatcher, her views stating that &quot;after Thatcher we became more and more materialist... But there&#x27;s more to life than cars and dollars.&quot;

On 22 July 1939, Cooke married schoolteacher Ivy Sylvia Lucille (née Tai). The couple had two sons, retired Court of Appeal Justice Howard Fitz-Arthur Cooke and hotelier Richard Washington McDermott Cooke, and one daughter, counsellor Audrey Faith.

Howard Cooke died at the age of 98 on 11 July 2014 in Kingston, Jamaica, only 11 days before he and Lady Cooke&#x27;s 75th wedding anniversary. Lady Cooke died on 4 June 2017 aged 100.

==Awards and honours==
In 1980, Cooke received the Special Plaque for Distinguished Service from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. In 1991, Cooke was awarded both the Order of the Nation and the Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). In 1994, he was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO). Several places in Jamaica are named after Howard Cooke, including the Howard Cooke Boulevard, Howard Cooke Primary School, and the Howard Cooke Campus at the International University of the Caribbean.

<doc id="392258" wikidata="Q2672728" url="?curid=392258" title="President of Ghana">
<text>The president of the Republic of Ghana is the elected head of state and head of government of Ghana, as well as commander-in-chief of the Ghana Armed Forces. The current president of Ghana is John Mahama, who won the 2024 presidential election against then vice president, Mahamudu Bawumia, by a margin of 14.94%. He was sworn into office on 7 January 2025. From 1957 to 1960 the head of state under the Constitution of 1957 was the queen of Ghana, Elizabeth II, who was also the monarch of other Commonwealth realms. The monarch was represented in Ghana by a governor-general. Ghana became a republic within the Commonwealth under the Constitution of 1960 and the monarch and governor-general were replaced by an executive president.

==Eligibility==
According to Chapter 8, Article 62 of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana, a person shall not be qualified for election as the president of Ghana unless: 

*(a) is a citizen of Ghana by birth
*(b) has attained the age of forty years; and
*(c) is a person who is otherwise qualified to be elected a Member of Parliament, except that the disqualifications set out in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of clause (2) of article 94 of this Constitution shall not be removed, in respect of any such person, by a presidential pardon or by the lapse of time as provided for in clause (5) of that article.

Presidential candidates must lodge a nomination document signed by at least two registered voters in each district, and includes the name of a vice presidential running mate.

The president serves a four-year term. The president is limited to two terms, whether successive or separated. The first president for whom the term limits applied was Jerry Rawlings in 2001.

If the president dies, resigns, is permanently incapacitated, or is removed from office, the vice president automatically ascends as president for the balance of the term. If the vice president ascends to the presidency before more than half of the presidential term expires, the vice president is only allowed to run for a single full term as president. If both the president and vice president are unable to perform the duties of president, the Speaker of Parliament becomes acting president, and new elections must be held within three months.

== Oath of office ==
The president of Ghana must be sworn in by the chief justice before Parliament and the citizens of Ghana. The president-elect must repeat the following:

&quot;I, _______________ having been elected to the high office of President of the Republic of Ghana do (in the name of the Almighty God swear) (solemnly affirm) that I will be faithful and true to the Republic of Ghana; that I will at all times preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Republic of Ghana; and that I dedicate myself to the service and well-being of the people of the Republic of Ghana and to do right to all manner of persons.

I further (solemnly swear) (solemnly affirm) that should I at any time break this oath of office; I shall submit myself to the laws of the Republic of Ghana and suffer the penalty for it. (So help me God)&quot;.

==Insignia==
After the oath of office has been taken by the elected president, these following insignia are handed over to the president. These devices are used to display the rank of his/her office and are used on special occasions.

*President&#x27;s Sword (image) and the Presidential Seat, Presidential standard pole and state sword. A carved wooden seat overlaid with gold.

==Powers and duties of the president==
Chapter 8 of the Constitution of Ghana states the duties and the powers of the president.
The president is required to:
* uphold the Constitution
* exercise executive authority
* preserve the safety and homeland of Ghana.

Also, the president is given the powers:

* to hold referendums regarding issues of national importance
* to issue executive orders
* to issue medals in honor of service for the nation
* to issue pardons
* to declare a state of emergency suspending all laws or enacting a state of martial law.

The president may execute or cause to be executed treaties, agreements or conventions in the name of the Republic of Ghana. The president shall take precedence over the populace of the Republic of Ghana and may refer important policy matters to a national referendum, declare war, conclude peace and other treaties, appoint senior public officials, and grant amnesty (with the concurrence of the Parliament of Ghana). In times of serious internal or external turmoil or threat, or economic or financial crises, the president may assume emergency powers &quot;for the maintenance of national security or public peace and order&quot;.

The president shall be removed from office if found, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, Chapter 8 section 69 (ii) – prejudicial or inimical to the economy or the security of the Republic of Ghana. The president shall cease to hold office on the date the Parliament of Ghana votes to remove the president from office.

== Presidential Aircraft ==

The official presidential aircraft is a Dassault Falcon 900, registration 9G-EXE, which was acquired in 2010. The aircraft was overhauled for six months in 2022, and returned to service in February 2023.

The presidential aircraft uses the colour scheme of the flag of Ghana in stripes, with the Ghanaian coat of arms on the tail.

In 2011, the government purchased an Embraer 190 making a part payment of $55m however it was revealed in 2020 that the jet was not delivered. There has been some speculation to whether or not the delivery was cancelled due to the government defaulting on its payment.

<doc id="392260" wikidata="Q372668" url="?curid=392260" title="John the Merciful">
<text>John V Eleemon (), also known as John the Almsgiver, John the Almoner, John the Compassionate, or John the Merciful, was the Chalcedonian/Melkite Patriarch of Alexandria in the early 7th century (from 606 to 616). He was born in Amathus around 560. Originally appointed by the emperor Heraclius, he later resisted attempts by the emperor to persecute the monophysites. At the end of his life he was obliged to flee back to Cyprus, where he died around 620.

He was unusual for his time in a number of ways. He was a married man with children, was elected bishop as a layman, and became a saint without being a martyr. He is one of the very few Byzantine era saints to gain a following in the West. He was one of the saints in the Golden Legend. He became famous as the original patron of the order of St. John of the Hospital, the Hospitallers, one of the great Western crusading military orders. This order still survives as the Knights of Malta. In the British Commonwealth, the &quot;St. John&#x27;s Ambulance Corps&quot; is named after him.

He is considered a saint in both the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. He is also the patron saint of Casarano, Italy and of Limassol, Cyprus.

His &quot;life&quot; was written by his contemporary Leontius bishop of Neapolis in Cyprus, who seems to have known him personally.

== Early life ==
He was born at Amathus as the son of Epiphanius, governor of Cyprus, and was of noble descent. In early life he was married and had children, but his wife and children soon died, after which he entered religious life.

== Patriarch of Alexandria ==
On the death of the Patriarch Theodore, the Alexandrians besought Emperor Phocas to appoint John his successor, which was accordingly done. One of the first steps he took was to make a list of several thousand needy persons, whom he took under his especial care. He always referred to the poor as his &quot;lords and masters&quot;, because of their mighty influence at the Court of the Most High. He assisted people of every class who were in need. 

He was a reformer who attacked simony, and fought heresy by means of improvements in religious education. He also reorganized the system of weights and measures for the sake of the poor, and put a stop to corruption among the officials. He increased the number of churches in Alexandria from seven to seventy.

The ministry of Vitalis of Gaza, a monk who worked among the prostitutes of the city, was a noteworthy episode of John&#x27;s reign. The patriarch was considered to have behaved with wisdom for not punishing this monk who was notorious for visiting the seedy part of town, and his judgment was vindicated only after the death of Vitalis when the story of the monk&#x27;s mission of mercy became known.

== Anecdotes from the Life by Leontius ==
In his youth John had had a vision of a beautiful maiden with a garland of olives on her head, who said that she was Compassion, the eldest daughter of the Great King. This had evidently made a deep impression on John&#x27;s mind, and, now that he had the opportunity of exercising benevolence on a large scale, he soon became widely known all over the East for his liberality towards the poor.

A shipwrecked merchant was thus helped three times, on the first two occasions apparently without doing him much good; the third time however, John fitted him out with a ship and a cargo of wheat, and by favourable winds he was taken as far as Britain, where, as there was a shortage of wheat, he obtained his own price. 

Another person, who was not really in need, applied for alms and was detected by the officers of the palace; but John merely said &quot;Give unto him; he may be Our Lord in disguise.&quot; He visited the hospitals three times every week, and he freed a great many slaves. John is said to have devoted the entire revenues of his see to the alleviation of those in need. A rich man presented him with a magnificent bed covering; he accepted it for one night, but then sold it, and disposed of the money in alms. The rich man &quot;bought in&quot; the article, and again presented it to John, with the same result. This was repeated several times; but John drily remarked: &quot;We will see who tires first.&quot; 

Another instance of his piety was that he caused his own grave to be dug, but only partly so, and appointed a servant to come before him on all state occasions and say &quot;My Lord, your tomb is unfinished; pray give orders for its completion, for you know not the hour when death may seize you.&quot; When the Sassanids sacked Jerusalem in 614, John sent large supplies of food, wine, and money to the fleeing Christians. But eventually the Persians occupied Alexandria, and John himself in his old age was forced to flee to his native country, where he died.

==Death and veneration==
John died in Cyprus somewhere between 616 and 620.

From Cyprus his body was moved to Constantinople, then in 1249 to Venice, where there is a church dedicated to him, the Chiesa di San Giovanni Elemosinario, although his relics are preserved in another church, San Giovanni in Bragora, in a separate chapel.

Another relic of him was sent by Sultan Bayezid II in 1489 to King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. It was placed in the private Royal Chapel in Buda Castle, which was dedicated to him. Now his body lies in the &quot;St. John the Merciful Chapel&quot; in St. Martin&#x27;s Cathedral in Bratislava, Slovakia. 

A church in Cospicua, Malta, is dedicated to him, and one of the bastions of the Santa Margherita Lines in the same city is also named after him.

<text>The president of the Republic of Kenya () is the head of state and head of government of the Republic of Kenya. The president is also the head of the executive branch of the Government of Kenya and is the commander-in-chief of the Kenya Defence Forces. The country&#x27;s current president is William Ruto since 13 September 2022.

On 12 December 1964, the Republic of Kenya was proclaimed, and Jomo Kenyatta became Kenya&#x27;s first president.

Kenya has had a total of five presidents since establishment, in successive order: Jomo Kenyatta, Daniel arap Moi, Mwai Kibaki, Uhuru Kenyatta, and the incumbent, William Ruto, who was inaugurated on 13 September 2022. Moi remains the country&#x27;s longest serving president, having served for a total of 24 years.

== Qualifications and election to office ==
According to the current Constitution, if a person wishes to be elected as president, the following qualifications must be met:

A candidate will be disqualified to run for presidency if they have allegiance to a foreign state or is working for the government in any capacity as a public officer. Being a public officer is not applicable to the incumbent president if running for a second term.

The president is elected by popular vote in the general election held in the month of August every five years. For a presidential candidate to be declared the winner, they must have:

# More than half of the total votes cast in the election; and
# At least 25% of the votes cast in each of more than half of the 47 counties in the country.

The official residence of the president of Kenya is State House, Nairobi.

The wife of the president is referred to as the first lady of Kenya.

== Term of office ==
A president is eligible for two consecutive terms of five years each, starting from the date the president is sworn in.

== List of presidents ==
==Presidential standards==
As with most other countries, the president of Kenya has a presidential standard to signify their status as the country&#x27;s head of state and government. Its design is generally based on the country&#x27;s national flag, although the president has some leeway to customise its appearance. The flag is generally displayed in notable locations associated with the president, usually alongside the national flag, such as the president&#x27;s offices and the president&#x27;s official state car, and during notable state occasions.

The presidential standards of Kenya&#x27;s presidents since the country&#x27;s independence have been as follows:

<doc id="392267" wikidata="Q13496" url="?curid=392267" title="Brindisi">
<text>Brindisi ( ; ) is a city in the region of Apulia in southern Italy, the capital of the province of Brindisi, on the coast of the Adriatic Sea.
Historically, the city has played an essential role in trade and culture due to its strategic position on the Italian Peninsula and its natural port on the Adriatic Sea. The city remains a major port for trade with the Balkan Peninsula, Greece and the Middle East. Its industries include agriculture, chemical works, and the generation of electricity.

From September 1943 to February 1944, Brindisi was the provisional government seat of the Kingdom of Italy, meaning that the city has been one of the 5 capitals in the history of Italy.

==Etymology==
The name comes from the Latin Brundisium through the Greek Brentesion and Messapi Brention, meaning &quot;head of the deer&quot; related to Albanian bri, brî - pl. Brini zi (black horn) brirë, brinë (&quot;horn&quot;; &quot;antler&quot;) [&lt; late Proto-Albanian *brina &lt; earlier *brena ]. The city&#x27;s name appears, therefore, to refer to the shape of the port which recalls the shape of the head of the animal.

===Heraldry===

The emblem of the city of Brindisi relates to certain unique characteristics of the ancient city of Brindisi, some of which are still visible today. The head of the deer derives from the Messapic name of the city &quot;Brention&quot;, a name inspired by the shape of the port city, which is reminiscent of the stag antlers. The emblem also contains the so-called &quot;terminal pillar&quot; of the Appian Way.

==History==
===Ancient times===

Several traditions concern its founders; one claims it was founded by the legendary hero Diomedes. The geographer Strabo says that it was colonized from Knossos in Crete.

Brindisi was originally a Messapian settlement predating the Roman expansion. The Latin name &quot;Brundisium&quot;, through the Greek &quot;Brentesion&quot;, is a corruption of the Messapian &quot;Brention&quot; meaning &quot;deer&#x27;s head&quot; and probably referring to the shape of the natural harbour. According to other sources, in 267 BC (245 BC), it was conquered by the Romans and became a Latin colony.
The peninsula of the Punta lands, which is located in the outer harbor, has been identified as a Bronze Age village (16th century BC) where a group of huts, protected by a barrier of stones, yielded fragments of Mycenaean pottery. Herodotus spoke of the Mycenaean origin of these populations. The necropolis of Tor Pisana (south of the old town of Brindisi) returned Corinthian jars in the first half of the 7th century BC. The Brindisi Messapia certainly entertained strong business relationships with the opposite side of the Adriatic and the Greek populations of the Aegean Sea.

After the Punic Wars, it became a major center of Roman naval power and maritime trade. In the Social War, it received Roman citizenship and was made a free port by Sulla. It suffered, however, from a siege conducted by Caesar in 49 BC, part of Caesar&#x27;s Civil War (&quot;Bell. Civ. i.&quot;) and was again attacked in 42 and 40 BC, with the latter giving rise to the Treaty of Brundisium between Octavian, Mark Antony and Lepidus in the autumn of the same year.

The poet Pacuvius was born here about 220 BC, and here the famous poet Virgil died in 19 BC. Under the Romans, Brundisium – a large city in its day with some 100,000 inhabitants – was an active port, the chief point of embarkation for Greece and the East, via Dyrrachium or Corcyra. It was connected with Rome by the Via Appia and the Via Traiana. The termination of the Via Appia, at the water&#x27;s edge, was formerly flanked by two fine pillars. Only one remains, the second being misappropriated and removed to the neighbouring town of Lecce.

===Middle Ages and modern times===

Later, Brindisi was conquered by the Ostrogoths and reconquered by the Byzantine Empire in the 6th century AD. In 674, it was destroyed by the Lombards led by Romuald I of Benevento, but such a fine natural harbor meant that the city was soon rebuilt. In the 9th century, a Saracen settlement existed in the city&#x27;s neighborhood, stormed in 836 by pirates.

In 1070, it was conquered by the Normans and became part of the Principality of Taranto and the Duchy of Apulia, and was the first rule of the Counts of Conversano. After the baronial revolt of 1132, owned by the will of Roger II of Sicily, the city recovered some of the splendor of the past during the period of the Crusades, when it regained the Episcopal See, saw the construction of the new cathedral and a castle with an essential new arsenal, and became a privileged port for the Holy Land. In 1156, a siege of Brindisi by the Byzantine Empire ended in a battle in which the believers were decisively defeated by the Sicilian Normans, ending the Byzantines&#x27; hopes of conquering Southern Italy.

It was in the cathedral of Brindisi that the wedding of Norman Prince Roger III of Sicily took place, son of King Tancred of Sicily. Emperor Frederick II, the heir to the crown of Jerusalem and Isabella of Brienne (9 November 1225) started from the port of Brindisi in 1227 for the Sixth Crusade Frederick II erected a castle, with massive round towers, to guard the inner harbour; it later became a convict prison. Like other Pugliese ports, Brindisi, for a short while, was ruled by Venice, but was soon reconquered by Spain.

A plague devastated Brindisi in 1348; it was plundered in 1352 and 1383; and an earthquake struck the city in 1456.

Brindisi fell to Austrian rule in 1707–1734 and afterward to the Bourbons.

Between September 1943 and February 1944, the city functioned as Italy&#x27;s temporary government seat and hosted King Victor Emmanuel III, Pietro Badoglio, and a part of the Italian armed forces command in September 1943 after the armistice with Italy.

In the 21st century, Brindisi is the home base of the San Marco Regiment, a marine brigade originally known as the La Marina Regiment. It was renamed San Marco after its noted defense of Venice at the start of World War I.

On 19 May 2012, a bomb made of three gas cylinders, detonated in front of a vocational school in Brindisi, killing a 16-year-old female student.

==Geography==

Brindisi is situated on a natural harbour, that penetrates deeply into the Adriatic coast of Apulia. Within the arms of the outer harbour islands are Pedagne, a tiny archipelago, currently not open and in use for military purposes (United Nations Group Schools used it during the intervention in Bosnia). The entire municipality is part of the Brindisi Plain, characterised by high agricultural uses of its land. It is located in the northeastern part of the Salento plains, about from the Itria Valley and the low Murge. The Natural Marine Reserve of the World Wide Fund for Nature of Torre Guaceto is close to the city. The Ionian Sea is about away.

===Territory===
The territory of Brindisi is characterised by a wide flat area from which emerge sub-deposits of limestone and sand of marine origin, which in turn have a deeper level clay of the Pleistocene era and an even later Mesozoic carbonate composed of limestone and soils. The development of agriculture has caused an increase in the use of water resources, increasing indiscriminate use.

===Climate===
Brindisi experiences a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;). Summers are hot and dry with abundant sunshine. Summer heat indexes can be regularly over and occasionally as high as during July and August. Winters are mild with moderate rainfall. Brindisi and the mostly topographically flat Salento peninsula are subject to light winds most of the year. The two main winds in Salento are the Maestral and the Scirocco. The northerly Maestral wind from the Adriatic Sea is cooling, moderating summer heat and increasing winter wind chill. The southerly Scirocco wind from the Sahara brings higher temperatures and humidity to Salento. During spring and autumn, Sirocco winds can bring thunderstorms, occasionally dropping red sand from the Sahara in the region. Snow is rare in Brindisi but occurred during the January 2017 cold spell, bringing snow and ice to much of southern Italy.

==Main sights==
* The &quot;Castello Svevo&quot; or &quot;Castello Grande&quot; (&quot;Hohenstaufen Castle&quot; or &quot;Large Castle&quot;), built by Emperor Frederick II. It has a trapezoid plan with massive square towers. Under the Crown of Aragon four towers were added to the original 13th-century structure. After centuries of being abandoned, in 1813 Joachim Murat turned it into a prison; after 1909 it was used by the Italian Navy. During World War II it was briefly the residence of King Victor Emmanuel III.
* The Aragonese Castle, best known as &quot;Forte a Mare&quot; (&quot;Sea Fort&quot;). It was built by King Ferdinand I of Naples in 1491 on the S. Andrea island facing the port. It is divided into two sections: the &quot;Red Castle&quot; (from the color of its bricks) and the more recent Fort.
* Two ancient Roman pillars, symbols of Brindisi. They were once thought to mark the ending points of the Appian Way, instead they were used as a port reference for the antique mariners. Only one of the two, standing at , is still visible. The other crumbled in 1582, and the ruins were given to Lecce to hold the statue of Saint Oronzo (Lecce&#x27;s patron), because Saint Oronzo was reputed to have cured the plague in Brindisi.
* the &quot;Duomo&quot; (cathedral), built in Romanesque style in the 11th–12th centuries. What is visible today is the 18th-century reconstruction, after the original was destroyed by an earthquake on 20 February 1743. Parts of the original mosaic pavement can be seen in the interior.
* Church of &quot;Santa Maria del Casale&quot; (late 13th century), in Gothic-Romanesque style. The façade has a geometrical pattern of grey and yellow stones, with an entrance cusp-covered portico. The interior has early-14th-century frescoes including, in the counter-façade, a &quot;Last Judgement&quot; in four sections, by Rinaldo da Taranto. They are in late-Byzantine style.
* Church of San Benedetto, in Romanesque style. Perhaps built before the 11th century as part of a Benedictine nunnery, it has a massive bell tower with triple-mullioned windows and Lombard bands. A side portal is decorated with 11th-century motifs, while the interior has a nave covered by cross vaults, while the aisles, separated by columns with Romanesque capitals, have half-barrel vaults. The cloister (11th century) has decorated capitals.
* Portico of the Templars (13th century). Despite the name, it was in reality the loggia of the bishop&#x27;s palace. It is now the entrance to the Museo Ribezzo.
* the &quot;Fontana Grande&quot; (Grand Fountain), built by the Romans on the Appian Way. It was restored in 1192 by Tancred of Lecce.
* &quot;Piazza della Vittoria&quot; (Victory Square). It has a 17th-century fountain.
* Church of &quot;Santa Maria degli Angeli&quot; (1609).
* Church of the Sacred Heart.
* Church of &quot;San Giovanni al Sepolcro&quot;, with circular plan, dating from the 12th century.
* Church of the &quot;Santissima Trinità&quot; (or &quot;Santa Lucia&quot;, 14th century). It has a late 12th-century crypt.
* the 

===Natural areas===
Within the territory of the town of Brindisi environmental protected areas are located, some newly established:
* The Regional Natural Park of Punta della Contessa Salt: wetland of between Capo di Torre Cavallo and Punta della Contessa
* The Regional Nature Reserve Forest Cerano: a protected natural area that falls within the territory of Brindisi and San Pietro Vernotico;
* The Regional Nature Reserve Bosco of Santa Teresa and Lucci: it is a protected natural area composed of two forests whose name it bears. With the EU Directive 92/43 EEC, was included in the list of Sites of Community Importance (SCI) ;
* The Marine Nature Reserve Guaceto Tower: falling mostly in the municipality of Carovigno, are managed by a consortium which includes the municipalities of Brindisi, Carovigno and the WWF.
==Demography==
===Migration===
Brindisi has been the subject of extensive emigration during the 20th century, as well as all cities in the South. Emigration focused mainly on the lower strata of society who abandoned the countryside. Emigration can be traced in two great waves. The first, which was at its peak in the years immediately before and after the First World War, was almost exclusively to the Americas (and mostly to the United States, Argentina, and Brazil). The second wave of migrants from Apulia headed instead for Northern Europe after the Second World War. Attracted by the industrial development of some northern areas of the country, many Apulian migrants also settled in the Piedmont and Lombardy regions of northern Italy, and particularly in Milan. Since the 1960s, when the large petrochemical companies were joined by mechanical, naval, and aviation corporations, Brindisi was able to create employment opportunities for technicians and workers. The city experienced a small regional immigration, attracting families from neighboring provinces and regions.

Another important chapter in the demography of the town was the exodus of people from Albania in 1990–1991, which lasted almost a decade and led to the port of Brindisi receiving waves of Albanian immigrants.

===Ethnic groups===
The largest non-Italian ethnic community is Albanian. The number of those who decided to stay in the city, however, is negligible in light of the number of immigrants who migrated. Brindisi remains the first step towards western Europe for displaced people from the Balkans.

The large number of Americans is largely due to a U.S. Air Force station, between Brindisi and San Vito dei Normanni that operated throughout the second half of the 20th century. Although the base is no longer operational, many soldiers have decided to stay.

The British presence is the result of a recent phenomenon of families from Northern Europe, especially English and Irish, settling in the region. Many such settlers are pensioners, buying villas in the Brindisi countryside. This phenomenon is relatively recent in Apulia, known as &quot;Salentoshire&quot;, a playful neologism along the lines of &quot;Chiantishire&quot; on the consolidation of British tourism in Tuscany.

===Languages and dialects===
The Brindisi dialect is a variant of Salentino and, although there are minor differences between the various municipalities, the root remains unchanged. It is spoken not only in Brindisi, but in some towns of the province of Taranto. The Brindisi also affects some dialects north of Lecce in the south

===Religion===
Brindisi, along with Ostuni, is home of the Archdiocese of Brindisi-Ostuni (Archidioecesis Brundusina-Ostunensis in Latin), home of the Catholic Church suffragan of Archdiocese of Lecce and part of the ecclesiastical region of Apulia. The diocese was erected in the 4th century, its first bishop was St. Leucio of Alexandria. In the 9th century following the destruction of the city by the Saracens, the bishops established their residence in Oria. The bishop Theodosius was successful in recovering the relics of St Leucio at the end of the 9th and keeping them in a basicila he built on top of the martyrium of the saint. It was in the 10th century that established the Diocese of Ostuni, first joined the Diocese of Conversano-Monopoli and likely heir to the ancient diocese of Egnatia.

On 30 September 1986, by decree of the Congregation for Bishops, the Archdiocese of Brindisi and Ostuni diocese were united in the Archdiocese of Brindisi-Ostuni plena. The new diocese was recognized civilly 20 October 1986, by decree of the Ministry of Interior.
Brindisi contains an Eastern Orthodox Church parish, St. Nicholas of Myra Byzantine Rite. The rite of the Greek presence in Brindisi has long been established since the rule of the Byzantine Empire with a strong spread of the Basilian monks.
The Jews were a small but industrious community from 53 AD until the second half of the 16th century. The new Albanian migration has led to the recurrence of some Islamic religious presence.

==Culture==

===Traditions and folklore===
Significant in Brindisi is the cult of Tarantismo that combines pagan and Christian tradition. In the past it was believed that women who showed forms of hysteria were infected by the bite of a Lycosa tarantula. The only known remedy was to dance continuously for days, so that the poison did not cause greater effect. Through music and dance was created a real exorcism in musical character. Each time a tarantato exhibited symptoms associated with Taranto, the tambourine, fiddle, mandolin, guitar and accordion players went in the house of the tarantato and began to play the pinch music with frenetic rhythms. The Brindisi pinch, as opposed to Lecce, is devoid of Christian references and a therapeutic repertoire and musical detail.

===Education===
====Libraries====

The Provincial Library is a public library located in Commenda avenue. It has over 100,000 books and an extensive newspaper archive and participates in the National Library Service. Inside a modern auditorium, a media office and the secretariats of the university offices of Bari and Lecce operate. The Archbishop Annibale De Leo Library is a prestigious public library housed in the Seminary of Brindisi, in Piazza Duomo. Founded in 1798 by archbishop of Brindisi Annibale De Leo, with an endowment of about 6,000 volumes, today it has over 20,000 volumes, 17 incunable, over 200 16th-century manuscripts. These include some rare works, and various manuscript collections.

====University====
The University of Salento Brindisi has social sciences, politics and geography faculty with courses in Sociology, Social Services and Political Science.
The University of Bari has courses in Business Administration, Management and Consulting, Economics, Maritime and Logistics, Information Technology, Design, Nursing and Physiotherapy.

====Museums====
The &quot;F. Ribezzo&quot; Provincial Archaeological Museum is located in Piazza Duomo and has many large rooms, providing visitors with six sections: epigraphy, sculpture, the antiquarium, prehistoric, coins, medieval, modern and bronzes of Punta del Serrone.
The Giovanni Tarantini Diocesan Museum is newly established and is housed in the Palazzo del Seminario. It has a collection of paintings, statues, ornaments and vestments from the churches of the diocese. Particularly important is the silver embossed Ark that has the remains of St Theodore of Amasea and a 7th-century pitcher, in which one can recognize the wedding at Cana.
The Ethnic Salento Agrilandia Museum of Civilization offers tourists the chance to see many statues in wood and stone. It also features agriculture and interesting tools with the rural culture.

===Music and theatre===
Over the past decade the city has developed and consolidated non-amateur theater companies, some dealing with theater for research and actor training. These companies have developed several socio-cultural projects for the promotion of the theater for people with disabilities. The same group of companies has produced six shows.

The municipal theatre is the Teatro Verdi (New Verdi Theatre). It is located in the historical center of the city, and opened in 2006. In 2022, Stefano Miceli was appointed chairman of the theatre foundation. Under his guidance, the theater debuted its resident orchestra named Orchestra del Nuovo Teatro Verdi and its first symphonic concert season. During the same year the tenor Fabio Armiliato sang at the official inauguration of the first Verdi Gala at Nuovo Teatro Verdi, and new jazz and classical music festivals and international guests artists debuted at the theatre.

===Print===
As for the press, the &quot;La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno&quot; publishes the &quot;Brindisi Journal&quot;. Salento&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Nuovo Quotidiano di Puglia&quot; also covers Brindisi. &quot;Senzacolonne&quot;, which was founded in 2004, is the only one with a central editorial office in Brindisi.

===Television===
Brindisi is home to the television stations &quot;Teleradio Agricoltura Informazione&quot; and Puglia TV, which began broadcasts in January 1988 in Brindisi.

==Cuisine==
Brindisi&#x27;s cuisine is simple with basic ingredients used, starting with flour or unrefined barley, which is less expensive than wheat. Vegetables, snails, and bluefish figure prominently in its cuisine.
Among the recipes are &quot;Pettole&quot;(fried yeast dough, sweet or savory to taste stuffed maybe with cod or anchovy, with cauliflower or broccoli), &quot;Patani tajedda rice and mussels&quot; (rice, potatoes and mussels), soup, fish, mashed potatoes with fava beans, broad beans and mussels, and &quot;Racana mussels&quot;.

===Beverages, spirits, liquors===

Limoncello: a liquor made from the peel of fresh lemons and enriched with water, sugar and alcohol.

===Cheese===

Brindisi cheeses are mostly from sheep, due to the significant ranching of sheep and goats. In the summer they produce ricotta, which can be eaten fresh or matured for a few months so that it has a stronger flavor.
Typical of the winter season are the Pecorino, ricotta and strong ricotta (or cottage cheese). It is used to flavor spaghetti sauce or spread on bruschetta.
Fresh popular cheeses are burrata, junket, Manteca cheese, mozzarella or Fior di latte.

===Vegetable products, processed or unprocessed===
Vegetables are the true protagonist of the traditional diet of Salento. Depending on season, are the tops of turnips, various types of cabbage, the beet greens from the thistle, peppers, eggplant and zucchini (all served sun-dried or in olive oil), and artichokes. There are also wild vegetables used in traditional cooking such as chicory, dandelion (or zangune), wild asparagus, the Wild mustard, the thistle, the lampascioni also called pampasciuni or pampasciuli, and capers.
Frequent, in the Brindisi kitchen, is the use of green or white tomatoes: mainly used for tomato sauce but they are also consumed in olive oil, after a process of natural drying. Significant is also the consumption of green and black olives, crushed or in brine. Finally, legumes such as beans, peas and Vicia faba, eaten fresh or dried in the spring and during the winter season.
Among the dishes prepared with fruit are quince, baked figs and dried figs (prepared with a filling of almonds), jam with orange and lemon, and fig jam.

===Pasta, pastry and confectionery===
Pasta and bread is made with unrefined flour, and thus takes on a dark colour. Durum wheat is mixed with traditional meal. Special local dishes include lasagna with vegetables, cavatelli, orecchiette (stacchioddi in Brindisi dialect) and ravioli stuffed with ricotta.

In breadmaking, local custom favours the use of durum wheat, bread flour and barley bread. For bread made with yeast (called criscituni) and cooked on an oven stone, Brindisi bakers use bundles of olive branches to give the bread a particular scent. One type of traditional bread is made with olives (called puccia). It is made with a much more refined wheat flour than for ordinary bread, to which are added black olives.

Also important are frisella, a sort of dehydrated hard bread which can be stored for a long time, and tarallini, also easily stored for long periods. The pucce and uliate cakes are also typical.
Among local desserts the central place is occupied by almond paste, obtained by grinding shelled almonds and sugar. Another specialty is cartellate, a pastry, particularly prepared around Christmas, made of a thin strip of a dough made of flour, olive oil, and white wine that is wrapped upon itself, intentionally leaving cavities and openings, to form a sort of &quot;rose&quot; shape; the dough is then deep-fried, dried, and soaked in either lukewarm vincotto or honey.

===Wine===

* Susumaniello.

The Brindisi DOC produces both red and &quot;rose&quot; wines from grapes limited to a harvest yield of 15 tonnes/ha and must produce a wine with a minimum 12% alcohol level. The wines are usually blends made predominantly from Negaroamaro and Malvasia Nera but Sangiovese is allowed to compose up to 10% of the blend with Montepulciano allowed to compose up to another 20% (or 30% if Sangiovese is not included). If it is to be a &quot;Reserva&quot;, the wine is aged a minimum of 2 years before release and must attain a minimum alcohol level of 12.5%.

==Human geography==

===Roman period===
From an urban point of view [58] [59], the city&#x27;s earliest signs of human settlement are on the promontory of Punta Terre, a coastal area outside the port. As a Roman colony ( 244 BC ), the city experienced a major urban expansion that ensued economic and social development. According to Pliny the Elder, Brindisi was one of the most important Italian cities.

===Middle Ages===
During the Middle Ages, Brindisi suffered a sharp decline, after it was devastated by the Goths in the 6th century; Procopius describes it as a small city without defensive walls. The town shrank to a smaller area, probably around the San Leucio temple, outside the old town. The port was abandoned for several centuries. The rebirth came with the Byzantine domination (11th century ) and especially with the Normans and the Swabians (12th and 13th century), when it became a prime port for the Crusades. The city was divided into three districts or &quot;pittachi&quot;: Santo Stefano (in the vicinity of the columns), Eufemia (in Santa Teresa) and San Toma (in the area of Saint Lucia). Under the Aragonese and the Spanish kings, the main efforts were directed mainly around the ramparts (walls, castle and sea fort to provide relief from mostly the Greeks, Albanians and Slavs.

===Modern era===
Only through the reopening of the Pigott channel (1775), the city experienced a new impetus and reopened traffic with the East mainly due to the establishment of the Suez Canal at the end of the 19th century.

===Contemporary era===
Demographic development in the 20th century led to the modern city overlying the ancient one, at the cost of the demolition of the neighbourhoods around San Pietro degli Schiavoni, Teatro Verdi, and the Clock Tower. Today urban planning demands that settlements of significant architectural impact are built outside the city centre. The city has now expanded beyond the walls of the historic centre to form the new suburbs of Commando, Capuchins, Sant&#x27;Angelo (1950–1970 ) and St. Clare, St. Elias, and Bozzano (1980–2000).

==Economy==
The development of industry led to radical changes in the Brindisi economy and consequent development along the coast. Taking advantage of the location of the port, Brindisi is also a major seaport for Greece and Turkey.

===Agriculture===
Brindisi agriculture includes horticulture, viticulture, fruit and olives. The area that marked the territory for centuries is based on the culture of almonds, olives, tobacco, artichokes, and grain. Livestock consists of cattle, goats and sheep.

===Industry===
Industry in Brindisi is mainly identified with the chemical and aerospace industry.

====Chemical====
The chemical industry, in its various forms (food processing, energy, and pharmaceutical) is highly developed in the territory of Brindisi. The Federchimica association recognizes Brindisi as an industrial chemical center.

The various establishments of Eni, located as Polimeri Europa, Snam and EniPower are placed in the petrochemical complex of Brindisi, on the outskirts of the city, overlooking the Adriatic Sea.

====Energy production====
Brindisi is a leader in the production of electricity in Italy. ENEL Federico II is a power plant on 4 sections divided by polycombustible thermoelectric power of 660 MW each, came into service between 1991 and 1993. Edipower Brindisi, located in Costa Morena, in the industrial area of Brindisi. Central EniPower Brindisi is a combined cycle power plant EniPower, once completed, with an installed capacity of 1,170 megawatts, will be the most powerful among those of the Eni Company. Regasification terminal at Brindisi, the construction of a regasification terminal by the company&#x27;s &quot;Brindisi LNG SpA. will heat the area of Porto Exterior, called Capobianco. The authorization process is currently in the process of completion of the national Environmental Impact Assessment, initiated by the company in January 2008. Photovoltaic system, the largest in Europe photovoltaic park (with power of 11 MWp ), which should start operating in 2010, at the former petrochemical site. The industry group responsible for the construction will be joined by the University of Apulia.

====Aviation====
The Alenia Aeronautica plants (specialized in the modification of aircraft from passenger configuration to cargo) are located in Brindisi. Avio (center for military engines) and Agusta (production of helicopter metal structures) are also located there.

===Tourism===

The city preserves important archaeological finds and coastline, particularly the north coast, where there are many large sand dunes and beaches. Inland agritourism, displays wine (Wine Appia) or olive oil (Collina di Brindisi oil). Brindisi Tourism, however, remains heavily dependent on the Italian tourists (74%, compared with 26% of foreign demand) and is very seasonal.

==Infrastructure and transport==

===Roads===
The main roads are represented by
* Bari-Lecce expressway, connecting with Brindisi, Lecce, with Bari and the A14.
* Adriatica SS 16 is the Brindisi bypass connecting the city to San Vito dei Normanni and Lecce * Brindisi-Taranto Brindisi with Taranto.

===Railways===
Rail transport is provided through Brindisi railway station, an important Apulian railway junction and an intersecting point between the Adriatic Railway and the Taranto–Brindisi railway. The station is managed by Centostazioni, and links Brindisi with all destinations served by the Adriatic and Ionian coastal railways. Brindisi Marittima railway station closed in 2006.

===Seaport===
The port of Brindisi has always been at the center of trade with Greece. It is one of the most important commercial and industrial seaports on the Adriatic Sea. The trade is mostly in coal, fuel oil, natural gas, and chemicals.
The port consists of three parts:
* The Outer Harbour: the limits of which are in the southern mainland, east of the Pedagne islands and west of the island from the pier in Costa
* The port is formed by the average area of sea that is before the Pigott Channel, access to the inner harbor, the basin to the north as the Strait of Apulia.
* The inner harbor is formed by two long wings that touch the heart of Brindisi both the north and east, they are the &quot;bosom of the west&quot; and &quot;within the east.&quot;

===International airport===
Brindisi is home to Papola-Casale Airport located outside the city&#x27;s center. The airport of Brindisi has daily connections with major Italian and European cities. The airport serves the entire province of Brindisi and partly that of Taranto. In 2017, a total of 2,321,147 passengers passed through.
It has two runways, one northwest to southeast that is long, and the other northeast to southwest that is long. Their characteristics allow the landing of large transport aircraft such as the Antonov An-124 and Boeing 747.

This airport was originally established as a military airbase in the 1920s. As of 2008 it has officially changed its legal status into civilian airport, still maintaining the military facilities attached to it. These are identified as &quot;Military Airport Orazio Pierozzi&quot;, named in memory of an Italian airman of the First World War.

The strategic position of the airport in the Mediterranean region, along with its natural potential for multi-modal (the port is a few kilometers away) operations, have made it a base of crucial importance for both national defense and NATO. For the same strategic reasons, in 1994 the airport was chosen as the main worldwide logistics base by the United Nations to support its peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations around the globe, which was since then hosted in Pisa Military Airport &quot;San Giusto&quot;. In 2000, also the United Nations humanitarian supply depot moved from Pisa to Brindisi. It has since then been managed by the World Food Programme and officially known as the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD). On behalf of governments, other UN agencies and NGOs, from UNHRD Brindisi humanitarian aid is directed to the most remote and devastated regions around the world.

===Public transport===
The Public Transport Company of Brindisi provides public transport in the city, and is the link with the other municipalities in the province. Moreover, the company provides transport service by sea into inland waters of the port of Brindisi. Brindisi is also a major ferry port, with routes to Greece and elsewhere.

<text>The Middle Passage was the stage of the Atlantic slave trade in which millions of enslaved Africans were forcibly transported to the Americas as part of the triangular slave trade. Ships departed Europe for African markets with manufactured goods (first side of the triangle), which were then traded for slaves with rulers of African states and other African slave traders. Slave ships transported the slaves across the Atlantic (second side of the triangle). The proceeds from selling slaves were then used to buy products such as furs and hides, tobacco, sugar, rum, and raw materials, which would be transported back to Europe (third side of the triangle) to complete the triangle.

The First Passage was the forced march of African slaves from their inland homes, where they had been captured by other African states or by other members of their own ethnic group, to African ports where they were imprisoned until they were sold and loaded onto a ship. The Final Passage was the journey from the port of disembarkation in the Americas to the plantation or other destination where they would be put to work. The Middle Passage across the Atlantic joined these two. Voyages on the Middle Passage were large financial undertakings, generally organized by companies or groups of investors rather than individuals.

The first European slave ship transported enslaved Africans from São Tomé to New Spain in 1525. Portuguese and Dutch traders dominated the trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, though by the 18th they were supplanted by the British and French. Other European nations involved were Spain, Denmark–Norway, Sweden, Poland–Lithuania, Prussia, and various Italian city-states as well as traders from the United States. The enslaved Africans came mostly from the regions of Senegambia, Upper Guinea, Windward Coast, Gold Coast, Bight of Benin, Bight of Biafra, and Angola. With the growing abolitionist movement in Europe and the Americas, the transatlantic slave trade gradually declined until being fully abolished in the second-half of the 19th century.

According to modern research, roughly 15 million enslaved people were transported through the Middle Passage to the Americas. The enslaved were transported in wretched conditions, men and women separated, across the Atlantic. Mortality was high; those with strong bodies survived. Young women and girls were raped by the crew. An estimated 19% of them died during voyage, with mortality rates considerably higher in Africa itself during the process of capturing and transporting slaves to the coast. The total number of deaths directly attributable to the Middle Passage voyage is estimated at up to two million; a broader look at African deaths directly attributable to the institution of slavery from 1500 to 1900 suggests up to four million deaths. The &quot;Middle Passage&quot; was considered a time of in-betweenness where captive Africans forged bonds of kinship, which then created forced transatlantic communities.

==Journey==


The duration of the transatlantic voyage varied widely, from one to six months depending on weather conditions. The journey became more efficient over the centuries: while an average transatlantic journey of the early 16th century lasted several months, by the 19th century the crossing often required fewer than five to seven weeks.

African kings, warlords, and private kidnappers sold captives to Europeans who held several coastal forts. The captives were usually force-marched to these ports along the western coast of Africa, where they were held for sale to the European or American slave traders in the barracoons. Typical slave ships contained several hundred slaves with about 30 crew members.

The male captives were normally chained together in pairs to save space; right leg to the next man&#x27;s left leg—while the women and children may have had somewhat more room. The chains or hand and leg cuffs were known as bilboes, which were among the many tools of the slave trade, and which were always in short supply. Bilboes were mainly used on men, and they consisted of two iron shackles locked on a post and were usually fastened around the ankles of two men. At best, captives were fed beans, corn, yams, rice, and palm oil. Slaves were fed one meal a day with water, if at all. When food was scarce, slaveholders would get priority over the slaves. Sometimes captives were allowed to move around during the day, but many ships kept the shackles on throughout the arduous journey. Aboard certain French ships, the enslaved were brought on deck to periodically receive fresh air. While the enslaved females were typically permitted to be on deck more frequently, enslaved males would be watched closely to prevent revolt when above deck.

The enslaved below the decks lived for months in conditions of squalor and indescribable horror. Disease spread, and ill health was one of the biggest killers. Mortality rates were high, and death made these conditions below the decks even worse. Even though the corpses were thrown overboard, many crew members avoided going into the hold. The enslaved who had already been ill were not always found immediately. Many of the living enslaved could have been shackled to someone that was dead for hours and sometimes days.

Most contemporary historians estimate that between 9.4 and 12.6 million Africans embarked for the New World. Disease and starvation due to the length of the passage were the main contributors to the death toll with amoebic dysentery and scurvy causing the majority of deaths. Additionally, outbreaks of smallpox, syphilis, measles, and other diseases spread rapidly in the close-quarter compartments.

The rate of death increased with the length of the voyage, since the incidence of dysentery and of scurvy increased with longer stints at sea as the quality and amount of food and water diminished. In addition to physical sickness, many of the enslaved became too depressed to eat or function efficiently due to loss of freedom, family, security, and their own humanity.

===Sailing technologies===
The need for profits in the 18th-century Atlantic market economy drove changes in ship designs and in managing human cargo, which included enslaved Africans and the mostly European crew. Improvements in air flow on board the ships helped to decrease the infamous mortality rate that these ships had become known for throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The new designs that allowed ships to navigate faster and into rivers&#x27; mouths ensured access to many more enslaving posts along the West African coast. The monetary value of enslaved Africans on any given American auction-block during the mid-18th century ranged between $800 and $1,200, which in modern times would be equivalent to $32,000–48,000 per person ($100 then is now worth $4,000 due to inflation). Therefore, ship captains and investors sought technologies that would protect their human cargo.

Throughout the height of the Atlantic slave trade (1570–1808), ships that transported the enslaved were normally smaller than traditional cargo ships, with most ships that transported the enslaved, weighing between 150 and 250 tons. This equated to about 350 to 450 enslaved Africans on each slave ship, or 1.5 to 2.4 per ton. The English ships of the time normally fell on the larger side of this spectrum and the French on the smaller side. Ships purposely designed to be smaller and more maneuverable were meant to navigate the African coastal rivers into farther inland ports; these ships therefore increased the effects of the slave trade on Africa. Additionally, the ships&#x27; sizes increased slightly throughout the 1700s; however the number of enslaved Africans per ship remained the same. This reduction in the ratio of enslaved Africans to ship tonnage was designed to increase the amount of space per person and thus improve the survival chances of everyone on board. These ships also had temporary storage decks that were separated by an open latticework or grate bulkhead. Ship masters would presumably use these chambers to divide enslaved Africans and help prevent mutiny. Some ships developed by the turn of the 19th century even had ventilation ports built into the sides and between gun ports (with hatches to keep inclement weather out). These open deck designs increased airflow and thus helped improve survival rates, diminishing potential investment losses.

Another major factor in &quot;cargo protection&quot; was the increase in knowledge of diseases and medicines (along with the inclusion of a variety of medicines on the ships). First the Dutch East India Company in the 18th century, followed by some other countries and companies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, realized that the inclusion of surgeons and other medical practitioners aboard their ships was an endeavor that proved too costly for the benefits. So instead of including medical personnel they just stocked the ships with a large variety of medicines. While this was better than no medicines, and given the fact that many crew members at least had some idea of how disease was spread, without the inclusion of medical personnel the mortality rate was still very high in the 18th century.

===Treatment of enslaved people and resistance===
Treatment of the enslaved was horrific due to the captured African men and women being considered less than human; to slavers, they were &quot;cargo&quot;, or &quot;goods&quot;, and treated as such. Women with children were not as desirable for enslavement for they took up too much space, and toddlers were not wanted because of everyday maintenance. For example, the &quot;Zong&quot;, a British slave ship, took too many enslaved on a voyage to the New World in 1781. Overcrowding combined with malnutrition and disease killed several crew members and around 60 enslaved. Bad weather made the &quot;Zong&quot; voyage slow and lack of drinking water became a concern. The crew decided to drown some slaves at sea, to conserve water and allow the owners to collect insurance for lost cargo. About 130 slaves were killed and a number chose to kill themselves in defiance, by jumping into the water willingly. The &quot;Zong&quot; incident became fuel for the abolitionist movement and a major court case, as the insurance company refused to compensate for the loss.

While the enslaved were kept fed and supplied with drink as healthy slaves were more valuable, if resources ran low on the long, unpredictable voyages, the crew received preferential treatment. Punishment of the enslaved and torture was very common, as on the voyage the crew had to turn independent people into obedient enslaved. Pregnant women on the ships who delivered their babies aboard risked the chance of their children being killed in order for the mothers to be sold. The worst punishments were for rebelling; in one instance a captain punished a failed rebellion by killing one involved enslaved man immediately, and forcing two other slaves to eat his heart and liver.

As a way to counteract disease and suicide attempts, the crew would force the enslaved onto the deck of the ship for exercise, usually resulting in beatings because the enslaved would be unwilling to dance for them or interact. These beatings would often be severe and could result in the enslaved dying or becoming more susceptible to diseases.

====Suicide====
Slaves resisted in many ways. The two most common types of resistance were refusal to eat and suicide. Suicide was a frequent occurrence, often by refusal of food or medicine or jumping overboard, as well as by a variety of other opportunistic means. If an enslaved person jumped overboard, they would often be left to drown or shot from the boat. Over the centuries, some African peoples, such as the Kru, came to be understood as holding substandard value as slaves, because they developed a reputation for being too proud to be enslaved, and for attempting suicide immediately upon losing their freedom.

Both suicide and self-starving were prevented as much as possible by slaver crews; the enslaved were often force-fed or tortured until they ate, though some still managed to starve themselves to death; the enslaved were kept away from means of suicide, and the sides of the deck were often netted. The enslaved were still successful, especially at jumping overboard. Often when an uprising failed, the mutineers would jump &quot;en masse&quot; into the sea. Slaves generally believed that if they jumped overboard, they would be returned to their family and friends in their village or to their ancestors in the afterlife.

Suicide by jumping overboard was such a problem that captains had to address it directly in many cases. They used the sharks that followed the ships as a terror weapon. One captain, who had a rash of suicides on his ship, took a woman and lowered her into the water on a rope, and pulled her out as fast as possible. When she came in view, the sharks had already killed her—and bitten off the lower half of her body.

====Identity and communication====
In order to interact with each other on the voyage, the enslaved created a communication system unbeknownst to Europeans: They would construct choruses on the passages using their voices, bodies, and ships themselves; the hollow design of the ships allowed the enslaved to use them as percussive instruments and to amplify their songs. This combination of &quot;instruments&quot; was both a way for the enslaved to communicate as well as creating a new identity since slavers attempted to strip them of that. Although most of the enslaved were from various regions around Africa, their situation allowed them to come together and create a new culture and identity aboard the ships with a common language and method of communication:

[C]all and response soundings allowed men and women speaking different languages to communicate about the conditions of their captivity. In fact, on board the &quot;Hubridas&quot;, what began as murmurs and morphed into song erupted before long into the shouts and cries of coordinated revolt.

This communication was a direct subversion of European authority and allowed the enslaved to have a form of power and identity otherwise prohibited. Furthermore, such organization and coming together enabled revolts and uprisings to actually be coordinated and successful at times.

====Uprisings====
Aboard ships, the captives were not always willing to follow orders. Sometimes they reacted in violence. Slave ships were designed and operated to try to prevent the slaves from revolting. Resistance among the slaves usually ended in failure and participants in the rebellion were punished severely. About one out of ten ships experienced some sort of rebellion.

Ottobah Cugoano, who was enslaved and taken from Africa as a child, later described an uprising aboard the ship on which he was transported to the West Indies:

When we found ourselves at last taken away, death was more preferable than life, and a plan was concerted amongst us, that we might burn and blow up the ship, and to perish all together in the flames.

The number of rebels varied widely; often the uprisings would end with the death of a few slaves and crew. Surviving rebels were punished or executed as examples to the other slaves on board.

====African religion====
The enslaved also resisted through certain manifestations of their religions and mythology. They would appeal to their gods for protection and vengeance upon their captors, and would also try to curse and otherwise harm the crew using idols and fetishes. One crew found fetishes in their water supply, placed by the enslaved who believed they would kill all who drank from it.

===Sailors and crew===
While the owners and captains of slave ships could expect vast profits, the ordinary sailors were often inadequately paid and subject to brutal discipline. Sailors often had to live and sleep without shelter on the open deck for the entirety of the Atlantic voyage as the entire space below deck was occupied by enslaved people.

A crew mortality rate of around 20% was expected during a voyage, with sailors dying as a result of disease (specifically malaria and yellow fever), flogging or slave uprisings. A high crew mortality rate on the return voyage was in the captain&#x27;s interests as it reduced the number of sailors who had to be paid on reaching the home port. Crew members who survived were frequently cheated out of their wages on their return.

The sailors were often employed through coercion as they generally knew about and hated the slave trade. In port towns, recruiters and tavern owners would induce sailors to become very drunk (and indebted) and then offer to relieve their debt if they signed contracts with slave ships. If they did not, they would be imprisoned. Sailors in prison had a hard time getting jobs outside of the slave ship industry since most other maritime industries would not hire &quot;jail-birds&quot;, so they were forced to go to the slave ships anyway.

<doc id="392283" wikidata="Q1428728" url="?curid=392283" title="Sukhoi Su-2">
<text>The Sukhoi Su-2 () is a Soviet reconnaissance and light bomber aircraft used in the early stages of World War II. It was the first airplane designed by Pavel Sukhoi. The basic design received an engine and armament upgrade (Su-4) and was modified for the ground-attack role (ShB).

==Development==
In 1936, Joseph Stalin released a requirement for a multipurpose combat aircraft. Codenamed Ivanov, the airplane had to be capable of performing reconnaissance and then attacking the targets it located. P. O. Sukhoi was working in the Tupolev OKB at the time and designed the &quot;Ivanov&quot; aircraft under the tutelage of Andrei Tupolev. The resulting ANT-51 flew on 25 August 1937 with M. M. Gromov at the controls. Powered by a 610 kW (820 hp) Shvetsov M-62 air-cooled radial engine, the ANT-51 reached 403 km/h (220 kn, 250 mph) at 4,700 m (15,420 ft). This was considered insufficient but since the basic design was sound, it was decided to re-test it with a more powerful engine. Equipped with a 746 kW (1,000 hp) Tumansky M-87 engine, the ANT-51 reached 468 km/h (255 kn, 290 mph) at 5,600 m (18,370 ft) and was accepted into production as BB-1 (&quot;Blizhniy Bombardirovschik&quot;; — &quot;short-range bomber&quot;). In 1940, the aircraft was renamed Su-2 and the unreliable M-87 engine was replaced with a Tumansky M-88. This lightened version with an M-88B engine reached 512 km/h (275 kn, 320 mph) in testing.

The Su-2 was of mixed construction. The fuselage was semi-monocoque with wood spars and a plywood skin. The wings were of duralumin and steel construction with fabric-covered rod-actuated control surfaces. The pilot and gunner were protected with 9 mm (0.35 in) of armor. The taildragger landing gear was retractable, including the tailwheel.

==Operational history==

Although 910 Su-2s were built by the time production was discontinued in 1942, the aircraft was obsolete and underarmed by the start of the Great Patriotic War. In combat, the Su-2 ground attack aircraft squadrons suffered heavy losses against the Germans, with some 222 aircraft destroyed. From 1942, the Su-2 was withdrawn from the frontline and replaced by Ilyushin Il-2, Petlyakov Pe-2 and Tupolev Tu-2 bombers. The Su-2 was relegated to a training and reconnaissance role. However, due to a critical shortage of aircraft in early World War II, some Su-2s were used as emergency fighters.

===Loss rate comparison===
Although the Su-2 has been criticized due to the number of losses it suffered, its loss rate compares favorably with other attack aircraft used by the Soviet Airforce in World War II.

== Variants ==

Su-2
:Two-seat light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. Original designation BB-1.

ShB ()
:A proposed ground-attack version with an M-88A engine, modified landing gear which rotated 90° before retracting to the rear into the wings (like the American Curtiss P-40). Bombload was increased to 600 kg (1,235 lb). Created in 1940, the aircraft did not enter production due to availability of the Ilyushin Il-2.

Su-4 
:An upgraded version, originally intended for the Urmin M-90 engine with 1,565 kW (2,100 hp), but later fitted with a Shvetsov M-82 (some Su-2s were also fitted with M-82). Due to a shortage of duralumin, the structural elements of the wings were made of wood with plywood skin. Wing armament was changed from four 7.62 mm ShKAS machine guns to two 12.7 mm Berezin UB machine guns. One prototype was built and tested, but this improved version was not placed into production.

<text>José Eduardo Van-Dúnem dos Santos (; 28 August 1942 – 8 July 2022) was an Angolan politician and military officer who served as the second president of Angola from 1979 to 2017. As president, dos Santos was also the commander-in-chief of the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) and president of the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the party that has ruled Angola since it won independence in 1975. By the time he stepped down in 2017, he was the second-longest-serving president in Africa, surpassed only by Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea.

Dos Santos joined the MPLA, then an anti-colonial movement, while still in school, and earned degrees in petroleum engineering and radar communications while studying in the Soviet Union. Following the Angolan War of Independence, Angola was constituted in 1975 as a Marxist–Leninist one-party state led by the MPLA. Dos Santos held several positions including Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of independent Angola&#x27;s first president, Agostinho Neto.

After Neto&#x27;s death in 1979, dos Santos was elected by the MPLA as the country&#x27;s new president, supported by the Soviet Union and inheriting a civil war against Western-backed anti-communist rebels, most notably UNITA. By 1991, his government agreed with rebels to introduce a multi-party system, while changing the MPLA&#x27;s ideology from communism to social democracy. He was elected president in the 1992 Angolan general election over UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, and presided over free-market economic liberalization and the development of Angola&#x27;s oil sector. In 1997, he contributed to a rebel invasion of neighboring Zaire during the First Congo War, leading to the overthrow of Congolese UNITA ally Mobutu Sese Seko and the installation of Laurent-Désiré Kabila as President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo later that year. During the Second Congo War from 1998 to 2003 he supported Kabila&#x27;s government and later that of his son Joseph against several rebel groups loosely allied with UNITA. The MPLA achieved victory in the civil war by 2002 following Savimbi&#x27;s death. After winning a second presidential term in the 2012 election, he retired from the presidency in 2017, succeeded by party-mate João Lourenço as president.

A controversial figure, dos Santos received many international awards for his commitment to anti-colonialism and promotion of peace negotiation with rebels to end wars, and was praised for attracting significant foreign investment to Angola&#x27;s economy. He was criticized as having been a dictator and was accused of creating one of the most corrupt regimes in Africa, with a deeply-entrenched patronage network.

==Early life and education==
José Eduardo Van-Dúnem dos Santos was born on 28 August 1942 in what is today the district of Sambizanga in Luanda, His parents, Avelino Eduardo dos Santos and Jacinta José Paulino, had moved to Portuguese Angola from the then-colony of Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe. His mother was a maid, while his father was a builder and construction worker. His eldest sister, Isabel Eduardo dos Santos raised Manuel Vicente, under Dos Santos later Vice President of Angola. Dos Santos cousin Fernando da Piedade Dias dos Santos was prime minister of Angola from 2002 to 2008.

He attended primary school in Luanda, and received his secondary education at the Liceu Salvador Correia, today called Mutu ya Kevela.

While in school, dos Santos joined the MPLA, which marked the beginning of his political career. Due to repression by the colonial government, dos Santos went into exile in neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville in 1961. From there he collaborated with the MPLA and soon became an official member of the party. 

To continue with his education he moved to Azerbaijan, which was Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union, where, by 1969, he received degrees in petroleum engineering and radar communications from the Azerbaijan Oil and Chemistry Institute in Baku.

==Career==
In 1970, dos Santos returned to Angola, which was still a Portuguese territory known as the Overseas Province of Angola. He served for three years in the MPLA&#x27;s EPLA guerrilla force (&quot;Exército Para a Libertação de Angola&quot;), later known as the People&#x27;s Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA), the military wing of the MPLA, becoming a radio transmitter in the second political-military region of the MPLA in Cabinda Province. In 1974, he was promoted to sub-commander of the telecoms service of the second region. He was the MPLA representative to Yugoslavia, Zaire, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China before he was elected to the Central Committee and Politburo of the MPLA in Moxico in September 1974.

===Early political positions, 1975-1979===

In June 1975, dos Santos became coordinator of the MPLA&#x27;s Department of Foreign Affairs and of the MPLA&#x27;s Department of Health. Upon Angolan independence in November 1975, the MPLA held power in Luanda, but the new MPLA government faced a civil war with the other political formations, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA). The same year, dos Santos was appointed as Angola&#x27;s first Minister of Foreign Affairs upon independence, and in this capacity he played a key role in obtaining diplomatic recognition for the MPLA government in 1975–1976. At the MPLA&#x27;s First Congress in December 1977, dos Santos was re-elected to the Central Committee and Politburo. In December 1978, he was moved from the post of First Deputy Prime Minister in the government to that of Minister of Planning.

After the natural death of Angola&#x27;s first president, Agostinho Neto, on 10 September 1979, dos Santos was elected president of the MPLA on 20 September 1979, and took office as President of Angola and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces on 21 September. In the first Angolan parliamentary election on 9 November 1980 he was elected President of the People&#x27;s Assembly of Angola as a one-party state.

===Peace process, 1980-2002===

The biggest issue dos Santos had to cope with was the ongoing conflict with the main rival liberation movement, the National Union for the Total Integration of Angola (UNITA). UNITA, led by Jonas Savimbi and supported by South Africa and the United States, never fully recognized the legitimacy of MPLA as the ruling government of Angola and triggered several armed conflicts over the years to express its opposition. The war was also marked by intense foreign intervention, since the Soviet Union and Cuba backed the MPLA government and the U.S. and South Africa supported UNITA as a way to limit the expansion of Soviet influence in Africa. From 1989 until 1991, the United Nations Angola Verification Mission I and from 1991 until 1995, the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II took place.

On 29 and 30 September 1992, after 16 years of fighting that killed up to 300,000 people, general elections were held in Angola, under United Nations supervision. Dos Santos led the field in the first round with 49%; his main rival, Jonas Savimbi, won 40%. Under a constitution adopted earlier that year, since dos Santos finished just short of an outright majority, he would need to win a runoff election against Savimbi to become Angola&#x27;s first constitutional president. This second round never took place, as UNITA declared it did not recognize the election. 

A three-day war ensued, during which the Halloween Massacre occurred, when MPLA forces killed tens of thousands of UNITA protestors nationwide. Savimbi then decided to give up on the elections, alleging voting fraud, and immediately resumed the civil war. Meanwhile, dos Santos remained in office.

In 1993, while Savimbi and UNITA refused to give up territory won through battle, the United States, involved in settling peace talks between the two rival parties and leaders in order to work out a power sharing arrangement, decided to withdraw its support from UNITA and officially recognize dos Santos and the MPLA government as the official ruling body in Angola.

The death of UNITA&#x27;s leader Jonas Savimbi in February 2002 enabled the resumption of the peace process. On 4 April 2002, the Angolan Army and the rebels agreed to a ceasefire and peace was officially declared on 2 August 2002. While recognized as an official political party by the Angolan government, UNITA agreed to demobilize its armed forces, made up of 50,000 fighters, and agreed for them to be integrated into the national security forces. Following that decision, the UN Security Council reopened United Nations offices in Angola and established the United Nations Mission in Angola (UNMA), aimed at consolidating peace in the country.

===Governance issues after end of civil war 2001-2016===

In 2001, dos Santos announced that he would step down at the next presidential election. In December 2003 he was reelected as head of the MPLA and no further presidential election took place, despite their announcements for 2006, then 2007, and finally 2009. In August 2006, he obtained a MoU with the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda. 

After the 2008 Angolan parliamentary election the ruling MPLA won a landslide victory, and it started working on a new constitution which was introduced early in 2010. Under the terms of the new constitution, the president is elected by first-past-the-post double simultaneous vote for the same term as the assembly, and may serve a maximum of two terms. Each participating party nominates a presidential candidate as top of its list, who must be clearly identified on the ballot paper. The top candidate of the party receiving the most votes is elected president.

Dos Santos reportedly escaped an assassination attempt on 24 October 2010, when a vehicle tried to intercept his car as he was returning from the beach with his family. His escort opened fire, killing two passengers in the vehicle, and weapons were found on board. This incident has not been confirmed by any other source. In February–March 2011, and then again in September 2011, demonstrations against dos Santos were organized in Luanda by young Angolans, mostly via the Internet.

In the 2012 legislative election, his party, the MPLA, won more than two-thirds of the vote. As dos Santos had been the top candidate of the party, he automatically became president, in line with the constitution adopted in 2010.

In September 2014, dos Santos announced the end of the coupling of the position of provincial governor with provincial first secretary of the MPLA. This measure aimed to improve the operation of the provincial administration and the municipal administrations, as a way to adjust the governance model to a new context and bigger demand for public services.

===Economy===
Once a Marxist-Leninist, dos Santos allowed a partial market economy to emerge as the collapse of the Soviet Union was in progress. Dos Santos subsequently abandoned Marxism-Leninism completely and allowed Western firms to invest in Angola&#x27;s major oil fields. Angola became Africa&#x27;s second-largest oil producer and third-largest diamond producer during dos Santos&#x27; tenure in office. In November 2006, dos Santos co-founded the African Countries Diamond Producers Association, an organization of approximately 20 African nations founded to promote market cooperation and foreign investment in the African diamond industry. 

Despite the country&#x27;s natural resources, most Angolans remained in poverty: At the time of dos Santos&#x27; death in 2022, a few years after he left office, more than half of the more than 30 million Angolans subsisted on less than US$1.90 a day. Dos Santos oversaw a kleptocracy with vast amounts of wealth diverted to the dos Santos family; In 2020, dos Santos&#x27;s successor, João Lourenço, estimated that more than $24 billion was stolen or misappropriated under dos Santos, allegedly through diversion of oil revenue, patronage, and government contracts.

=== Succession, 2016-2017===

Dos Santos announced on 11 March 2016 that he planned to retire in 2018. This timetable would mean that he would leave office after the next election, scheduled for 2017. In December 2016, the MPLA chose João Lourenço, the Minister of Defense and Vice-President of the MPLA, as the party&#x27;s top candidate and therefore its presidential candidate for the 2017 legislative election, indicating that dos Santos would step aside prior to 2018. Dos Santos stated on 3 February 2017 that he would leave office following the election later in 2017, with Lourenço slated to succeed him. He remained President of the MPLA and was therefore expected to continue playing a key role at the top of Angolan politics through the leadership of the ruling party. His children Isabel dos Santos and José Filomeno dos Santos held key economic posts at Sonangol and the Fundo Soberano de Angola, respectively, suggesting their father retained considerable influence.

===Controversial issues===
Dos Santos led one of the most corrupt regimes in Africa by ignoring the economic and social needs of Angola and focusing his efforts on amassing wealth for his family and silencing his opposition, while nearly 70% of the population lived on less than $2 a day.

Dos Santos became wealthy when he first took power, and began amassing larger assets during and after the Angolan civil wars. When the ceasefire occurred and large portions of the economy were partially privatized, he took several emerging companies and industries. He helped arrange similar takeovers of several other natural resource industries. According to Transparency International, Angola had a reputation as one of the world&#x27;s most corrupt countries by the end of Dos Santos&#x27; reign.

Eventually the Angolan Parliament made it illegal for the president to have financial holdings in companies and organizations. In response to this, dos Santos supposedly began arranging for his daughter to receive the financial kickbacks and assets from these companies. Dos Santos then began using the government to take direct control of stakes in companies offered as kickbacks which he indirectly controlled and reaped the benefits of and managed to retain large corporate assets through proxies.

In what has become known as the &quot;Luanda Leaks&quot;, a vast network of more than 400 banks, companies, and consultants was revealed to have engaged in money-laundering for the dos Santos family. Among others, these include firms such as Banco BIC, founded by dos Santos family billionaire associate Américo Amorim, Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey &amp; Company,PwC, Eurobic, and a shell company called Athol Limited. According to Angolan media reports, Brave Ventures, a firm run by Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier, was also implicated in money-laundering activities in its role as a subcontractor for a French consulting firm tasked by dos Santos to oversee the development of the public health system.

Along with this, the government budget had grown over a decade to 69 billion dollars in 2012 through oil revenues. The International Monetary Fund reported that 32 billion in oil revenue went missing from the government&#x27;s ledger before it was found spent on &quot;quasi-fiscal activities&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Dos Santos, apart from Portuguese, also fluent in Spanish, French, and Russian, amassed a significant personal fortune.

===Marriages and relationships, the dos Santos clan===
José Eduardo dos Santos was married at least twice, and possibly as many as four marriages, depending on the source. He had at least six children from his wives, and one born out of wedlock.

His first wife was the Russian-born geologist Tatiana Kukanova, whom he met while studying in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (present-day Azerbaijan). Dos Santos and Kukanova had one daughter, Isabel dos Santos (b. 1973), who was at one time the richest woman in Africa. Their marriage ended in divorce.

His next two marriages (or long-term relationships, depending on the source) also ended in divorce or separation as well. With his second wife, Filomena Sousa, he had one child, José Filomeno dos Santos, known as &quot;Zenú&quot; (b. 1978), who served as chairman of Fundo Soberano de Angola. 

His third wife was Maria Luísa Abrantes Perdigão. Abrantes&#x27; and dos Santos&#x27; two children were daughter, Welwitschia &quot;Tchize&quot; dos Santos (b. 1978), and a son, the Angolan artist Coréon Dú (b. 1984). Maria Luísa Abrantes served as Minister of Finance from June 1990 to April 1992.

In 1991, dos Santos married his fourth and final wife, Ana Paula de Lemos, a former flight attendant and model. They had three children: Eduane Danilo (b. 1991), Joseana (b. 1995), and Eduardo (b. 1998). The couple remained married until his death in 2022. As of 2017, Eduane Danilo was a partner in an Angolan financial institution named Banco Postal, holding stock in a private holding company called ‘Deana Day Spa’ and was entrusted with the privatization of Angola Telecom.
===Later life===
In mid-2017, dos Santos twice traveled to Barcelona, Spain, on weeks-long visits that were rumored to be related to a medical problem. The government acknowledged that the first visit was related to his health. No official explanation was given for his second visit, from 3 to 19 July.
Dos Santos had cancer for several years prior to his death .
He was in critical condition after suffering cardiorespiratory arrest on 23 June 2022 and also tested positive for COVID-19. He died on 8 July 2022, at Teknon Medical Centre in Barcelona, at the age of 79.

He was held a state funeral in the Angolan capital Luanda with several African leaders and Portugal&#x27;s president present on 28 August 2022.

==Awards and recognitions==

** Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry

Dos Santos was praised for the major role he played in favour of the country&#x27;s independence and his commitment to the promotion of peace and democracy in the country, through negotiations with opposition movements designed to put a definite end to the civil war. He received the Order of the Companions of O. R. Tambo in 2010. He also received an honorary diploma of the National Commission on Racial Justice of the Unified Church of Christ (USA).

Dos Santos was named &quot;Man of the Year 2014&quot; by &quot;Africa World&quot;. According to the newspaper, the choice of the Angolan leader was due to his contribution to the great process of economic and democratic recovery of Angola since the end of the war.

A University of Namibia Engineering and Information Technology campus in Ongwediva is named after dos Santos, who was himself an engineer by profession, for assisting Namibia with attaining her freedom from oppression.
Portugal awarded dos Santos the Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry in 1988 and the Grand Collar of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword in 1996.

<doc id="392288" wikidata="Q1422014" url="?curid=392288" title="Sharpeville">
<text>Sharpeville (also spelled Sharpville) is a township situated between two large industrial cities, Vanderbijlpark and Vereeniging, in southern Gauteng, South Africa. Sharpeville is one of the oldest of six townships in the Vaal Triangle. It was named after John Lillie Sharpe who came to South Africa from Glasgow, Scotland, as secretary of Stewarts &amp; Lloyds. Sharpe was elected to the Vereeniging City Council in 1932 and held the position of mayor from 1934 to 1937.

The main reason for the establishment of Sharpeville was the relocation of people from &quot;Top Location&quot; to an area away from Vereeniging because it was felt black people were too close to Vereeniging for comfort. Because the project was intended only to relocate residents of &quot;Top Location&quot;, and not to house additional people, it did not alleviate the housing shortage. What was planned as a five-year resettlement project beginning in 1935, in fact, took 20 years. In 1941, 16,000 people lived in &quot;Top Location&quot;. The building of the houses only started in 1942. A sub-economic housing scheme was used for Sharpeville. Water was free but 14 houses shared one tap and there were two bathing complexes in the township. By 1946 some of the houses had their own taps and bathrooms. The township was first called &quot;Sharpe Native Township&quot; but it changed to Sharpeville in the 1950s.

==Place in South African history==
With the implementation of the apartheid government&#x27;s Group Areas Act 21 of 1950, it was estimated that over 3.5 million South Africans were forcibly removed from 1960 to 1982. Of the &quot;Top Location&quot; residents, Blacks were moved to Sharpeville, Coloureds to Rus-ter-vaal and Indians to Roshnee. The Indians were the last ethnic group to leave &quot;Top Location&quot;, the last residents being moved to Roshnee in 1974. In 2004, the people of Top Location were compensated for the loss of their properties and land, and an amount of R60,000 per house was paid to all former residents or dependants.

On 21 March 1960, the Sharpeville massacre occurred when the PAC (Pan Africanist Congress) organized a protest in which black Africans attempted to hand in to police their Apartheid-required pass books which restricted them from going in certain areas. Although the crowd was peaceful throughout the day, over 70 white officers and men of the South African Police (SAP), 13 of them armed with sub machine guns, fired at point blank range (a distance of three to five meters at most )according to police testimony). They had been ordered to fire by the Officer in Charge. According to official figures released at the time by Prime Minister Henrik Verwoerd&#x27;s government, 69 Africans were killed and 180 wounded by the police. All of these people were long term residents of Sharpeville. None were &quot;migrant workers.&quot;

A new book published in 2024 and based on extensive research in police documents held by the South African National Archives in Pretoria has now demonstrated that the &quot;69 killed and 180 injured&quot; was a severe undercount and was in fact a police lie. Using these police documents that were initially created in 1960, 1961, and 1962, the two authors now show that the number of killed on 21 March 1960 was at least 91 and probably more, and that the number injured, many of them crippled for life, was at least 238. These same records also contain at least 250 witness statements collected from Sharpville residents in 1961 and 1962, all of them given under oath and attested to by the police at the time. The names and ages of all the victims are recorded in this new book by Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger.

Sharpeville was also the site of a murder in 1984 which led to the arrest, trial, and controversial death sentences (later commuted) of the Sharpeville Six.

Symbolically, Nelson Mandela signed the South African Constitution in Sharpeville on 10 December 1996. He also opened &quot;The Sharpeville Memorial&quot; to honour the victims of the Sharpeville massacre of 1960. 21 March is now celebrated as Human Rights Day.

<text>Antoine François Prévost d&#x27;Exiles ( , , ; 1 April 169725 November 1763), usually known simply as the Abbé Prévost, was a French priest, author, and novelist.

== Life and works ==
He was born at Hesdin, Artois, and first appears with the full name of Prévost d&#x27;Exiles, in a letter to the booksellers of Amsterdam in 1731. His father, Lievin Prévost, was a lawyer, and several members of the family had embraced the ecclesiastical estate. His happy childhood ended abruptly, when he lost his mother and his younger favorite sister at the age of 14. Prévost was educated at the Jesuit school of Hesdin, and in 1713 became a novice of the order in Paris, pursuing his studies at the same time at the college in La Flèche.

At the end of 1716 he left the Jesuits to join the army, but soon tired of military life, and returned to Paris in 1719, apparently with the idea of resuming his novitiate. He is said to have travelled in the Netherlands about this time; in any case he returned to the army, this time with a commission. Some biographers have assumed that he suffered some of the misfortunes assigned to his hero Des Grieux. Whatever the truth, he joined the learned community of the Benedictines of St Maur, with whom he found refuge, he himself says, after the unlucky termination of a love affair. He took his vows at Jumièges in 1721 after a year&#x27;s novitiate, and in 1726 took priest&#x27;s orders at St Germer de Flaix. He spent seven years in various houses of the order, teaching, preaching and studying. In 1728 he was sent to the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Paris, where he contributed to the &quot;Gallia Christiana&quot;, a work of historiographic documentation undertaken communally by the monks in continuation of the works of , who had been a member of their order. His restless spirit made him seek from the Pope a transfer to the easier rule of Cluny; but he left the abbey without leave (1728), and, learning that his superiors had obtained a &quot;lettre de cachet&quot; against him, fled to England.

In London he acquired a wide knowledge of English history and literature, as can be seen in his writings. Before leaving the Benedictines Prévost had begun perhaps his most famous novel, &quot;Mémoires et aventures d&#x27;un homme de qualité qui s&#x27;est retiré du monde&quot;, the first four volumes of which were published in Paris in 1728, and two years later at Amsterdam. In 1729 he left England for the Netherlands, where he began to publish (Utrecht, 1731) a novel, the material of which, at least, had been gathered in London, &quot;Le Philosophe anglais, ou Histoire de Monsieur Cleveland, fils naturel de Cromwell, écrite par lui-même, et traduite de l&#x27;anglais par l&#x27;auteur des Mémoires d&#x27;un homme de qualité&quot; (1731–1739, 8 vols., Amsterdam and Paris). A spurious fifth volume (Utrecht, 1734) contained attacks on the Jesuits; an English translation the same year ends with this volume.

Meanwhile, during his residence at the Hague, he engaged on a translation of De Thou&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot;, and, relying on the popularity of his first book, published at Amsterdam a &quot;Suite&quot; in three volumes, forming volumes v, vi, and vii of the original &quot;Mémoires et aventures d&#x27;un homme de qualité&quot;. The seventh volume contained the famous &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, separately published in Paris in 1731 as &quot;Histoire du Chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut&quot;. The book was eagerly read, chiefly in pirated copies, being forbidden in France. In 1733 he left the Hague for London in company of a lady whose character, according to Prévost&#x27;s enemies, was doubtful. In London he edited a weekly gazette on the model of Joseph Addison&#x27;s &quot;Spectator&quot;, &quot;Le Pour et contre&quot;, which he continued to produce in collaboration with the playwright Charles-Hugues Le Febvre de Saint-Marc, with short intervals, until 1740.

In the autumn of 1734 Prévost was reconciled with the Benedictines, and, returning to France, was received in the Benedictine monastery of La Croix-Saint-Leufroy in the diocese of Évreux to pass through a new, though brief, novitiate. In 1735 he was dispensed from residence in a monastery by becoming almoner to the Prince de Conti, and in 1754 obtained the . He continued to produce novels and translations from the English, and, with the exception of a brief exile (1741–1742) spent in Brussels and Frankfurt, he resided for the most part at Chantilly until his death, which took place suddenly while he was walking in the neighbouring woods. The cause of his death, the rupture of an aneurysm, is all that is definitely known. Stories of crime and disaster were related of Prévost by his enemies, and diligently repeated, but appear to be apocryphal.

<text>Pietro Ziani (died 13 March 1230) was the Doge of Venice from 15 August 1205 to 1229, succeeding Enrico Dandolo. He was the son of Doge Sebastian Ziani of the very rich noble family. He was married to Maria Baseggio and Constance of Sicily.

In his youth a sailor, he commanded a flotilla escorting the emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1177, took also part in the Fourth Crusade and sacking of Constantinople. After his election, Ziani is said to consider the transfer of the capital of the Republic to Constantinople, but eventually the Council decided against it. Instead, he organized the Venetian acquisitions in the territory of the Latin Empire: Crete, Corfu, other islands and the substantial part of Constantinople itself, demanding an oath from the Venetian colony in the city. Ziani established also commercial ties with the post-Byzantine states, signing in 1210 a treaty with the despotate of Epirus under Michael I Komnenos Doukas.

According to the &quot;Cronaca Altinate&quot;, he strove to maintain peace with Padua after an incident at a festival in Treviso so that Venice could concentrate on its new Greek territories. He was forced to fend off a Paduan invasion in the War of the Castle of Love (1215).

Ziani abdicated in February 1229. He was succeeded by his brother-in-law, Jacopo Tiepolo, but Ziani refused to meet him and died a year later. He is buried in the church of San Giorgio Maggiore.

<text>Old Town Hall (, ) is a complex of buildings from the 14th century in the Old Town of Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. It is the oldest city hall in the country and it is one of the oldest stone buildings still standing in Bratislava, with the tower being built approximately in 1370. The town hall was created in the 15th century by connecting three townhouses, and then went through several reconstructions in the course of the centuries.

It houses the oldest museum in Bratislava, the Bratislava City Museum, founded in 1868, featuring an exhibit of the city history and an exhibit of torture devices. The outlook from the top of the Old Town Hall tower offers a round view of Bratislava Old Town and its environs.

== Location ==
The Old Town Hall is located in the heart of the Bratislava, between the Main Square and the Primate&#x27;s square at: . It is next to the Jesuit Church and near the Greek and Japanese embassies. It is easily recognizable by its colorful tiled roof.

== History ==
Finished in the Gothic style in the 15th century, it resulted from the joining several buildings: Jacobus&#x27; house with a tower, Pawer&#x27;s house, Unger&#x27;s house and the Apponyi palace (, ). The principal building adjacent to the tower and facing the Main Square was built by the town Mayor Jacobus II (also called &quot;Jakab&quot;, &quot;Jakub&quot;) in the 14th century, while the tower (originally Gothic) was erected in the late 13th century. Towers made of stone were part of some medieval townhouses in order to provide safety in case of war or protection of wealth in case of fire. Although exact date cannot be specified, details of the gothic windows suggest it was built approximately in 1370. The tower&#x27;s ground floor was one meter lower than today&#x27;s street level. The tower was reinforced and modified several times over the next centuries; at one point it contained mechanical clock, a large sphere depicting the current phases of the moon and above that there were bells.

The Apponyi Palace was built by Count György Apponyi, a Hungarian nobleman and King&#x27;s advisor, in place of two older townhouses in 1761–1762. The architect is unknown but older literature attributes the project to F. A. Hildebrandt. Only two wings survive from this residential representative town residence - western and the short southern. The ground floor was both residential and used for storage. The staircase included baroque stone sculptures of saints until the 1930s. First floor is the representative piano nobile with preserved rococo-classical interior decorations. Second floor was used for the accommodation of the Apponyi family, ceilings are lower here and wall decorations are less elaborate. The attic was used for accommodation from the 18th century until the first half of the 19th century (it was common for visitors to coronations and other major events to sleep in the attics of townhouses and palaces of the noble), today, the wooden booths for sleeping were removed. Until the second half of the 19th century the palace used to have another two wings around a trapezoid-shaped courtyard, used by the servants.

Later, the Old Town Hall underwent many transformations and enhancements, namely a Renaissance style reconstruction in 1599 following earthquake damage, Baroque restyling to the tower after a fire in the 18th century, and the addition of a Neo-Renaissance/Neo-Gothic wing built in 1912.

=== Use ===
The building was used as a town hall from the 15th century through the late 19th century. At times during that period, however, it also served other purposes, including housing a prison and mint, and being place of trade and celebrations. It was also used as the city&#x27;s arsenal depository and municipal archive.

Today it hosts the Bratislava City Museum, displaying exhibitions of Pressburg&#x27;s history. Exhibited items include torture instruments, the old town dungeons, antique weapons and armour, paintings and miniatures. One of its curiosities is a cannonball embedded in the tower wall, shot by Napoleon&#x27;s soldiers in 1809 during bombardment of the city from Petržalka. During the summer its courtyard hosts concerts. The attic of the Apponyi Palace is used as a Study Depository of Glass and Ceramics.

The top of the tower is accessible as part of the Bratislava City Museum exhibition. 

It offers a view of the Old Town of the city.

== Current state ==
Despite some reconstruction efforts, the structure is in need of renovating some outside parts.

<text>Thomas Lowndes (1692 – 12 May 1748) was the founder of the Lowndean professorship of astronomy at Cambridge University, England.

Both his father and mother were Cheshire landowners. In 1725 he was appointed provost marshal of South Carolina, a post he preferred to hold by deputy. In 1727 Lowndes claimed to have taken a prominent part in inducing the British government to purchase Carolina, but he surrendered his patent when the transfer of the colony to the crown was completed. His patent was renewed in 1730, but he resigned it in 1733.

He then brought various impractical schemes before the government to check the illicit trade in wool between Ireland and France; to regulate the paper currency of New England; and to supply the navy with salt from brine, etc. By his will he left his inherited Cheshire properties to the University of Cambridge for the foundation of a chair of astronomy and geometry.

<doc id="392298" wikidata="Q1862250" url="?curid=392298" title="List of Christmas carols">
<text>This list of Christmas carols is organized by language of origin. Originally, a &quot;Christmas carol&quot; referred to a piece of vocal music in carol form whose lyrics centre on the theme of Christmas or the Christmas season. The difference between a Christmas carol and a Christmas popular song can often be unclear as they are both sung by groups of people going house to house during the Christmas season. Some view Christmas carols to be only religious in nature and consider Christmas songs to be secular.

Many traditional Christmas carols focus on the Christian celebration of the birth of Jesus, while others celebrate the Twelve Days of Christmas that range from 25 December to 5 January or Christmastide which ranges from 24 December to 5 January. As a result, many Christmas Carols can be related to St Stephen&#x27;s Day (26 December), St John&#x27;s Day (27 December), Feast of Holy Innocents (28 December), St Sylvester&#x27;s Day (31 December), and the Epiphany. Examples of this are &quot;We Three Kings&quot; (an Epiphany song), and &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; (a carol for St. Stephen&#x27;s Day). Nonetheless, some other categories of Christmas music, both religious and secular, have become associated with the Christmas season even though the lyrics may not specifically refer to Christmas – for example, &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; (no religious references) and &quot;O Come, O Come, Emmanuel&quot; (an Advent chant). Other Christmas music sung by carolers focuses on more secular Christmas themes, and winter carols and novelty Christmas songs often refer to winter scenes, family gatherings, and Santa Claus (&quot;Jingle Bells&quot;, &quot;O Christmas Tree&quot;, &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot;, &quot;Jolly Old Saint Nicholas&quot;, &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;, &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;, etc.).

==Afrikaans==
==Arabic==

==Cebuano==
==Chinese==
The English titles are taken from the &quot;Hymns of Universal Praise&quot; and the &quot;Chinese New Hymnal&quot;.

== Croatian ==
==Czech==
== Danish ==

The list is based primarily on carols and hymns mentioned in the Song Book for the Danish Folk High School.

Where possible, a carol title is linked to its (Danish) Wikipedia entry, where the carol can be heard. Otherwise, a carol title has been linked to its entry at the Danish Hymn Book Online.

Carolling, i.e. dancing around, is practised - probably unintentionally - in Danish Christmas tradition, when a Christmas party join hands forming a chain around the family Christmas tree and walk, dance or run around the Christmas tree depending on the Christmas carol or song sung.

<doc id="392300" wikidata="Q57352" url="?curid=392300" title="Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa">
<text>Hamad bin Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa ( &quot;&quot;; born 28 January 1950) has been the King of Bahrain since 14 February 2002, after ruling as Emir of Bahrain from 6 March 1999. He is the son of Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the previous and first emir. The country has been ruled by the Al Khalifa dynasty since 1783.

== Early life and education ==
Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa was born on 28 January 1950 in Riffa, Bahrain. His parents were Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, then Crown Prince, and Hessa bint Salman Al Khalifa.

After attending Manama secondary school in Bahrain, Hamad was sent to England to attend Applegarth College in Godalming, Surrey before taking a place at The Leys School in Cambridge. Hamad then underwent military training, first with the British Army at Mons Officer Cadet School at Aldershot in Hampshire, graduating in September 1968. Four years later, in June 1972, Hamad attended the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, graduating the following June with a degree in leadership.

== Crown prince ==

Hamad bin Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa was designated as heir apparent by his father on 27 June 1964. In 1968, he was appointed as the chairman of the irrigation council and Manama municipal council. He was commissioned into the Bahrain National Guard on 16 February 1968 and appointed as its commander the same year, remaining in that post until 1969 when he was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Bahrain Defence Force. In 1970, Hamad became the head of the Bahraini department of defence and the vice-chairman of the administrative council, remaining in both offices until 1971. From 1971 to 1988 he was the minister of state for defence.

In October 1977, Sheikh Hamad started learning to fly helicopters, successfully completing the training in January 1978.

He then worked to establish the Bahrain Amiri Air Force, which came into being at the height of the Tanker War in 1987 when the defence force air wing was reconstituted as an air force.

== Reign ==

On the death of his father Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, Hamad became Emir of Bahrain on 6 March 1999. As Emir, Hamad brought several political reforms to Bahrain. These included the release of all political prisoners, the dissolution of the State Security Court and the abolition of the 1974 Decree on State Security Measures. Additionally, many Bahraini citizens were permitted to return after several years in exile overseas. In 2002, he declared himself king. He enjoys wide executive authorities which include appointing the prime minister and his ministers, commanding the army, chairing the Higher Judicial Council, appointing the parliament&#x27;s upper half and dissolving its elected lower half.

=== Political turmoil ===
After Hamad took power in 1999, he focused on attaining stability in a nation riddled with profound tensions after the 1990s uprising. The King succeeded in improving the living standards and in making Bahrain a financial hub. During the period 2003–2010 the Shi&#x27;ite community accused his government of corruption, discrimination in housing and jobs, recruiting foreigners to the military services and bringing Sunni tribes from Asia to change the demographic composition of the nation.

Although King Hamad&#x27;s reign has seen the admittance of Shi&#x27;ites into positions in the government, there have still been calls for a more equitable distribution of positions and jobs. The Al Khalifa family lead a large number of ministerial and governmental posts including the Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Bahrain Economic Development Board and the Supreme Council for Women. The vast majority of significant positions in the Bahrain Defence Force are held by Sunnis.

=== 2011 Bahraini uprising ===

On 14 February 2011, the tenth anniversary of a referendum in favour of the National Action Charter, and ninth anniversary of the writing of the Constitution of 2002, Bahrain was rocked by protests inspired by the Arab Spring and co-ordinated by a Facebook page named &quot;Day of Rage in Bahrain&quot;, a page that was liked by tens of thousands just one week after its creation. The Bahrain government responded with what has been described as a &quot;brutal&quot; crackdown on the protests, including violations of human rights that caused anger. Later on, demonstrators demanded that Hamad step down. As a result of this &quot;massive&quot; crackdown, &quot;Foreign Policy Magazine&quot; classified him as ranking 3rd out of 8 of &quot;America&#x27;s Unsavory Allies&quot; calling him &quot;one of the bad guys the U.S. still supports&quot;.

On 11 February 2011, King Hamad ordered that 1,000 Bahraini Dinars (approximately US$2,667) be given to &quot;each family&quot; to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the National Action Charter referendum. Agence France-Presse linked the BD1,000 payments to 14 February 2011 demonstration plans.

On 15 February 2011, Hamad apologized for the deaths of two demonstrators in a rare TV speech and urged an investigation into the incident. Two days later, four protesters were killed and hundreds wounded when protesters were attacked in Pearl Roundabout at 03:00 am local time. The Pearl Roundabout was evacuated and encircled by the Bahraini army. Two days later, Prince Salman, Hamad&#x27;s son, ordered the withdrawal of army troops from there after the death of another protester caused by live ammunition next to Pearl roundabout.

During the peak of the Bahraini uprising in mid March 2011, Hamad declared a State of National Safety for three months just after Salman summoned Peninsula Shield Force troops to enter Bahrain. Saudi Arabia deployed about 1,000 troops with armoured support, and the United Arab Emirates deployed about 500 troops. Opposition parties reacted strongly, calling it an &quot;occupation&quot;. Hamad, however, claimed that he deployed the troops to &quot;protect infrastructure and to secure key installations&quot;.

In June 2011, Hamad commissioned the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, headed by respected human rights lawyer M. Cherif Bassiouni, to look into the events surrounding the unrest. The establishment of the BICI was praised by Barack Obama and the international community as a step towards establishing responsibility and accountability for the events of the 2011–2012 Bahraini uprising. The BICI reported its findings in November 2011 and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &quot;commend[ed] King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa&#x27;s initiative in commissioning it&quot;. In August 2012, Amnesty International stated that &quot;the government&#x27;s response has only scratched the surface of these issues. Reforms have been piecemeal, perhaps aiming to appease Bahrain&#x27;s international partners, and have failed to provide real accountability and justice for the victims&quot;.

=== Foreign relations ===

The king was invited by the British court to the wedding of Prince William, but declined amidst protests by human rights activists, who had pledged to disrupt his stay in Britain because of his violent response to demonstrators.
In August 2020, King Hamad explained to visiting U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that Bahrain is committed to the creation of a Palestinian state, implicitly rejecting the normalization of ties with Israel. However, on 11 September 2020, it was announced that Bahrain and Israel had agreed to establish full diplomatic relations. On 15 September 2020, Bahrain officially opened state to state relations with Israel, signing diplomatic agreements at a public ceremony at the White House in Washington, D.C. On 2 November 2023, Bahrain recalled its ambassador to Israel, seemingly in response to the Israel–Hamas war.

On 19 September 2022, he attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey, London.

== Personal life ==
Hamad has four wives and has had in total twelve children: seven sons and five daughters.

* He married his first wife (also his first cousin), Sheikha Sabika bint Ibrahim Al Khalifa, at Rifa&#x27;a on 9 October 1968. She is Bahraini and together they have three sons and one daughter:

<text>Mathieu Kérékou (; 2 September 1933 – 14 October 2015) was a Beninese politician who served as president of the People&#x27;s Republic of Benin from 1972 to 1991 and the Republic of Benin from 1996 to 2006.

After seizing power in a military coup, he ruled the country for 18 years under an officially Marxist–Leninist ideology, before he was stripped of his powers by the National Conference of 1990. He was defeated in the 1991 presidential election but was returned to the presidency in the 1996 election and controversially re-elected in 2001.

==Military background==
Kérékou was born in 1933 in Kouarfa village, in north-west French Dahomey. After having studied at military schools in modern-day Mali and Senegal, Kérékou served in the military by joining the French Army in 1960. Following independence, from 1961 to 1963 he was an &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Dahomeyan President Hubert Maga. Following Maurice Kouandété&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état in December 1967, Kérékou, who was his cousin, was made chairman of the Military Revolutionary Council. After Kérékou attended French military schools from 1968 to 1970, Maga made him a major, deputy chief of staff, and commander of the Ouidah paratroop unit.

==1972 coup and Marxist rule==

Kérékou seized power in Dahomey in a military coup on 26 October 1972, ending a system of government in which three members of a presidential council were to rotate power (earlier in the year Maga had handed over power to Justin Ahomadegbé).

During his first two years in power, Kérékou expressed only nationalism and said that the country&#x27;s revolution would not &quot;burden itself by copying foreign ideology ... We do not want communism or capitalism or socialism. We have our own Dahomean social and cultural system.&quot; On 30 November 1974, however, he announced the adoption of Marxism-Leninism by the state. The country was renamed from the Republic of Dahomey to the People&#x27;s Republic of Benin a year later; the banks and petroleum industry were nationalized. The People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party of Benin (&quot;Parti de la révolution populaire du Bénin&quot;, PRPB) was established as the sole ruling party. In 1980, Kérékou was elected president by the Revolutionary National Assembly; he retired from the army in 1987.

It has been suggested that Kérékou&#x27;s move to Marxism-Leninism was motivated mainly by pragmatic considerations, and that Kérékou himself was not actually a leftist radical; the new ideology offered a means of legitimization, a way of distinguishing the new regime from those that had preceded it, and was based on broader unifying principles than the politics of ethnicity. Kérékou&#x27;s regime initially included officers from both the north and south of the country, but as the years passed, the northerners (like Kérékou himself) became clearly dominant, undermining the idea that the regime was not based on ethnicity. By officially adopting Marxism-Leninism, Kérékou may also have wanted to win the support of the country&#x27;s leftists.
Kérékou&#x27;s regime was rigid and vigorous in pursuing its newly adopted ideological goals from the mid-1970s to the late 1970s. In 1974, under the influence of young revolutionaries - the &quot;Ligueurs&quot; - the government embarked on a socialist program: nationalization of strategic sectors of the economy, reform of the education system, establishment of agricultural cooperatives and new local government structures, and a campaign to eradicate &quot;feudal forces&quot; including tribalism. Beginning in the late 1970s, the regime jettisoned much of its radicalism and settled onto a more moderately socialist course as Kérékou consolidated his personal control.Its relations with France and other African governments in the region deteriorated because of the Marxism claimed by the Beninese regime and the support offered to the Polisario Front for the liberation of Western Sahara. The French government of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing feared the spread of Marxism in West Africa and decided to react. He was joined by Félix Houphouet-Boigny (Ivory Coast), Gnassingbé Eyadéma (Togo), Joseph-Désiré Mobutu (Zaire) and Hassan II (Morocco), who, in addition to the diplomatic isolation and attempts to destabilize Benin economically, decided to organize an attempted coup d&#x27;état. This was Operation Shrimp, entrusted to the French mercenary Bob Denard, on 17 January 1977, but it failed completely.

It was hoped that the nationalizations of the 1970s would help develop the economy, but it remained in a very poor condition. Kérékou began reversing course in the early 1980s, closing down numerous state-run companies and attempting to attract foreign investment. He also accepted an IMF structural readjustment program in 1989, agreeing to austerity measures that severely cut state expenditure. The economic situation continued to worsen during the 1980s, provoking widespread unrest in 1989. A student strike began in January of that year; subsequently, strikes among various elements of society increased in frequency, and the nature of their demands grew broader: whereas initially they had focused on economic issues such as salary arrears, this progressed to include demands for political reform.

==Transition to multi-party==

In the period of reforms towards multiparty democracy in Africa at the beginning of the 1990s, Benin moved onto this path early, with Kérékou being forced to make concessions to popular discontent. Benin&#x27;s early and relatively smooth transition may be attributed to the particularly dismal economic situation in the country, which seemed to preclude any alternative. Amid increasing unrest, Kérékou was re-elected as president by the National Assembly in August 1989, but in December 1989 Marxism-Leninism was dropped as the state ideology, and a national conference was held in February 1990. The conference turned out to be hostile to Kérékou and declared its own sovereignty; despite the objections of some of his officers to this turn of events, Kérékou did not act against the conference, although he labelled the conference&#x27;s declaration of sovereignty a &quot;civilian coup&quot;. During the transition that followed, Kérékou remained president but lost most of his power.

During the 1990 National Conference, which was nationally televised, Kérékou spoke to the Archbishop of Cotonou, Isidore de Souza, confessing guilt and begging forgiveness for the flaws of his regime. An observer described it as a &quot;remarkable piece of political theater&quot;, full of cultural symbolism and significance; in effect, Kérékou was seeking forgiveness from his people. Such a gesture, so unusual for the African leaders of the time, could have fatally weakened Kérékou&#x27;s political standing, but he performed the gesture in such a way that, far from ending his political career, it instead served to symbolically redeem him and facilitate his political rehabilitation, while also &quot;securing him immunity from prosecution&quot;. Kérékou shrewdly utilized the timing and setting: &quot;Culturally as well as theologically it was impossible to refuse forgiveness on these terms.&quot;

World Bank economist Nicéphore Soglo, chosen as prime minister by the conference, took office in March, and a new constitution was approved in a December 1990 referendum. Multi-party elections were held in March 1991, which Kérékou lost, obtaining only about 32% of the vote in the second round against Prime Minister Soglo; while he won very large vote percentages in the north, in the rest of the country he found little support. Kérékou was thus the first mainland African president to lose power through a popular election. He apologized for &quot;deplorable and regrettable incidents&quot; that occurred during his rule.

After losing the election in March 1991, Kérékou left the political scene and &quot;withdrew to total silence&quot;, another move that was interpreted as penitential.

==1996 presidential election==
Kérékou reclaimed the presidency in the March 1996 election. Soglo&#x27;s economic reforms and his alleged dictatorial tendencies had caused his popularity to suffer. Although Kérékou received fewer votes than Soglo in the first round, he then defeated Soglo in the second round, taking 52.5% of the vote. Kérékou was backed in the second round by third place candidate Adrien Houngbédji and fourth place candidate Bruno Amoussou; as in 1991, Kérékou received very strong support from northern voters, but he also improved his performance in the south. Soglo alleged fraud, but this was rejected by the Constitutional Court, which confirmed Kérékou&#x27;s victory. When taking the oath of office, Kérékou left out a portion that referred to the &quot;spirits of the ancestors&quot; because he had become a born-again Christian after his defeat by Soglo. He was subsequently forced to retake the oath including the reference to spirits.

==Disputed re-election, 2001==

Kérékou was re-elected for a second five-year term in the March 2001 presidential election under controversial circumstances. In the first round he took 45.4% of the vote; Soglo, who took second place, and parliament speaker Houngbédji, who took third, both refused to participate in the second round, alleging fraud and saying that they did not want to legitimize the vote by participating in it. This left the fourth-place finisher, Amoussou, to face Kérékou in the run-off, and Kérékou easily won with 83.6% of the vote. It was subsequently discovered that the American corporation Titan gave more than two million dollars to Kérékou&#x27;s re-election campaign as a bribe.

During Kérékou&#x27;s second period in office his government followed a liberal economic path. The period also saw Benin take part in international peacekeeping missions in other African states.

Kérékou was barred from running again in 2006 on two counts. The constitution not only stipulated an absolute two-term limit, but also required that presidential candidates be younger than 70; he turned 70 in 2003, during his second term. Kérékou said in July 2005 that he would not attempt to amend the constitution to allow him to run for a third term. &quot;If you don&#x27;t leave power,&quot; he said, &quot;power will leave you.&quot; There was, however, speculation that he had wanted it to be changed, but faced too much opposition.

On 5 March 2006, voters went to the polls to decide who would succeed Kérékou as President of Benin. Yayi Boni defeated Adrien Houngbédji in a run-off vote on 19 March, and Kérékou left office at the end of his term, at midnight on 6 April 2006.

==Religion and symbolism==

Born and baptized in the Roman Catholic faith, although he was a lapsed adherent, Kérékou allegedly converted to Islam in 1980 while on a visit to Libya, and changed his first name to Ahmed, but he later returned to the use of the name Mathieu. This alleged conversion may have been designed to please the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and obtain financial and military support. Alternatively, the conversion story may have been a rumor planted by some of his opponents in order to destabilize his regime. He subsequently became a born-again Christian. Some Vodun believers in Benin regarded him as having magical powers, explaining his ability to survive repeated coup attempts during his military rule.

Nicknamed &quot;the chameleon&quot; from an early point in his career, Kérékou&#x27;s motto was &quot;the branch will not break in the arms of the chameleon&quot;. The nickname and motto he adopted were full of cultural symbolism, articulating and projecting his power and ability. Unlike some past rulers who had adopted animal symbolism intending to project a violent, warlike sense of power, Kérékou&#x27;s symbolic animal suggested skill and cleverness; his motto suggested that he would keep the branch from breaking, but implicitly warned of what could happen to &quot;the branch&quot; if it was not &quot;in the arms of the chameleon&quot;—political chaos. To some, his nickname seemed particularly apt as he successfully adapted himself to a new political climate and neoliberal economic policies in the 1990s.

He used the campaign slogan, &quot;Experience in the service of youth.&quot;

==Retirement and death==
After leaving office in 2006, Kérékou stayed out of politics and spent time at his homes in Cotonou and Natitingou in northwestern Benin, his native region. He suffered a health crisis in 2014 and was taken to Paris for treatment. Although he recovered, he continued to suffer health problems, and he died in Benin on 14 October 2015 at the age of 82. His death was announced in a statement by President Thomas Boni Yayi. No cause of death was stated. A week of national mourning was declared.

<text>The Mapuche ( , ) also known as Araucanians are a group of indigenous inhabitants of south-central Chile and southwestern Argentina, including parts of Patagonia. The collective term refers to a wide-ranging ethnicity composed of various groups who share a common social, religious, and economic structure, as well as a common linguistic heritage as Mapudungun speakers. Their homelands once extended from Choapa Valley to the Chiloé Archipelago and later spread eastward to Puelmapu, a land comprising part of the Argentine pampa and Patagonia. Today the collective group makes up over 80% of the indigenous peoples in Chile and about 9% of the total Chilean population. The Mapuche are concentrated in the Araucanía region. Many have migrated from rural areas to the cities of Santiago and Buenos Aires for economic opportunities, more than 92% of the Mapuches are from Chile.

The Mapuche traditional economy is based on agriculture; their traditional social organization consists of extended families, under the direction of a &quot;lonko&quot; or chief. In times of war, the Mapuche would unite in larger groupings and elect a &quot;toki&quot; (meaning &quot;axe&quot; or &quot;axe-bearer&quot;) to lead them. Mapuche material culture is known for its textiles and silverwork.

At the time of Spanish arrival, the Picunche inhabited the valleys between the Choapa and Itata, Araucanian Mapuche inhabited the valleys between the Itata and Toltén rivers, south of there, the Huilliche and the Cunco lived as far south as the Chiloé Archipelago. In the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, Mapuche groups migrated eastward into the Andes and Pampas, conquering, fusing and establishing relationships with the Poya and Pehuenche. At about the same time, ethnic groups of the Pampa regions, the Puelche, Ranquel, and northern Aonikenk, made contact with Mapuche groups. The Tehuelche adopted the Mapuche language and some of their culture, in what came to be called Araucanization, during which Patagonia came under effective Mapuche suzerainty.

Mapuche in the Spanish-ruled areas, especially the Picunche, mingled with the Spanish during the colonial period, forming a mestizo population that lost its indigenous identity. But Mapuche society in Araucanía and Patagonia remained independent until the late nineteenth century, when Chile occupied Araucanía and Argentina conquered Puelmapu. Since then the Mapuche have become subjects, and later nationals and citizens of the respective states. Today, many Mapuche and Chilean communities are engaged in the so-called Mapuche conflict over land and indigenous rights in both Argentina and Chile.

==Etymology==

Historically, the Spanish colonizers of South America referred to the Mapuche people as Araucanians ( ; ). This term is now considered pejorative by some people. For others, the importance of the term Araucanian lies in the universality of the epic work , written by Alonso de Ercilla, and the feats of that people in their long and interminable war against the Spanish Empire. The name is probably derived from the placename (Spanish Arauco), meaning &quot;chalky/clayish water&quot;. The Quechua word , meaning &quot;rebel, enemy&quot;, is probably not the root of &quot;araucano&quot;.

Scholars believe that the various Mapuche groups (Moluche, Williche, Pikunche, etc.) called themselves during the early Spanish colonial period, due to what they referred to as their pure native blood, derived from meaning &quot;pure&quot; and meaning &quot;people&quot;.

The name &quot;Mapuche&quot; is used both to refer collectively to the Pikunche, Williche, and Moluche or Nguluche from Araucanía, at other times, exclusively to the Moluche or Nguluche from Araucanía. However, Mapuche is a relatively recent endonym meaning &quot;People of the Earth&quot; or &quot;Children of the Land&quot;, with meaning &quot;earth&quot; or &quot;land&quot;, and meaning &quot;person&quot;. It is preferred as a term when referring to the people after the Arauco War.

The Mapuche identify by the geography of their territories, such as:
* Pwelche (also Hispanicized as Puelche): &quot;people of the east&quot; occupied &quot;Pwel mapu&quot; or , the eastern lands (Pampa and Patagonia of Argentina).
* Pikunche (also Hispanicized as Picunche): &quot;people of the north&quot; occupied , the &quot;northern lands&quot;.
* Williche (also Hispanicized as Huilliche): &quot;people of the south&quot; occupied , the &quot;southern lands&quot;.
* Pewenche (also Hispanicized as Pehuenche): &quot;people of the pewen (&quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;)&quot; occupied , &quot;the land of the pewen&quot;.
* Lafkenche: &quot;people of the sea&quot; occupied , &quot;the land of the sea&quot;; also known as &quot;Coastal Mapuche&quot;.
* Nagche: &quot;people of the plains&quot; occupied , &quot;the land of the plains&quot; (located in sectors of the Cordillera de Nahuelbuta and the low zones bordering it). Its epic and literary name is Araucanians and its old autochthonous name is Reche. The ancient Mapuche Toqui (&quot;axe-bearer&quot;) like Lef-Traru (&quot;swift hawk&quot;, better known as Lautaro), Kallfülikan (&quot;blue quartz stone&quot;, better known as Caupolicán – &quot;polished flint&quot;) or Pelontraru (&quot;Shining Caracara&quot;, better known as Pelantaro) were Nagche.
* Wenteche: &quot;people of the valleys&quot; occupied , &quot;the land of the valleys&quot;.

== History ==

=== Pre-Columbian period ===

Archaeological finds have shown that Mapuche culture existed in Chile and Argentina as early as 600 to 500 BC. Genetically the Mapuche differ from the adjacent indigenous peoples of Patagonia. This suggests a &quot;different origin or long-lasting separation of Mapuche and Patagonian populations&quot;.

Troops of the Inca Empire are reported to have reached the Maule River and had a battle with the Mapuche between the Maule and the Itata Rivers there. The southern border of the Inca Empire is believed by most modern scholars to have been situated between Santiago and the Maipo River, or somewhere between Santiago and the Maule River. Thus the bulk of the Mapuche escaped Inca rule. Through their contact with Incan invaders Mapuches would have for the first time met people with state organizations. Their contact with the Incas gave them a collective awareness distinguishing between them and the invaders and uniting them into loose geo-political units despite their lack of state organization.

At the time of the arrival of the first Spaniards to Chile, the largest indigenous population concentration was in the area spanning from the Itata River to Chiloé Islandthat is the Mapuche heartland. The Mapuche population between Itata River and Reloncaví Sound has been estimated at 705,000–900,000 in the mid-sixteenth century by historian José Bengoa.

===Arauco War===
The Spanish expansion into Mapuche territory was an offshoot of the conquest of Peru. In 1536, Diego de Almagro set out to conquer Chile, after crossing the Itata River they were intercepted by a numerous contingent of Araucanian Mapuche armed with many bows and pikes in the Battle of Reynogüelén. Discouraged by the ferocity of the Mapuches, and the apparent lack of gold and silver in these lands, Almagro decided its full retreat the following year to Peru. In 1541, Pedro de Valdivia reached Chile from Cuzco and founded Santiago. The northern Mapuche tribes, known as Picunches had recently gained independence from Inca rule, being commanded by Michimalonco, who had defeated the Inca governor Quilicanta. It would be the same Michimalonco who would lead the Picunche resistance against the Spanish between 1541 and 1545. His most famous stain is the Destruction of Santiago.
In 1550, Pedro de Valdivia, who aimed to control all of Chile to the Straits of Magellan, campaigned in south-central Chile to conquer more Mapuche controlled territory. Between 1550 and 1553, the Spanish founded several cities in Mapuche lands including Concepción, Valdivia, Imperial, Villarrica, and Angol. The Spanish also established the forts of Arauco, Purén, and Tucapel. Further efforts by the Spanish to gain more territory engaged them in the Arauco War against the Mapuche, a sporadic conflict that lasted nearly 350 years. Hostility towards the conquerors was compounded by the lack of a tradition of forced labor akin to the Inca mit&#x27;a among the Mapuche, who largely refused to serve the Spanish.

From their establishment in 1550 to 1598, the Mapuche frequently laid siege to Spanish settlements in Araucanía. In 1553, the Mapuches held a council at which they resolved to make war. They chose as their &quot;toqui&quot; (wartime chief) a strong man called Caupolicán and as his vice toqui Lautaro, because he had served as an auxiliary to the Spanish cavalry; he created the first Mapuche cavalry corps. With six thousand warriors under his command, Lautaro attacked the fort at Tucapel. The Spanish garrison was unable to withstand the assault and retreated to Purén. Lautaro seized and burned the fort and prepared his army certain that the Spaniards would attempt to retake Tucapel. Valdivia mounted a counter-attack, but he was quickly surrounded. He and his army was massacred by the Mapuches in the Battle of Tucapel. In 1554 Lautaro went to destroy Concepción where in the Battle of Marihueñu he defeated Governor Villagra and devastated the city. In 1555 Lautaro went to the city of Angol and destroyed it, he also returned to Concepción, rebuilt by the Spanish and destroyed it again. In 1557 Lautaro headed with his army to destroy Santiago, fighting numerous battles with the Spanish along the way, but he and his army were devastated in the Battle of Mataquito.

From 1558 to 1598 war was mostly a low-intensity conflict. Mapuche numbers decreased significantly following contact with the Spanish invaders; wars and epidemics decimated the population. Others died in Spanish-owned gold mines.
In 1598 a party of warriors from Purén led by Pelantaro, who were returning south from a raid in the Chillán area, ambushed Governor Martín García Óñez de Loyola and his troops while they rested without taking any precautions against attack. Almost all the Spaniards died, save a cleric named Bartolomé Pérez, who was taken prisoner, and a soldier named Bernardo de Pereda. The Mapuche then initiated a general uprising that destroyed all the cities in their homeland south of the Biobío River.

In the years following the Battle of Curalaba, a general uprising developed among the Mapuches and Huilliches led to the Destruction of the Seven Cities. The Spanish cities of Angol, Imperial, Osorno, Santa Cruz de Oñez, Valdivia, and Villarrica were either destroyed or abandoned. The city of Castro was taken by a Dutch-Mapuche alliance in 1599, but reconquered by the Spanish in 1600. Only Chillán and Concepción resisted Mapuche sieges and raids. Except for the Chiloé Archipelago, all Chilean territory south of the Bíobío River was freed from Spanish rule. In this period the Mapuche Nation crossed the Andes to conquer the present Argentine provinces of Chubut, Neuquen, La Pampa, and Río Negro.

===Incorporation into Chile and Argentina===
In the nineteenth century, Argentina and Chile experienced a fast territorial expansion. Argentina established a colony at the Falkland Islands in 1820, settled Chubut with Welsh immigrants in 1865 and conquered Formosa, Misiones and Chaco from Paraguay in 1870. Later Argentina would also annex the Puna de Atacama in 1898. Chile on the other hand, established a colony at the Strait of Magellan in 1843, settled Valdivia, Osorno, and Llanquihue with German immigrants, and conquered land from Peru and Bolivia. Later Chile would also annex Easter Island. In this context, Mapuche controlled territory began to be conquered by Argentina and Chile due to two reasons. First, the Argentinean and Chilean states aimed for territorial continuity, and second it remained the sole place for Argentinean livestock to expand and Chilean agriculture to expand.

Between 1861 and 1879 Argentina and Chile incorporated several Mapuche territories to their controlled territory. In January 1881, having Chile decisively defeated Peru in the battles of Chorrillos and Miraflores, Chile and Argentina resumed the conquest of Mapuche controlled lands.

The conquest of Araucanía caused numerous Mapuches to be displaced and forced to roam in search of shelter and food. Scholar Pablo Miramán claims the introduction of state education during the Occupation of Araucanía had detrimental effects on traditional Mapuche education. Chile finally achieved the occupation and integration of the territories south of the Biobío River in 1884 when the last communities surrendered, and the cities of Villarrica and previously Angol were reestablished. Schools, cities, and legal systems were established, incorporating inhabitants into the national framework.

The rural-to-urban migration of the Mapuche people in the 20th century can be divided into two main stages: economic migration, which intensified from the 1920s and peaked in the 1950s and 1960s, and political migration following the 1973 coup. Economic migration initially responded to the need for jobs in cities, such as Santiago, where Mapuche arrived in the 1920s to work in bakeries and formed organizations like the &quot;Sociedad Galvarino.&quot; This migration flow was accentuated by industrial growth and the lack of rural opportunities. By 1961, it was estimated that up to 25% of the Mapuche population lived outside traditional communities, though data was incomplete, and censuses did not differentiate between Mapuche and non-Mapuche citizens.

Despite its impact, statistics on Mapuche rural-to-urban migration have historically been insufficient, marked by integrationist policies that did not account for their indigenous identity but treated them as citizens. Forced community divisions under laws such as the 1931 Decree with Force of Law No. 266 and the record-breaking divisions under Decree-Law No. 2568 of 1979 contributed to land fragmentation and forced migration to cities. In the 1952 census, only 875 Mapuche were recorded in Santiago, a figure significantly lower than independent estimates, such as Domingo Curaqueo&#x27;s, which identified 10 000 Mapuche over the age of 21 in the same province.
In the years following the occupation the economy of Araucanía changed from being based on sheep and cattle herding to one based on agriculture and wood extraction. About 70% of the Mapuche Territory left in the hands of Argentina, the loss of land by Mapuches following the occupation caused severe erosion since Mapuches continued to practice a massive livestock herding in limited areas.

== Modern political conflict (1990-) ==
The term &quot;Wallmapu&quot; began to gain widespread use outside Mapudungun-speaking communities after the Council of All Lands adopted its Mapudungun name, &quot;Aukiñ Wallmapu Ngulam,&quot; upon the organization&#x27;s founding in 1990. It arose in response to what indigenous movements describe as &quot;repression&quot; and the perceived disregard of land deeds (&quot;Títulos de Merced&quot;). This was accompanied by a wave of Mapuche migration from the south-central region to major Chilean cities during the Chilean military dictatorship and before. The council was notable for engaging in historical revisionism and adopting political stances opposing the Chilean state&#x27;s interests in the region, particularly regarding demands for &quot;ancestral land recovery&quot; and &quot;political territorial autonomy for the Mapuche people.&quot; This movement also included the creation of the Wenufoye national Mapuche flag in 1992, along with five additional flags representing key Mapuche territories in southern Chile. Since 2005, the term has also been promoted by the Mapuche nationalist party Wallmapuwen.

The Chilean historian Cristóbal García Huidobro states that: &quot;the terminology ‘Wallmapu’ is not a relatively old one, but rather a newer one. It arises, as far as it has been understood, from a revisionist movement, at the beginning of the 1990s (...) they make a re-study and a revisionism of the identity, of the language, as well as of the symbols that would represent the Mapuche people (...) it is not a historical question as such, it does not come from the ancestral culture of the Mapuche people who never perceived their territory as a particularly defined place&quot;. The term means &quot;Universe&quot; ancestraly in the Mapuche language.

The construction of the Ralco Hydroelectric Plant, which displaced indigenous burial sites, was a breaking point in state-Mapuche relations, contributing to the formation of the Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco (CAM) in December 1997 following the burning of three trucks belonging to Forestal Arauco. This first attack marks the beginning of the period of violence in the Southern Macrozone of Chile and a turning point in the development of the Mapuche autonomist political movement. Since then, violence has progressively increased and expanded to the neighboring regions of Biobío and Los Lagos.

Land disputes and violent confrontations continue in some Mapuche areas, particularly in the northern sections of the Araucanía region between and around Traiguén and Lumaco. In 2003, the Commission for Historical Truth and New Treatments issued a report to defuse tensions calling for drastic changes in Chile&#x27;s treatment of its indigenous people, more than 80% of whom are Mapuche. The recommendations included the formal recognition of political and &quot;territorial&quot; rights for indigenous peoples, as well as efforts to promote their cultural identities.

Though Japanese and Swiss interests are active in the economy of Araucanía (), the two chief forestry companies are Chilean-owned. In the past, the firms have planted hundreds of thousands of hectares with non-native species such as Monterey pine, Douglas firs, and eucalyptus trees, sometimes replacing native Valdivian forests, although such substitution and replacement is now forgotten.

Chile exports wood to the United States, almost all of which comes from this southern region, with an annual value of around $600 million. Stand.earth, a conservation group, has led an international campaign for preservation, resulting in the Home Depot chain and other leading wood importers agreeing to revise their purchasing policies to &quot;provide for the protection of native forests in Chile&quot;. Some Mapuche leaders want stronger protections for the forests.

In recent years, the crimes committed by Mapuche armed insurgents have been prosecuted under counter-terrorism legislation, originally introduced by the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet to control political dissidents. The law allows prosecutors to withhold evidence from the defense for up to six months and to conceal the identity of witnesses, who may give evidence in court behind screens. Insurgent groups, such as the Coordinadora Arauco Malleco, use multiple tactics with the more extreme occurrences such as the burning of homes, churches, vehicles, structures, and pastures, which at times included causing deaths and threats to specific targets. As of 2005, protesters from Mapuche communities have used these tactics against properties of both multinational forestry corporations and private individuals. In 2010 the Mapuche launched many hunger strikes in attempts to effect change in the anti-terrorism legislation.
As of 2019, the Chilean government committed human rights abuses against the Mapuche based on Israeli military techniques and surveillance according to the French website Orin21.

In May 2022, the Chamber of Deputies of Chile declared the Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco, Resistencia Mapuche Malleco, Resistencia Mapuche Lafkenche, and Weichán Auka Mapu as &quot;illegal terrorist organizations&quot;.

Oil exploitation and fracking in the Vaca Muerta site in Neuquen, one of the biggest shale-oil and shale-gas deposits in the world, has produced waste dumps of sludge waste, polluting the environment close to the town of Añelo, which is about 1,200km south of Buenos Aires. In 2018, the Mapuche were suing Exxon, French company TotalEnergies and Pan American Energy.

== Culture ==

At the time of the arrival of Europeans, the Mapuche organized and constructed a network of forts and defensive buildings. Ancient Mapuche also built ceremonial constructions such as some earthwork mounds discovered near Purén. Mapuche quickly adopted iron metal-working (Picunches already worked copper) Mapuche learned horse riding and the use of cavalry in war from the Spaniards, along with the cultivation of wheat and sheep.

In the 300-year co-existence between the Spanish colonies and the relatively well-delineated autonomous Mapuche regions, the Mapuche also developed a strong tradition of trading with Spaniards, Argentines, and Chileans. Such trade lies at the heart of the Mapuche silver-working tradition, for Mapuche wrought their jewelry from the large and widely dispersed quantity of Spanish, Argentine, and Chilean silver coins. Mapuche also made headdresses with coins, which were called &quot;trarilonko,&quot; etc.

===Mapuche languages===
Mapuche languages are spoken in Chile and Argentina. The two living branches are Huilliche and Mapudungun. Although not genetically related, lexical influence has been discerned from Quechua. Linguists estimate that only about 200,000 full-fluency speakers remain in Chile. The language receives only token support in the educational system. In recent years, it has started to be taught in rural schools of Bío-Bío, Araucanía, and Los Lagos Regions.

Mapuche speakers of Chilean Spanish who also speak Mapudungun tend to use more impersonal pronouns when speaking Spanish.

===Cosmology and beliefs===
Central to Mapuche cosmology is the idea of a creator called , who is embodied in four components: an older man (), an older woman (), a young man, and a young woman. They believe in worlds known as the and . Also, Mapuche cosmology is informed by complex notions of spirits that coexist with humans and animals in the natural world, and daily circumstances can dictate spiritual practices.

The most well-known Mapuche ritual ceremony is the , which loosely translates as &quot;to pray&quot; or &quot;general prayer&quot;. These ceremonies are often major communal events that are of extreme spiritual and social importance. Many other ceremonies are practiced, and not all are for public or communal participation but are sometimes limited to family.

The main groups of deities and/or spirits in Mapuche mythology are the and (ancestral spirits), the (spirits in nature), and the (evil spirits).

Central to Mapuche belief is the role of the (shaman). It is usually filled by a woman, following an apprenticeship with an older machi, and has many of the characteristics typical of shamans. The machi performs ceremonies for curing diseases, warding off evil, influencing weather, harvests, social interactions, and dreamwork. Machis often have extensive knowledge of regional medicinal herbs. As biodiversity in the Chilean countryside has declined due to commercial agriculture and forestry, the dissemination of such knowledge has also declined, but the Mapuche people are reviving it in their communities. Machis have an extensive knowledge of sacred stones and sacred animals.
Like many cultures, the Mapuche have a deluge myth () of a major flood in which the world is destroyed and recreated. The myth involves two opposing forces: (water, which brings death through floods) and (dry earth, which brings sunshine). In the deluge almost all humanity is drowned; the few not drowned survive through cannibalism. At last, only one couple is left. A machi tells them that they must give their only child to the waters, which they do, and this restores order to the world.

Part of the Mapuche ritual is prayer and animal sacrifice, required to maintain the cosmic balance. This belief has continued to current times. In 1960, for example, a machi sacrificed a young boy, throwing him into the water after an earthquake and a tsunami.

The Mapuche have incorporated the remembered history of their long independence and resistance from 1540 (Spanish and then Chileans and Argentines) and of the treaty with the Chilean and Argentine governments in the 1870s. Memories, stories, and beliefs, often very local and particularized, are a significant part of the Mapuche traditional culture. To varying degrees, this history of resistance continues to this day amongst the Mapuche. At the same time, a large majority of Mapuche in Chile identify with the state as Chilean, similar to a large majority in Argentina identifying as Argentines.

===Textiles===
One of the best-known arts of the Mapuche is their textiles. The oldest data on textiles in the southernmost areas of the American continent (southern Chile and Argentina today) are found in some archaeological excavations, such as those of Pitrén Cemetery near the city of Temuco, and the Alboyanco site in the Biobío Region, both of Chile; and the Rebolledo Arriba Cemetery in Neuquén Province (Argentina). researchers have found evidence of fabrics made with complex techniques and designs, dated between AD 1300–1350.

The Mapuche women were responsible for spinning and weaving. Knowledge of both weaving techniques and textile patterns particular to the locality was usually transmitted within the family, with mothers, grandmothers, and aunts teaching a girl the skills they had learned from their elders. Women who excelled in the textile arts were highly honored for their accomplishments and contributed economically and culturally to their kinship group. A measure of the importance of weaving is evident in the expectation that a man gives a larger dowry for a bride who was an accomplished weaver.

In addition, the Mapuche used their textiles as an important surplus and an exchange trading good. Numerous sixteenth-century accounts describe their bartering the textiles with other indigenous peoples, and with colonists in newly developed settlements. Such trading enabled the Mapuche to obtain those goods that they did not produce or held in high esteem, such as horses. Tissue volumes made by Aboriginal women and marketed in the Araucanía and the north of Patagonia Argentina were considerable and constituted a vital economic resource for indigenous families. The production of fabrics in the time before European settlement was intended for uses beyond domestic consumption.

At present, the fabrics woven by the Mapuche continue to be used for domestic purposes, as well as for gift, sale, or barter. Most Mapuche women and their families now wear garments with foreign designs and tailored with materials of industrial origin, but they continue to weave ponchos, blankets, bands, and belts for regular use. Many of the fabrics are woven for trade, and in many cases, are an important source of income for families. Glazed pots are used to dye the wool. Many Mapuche women continue to weave fabrics according to the customs of their ancestors and transmit their knowledge in the same way: within domestic life, from mother to daughter, and from grandmothers to granddaughters. This form of learning is based on gestural imitation, and only rarely, and when strictly necessary, the apprentice receives explicit instructions or help from their instructors. Knowledge is transmitted as the fabric is woven, the weaving and transmission of knowledge go together.

===Clava hand-club===
There is a traditional stone hand club used by the Mapuche which has been called a (Spanish for club). It has a long flat body. Another name is ; in Spanish, it may also be called a . It has some ritual importance as a special sign of distinction carried by tribal chiefs. Many kinds of clubs are known.

This is an object associated with masculine power. It consists of a disk with an attached handle; the edge of the disc usually has a semicircular recess. In many cases, the face portrayed on the disc carries incised designs. The handle is cylindrical, generally with a larger diameter at its connection to the disk.

===Silverwork===
In the later half of the eighteenth century, Mapuche silversmiths began to produce large amounts of silver finery. The surge of silversmithing activity may be related to the 1726 parliament of Negrete that decreased hostilities between Spaniards and Mapuches and allowed trade to increase between colonial Chile and the free Mapuches. In this context of increasing trade Mapuches began in the late eighteenth century to accept payments in silver coins for their products, usually cattle or horses. These coins and silver coins obtained in political negotiations served as raw material for Mapuche metalsmiths (). Old Mapuche silver pendants often included unmelted silver coins, something that has helped modern researchers to date the objects. The bulk of the Spanish silver coins originated from mining in Potosí in Upper Peru.

The great diversity in silver finery designs is because designs were made to be identified with different (families), (lands) as well as specific and . Mapuche silver finery was also subject to changes in fashion albeit designs associated with philosophical and spiritual concepts have not undergone major changes.

In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, Mapuche silversmithing activity and artistic diversity reached its climax. All important Mapuche chiefs of the nineteenth century are supposed to have had at least one silversmith. By 1984 Mapuche scholar Carlos Aldunate noted that there were no silversmiths alive among contemporary Mapuches.

===Literature===
The Mapuche culture of the sixteenth century had an oral tradition and lacked a writing system. Since that time, a writing system for Mapudungun was developed, and Mapuche writings in both Spanish and Mapudungun have flourished. Contemporary Mapuche literature can be said to be composed of an oral tradition and Spanish-Mapudungun bilingual writings. Notable Mapuche poets include Sebastián Queupul, Pedro Alonzo, Elicura Chihuailaf, and Leonel Lienlaf.

=== Cogender views ===
Among the Mapuche in La Araucanía, in addition to heterosexual female shamanesses, there are homosexual male shamans, who wear female clothing. These were first described in Spanish in a chronicle of 1673. Among the Mapuche, &quot;the spirits are interested in machi&#x27;s gendered discourses and performances, not in the sex under the machi&#x27;s clothes&quot;. In attracting the (possessing spirit), &quot;Both male and female become spiritual brides who seduce and call their – at once husband and master – to possess their heads ... The ritual transvestism of male ... draws attention to the relational gender categories of spirit husband and wife as a couple ().&quot; As concerning &quot;co-gendered identities&quot; of &quot; as co-gender specialists&quot;, it has been speculated that &quot;female berdaches&quot; may have formerly existed among the Mapuche.

==Mapuche, Chileans and the Chilean state==
Following the independence of Chile in the 1810s, the Mapuche began to be perceived as Chilean by other Chileans, contrasting with previous perceptions of them as a separate people or nation. However, not everybody agreed; 19th-century Argentine writer and president Domingo Faustino Sarmiento presented his view of the Mapuche-Chile relation by stating:

===Civilizing mission discourses and scientific racism===
The events surrounding the wreck of &quot;Joven Daniel&quot; at the coast of Araucanía in 1849 are considered an &quot;inflection point&quot; or &quot;point of no return&quot; in the relations between Mapuches and the Chilean state. It cemented views of Mapuches as brutal barbarians and showed in the view of many that Chilean authorities&#x27; earlier goodwill was naive.

There are various recorded instances in the nineteenth century when Mapuches were the subject of civilizing mission discourses by elements of the Chilean government and military. For example, Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez called in 1861 for Mapuches to submit to Chilean state authority and &quot;enter into reduction and civilization&quot;. When the Mapuches were finally defeated in 1883 President Domingo Santa María declared:


After the War of the Pacific (1879–1883) there was a rise of racial and national superiority ideas among the Chilean ruling class. It was in this context that Chilean physician Nicolás Palacios hailed the Mapuche &quot;race&quot; arguing from a scientific racist and nationalist point of view. He considered the Mapuche superior to other tribes and the Chilean mestizo a blend of Mapuches and Visigothic elements from Spain. The writings of Palacios became later influential among Chilean Nazis.

As a result of the Occupation of Araucanía (1861–1883) and the War of the Pacific, Chile had incorporated territories with new indigenous populations. Mapuches obtained relatively favourable views as &quot;primordial&quot; Chileans contrasting with other indigenous peoples like the Aymara who were perceived as &quot;foreign elements&quot;.

===Contemporary attitudes===

Contemporary attitudes towards Mapuches on the part of non-indigenous people in Chile are highly individual and heterogeneous. Nevertheless, a considerable part of the non-indigenous people in Chile have a prejudiced and discriminatory attitude towards Mapuche. In a 2003 study, it was found that among the sample, 41% of people over 60 years old, 35% of people of low socioeconomic standing, 35% of the supporters of right-wing parties, 36% of Protestants, and 26% of Catholics were prejudiced against indigenous peoples in Chile. In contrast, only 8% of those who attended university, 16% of supporters of left-wing parties, and 19% of people aged 18–29 were prejudiced. Specific prejudices about the Mapuche are that the Mapuches are lazy and alcoholic; to some lesser degree, Mapuche are sometimes judged antiquated and dirty.

In the 20th century, many Mapuche women migrated to large cities to work as domestic workers (). In Santiago, many of these women settled in Cerro Navia and La Pintana. Sociologist Éric Fassin has called the occurrence of Mapuche domestic workers a continuation of colonial relations of servitude.
Historian Gonzalo Vial claimed that the Republic of Chile owes a &quot;historical debt&quot; to the Mapuche. The Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco claims to have the goal of a &quot;national liberation&quot; of Mapuche, with their regaining sovereignty over their lands. Reportedly there is a tendency among female Mapuche activists to reject feminism as they consider their struggle to go beyond gender.

==Mapuches and the Argentine state==

19th-century Argentine authorities aiming to incorporate the Pampas and Patagonia into national territory recognized the Puelmapu Mapuche&#x27;s strong connections with Chile. This gave Chile a certain influence over the Pampas. Argentine authorities feared that in an eventual war with Chile over Patagonia, Mapuches would align themselves with Chile. In this context, Estanislao Zeballos published the work (&quot;The Fifteen Thousand League Conquest&quot;) in 1878, which had been commissioned by the Argentine Ministry of War. In Mapuches were presented as Chileans who were bound to return to Chile. Mapuches were thus indirectly considered foreign enemies. Such a notion fitted well with the expansionist designs of Nicolás Avellaneda and Julio Argentino Roca for Puelmapu. The notion of Mapuches as Chileans is however an anachronism as Mapuches precede the formation of the modern state of Chile. By 1920 Argentine revived the idea of Mapuches being Chileans, in strong contrast with 20th-century scholars based in Chile such as Ricardo E. Latcham and Francisco Antonio Encina who advanced a theory that Mapuches originated east of the Andes before penetrating what came to be Chile.

As late as 2017 Argentine historian Roberto E. Porcel wrote in a communiqué to the National Academy of History that those who often claim to be Mapuches in Argentina would be rather Mestizos, emboldened by European-descent supporters, who &quot;lack any right for their claims and violence, not only for NOT being most of them Araucanians [sic], but also because they [the Araucanians] do not rank among our indigenous peoples&quot;.

== Modern politics ==
In the 2017 Chilean general election, the first two Mapuche women were elected to the Chilean Congress; Aracely Leuquén Uribe from National Renewal and Emilia Nuyado from the Socialist Party.

<text>Jigme Singye Wangchuck (, ; born 11 November 1955), is the fourth Druk Gyalpo (Dragon King) of Bhutan, reigning from 1972 to 2006. He is the father of the present King of Bhutan Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuck. He is the only son of five children born to the Third King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and Queen Mother Ashi Kesang Choden Wangchuck.

Jigme Singye Wangchuck studied at St. Joseph&#x27;s School, Darjeeling, in India. In January 1965, he attended Summerfields School in St. Leonards, Sussex, England, and then Heatherdown School in 1966 where he completed his studies in 1969. After completion of his studies in 1970, he was appointed as the Chairman of the National Planning Commission in the year 1971 by the Third King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck. At the age of 16, he was appointed as the Trongsa Penlop and bestowed with saffron scarf. On July 21, 1972, the Third King of Bhutan passed away, and at the age of 16, Crown Prince Jigme Singye Wangchuck, ascended the throne, becoming the world&#x27;s youngest monarch at the time. Just three days after his father&#x27;s passing, the Crown Prince assumed leadership of the government and the nation. His coronation ceremony was later held on June 2, 1974, in Thimphu.

During his reign, Bhutan transitioned from an Absolute Monarchy to Democratic Constitutional Monarchy. This progress towards to a Democratic Constitutional Monarchy started with decentralization of power to people on the grass root level. He initiated Dzongkhag Yargye Tshogdu (DYT) in 1981 and the Gewog Yargye Tshogchung (GYT) in 1991 in order to ensure people&#x27;s participation and local governance. In 2001, a Constitution Drafting Committee was established under royal decree. The King personally presented the Constitution of Bhutan to citizens across all 20 Dzongkhags, with every word considered meaningful and sanctified by the people. It was introduced as &quot;the People&#x27;s Constitution,&quot; symbolizing its alignment with the aspirations of the Bhutanese people. The Constitution of Bhutan was enacted July 18, 2008 by the Royal Government.

He introduced the Gross National Happiness (GNH) philosophy in the early 1970s, emphasizing holistic development over purely economic growth. In 2003, he personally led Operation All Clear, a military campaign to expel insurgent groups from southern Bhutan, marking a unique instance of a head of state leading troops into action. After 34 years of rule, he voluntarily abdicated in 2006 at 51 years old, overseeing a peaceful transition to Democracy through a transparent constitutional process.

Throughout his reign, Jigme Singye Wangchuck implemented various socio-economic policies to enhance the quality of life in Bhutan. He emphasized the need to develop industry, agriculture, hydroelectricity, and infrastructural projects while prioritizing environmental and cultural preservation. The success of these policies can be seen in indicators such as increased access to education and healthcare, improvements in infrastructure, and the promotion of Bhutan&#x27;s unique cultural heritage. He was also responsible for the development of new policies in the environment and improved access to education and healthcare.

==Early life==
Jigme Singye Wangchuck was born in Dechencholing Palace in Thimphu, Bhutan, on 11 November 1955 to Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and &quot;Ashi&quot; Kesang Choden Wangchuck. The political officer of India stationed in Sikkim, along with a representative of the Sikkimese government came to offer felicitations to the royal parents. At the age of four, sometime in 1959, the young Crown Prince made his first public appearance in Tashichho Dzong.

==Education==
Jigme Singye Wangchuck began his education when he was six years old, in 1961, receiving a blend of both Buddhist and secular curricula at Dechencholing Palace. His formal education started with traditional teaching and was followed by the study of English and modern subjects, taught by trained teachers at the palace. The school at Dechencholing began with 45 students. Soon afterward, he went to study at St. Joseph&#x27;s School, Darjeeling, in India. In January 1965, he attended Summerfields School in St. Leonards, Sussex, England, and then Heatherdown School in 1966 where he completed his studies in 1969. The next phase of his formal education took place at Namselling Palace in 1969. Finally, he attended Ugyen Wangchuck Academy at Satsham Choten in Paro, which was established in 1970, along with a class of selected students from all over Bhutan.

==Crown Prince==
In 1971, the Third King of Bhutan appointed Wangchuck as the Chairman of the National Planning Commission, charged with the planning and coordination of the five-year development plan. The following year, on 16 June 1972, he was made the Trongsa Penlop, a role that including him receiving the saffron scarf or namza. During the 3rd Five-Year Plan (FYP), which spanned 1971–77, his father died. He was 16 at that time. 1972 to 1976 was the period of the 3rd FYP, and 1976 to 1981 was the period of the 4th FYP. As both King and the Chairman of the National Planning Commission, the clearing house for the programs and projects, Wangchuck guided the planned activities first in broad terms and then increasingly in detail.

==Coronation==
The coronation of Jigme Singye Wangchuck as the Fourth King of Bhutan was conducted in three distinct ceremonies, as in Bhutanese tradition. The inner coronation took place at Punakha Dzong in 1972 and involved religious rituals led by Je Khenpo Yonten Thaye, while the secret coronation in 1974 at Tashichhodzong took place at a moment considered auspicious in the traditional calendar and included Buddhist masters. The outer coronation on 2 June 1974 was a public event attended by international representatives. The Presidents of India and Bangladesh were the guests of honor. The Chogyal of Sikkim and the Prince of Nepal were among the attendees.

===Royal wedding===
Jigme Singye Wangchuck married four sisters in a Dechog Lhakhang in Punakha Dzong on 31 October 1988, a date corresponding with the Buddhist holiday of Lhabab Duchen, or Descending Day of Buddha. The four queens, Dorji Wangmo Wangchuck, Tshering Pem Wangchuck, Tshering Yangdon Wangchuck and Sangay Choden Wangchuck are daughters of &quot;Dasho Yab&quot; Ugyen Dorji, the descendant of both the mind and speech incarnations of Ngawang Namgyal, and &quot;Yum&quot; Thuiji Zam. Previously, they had married privately in 1979.

==Socio-economic development==
The socio-economic development of Bhutan under King Jigme Singye Wangchuck was characterized by significant advancements across various sectors, including Gross National Happiness (GNH) as a guiding principle.
===1. Introduction of Gross National Happiness (GNH)===

His Majesty believed that true progress for the Bhutanese people should be assessed through their happiness and overall quality of life. This belief is deeply rooted in Bhutan&#x27;s ancient legal code from 1629, which stated that &quot;if the government cannot create happiness for its people, then there is no purpose for the government to exist.&quot; This code, written by a Buddhist teacher, emphasized that laws must promote happiness for all sentient beings, a principle found in the Buddhist teachings.
A 1986 royal decree instructed the Planning Commission to evaluate the nation&#x27;s progress based on the happiness and comfort of its people under the auspices the 6th Five Year Plan. GNH is structured to include measurements of well-being rather than purely economic indicators. its four pillars are : 1. Sustainable and equitable socioeconomic development; 2. Conservation of the Environment; 3. Preservation and Promotion of Culture; and 4. Good Governance.

In 2008, Bhutan&#x27;s Constitution enshrined GNH values in Article 9, which mandates the state to promote conditions conducive to pursuing happiness.

Today, GNH is defined as a &quot;multidimensional development approach seeking to achieve a harmonious balance between material well-being and the spiritual, emotional, and cultural needs of society,&quot; emphasizing the need to balance physical and mental well-being.

===2. Improvements in Healthcare===
1. Expansion of Healthcare Infrastructure

- Increased Facilities: The number of healthcare facilities grew substantially, from just 56 in 1974 to 715 by 2006. This included the establishment of hospitals and basic health units across the country.

- Accessibility: The expansion of the healthcare network provided increased access to medical services, especially in rural areas.

2. Improvement in Health Outcomes

- Life Expectancy: Life expectancy increased from around 40 years in the early 1970s to 66 years by 2006.

- Infant and Maternal Mortality Rates: Infant mortality dropped significantly from 142 per 1,000 live births in 1985 to 60 in 2006. Maternal mortality also decreased from 7.7% to 2.6% during this period, associated with improved access to prenatal and postnatal care.

3. Universal Health Coverage

- Free Primary Health Care: By the end of King Jigme Singye&#x27;s reign, Bhutan achieved nearly universal coverage for primary healthcare services, with a focus on providing free medical care to all citizens.

4. Focus on Preventive Care

- Public Health Campaigns: The government launched vaccination programs that contributed to a significant reduction in communicable diseases.

- Access to Clean Water and Nutrition: Efforts were made to improve access to safe drinking water and nutrition.

5. Human Resource Development

- Training Programs: The establishment of institutions like the Royal Institute of Health Sciences in 1976 helped train healthcare professionals to address the shortage of qualified personnel.

- Increased Workforce: By 2006, there was an increase in the number of health workers per capita compared to before 1976, enhancing service delivery.

===3. Education Expansion===

Bhutan experienced substantial transformations during this period, with advancements in the education sector. This shift was part of broader initiatives focused on national development and enhancing public welfare.

In 1974, when Jigme Singye Wangchuck ascended to the throne, only 14,000 pupils were enrolled in school. There were no degree-granting colleges at all. A cornerstone of Jigme Singye Wangchuck&#x27;s educational policy was to significantly expand access to learning opportunities across the kingdom. The following steps were taken:

Schools were constructed in isolated regions. Overall, the number of educational institutions expanded from 97 in 1974 to 322 in 1998.

Bhutan currently has 243 primary and community schools, 44 junior high schools, 18 high schools and a range of other institutions that provide secondary and tertiary education; technical, managerial and vocational training.

Prioritizing Quality and Relevance: Jigme Singye Wangchuck further promoted efforts to improve the quality and relevance of education. He did so in the following ways:

Established Teacher Training Institutions: The Royal Bhutan Polytechnic and the National Institute of Education were key training centers. It included 2 technical schools, 1 rigney (an educational institution with a focus on Buddhist studies and Bhutanese culture) school, 1 fine arts center, 1 school of Buddhist studies, and a teacher training institute&quot;.

Curriculum Reform: Schools included lessons that taught about the different populations and regions of the country.

Student Overseas Opportunities: Thousands of government issued scholarships were provided to Bhutanese for study abroad to benefit their training or pursue education.

===4. Infrastructure Development===

In the early 1970s, Bhutan was a largely isolated, agrarian society with limited infrastructure. Key priorities under Jigme Singye Wangchuck&#x27;s leadership included building essential services and infrastructure to alleviate societal challenges.

Early Industrial Development:

Early on, efforts were made to foster domestic industries. By 1973, an industrial estate in Phuntsholing was under construction, and provide entrepreneurs with work sheds equipped with necessary amenities.
Loans were provided to industrialists to establish enterprises contributing to the national economy.
Gelephu in southern Bhutan was emerging as an industrial center.
These included furniture production, sawmills, as well as a match factory with the objective of supplying matches to the entire country.

Key Themes and Approaches:

Several key themes emerge from Wangchuck&#x27;s approach to infrastructure development, as evident in his own words, stressing the importance of self-reliance. &quot;It is imperative that the people and the government unite and work hand in hand in developing and building a better future for our country”.
&quot;From year to year, Bhutan is receiving increasing financial and technical assistance from many countries ... However, the most important task before us at present is to achieve economic self-reliance to ensure the continued progress of our country in the future.

Economic Empowerment in Rural Development.

He stressed agriculture as the core of Bhutan&#x27;s identity in order to promote a balanced society

Diversification of the Economy: Priority was given to high-yield agriculture and providing access to credit to increase production. In addition, there was an emphasis on industry, hydroelectricity, and other infrastructure to improve peoples’ standard of living.

To increase labour productivity among the farmers, imported farm machinery was procured at subsidized prices and distributed to the people along with improved farming tools.

===5. Tourism and Hydropower Development===

Jigme Singye Wangchuck&#x27;s reign was marked by significant growth in tourism and hydropower development. Development was aimed at remote areas where it could improve the life of the people. According to his address to the people of Mongar in 1980, the Royal Government was emphasizing “...to remain as a sovereign independent country and achieve economic self-reliance, prosperity, peace and happiness for our people.&quot; and the way to achieve that was through Tourism and Hydropower development.

Hydropower Development

Strategic Importance:

Hydropower became a cornerstone of Bhutan&#x27;s economic development, serving both domestic needs and as a major export earner. According to His Majesty&#x27;s words, “...to achieve economic self-reliance...&quot; the development of industries including hydropower is necessary.

Early Initiatives:

The Chukha Hydel Project, commissioned in 1987, was an early hydropower effort. It became a significant source of revenue, primarily through exports to India.

Later Projects:

Jigme Singye Wangchuck highlighted that the total expected revenue from Paro during the 5th FYP was Nu. 30.000 million as compared to the total revenue of Nu. 2.742 million in the Fourth Plan&quot; indicating ongoing emphasis on revenue generation. The Kurichu Power Project, bourne from a 1994 agreement with India, was started (2001).

Tourism Development

Controlled Approach:

Bhutan opened to tourism in the 1970s, before which time the country remained largely isolated. Limited numbers of foreign dignitaries were permitted to enter Bhutan for the first time for the Fourth King&#x27;s coronation celebrations. During Jigme Singye Wangchuck&#x27;s reign,
Bhutan adopted a &quot;high-value, low-impact&quot; tourism policy. This policy, rooted in GNH philosophy, prioritized cultural preservation and environmental protection over maximizing tourist numbers.
Aviation and Accessibility:

To facilitate tourism, Druk Air launched aviation services in 1983. Druk Air, initially using Dornier aircraft, later upgraded to BAe jet planes with routes to major cities in South and Southeast Asia. 
Economic Contribution: Jigme Singye Wangchuck&#x27;s policy included that tourism revenues would be used in development projects.

Speeches and Principles

In his address to the National Assembly on September 10, 1972, shortly after his ascension to the throne, Jigme Singye Wnagchuck spoke about the wisdom of his late father, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, and stated that it would be best to continue in line with the policies laid down by his father, at least initially. Jigme Singye Wangchuck wanted “a sustainable balance among economic, social, emotional and cultural needs of the people.” His hydropower development policy aimed for economic self-reliance without sacrificing social and cultural values. In an address at the 1978 National Day celebration, he emphasized &quot;...Government and people must work together.&quot; In an address to the 54th session of the National Assembly on June 23, 1981, he stated &quot; “We cannot depend forever on the generosity of our friends. Nor can we progress by depending on others. No country has advanced by allowing another country to do all its development work&quot;, He repeatedly pointed out. He went on to emphasize, &quot;We must have the capacity to begin and complete any project we undertake.”

==Preservation of Culture==
Modernization can pose challenges to both culture and the environment. However, under Wangchuck&#x27;s reign, efforts were made to mitigate this pressure by emphasizing the role of cultural preservation in maintaining national identity and stability. Wangchuck emphasized the distinctive characters of Bhutanese cultures. Wangchuck stated that it is the &quot;distinct identity of our county&quot;, and not the nation&#x27;s &quot;wealth, weapons and armed forces&quot;, that is the vital instrument in securing the sovereignty of the nation.

As an example of Wangchuck&#x27;s support of classical Bhutanese culture, he supported the construction of Tango Shedra. Tango Shedra enabled high-level study of the classical system of Bhuddhist cultural sciences. Academic monks complete their long studies with bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in Tango. In 2008, 163 candidates – with 14 master&#x27;s degrees and 149 bachelor&#x27;s degrees –from Tango Shedra and Sangngag Chokhor Shedra in Paro held their graduation ceremonies at Tango.

Wangchuck established the Zorig Chusum, formerly Kawajangsa Institution of Zorig (now known as the National Institute for Zorig Chusum) in 1971 was established. At first, the institute concentrated on traditional fine arts. A similar institution was opened in 1997 in Tashi Yangtse. The Folk Heritage Museum started by Her Majesty &quot;Ashi&quot; Dorji Wangmo Wangchuck in Kawajangsa, Thimphu in 2001, drew attention to the heritage of lay people&#x27;s sustainable products and their lifestyle. Likewise, in 2001, the first Textile Museum opened by Her Majesty &quot;Ashi&quot; Sangay Choden Wangchuck drew attention to the weaving skills of Bhutan. Skilled artisans – painters, statue-makers, carpenters, and masons proliferated in Wangchuck&#x27;s reign not only because of these new institutions but also by receiving on-the-job training in many new temples and dzongs constructed in the country.

Wangchuck raised the profile of indigenous medicine during his reign by making indigenous medicine available as a parallel health service through the Institute of Indigenous Medicine.

When his reign started in 1972, there were approximately 2,000 monks in state-supported monasteries. By 2006, the number of monks subsisting on state allowances had increased to over 6,000. In parallel to the increase in the number of monks and nuns, the monastic infrastructure that included tutors, lamas, temples, (meditation centers), and Shedras (Buddhist colleges), increased in Wangchuck&#x27;s reign. Many new official Dratshangs were established in district headquarters that previously didn&#x27;t have monastic body, including Tsirang, Gaylegphug, Tashi Yangtse, Samtse, Pema Gatshel, Chukha, Bumthang and Zhemgang. Numerous affiliate monasteries to each dzongkhag rabdey were also opened throughout the country.

By 2006, there were 13 Shedras located in Tango, Dodeydrag, Khothokha, Sanga Choekhor, Gontey, Tshangkha, Tharpaling, Nimalung, Talo Nalanda, Sewla, Ngatsang, Drametse, and Bartsham with a total enrolment of some 700 monks. There were over 24 or meditation places, stretching from Singye dzong in the east to Tagchu Goenpa in Haa, enlisting 300 officially supported people who meditate on a long-term basis in 2006. These numbers were rolled as new meditation to succeed old ones upon their completion. There were over 45 monastic Lobdras, where teachers received official stipends and where (young lay priests) studied. By 2006, there were also 10 nunneries, started on an organized basis, located in Jashar Goenpa in Pema Gatshel in the east to Kila Goenpa in Paro in the west.

==Environmental Conservation==
Wangchuck also enhanced the protection of natural resources such as forests and biodiversity. Wangchuck foresaw the potentially adverse impacts of both increased economic activity and increased population on the fragility of the mountain ecosystem. He raised the importance of the preservation of the environment during policy discussions, which resulted in vast areas of the country being devoted to parks and sanctuaries.

===Environmental Stewardship of Jigme Singye Wangchuck===

===Dedicating Land to Parks and Sanctuaries===
* Jigme Dorji National Park, Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary and Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary declared in 1974
* Toorsa Nature Reserve, Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park (known earlier as Jow Durshing National Park), Thrumsengla National Park, Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary and Bomdeling Wildlife Sanctuary established in 1993. These efforts expanded Bhutan&#x27;s network of parks and sanctuaries to safeguard its biodiversity.

===International Recognitions===
* Bhutan was identified as a global hotspot, in 1988
* UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Convention on Biological Diversity signed in 1995
* Wangchuck and the people of Bhutan received the &quot;Champions of the Earth&quot; Award from UNEP, 2005
* In 2006, he was conferred the J. Paul Getty Conservation Leadership Award for his leadership in conservation. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), this recognition highlighted his role in establishing policies and laws that positively impacted conservation in Bhutan and set an example globally. The award carried a cash prize of $200,000. Wangchuck stated that the award symbolized the collective efforts of the government and people of Bhutan.
* On February 13, 2011, Wangchuck was inducted into the Kyoto Earth Hall of Fame for his contributions to environmental conservation. Accepting the award in Kyoto, Her Royal Highness Princess Ashi Kezang Choden Wangchuck highlighted Bhutan&#x27;s 72% forest cover and carbon-neutral pledge, dedicating the honor to the Bhutanese people and global environmental efforts.
* Wangchuck received the 2022 Blue Planet Prize from the Asahi Glass Foundation on October 5, 2022, in recognition of his Gross National Happiness (GNH) philosophy, which integrates environmental conservation as a core pillar. Her Royal Highness Princess Sonam Dechan Wangchuck accepted the award on his behalf, emphasizing that it was a tribute to Bhutan&#x27;s collective commitment to ecological balance and sustainable development.

===Policy Development===
* In 1985, Bhutan introduced Environmental Studies as part of its school curriculum. This initiative aimed to promote awareness and understanding of environmental issues among students. By integrating environmental education into the curriculum, the government sought to instill a sense of responsibility for the environment from an early age.
* National Environment Commission established in 1990. It was created as a central body to oversee environmental governance and policy implementation. Initially part of the Planning Commission, it later became an autonomous entity responsible for coordinating environmental activities, formulating policies, and ensuring that development projects are environmentally sustainable.
* Bhutan Trust Fund for Environment established in 1992. The Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation was created as a financial mechanism to support conservation efforts. It was one of the first trust funds of its kind globally and has since provided funding for various projects aimed at protecting Bhutan&#x27;s biodiversity and promoting sustainable resource management.
* Environment Assessment Act, 2000. It established a legal framework for assessing the environmental impacts of proposed development projects. The act mandates that all projects undergo an environmental assessment process to ensure that potential adverse effects on the environment are identified and mitigated before implementation.
* Bio-diversity Act of Bhutan, 2003. It was established to protect and regulate the use of the country&#x27;s biological resources. The act aims to conserve Bhutan&#x27;s biodiversity while ensuring that the use of biological resources is equitable and sustainable. It also provides guidelines for access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing mechanisms.

==Transition to Democracy==
Since 2008, Bhutan has been a Bhutanese Democracy|Democratic Constitutional Monarchy with the Druk Gyalpo as the head of the state and the existence of multiple political parties. This transition from Absolute Monarchy to Democratic Constitutional Monarchy began in the reign of the Fourth Druk Gyalpo. Democratization started when Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, created a National Assembly in 1953.

A key aspect of his legacy was his role in advancing democracy in Bhutan. He believed that relying solely on a single individual for governance was a risk for a small, landlocked nation with a limited population. Jigme Singye Wangchuck played a significant role in advancing the process of democratization in Bhutan by decentralizing power from the central government to local authorities. In 1981, he established the Dzongkhag Yargye Tshogdu (Dzongkhag Development Committee) and later the Gewog Yargye Tshogchung (Block Development Committee) in 1991. These initiatives aimed to enhance public participation in decision-making and prepare citizens for democratic governance.

Key developments leading up to the democratic elections in 2008 included the dissolution of the Cabinet in 1998, which resulted in the election of a Council of Ministers endowed with full executive powers by representatives of the people. This was followed by the formation of a Constitution Drafting Committee in 2001 under royal command. The Constitution of Bhutan was presented to the citizens across the 20 Dzongkhags by the King, with each word being regarded as significant and blessed by the people of the nation. The constitution was presented as the &#x27;the People&#x27;s Constitution&#x27; reflecting its intended alignment with the aspiration of Bhutanese citizens. During the ceremony, he expressed that this document symbolizes a pivotal moment in Bhutan&#x27;s democratic journey, marking a commitment to uphold the rights and responsibilities enshrined within it. The event underscored the unique manner in which democracy was introduced in Bhutan, reflecting a collaborative effort between the monarchy and the citizens to establish a constitutional framework that would guide the nation&#x27;s governance. These reforms reduced the monarchy&#x27;s powers, transferring authority to elected officials and laying the foundation for Bhutan&#x27;s transition to a constitutional monarchy.

The emergence of democracy in Bhutan is characterized by its divergence from traditional democratic transition theories, which typically involve a significant demand for democracy from a politically conscious citizens. Instead, Bhutan&#x27;s democratic system was primarily initiated and driven by the monarchy. In 2006, when the Fourth King, announced his intention to abdicate and conduct parliamentary elections, many Bhutanese citizens expressed their emotional resistance to this change. They argued that the country was already experiencing political stability, peace, and economic progress under the monarchy. The Fourth King justified his decision by stating that democracy should be introduced during times of peace and that it was unwise to rely solely on one individual, especially considering the unknown capabilities of future heirs.

This rationale has led many Bhutanese to view their democracy as unique, often referred to as a “Gift from the Golden Throne.” Jigme Singye Wangchuck has articulated his vision for Bhutanese democracy on multiple occasions. In a speech during the National Assembly session in June 2007, he emphasized that the principles of democracy should permeate all aspects of life—at home, in communities, at work, and within government—indicating that democracy is not merely a political concept but a way of life grounded in individual values and integrity.

==Decentralisation==
At the end of the 4th FYP (1976–1981), Wangchuck extensively reviewed the successes and challenges of the previous four years of development, which also included the physical inspection of the field projects. Wangchuck envisioned different planning system for the 5th FYP (1981–86) emphasising decentralisation. He initiated the creation of the Dzongkhag Yargye Tshogdu (DYT) in 1981 and the Gewog Yargye Tshogchung (GYT) in 1991. These bodies were designed to empower local leaders and facilitate community involvement in governance. The DYT serves as a district development committee, while the GYT operates at the village level. The DYT was a district-level council aimed at promoting people&#x27;s participation in decision-making by formulating, approving, and implementing plans at the district levels whereas GYTs are block-level councils that further decentralized power to local communities. They involve elected representatives like gups and mangmis who oversee development activities within their respective gewogs. As part of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1981-1986), new dzongdags (district heads) were appointed across all 18 districts. They were given broad responsibilities for managing public finances and coordinating district development plans, acting as chairpersons of the DYT. This delegation of authority allowed for more localized decision-making in conjunction with elected local leaders (gups and chimis) The King increasingly devolved authority to local governance structures, enabling them to make decisions that directly affected their communities. This shift aimed to bring governance closer to the people and improve responsiveness to local needs. In 1998, Wangchuck delegated the power of selecting ministers to the National Assembly, reinforcing democratic principles within the monarchy. He retained mechanisms such as the no-confidence vote, ensuring accountability among ministers. Various independent institutions were established during his reign, including subdistrict courts (Dungkhag courts), the Royal Civil Service Commission, and the Election Commission. These institutions laid the groundwork for a more structured governance framework. In 1992, Wangchuck granted autonomy to Bhutan&#x27;s national newspaper, Kuensel, and the national radio network, Bhutan Broadcasting Service (BBS), which had previously been government-controlled. This move promoted greater transparency and freedom of expression. By empowering local bodies and promoting public involvement in decision-making, these reforms contributed to a gradual transition from a centralized monarchy to a constitutional democracy.

==Foreign Policy==
===State Visits ===
Bhutanese participation in international organizations at various levels increased. Personally, Wangchuck attended the non-aligned and SAARC summits until 1997, traveling to Colombo in 1976 for 8th Non-Aligned Summit; Havana in 1979 for 6th Non-Aligned Summit; New Delhi in 1983 for 5th SAARC Summit and 1995 for 8th SAARC Summit; Harare in 1986 for 8th Non-Aligned Summit; Kathmandu in 1987 for 3rd SAARC Summit; Islamabad in 1988 for 4th SAARC Summit; Belgrade in 1989 for 9th Non-Aligned Summit; Malé in 1990 for 5th SAARC Summit, and Dhaka in 1993 for 7th SAARC Summit.

===Diplomatic expansion===
Wangchuck emphasized a two-fold foreign policy for Bhutan: to deepen Bhutan&#x27;s relations with India and to create new bonds of friendship with fellow members of the UN. To diversify the sources of funding, Bhutan cultivated close relationships with the UN, ever since the visit of a UN Under-Secretary-General in 1974. Bhutan became a member of the UN in 1971. Relationships with other nations widened rapidly after 1974. The Coronation of 1974 brought a large number of foreign delegates. As a member of the international comity of nations, the occasion was used to make a debut on the international stage. So, the representatives of the five permanent member countries of the Security Council based in Delhi were invited. Additionally, 19 heads of missions and representatives from international organizations and international press corps attended the coronation. Notably, a representative from China also attended. Bhutan supported China&#x27;s seat in the United Nations in 1971 soon after Bhutan became a member of the UN.
In parallel to the increase in development assistance, the decade between 1980 and 1990 was a period of enhanced diplomacy for Bhutan. In this decade, under the guidance of Wangchuck, Bhutan established diplomatic relations with 17 out of the existing 53 countries, and became associated with 12 out of 20 organizations of the United Nations family.

In Wangchuck&#x27;s reign, diplomatic links were developed with many other nations such as Bangladesh in 1973; Kuwait in 1983; Nepal in 1983; The Maldives in 1984; Denmark in 1985; Norway in 1985; Sweden in 1985; Switzerland in 1985; Netherlands in 1985; Japan in 1986; Finland in 1986; South Korea in 1987; Sri Lanka in 1987; Austria in 1989; Thailand in 1991; Bahrain in 1992; Singapore in 2002; Australia in 2002 and Canada in 2003.
Wangchuck cultivated bonds of friendship with other countries and strengthened Bhutan-international relationships and diversified its sources of development assistance.

==Operation All Clear==
Operation All Clear, initiated on December 15, 2003, targeted several districts in southern Bhutan to remove the presence of two banned insurgent groups from Assam—ULFA and the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB)—as well as the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO), which was active in North Bengal. These groups had set up more than 40 camps, both large and small, in the kingdom over a period starting in 1989.

To flush out the insurgents and restore its control over the area, the Royal Bhutan Army (RBA), personally led by Jigme Singye Wangchuck and his son Jigyel Ugyen Wangchuck, initiated military actions against the camps illegally built by militants in Samtse&#x27;s, Kalikhola sub-district, Sarpang, Nganglam sub-district, Samdrup Jongkhar, Bhagtar sub-district and Daifam sub-district. The RBA operation aimed to destroy camps and seize weapons so that the militants could not re-establish themselves there in the future. Operation All Clear successfully cleared the bases over a period of two days (15–16 December) by combining guerrilla and conventional warfare tactics, which resulted in minimal casualties.

==Popularity Abroad==
In 1989, during the State Funeral of Emperor Hirohito in Tokyo, Bhutan&#x27;s Fourth King, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, displayed extraordinary humility and respect by enduring freezing temperatures in traditional Bhutanese attire and remaining until the ceremony&#x27;s conclusion, earning the admiration of the Japanese people. His simple yet profound gesture created lasting goodwill between Bhutan and Japan, raising awareness about Bhutan and endearing him to the Japanese nation.

In another instance, after Kuwait&#x27;s financial records were destroyed in the Gulf War in 1990, Bhutan was the first to send detailed documents, despite its limited resources. Touched by King Jigme Singye Wangchuck&#x27;s humility, the Emir of Kuwait gifted him a BMW, which the King redirected for diplomatic use and reciprocated with a handcrafted wooden table. 

==Jubilee==
The silver Jubilee of Jigme Singye Wangchuck was celebrated in 1999. This event provided an opportunity to reflect on the milestones achieved during his reign. The occasion was celebrated nationwide with cultural performances, traditional dances, and public gatherings. A commemorative medal was issued to mark the event.

Wangchuck introduced Gross National Happiness (GNH) as a framework that emphasizes holistic well-being alongside economic development. His leadership was marked by efforts to modernize Bhutan while also aiming to preserve its cultural identity and expand diplomatic relations with various countries, including Japan and Sweden. The Silver Jubilee celebration of his reign prompted discussions about Bhutan&#x27;s history and culture, underscoring the significant developments that occurred during this period. This event is viewed as an important moment in Bhutan&#x27;s history, reflecting the relationship between the monarchy and the populace while acknowledging the ongoing efforts to balance tradition with modernization.

==Abdication==
Wangchuck abdicated the throne in favor of his son in 2006, in preparation for the country&#x27;s transition from an absolute monarchy to a semi-constitutional monarchy. In doing so, he stated: &quot;The best time to change a political system is when the country enjoys stability and peace... Why wait for a revolution? Why crown an heir only when the nation is in mourning for a late king?&quot; Having ruled since 1972, Jigme Singye Wangchuck was known for his efforts to modernize Bhutan while preserving its cultural identity and promoting the concept of Gross National Happiness (GNH). His abdication marked a significant turning point in Bhutanese history, facilitating democratic reforms and a new era of governance in the country.

<text>In population genetics, the founder effect is the loss of genetic variation that occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of individuals from a larger population. It was first fully outlined by Ernst Mayr in 1942, using existing theoretical work by those such as Sewall Wright. As a result of the loss of genetic variation, the new population may be distinctively different, both genotypically and phenotypically, from the parent population from which it is derived. In extreme cases, the founder effect is thought to lead to the speciation and subsequent evolution of new species.

In the figure shown, the original population has nearly equal numbers of blue and red individuals. The three smaller founder populations show that one or the other color may predominate (founder effect), due to random sampling of the original population. A population bottleneck may also cause a founder effect, though it is not strictly a new population.

The founder effect occurs when a small group of migrants—not genetically representative of the population from which they came—establish in a new area. In addition to founder effects, the new population is often very small, so it shows increased sensitivity to genetic drift, an increase in inbreeding, and relatively low genetic variation.

==Founder mutation==
In genetics, a founder mutation is a mutation that appears in the DNA of one or more individuals which are founders of a distinct population. Founder mutations initiate with changes that occur in the DNA and can be passed down to other generations. Any organism—from a simple virus to something complex like a mammal—whose progeny carry its mutation has the potential to express the founder effect, for instance a goat or a human.

Founder mutations originate in long stretches of DNA on a single chromosome; indeed, the original haplotype is the whole chromosome. As the generations progress, the proportion of the haplotype that is common to all carriers of the mutation is shortened (due to genetic recombination). This shortening allows scientists to roughly estimate the age of the mutation.

==General==
The founder effect is a type of genetic drift, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The new colony may have less genetic variation than the original population, and through the random sampling of alleles during reproduction of subsequent generations, continue rapidly towards fixation. The homozygosity increase can be calculated as formula_1, where formula_2 equals inbreeding coefficient and formula_3 equals population size. This consequence of inbreeding makes the colony more vulnerable to extinction.

The per generation loss of heterozygosity can be calculated as formula_4, where formula_5 equals heterozygosity. The population of the founders of the colony can also be calculated if the loss of heterozygosity from the bottleneck is known using the same equation.

When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population&#x27;s genetic makeup far into the future. In humans, who have a slow reproduction rate, the population will remain small for many generations, effectively amplifying the drift effect generation after generation until the population reaches a certain size. The post-bottleneck population growth rate can be calculated as formula_6, where formula_7 equals the number of generations, formula_8 is the growth rate, formula_9 is the population equilibrium size, formula_10 is the natural logarithm base, and formula_11 is the constant formula_12, where formula_13 is the original size of the founding colony.

Alleles which were present but relatively rare in the original population can move to one of two extremes. The most common one is that the allele is soon lost altogether, but the other possibility is that the allele survives and within a few generations has become much more dispersed throughout the population. The new colony can experience an increase in the frequency of recessive alleles, as well, and as a result, an increased number who are homozygous for certain recessive traits. The equation to calculate reccessive allele frequencies is formula_14 based on Hardy-Wienberg assumptions.

The variation in gene frequency between the original population and colony may also trigger the two groups to diverge significantly over the course of many generations. As the variance, or genetic distance, increases, the two separated populations may become distinctively different, both genetically and phenotypically, although not only genetic drift, but also natural selection, gene flow and mutation all contribute to this divergence. This potential for relatively rapid changes in the colony&#x27;s gene frequency led most scientists to consider the founder effect (and by extension, genetic drift) a significant driving force in the evolution of new species. Sewall Wright was the first to attach this significance to random drift and small, newly isolated populations with his shifting balance theory of speciation. Following behind Wright, Ernst Mayr created many persuasive models to show that the decline in genetic variation and small population size accompanying the founder effect were critically important for new species to develop. However, much less support for this view is shown today, since the hypothesis has been tested repeatedly through experimental research, and the results have been equivocal at best. Speciation by genetic drift is a specific case of peripatric speciation which in itself occurs in rare instances. It takes place when a random change in genetic frequency of population favours the survival of a few organisms of the species with rare genes which cause reproductive mutation. These surviving organisms then breed among themselves over a long period of time to create a whole new species whose reproductive systems or behaviors are no longer compatible with the original population. 

==Serial founder effect==
Serial founder effects have occurred when populations migrate over long distances. Such long-distance migrations typically involve relatively rapid movements followed by periods of settlement. The populations in each migration carry only a subset of the genetic diversity carried from previous migrations. As a result, genetic differentiation tends to increase with geographic distance as described by the &quot;isolation by distance&quot; model. The migration of humans out of Africa is characterized by serial founder effects. Africa has the highest degree of human genetic diversity of any continent, which is consistent with an African origin of modern humans.

==In island ecology==
Founder populations are essential to the study of island biogeography and island ecology. A natural &quot;blank slate&quot; is not easily found, but a classic series of studies on founder population effects was done following the catastrophic 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, which erased all life on the island. Another continuing study has been following the biocolonization of Surtsey, Iceland, a new volcanic island that erupted offshore between 1963 and 1967. An earlier event, the Toba eruption in Sumatra about 73,000 years ago, covered some parts of India with of ash, and must have coated the Nicobar Islands and Andaman Islands, much nearer in the ash fallout cone, with life-smothering layers, forcing the restart of their biodiversity.

However, not all founder effect studies are initiated after a natural disaster; some scientists study the reinstatement of a species that became locally extinct or hadn&#x27;t existed there before. A study has been in place since 1958 studying the wolf/moose interaction on Isle Royale in Lake Superior after those animals naturally migrated there, perhaps on winter ice. Hajji and others, and Hundertmark &amp; Van Daele, studied the current population statuses of past founder effects in Corsican red deer and Alaskan elk, respectively. Corsican red deer are still listed as an endangered species, decades after a severe bottleneck. They inhabit the Tyrrhenian islands and surrounding mainlands currently, and before the bottleneck, but Hajji and others wanted to know how the deer originally got to the islands, and from what parent population or species they were derived. Through molecular analysis, they were able to determine a possible lineage, with red deer from the islands of Corsica and Sardinia being the most related to one another. These results are promising, as the island of Corsica was repopulated with red deer from the Sardinian island after the original Corsican red deer population became extinct, and the deer now inhabiting the island of Corsica are diverging from those inhabiting Sardinia.

Kolbe and others set up a pair of genetically sequenced and morphologically examined lizards on seven small islands to watch each new population&#x27;s growth and adaptation to its new environment. Specifically, they were looking at the effects on limb length and perch width, both widely varying phenotypic ranges in the parent population. Unfortunately, immigration did occur, but the founder effect and adaptive differentiation, which could eventually lead to peripatric speciation, were statistically and biologically significant between the island populations after a few years. The authors also point out that although adaptive differentiation is significant, the differences between island populations best reflect the differences between founders and their genetic diversity that has been passed down through the generations.

Founder effects can affect complex traits, such as song diversity. In the Common Myna (&quot;Acridotheres tristis&quot;), the percentage of unique songs within a repertoire and within‐song complexity were significantly lower in birds from founder populations.

It was found by Tarr et al. (1998) that the loss of heterozygosity of the Laysan finch (&quot;Telespiza cantans&quot;) after founding events on small islands in the Pacific Ocean closely matched theoretical calculations upon examination of microsatellite loci.

==Among human populations==
Genetic studies of founder effect have concentrated on discovering ancestral and novel genetic diseases caused by founder effect and, to a lesser degree, on ancestry-related founder effects on populations, races, and ancient migrations, as well other aspects. The founder population could be the common ancestry of race or ethnicity or the forced localizations caused by artificial countries inside the larger group of ancestry, hence causing an original founder effect. Race and specific founder effect mutation diseases are found in all races or ethnicities, and country-specific mutation diseases are caused by increasing homozygosity (the existence of same gene on both chromosomes pairs, hence a recessive disease may increase in just few generations). The genetic abnormality will increase incrementally with the decrease of number of isolated populations making tribe-specific diseases (such as Ashkenazi Jews, Amish, and Bedouins) and novel genetic defects.
In recessive diseases, founder populations where underlying levels of genome-wide homozygosity are high due to shared common ancestry, but also for consanguineous populations that will have large genome-wide homozygous regions due to inbreeding. Having a catalog of disease-associated variation in these populations enables rapid, early, and accurate diagnoses that may improve patient outcomes due to informed clinical management and early interventions. Enclosed communities such as Amish communities, Ashkenazi communities, and relatively isolated islands allow scientists to better understand and further discover the mutated genes that cause these rare diseases and allow them to also discover protective genes as well.

Due to various migrations throughout human history, founder effects are somewhat common among humans in different times and places. The French Canadians of Quebec are a classical example of founder population. Over 150 years of French colonization, between 1608 and 1760, an estimated 8,500 pioneers married and left at least one descendant on the territory. Following the takeover of the colony by the British crown in 1760, immigration from France effectively stopped, but descendants of French settlers continued to grow in number mainly due to their high fertility rate. Intermarriage occurred mostly with the deported Acadians and migrants coming from the British Isles. Since the 20th century, immigration in Quebec and mixing of French Canadians involve people from all over the world. While the French Canadians of Quebec today may be partly of other ancestries, the genetic contribution of the original French founders is predominant, explaining about 90% of regional gene pools, while Acadian (descended from other French settlers in eastern Canada) admixtures contributing 4% British and 2% Native American and other groups contributing less.

In humans, founder effects can arise from cultural isolation, and inevitably, endogamy. For example, the Amish populations in the United States exhibit founder effects because they have grown from a very few founders, have not recruited newcomers, and tend to marry within the community. Though still rare, phenomena such as polydactyly (extra fingers and toes, a symptom of a condition such as Weyers acrodental dysostosis or Ellis–Van Creveld syndrome) are more common in Amish communities than in the American population at large. Maple syrup urine disease affects about one out of 180,000 infants in the general population. Due in part to the founder effect, however, the disease has a much higher prevalence in children of Amish, Mennonite, and Jewish descent. Similarly, a high frequency of fumarase deficiency exists among the 10,000 members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a community which practices both endogamy and polygyny, where an estimated 75–80% of the community are blood relatives of just two men—founders John Y. Barlow and Joseph Smith Jessop. In South Asia, castes like the Gujjars, the Baniyas and the Pattapu Kapu have estimated founder effects about 10 times as strong as those of Finns and Ashkenazi Jews.

In Africa, many members of the Vadoma tribe inherit ectrodactyly, giving them the nickname of the &quot;two-toed tribe&quot;.

The island of Pingelap also suffered a population bottleneck in 1775 following a typhoon that had reduced the population to only 20 people. As a result, complete achromatopsia has a current rate of occurrence of roughly 10%, with an additional 30% being carriers of this recessive condition.

Around 1814, a small group of British colonists founded a settlement on Tristan da Cunha, a group of small islands in the Atlantic Ocean, midway between Africa and South America. One of the early colonists apparently carried a rare, recessive allele for retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive form of blindness that afflicts homozygous individuals. As late as 1961, the majority of the genes in the gene pool on Tristan were still derived from 15 original ancestors; as a consequence of the inbreeding, of 232 people tested in 1961, four were suffering from retinitis pigmentosa. This represents a prevalence of 1 in 58, compared with a worldwide prevalence of around 1 in 4,000.

The abnormally high rate of twin births in Cândido Godói could be explained by the founder effect.

On 31 August 2023, researchers reported, based on genetic studies, that a human ancestor population bottleneck (from a possible 100,000 to 1000 individuals) occurred &quot;around 930,000 and 813,000 years ago ... lasted for about 117,000 years and brought human ancestors close to extinction.&quot;

<text>Georgi Sedefchov Parvanov (, ) (born 28 June 1957) is a Bulgarian historian and politician who was President of Bulgaria from 2002 to 2012. He was elected after defeating incumbent Petar Stoyanov in the second round of the November 2001 presidential election. He took office on 22 January 2002. He was reelected in a landslide victory in 2006, becoming the first Bulgarian president to serve two terms. Parvanov supported Bulgaria&#x27;s entry into NATO and the European Union.

According to Bulgarian law, a Bulgarian president is not allowed to be a member of a political party, thus Parvanov left the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) after his election in 2001. Although he identified as a socialist, Parvanov often called himself a &#x27;social president&#x27;.

After completing his second term as president, Parvanov returned to the Socialist Party, prompting a dispute over the party leadership. In January 2014 Parvanov restarted his Alternative for Bulgarian Revival (ABV) project, announcing he would be fielding his own candidates for the 2014 European parliamentary elections. On 15 January 2017, he stepped down as party leader and was replaced by Konstantin Prodanov.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Georgi Parvanov was born in Sirishtnik, Pernik Province on 28 June 1957 and he grew up in nearby Kosacha. In 1975 Parvanov graduated from secondary school in Pernik and in 1981 finished his undergraduate education at Sofia University, gaining a major in history, specializing in the history of the Bulgarian Communist Party. In 1988 Parvanov defended his doctoral thesis in history, which is titled &quot;Dimitar Blagoev and the Bulgarian national question 1879-1917&quot;.

=== Professional career ===
Parvanov joined the Institute for History of the Bulgarian Communist Party as a researcher in 1981. His main interest was the Bulgarian national issue and the early history of social democracy in Bulgaria. In 1989 he was promoted to a senior research associate.

In May 2001 he became a member of the Internet Society of Bulgaria.

== Political career ==
=== Early political career ===
In 1981 Parvanov joined the Bulgarian Communist Party. In April 1990 the party was transformed into the Bulgarian Socialist Party. In 1989 Parvanov formed the nationalist organization &quot;Nationwide Committee for the Defense of National Interests&quot; (Bulgarian: Общонароден комитет за защита на националните интереси). In 1994 he became Deputy Chairman of the BSP national Council. It was also in that year that he was elected to the National Assembly; he was reelected in 1997 and 2001. Parvanov was chairman of the Parliamentary Group for Friendship with Greece and member of the Parliamentary Committee on Radio and Television from 1994 to 1997.

=== Leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party ===
Because of a severe financial crisis, the Prime Minister and leader of the BSP, Zhan Videnov, resigned in December 1996. Georgi Parvanov was elected as his successor that month. However, after large protests against the socialist government in January 1997, Parvanov and Nikolay Dobrev (the nominated Prime Minister) returned the mandate to form a government. In the early parliamentary elections that ensued, the Socialist Party went into opposition, swept away by the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS).

In 2000 Parvanov was reelected as Chairman of the National Council of the BSP. He has been credited with altering the geopolitical orientation of the party, paving the way for Bulgaria&#x27;s joining of NATO in 2004.

Parvanov led his party to its worst electoral performance in 2001. Both the BSP and the SDS suffered greatly from the rise of the newly founded National Movement for Simeon II.

=== 2001 presidential election ===

In the first round of the 2001 presidential election, Parvanov won 36.4% of the votes, finishing ahead of the incumbent SDS candidate, Petar Stoyanov, who polled 34.9% of the votes. The voter turnout was the lowest to date: only 41.8%. Parvanov emerged victorious in the runoff, winning 54.1% of the votes. Voter turnout was significantly higher in the second round: 55.1%. Following his victory, Sergei Stanishev took over the party leadership. Parvanov took office on 22 January 2002, becoming the first ex-Communist to win the presidency since 1990.

=== 2006 presidential election ===

In 2006 he ran for re-election. He was backed by the ruling triple coalition, who won 70% of the seats in parliament the year before. He won first round on 22 October with 64 per cent of the vote. Because the turnout was less than 50%, he faced the nationalist Volen Siderov at the runoff on 29 October. Parvanov won with 76 per cent of the vote. This made Parvanov the first President to be reelected in Bulgaria.

=== Second mandate ===


In the second mandate of Georgi Parvanov as a President of Bulgaria, two governments changed: that of Sergei Stanishev and the current one of Boiko Borisov. As for the government of Stanishev Parvanov is often accused of not taking position about important matters, the critics even made Parvanov admit he actually proposed resignation of Stanishev as a PM before the end of Stanishev government&#x27;s mandate in order that the Socialist Party has more chances in the following parliamentary elections. At the beginning of the First Borisov Government, Parvanov faced regular argues with Finance Minister Simeon Djankov and later with Minister of Defence Aniu Anev, and indirectly with Minister of Education Sergei Ignatov. Arguments and tapes send to media reached such point that a proposal for impeachment reached in Bulgarian Parliament which had enough signed representers but in the last moment was not voted by the RZS party and thus failed parliamentary approval. Following the attempt for impeachment Parvanov quickly gained back his personal authority.

==== ABV (АБВ) ====
In summer 2010, Parvanov reached his platform ABV (Bulgarian: АБВ), the name constructed by the first three letters in Bulgarian alphabet, which he claimed was neither a political party nor a preparation for registering such. However, he visited many cities and had meetings with mayors which was a sign that some interpreted as a preparation for regional and further parliamentary elections. With the coming-out of the first sociological researches, it became clear ABV would not reach enough votes in the next elections and Parvanov moved his sight back to his party BSP. It was also suggested that ABV will move as a part of BSP at some point. While in 2013 virtually no media mentioned ABV in any context, in January 2014 Parvanov made what some media called &quot;a disappointing attempt to restart the project&quot;, and others referred to ABV as an &quot;officially frozen project&quot;.

=== Political stances ===
Although the office of the Bulgarian President is largely representative and executive power lies within the government, Georgi Parvanov has played an active political role. His political views, for example in the context of the Kosovo War, have been described as pro-Russian.

==Criticisms==
=== Collaboration with Committee for State Security ===
In 2006 Parvanov admitted that before 1989 there was a file on him at the Communist Security Service (&quot;Darzhavna Sigurnost&quot;, or DS) under the nickname &quot;Gotse&quot; (for the revolutionary Gotse Delchev) for his scientific assistance on Macedonian topics. The file like most other files of the Security Service hasn&#x27;t been released to the public for a while (it is now available online). According to Parvanov&#x27;s own statement, the file only shows that he had been consulted as a historian in conjunction with the writing of a memoir book about events related to the Macedonian Question in the 19th century. That was confirmed by two members of parliamentary commissions that had examined the files of the Security Service earlier — Bogomil Bonev and Veselin Angelov. Two other members, Metodi Andreev and Evgeni Dimitrov, accused the former of lying and asserted that the historical research had only been a prelude, followed by Parvanov&#x27;s consent to work as an agent and write a report about his institute.

=== Iraq Oil for Food program (1998) ===
The report of the Special Commission of the United Nations into the misconduct of the Iraqi &quot;Oil for food&quot; suggests that in 1998 Saddam Hussein took bribes from the Bulgarian Socialist Party, then led by Parvanov and companies close to the party. Parvanov denied these allegations explaining that the party&#x27;s financing was transparent and legitimate. No further evidence to support these claims was found.

== Other ==
===Bulgarian Christmas Charity Campaign (2003–present) ===
Georgi Parvanov initiated the &quot;Bulgarian Christmas&quot; campaign, a funds raised for the treatment of children and renovation of hospitals and health institutions. Bulgarian Christmas is a musical event each year at the time of Christmas in which Bulgarian performers sing their most popular songs in the audience of the President and his wife, and other VIP guests. The event is TV-broadcast on the national channel BNT and funds are being raised by donations through SMS and bank transfers.

Over the years, millions of euro have been donated by private individuals such as Igor Parvanov and foreign companies, and Parvanov as closely related to the campaign warrants that the money be spent as prescribed.
==Family==
Parvanov has two children with his wife, Zorka Parvanova: Vladimir and Ivaylo. Parvanov has two grandchildren from his son Vladimir: Georgi (born 2011) and Victoria (born 2015).

He succeeded Pierre Buyoya, as president on 30 April 2003, after serving as Buyoya&#x27;s vice president for 18 months. Ndayizeye remained in office until succeeded by Pierre Nkurunziza on 26 August 2005.

In 1994 he was appointed director of the National Intelligence Service by President Cyprien Ntaryamira.

In 2004, Ndayizeye proposed a draft constitution to the parliament prior to it being put to the electorate in referendum later in the year. Relations with the Tutsi group were strained, reflected in their boycotting of the legislative session due to consider the proposal. Due to a lack of preparation, the ballot was postponed to late November 2004.

Burundi is still trying to emerge from a civil war that began in 1993 when several groups drawn from the large Hutu majority took up arms against a government and army then dominated by a Tutsi elite.

The interim government pledged to more equitably share power between the two main ethnic groups.

On 21 August 2006, Ndayizeye was arrested in Bujumbura in relation to his alleged role in a coup plot earlier in the year. The Senate lifted his immunity as Senator prior to his arrest. He denied the charges against him in court on December 19 and said that he had &quot;never dreamed of organising a coup, in fact I had given up politics to do business and be with my family&quot;. On January 15, 2007, he was acquitted along with former vice president Alphonse-Marie Kadege and three other defendants; two others were sentenced to long prison terms.

During 2010 general elections, as his party representative, he ran for the presidential seat but decided to withdraw from the race together with all opposition parties, after they accused the ruling party of rigging previous councilors&#x27; elections.

After opposition politician Zedi Feruzi was killed during the 2015 Burundian unrest Ndayizeye and other opposition parties broke off talks with the government of President Pierre Nkurunziza.

<text>Order No. 227 () was an order issued on 28 July 1942 by Joseph Stalin, who was acting as the People&#x27;s Commissar of Defence. It is known for its line &quot;Not a step back!&quot; (, &quot;Ni shagu nazad!&quot;), which became the primary slogan of the Soviet press in summer 1942.

Order No. 227 established that each front must create one to three penal battalions (, commonly known as ) of up to 800 middle-ranking commanders and high-ranking commanders accused of disciplinary problems, which were sent to the most dangerous sections of the front lines. From 1942 to 1945, a total of 422,700 Red Army personnel were sentenced to penal battalions as a result of courts-martial. The order also directed that each army must create &quot;blocking detachments&quot; at the rear that would shoot &quot;panic-mongers and cowards&quot;. In the first three months, blocking detachments shot 1,000 penal troops and sent 24,000 to penal battalions. By October 1942, the idea of regular blocking detachments was unofficially dropped.

Intended to galvanise the morale of the hard-pressed Red Army and emphasize patriotism, it had a generally detrimental effect and was not consistently implemented by commanders who viewed diverting troops to create blocking detachments as a waste of manpower. On 29 October 1944, blocking detachments were officially disbanded by Stalin&#x27;s order No. 349 citing the changed situation at the front.

==History==
During the first part of the war on the Eastern Front, the Soviets suffered heavy losses along with mass retreat and desertion. Stalin released order No. 227 intending to re-establish discipline in the Red Army in the battle against the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS:
It goes on to state that The Supreme General Headquarters of the Red Army commands:

==Effect==
Marshal of the Soviet Union, Aleksandr Vasilevsky, wrote: &quot;...Order N 227 is one of the most powerful documents of the war years due to its patriotic and emotional content... the document was motivated by rough and dark times... while reading it we were thinking to ourselves if we were doing everything it takes to win the battle.&quot;

Each front had to create penal companies for privates and NCOs. By the end of 1942, there were 24,993 troops serving in penal battalions, which increased to 177,694 in 1943. The number decreased over the next two years to 143,457 and 81,766 soldiers in 1944 and 1945, respectively. The total of Red Army personnel sentenced by courts-martial was 994,300, with 422,700 assigned to penal battalions and 436,600 imprisoned after sentencing. Not included are 212,400 deserters, who were not found and escaped the custody of the military districts.

In the first three months, blocking detachments shot 1,000 penal troops and sent 24,000 to penal battalions. According to an internal list of the NKVD from October 1942, 15,649 soldiers were picked up by the restricted forces who fled the front line on the Stalingrad Front from August 1, 1942, to October 15, 1942. Of these, 244 soldiers were imprisoned, 278 were shot, 218 were sent to penal companies, 42 to penal battalions and 14,833 to return to their units. By October 1942, the idea of regular blocking detachments was unofficially dropped.

<doc id="392319" wikidata="Q57272" url="?curid=392319" title="Paul Biya">
<text>Paul Biya (born Paul Barthélemy Biya&#x27;a bi Mvondo, 13 February 1933) is a Cameroonian politician and dictator who has been serving as the second president of Cameroon since 1982. He was previously the fifth prime minister under President Ahmadou Ahidjo from 1975 to 1982. As of 2025, he is the second-longest-ruling president in Africa (after Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo in Equatorial Guinea) and the longest consecutively serving current non-royal national leader in the world and the oldest head of state in the world. 

A native of Cameroon&#x27;s south, Biya rose rapidly as a bureaucrat under President Ahmadou Ahidjo in the 1960s, as Secretary-General of the Presidency from 1968 to 1975 and then as prime minister. He succeeded Ahidjo as president upon the latter&#x27;s surprise resignation in 1982 and consolidated power in a 1983–1984 staged attempted coup in which he eliminated all of his major rivals.

Biya introduced political reforms within the context of a one-party system in the 1980s, later accepting the introduction of multiparty politics in the early 1990s under serious pressure. He won the contentious 1992 presidential election with 40% of the plurality, single-ballot vote and was re-elected by large margins in 1997, 2004, 2011, and 2018. Opposition politicians and Western governments have alleged voting irregularities and fraud on each of these occasions. Multiple sources have provided evidence that he did not win the elections in 1992 and the political opposition along with others have alleged subsequent elections suffered from rampant fraud.

==Early life and education==
Ethnically Beti, Paul Biya was born in the village of Mvomeka&#x27;a in what is now the South Region of Cameroon. He studied at the Lycée General Leclerc, Yaoundé, and in France at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, Paris, going on to the Institut des hautes études d&#x27;Outre-Mer, where he graduated in 1961 with a higher education diploma in public law.

==Presidency: 1982–present==
===Rise to prominence and forward===
As a Chargé de Mission in post-independence 1960s Cameroon, Biya rose to prominence under President Ahmadou Ahidjo. After becoming director of the Cabinet of the minister of national education in January 1964 and secretary-general of the ministry of national education in July 1965, he was named director of the civil cabinet of the president in December 1967 and secretary-general of the presidency (while remaining director of the civil cabinet) in January 1968. He gained the rank of minister in August 1968 and the rank of minister of state in June 1970, while remaining secretary-general of the presidency. Following the creation of a unitary state in 1972, he became Prime Minister of Cameroon on 30 June 1975. In June 1979, a new law designated the prime minister as the president&#x27;s constitutional successor. Ahidjo unexpectedly announced his resignation on 4 November 1982, and Biya accordingly succeeded him as president of Cameroon on 6 November.

Because Biya is a Catholic from the southern region of Cameroon, it was considered surprising that he was chosen by Ahidjo, a Muslim from the north, as his successor. Biya&#x27;s father, who was a catechist, wanted him to join the clergy, but at the age of 16, while in Catholic school, he was expelled. After Biya became president, Ahidjo initially remained head of the ruling Cameroon National Union (CNU/ UNC). Biya was brought into the CNU Central Committee and Political Bureau and was elected as the vice-president of the CNU. On 11 December 1982, he was placed in charge of managing party affairs in Ahidjo&#x27;s absence. During the first months after Biya&#x27;s succession, he continued to show loyalty to Ahidjo, and Ahidjo continued to show support for Biya, but in 1983, a deep rift developed between the two. Ahidjo went into exile in France, and from there, he publicly accused Biya of abuse of power and paranoia about plots against him. After Ahidjo resigned as CNU leader, Biya took the helm of the party at an &quot;extraordinary session&quot; of the CNU party held on 14 September 1983.
In November 1983, Biya announced that the next presidential election would be held on 14 January 1984; it had been previously scheduled for 1985. He was the sole candidate in this election and won 99.98% of the vote. In February 1984, Ahidjo was put on trial &quot;in absentia&quot; for alleged involvement in a 1983 coup plot, along with two others; they were sentenced to death, although Biya commuted their sentences to life in prison. Biya survived a military coup attempt on 6 April 1984, following his decision on the previous day to disband the Republican Guard and disperse its members across the military. Estimates of the death toll ranged from 71 (according to the government) to about 1,000. Northern Muslims were the primary participants in this coup attempt, which was seen by many as an attempt to restore that group&#x27;s supremacy. Biya, however, chose to emphasize national unity and did not focus blame on northern Muslims. Ahidjo was widely believed to have orchestrated the coup attempt, and Biya is thought to have learned of the plot in advance and to have disbanded the Republican Guard in response, forcing the coup plotters to act earlier than they had planned, which may have been a crucial factor in the coup&#x27;s failure.Under his rule, the country adopted a structural adjustment plan submitted to it by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, which involved privatization, opening up to competition, and reducing social spending. Civil servants&#x27; salaries were reduced by 60%, and the informal sector increased very significantly.

In 1985, the CNU was transformed into the Cameroon People&#x27;s Democratic Movement, in Bamenda and Biya was unlawfully elected as its president. He was also re-elected as President of Cameroon on 24 April 1988.
Biya initially took some steps to open up the regime, culminating in the decision to legalize opposition parties in 1990. According to official results, Biya won the first multiparty presidential election, held on 11 October 1992, with about 40% of the vote. There was no provision for a runoff; the opposition was unable to unite around a single candidate. The second placed candidate, John Fru Ndi of the opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF), officially received about 36%. The results were strongly disputed by the opposition, which alleged fraud.

In the October 1997 presidential election, which was boycotted by the main opposition parties, Biya was re-elected with 92.6 percent of the vote; he was sworn in on 3 November.

He has been consistently re-elected as the National President of the RDPC; he was re-elected at the party&#x27;s second extraordinary congress on 7 July 2001 and its third extraordinary congress on 21 July 2006.

Biya won another seven-year term in the 11 October 2004 presidential election, officially taking 70.92 percent of the vote, although the opposition again alleged widespread fraud. Biya was sworn in on 3 November.

After being re-elected in 2004, Biya was barred by a two-term limit in the 1996 Constitution from running for president again in 2011; however, he sought to revise this, to allow him to run again. In his 2008 New Year&#x27;s message, Biya expressed support for revising the Constitution, saying that it was undemocratic to limit the people&#x27;s choice. The proposed removal of term limits was among the grievances expressed during violent protests in late February 2008. Nevertheless, on 10 April 2008, the National Assembly voted to change the Constitution to remove term limits. Given the RDPC&#x27;s control of the National Assembly, the change was overwhelmingly approved, with 157 votes in favor and five opposed; the 15 deputies of the SDF chose to boycott the vote in protest. The change also provided for the President to enjoy immunity from prosecution for his actions as president after leaving office.
On 12 June 2006, he signed the Greentree Agreement with Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo which formally put an end to the Bakassi peninsula border dispute.

In February 2008, riots broke out, calling for lower prices and the departure of Paul Biya as president. The demonstrators were severely repressed with reports of a hundred dead and thousands of arrests.

In the October 2011 presidential election, Biya secured a sixth term in office, polling 77.9% of votes cast. John Fru Ndi was his nearest rival, polling 10%. Biya&#x27;s opponents alleged wide-scale fraud in the election and procedural irregularities were noted by the French and US governments. In his victory speech, Biya promised to stimulate growth and create jobs with a programme of public works which would &quot;transform our country into a vast construction site&quot;. On 3 November 2011, he was sworn in for another term as president.
Biya won the 2018 presidential election with 71.3% of the vote. The election was marred by violence and low voter turnout.

===Foreign relations===
==== France ====
His regime is supported by France, one of the former colonial powers in Cameroon, which supplies it with weapons and trains its military forces. France is also the leading foreign investor in Cameroon.

==== China ====
The People&#x27;s Republic established relations with Cameroon on 26 March 1971. In the 2000s, leading politicians paid state visits to and from each country; these included President Biya&#x27;s visit for a conference in 2006 and Hu Jintao&#x27;s visit to Cameroon in 2007.

Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi visited Cameroon on 12 January 2014.

Cameroon was one of 53 countries that, in June 2020, backed the Hong Kong national security law at the United Nations.

==== Israel ====
Cameroon voted against several anti-Israel UN resolutions, and was the only nation to join Israel in voting against the UN resolution &quot;Assistance to Palestine Refugees&quot;.

Cameroon cut ties with Israel from 1973 to 1986 and was one of the first states to restore relations. The government of Cameroon uses Israeli armored vehicles, and Cameroon&#x27;s Rapid Reaction Force, often shortened (by its French name) to BIR, is equipped and trained by Israel.

Students in Cameroon were granted 11 month visas to travel to Israel and learn about agriculture, while poultry farmers underwent training for poultry production in Israel.

Israelis also trained personnel at six hospitals in Cameroon on how to combat the Ebola virus.

==== Nigeria ====
Biya, Ahidjo&#x27;s successor as president, filed suit at the International Court of Justice on 29 March 1994. Cameroon&#x27;s claim to Bakassi was largely based on the Anglo-German agreement of 1913 and the 1975 Maroua Declaration. Nigeria, on the other hand, argued that the peninsula had been the territory of the chiefs of Old Calabar, who had transferred their title to Nigeria upon its independence. As support for this argument it pointed to the Nigerian collection of taxes in the region, the widespread use of Nigerian passports by its residents, and other signs that the Nigerian state had been intimately involved in the governance of the peninsula. On 10 October 2002, after more than eight years of hearings and deliberations, the court ruled in favour of Cameroon, instructing Nigeria to withdraw immediately from the region.

Although Nigeria initially protested the decision, and although it caused significant unrest in Bakassi, Olusegun Obasanjo&#x27;s regime largely cooperated with the ruling. In June 2006, at the Greentree estate in Long Island, New York, the countries signed the Greentree Agreement, which required Nigeria to withdraw its troops from Bakassi by 4 August 2008, and also required Cameroon to protect the rights of the Nigerian citizens who lived in Bakassi. The transfer of the territory to Cameroon proceeded peacefully under the agreement. The Cameroonian government now presents the dispute as a &quot;misunderstanding&quot;, and its resolution as &quot;a model of peaceful conflict resolution in Africa.&quot;

At the request of Biya and Obasanjo, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan established the Cameroon–Nigeria Mixed Commission to negotiate a smooth implementation of the International Court of Justice&#x27;s 2002 ruling. The commission&#x27;s responsibilities included demarcating the entirety of the Cameroon–Nigeria border, facilitating cross-border cooperation and troop withdrawals from Bakassi, and protecting the rights of locals. The commission was chaired by Mohamed Ibn Chambas and had met 38 times by 2015. As of July 2019, 2,001 kilometres of boundary (out of an estimated 2,100 kilometres) had been surveyed and agreed to by both countries, including the border at Bakassi. In May 2007 in Abuja, the commission finalised the maritime boundary, but in 2015, the Cameroonian government reported that &quot;a few tens of kilometres remain[ed] a stumbling block&quot; in finalising the land boundary.

==== United States ====
However, Cameroon–U.S. economic relations were at their highest ever level in 1982, when Ahidjo was replaced by his prime minister, Biya. Between 1982 and 1984, the U.S. overtook France as Cameroon&#x27;s foremost export market, primarily due to its consumption of Cameroonian oil. Biya pursued a diversification of Cameroonian foreign relations still more vigorously than Ahidjo had, describing his foreign policy in such terms as &quot;diplomacy of development&quot;, &quot;co-operation without frontiers&quot;, and &quot;open door&quot; diplomacy. 

From around 2013, bilateral relations increasingly emphasised joint counterterrorism actions against Boko Haram and Islamic State in West Africa, alongside other regional security initiatives, especially in the Gulf of Guinea. Between 2015 and 2020, about 300 U.S. military personnel were deployed in northern Cameroon to conduct regional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.

==Opposition and criticism==

Biya makes relatively few public appearances, and is sometimes characterized as aloof. Since the early 1990s, he has faced his strongest opposition from the Anglophone population of the former Southern Cameroons in the western part of the country.

Although Biya made some efforts to open up the political environment, his regime still retains clear authoritarian characteristics and has largely bucked the trend toward democracy in Africa since the 1990s. Under the constitution, Biya has sweeping executive and legislative powers. He even has considerable authority over the judiciary; the courts can only review a law&#x27;s constitutionality at his request. The RDPC continues to dominate the National Assembly, which does little more than approve his policies.

&quot;Tyrants, the World&#x27;s 20 Worst Living Dictators&quot;, by David Wallechinsky, ranked Biya together with three other leaders in sub-Saharan Africa: Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea, and King Mswati of Swaziland (now Eswatini). He describes Cameroon&#x27;s electoral process in these terms: &quot;Every few years, Biya stages an election to justify his continuing reign, but these elections have no credibility. In fact, Biya is credited with a creative innovation in the world of phony elections. In 2004, annoyed by the criticisms of international vote-monitoring groups, he paid for his own set of international observers, six ex-U.S. congressmen, who certified his election as free and fair.&quot; In a 2005 interview William Quantrill, a retired member of the British Diplomatic Service, argued that the reluctance of Biya to delegate responsibility seriously hampered the quality of governance, with trivial decisions often delayed until he got round to delivering them, and that there was too much government interference in the economy in general.

Biya regularly spends extended periods of time in Switzerland at the Hotel InterContinental Geneva where the former director Herbert Schott reportedly said he comes to work without being disturbed. These extended stays away from Cameroon – while sometimes as short as two weeks and sometimes as long as three months – are almost always referred to as &quot;short stays&quot; in the state-owned press and other media. In February 2008, he passed a bill that allows for having an additional term in office as president which was followed by civil unrests throughout the country. The main violent riots took place in the Western, English-speaking part of the country starting with a &quot;strike&quot; initiated by taxi drivers in Douala, allegedly causing more than 200 casualties in the end. In 2009, his holiday in France allegedly cost $40,000 a day spent on 43 hotel rooms.In 2009, Biya was ranked 19th in &quot;Parade Magazine&#x27;s&quot; Top 20 list of &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Dictators&quot;.

In November 2010, Bertrand Teyou published a book titled &quot;La belle de la république bananière: Chantal Biya, de la rue au palais&quot; (English: &quot;The beauty of the banana republic: Chantal Biya, from the streets to the palace&quot;), tracing Chantal Biya&#x27;s rise from humble origins to become Paul Biya&#x27;s First Lady. He was subsequently given a two-year prison term on charges of &quot;insult to character&quot; and organizing an &quot;illegal demonstration&quot; for attempting to hold a public reading. Amnesty International and International PEN&#x27;s Writers in Prison Committee both protested his arrest and issued appeals on his behalf; Amnesty International also named him a prisoner of conscience. He was freed on 2 May 2011 when the London chapter of International PEN agreed to pay his fine in order that he might seek treatment for his worsening health condition.

In February 2014, French citizen Michel Thierry Atangana was released from a makeshift Yaoundé prison where, under Biya&#x27;s orders, he had been arbitrarily detained for 17 years under false claims of embezzlement because of supposed closeness to presidential candidate Titus Edzoa. Considered a political prisoner and prisoner of conscience by the United States Department of State, Amnesty International, Freedom House, and the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention since 2005, Michel was released under Biya&#x27;s personal decree but the Working Group&#x27;s tripartite demands remain unfulfilled.

In 2016, Cameroonians in the nation&#x27;s capital city of Yaoundé criticized Biya&#x27;s reaction to the country&#x27;s worst train crash in which 79 people died. Critics included government officials who remained anonymous, fearing a backlash. The Anglophone protests in late 2016 were led by English-speaking lawyers in protest against the use of French in Cameroonian courts, which led to violent clashes with police. Opposition party leader Edna Njilin of the Cameroon People&#x27;s Party spoke out against the enforced use of French in the classroom. In January 2017, the government ordered a suspension of Internet services in the Northwest and Southwest provinces. Criticism of the suspension and increased opposition led to resumption of services in late April.

By June 2017, protests in Cameroon&#x27;s English-speaking provinces and cities led to police responding with force, with four protesters killed and more than 100 arrested. International criticism has been levied at the United States for their lack of response to the growing Cameroonian crisis.

In April 2017, a Cameroonian journalist working for Radio France Internationale, Ahmed Abba, was sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment by a military tribunal for failing to report acts of terrorism. The judgement was severely criticized by human rights groups including Amnesty International.

On 7 November 2018, another Cameroonian journalist, Mimi Mefo, was arrested after reporting on social media that the Cameroonian military was behind the murder of an American missionary in the country, Charles Trumann, in October of that year. Mefo was charged with &quot;publishing and propagating information that infringes on the territorial integrity of the Republic of Cameroon,&quot; but was released and charges were dropped on 12 November after her arrest was condemned by both local and international media groups.

In March 2024, the NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) denounced “intense repression” by the Cameroonian government against the opposition, after the government of Paul Biya declared the grouping of its main parties in two platforms “illegal”.

=== Anglophone Cameroon ===


During 2016 and 2017, under Paul Biya&#x27;s reign, large scale protests broke out among Anglophone Cameroonians in the area of the formerly British Southern Cameroons. Protestors complained that Anglophone regions in Cameroon (the Northwest Region and the Southwest Region) were neglected by Biya&#x27;s government, and excluded from power. During this time, Anglophone separatists claim that government forces murdered protestors en masse, and committed crimes against humanity, including genocide. Certain protestors had called upon Biya and the Cameroonian government to grant them independence.

Eventually, separatists declared independence in October 2017 under the name Ambazonia. Numerous civilians and activists have accused Biya&#x27;s government forces of burning villages, raping women, extrajudicial killings of civilians, and acts of genocide. A petition to the United Nations gave details of police raping students at a university. The National Commission for Human Rights and Freedoms embarked on a fact-finding mission in Buea to investigate allegations of human rights abuses in the region.

A June 2018 report by the BBC News found a widespread pattern of villages throughout the Southwest Region being burnt, including one video of men wearing government-issued BIR (Bataillon d&#x27;Intervention Rapide) equipment. The BIR is a special force body that reports directly to President Biya. The report also included a video of a man being tortured by men appearing to be Cameroonian gendarmes. Biya&#x27;s Minister of Communication, Issa Tchiroma, responded by stating that anyone can use government equipment to commit false flag attacks, and said that Biya&#x27;s government would investigate.

Individual sources testify that all of those sent to fight the secessionist militia are French speaking, thus widening the linguistic division between local residents.

On 14 November 2019, Biya admitted in a Paris forum of trying to assimilate former British Southern Cameroons into the majority Francophone system, formerly East Cameroon State but failed, due to identity differences, thus triggering the conflict.

== Personal life ==
Biya became a naturalized citizen of France when he studied there, but he later relinquished his French citizenship when he returned to Cameroon to serve in government positions.

In 1961, he married Jeanne-Irène Biya, who did not have any children, though she adopted Franck Biya, who had been born in 1971 from a relationship between Biya and Jeanne-Irène&#x27;s sister or niece. Franck Biya is seen as a possible successor of his father in the context of presidential elections scheduled for 2025.

Jeanne-Irène Biya died on 29 July 1992 after a short illness while Paul Biya was attending a conference abroad. Rumors have it that she and several people close to her did not die of natural causes.

Paul Biya married Chantal Vigouroux, who is 36 years his junior, on 23 April 1994, and has two more children with her: Paul Jr and Brenda Biya.

Brenda Biya, who is also a LGBTQ activist, publicly revealed her same-sex relationship with Brazilian model Layyons Valença on 5 July 2024. She later stated that she hoped the post would change anti-LGBT laws in Cameroon. However, she deleted the post and broke up with Valença after explicit photographs of them were released without her consent on the Internet. She reportedly accused Valença of sharing the photographs &quot;for the attention of social media followers and even extort money&quot; on TikTok.

Biya is a Rosicrucian, and was likely part of the Rosicrucian organization CIRCES, led by the French esotericist Raymond Bernard. Bernard was also his personal advisor; Biya gave him an allowance of several million francs, and gave the organization itself 40 million francs for Bernard&#x27;s services.

===Health===
As of 2024, he is the longest serving non-royal head of state, having been in power since 30 June 1975. Due to his advanced age, there has been ongoing speculation about his health and potential succession. In October 2024, the government dismissed rumors of his death after his absence from public events since the previous month raised concerns. Officials clarified that he was in Geneva and in good health. On 9 October, the Minister of Territorial Administration Paul Atanga Nji banned media outlets in the country from discussing the president&#x27;s health. On 21 October, Biya was shown on state television arriving at Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport following his return from Switzerland.

<text>Pedro de Verona Rodrigues Pires (; born 29 April 1934) is a Cape Verdean politician who served as Prime Minister of Cape Verde from 1975 to 1991, and later as president from 2001 to 2011.

==Life and career==
Pires was born in São Filipe, Fogo, Cape Verde to Luís Rodrigues Pires and wife Maria Fidalga Lopes. Later, he studied at Liceu Gil Eanes (Old High School) and Escola Jorge Barbosa in Mindelo during the 1950s and later abroad at the University of Lisbon in Portugal at the Faculty of Sciences. He fled to Conakry in 1962, then Ghana and afterwards headed to Algeria; he was trained in Cuba, the Soviet Union and Guinea-Bissau. He attended the Second PAIGC Congress in 1973. Before independence, he returned to Praia, Cape Verde on a Portuguese military ship on October 13, 1974.

===Prime minister===
Three days after the country became independent in 1975, he became the first prime minister of Cape Verde; the nation at the time was a one-party state under the rule of the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAICV). He opposed apartheid in South Africa and opposed foreign intervention in Africa. On October 20–22, 1980, he visited Paris. He visited that city again in 1989 and met with French prime minister Michel Rocard on 11 May 1989. He held additional portfolio of Minister of Finance from 1986 to 1990.

After the ruling PAICV decided to institute multiparty democracy in February 1990, Pires replaced President Aristides Pereira as General Secretary of PAICV in August 1990. The PAICV lost the multiparty parliamentary and presidential elections held in early 1991 and was left in opposition.

===After being Prime Minister===
At a party congress in August 1993, Pires was replaced as General Secretary by Aristides Lima and was instead elected as President of PAICV. As a candidate for the party presidency at PAICV&#x27;s September 1997 congress, he faced José Maria Neves and prevailed with 68% of the vote. He stepped down as PAICV President in 2000 in preparation for a presidential bid in the next year&#x27;s election and he was succeeded by Neves. He officially announced his candidacy for the Presidency of Cape Verde on September 5, 2000.

Pires was the PAICV candidate in the February 2001 presidential election, defeating former prime minister Carlos Veiga of the Movement for Democracy (MpD) in the second round by just 12 votes. Pires took office on March 22; the MpD boycotted his inauguration, saying that the election was marred by a &quot;non-transparent process&quot;. As president, Pires appointed Neves as prime minister.

===As president===
On April 22, 2002, Pires was received the Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry of Portugal.

On June 7, 2005, the president paid hommage to Sergio Frusoni and declared him one of the Greatest Crioulo poets.

Days later on 16 and 17 June, he met and talked with the French Minister of Cooperation Brigitte Girardin in Praia for discussions with the Europe Union for obtaining special status, fight against insecurity.

<text>Abel Pacheco de la Espriella ( ; born 22 December 1933) is a Costa Rican politician who was president of Costa Rica between 2002 and 2006, representing the Social Christian Unity Party &quot;(Partido Unidad Social Cristiana&quot; – PUSC). He ran on a platform to continue free market reforms and to institute an austerity program, and was elected, in a second electoral round, with 58% of the vote in April 2002.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Abel Pacheco and his first wife, Elsa María Muñoz Batha, had five children: Abel, Elsa, Yolanda, Sergio and Valeria. Pacheco married his second wife, Leila Rodríguez Stahl, a former Miss Costa Rica winner, on 20 November 1975. He and Rodríguez had one son, Fabian.

===Career===
Pacheco is a medical doctor who graduated from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México with a degree in Psychiatry from Louisiana State University.

During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s Pacheco was a popular presenter of short programmes on Costa Rican television. During this time he continued to teach at the University of Costa Rica and personally attended to customers at the gentleman&#x27;s outfitters, &quot; El Palacio del Pantalón&quot;, that he had established in downtown San José in the mid-1980s. He also wrote a series of novels and a number of popular songs.

On 1 February 1998 he was elected to serve as a party-list deputy in Costa Rica&#x27;s unicameral Legislative Assembly, representing the province of San José for the PUSC.

In the run-up to the 2002 presidential election, the PUSC party convention selected him to be its candidate by an overwhelming 76% of the delegates&#x27; votes on 10 June 2001. His candidacy was seen as a victory for the rank-and-file members over the party&#x27;s entrenched hierarchy.

In the first round of the election Pacheco received 38.6% of the vote: just short of the 40% needed to avoid a run-off. On 7 April 2002, in the second round – the first time the mechanism had been used since the rules were introduced – Pacheco got 58% of the vote, beating Rolando Araya of the social democratic PLN by a narrow margin.

==Books==
Pacheco is the author of a number of books, including both, fiction and non-fiction. Among other titles of the books that he penned are: Paso de tropa (1969), and Más abajo de la piel (1972).
His work has been translated to more than 20 different languages, given its importance to Costa Rican cultural heritage.

Abel Pacheco was awarded with the prize &quot; Citizen of the World&quot; for his valuable contribution to culture and literature around the world.

== Honours ==

=== Foreign honours ===
** Two Sicilian Royal Family: Knight Grand Cross of Merit of the Two Sicilian Royal Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George
* : Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint-Charles (21 November 2003) 
* Pacheco has received several international awards for his literature work.
* Citizen of the World international award, given to exemplary citizens that have had a major contribution to the culture and arts in the world.

<doc id="392337" wikidata="Q515602" url="?curid=392337" title="Azali Assoumani">
<text>Azali Assoumani (; born 1 January 1959) is a Comorian politician and military officer who has served as the President of the Comoros from 2002 to 2006 and again since 2016, except for a brief period in 2019. He became head of state after staging a coup d&#x27;état in 1999 and was elected president in 2002, 2016, 2019 and 2024. He also served as Chairperson of the African Union from February 2023 to February 2024. Assoumani&#x27;s current presidency has been described as increasingly authoritarian.

== Early life ==
Born in 1959 in Mitsoudjé, French Comoros, Assoumani trained at the Meknes Royal Military Academy in Morocco and the École de Guerre in Paris.

==Political career==
Assoumani became the President of the Council of State of the Comoros in 1999 after overthrowing interim president Tadjidine Ben Said Massounde in a coup d&#x27;état. His troops justified the coup on the basis of protecting territorial integrity after Massounde had begun negotiations with representatives of the island of Anjouan for greater autonomy or independence. This was despite the fact that an international conference in Antananarivo had resulted in a settlement on the matter between the three islands of the Comoros, although the government of Anjouan had delayed ratifying the agreement.

On 23 December 2001, Assoumani&#x27;s new proposed constitution was adopted by referendum. The constitution established a rotating presidency and granted considerable autonomy to the Comorian islands, each of which gained its own basic law, flag and executive branch of government. It also renamed the country from the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros to the Union of the Comoros and redesigned the national flag to remove its religious inscriptions and become multicolour, as can be seen today.

Assoumani announced elections for 2002, with violent clashes between state forces and the opposition erupting across the country during the campaign. Reports of arbitrary arrests also emerged. Assoumani resigned from his position as President of the Council of State on 21 January 2002, in order to run for President of the Union of the Comoros and was succeeded by Hamada Madi. Assoumani was then elected president with 75% of the vote in the multiparty 2002 Comorian presidential election, and was inaugurated on 26 May 2002.

Assoumani&#x27;s presidency was marked by conflicts over jurisdiction and political gridlock due to his refusal to devolve power to the autonomous regions of the Comoros, as mandated by the constitution. The latter also required that successive presidents be from different islands, allowing Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi from Anjouan to succeed him after winning the 2006 presidential election.

Assoumani launched a second presidential bid in the 2016 presidential election. In the first round on 21 February, he came third with 14.96% of the vote, before winning the second round with 40.98% of the vote on 10 April. However, both Assoumani and his opponent Mohamed Ali Solihi disputed the election result, alleging irregularities and electoral fraud in the second round. Assoumani demanded the invalidation of ballots from most of the polling stations on Anjouan in particular. Consequently, a third round of voting took place on 11 May. The Constitutional Court declared Assoumani the winner with 41.43% of the vote on 15 May, and he took office on 26 May for a five-year term. His first vice-president was Djaffar Ahmed Said, the former attorney-general and director of judicial affairs, who was later replaced by Moustadroine Aboudou from Anjouan and then Abdallah Said Sarouma from Mohéli.

During his tenure, the opposition accused Assoumani of having amended the constitution to remain in power until 2029. In addition, his closing of the Constitutional Court and Anti-Corruption Court caused the European Union to suspend all cooperation with the Comoros in protest.

On 13 February 2019, Assoumani resigned the presidency to campaign for re-election in the 2019 Comorian presidential election on 24 March. He was elected in the first round and assumed office again on 3 April.

Assoumani was reelected for another term as president in the 2024 Comorian presidential election. which was marred by allegations of fraud and post-election violence in Moroni. On 7 August 2024, Assoumani granted extensive powers to his son and presumed successor Nour El Fath, allowing him to intervene at several stages of the government decision-making process.

On 13 September 2024, Assoumani was slightly injured after being stabbed at a funeral in Salimani, outside Moroni. The suspect, who was later identified as a 24-year old soldier named Ahmed Abdou, was arrested but was found dead in his prison cell the next day.

In January 2025, the ruling party of president Azali Assoumani won parliamentary election, taking 28 out of 33 parliamentary seats. The opposition parties rejected the results

== Diplomacy ==
In 2022, Assoumani was invited by President Paul Biya of Cameroon to open the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations at Olembe Stadium, Yaoundé. On 28 September 2022, on the occasion of the state funeral for Shinzo Abe, Japan&#x27;s former prime minister, in Tokyo, Assoumani was one of only seven heads of state who met with Japanese Emperor Naruhito.
In July 2023, Assoumani, also in his capacity as Chairperson of the African Union, attended the 2023 Russia–Africa Summit in St. Petersburg in which Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted to continue efforts to posture Russia as a more attractive ally to African partner states than Western liberal democracies.

<text>The New Jersey Generals were a franchise of the United States Football League (USFL) established in 1982 to begin play in the spring and summer of 1983. The team played three seasons from 1983 to 1985, winning 31 regular season games and losing 25 while going 0–2 in postseason competition. Home games were played at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which was called The Meadowlands for Generals games.

==Uniforms==
Team colors were scarlet, white, royal blue and sunflower gold. The primary logo was a gold five-star general wreath. Team helmets were solid scarlet with the logo decal on each side and a white face-mask. Home uniforms featured red jerseys with white numbers trimmed in royal blue, with numbers on the sleeves and no striping; pants were white with a single wide red stripe trimmed in blue down the sides from hip to knee. Road jerseys were white with red numbers trimmed in blue. The team was the second in the New York metropolitan area to be known as &quot;Generals,&quot; since there was a professional soccer team in the late 1960s known as the New York Generals.

==History==

===1983===

From the beginning, USFL founder David Dixon placed a premium on putting a team in the New York area. Initially, Donald Trump was tapped to own the team. However, he backed out after paying an initial installment on the franchise fee, hoping instead to buy the struggling Baltimore Colts of the NFL. Needing a credible owner with the means to front a team in the nation&#x27;s biggest market, Dixon persuaded Oklahoma oil magnate J. Walter Duncan to step in. Duncan had originally been slated to own the USFL&#x27;s Chicago franchise, as he&#x27;d grown up in Chicago. However, he readily agreed to shift to New York.

Duncan took on former New England Patriots coach Chuck Fairbanks as a minority partner; Duncan knew Fairbanks from his days as head coach at the University of Oklahoma. Fairbanks also served as general manager and head coach. They initially had an uphill battle to get a lease at Giants Stadium, but were able to obtain one on condition that they brand their team as &quot;New Jersey&quot; rather than &quot;New York.&quot; They named the team the &quot;Generals&quot; after the large number of generals based in New Jersey during the Revolutionary War.

The team made a big splash by signing Heisman Trophy-winning underclassman Herschel Walker, a running back from the University of Georgia. While the USFL had followed the NFL&#x27;s lead in banning underclassmen from playing, league officials were certain that this rule would never withstand a court challenge. In an even more ominous development, Walker did not sign a standard player contract. Rather, he agreed to a three-year personal-services contract with Duncan. The contract was valued at $4.2 million—more than double the USFL&#x27;s salary cap of $1.8 million. Nonetheless, the other owners knew having the incumbent Heisman winner in their fold would lend the USFL instant credibility, and allowed the contract to stand.

Despite the signing of Walker, who rushed for 1,812 yards and 17 touchdowns, the Generals finished their inaugural season with a 6–12 record. This was largely due to a porous defense which gave up the third-most points in the league (437) and a feeble passing attack led by ex-New Orleans Saints career backup Bobby Scott.

===1984===
At 66 years old, Duncan soon tired of flying as far as from his home in Oklahoma City to see his team play. Believing that the Generals were far too important to the USFL to have an absentee owner, he decided to sell to a local buyer. After the 1983 season, he found one in Donald Trump, who had initially angled for the franchise in 1982 before backing out.

Trump promptly fired Fairbanks. Seeking a high-profile coach, he initially tried to lure Joe Gibbs of the Washington Redskins. When those talks failed, he turned to legendary Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula. Trump offered him a $5 million contract. Shula was receptive, but insisted on getting a rent-free apartment at Trump Tower. In October 1983, Trump announced that the deal was all but done, but the only snag was Shula&#x27;s insistence on an apartment. A furious Shula broke off talks. Years later, former Dolphins&#x27; running back Larry Csonka, by then an executive with the Jacksonville Bulls, said that he believed Shula would have taken the job, but was angered at being &quot;thrown out to the press&quot; by Trump. After Joe Paterno of Penn State turned him down as well, Trump hired former New York Jets head coach Walt Michaels.

The Generals responded to their poor 1983 showing with an influx of veteran NFL talent for 1984, including wide receiver Tom McConnaughey, quarterback Brian Sipe, defensive back Gary Barbaro, and linebackers Jim LeClair and Bobby Leopold. Both Walker and fullback Maurice Carthon rushed for over 1,000 yards (Walker 1,339; Carthon 1,042) as the Generals went 14–4, defeating the eventual champion Philadelphia Stars twice for that franchise&#x27;s only two losses of the season. The Stars defeated the Generals 28–7 in a first round playoff game.

The 1985 season saw the heralded signing of Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Doug Flutie of Boston College. Despite Flutie&#x27;s inexperience, the Generals traded Sipe to the Jacksonville Bulls to ensure Flutie would start. Flutie struggled at times but played well overall until he suffered a broken collarbone against the Memphis Showboats in the season&#x27;s 15th game, sidelining him for the rest of the season. The 1985 Generals finished 11–7 behind Walker&#x27;s pro-football record 2,411 rushing yards but lost again to the Stars (transplanted to Baltimore) in the first round of the playoffs, 20–17.

===1986===
Almost from the moment he bought the Generals, Trump sought to use them as a vehicle to get an NFL team. To this end, he began advocating moving the USFL from a spring schedule to a fall schedule, directly opposite the NFL. Trump&#x27;s long-term plans called for moving the Generals across the Hudson River to New York, which had not had a team play within its borders since the Jets moved from Shea Stadium in Queens to the Meadowlands after the 1983 season. He intended to have the renamed New York Generals play at Shea until the construction of a new 80,000-seat &quot;Trump Stadium&quot; in Manhattan; the stadium never came to fruition.

In 1984, Trump convinced most of his fellow owners to move to a fall schedule in 1986. He contended that if the USFL were to hold its own against the NFL, it would eventually force a merger with the more established league—in which the owners of any USFL teams included in a merger would see their investment more than double.

The Generals acquired the assets of one of the teams displaced by the vote to move to the fall, the Houston Gamblers, during the extended off-season. This was widely reported as a merger, since the Generals inherited all of the Gamblers&#x27; player contracts—including those of quarterback Jim Kelly and wide receiver Ricky Sanders. Michaels was fired, replaced with former Gamblers coach Jack Pardee, who planned to bring Kelly and the Gamblers&#x27; high-powered run and shoot offense with him. Fans immediately dubbed the Kelly–Walker led Generals as the USFL&#x27;s &quot;Dream Team.&quot; 

However, the revamped Generals never played a down. The 1986 season was cancelled after the USFL won only a nominal one dollar verdict in an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL (which was tripled to three dollars due to it being an antitrust suit); the league folded soon afterward.

Numerous Generals players, including Flutie, Walker, and center Kent Hull went on to productive NFL careers. Flutie also starred in the Canadian Football League; Hull (with Gambler quarterback Kelly) played in four Super Bowls with the Buffalo Bills, and Flutie was the last quarterback to have led the Bills to the NFL playoffs until the 2017 season.

<doc id="392341" wikidata="Q57390" url="?curid=392341" title="Ismaïl Omar Guelleh">
<text>Ismaïl Omar Guelleh (; ; born 27 November 1947) is a Djiboutian politician who has served as the President of Djibouti since 1999, making him one of the longest-serving rulers in Africa. He is often referred to by his initials, IOG.

Guelleh was first elected as President in 1999 as the handpicked successor to his uncle, Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who had ruled Djibouti since independence in 1977. Guelleh was re-elected in 2005, 2011, 2016 and in 2021. The elections were largely boycotted by the opposition amid complaints over widespread irregularities. Guelleh has been characterized as a dictator, and his rule has been criticized by human rights groups and governments, such as the United States. He is, at the international level, a close ally of France.

He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India&#x27;s second-highest civilian award, on 25 January 2019 for his role in the safe evacuation of Indian citizens from Yemen during the country&#x27;s ongoing civil war.

== Early life and political beginnings ==
Guelleh was born in Dire Dawa, Ethiopia, into the politically powerful Mamassan subclan of the Ciise Dir clan of the Somali ethnic group. The father of Ismaïl Omar Guelleh, son of Guelleh Batal, is Omar Guelleh, one of the first native teachers in the 1930s before working, following his father&#x27;s path, on behalf of the Franco-Ethiopian Railway Company (CFE) which built the line connecting Djibouti to Addis Ababa and whose head office was in Dire Dawa. When Guelleh was younger he attended a traditional Islamic school. In 1960, Guelleh migrated to Djibouti before finishing high school. In 1964, at the age of 18, Ismail Omar Guelleh began working in the General Information of the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas, because he spoke Amharic, Somali, Arabic, French, Italian and English.

In 1975, he was suspended from his duties because he was suspected of transmitting information to the independence movement. He then became involved in the African People&#x27;s League for Independence (LPAI) chaired by Hassan Gouled Aptidon, who campaigns for independence. Guelleh was elected into the LPAI’s Central Committee in 1983 and subsequently became the director of a cultural commission in Paris. In 1987, he became a member of the party leadership.

After Djibouti became independent, he became head of the secret police and chief of the cabinet in the government of his uncle Hassan Gouled Aptidon, for whom he also served as chief of staff for more than two decades. He received training from the Somali National Security Service and then from the French Secret Service, and was intended to become his uncle&#x27;s successor. 

In February 1991 he attempted to annex Zeyla in Awdal, Somaliland to Djibouti in the 1991 Zeila incursion during the Somaliland War of Independence, however the Djiboutian-backed United Somali Front was shortly routed from the area by Somali National Movement (SNM) forces.

He became President of Djibouti in 1999.

== Presidency ==
=== Rise to power and first term, 1999 to 2005 ===

Djibouti is one of four countries in Africa that have experienced instances of immediate successions from one family member to another.

On 4 February 1999, President Gouled Aptidon, uncle of Ismail Guelleh, announced his retirement at the time of the next election, and an extraordinary congress of his party, the ruling People&#x27;s Rally for Progress (RPP), chose Guelleh as its presidential candidate, handpicked by Aptidon. As the joint candidate of the RPP and moderate wing of the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (FRUD), Guelleh won the presidential election held on 9 April 1999 with 74.02% of the vote, defeating his only challenger, the independent candidate Moussa Ahmed Idriss. He took office on 8 May. Moussa Ahmed Idriss was arrested the following September for &quot;threatening the morale of the armed forces&quot; and detained at an undisclosed location.

In December 2000, Guelleh sacked the chief of staff of the National Police Force, Yacin Yabeh, prompting policemen loyal to Yabeh to unsuccessfully rebel following his dismissal. Guelleh is credited with brokering a permanent peace agreement that year that brought to an end the country’s post-independence ethnic conflict.

=== Second term, 2005 to 2011 ===

Guelleh was nominated by the RPP as its presidential candidate for a second time on 7 October 2004, at an Extraordinary Congress of the party. He was backed by several other parties and was the only candidate in the presidential election held on 8 April 2005. Brief protests against the elections erupted but were quickly suppressed by police. Without a challenger, Guelleh won 100% of the ballots cast and was sworn in for a second six-year term, which he said would be his last, on 7 May.

However, in 2010, Guelleh persuaded the National Assembly of Djibouti to amend the nation&#x27;s Constitution, allowing him to stand for a third term. This cleared the way for him to place his name on the ballot in Djibouti&#x27;s 2011 election. It also resulted in large protests beginning in 2010 similar to the larger movement for democracy in the Arab countries. The protests were quickly put down, opposition leaders arrested and international observers expelled or arrested.

=== Third term, 2011 to 2016 ===
Opposition parties boycotted the election, leaving only one little-known candidate against him on the ballot. Guelleh won almost 80% of the vote. Human Rights Watch questioned the fairness of the election given that opposition leaders were jailed twice prior to polling. Guelleh again said that he would not run for another term.

Guelleh was also the winner of the 2016 election with about 87% of the popular vote. As in previous elections, the opposition had called for a country-wide boycott and demanded Guelleh conduct &quot;transparent, free, fair and just elections.&quot; Opposition leaders and human rights groups complained of repression and police brutality in the run-up to the polls. After interviewing an opposition leader, a BBC team was arrested and expelled shortly before the vote.

=== Fourth term, 2016 to 2021 ===
He was re-elected for a fifth term in the 2021 landslide election. One opposition candidate, Zakaria Ismail Farah, new to electoral politics, ran in the election, accusing the government of ballot-box stuffing and of barring his delegates from accessing polling stations to monitor the voting process. Other major opposition parties did not run candidates, accusing Guelleh of dictatorship.

=== Fifth term, since 2021 ===
In June 2021, Guelleh made vaccination against COVID-19 compulsory for both citizens and foreign residents.

Throughout that same month, Guelleh reshuffled his diplomatic corps, recalling seven ambassadors and appointing new ones to several countries across the Middle East.

=== Succession ===

Guelleh&#x27;s long-time rule opened questions about his eventual succession, with a trusted, hand-picked candidate chosen from within his inner circle being widely predicted. For a long period, the president&#x27;s son-in-law and minister of health, Djama Elmi Okieh, seemed to be Guelleh&#x27;s designated successor, but after 2018 fell out of favor after an alleged affair with an employee and subsequent divorce. The new favored candidate is Naguib Abdallah Kamil, a son of First Lady Kadra Mahamoud Haid from a previous marriage.

By retaining Djibouti&#x27;s main political players in their respective government positions, Guelleh increased the risk for internal power struggles. , Prime Minister Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed and Finance Minister Ilyas Moussa Dawaleh were considered prime contenders for leadership struggles in the run-up to elections in 2026. Another possible candidate involved in intra-governmental fights for power includes Foreign Minister Mahamoud Ali Youssouf.

== Political assessment ==

=== Governance ===

Throughout his presidency, Guelleh has worked to install members of his family in important political and economic positions. A central role is occupied by his wife, Kadra Mahamoud Haid, who acts as the de facto vice-president, and his two daughters: Haibado, functioning as an important advisor to Guelleh, and Fatouma-Awo, heavily involved in the country’s business activities. His son in law, Djama Elmi Okieh, is the Minister of Health.

One of the President’s half-brothers, Saad Omar Guelleh, is the General Manager of the economically paramount Port of Djibouti, while first cousin Djama Ali Guelleh has been the Director General of state-owned utilities company Electricité de Djibouti (EDD) since 1986, more than a decade before Guelleh came to power.

Owing to this intricate blurring of state functions and the ruling clan, Guelleh has been able to exercise strict control over the country’s political, economic and judiciary affairs, aided by his strong grip on the police, military and other security forces. This has guaranteed that &quot;the Guelleh clan’s domination of all public affairs prevailed.&quot;

A message sent from the US Embassy in Djibouti in 2004 and published on WikiLeaks described Djibouti as &quot;less a country than a commercial city state controlled by one man, Ismail Omar Guelleh.&quot;

In its 2020 country report on Human Rights Practices, the US government identified &quot;unlawful or arbitrary killings&quot;, &quot;cases of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government&quot;, and &quot;arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; serious restrictions on free expression, the press, and the internet, including violence&quot;, among others, as &quot;significant human rights issues&quot; in the country.

=== Closer relations with China ===

Guelleh has made use of his country’s strategic position for years, marked by large infrastructure investments, especially in ports and logistics. Since 2013, Guelleh has pursued closer economic and political relations with China, which coincided with Beijing’s growing strategic interest in the Middle East and Africa through the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative that year.

The ensuing great power competition for the country has increased Djibouti’s scope for maneuver, but China’s influence has also grown over Djibouti, having established a naval base there in 2017 and triggering concerns among Djibouti’s traditional Western allies that Beijing’s authoritarian governance style is encouraging more autocratic behavior on Guelleh’s part as well.

The influx of Chinese investments into the country has furthered Guelleh’s development plan based on the Singapore model. It is often understood as &quot;an authoritarian government delivering national prosperity through rigid planning and a singular focus on economic development at the expense of democracy, human rights, and basic freedoms.&quot; Guelleh has frequently made references to following Singapore’s path in official speeches, hoping to transform Djibouti into the &quot;Singapore of Africa&quot; by capitalizing on the Port of Djibouti’s growing role as a strategically located maritime trading hub.

However, experts regard Djibouti’s continued government corruption and favoring of Chinese investors as a hindrance to that development strategy paying off. For example, in 2012 the Djibouti government sold its Doraleh Container Terminal concession of the Port of Djibouti to a Chinese competitor of concession partner DP World, an UAE-based port operator. In February 2018, Ismaïl Guelleh revoked DP World’s concession by presidential decree, transferring its assets to a state-run company. Using Chinese funding, that same year Djibouti also opened a long-term project to build what is projected to be Africa’s greatest free trade zone.

In 2020, the London Court of International Arbitration ruled Djibouti’s expropriation illegal and ordered the original concession rights are to be restored. The Court had previously ordered the country to pay $533 million in compensation to the DP World company. Djibouti rejected the Court’s ruling and handed a quarter of the port&#x27;s stake to China Merchants Ports Holdings.

=== Economy ===

While the FDI-driven policy into port and logistics infrastructure pursued by Guelleh has been responsible for steady economic growth, it has created a service-dependent and capital-intensive economy with low exports and opportunities for job creation. Indeed, unemployment remains an enduring issue that disproportionally affects the young. According to a 2015 employment survey, Djibouti’s unemployment rate was at 39 percent, where only 25 percent of working age people were employed. A more recent estimate puts unemployment of the young at 80 percent.

Furthermore, the investment projects behind the country’s economic growth throughout the years were financed by external debt, which has led to high levels of debt ownership by foreign actors, particularly China. Overall, the country’s economy was ranked as &quot;mostly unfree&quot; by the Heritage Foundation’s 2021 Index of Economic Freedom.

The expansion of the Berbera port in Somaliland by DP World, which would reduce landlocked Ethiopia’s dependence on Djibouti for large parts of its trade, has been speculated to pose a threat to the port of Djibouti’s regional dominance. Guelleh has dismissed such claims.

=== Regional security ===
Djibouti under Guelleh’s rule has remained a stable country within a conflict-ridden region. Guelleh’s presidency has seen the signing of a peace agreement between warring ethnic tribes in 2000 and the resolution of a decade-long border dispute between Djibouti and Eritrea in 2018. The 2018 peace treaty between Ethiopia and Eritrea is expected to reduce Djibouti’s port revenues in the long-run and could in turn lead to Guelleh becoming unable to maintain his stringent control over the country.

In 2020, Guelleh hosted the leaders of Somalia and its break-away Republic of Somaliland as well as Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for peace talks.

Guelleh expressed strong support for Ethiopia&#x27;s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in the Tigray War between the government and the rebels, saying that he had chosen to &quot;restore law and order at the federal level, and punish those seeking to break up the country&quot; and dismissed the prospect of negotiations, saying that the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front had &quot;structured itself so as to bring the central government to its knees&quot; and that talks could &quot;only lead to the partition of Ethiopia&quot;, setting a precedent for secession by other groups in the region.

== Personal life ==
Ismail Guelleh is married with four children.

Following a visit of Guelleh and his entourage to Paris in late 2018, France’s National Financial Prosecutor&#x27;s Office opened a preliminary investigation into the alleged fraudulent acquisition of several properties in the city. The investigation, launched after a complaint from anti-corruption NGO Sherpa and focusing on Guelleh’s wife, eldest daughter and son in law, is ongoing as of July 2021.

He owns a property in Dubai.

<doc id="392347" wikidata="Q442511" url="?curid=392347" title="Gyude Bryant">
<text>Charles Gyude Bryant (17 January 1949 – 16 April 2014) was a Liberian politician and businessman. He served as the Chairman of the Transitional Government of Liberia from 14 October 2003 to 16 January 2006. The installation of the transitional government was part of the peace agreement to end the country&#x27;s second civil war, which had raged since the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) rebelled against President Charles Taylor in 1999. Bryant was previously a businessman and was chosen as chairman because he was seen as politically neutral and therefore acceptable to each of the warring factions, which included LURD, the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), and loyalists of former President Taylor. He was a prominent member of the Episcopal Church of Liberia, and was critical of the governments of Samuel Doe (1980–90) and Taylor (1997–2003).

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf won the 2005 elections and took office in January 2006, succeeding Bryant.

He died on 16 April 2014 at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia.

==Embezzlement==
In January 2007, Bryant was questioned by police regarding allegations of corruption during his time in office. On 27 February 2007, Bryant was charged with embezzlement. His government is alleged to have embezzled more than US$1 million. On 12 March a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was not immediately arrested because he was said to be absent from Monrovia and in Lofa County instead, but on 13 March he was arrested and released on bond shortly thereafter. In court on 25 April, the defense argued that Bryant constitutionally enjoyed immunity for actions taken as head of state, while the prosecution argued that he did not because his appointment resulted from the Accra Accords in August 2003 and occurred outside the constitutional framework. On 24 August 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the prosecution&#x27;s argument, enabling Bryant&#x27;s trial to continue.

Bryant was arrested on 7 December 2007 after failing to appear in court earlier in the week. He had said that he was boycotting the court because of his belief that he enjoys immunity. As he was being taken to a prison in Monrovia, he said: &quot;This is a very, very dark day for Liberia. This is the reward we get for restoring peace and democracy to our country.&quot; He was released from the central prison in Monrovia on 8 December after he signed a commitment to appear in court on 10 December.

On 30 April 2009, Bryant, along with four others, was acquitted of embezzling US$1 million from the state oil refinery. Additional charges regarding the alleged theft of US$1.3 million from the state were dropped on 24 September 2010 as the government failed to provide any proof of wrongdoing.

==Personal==
Born in Monrovia during the early years of the Tubman era, Bryant&#x27;s mother was a descendant of settlers and his father was a member of the Grebo people. He matriculated at Cuttington University in 1972, and in 1974 he married the former Rosilee Williams; together they had two children, Cheryl and Charles. Bryant also had a son named Charles Mleh. Before becoming the chairman of the interim government, he was a successful businessman operating a company that supplied machinery for the Freeport of Monrovia, and he was the chairman of the Liberian Action Party, which has since merged with President Sirleaf&#x27;s Unity Party.

<doc id="392350" wikidata="Q2666591" url="?curid=392350" title="Chair of the Federal Reserve">
<text>The chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is the head of the Federal Reserve, and is the active executive officer of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The chairman presides at meetings of the Board.

The chairman serves a four-year term after being nominated by the president of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate; the officeholder serves concurrently as a member of the Board of Governors. The chairman may serve multiple terms, pending a new nomination and confirmation at the end of each term; William McChesney Martin (1951-1970) was the longest serving chair, with Alan Greenspan (1987-2006) a close second. The president may not have the legal authority to dismiss a chairman before the end of a term, although this assumption has never been tested in court.

The current chairman is Jerome Powell, who was sworn in on February 5, 2018. He was nominated to the position by President Donald Trump on November 2, 2017, and later confirmed by the Senate. He was subsequently nominated to a second term by President Joe Biden, later confirmed by the Senate and sworn in on May 23, 2022.

== Appointment process ==

As stipulated by the Banking Act of 1935, the Chairman is chosen by the president from among the sitting governors to serve four-year terms with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Senate Committee responsible for vetting a Federal Reserve chair nominee is the Senate Committee on Banking.

== Duties of the Fed chairman == 
By law, at meetings of the Board the chairman shall preside, and, in his absence, the vice chairman shall preside. In the absence of the chairman and the vice chairman, the Board shall elect a member to act as chairman pro tempore.

Under the chairman&#x27;s leadership, the Board&#x27;s responsibilities include analysis of domestic and international financial and economic developments. The board also supervises and regulates the Federal Reserve Banks, exercises responsibility in the nation&#x27;s payments system, and administers consumer credit protection laws.

By custom, one of the chairman&#x27;s most important duties is to serve as the chair of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is critical in setting short-term U.S. monetary policy. However, the chair of the FOMC is elected at the first meeting of each year, and while the chair of the Board of Governors has always been chosen there is no legal obligation for this to be the case.

By law, the chairman reports twice a year to Congress on the Federal Reserve&#x27;s monetary policy objectives. He or she also testifies before Congress on numerous other financial issues and meets periodically with the treasury secretary, who is a member of the president&#x27;s Cabinet.

== Conflict of interest law ==
The law applicable to the chair and all other members of the board provides (in part):

==Salary==
Chair of the Federal Reserve is a Level I position in the Executive Schedule, thus earning the salary prescribed for that level (US$246,400, as of April 2024).

==List of Fed chairs==
The following is a list of past and present chairs of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. A chair serves for a four-year term after appointment, but may be reappointed for several consecutive four-year terms. Since the Federal Reserve was established in 1914, the following people have served as chair.

<doc id="392353" wikidata="Q653611" url="?curid=392353" title="Hipólito Mejía">
<text>Rafael Hipólito Mejía Domínguez (born 22 February 1941) is a Dominican politician who served as President of the Dominican Republic from 2000 to 2004.

During his presidential term in office the country was affected by one of its worst economic crises, generated by the bankruptcy of three major commercial banks in the country, which resulted in high inflation, high country risk rating, currency devaluation and increasing local poverty. Mejía sent 604 Dominican troops to fight in the Iraq War.

In the presidential election of 2004, he ran for a second term as the candidate of the Dominican Revolutionary Party but he was defeated by Leonel Fernández, whom he had succeeded as president in 2000, from the Dominican Liberation Party.

== Early life ==
Mejía Domínguez was born on 22 February 1941 at the &quot;José María Cabral y Báez&quot; Hospital in Santiago de los Caballeros, as the first child of Hipólito de Jesús ‘Polín’ Mejía Díaz and María Josefa ‘Marina’ Domínguez Viñals, both native of La Chichigua in Gurabo, place where he was raised. In his hometown he is known as &quot;Cabuyita&quot;, diminutive for &quot;cabuya&quot; (Latin American Spanish for &quot;Agave twine&quot;), because of the long blond straight hair that he had during his youth.

Mejía received a high school diploma from the Loyola Polytechnic Institute in San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic, graduating in 1962. Two years later, he attended special programs at North Carolina State University in the United States. On 4 July 1964 he married Rosa Gómez Arias, his third cousin. They have four children, among them, Carolina Mejía de Garrigó, a 2016 vice-presidential candidate.

At age twenty-four, he was appointed director and undersecretary of the national Tobacco Institute. In 1978, he was appointed Minister of Agriculture under the government of President Antonio Guzmán Fernández. During this period, agri-business incentive laws were passed and programs to promote rural agriculture development and technification were undertaken.

In 1982, Mejia was defeated in his campaign to become senator from Santiago Province. In 1990, he was named vice-presidential candidate on the ticket of Dominican Revolutionary Party leader José Francisco Peña Gómez.

== Presidency ==
In 2000, Mejía ran for president as the candidate of the left leaning Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) on a program to increase health, education, and social security services through tax hikes. He led the field in the 2000 presidential election, taking 49.87% of the vote in the first round. His main opponents, Danilo Medina and former president Joaquín Balaguer, received 24.9% and 24.6% of the vote, respectively.

With Mejía just a few thousand votes short of the threshold for avoiding a runoff, his supporters claimed victory and urged Medina to concede. Medina soon realized that he stood no chance of closing a nearly 25-point gap with Mejía, especially when Balaguer suggested that some of his supporters might cross over to the PRD in the runoff. Medina would have needed nearly all of Balaguer&#x27;s voters to cross over to him in order to have any realistic chance of winning. Accordingly, Medina pulled out of the runoff, handing the presidency to Mejía. Mejía took office on 16 August of that year.

During his presidency, he supported many popular issues, like social security, helping small businesses, agriculture, improving education and helping with adequate housing. He received considerable support from the people during the first two years of his mandate, which caused his party to win the congressional and municipal elections taking control of the Senate with 29 out of 31 senators.

During Mejía’s term, the country&#x27;s second largest privately held commercial bank, Baninter, collapsed in a spectacular failure tied to long-standing political corruption. However, no evidence has ever linked Mejia to any corruption nor was he ever taken to court. Actually, it was later proved by international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund that the bank was fraudulently caused to fail − something for which its President and CEO Ramón Báez Figueroa was years later found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

During his term, Mejía attempted to spread government resources and services to thousands of smaller, rural communities scattered around the country instead of the traditional efforts to concentrate on big cities (where most voters live). He established the country&#x27;s first social security type retirement system, and created a fixed advanced corporate tax of 1.5% to aid in government revenue collection.

His administration was packed with corruption and cronyism and also was not able to achieve the economic success and stability of his predecessor.

In March 2004, the Haiti Commission of Inquiry, headed by former US attorney general Ramsey Clark, published its findings : &quot;Noting that 200 US special forces had travelled to the Dominican Republic for “military exercises” in February 2003, the commission accused the US of arming and training Haitian rebels there. With permission from the Dominican president, Hipólito Mejía, US forces trained near the border, in an area used by former soldiers of the disbanded Haitian army to launch attacks on Haitian state property.&quot; In the 2004 presidential election, he was defeated by Leonel Fernández, when he ran for re-election for a second term.

By the time Mejía left office, the Dominican Republic was undergoing a major economic crisis.

Mejía again contested the 2012 presidential election, losing to Danilo Medina, his 2000 election opponent.

== Criticism ==
In his time, Mejía faced both the highest and then the lowest approval ratings for a Constitutional President in recent times.

Mejía&#x27;s first presidential campaign in 2000 won him the first Dominican presidency under then new electoral rules that required a &quot;50 más 1&quot; (50 percent plus one of the total votes in order to win in the first voting round.) This was in stark contrast to the late PRD leader, José Francisco Peña Gómez, who unsuccessfully ran for office three times consecutively (1990, 1994 and 1996) and never received the support that Mejia received in his first attempt.

While holding the seat of Head of State, Mejía actively sought to change the then current constitution in order for it to allow consecutive presidential re-elections. This was achieved with the aid of his party&#x27;s majority stake at both legislative chambers (Senate and Lower Chamber). The original constitution prevented the previous president from contending against him in 2000.

== Ancestry ==
Three of Mejía′s grandparents were farmers native to Gurabo (Santiago Province, not to be confused with a city in Puerto Rico) while his paternal grandfather, Segundo Mejía Mejía, was from Hato de San Marcos de Cañafístol (Peravia Province), then a ranch estate near Baní.

The Domínguez and the Díaz hails from Gurabo, being of colonial Canarian background. These families were traditionally farmers and merchants.

The Viñals hails from Santo Domingo of colonial Catalan background.

The Mejías from Cañafístol, Baní, were well-to-do white ranchers linked to the colonial petite aristocracy since the 1500s; endogamy was the custom in small communities and almost every generation of the Mejías married with relatives, meaning that Hipólito Mejía&#x27;s bloodline includes several cousin marriages. President Mejía himself was married to a cousin, as well, until his wife&#x27;s death in 2022.

Through his Báez, Villar and Soto ancestors, President Mejía is distantly related through many lines to President Danilo Medina, via Medina′s paternal grandfather —José María Medina Báez— who, alike Mejía′s paternal grandfather, was also from Baní. Three of Medina Báez grandparents were surnamed Báez. Their shared ancestors includes Lorenzo Báez de Cuéllar-Albornoz (seven times seventh cousins through him), Pedro del Villar María (four times seventh cousins through him), María de la Cruz de Arambule Maldonado (four times sixth cousins through her), Esteban Peguero Gómez (seven times ninth cousins through him), and Antonio de Soto y Hernández de Andújar.

==Popular culture==
A political poster with Mejía&#x27;s face appears in the music video of Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Warning&quot; at the time frame 1:55.

<text>The 25-pair color code, originally known as even-count color code, is a color code used to identify individual conductors in twisted-pair wiring for telecommunications.

==Color coding==
With the development of new generations of telecommunication cables with polyethylene-insulated conductors (&quot;PIC&quot;) by Bell Laboratories for the Bell System in the 1950s, new methods were developed to mark each individual conductor in cables. Each wire is identified by the combination of two colors, one of which is the major color, and the second the minor color. Major and minor colors are chosen from two different groups of five, resulting in 25 color combinations. The color combinations are applied to the insulation that covers each conductor. Typically, one color is a prominent background color of the insulation, and the other is a tracer, consisting of stripes, rings, or dots, applied over the background. The background color always matches the tracer color of its paired conductor, and vice versa.

The major, or primary group of colors consists of the sequence of white, red, black, yellow, and violet (mnemonics Why Run Backwards, You&#x27;ll Vomit). The minor, or secondary color is chosen from the sequence blue, orange, green, brown, and slate (mnemonics Bell Operators Give Better Service).

The wire pairs are referenced directly by their color combination, or by the pair number. For example, &quot;pair 9&quot; is also called the &quot;red-brown pair&quot;. In technical tabulations, the colors are often suitably abbreviated.

&quot;Violet&quot; is the standard name in the telecommunications and electronics industry, but it is sometimes referred to as &quot;purple&quot;. Similarly, &quot;slate&quot; is a particular shade of gray. The names of most of the colors were taken from the conventional colors of the rainbow or optical spectrum, and in the electronic color code, which uses the same ten colors, albeit in a different order.

When used for plain old telephone service (POTS), the first wire is known as the &quot;tip&quot; or &quot;A&quot;-leg (U.K.) conductor, and is usually connected to the positive side of a direct current (DC) circuit, while the second wire is known as the &quot;ring&quot; lead or &quot;B&quot;-leg (U.K.), and is connected to the negative side of the circuit. Neither of these two sides of the line has a connection to the local ground. This creates a balanced audio circuit with common-mode rejection, also known as a differential pair. The tip and ring convention is based on the ″ (6.5 mm) TRS phone connectors, which were employed in telephone switchboards in the 19th and 20th centuries, where the tip contact of the connector is separated from the ring contact by a spacer of insulation. The connection furthest from the cable is known as the &quot;tip&quot;, the middle connection is the &quot;ring&quot;, and the (largest) connection closest to the wire is the &quot;sleeve&quot;.

==25-pair telco cable pinout==
A common application of the 25-pair color code is the cabling for the Registered Jack interface RJ21, which uses a female 50-pin miniature ribbon connector, as shown in the following table. The geometry of the pins of the receptacle (right hand image) corresponds to the pin numbers of the table. The left column of pins are the ring (R) conductors, while all tip (T) conductors are on the right.

== Larger cables ==
For cables with more than 25 pairs, each group of 25 is called a binder group. The binder groups are marked with mylar ribbons using the same color coding system, starting with a white/blue ribbon, then a white/orange ribbon, and so on. The 24th binder group has a violet/brown ribbon, completing a &quot;super binder&quot; of 600 pairs.

In cables of more than 600 pairs, each of the 600-pair super binder group bundles is wrapped with a mylar binder ribbon, or string, matching the &quot;tip&quot; colors of the color code, starting with white. The pattern then starts over with the first 25-pair group as white/blue, and continues indefinitely, in multiples of 600 pairs or parts thereof. For example, a 900-pair cable has the first 600 pairs in 24 groups of 25 pairs in a white binder, and the remaining 300 pairs in 12 groups of 25 pairs wrapped in a red binder.

Some cables are &quot;mirrored&quot; or &quot;clocked&quot; with a pattern that is known throughout the telephone industry. Starting with the first binder group in the center, the technician counts the cable&#x27;s groups in a spiral direction depending on the location of the central office or switch. If looking at the cable&#x27;s core and the switch is in that direction, the groups are counted counter-clockwise. If the cable is the &quot;field side&quot;, the count is clockwise. There are indicators on the mylar ribbons to know where to begin for each layer and a diagram for the different cable sizes should be readily available for reference.

Other color schemes are sometimes used for outdoor cables, particularly outside the U.S., but this color code is common for aerial and underground cables up to several thousand pairs in North America. In the UK, the British Post Office (later BT) used this color code for what is now known loosely as CW1308 specification cables, referring to the Post Office&#x27;s &quot;Cable and Wire&quot; specification No. 1308.

== Extra pairs and colors ==

When working on aerial cable splicing and installation, it is common to use a telephone lineman&#x27;s set or &quot;butt set&quot; to communicate over long distances. To facilitate this, extra pairs of wires are embedded in cables using &quot;major&quot; colors for both wires (instead of the major/minor color combinations used for the rest). One extra pair (red-white) may be embedded into cables that are 6 to 75 pairs; two pairs (red-white and black-white) may be encapsulated in cables of 100 to 300 pairs; and three pairs (red-white, black-white, and yellow-white) may be included in cables of 400 to 900 pairs. These extra pairs are often referred to as &quot;talk pairs&quot;, and are never used for subscriber service.

==Other color codings==
===Inside quad wiring===
Older Bell System wiring inside customer premises used a cable type with four conductors of solid copper wire with the insulation colors red, green, yellow, and black (legacy) or a two-color code of blue, orange, and white.
===Optical cable===
A color coding method used for fiber-optic cables, TIA-598-C, starts with the same first ten colors, adding the color rose for 11, and aqua for 12.

<doc id="392360" wikidata="Q381002" url="?curid=392360" title="Francisco Flores Pérez">
<text>Francisco Guillermo Flores Pérez (17 October 1959 – 30 January 2016) was a Salvadoran politician who served as President of El Salvador from 1 June 1999 to 1 June 2004 as a member of the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA). He previously served as a deputy of the Legislative Assembly from 1994 to 1999, having been president of the Assembly from 1997 to 1999.

Flores was born in Santa Ana. He entered politics in the Alfredo Cristiani administration, serving various positions until his election to the Legislative Assembly, of which he became president after three years. He successfully ran for president in 1999. His administration was characterized by close alignment with the United States, including the adoption of the U.S. dollar. After the end of his presidency, he unsuccessfully ran for Secretary General of the Organization of American States.

Flores was accused in May 2014 of pocketing US$15 million donated by Taiwan, intended for survivors of the January and February 2001 El Salvador earthquakes, which occurred during his presidency. He was the first former Salvadoran president to be indicted and tried on corruption charges. He was placed under house arrest, but died before he could stand trial.

==Background==
Flores was born on 17 October 1959, in the city of Santa Ana, the capital of Santa Ana Department. He was one of three children of Maria Leonor Pérez de Flores, an ethnographer and folklorist, and Ulises Flores, an economist. Flores graduated from the Escuela Americana El Salvador. He earned an associate degree in sociology from the University of Hartford&#x27;s Hillyer College, then, majored in political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts, United States, and received a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy at World University, California. He also studied law, philosophy and economic development at Harvard University and history and literature at Trinity College, Oxford. He entered politics shortly before the assassination of his father-in-law, who was chief of staff to Alfredo Cristiani.

==Political career==
Flores started his political career as a vice-minister for planning during Alfredo Cristiani&#x27;s presidency in 1989. Later he served as a vice-minister of the Presidency, with functions as adviser of the head of state, and directed the plan of governmental action in accordance with the peace accords of January 1992 that ended fighting with the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) guerilla group.

In the elections of 20 March 1994, Flores was elected to the Legislative Assembly and the new president, Armando Calderón, made him Secretary of Information of the Presidency.

In 1997, Flores was elected as the President of the Legislative Assembly. The Law of Telecommunications was signed during his presidency of the Legislative Assembly, in which the former government-owned telecommunication company ANTEL was split and sold to two private enterprises. This was supported with approval from ARENA, PCN and PDC, imitating the neoliberal system that supported the administration of governmental agencies by the private enterprise, to improve telecommunication network coverage.

On 29 March 1998, ARENA announced Flores as their candidate for the presidential election of the following year. He was considered a moderate within the party. At the age of 37 (the youngest chief executive on the continent at that time), Flores became the third consecutive president from ARENA by winning an outright majority in the elections in March 1999, and took office on 1 June 1999. He served his five-year term and was succeeded by another member of his political party, Elías Antonio Saca, in July 2004.

==Presidency (1999–2004)==
Flores&#x27;s government was characterized by its close alignment with United States policies. El Salvador was one of the steadiest allies of the U.S. government in the region. Three undertakings during his term best exemplify Flores&#x27;s commitment to close US-Salvadoran relations: First, Flores authorized the deployment of Salvadoran troops to Iraq in support of U.S. forces. Second, during his term a successful free-trade agreement was negotiated between the United States and the Central American region, with the late addition of the Dominican Republic to the roster of participating nations; this agreement was ratified recently by most of the region&#x27;s countries as well as the U.S. Congress. Finally, Flores was the architect of the Salvadoran economy&#x27;s migration from its historical currency, the colón, to the U.S. dollar.

Dollarization was an extremely controversial measure, both lauded and panned by local and foreign opinion. From the standpoint of the country&#x27;s business establishment, dollarization brought about great benefits, such as reduced interest rates (which came about by eliminating currency-exchange risk among other factors), easier trade with other commercial partners and an easier integration onto the global market.

His tenure was marked by an unprecedented rise in the homicide rate, which doubled between 2002 and 2006.

===Criticism===
Flores&#x27;s tenure was not without its critics. His actions to further align El Salvador with the United States were widely criticized by his political opponents. In the same manner, he was faulted for an autocratic style of governance, which allowed for very little compromise or consultation with the opposition. The lack of flexibility exemplified by his government resulted in a number of crippling strikes, most notably one led by the medical professionals in an attempt to forestall threatened privatization of the country&#x27;s public health facilities.

Critics of Flores&#x27;s dollarization efforts accused him of doing so without popular consensus, except exclusively with bankers. Even though the replacement of Colones with dollars proved to reduce interest rates, it also caused huge long-term inflation as prices were rounded upwards.

Flores also had to deal with reconstruction efforts after two powerful earthquakes struck the country on 13 January 2001. Delivery of international aid was inefficient and was criticized by reporters, especially Mauricio Funes (who later became President of El Salvador) from the local channel TV12, an affiliate of the Mexican company TV Azteca.

Some of Flores&#x27;s opponents also contended that escalating violence and increasing poverty occurred during his term, but statistics from the World Bank show that poverty did, in fact, decrease during the Flores administration.

Another occurrence was the Summit of the Americas where Flores called Fidel Castro a &quot;dictator&quot; and accused him of being responsible for thousands of deaths which have occurred in El Salvador.

==Candidacy for OAS Secretary General==

Even before he left office, Flores had expressed his interest in running for the office of Secretary General of the Organization of American States, a post which was won in late 2004 by Miguel Ángel Rodríguez an ex-president from Costa Rica. Later, Rodríguez had to resign from this post when he was indicted in his country for alleged acts of corruption during his tenure as president, a situation which called for an extraordinary election for his successor. Flores once again expressed his intentions of seeking the post, but after much campaigning, had to withdraw due to lack of support from other member states (even though he counted the United States as his chief backer). This situation could be explained because some of his policies were seen as being to closely aligned to US interests at a time when most Latin American governments were highly critical of the positions adopted by the United States. He was the first US-backed candidate not elected to this post since the establishment of the organization.

==Corruption charges==
At the time of his death, Flores was, along with several other key actors in the deal, being investigated by the Salvadoran Attorney General on corruption and disobedience charges. These recommendations now face scrutiny and debate in the Legislative Assembly. Attorney General Luis Martínez was to have taken up the case against the late former president despite his own prior history of having worked in the previous ARENA administration of Tony Saca and having been Flores&#x27;s partner in several businesses.

Judge Marta Rosales asked Interpol for help in arresting Flores. He had been charged with stealing $15 million that was donated in 2003 by Taiwan&#x27;s government during his presidency.

A further charge of disobedience accused Flores of failing to show up for a meeting with a congressional commission investigating what happened to the money Taiwan donated. On 6 September 2014, it was announced that Flores had voluntarily surrendered to the local authorities after months in hiding. He had been living under house arrest in El Salvador since November 2014. On 3 December 2015, Judge Miguel Angel Garcia ordered Flores to stand trial.

In October 2021, his name was mentioned in the Pandora Papers. He was the beneficiary of several companies created in Panama in 2005 and in the British Virgin Islands in 2006.

==Death==
In early January 2016, Flores suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. On 30 January 2016, Flores died, aged 56, in a private hospital in San Salvador while in a coma after undergoing emergency surgery and suffering irreversible neurological damage.

==Personal life==
Flores met his wife, Lourdes Rodríguez de Flores, in high school in San Salvador. They had two children, Juan Marcos and Gabriela.

<text>is one of ten wards of the city of Saitama, in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. Located in the northeast of the city, Urawa is the governmental center of Saitama and houses most of the city&#x27;s administrative offices including the city hall, as well as the offices of Saitama Prefectural government. Also, there are several newspaper branch offices and three broadcasting stations.

==Geography==
Urawa Ward is within the Ōmiya Plateau of the Kantō plain, in the south-central portion of Saitama City.

===Neighboring Municipalities===
Urawa-ku is surrounded by Midori-ku (to the east), Minami-ku (south), Chūō-ku (west), Ōmiya-ku (north), and Minuma-ku (northeast) of Saitama city.

==History==
In the Edo period, Urawa-ku flourished as Urawa-shuku, a post station on the Nakasendō highway, which connected Edo with Kyoto. Following the Meiji restoration, Urawa Prefecture was established, and in 1871 merged with Iwatsuki, Urawa, and Oshi Prefectures merged to form Saitama Prefecture, and Urawa as the capital. The modern town of Urawa was officially created within Kitaadachi District, Saitama with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889.

After the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake many intellectuals, especially painters, moved to Urawa from Tokyo, Yokohama, and other cities in southern Kantō region. In 1932, Urawa annexed the neighboring villages of Yada and Kisaki, and was elevated to city status on February 11, 1934. Urawa expanded further by annexing the villages of Omagi and Mimuro on April 17, 1940 and town of Mutsuji on April 1, 1942. During World War II, Urawa was bombed twice by Allied forces in April and May 1945.

Urawa continued to expand after the end of the war, absorbing the villages of Tsuchiai and Okubo on January 1, 1955 and part of the town of Toda on April 1, 1959 and part of the village of Misono on May 1, 1962.

On May 1, 2001 Urawa merged with Ōmiya and Yono to form Saitama City. In April 2003 Saitama became a city designated by government ordinance, and now the area of former Urawa City was divided between Sakura-ku, Urawa-ku, Minami-ku, and Midori-ku.

<doc id="392367" wikidata="Q57348" url="?curid=392367" title="Isaias Afwerki">
<text>Isaias Afwerki (, ; born 2 February 1946) is an Eritrean politician who has been the president of Eritrea since 1993 and the chairman of the People&#x27;s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) since 1994.

Isaias joined the pro-independence Eritrean Liberation Front in 1966 and quickly rose through the ranks to become its leader in 1970, before defecting to form the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front (EPLF). Having consolidated power within this group, he led pro-independence forces to victory on 24 May 1991, ending the 30-year-old war for independence from Ethiopia, before being elected president of the newly-founded country of Eritrea two years later.

Western scholars and historians have long considered Isaias to be a dictator, with Eritrea&#x27;s constitution remaining unenforced, electoral institutions effectively being nonexistent as well as a policy of mass conscription. The United Nations and Amnesty International have cited him for human rights violations. In 2024, Reporters Without Borders ranked Eritrea, under the government of Isaias, last out of 180 countries in its Press Freedom Index.

==Early life and education==
Isaias Afwerki was born on 2 February 1946 in the Aba Shi&#x27;Aul district of Asmara. His father, whose native village was Tselot, just outside of Asmara, was a minor functionary in the state tobacco monopoly, his mother was descended from Tigrayan immigrants from the Enderta region of Ethiopia.

Isaias spent most of his youth in Asmara. He attended Prince Makonnen High School (now called Asmara Secondary School) where he engaged in discussions about nationalist Eritrean politics. In 1965, he began his studies at the College of Engineering at Haile Selassie I University (now called Addis Ababa University) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but due to lower scores in his first-year first semester he was supposed to retake the first semester which he didn&#x27;t. However, he maintained his interest in Eritrean politics and informed his friends that he was planning to join the Eritrean rebels in the field.

== Eritrean War of Independence ==

In September 1966, Isaias along with Haile Woldense and Mussie Tesfamichael traveled to Kassala, Sudan, via Asmara to join the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF). Isaias and his comrades had assumed the ELF was an inclusive revolutionary organization, but they soon realized that the movement was sectarian and generally hostile to Christians. Isaias, Haile and Mussie decided to organized subvertly, forming a secret clandestine cell. To seal their pact the three men signed an oath with their own blood, carving an &#x27;E&#x27; on their right arms, symbolizing their determination to die for Eritrea. In 1967, the Chinese government took in five ELF recruits for political commissar training. Among those recruits were Isaias where he studied Maoism as well as the strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare. On his return trip he was arrested by Saudi Arabian authorities while attempting to cross the Red Sea on a dhow, he was released nearly six months later.

Upon his return in 1968, Isaias was appointed as a political commissioner of the ELF&#x27;s Zone 5 in the Hamasien region. He and other ELF members began to criticize the sectarian tendencies of the ELF. In 1969, further power struggles among the ELF leadership and the assassination of several Christian members led to the defection of the ELF&#x27;s Zone 5 which included Isaias. This group of around seventy fighters, led by Abraham Tewolde, withdrew to an isolated locality, Ala in northeast of the Akele Guzay near Dekemhare where they were joined by another small contingent of Kebessa fighters under Mesfin Hagos, together they became known as the Ala group. Following Tewolde&#x27;s death in late 1970, Isaias became the leader of the group.

In August 1971, this group of Christian deflectors held a meeting at Tekli (northern Red Sea) and founded the &quot;Selfi Natsinet&quot; (“Independence Party“). They elected a leadership consisting of Isaias, Mesfin Hagos, Tewolde Eyob, Solomon Woldemariam and Asmerom Gerezgiher. They then issued a highly polemical document written by Isaias called, &quot;Nihnan Elamanan&quot; (“We and Our Goals”), in which they explained the rationale for their decision to create a separate political organization instead of working within the ELF. The document accused the ELF of discriminating against Christian highlanders and killing reformist Christian ELF members. The document instead stressed the unity of the Eritrean nation and called for a &quot;revolutionary organization with a revolutionary line&quot;. In August 1971, Selfi Natsinet joined the Popular Liberation Forces (PLF), forming a loose alliance with two other splinter groups, these three groups were jointly represented by Osman Saleh Sabbe.

In February 1972, the ELF declared war on the PLF resulting in a civil war that would last until 1974. During this time, a significant number of Asmara high school and University of Addis Ababa students were recruited which resulted in the Selfi Natsinet becoming the most powerful group within the PLF. A major crisis occurred when the Obel faction led by the former Sudanese army NCO Abu Tayyara, left the group in April 1973. Isaias then called for a more unified administration and military force, which led to the emergence of the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front (EPLF) in August 1973. Internal agitation soon arose when the Marxist faction, led by his old friend Mussie Tesfamichael, called for more radical policies and began to accuse the movement of being too authoritarian. Isaias denounced his rivals in a publication and mobilized his supporters to arrest Mussie and other colleagues. After a brief trial, all eleven EPLF leaders including Mussie were executed on 11 August 1974. In 1977, EPLF held its first congress, at which Isaias was elected vice-secretary general.

Although Isaias had to initially share power with others who led the EPLF, by the early 1980s he was able to transform it into the movement he envisioned. The EPLF became a tough nationalist organization controlled by a highly centralized inner party which made all the important decisions. From the mid 1980s, Isaias made a bid to marginalize the political core of the EPLF&#x27;s founding leadership and pack the political bodies with men unwaveringly loyal to him. This coincided with the second congress of the EPLF in 1987, when he was elevated to the status of secretary-general of the organization. According to Dan Connell, this was approximately when Isaias took unquestioned control of the EPLF. As the leader of the Eritrean struggle against Ethiopian rule, Isaias became the icon of the resistance. In April 1991, the EPLF took Asmara from Ethiopian forces; the following month, they drove out Derg troops in the area. After the Derg was overthrown by the EPRDF on 28 May, Isaias quickly obtained U.S. support for Eritrean independence; in June 1991, his organization announced their desire to hold a United Nations-sponsored referendum.

== Presidency (1993–present) ==
=== Independence of Eritrea ===

In April 1993, a United Nations-supervised referendum on independence was held, and the following month Eritrea achieved &quot;de jure&quot; independence. Isaias was elected as the president of the State of Eritrea by the National Assembly and declared the first head of state, a position he has held ever since the end of the war for independence.

On 16 February 1994, the EPLF held its third congress, renamed itself the People&#x27;s Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) as part of its transition to a political party and Isaias was elected secretary-general by an overwhelming majority of votes. Isaias undertook a series of economic reforms. He implemented a national service program in May 1994 in which individuals would serve for 18 months. Military training was the focus for the first six months, followed by awareness of the country and expansion of its agricultural sector.

=== Domestic policy ===

==== Elections ====
In his first few years Isaias was hailed as a new type of African president with then-US President Bill Clinton referring to him as a &quot;renaissance African leader&quot;. However, in 1997, a new constitution was drawn up, but never enacted, and elections were cancelled. In an April 2000 speech at Princeton University, Isaias said that &quot;constitutionality, political pluralism and free and fair elections are naturally the best institutional tools&quot; for achieving economic prosperity given the political and cultural realities of a specific country. However, a parliamentary election scheduled in 2001 was later postponed indefinitely. Although police are responsible for upholding internal security and the armed forces&#x27; external security, eyewitness reports exist of the armed forces engaging with demobilizing soldiers or civilian militias to complete the hybrid tasks of both. Civil authorities sometimes involve themselves with security forces in an abuse of power.

In 2018, Isaias&#x27; former comrade, Andebrhan Welde Giorgis, said that Isaias went on to personalise power, and &quot;having personalised power, he abused it to the maximum&quot;. Notwithstanding, during the African Unity summit in Cairo in 1993, Isaias had criticized other leaders for staying in power for too long, and he had also rejected a cult of personality.

In 2000, 15 ministers (including his vice president) wrote an open letter asking him to step down. On September 18, 2001, he closed the national press and prominent opposition leaders were arrested. In 2010, when asked when elections would be held, he responded &quot;Let&#x27;s wait 3 or 4 decades&quot;.

==== Economics ====
In 2009, Isaias advocated for the development of indigenous political and economic institutions, and a strategy that suited Eritrea&#x27;s internal conditions and available resources. The key elements were to include ambitious infrastructure development campaigns both in terms of power, transport, and telecommunications, as well as with basic healthcare and educational facilities.

According to the World Bank, Eritrea&#x27;s recent growth has been associated with the agricultural (one-third of the economy and 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)) and mining sectors (20 percent). Real GDP grew by 12 percent in 2018, but fell 2.7 percent from 2015 to 2018. Deflation existed from 2016 to 2018 due to a currency change, and continued in 2018 after economic and trade ties with Ethiopia were reestablished.On 18 May 2012, Isaias said in a VOA interview that the country&#x27;s development over two decades of independence was &quot;a success story&quot;. As a result of regional insecurity in 1998, Eritrea has a strong fiscal policy caused by a sharp drop in capital spending and reductions in revenue. Fiscal pressures, however, are likely to increase.

==== Human rights ====

As of 2013, Amnesty International reported that the government of Isaias imprisoned at least 10,000 political prisoners. Amnesty also claimed that torture—for punishment, interrogation and coercion—is widespread.

In June 2015, a United Nations panel accused Isaias of leading a totalitarian government responsible for systematic human rights violations in Eritrea that may amount to crimes against humanity. Norwegian academic Kjetil Tronvoll said that concentration camps for individuals from opposition groups and labor camps with makeshift facilities (often made from shipping containers) exist. The government has banned independent newspapers and arrested journalists critical of Isaias since 2001, including G-15: a group of People&#x27;s Front for Democracy and Justice officials who appealed for an open election. Eritrea is closed to human-rights organizations, who are forced to obtain information from émigrés.

The government has been accused of enforced disappearances; torture; arbitrary detention, censorship; libel; human trafficking; criminalizing same-sex activity; arbitrary and unlawful violations of privacy, judicial independence, freedom of speech, association, movement and religion; and forced labor (including national service past the 18-month legal obligation). An August 2015 Human Rights Watch (HRW) report documented the use of unlawful force (torture and battery) by security authorities against prisoners, national service evaders, army deserters, asylum seekers without travel documents, and religious groups. In June 2018, a thirty-year-old man reportedly died as a result of torture and delayed medical treatment. He was arrested while attending the burial that March of Hajji Musa Mohammed Nur, director of an Islamic school. Freedom in the World rated Eritrea &quot;not free&quot; in 2022; the country scored one out of 40 for political rights and two out of 60 for civil liberties.

=== Foreign relations ===
==== Ethiopia ====

During the Ethiopian Civil War, the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front (TPLF) was initially inspired by the Eritreans and received assistance for their independence. By the 1980s and 1990s, the TPLF emerged as a powerful rebel group that increased its military skills in the revolutionary struggle. The groups disagreed and broke up in 1985.

Eritrea has engaged in border conflicts since its independence, most notably a war between 1998 and 2000. The war began after Eritrea invaded Ethiopia over the disputed border of Badme on 6 May 1998, and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths within two years. On 12 December 2000, Eritrea signed the Algiers Agreement to end the war; however, the countries remained in a &quot;no-war-no-peace&quot; stalemate. Eritrea has security concerns about Ethiopia, particularly its support of weak, splintered Eritrean opposition groups. Isaias uses the disputed border to maintain a war footing and justify indefinite mass mobilization and repression. Eritrea supported Ethiopian rebel groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) and the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) to undermine regional Ethiopian influence. In Somalia, Eritrea has trained, armed, and financed militias opposed to the Ethiopian government during its transitional government. The UN Monitoring Group on Somalia recommended an embargo against Eritrea, Ethiopia and other states.

In late 2008, the relationship between the countries was deemed strained; the Ethiopian Border Commission (EEBC) did not outline the border in November 2007. The United Nations Missions in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) ended in 2008, and Eritrean troops briefly occupied the Temporary Security Zone. Ethiopia remained in control of the EEBC&#x27;s border inside Eritrea and reached Badme, triggering mass mobilization and high troop concentrations in the area. Eritrea&#x27;s unchanged stance reinforced the EEBC&#x27;S decision, which was backed by international law; Ethiopia remained in &quot;de facto&quot; compliance and had strong relations with the UN.In 2018, Isaias oversaw an unexpected transformation of Eritrea&#x27;s relations with Ethiopia. The 20-year stalemate ended after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. Abiy signed a &quot;joint declaration of peace and friendship&quot; at a bilateral summit on 9 July, restoring diplomatic and trade ties with Eritrea. The agreement includes reopening Burre to access the landlocked Ethiopian Port of Eritrea and Zalambessa for trade, and access to Ethio telecom and Ethiopian Airlines. On 16 September, Abiy signed another peace treaty with Isaias in Jeddah. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir tweeted that the agreement &quot;will contribute to strengthening security and stability in the region at large&quot;. This was widely acknowledged by numerous world leaders, with the UAE Government awarding Isaias the Order of Zayed (First Class) in recognition of his efforts to end the conflict.

After July 2018, the Ethiopian and Eritrean intelligence agencies started a close cooperation. This worried Eritrean refugees in Addis Ababa, some of whom were temporarily detained for three weeks, acquitted by Ethiopian courts, and only released two weeks after their acquittal.

The Tigray war began on 3 November 2020 after the Tigray People&#x27;s Liberation Front, the former ruling party in Ethiopia, attacked the Northern Command center camps of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) in Tigray and pushed them to Eritrea. The Eritrean Defence Forces joined hands with the ENDF and allegedly with the help of UAE armed drones counter-attacked the TPLF forces. There was alleged looting in Tigray Region, including systematic, wide-scale looting in Axum following the Axum massacre in late November 2020. After several weeks of Ethiopian government denial of the presence of Eritrean troops in Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Prime Minister admitted to the presence of Eritrean troops in Ethiopia and agreed to withdraw them. Under international pressure, on 26 March 2021, after a meeting between Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Isaias, it was announced that Eritrean troops would withdraw from the Tigray Region.

==== Sudan ====

Relations between Eritrea and Sudan were initially hostile; shortly after independence in 1993, Eritrea charged Sudan with supporting the activities of Eritrean Islamic Jihad, which carried out attacks against the Eritrean government. Eritrea broke relations with Sudan at the end of 1994, became a strong supporter of the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Movement/Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA), and permitted the opposition National Democratic Alliance to locate its headquarters in the former Sudan embassy in Asmara.

Relations were later reestablished in December 2005. A year later, Isaias and Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir met for the first time since 2001 in Khartoum. Isaias later described relations with Sudan as resting on solid ground and having &quot;bright prospects.&quot; Eritrea played a prominent role in brokering a peace agreement between the Sudanese government and Sudan&#x27;s Eastern Front.

On 10 May 2014, the state-owned Sudan News Agency announced during Isaias&#x27; visit to the Al Jeili oil refinery that Sudan had agreed to supply Eritrea with fuel and boost its economic partnership. It was also reported that the Sudanese Electricity Company planned to supply a power line from Kassala to the Eritrean town of Teseney. On 4 May 2021, Isaias visited Khartoum to discuss the ongoing border dispute between Ethiopia and Sudan. In conversation with Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan, head of Sudan&#x27;s Transitional Sovereignty Council, he raised regional issues and the long-time dispute over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.

==== Djibouti ====

Relations between Eritrea and Djibouti date back to 1991. The countries waged war in April 1996 when Djibouti accused Eritrea of shelling Ras Doumeira, a small village bounded by Ethiopia&#x27;s Afar Region. Eritrea was also accused of redrawing the map of the area. Eritrea denied both claims. The conflict worsened until May 1996, when Eritrean forces retreated from the area and Djibouti retracted the allegations. The Eritrean–Ethiopian War was a threat to and an opportunity for Djibouti. Ethiopia diverted trade through Djibouti via Eritrean ports, strengthening economic ties in accordance with the 1996 protocol. In 1999, Djibouti and Ethiopia signed a military cooperation agreement.

In 1998, Eritrea accused Djibouti of using its port to supply military equipment to Ethiopia. In June of that year, Djibouti deployed military force in the north to avoid an incursion during the war; French troops were involved with their Djiboutian counterparts. In 1999, France sent two frigates to guard against any approaches toward Ethiopia and Eritrea. Djiboutian President Hassan Gouled Aptidon&#x27;s November 1998 attempt to mediate the Eritrean–Ethiopian War during the Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit was rejected by Eritrea for perceived partiality. Djibouti expelled its Eritrean ambassadors and Tekest Ghebrai, an Eritrean national and the former executive secretary of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), was dismissed.

The December 1997 treaty was deemed too weak. Eritrea accused Djibouti of siding with Ethiopia in 1999, and Djibouti accused Eritrea of supporting Djiboutian rebel groups in the Ras Doumeira area; Eritrea denied this. Rapprochement between the countries returned in March 2000, after mediation by Libya. Isaias visited Djibouti in 2001, and President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh visited Eritrea. This visit created a joint cooperative commission which would conduct an annual review. Guelleh sought a friendly relationship with Eritrea, despite their military imbalance.

Guelleh visited the disputed area on 22 April 2008, and the Djiboutian Foreign Ministry said that the Eritrean position lay several kilometers inside Djiboutian territory. Eritrea denied an accusation that its soldiers had dug trenches, and military officials met two days later to compare the border map. Djibouti sent troops to the area. Guelleh said on 9 May that the &quot;two armies are facing each other&quot;; the situation was explosive, with hostile forces ready to dismantle Djiboutian sovereignty. With reported Qatari mediation, both sides agreed to resolve the confrontation by negotiation.

==== Somalia ====
In July 2018, Eritrea and Somalia established diplomatic relations. On 28 July, Somalian president Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed began a three-day visit with Isaias in Asmara during which Somalia expressed solidarity with Eritrea in diplomacy and international politics.

==== Russia ====

Along with Belarus, Syria, and North Korea, Eritrea was one of only four countries not including Russia to vote against a United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In July 2023, Isaias attended the Russia–Africa Summit in Saint Petersburg and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. During the meeting with Putin, Isaias openly denied the existence of a war between Russia and Ukraine.

=== Forto incident ===

About 100 soldiers broke into Forto, the building housing the information-ministry correspondent for state television Eri-TV, on 21 January 2013 and surrounded the staff. They forced station director Asmelash Abraha to read a demand to release all prisoners of conscience and political prisoners and to implement the 1997 constitution. After he read two sentences, the station went off the air. Isaias&#x27; bodyguards were urged to protect him, his palace, and his airport. Eri-TV returned to the air at 10 a.m. to report a snowstorm in Paris. The mutiny subsided after the government negotiated the release of the ministry&#x27;s employees.

==Personal life==
In the summer of 1981, Isaias met his wife, former EPLF fighter Saba Haile, in a village called Nakfa. As of 2010 they had three children: Abraham, Elsa, and Berhane.

Shortly before Eritrea declared independence, Isaias contracted cerebral malaria and was flown to Israel for treatment. Arriving in a coma, he was treated at Sheba Medical Center, where he recovered after successful treatment. As of 2019, he was a member of the Eritrean Orthodox Church, one of the four legal churches in Eritrea.

His nickname &quot;Isu&quot; was frequently used in conversation, and to refer to Isaias in his political capacity, and has appeared in news articles as well.

His training in China made him a great admirer of Mao Zedong, but he reportedly hates Deng Xiaoping.

=== Temperament ===
In a 2008 leaked assessment, United States ambassador Ronald McMullen described Isaias as &quot;paranoid&quot; and believing that &quot;Ethiopian PM Meles Zenawi tried to kill him and that the United States will attempt to assassinate him.&quot;

==Foreign honours==
** Order of King Abdulaziz (16 September 2018)
** Order of the Republic of Serbia, Second Class (2016)
** Order of Zayed, First Class (24 July 2018)

<text>Girma Wolde-Giorgis (; 28 December 1924 – 15 December 2018) was an Ethiopian politician who was the president of Ethiopia from 2001 to 2013. He was the second person to hold the office of president since the founding of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in 1995.

== Early life ==
Girma was born on 28 December 1924 in Addis Ababa. He first attended an Ethiopian Orthodox Church school and later joined the Teferi Mekonnen School in Addis Ababa where he followed his education until the Italian invasion. The school was then renamed Scuola Principe di Piemonte (Prince of Piedmonte School) for the Crown Prince of Italy.

Between 1950 and 1952, he received certificates in management (from the Netherlands), in air traffic management (in Sweden) and air traffic control (in Canada) under a training programme sponsored by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). He was one of the first Ethiopians in the Ethiopian Air Force, which had been dominated by American technicians. Girma tried to motivate Ethiopians to join the airlines and wrote a book on fundamentals. He was an activist and at the Inter Parliamentary Summit in Yugoslavia, he condemned the apartheid system in South Africa. Girma spoke Afan Oromo (Oromiffa), Amharic, and English fluently.

== Political career ==

Girma was elected president on 8 October 2001, as a relatively unknown and a surprising choice, by a unanimous vote of the Ethiopian Parliament. The Ethiopian presidency is largely a symbolic office with little power. Most of the power is vested in the hands of the prime minister. Presidents serve two six-year terms. He was re-elected as president on 9 October 2007.

== Personal life ==

He was married and had five children. He was a member of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. He was widely renowned for his usual presence at Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Meskel Demera Festivals.

Girma died of natural causes on 15 December 2018, 13 days before his 94th birthday.

Two days before Ethiopian Christmas, on 5 January 2014 he made a clear statement on Ethiopia TV, calling for pacification between Ethiopia and Eritrea, calling it his last personal task and fight. He is coordinating from his office a group of people trying to launch peace talks, after fifteen years of disagreements, culminating in the Eritrean–Ethiopian War of 1998–2000.
