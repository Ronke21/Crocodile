<text>Waseda University (Japanese: ), abbreviated as &#x27; or &#x27;, is a private research university in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Founded in 1882 as the Tōkyō Professional School by Ōkuma Shigenobu, the fifth prime minister of Japan, the school was formally renamed Waseda University in 1902.

Waseda is organized into 36 departments: 13 undergraduate schools and 23 graduate schools. As of 2023, there are 38,776 undergraduate students and 8,490 graduate students. In addition to a central campus in Shinjuku (Waseda Campus and Nishiwaseda Campus), the university operates campuses in Chūō, Nishitōkyō, Tokorozawa, Honjō, and Kitakyūshū. Waseda also operates 21 research institutes at its main Shinjuku campus.

The university is selected as one of the Top Type (Type A) universities under MEXT&#x27;s Top Global University Project.

The university&#x27;s faculty and alumni include eight prime ministers of Japan; three prime ministers of Korea; a number of important figures of Japanese literature, including Haruki Murakami; founders of leading Japanese and Korean companies such as Samsung, Sony, Ito En, Lotte, CJ Group, POSCO; and many CEOs, including Japan&#x27;s richest person, Tadashi Yanai.

==History==

Waseda was founded as &#x27; on 21 October 1882 by samurai scholar and Meiji-era politician and former prime minister Ōkuma Shigenobu. Before the name &#x27;Waseda&#x27; was selected, it was known variously as &#x27; or &#x27; after the location of the founder&#x27;s villa in Waseda Village and the school&#x27;s location in Totsuka Village, respectively. It was renamed &#x27; on 2 September 1902, upon acquiring university status. It started as a college with three departments under the old Japanese system of higher education.

In 1882, the university had the department of political science and economics, law, and physical science. Along with these departments, an English language course was established, where the students of all the departments could learn English. Three years later, the department of physical science was closed because it had too few applicants.

The department of literature was established in 1890, the department of education in 1903, the department of commerce in 1904, and the department of science and engineering in 1908.

Although Waseda formally adopted the term university in its title in 1902 it was not until 1920 that, along with other private schools and colleges, it received formal government recognition as a university under the terms of the University Establishment Ordinance. Thus Waseda became, with Keio University, the first private university in Japan.

Much of the campus was destroyed in the fire bombings of Tokyo during World War II, but the university was rebuilt and reopened by 1949. It has grown to become a comprehensive university with two senior high schools and school of art and architecture.

On 12 June 1950, sixty police raided Waseda University and seized copies of a Communist-inspired open letter to General MacArthur. The open letter to MacArthur was once read at a Communist-sponsored rally a week earlier. The letter demanded a peace treaty for Japan that would include Russia and Communist China, withdrawal of occupation forces, and the release of eight Japanese sent to prison for assaulting five U.S. soldiers at a Communist rally. A police official said most Waseda meetings would be banned in the future because &quot;political elements&quot; might try to utilize them. Yuichi Eshima, Vice-chairman of the Students Autonomy Society, said the police action &quot;stupefied&quot; students and professors, and that &quot;This is worse than the prewar peace preservation measures.&quot;

In 1993, President of the United States Bill Clinton visited Waseda University and mentioned that the university is a center of academic excellence and a training ground for Japan&#x27;s distinguished leaders.

===Academic cap===
Ōkuma had long desired to create an academic cap so distinctive that someone wearing the cap would immediately be identified as a Waseda student. The chief tailor of Takashimaya, Yashichiro, was called upon to design a cap in three days.
Each square cap was stamped on the inside with the student&#x27;s name, his department, the school seal and the legend, &quot;This certifies that the owner is a student of Waseda&quot;. Thus, the cap served as a form of identification, and effectively a status symbol. The cap, with its gold-braided badge, is registered as a trademark.

===Anniversary===

On 21 October 2007, Waseda University celebrated its 125th anniversary. Ōkuma often talked about the &quot;125 years of life&quot; theory: &quot;The lifespan of a human being can be as long as 125 years. He will be able to live out his natural lifespan as long as he takes proper care of his health&quot;, because &quot;physiologists say that every animal has the ability to live five times as long as its growth period. Since a man is said to require about 25 years to become fully mature, it follows that he can live up to 125 years of age.&quot; This theory propounded by Ōkuma was very popular and often referred to in the media of the time.

In commemorative events relating to Waseda University and Ōkuma, the number 125 is accorded special significance, as it marks an important epoch. The tower of Ōkuma Auditorium, completed on the university&#x27;s 45th anniversary, is 125 &quot;shaku&quot;, or about 38 m high. In 1963, there were also events to mark the 125th anniversary of Ōkuma Shigenobu&#x27;s birth.

Ōkuma, who twice served as prime minister of Japan, organized his second cabinet when he was 77 and died when he was 83. He said, &quot;I wish I had understood this &#x27;125 years of life&#x27; theory 30 years earlier&quot;. He did, however, lead a regular life, and lived fairly long compared to other Japanese at the time.

One of the prominent libraries established at the end of the Taishō period, it has been a symbol of Waseda University to this day, along with the Okuma Auditorium and the Theatre Museum. The Old Library and the administration building were expanded in 1934 and 1955, respectively. After the New Central Library, the Old Library stopped serving as a main library, located where the Abe Stadium used to be, was completed in 1990. It now houses Takata Sanae Memorial Research Library, the University Archives, and Aizu Yaichi Museum. Takata Sanae Memorial Research Library opened in 1994.

It is painted on the world&#x27;s largest hand-made washi (Japanese paper), which is 4.45 meters in diameter and weighs about 12 kilograms. It was manufactured by Iwano Heisaburō, the founder of the Echizen paper works in Imadachi-cho, Fukui prefecture. The masterpiece was painted free of charge by Yokoyama Taikan and Shimomura Kanzan, two artists who represented the modern Japanese style of painting. President Takata Sanae asked them to paint a picture for the Library. The library possesses a unique collection which survived the Bombing of Tokyo in World War II unlike many of its counterparts.

<doc id="376795" wikidata="Q1050437" url="?curid=376795" title="Flex (lexical analyser generator)">
<text>Flex (fast lexical analyzer generator) is a free and open-source software alternative to lex. 
It is a computer program that generates lexical analyzers (also known as &quot;scanners&quot; or &quot;lexers&quot;).
It is frequently used as the lex implementation together with Berkeley Yacc parser generator on BSD-derived operating systems (as both codice_1 and codice_2 are part of POSIX), or together with GNU bison (a version of yacc) in *BSD ports and in Linux distributions. Unlike Bison, flex is not part of the GNU Project and is not released under the GNU General Public License, although a manual for Flex was produced and published by the Free Software Foundation.

==History==
Flex was written in C around 1987 by Vern Paxson, with the help of many ideas and much inspiration from Van Jacobson. Original version by Jef Poskanzer. The fast table representation is a partial implementation of a design done by Van Jacobson. The implementation was done by Kevin Gong and Vern Paxson.

== Example lexical analyzer ==
This is an example of a Flex scanner for the instructional programming language PL/0.

The tokens recognized are: &#x27;codice_3&#x27;, &#x27;codice_4&#x27;, &#x27;codice_5&#x27;, &#x27;codice_6&#x27;, &#x27;codice_7&#x27;, &#x27;codice_8&#x27;, &#x27;codice_9&#x27;, &#x27;codice_10&#x27;, &#x27;codice_11&#x27;, &#x27;codice_12&#x27;, &#x27;codice_13&#x27;, &#x27;codice_14&#x27;, &#x27;codice_15&#x27;, &#x27;codice_16&#x27;, &#x27;codice_17&#x27;, &#x27;codice_18&#x27;;
numbers: codice_19; identifiers: codice_20 and keywords: codice_21, codice_22, codice_23, codice_24, codice_25, codice_26, codice_27, codice_28, codice_29, codice_30, codice_31.

==Internals==

These programs perform character parsing and tokenizing via the use of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). A DFA is a theoretical machine accepting regular languages. These machines are a subset of the collection of Turing machines. DFAs are equivalent to read-only right moving Turing machines. The syntax is based on the use of regular expressions. See also nondeterministic finite automaton.

== Issues ==

=== Time complexity ===
A Flex lexical analyzer usually has time complexity formula_1 in the length of the input. That is, it performs a constant number of operations for each input symbol. This constant is quite low: GCC generates 12 instructions for the DFA match loop. Note that the constant is independent of the length of the token, the length of the regular expression and the size of the DFA.

However, using the REJECT macro in a scanner with the potential to match extremely long tokens can cause Flex to generate a scanner with non-linear performance. This feature is optional. In this case, the programmer has explicitly told Flex to &quot;go back and try again&quot; after it has already matched some input. This will cause the DFA to backtrack to find other accept states. The REJECT feature is not enabled by default, and because of its performance implications its use is discouraged in the Flex manual.

=== Reentrancy ===
By default the scanner generated by Flex is not reentrant. This can cause serious problems for programs that use the generated scanner from different threads. To overcome this issue there are options that Flex provides in order to achieve reentrancy. A detailed description of these options can be found in the Flex manual.

=== Usage under non-Unix environments ===
Normally the generated scanner contains references to the &quot;unistd.h&quot; header file, which is Unix specific. To avoid generating code that includes &quot;unistd.h&quot;, &quot;%option nounistd&quot; should be used. Another issue is the call to &quot;isatty&quot; (a Unix library function), which can be found in the generated code. The &quot;%option never-interactive&quot; forces flex to generate code that does not use &quot;isatty&quot;.

===Using flex from other languages===
Flex can only generate code for C and C++. To use the scanner code generated by flex from other languages a language binding tool such as SWIG can be used.

=== Unicode support ===
Flex is limited to matching 1-byte (8-bit) binary values and therefore does not support Unicode. RE/flex and other alternatives do support Unicode matching.

==Flex++==

flex++ is a similar lexical scanner for C++ which is included as part of the flex package. The generated code does not depend on any runtime or external library except for a memory allocator (malloc or a user-supplied alternative) unless the input also depends on it. This can be useful in embedded and similar situations where traditional operating system or C runtime facilities may not be available.

The flex++ generated C++ scanner includes the header file codice_32, which defines the interfaces of the two C++ generated classes.

<text>In computer programming, a shim is a library that transparently intercepts API calls and changes the arguments passed, handles the operation itself or redirects the operation elsewhere. Shims can be used to support an old API in a newer environment, or a new API in an older environment. Shims can also be used for running programs on different software platforms than they were developed for.

Shims for older APIs typically come about when the behavior of an API changes, thereby causing compatibility issues for older applications which still rely on the older functionality; in such cases, the older API can still be supported by a thin compatibility layer on top of the newer code. Shims for newer APIs are defined as: &quot;a library that brings a new API to an older environment, using only the means of that environment.&quot;

== Examples ==
* Web polyfills implement newer web standards using older standards and JavaScript, if the newer standard is not available in a given web browser.
* Support of AppleTalk on Macintosh computers, during the brief period in which Apple Computer supported the Open Transport networking system. Thousands of Mac programs were based on the AppleTalk protocol; to support these programs, AppleTalk was re-implemented as an OpenTransport &quot;stack&quot;, and then re-implemented as an API shim on top of this new library.
* The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) uses the term to mean backward compatible libraries. Shims simulate the behavior of older versions of Windows for legacy applications that rely on incorrect or deprecated functionality, or correct the way in which poorly written applications call unchanged APIs, for example to fix least-privileged user account (LUA) bugs.
* bind.so is a shim library for Linux that allows any application, regardless of permissions, to bind to a listening socket or specify outgoing IP address. It uses the LD_PRELOAD mechanism, which allows shims and other libraries to be loaded into any program.
* In the &quot;type tunnel&quot; pattern, a generic interface layer uses a family of shims to translate a heterogeneous set of types to a single primitive type used by an underlying API.

<text>In physics, critical phenomena is the collective name associated with the
physics of critical points. Most of them stem from the divergence of the 
correlation length, but also the dynamics slows down. Critical phenomena include scaling relations among different quantities, power-law divergences of some quantities (such as the magnetic susceptibility in the ferromagnetic phase transition) described by critical exponents, universality, fractal behaviour, and ergodicity breaking. Critical phenomena take place in second order phase transitions, although not exclusively.

The critical behavior is usually different from the mean-field approximation which is valid away from the phase transition, since the latter neglects correlations, which become increasingly important as the system approaches the critical point where the correlation length diverges. Many properties of the critical behavior of a system can be derived in the framework of the renormalization group.

In order to explain the physical origin of these phenomena, we shall use the Ising model as a pedagogical example.

==Critical point of the 2D Ising model==

Consider a formula_1 square array of classical spins which may only take two positions: +1 and −1, at a certain temperature formula_2, interacting through the Ising classical Hamiltonian:

: formula_3

where the sum is extended over the pairs of nearest neighbours and formula_4 is a coupling constant, which we will consider to be fixed. There is a certain temperature, called the Curie temperature or critical temperature, formula_5 below which the system presents ferromagnetic long range order. Above it, it is paramagnetic and is apparently disordered.

At temperature zero, the system may only take one global sign, either +1 or -1. At higher temperatures, but below formula_5, the state is still globally magnetized, but clusters of the opposite sign appear. As the temperature increases, these clusters start to contain smaller clusters themselves, in a typical Russian dolls picture. Their typical size, called the correlation length, formula_7 grows with temperature until it diverges at formula_5. This means that the whole system is such a cluster, and there is no global magnetization. Above that temperature, the system is globally disordered, but with ordered clusters within it, whose size is again called &quot;correlation length&quot;, but it is now decreasing with temperature. At infinite temperature, it is again zero, with the system fully disordered.

==Divergences at the critical point==

The correlation length diverges at the critical point: as formula_9, formula_10. This divergence poses no physical problem. Other physical observables diverge at this point, leading to some confusion at the beginning.

The most important is susceptibility. Let us apply a very small magnetic field to the
system in the critical point. A very small magnetic field is not able to magnetize a large coherent cluster, but with these fractal clusters the picture changes. It affects easily the smallest size clusters, since they have a nearly paramagnetic behaviour. But this change, in its turn, affects the next-scale clusters, and the perturbation climbs the ladder until the whole system changes radically. Thus, critical systems are very sensitive to small changes in the environment.

Other observables, such as the specific heat, may also diverge at this point. All these divergences stem from that of the correlation length.

==Critical exponents and universality==

As we approach the critical point, these diverging observables behave as formula_11 for some exponent formula_12 where, typically, the value of the exponent α is the same above and below Tc. These exponents are called critical exponents and are robust observables. Even more, they take the same values for very different physical systems. This intriguing phenomenon, called universality, is explained, qualitatively and also quantitatively, by the renormalization group.

==Critical dynamics==
Critical phenomena may also appear for &quot;dynamic&quot; quantities, not only for &quot;static&quot; ones. In fact, the divergence of the characteristic &quot;time&quot; formula_13 of a system is directly related to the divergence of the thermal &quot;correlation length&quot; formula_14 by the introduction of a dynamical exponent &quot;z&quot; and the relation formula_15 . The voluminous &quot;static universality class&quot; of a system splits into different, less voluminous &quot;dynamic universality classes&quot; with different values of &quot;z&quot;
but a common static critical behaviour, and by approaching the critical point one may observe all kinds of slowing-down phenomena. The divergence of relaxation time formula_16 at criticality leads to singularities in various collective transport quantities, e.g., the interdiffusivity, shear viscosity formula_17, and bulk viscosity formula_18. The dynamic critical exponents follow certain scaling relations, viz., formula_19, where d is the space dimension. There is only one independent dynamic critical exponent. Values of these exponents are dictated by several universality classes. According to the Hohenberg−Halperin nomenclature, for the model H universality class (fluids) formula_20.

==Ergodicity breaking==

Ergodicity is the assumption that a system, at a given temperature, explores the full phase space, just each state takes different probabilities. In an Ising ferromagnet below formula_5 this does not happen. If formula_22, never mind how close they are, the system has chosen a global magnetization, and the phase space is divided into two regions. From one of them it is impossible to reach the other, unless a magnetic field is applied, or temperature is raised above formula_5.

==Mathematical tools==

The main mathematical tools to study critical points are renormalization group, which takes advantage of the Russian dolls picture or the self-similarity to explain universality and predict numerically the critical exponents, and variational perturbation theory, which converts divergent perturbation expansions into convergent strong-coupling expansions relevant to critical phenomena. In two-dimensional systems, conformal field theory is a powerful tool which has discovered many new properties of 2D critical systems, employing the fact that scale invariance, along with a few other requisites, leads to an infinite symmetry group.

==Critical point in renormalization group theory==
The critical point is described by a conformal field theory. According to the renormalization group theory, the defining property of criticality is that the characteristic length scale of the structure of the physical system, also known as the correlation length &quot;ξ&quot;, becomes infinite. This can happen along &quot;critical lines&quot; in phase space. This effect is the cause of the critical opalescence that can be observed as a binary fluid mixture approaches its liquid–liquid critical point.

In systems in equilibrium, the critical point is reached only by precisely tuning a control parameter. However, in some non-equilibrium systems, the critical point is an attractor of the dynamics in a manner that is robust with respect to system parameters, a phenomenon referred to as self-organized criticality.

==Applications==
Applications arise in physics and chemistry, but also in fields such as sociology. For example, it is natural to describe a system of two political parties by an Ising model. Thereby, at a transition from one majority to the other, the above-mentioned critical phenomena may appear.

<text>Open Transport was the name given by Apple Inc. to its implementation of the Unix-originated System V STREAMS networking stack. Based on code licensed from Mentat&#x27;s Portable Streams product, Open Transport was built to provide the classic Mac OS with a modern TCP/IP implementation, replacing MacTCP. Apple also added its own implementation of AppleTalk to the stack to support legacy networks.

==History==

===STREAMS===
Prior to the release of Open Transport, the classic Mac OS used a variety of stand-alone INITs to provide networking functionality. The only one that was widely used throughout the OS was the AppleTalk system. Among the other protocol stacks supported, MacTCP was becoming increasingly important as the Internet boom started to gain momentum. MacTCP emulated the Berkeley sockets system, widely used among Unix-like operating systems.

MacTCP and the previous generation AppleTalk library were slow on PowerPC-based Macintoshes because they were written for previous generation 680x0-based Macintoshes and therefore ran under emulation on PowerPC-based machines. MacTCP was also lacking in features, however, and a major upgrade was clearly needed if Apple was to keep its hand in the Internet market.

Through the late 1980s several major efforts to re-combine the many Unix derivatives into a single system were underway, and the most significant among these was the AT&amp;T-led System V. System V included an entirely new networking stack, STREAMS, replacing the existing Berkeley sockets system. STREAMS had a number of advantages over sockets, including the ability to support multiple networking stacks at the same time, the ability to plug in modules into the middle of existing stacks to provide simple mechanisms for filtering and similar duties, while offering a single application programming interface to the user programs. At the time it appeared STREAMS would become the &quot;de facto&quot; standard.

This change in the market led Apple to move to support STREAMS as well. It also presented two practical advantages to the company; STREAMS&#x27; multiprotocol support would allow them to support both TCP/IP and AppleTalk from a single interface, and a portable cross-platform version of STREAMS was available for purchase commercially, one that included a high-quality TCP implementation. Using STREAMS also appeared to offer a way to &quot;one up&quot; Microsoft, whose own TCP/IP networking system, Winsock, was based on the apparently soon-to-be-obsolete sockets.

===OT===
Open Transport was introduced in May 1995 with the Power Mac 9500. It was included with System 7.5.2, a release for the new PCI based Power Macs, and became available for older hardware later. MacTCP was not supported on PCI-based Macs, but older systems could switch between MacTCP and Open Transport using a Control Panel called Network Software Selector. Unlike MacTCP, Open Transport enabled users to save and switch between configuration sets.

Developer opinion on Open Transport was divided. Some felt it offered enormous speed improvements over MacTCP. Some developers also liked it because it was flexible in the way it allowed protocols to be &quot;stacked&quot; to apply filters and other such duties. However, the system was also large and complex. The flexibility of the Open Transport architecture, into which one could plug any desired protocol, was felt by some to be thoroughly overcomplicated. Additionally, most Unix code still used sockets, not STREAMS, and so MacTCP offered real advantages in terms of porting software to the Mac.

The vaunted flexibility of the Open Transport architecture was undermined and ultimately made obsolete by the rapid rise of TCP/IP networking during the mid-90s. The same is true in the wider Unix market; System V was undermined by the rapid rise of free Unix-like systems, notably Linux. As these systems grew in popularity, the vast majority of programmers ignored the closed STREAMS in favour of the BSD-licensed Sockets. Open Transport was abandoned during the move to OS X, which, being derived from BSD, had a networking stack based entirely on sockets.

Open Transport received deprecation status from in OS X 10.4 and its SDKs. Support was removed entirely from OS X in version 10.9 (Mavericks).

<doc id="376813" wikidata="Q2655795" url="?curid=376813" title="British–Irish Council">
<text>The British–Irish Council (BIC; ) is an intergovernmental organisation that aims to improve collaboration between its members in a number of areas including transport, the environment and energy. Its membership comprises Ireland, the United Kingdom, the devolved governments of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, in addition to the governments of the British Crown Dependencies: Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man. As England does not have a devolved administration, it is not individually represented on the council but only as a member of the United Kingdom.

The British and Irish governments, and political parties in Northern Ireland, agreed to form a council under the British–Irish Agreement, part of the Good Friday Agreement reached in 1998. The council was formally established on 2 December 1999, when the Agreement came into effect. The council&#x27;s stated aim is to &quot;promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands&quot;. The BIC has a standing secretariat, located in Edinburgh, Scotland; it meets in semi-annual summits and more frequent ministerial meetings.

==Background==

The British–Irish Council was established on 10 April 1998 following two years worth of negotiations between the UK and Irish Governments alongside the political parties in Northern Ireland on the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, a political organisation was to be established in order to foster and provide opportunities to greater integral working between both the UK and Irish governments, and later the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Multi-Party agreement between both the UK and Irish governments formally came into effect on 2 December 1999.

Since its formation, the heads of governments of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey have met biannually during the Heads of Administrations summit. The first meeting of the British–Irish council took place on 17 December 1999. The first meeting was hosted by the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Tony Blair in London.

In 2006, the St. Andrews Agreement was signed in order to establish a standing permanent Secretariat to the British–Irish Council. The establishment of the position was designed to &quot;further the British-Irish Council work&quot;. The Permanent Secretariat was established six years later, located in the capital city of Scotland, Edinburgh following an agreement between council members at the summit in 2010 hosted by Guernsey that the Scottish Government would be the Permanent Secretariat host. The Secretariat was formally established in January 2012.

In 2023, the summits held in Jersey and the Republic of Ireland marked twenty-five years since the Good Friday Agreement, whilst the 42nd summit hosted by Scotland in December 2024 marked twenty-five years since the inaugural meeting of the council.

==Overview and structure==
The nine heads of government meet at summits twice per year. Additionally, there are regular meetings that deal with specific sectors which are attended by the corresponding ministers. Representatives of members operate in accordance with whatever procedures for democratic authority and accountability are in force in their respective elected legislatures.

England, unlike the other countries of the United Kingdom, is not represented separately, as it does not have its own devolved administration. It is thus solely represented on the council as part of the United Kingdom. Although Cornwall technically holds observer status on the Council due to its language, it is also represented by the UK government.

The work of the council is financed by members through mutual agreement as required. At the ninth meeting of the Council in July 2007 it was decided that with devolved government returned to Northern Ireland that an opportune time existed &quot;to undertake a strategic review of the Council&#x27;s work programmes, working methods and support arrangements.&quot; This decision included the potential for a permanent standing secretariat, which was established in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 4 January 2012.

At its June 2010 summit, the Council decided to move forward on recommendations to enhance the relationship between it and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly (BIPA). The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly is made up of members from the parliaments and assemblies of the same states and regions as the members of the British–Irish Council. The Council tasked its secretariat with moving this work forward in conjunction with the BIPA&#x27;s secretariat.

== Work areas ==
The Council agrees to specific work areas for which individual members take responsibility. The Belfast Agreement suggested transport links, agriculture, environmental issues, culture, health, education and approaches to the European Union as suitable topics for early discussion. However, these work areas can be expanded or reduced as the Council decides. It is also open to the council to make agreement on common policies. These agreements are made through consensus, although individual members may opt not to participate in implementing any of these.

The current list of work areas and the member responsible are:

* Collaborative spatial planning (Northern Ireland)
* Demography (Scotland)
* Digital inclusion (Isle of Man)
* Early years policy (Wales)
* Energy (United Kingdom – Electricity Grids, and Scotland – Marine)
* Environment (United Kingdom)
* Housing (Northern Ireland)
* Indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages (Wales)
* Misuse of Substances (drugs and alcohol) (Ireland)
* Social inclusion (Scotland and Wales)
* Transport (Northern Ireland)
* Creative Industries (Jersey)
Demography was adopted as a work area at the 2006 meeting of the council. It was proposed by the Scottish Executive, who also took responsibility for it. During the 2007 meeting of the council the Scottish Government further proposed that energy become a work area of the council. Past work sector areas included knowledge economy, e-health / telemedicine and tourism.

== Membership and operation ==

===Members and advisors===


===Current leaders===

Membership of the Council consists of the following administrations (with current heads of administrations as of 2025):

==Name of the Council==

Initial suggestions for the council included the names &quot;Council of the British Isles&quot; or &quot;Council of the Isles&quot;, and the council has sometimes been known by the latter name. However, owing to sensitivities around the term &quot;British Isles&quot;, particularly in Ireland, the name &quot;British–Irish Council&quot; was agreed.

The official name of the council is represented in minority and lesser-used languages of the council as:
* 
* Guernésiais: 
* Jèrriais: 

* 
* Ulster-Scots:

<text>The Bailiwick of Guernsey (; Guernésiais: &quot;Bailliage dé Guernési&quot;) is a self-governing British Crown Dependency off the coast of Normandy, France, comprising several of the Channel Islands. It has a total land area of and an estimated total population of 67,334.

The Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of Normandy, whose dukes became kings of England from 1066. In 1204, as a consequence of the Treaty of Le Goulet, insular Normandy alone remained loyal to the English Crown, leading to a political split from the mainland. Around 1290, the Channel Islands&#x27; Governor, Otto de Grandson, split the archipelago into two bailiwicks, establishing those parts other than Jersey as a single Bailiwick of Guernsey.

The Bailiwick is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising three separate jurisdictions: Alderney, Guernsey (incorporating Herm), and Sark. The Lieutenant Governor is the representative of the British monarch, who remains the head of state. The States of Guernsey is the parliament and government of the whole Bailiwick, though several matters are decided locally by the States of Alderney and by Sark&#x27;s Chief Pleas. The Bailiff of Guernsey is the civil head of the Bailiwick, and is also president of the States of Guernsey and head of the Bailiwick&#x27;s judiciary.

The Bailiwick is self-governing and not part of the United Kingdom. Its defence and international representation — as well as certain policy areas, such as nationality law — are the responsibility of the UK Government, but the Bailiwick still has a separate international identity.

== History ==
The history of the Bailiwick of Guernsey goes back to 933, when the islands came under the control of William Longsword, having been annexed from the Duchy of Brittany by the Duchy of Normandy. The island of Guernsey and the other Channel Islands formed part of the lands of William the Conqueror. In 1204, France conquered mainland Normandy – but not the offshore islands of the bailiwick. The islands represent the last remnants of the medieval Duchy of Normandy.

Initially, there was one governor, or co-governors working together, of the islands making up the Channel Islands. The title &quot;governor&quot; has changed over the centuries. &quot;Warden&quot;, &quot;keeper&quot;, and &quot;captain&quot; have previously been used. The bailiff stands in for the Governor, or more recently the Lieutenant Governor, if the latter is absent, for a short term or for longer: for instance during the five years of the German occupation of the Channel Islands. The Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey is the Lieutenant Governor of the Bailiwick of Guernsey and, being the personal representative of the British monarch, has usually had a distinguished military service.

Originally, the local courts in Guernsey were &quot;fiefs&quot; with the lord of the manor presiding. Before 1066, a superior court was introduced above the &quot;fiefs&quot; and below the &quot;Eschequier&quot; Court in Rouen and comprised the bailiff and four knights; the court heard appeals and tried criminal cases.

Otton de Grandson, then the governor of the Islands, delegated the civil powers to two separate bailiffs for Guernsey and Jersey before he went on crusade to the Holy Land in 1290. This can be assessed as the date of first creation of the two bailiwicks.

== Geography ==
Situated around , Alderney, Guernsey, Herm, Sark, and some other smaller islands together have a total area of and coastlines of about . Elevation varies from sea level to at Le Moulin on Sark.

There are many smaller islands, islets, rocks and reefs in the Bailiwick. Combined with a tidal range of and fast currents of up to , sailing in local waters is dangerous.

== Constitutional status ==
The Bailiwick of Guernsey is a separate jurisdiction in itself and is, in turn, also three separate sub-jurisdictions. It does not form part of, and is separate from (but is not independent of, or from) the United Kingdom. The two Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey together make up the Channel Islands.

The islanders have never had formal representation in the House of Commons of the British Parliament, nor the European Parliament. Those islanders who were not somehow qualified and eligible &quot;in their own right&quot; to register to vote and to vote in the United Kingdom under the Representation of the People Acts as &quot;overseas voters&quot;, were excluded from the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.

Guernsey has an unwritten constitution arising from the Treaty of Paris (1259). When Henry III and the King of France came to terms over the Duchy of Normandy, the Norman mainland fell under the suzerainty of the king of France. The Channel Islands, however, remained loyal to the English crown due to the loyalties of its Seigneurs. However, they were never absorbed into the Kingdom of England by any Act of Union, but exist as &quot;peculiars of the Crown&quot;.

A unique constitutional position has arisen as successive British monarchs have confirmed the liberties and privileges of the Bailiwick, often referring to the so-called &quot;Constitutions of King John&quot;, a legendary document supposed to have been granted by King John in the aftermath of 1204. Governments of the Bailiwick have generally tried to avoid testing the limits of the unwritten constitution by avoiding conflict with British governments.

This peculiar political position has often been to the benefit of islanders. Until the 19th century, the Bailiwick was generally exempt from the harsher parts of Westminster legislation while being included in favourable policies, such as protectionist economic policies. England, and later the United Kingdom, passively exploited the strategic benefits of the Channel Islands. For example, the islands were a convenient stop-off point for trade to Gascony.

== Parishes ==

The bailiwick comprises twelve parishes: Alderney, Sark, and ten on mainland Guernsey (one of which includes Herm). Each parish has a parish church dating from the 11th century, with strong religious control exercised initially by the French Catholic church and for the last 500 years by the English church. Over the years, the religious aspect of the administration of each parish has been reduced in favour of democratically elected douzeniers.

== Jurisdictions ==
Each jurisdiction has inhabited and uninhabited islands and its own elected government. All three legal jurisdictions need royal assent from the Monarch on its primary legislation, but as of February 29, 2024, certain domestic primary legislation need only the Lieutenant-Governor&#x27;s assent. Each jurisdiction raises its own taxation, although in 1949 Alderney transferred its rights to Guernsey.

===Alderney===
With a population of around 2,200 in , Alderney has its own parliament, the States of Alderney, which has ten elected members and an elected president.

From 1612, Alderney had a judge appointed, with similar judicial powers to a bailiff, but on 1 January 1949, the island adopted a new constitution, giving up some independence, moving closer to Guernsey, and confirming that it is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey.

=== Guernsey ===
The island of Guernsey has a population of around 63,000 in and forms the legal and administrative centre of the Bailiwick of Guernsey. The parliament of Guernsey and the nearby inhabited islands of Herm, Jethou and Lihou is the States of Guernsey.

===Sark===
Sark has a population of around 600 who live in . Its parliament (together with the inhabited island of Brecqhou) is the Chief Pleas of Sark, with 18 elected members.

In 1565, Helier de Carteret, Seigneur of St. Ouen in Jersey, was granted the fief of Sark by Queen Elizabeth I. He received letters patent granting him Sark in perpetuity on condition that he kept the island free of pirates and that at least forty men occupied it to defend it. Despite most families coming from Jersey, Sark remained within the Bailiwick of Guernsey.

==Recognition==

There is no flag or coat of arms for the Bailiwick of Guernsey. In historic times, the governor would have used his personal symbols before a generic flag was created for use by the governor.

In 1279, Edward I granted a Seal for use in the Channel Islands. In 1304, separate seals were provided to Jersey and Guernsey. The provision of different seals is one of the earliest indications of the individual identity and personality of the two Bailiwicks. The seal comprised three leopards (or lions), a symbol taken from the original arms of the Duchy of Normandy.

The United Kingdom and His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the United Kingdom are responsible for the defence and also for &quot;formal&quot; international, intergovernmental, and consular representation of, and the foreign affairs generally, of the Bailiwick.

While never a member of the European Union or its predecessors, before Brexit the Bailiwick had a special relationship with the EU under Protocol 3 of the UK&#x27;s Treaty of Accession 1972 to the European Community. Pooling resources with Jersey, the Bailiwick established in 2010 an office in Brussels to develop the Channel Islands&#x27; influence with the EU, to advise the Channel Islands&#x27; governments on European matters, and to promote economic links with the EU.

The Bailiwick of Guernsey is in the Commonwealth (Commonwealth of Nations), although not as a &quot;member&quot;, &quot;in its own right&quot;. The Bailiwick is also a member of the Commonwealth Games Federation and competes in the Commonwealth Games.

In 1969, Royal Mail relinquished control of postal services in the Bailiwick, with Guernsey then being recognised by the Universal Postal Union.

Since 1999, the Bailiwick of Guernsey has been a member of the British–Irish Council, currently represented by the Chief Minister of Guernsey.

<text>The Northern Ireland Executive (Irish: &quot;Feidhmeannas Thuaisceart Éireann&quot;, Ulster Scots: &quot;Norlin Airlan Executive&quot;) is the devolved government of Northern Ireland, an administrative branch of the legislature – the Northern Ireland Assembly, situated in Belfast. It is answerable to the assembly and was initially established according to the terms of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which followed the Good Friday Agreement (or Belfast Agreement). The executive is referred to in the legislation as the Executive Committee of the assembly and is an example of consociationalist (&quot;power-sharing&quot;) government.

The Northern Ireland Executive consists of the First Minister and deputy First Minister and various ministers with individual portfolios and remits. The main assembly parties appoint most ministers in the executive, except for the Minister of Justice who is elected by a cross-community vote. It is one of three devolved governments in the United Kingdom, the others being the Scottish and Welsh governments.

In January 2017, Sinn Féin deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal and the Northern Ireland Executive consequently collapsed. The governing of Northern Ireland fell to the civil service in a caretaker capacity until January 2020, when the parties signed the New Decade, New Approach agreement and an Executive was subsequently established. When Democratic Unionist Party First Minister Paul Givan resigned in line with his party&#x27;s protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol, The Northern Ireland Executive collapsed again. No agreement on power-sharing was made after the 2022 Assembly election, and from October 2022 to February 2024, Northern Ireland was again governed by the civil service. On 3 February 2024, Sinn Féin&#x27;s Michelle O&#x27;Neill was appointed First Minister, the first Irish nationalist to be appointed to the position, with DUP&#x27;s Emma Little-Pengelly as deputy First Minister.

==Legal basis==
The Executive (and the Assembly) were established in law by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 that followed the Good Friday Agreement and its basis was revised by the Northern Ireland (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006 that followed the St Andrews Agreement of that year.

==Ministers==
On 9 May 2016, the number of ministries and departments of the Northern Ireland Executive was reduced, leaving the following departments:

* Executive Office
* Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs
* Minister for Communities
* Minister of Education
* Minister for the Economy
* Minister of Finance
* Minister of Health
* Minister for Infrastructure
* Minister of Justice
At the same time, various departments were renamed as follows: 
* Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister was renamed Executive Office
* Department of Agriculture and Rural Development was renamed Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs
* Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment was renamed Department for the Economy
* Department of Finance and Personnel was renamed Department of Finance
* Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety was renamed Department of Health
* Department for Regional Development was renamed Department for Infrastructure
* Department for Social Development was renamed Department for Communities

The following departments were dissolved:
* Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
* Department of the Environment 
* Department for Employment and Learning

==Structure==

In contrast with Westminster system cabinets, which generally need only be backed by a majority of legislators, ministerial positions in the Northern Ireland Executive are allocated to parties with significant representation in the Assembly. With the exception of justice, the number of ministries to which each party is entitled is determined by the D&#x27;Hondt system.

In effect, major parties cannot be excluded from participation in government and power-sharing is enforced by the system. The form of government is therefore known as &quot;mandatory coalition&quot; as opposed to &quot;voluntary coalition&quot; where parties negotiate an agreement to share power. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and some Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) members favour a move towards voluntary coalition in the longer term but this is currently opposed by Sinn Féin.

The executive cannot function if either of the two largest parties refuse to take part, as these parties are allocated the First Minister and deputy First Minister positions. However, other parties are not required to enter the executive even if they are entitled to do so; instead, they can choose to go into opposition if they wish. There were some calls for the SDLP and the UUP to enter opposition after the 2007 Assembly elections, but ultimately the two parties chose to take the seats in the Executive to which they were entitled.

In 2010, an exception to the D&#x27;Hondt system for allocating the number of ministerial portfolios was made under the Hillsborough Castle Agreement to allow the cross-community Alliance Party of Northern Ireland to hold the politically contentious policing and justice brief when most of those powers were devolved to the Assembly. Devolution took place on 12 April 2010.

Under D&#x27;Hondt, the SDLP would have been entitled to the extra ministerial seat on the revised Executive created by the devolution of policing and justice. Accordingly, both the UUP and SDLP protested that Alliance was not entitled, under the rules of the Good Friday Agreement, to fill the portfolio and refused to support this move. However, Alliance leader David Ford was elected Minister with the support of the DUP and Sinn Féin.

On 26 August 2015, the UUP announced it would withdraw from the Executive and form an opposition after all, in response to the assassination of Kevin McGuigan.

On 25 May 2016 a new executive was announced (three weeks after assembly election). For the first time in the assembly&#x27;s history, parties that were entitled to ministries (i.e. UUP, SDLP and Alliance) chose instead to go into opposition following a recent bill providing parties with this choice. This meant that the executive was formed only by the two major parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, and thus giving them more seats in the Executive (with the exception of the Department of Justice which was given to an Independent Unionist MLA, Claire Sugden, due to this appointment needing cross-community support).

==Procedure==

The Executive is co-chaired by the First Minister and deputy First Minister. Its official functions are:
*acting as a forum for the discussion of, and agreement on, issues which cut across the responsibilities of two or more ministers;
*prioritising executive and legislative proposals;
*discussing and agreeing upon significant or controversial matters; and
*recommending a common position where necessary (e.g. in dealing with external relationships).

Executive meetings are normally held fortnightly, compared to weekly meetings of the British Cabinet and Irish Government. Under the Executive&#x27;s Ministerial Code, ministers are obliged to:
*operate within the framework of the Programme for Government;
*support all decisions of the Executive and Northern Ireland Assembly; and
*participate fully in the Executive, the North/South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.
The Ministerial Code allows any three ministers to request a cross-community vote. The quorum for voting is seven ministers.
The current system of devolution has succeeded long periods of direct rule (1974–1999 and 2002–2007), when the Northern Ireland Civil Service had a considerable influence on government policy. The legislation which established new departments in 1999 affirmed that &quot;the functions of a department shall at all times be exercised subject to the direction and control of the Minister&quot;. Ministerial powers can be conferred by an Act of the Assembly and ministers can also exercise executive powers which are vested in the Crown.

Ministers are also subject to several limitations, including the European Convention on Human Rights, European Union law, other international obligations of the UK, a requirement not to discriminate on religious or political grounds, and having no power over reserved and excepted matters (which are held by the United Kingdom Government).

Ministerial decisions can be challenged by a petition of 30 Northern Ireland Assembly members. This action can be taken for alleged breaches of the Ministerial Code and on &quot;matters of public importance&quot;. The Speaker of the Assembly must consult political party leaders in the Assembly (who are often also ministers) before deciding whether the subject is a matter of public importance. Successful petitions will then be considered by the Executive.

The number of ministers and their responsibilities can be changed when a department is being established or dissolved. The proposal must be made by the First Minister and the deputy First Minister and be carried by a cross-community vote in the Assembly. The number of departments was initially limited to 10 but this increased to 11 upon the devolution of justice.

Ministers are disqualified from holding office if appointed to the Government of Ireland or as the chairman or deputy chairman of an Oireachtas (Irish Parliament) committee.

==Strategies==
The Good Friday Agreement states that the Executive will &quot;seek to agree each year, and review as necessary&quot; a Programme for Government incorporating an agreed budget.

The following programmes for government have been published to date:
*Draft Programme for Government (2001–2002) (25 October 2000)
*Draft Programme for Government (2002–2003) (24 September 2001)
*Programme for Government 2008–2011 (22 January 2008)
*Programme for Government 2011–2015 (12 March 2012)

The following budgets have been published to date:

*Budget 2008–11
*Budget 2011–15

Under the St Andrews Agreement, the Executive is obliged to adopt strategies on the following policy matters:
*enhancing and protecting the development of the Irish language;
*enhancing and developing Ulster Scots language, heritage and culture; and
*tackling poverty, social exclusion and patterns of deprivation based on objective need.

The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister published a child poverty strategy in March 2011. The wider anti-poverty strategy was carried over from direct rule in November 2006. As of November 2011, neither an Irish language strategy nor an Ulster Scots strategy had been adopted. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure states that a &quot;Strategy for Indigenous or Regional Minority Languages&quot; &quot;will be presented to the Executive in due course&quot;.

==History==
===1974===
The original Northern Ireland Executive was established on 1 January 1974, following the Sunningdale Agreement. It comprised a voluntary coalition between the Ulster Unionist Party, Social Democratic and Labour Party and Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, with the UUP&#x27;s Brian Faulkner in the position of Chief Executive. It was short-lived, collapsing on 28 May 1974 due to the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike, and the Troubles continued in the absence of a political settlement.

===Composition since devolution===

===1998–2002===

The current Executive was provided for in the Belfast Agreement, signed on 10 April 1998. Designates for First Minister and deputy First Minister were appointed on 1 July 1998 by the UUP and SDLP, respectively. A full Executive was nominated on 29 November 1999 and took office on 2 December 1999, comprising the UUP, SDLP, Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin.
Devolution was suspended for four periods, during which the departments came under the responsibility of direct rule ministers from the Northern Ireland Office:
* between 12 February 2000 and 30 May 2000;
* on 11 August 2001;
* on 22 September 2001;
* between 15 October 2002 and 8 May 2007.

The 2002–2007 suspension followed the refusal of the Ulster Unionist Party to share power with Sinn Féin after a high-profile Police Service of Northern Ireland investigation into an alleged Provisional Irish Republican Army spy ring.

===2007–2011===
The second Executive formed in 2007 was led by the DUP and Sinn Féin, with the UUP and SDLP also securing ministerial roles. 

However, the Executive did not meet between 19 June 2008 and 20 November 2008 due to a boycott by Sinn Féin. This took place during a dispute between the DUP and Sinn Féin over the devolution of policing and justice powers. Policing and justice powers were devolved on 12 April 2010, with the new Minister of Justice won by Alliance in a cross-community vote.

===2011–2016===
Following the Northern Ireland Assembly election held on 5 May 2011, a third Executive was formed on 16 May 2011 with the same five parties represented. Alliance for the first time gained administration of a department under the D&#x27;Hondt system, in addition to the Department of Justice.

Peter Robinson of the DUP and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin were nominated by their parties and appointed as First Minister and deputy First Minister on 12 May 2011. Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister opposed the joint appointment. On 16 May 2011, 10 other Executive ministers (with the exception of the Minister of Justice) and two junior ministers were appointed by their political parties. The Minister of Justice was then elected by the Assembly via a cross-community vote.

On 26 August 2015, the UUP withdrew from the Executive in protest over the alleged involvement of members of the Provisional IRA in the murder of Kevin McGuigan Sr. Danny Kennedy MLA&#x27;s position as Minister for Regional Development was later taken over by the DUP, thereby leaving four Northern Irish parties in the power sharing agreement. On 10 September 2015 Peter Robinson stepped down as First Minister, although he did not officially resign. Arlene Foster took over as acting First Minister. Robinson resumed his duties as First Minister again on 20 October 2015.

Following the signing of the Fresh Start Agreement, Peter Robinson announced his intention to stand down as leader of the DUP and First Minister of Northern Ireland. He subsequently resigned as DUP leader on 18 December 2015, being succeeded by Arlene Foster. Foster then took office as First Minister on 11 January 2016.

===2016–2017===
The fourth Executive was formed following the May 2016 election. The SDLP, UUP and Alliance Party left the Executive and formed the Official Opposition for the first time. Ministerial positions were proportionally allocated between the DUP and Sinn Féin, with independent unionist Claire Sugden serving as Minister of Justice. The government collapsed on 16 January 2017, after Martin McGuinness resigned in protest over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal. His resignation sparked a snap election as Sinn Féin refused to re-nominate a deputy First Minister.

In 2018, Arlene Foster stated that the ongoing political deadlock was caused by Sinn Féin&#x27;s insistence on an Irish Language Act that would grant legal status to the Irish language in Northern Ireland, which Foster&#x27;s party refuses to allow.

=== Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act 2019 ===

The Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Act 2019 was passed by the UK parliament on 10 July 2019 and became law on 24 July. The main purpose of the bill was to prevent another election and keep Northern Ireland services running in the absence of a functional devolved government. However, two Labour MPs, Conor McGinn and Stella Creasy, added amendments that would legalize same-sex marriage and liberalize abortion law (both devolved issues) if the DUP and Sinn Féin could not come to an agreement before 21 October.

===Reformation===

On 11 January 2020, the Executive was re-formed with Arlene Foster as First Minister and Sinn Féin&#x27;s Michelle O&#x27;Neill as deputy First Minister following the New Decade, New Approach agreement. All five parties joined the government; other ministers include Edwin Poots (DUP); Robin Swann (UUP), Nichola Mallon (SDLP), Gordon Lyons (DUP), and Declan Kearney (SF). Alliance Party leader Naomi Long was appointed justice minister. At the first session of the assembly, Foster stated that it was &quot;time for Stormont to move forward&quot;. The new speaker of the Assembly was a member of Sinn Féin. The collapse of this Executive led to the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election. 

On 3 February 2022, Paul Givan resigned as first minister, which automatically resigned Michelle O&#x27;Neill as deputy first minister and collapsed the executive of Northern Ireland.

On 30 January 2024, leader of the DUP Jeffrey Donaldson announced that the DUP would restore an executive government on the condition that new legislation was passed by the UK House of Commons.

==Executive committee==
On 8 May 2024, Conor Murphy stepped down as Minister for the Economy. First Minister Michelle O&#x27;Neill said that Deirdre Hargey will serve as an interim Minister for the Economy.

On 3 February 2025, Sinn Fein announced a reshuffle of their ministerial posts as a result of Conor Murphy&#x27;s election to the Seanad Éireann, with John O&#x27;Dowd becoming Minister of Finance, Caoimhe Archibald serving as Minister for the Economy and Liz Kimmins becoming the Minister for Infrastructure.

Ministers are assisted by backbench &quot;Assembly private secretaries&quot; (equivalent to parliamentary private secretaries). The non-political Attorney General for Northern Ireland is the chief legal advisor to the Executive, appointed by the First Minister and deputy First Minister, and may also attend Executive meetings.

<text>Emmanuel Bernard Le Roy Ladurie (, 19 July 1929 – 22 November 2023) was a French historian whose work was mainly focused upon Languedoc in the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, particularly the history of the peasantry. One of the leading historians of France, Le Roy Ladurie has been called the &quot;standard-bearer&quot; of the third generation of the &quot;Annales&quot; school and the &quot;rock star of the medievalists&quot;, noted for his work in social history.

==Early life and career==
Le Roy Ladurie was born in Les Moutiers-en-Cinglais, Calvados. His father was Jacques Le Roy Ladurie, who would become minister of Agriculture for Marshal Philippe Pétain and subsequently a member of the French Resistance after breaking with the Vichy regime. Le Roy Ladurie described his childhood in Normandy growing up on his family estate in the countryside as intensely Catholic and royalist in politics.
The Le Roy Ladurie family were originally the aristocratic de Roy Laduries, descended from a Catholic priest who fell in love with one of his parishioners, dropped out of the priesthood to marry her and was then ennobled by the Crown; the family dropped the aristocratic &quot;de&quot; from their surname at the time of the French Revolution. Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s grandfather was a French Army officer of Catholic royalist views who was dishonorably discharged from the Army in 1902 for refusing orders from the anti-clerical government to close Catholic schools. Later, the former Captain Le Roy Ladurie returned to rural Normandy, was elected mayor of Villeray and was active in organising a union for rural workers.

During his childhood, Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s hero was Marshal Pétain. Marshal Pétain&#x27;s fall from grace – from the hero of Verdun and one of France&#x27;s most loved men to the reviled collaborator and one of France&#x27;s most hated men, sentenced to death for high treason for his collaboration with Germany – had a major influence on Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s sense of history. Speaking of the rise and fall of Marshal Pétain from hero to traitor as an example of the vicissitudes of history, Le Roy Ladurie in a 1998 interview stated: &quot;I have remained fascinated since then with what we call decline and fall. France is full of people who became very important, then became nothing. My fascination is probably due to the fact that my own family was once important and then became zero. There was a contrast between my own career and the feelings in my family.&quot; Because his father had been a minister in the Vichy government, his son grew up in an atmosphere of family shame and disgrace. The historian was educated in Caen at the Collège Saint-Joseph, in Paris at the Lycée Henri-IV and in Sceaux at the Lycée Lakanal. He was awarded an &quot;agrégation&quot; in history after studying at the École Normale Supérieure (class of 1949) and a &quot;doctorat ès lettres&quot; from the University of Paris. Le Roy Ladurie taught at the Lycée de Montpellier, the University of Montpellier, the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris, the University of Paris and at the Collège de France, where he occupied from 1973 to 1999 the chair of History of Modern Civilization and became emeritus professor.

Le Roy Ladurie was a member of the French Communist Party (PCF) between 1945 and 1956. His devoutly Catholic parents had expected him to become a Catholic priest and were scandalized that their son should become an ardent Communist and atheist. The Great Depression of the 1930s together with France&#x27;s defeat in 1940 at the hands of Germany had caused many people in France to lose faith in both capitalism and liberal democracy. The leading role played by the French Communists in the Resistance during the German occupation and the willingness of many of the traditional French elites to support the Vichy regime together with the apparent success achieved by the Soviet regime&#x27;s planned economy and its &quot;scientific socialism&quot; led Le Roy Ladurie, like many other people of his generation in France, to embrace Communism as the best hope for humanity. The PCF proudly billed themselves as the &quot;party of 75,000 shot&quot;-a reference to the claim that the Germans had shot 75,000 French Communists between 1941 and 1944 (the true figure was actually 10,000); nevertheless the PCF had acquired tremendous prestige in 1940s France as a result of its role in the Resistance. The German occupation had been a profoundly traumatic experience for the French, not the least because unlike World War I, in which the &quot;Union sacrée&quot; proclaimed by Raymond Poincaré in 1914 had united the left and the right against the common German enemy, World War II had seen a civil war in France. The Resistance had fought not only the Germans, but also the police, gendarmes and the much feared &quot;Milice&quot; of the Vichy regime. The &quot;Milice&quot; were a collection of French fascists, gangsters and assorted adventurers used by the Vichy regime to hunt down and murder &quot;résistants&quot;, who in their turn assassinated members of the &quot;Milice&quot;. Given this background, in which many young French people had seen at first-hand the pretty streets, avenues and squares of French cities, towns and villages sullied by acts of outrageous cruelty and violence, Le Roy Ladurie described his generation as a scarred one, saying: &quot;It was dangerous for young people during the war. If we are subjected to violence, we will in turn be violent towards others. It is like someone who is sodomised and then sodomises others.&quot; Le Roy Ladurie explained that he became a Communist as a reaction to his war-time experiences.

When the Hungarian writer Arthur Koestler&#x27;s 1940 novel &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; was translated into French in 1949, Le Roy Ladurie saw it as confirming the greatness of Stalinism instead of the condemnation that Koestler had intended. Koestler&#x27;s novel concerned a prominent Soviet Communist and Old Bolshevik named Rubashov who was arrested and charged with crimes against the Soviet Union that he did not commit, but which he willingly confessed to in a show trial after hearing an appeal to Party discipline. The character of Rubashov is generally believed to be modeled by Koestler on Nikolai Bukharin, a prominent Old Bolshevik and the leader of the &quot;rightist&quot; (i.e. moderate) faction in the Communist Party who was shot in 1938 after a show trial in Moscow which Bukharin confessed to a fantastic array of bizarre and improbable charges such as being an agent of foreign powers, sabotage, &quot;wrecking&quot;, and working with Leon Trotsky from his exile in Mexico City and the &quot;White Guard&quot; leaders in Paris to overthrow Stalin. Bukharin&#x27;s real crime had been to oppose Stalin in the post-Lenin succession struggle in the 1920s and to advocate continuing the New Economic Policy - which allocated control of the &quot;commanding heights&quot; of the Soviet economy to the state while allowing free enterprise in the rest of the economy - as a viable model for the future. It was not until 1928 when Stalin brought in the First Five Year Plan that full socialism arrived in the Soviet Union, a policy choice that Bukharin had opposed. The image of the Bukharin-like character Rubashov confessing to crimes that he did not commit in order to uphold the greatness of Communism in &quot;Darkness At Noon&quot; caused a sensation at the time, but the truth was rather more brutal and sordid: Bukharin had been psychologically &quot;broken&quot; after months of torture by the NKVD, and had been reduced to such a state that he was willing to &quot;confess&quot; to anything. Le Roy Ladurie wrote in a 1949 essay about &quot;Darkness At Noon&quot; that: &quot;Rubashov was right to sacrifice his life and especially his revolutionary honor so that the best of all possible regimes could be established one day&quot;. Le Roy Ladurie was to subsequently admit that he had misunderstood the message of &quot;Darkness At Noon&quot;. At the height of the Cold War in the early 1950s, Le Roy Ladurie described the atmosphere inside the Party as &quot;une intensité liturgique&quot;.

In 1955, Le Roy Ladurie married Madeleine Pupponi with whom he had one son and one daughter. Le Roy Ladurie left the PCF after doubts caused by the 1956 Hungarian Revolution became too much for him. Le Roy Ladurie was later to write that the sight of Soviet tanks crushing the ordinary people of Hungary in 1956 who were merely demanding basic human rights led him to abandon his optimism of the late 1940s that the Soviet Union represented the best hope of humanity and instead led him to the conclusion that communism was an inhumane, totalitarian ideology that oppressed people in the Soviet Union, Hungary and elsewhere. Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s break with the PCF did not mean an immediate break with the left: he joined the Socialist Party, running as a Socialist candidate in Montpellier in 1957, winning 2.5% of the vote. In 1963, a disillusioned Le Roy Ladurie left the Socialists.

Le Roy Ladurie has often written for &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Express,&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot; newspapers, and appeared on French television (in France, historians have far more social prestige than they do in the English-speaking world; to be a successful historian in France is to be something of a celebrity).

Le Roy Ladurie was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1974) and the American Philosophical Society (1979). He was the first president of the Association Annie Kriegel, founded in 2000 in Saint-Valéry-sur-Somme to commemorate an anti-Communist historian who, like Ladurie, left the PCF following the events of 1956.

Le Roy Ladurie died on 22 November 2023, at the age of 94.

==&quot;Les paysans de Languedoc&quot;==
Le Roy Ladurie first attracted attention with his doctoral thesis, &quot;Les paysans de Languedoc&quot;, which was published as a book in 1966 and translated into English as &quot;The Peasants of Languedoc&quot; in 1974. In this study of the peasantry of Languedoc over several centuries, Le Roy Ladurie employed a huge range of quantitative information such as tithe records, wage books, tax receipts, rent receipts and profit records, together with the theories of thinkers such as Thomas Malthus to contend that the history of Languedoc was &quot;l&#x27;histoire immobile&quot; (history that stands still). He argued that the history of Languedoc was marked by waves of growth and decline that in essence changed very little over the passage of time. Influenced by the work of his mentor Fernand Braudel, Le Roy Ladurie set out to write a &quot;histoire totale&quot; (total history) of Languedoc from the 15th to the 18th centuries although as well as Braudel&#x27;s reliance on climate and geography, Ladurie argued that culture and economics also shaped the course of history.

Le Roy Ladurie proposed that the determining feature of life in Languedoc was the culture of the people who lived there, arguing that the people of Languedoc could not break the cycles of advance and decline not so much because of technological factors, but because of the culture that prevented them from developing more progressive technology and farming practices. In &quot;Les paysans de Languedoc&quot;, Le Roy Ladurie went against the prevailing Marxist view that dominated French historiography at the time that the history of early modern France from the 15th century to the 18th century was the ever-accelerating accumulation of property and wealthy by capitalists. Instead, Le Roy Ladurie contended that in Languedoc there had been cycles of economic advance and decline from the 15th to the 18th centuries. According to Le Roy Ladurie, there were four parts to the long economic cycle starting with &quot;the low water mark&quot; in the 15th century when French society was still recovering from the massive death toll caused by the Black Death which made way for a growing population, leading to a second phase the &quot;advance&quot; of growing prosperity that lasted until 1530, where the growing population hit a ceiling of agricultural productivity leading to a period of economic decline that lasted for the rest of the 16th century and a third phase if &quot;maturity&quot; in the 17th century when Languedoc&#x27;s agricultural productivity caught up and finally a fourth phase, &quot;the long period of recession&quot;. 

At the beginning of the 18th century, Languedoc society was, in Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s opinion, not far from where it had been two centuries earlier, thus making this entire period one of &quot;l&#x27;historie immobile&quot;. Le Roy Ladurie saw this as the result of the inability of the farmers of Languedoc to increase the productivity of the land, writing: &quot;Some have spoken of a &quot;natural&quot; ceiling on productive resources. But &#x27;nature&#x27; in this case is actually culture; it is the customs, the way of life, the mentality of the people; it is a whole formed by technical knowledge and a system of values, by the means employed and the ends pursued&quot;. Le Roy Ladurie argued that, as a result, the unwillingness of the peasants of Languedoc to engage in technologically innovative farming techniques to increase the productivity of the land (as was happening during the same period in England) was the result of the &quot;lack of the conscience, the culture, the morals, the politics, the education, the reformist spirit, and the unfettered longing for success&quot; that characterized the entire culture of Languedoc during these centuries. However, Le Roy Ladurie pointed out that what he had traced was not a cycle in the proper sense as Languedoc did not return in the 18th century to where it had been in the 15th. Even though this was overall a period of economic stagnation, Le Roy Ladurie noted that were &quot;islands&quot; of growth and change in Languedoc. Some of the more enterprising farmers started to grow silk and vines, the latter laying the foundations of the Languedoc wine industry. Others switched over to cloth manufacture. In conclusion, Le Roy Ladurie argued that these economic changes together with the beginning of elementary schools in which the sons of farmers acquired some literacy, the decline of religious fanaticism and a &quot;a general improvement in behavior&quot; all come together to bring about the &quot;economic takeoff&quot; of the 18th century, when the cycles of decline and advance were finally broken.

Le Roy Ladurie wrote that what he was exploring in &quot;Les paysans de Languedoc&quot; was the relationship between the &quot;vie culturelle&quot; that was the &quot;superstructure&quot; of beliefs, politics and thought as it was changed slowly by the &quot;vie matérielle&quot; of the environment and geography that was the &quot;base&quot; on which the superstructure rested.

==Montaillou==

Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s best-known work is &quot;Montaillou, village occitan de 1294 à 1324&quot; (1975), a study of the village of Montaillou in the region of Languedoc in the south of France during the age of the Cathar heresy. &quot;Montaillou&quot; was a bestseller in both France and after its translation into English in the United States and Great Britain, and remains Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s most popular book by far. As a result of the book, the previously little-known village of Montaillou became a popular tourist destination.

In &quot;Montaillou&quot;, Le Roy Ladurie used the records of the Inquisition of Jacques Fournier, Bishop of Pamiers, to develop a multi-layered study of life in a small French village over the course of several years. Le Roy Ladurie used the records of interrogations conducted by Fournier to offer a picture of both the material and mental worlds of the inhabitants of Montaillou. &quot;Montaillou&quot; was much praised by reviewers in both France and the English-speaking world for its vivid, atmospheric recreation of the everyday life of the people of Montaillou in the early 14th century. Many critics have noted that for Le Roy Ladurie, the village priest Father Pierre Clergue, an ardent womanizer whose vow of celibacy meant nothing and who apparently slept with most of the women of Montaillou seemed to be something of a hero for the historian. Clergue&#x27;s affair with the local aristocrat and noted beauty, the Countess Béatrice de Planisoles formed one of the central stories that Le Roy Ladurie related in &quot;Montaillou&quot; with much sympathy for the doomed couple.

Critics of Le Roy Ladurie have argued that the Holy Inquisition was an instrument of judicial repression for whom torture or the threat of torture were routine methods. The Canadian historian Norman Cantor argued that none of the people questioned by Fournier had appeared willingly before the Holy Inquisition, and that therefore the Fournier Register which Le Roy Ladurie had used as his main source for &quot;Montaillou&quot; is not reliable. Other critics have noted that the people questioned by Fournier spoke in Occitan, had their remarks written down in Latin and that Le Roy Ladurie had translated the text into French and have wondered if something has been lost in the translation.

==Resisting the &quot;totalitarian temptation&quot;==
In France, the &quot;intelligentsia&quot; has more prestige than does the &quot;intelligentsia&quot; in the English-speaking world and as such, intellectuals are expected to take stands on the major issues of the day. In January 1978, Le Roy Ladurie was a founding member of the &quot;Comité des intellectuals pour l&#x27;Europe des libertés&quot; (Committee of Intellectuals for a Europe of liberties), an anti-communist group of liberal French intellectuals opposed to the powerful influence of the French Communist Party on French intellectual life and the alliance of the Socialists and the Communists which they saw as a threat to French democracy. The &quot;Comité des intellectuals pour l&#x27;Europe des libertés&quot; was not a conservative group, and instead was opposed to Communism from a liberal vantage-point, declaring itself opposed to both &quot;the unarticulated cry and pure revolt on one hand and absolute knowledge and totalizing ideology on the other&quot;, damning the &quot;fatal socialist-statist equation&quot; as offering the end of the Republic and everything it stood for. In its founding manifesto, the &quot;Comité des intellectuals pour l&#x27;Europe des libertés&quot; declared its intention &quot;to defend the synonymy of these three words: Europe, culture, freedom&quot;. Significantly, the committee did not limit its remit to France or even Western Europe, instead proclaiming its intention to defend liberty in all of Europe, Western and Eastern. He analysed his political engagement and Communism in &quot;Ouverture, société, pouvoir: de l’Édit de Nantes à la chute du communisme&quot; (2004) and &quot;Les grands procès politiques, ou la pédagogie infernale&quot; (2002).

==&quot;Carnaval de Romans&quot;==
Another work was &quot;Le Carnaval de Romans: de la chandeleur au mercredi des cendres&quot; (translated into English as &quot;Carnival in Romans&quot;) which dealt with the 1580 massacre of about twenty artisans at the annual carnival in the town of Romans-sur-Isère, France. In this book, Le Roy Ladurie used the only two surviving eyewitness accounts of the massacre (one of which was hostile towards to the victims of the massacre by Guérin, the other sympathetic yet often inaccurate by Piémond), together with such information as plague lists and tax lists, to treat the massacre as a microcosm of the political, social and religious conflicts of rural society in the latter half of the 16th century in France. This book provides an example of a micro-historical approach to the social structure of the town of Romans and tax rebellions in early modern France.

==Social history==
Other more recent treatments of social history by Le Roy Ladurie have included &quot;La sorcière de Jasmin&quot; (translated into English as &quot;Jasmin&#x27;s Witch&quot;) and &quot;Le siècle des Platter, 1499-1628&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The Beggar and the Professor: A Sixteenth Century Family Drama&quot;). In &quot;Jasmin&#x27;s Witch&quot;, Le Roy Ladurie following the lead of Carlo Ginzburg, who argued that the idea of witchcraft as held by peasants was very different from the idea of witchcraft held by judges and churchmen. To understand the &quot;total social fact of witchcraft&quot;, Le Roy Ladurie used the 1842 poem &quot;Françouneto&quot; written by Jacques Boè and based on a traditional French peasant folk tale. Le Roy Ladurie contended that the poem contains many authentic traces of popular beliefs about witchcraft in rural France during the 17th and 18th centuries. Le Roy Ladurie argued that the &quot;crime&quot; of the &quot;witch&quot; Françouneto was the violation of the unwritten social code of &quot;limited wealth&quot;, namely that she increased her own wealth at the expense of others. In &quot;The Beggar and the Professor&quot;, Le Roy Ladurie used the letters and memoirs of the Platter family to examine the social values of the 16th century, especially in regards to religion, medicine, crime, learning, and taxes. Another work of social history by Le Roy Ladurie was his 1982 book &quot;Love, Death, and Money in the Pays d&#x27;Oc, The French Peasantry: 1450-1660&quot;, which as it title indicates examined the views held by French peasants about love, death and money.

==Political history==
Though best known for his work in &quot;microhistory&quot;, Le Roy Ladurie has also examined the political history of France between 1460 and 1774 in a two-volume history. The first volume was &quot;L&#x27;Etat royal: de Louis XI à Henri IV, 1460-1610&quot; (translated into English as&quot; The French Royal State: 1460-1610&quot;). In this book, Le Roy Ladurie argued that the major concerns of the French Crown were the economy, the Reformation and aristocratic politics, and that the main reasons for the growth of the French state was the need to raise revenue to pay for military expansion into Italy, Provence and Burgundy and its rivalry with Spain over mastery of western Europe.

In the second volume, &quot;Ancien Régime: de Louis XIII à Louis XV, 1610-1774&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The Ancien Régime&quot;), Le Roy Ladurie argued that there was a close connection between the domestic and foreign policies of the French Crown. In particular, Le Roy Ladurie argued that periods of authoritarianism in domestic policy coincided with periods of aggression in foreign policy, and that periods of liberalism in domestic policy coincided with periods of a pacific foreign policy. In order to pay for war, the French state had to increase taxation to raise the necessary funds. In &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; France, society was divided into three legal categories; the First Estate (the Catholic Church), the Second Estate (the nobility) and the Third Estate (the commoners). The first two estates, which comprised the wealthier elements of French society, were exempt from taxation and to make up the shortfall in revenue, the Third Estate was taxed more heavily than what would have been the case if the tax burden in French society had been spread with greater equality. Le Roy Ladurie argued that because war was so expensive, the French state always had to drastically increase taxation in times of conflict. And that because of the highly unequal nature of the French tax system, the increased taxes had to be accompanied with increased repression to crush the social resistance generated by the higher taxes. The three men who dominated French politics in the 17th century, namely the Cardinal Richelieu, Cardinal Mazarin and King Louis XIV were all obsessed with winning &quot;la gloire&quot; (the glory) of making France into the world&#x27;s greatest power, which meant that the 17th century was a period of constant warfare where France was almost always at war with some other power to win &quot;la gloire&quot;. As a result, anti-tax revolts frequently broke out all over France in the 17th century as the Third Estate attempted to reject the oppressively heavy taxation needed to pay for the wars intended to win &quot;la gloire&quot;. All of the anti-tax revolts were crushed with ferocious brutality by the Crown to send the message that it was folly on the part of ordinary people to challenge the might of the French state. Despite certain lapses in the 1750s, Le Roy Ladurie argued that the reign of King Louis XV was characterized by liberalism at home and peace abroad while the rule of Cardinal Richelieu and King Louis XIV was marked by aggression and authoritarianism. At the end of his two-volume history, Le Roy Ladurie stated that the growth of popularity of Enlightenment ideas, anti-clericalism, and liberalism had by 1774 already placed France on the road to the French Revolution. The American historian Stuart Carroll commented that in these books of the 1990s, Le Roy Ladurie was according the decisions individuals and &quot;histoire événementielle&quot; a level of importance in influencing history that he had rejected in his 1973 book &quot;Le Territoire de l&#x27;historien&quot; where he had claimed the quantitative methodology and the study of long-term structural changes had replaced &quot;histoire événementielle&quot; and biographies as the main focus of the work of a historian.

==Historiography==

Ladurie&#x27;s mentor was Fernand Braudel, a prominent member of the Annales School and one of the most prolific contemporary historians.

At the beginning of the 1970s, Ladurie founded the movement of the &quot;Nouvelle histoire&quot; (New History). Le Roy Ladurie is a leading champion of &quot;microhistory&quot;, in which a historian uses the study of an event, locality, family or life to reveal the &quot;structures&quot; which underlie life in the particular period under study. Some, like Niall Ferguson, have questioned the value of &quot;microhistory&quot;, arguing that it is wrong to assume that the study of one village or one incident in one town or one family reveals wider patterns of life in France, let alone the rest of Europe. Another line of criticism has centered around Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s use of the term &quot;structures&quot;. His critics contend that he has never clearly defined the term, nor explained why &quot;structures&quot; change over time, or even whether the &quot;structures&quot; Le Roy Ladurie purports to find exist.

Le Roy Ladurie has also worked on the history of French regions (&quot;Histoire de France des régions&quot;, 2004) and on anthropometric history as well as on the impact of climate changes on human history. Besides writing books, Le Roy Ladurie is a prolific essayist writing on variety of subjects such as the utility of computers as method of historical research, rates of delinquency in the French Army in the 19th century, the spread of global diseases and the belief of French peasants that magic could be used to generate impotence. The latter was a reference to the widespread practice of French peasant men in the Middle Ages and the early modern period of paying witches to use their (supposed) magical powers to make their rivals in love go impotent. Le Roy Ladurie is also known as one of the first modern environmental historians because his work focused on human agency in environmental change, as well as environmental factors in human history.

<text>Sir Josiah Mason (23 February 1795 – 16 June 1881) was an English industrialist, engaged in pen manufacture and other trades, and a philanthropist. He founded Mason Science College in 1875, which later became the University of Birmingham.

==Biography==
He was the son of a carpet-weaver, and was born in Mill Street, Kidderminster. He began life as a street hawker of cakes, fruits and vegetables. After trying his hand in his native town at shoemaking, baking, carpentering, blacksmithing, house-painting and carpet-weaving, he moved in 1816 to Birmingham. Here he found employment in the gilt-toy trade. In 1824 he set up on his own account as a manufacturer of split-rings by machinery, to which he subsequently added the making of steel pens. Owing to the circumstance of his pens being marketed through James Perry (founder of Perry &amp; Co., the London stationer whose name they bore) he was less well known than Joseph Gillott and other makers, although he was really the largest producer in England, contributing heavily to the Birmingham pen trade.
In 1874 the business was converted into a limited liability company. Besides his steel-pen trade, Mason carried on for many years the business of electro-plating, copper-smelting, and India-rubber ring making, in conjunction with George Elkington.

Mason was almost entirely self-educated, having taught himself to write when a shoemaker&#x27;s apprentice, and in later life he felt his deficiencies keenly. It was this which led him in 1860 to establish his great orphanage at Erdington, near Sutton Coldfield, some 6 miles from Birmingham. Upon it he expended about £300,000, and for this munificent endowment he was knighted in 1872. He had previously given a dispensary to his native town and an almshouse to Erdington. In 1880 Mason College, since incorporated in the University of Birmingham, was opened. The total value of the endowment was about £250,000.

In commemoration of him, his bust stands at the centre of the roundabout at the junction of Chester Road &amp; Orphanage Road in Erdington (). This bronze bust was cast in 1951 by William Bloye from a marble statue by Francis John Williamson in 1885, which stood opposite Mason Science College in Edmund Street, but which has since been destroyed. Williamson&#x27;s statue was erected posthumously, Mason having vetoed its creation during his lifetime. The bust is often &quot;dressed&quot; on special occasions and seasonal holidays.

<text>National Armed Forces (NSZ; &quot;Polish:&quot; Narodowe Siły Zbrojne) was a Polish right-wing underground military organization of the National Democracy operating from 1942. During World War II, NSZ troops fought against Nazi Germany and communist partisans. There were also cases of fights with the Home Army.

At the end of the war, some units and structures of this organization cooperated with the Nazis and Gestapo (as in the case of the Holy Cross Mountains Brigade and Hubert Jura) and committed crimes motivated by antisemitism.

Most NSZ units did not submit to the Polish government-in-exile and conducted fratricidal fights with other Polish partisan units. From 1944 to 1946, the NSZ fought as part of the anti-communist resistance, including after the postwar Polish People&#x27;s Republic was established.

== History ==
The NSZ was created on September 20, 1942, as a result of the merger of the Military Organization Lizard Union (&quot;Organizacja Wojskowa Związek Jaszczurczy&quot;) and part of the National Military Organization (&quot;Narodowa Organizacja Wojskowa&quot;). At its maximum strength in 1943–44, the NSZ reached between 70,000 and 75,000 members, making it the third-largest organization of the Polish resistance (after the Home Army (AK) and the Bataliony Chlopskie). NSZ units participated in the Warsaw Uprising.

In March 1944 the NSZ split, with the more moderate faction coming under the command of the AK. The other part became known as the NSZ-ZJ (the Lizard Union). This branch of the NSZ conducted operations against Polish communist activists, partisans and secret police, the Soviet partisans, NKVD and SMERSH, and their own (NSZ) former leaders.

== Political stance ==

The NSZ&#x27;s program included the fight for Polish independence against Nazi Germany as well as against the Soviet Union. Its goal was to keep the Second Polish Republic&#x27;s prewar eastern territories and borders, while regaining additional former German territories to the west, which they deemed &quot;ancient Slavic lands&quot;. The General Directive Nr. 3 of the National Armed Forces General Command, L. 18/44 from January 15, 1944, reads: 
&quot;In the face of crossing of Polish borders by Soviet forces, the Polish Government in London and its Polish citizens living on the territory of Poland express their unwavering desire for the return of the sovereignty to the entire area of Poland within the Polish borders established prior to 1939 through the mutually-binding Treaty of Riga and reaffirmed by the general principles of the Atlantic Charter, as well as by the declarations of the Allied governments which did not concede to any territorial changes that took place in Poland after August 1939.&quot;

During the war, the NSZ fought the Polish communists, including their military organizations such as the Gwardia Ludowa (GL) and the Armia Ludowa (AL). After the war, former NSZ members were persecuted by the newly installed communist government of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. Reportedly, communist partisans engaged in planting false evidence, such as documents and forged receipts at the sites of their own robberies, in order to blame the NSZ. It was a method of political warfare practiced against the NSZ also by the Ministry of Public Security of Poland and Milicja Obywatelska (MO) right after the war, as revealed by communist Poland&#x27;s court documents.

== National Armed Forces and Jews ==
The National Armed Forces (though not uniformly) did not accept Jews in their ranks, and expressed explicit anti-semitic sentiment.

From November 1944 to mid-1947, during the period of armed anti-communist insurgency against the Soviet takeover of Poland, many Jews who were part of communist groups were killed by the National Armed Forces. In Warsaw, the National Armed Forces killed Jerzy Makowiecki and Ludwik Widerszal, two Polish Home Army officers of Jewish origin. Polish historian Alina Cała said that the doctrine of the National Armed Forces was primarily the elimination of what they considered to be Communist bands. According to sociologist Tadeusz Piotrowski, these attacks later &quot;became more focused on individual Jews who were placed in highly visible positions of authority in the PRL [People&#x27;s Republic of Poland]&quot;.

In some districts, the National Armed Forces actively pursued Jews. Some units of the National Armed Forces were on the lookout for Jews hiding in the forests to deliver to the Germans. In Radom, the National Armed Forces cooperated with the Germans towards that goal in 1943–1944. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Holocaust&quot;, Polish Jews who had sought shelter among ethnic Poles after escaping from ghettos were directly murdered by the National Armed Forces.

According to other sources, many National Armed Forces soldiers and their families are credited with having saved Jews, including such noted ones as Maria Bernstein, Leon Goldman, Jonte Goldman, and Dr. Turski. The National Armed Forces did have Jews in its ranks, including Calel Perechodnik, Wiktor Natanson, Captain Roman Born-Bornstein (chief physician of the Chrobry II unit), Jerzy Zmidygier-Konopka, Feliks Pisarewski-Parry, Eljahu (Aleksander) Szandcer (&quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Dzik&quot;), Dr. Kaminski, a physician who served in an NSZ unit led by Captain Władysław Kolaciński (&quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Zbik&quot;), Major Stanisław Ostwind-Zuzga, and others.

In January 1945, the National Armed Forces Holy Cross Mountains Brigade (&quot;Brygada Świętokrzyska&quot;) retreated before the advancing Red Army and, after negotiating a ceasefire with the Germans, moved into the Nazi-controlled Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. It resumed operations against the Nazis on 5 May 1945 in Bohemia, where the brigade liberated prisoners from a concentration camp in Holýšov, including 280 Jewish women prisoners slated for death.

== Postwar ==
Members of the NSZ, like other &quot;cursed soldiers&quot;, and their families were persecuted during the postwar Stalinist period. In the fall of 1946, 100-200 soldiers of an NSZ unit under the command of Henryk Flame, &quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Bartek,&quot; were lured into a trap and massacred by communist military and police forces. On December 10, 1946, the District Military Court in Warsaw issued a verdict in the trial of the NSZ command. It was one of many trials organized in the pre-election period to intimidate society. Among those sentenced to death were NSZ officers Col. Piotr Abakanowicz and Michał Pobocha, as well as Stefania Broniewska, the wife of the NSZ commander-in-chief Zygmunt Broniewski, who was in exile. On March 2, 1948, the verdict was announced in the trial of the NSZ Headquarters, accused by the communists of fascism. The District Military Court in Warsaw sentenced to death Col. Stanisław Ksznica and Lech Neyman.

Some of the NSZ were responsible for the 1946 pacification of villages in northeast Poland, in which ethnic Belarusian Polish citizens were attacked; 79 were killed. The National Armed Forces were officially dissolved in 1947.

In 1992, acknowledging its contribution to the fight for Poland&#x27;s sovereignty, Polish authorities recognized National Armed Forces underground soldiers as war veterans. NSZ soldiers were rehabilitated, including some controversial ones, for instance, Mieczysław Pazderski, who in 1945 murdered almost 200 Ukrainian villagers in Wierzchowina, and who was awarded two medals by Polish president Lech Wałęsa. The Polish Parliament Sejm passed a bill in 2012 commemorating the 70th anniversary of the creation of &quot;Narodowe Siły Zbrojne&quot; in 1942. Members of the Sejm who supported the resolution pointed out that NSZ members became the most obstinate target of repressions and hate propaganda by security apparatus under Stalinism.

In the 1990s the topic of &quot;cursed soldiers&quot;, or anti-communist partisans, was not discussed much in Poland. By the 2000s however, the cult of &quot;cursed soldiers&quot; gained prominence. In 2012, the Polish Parliament (Sejm) passed a bill commemorating the 70th anniversary of the creation of &quot;Narodowe Siły Zbrojne&quot; in 1942.

The role of NSZ and its relations with the Jews remains a controversial topic in modern Poland. The 2012 Sejm declaration has been criticized by former Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller. Several members of parliament criticized the bill and walked out of a related commemorative ceremony.

<text>Grog is a term used for a variety of alcoholic beverages.

==Origin and history==
===Popularization of rum and invention of grog===
Following England&#x27;s conquest of Jamaica in 1655, rum gradually replaced beer and brandy as the drink of choice. The prior ration of eight pints of beer was replaced with a ration of one half-pint of spirits. In 1740, to minimise the subsequent illness, drunkenness, and disciplinary problems, British Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon ordered that the daily rum issue of of rum be mixed with of water, a water-to-rum ratio of 4:1, with half issued before noon and the remainder after the end of the working day. This both diluted its effects and accelerated its spoilage, preventing hoarding of the allowance. The mixture of rum and water became known as a &quot;grog&quot;. This procedure became part of the official regulations of the Royal Navy in 1756 until the reduction of the ration to the &quot;tot&quot; in 1850. Sailors were given of rum daily, or 17.5 imperial oz a week. The issued ration of rum was called a &quot;tot,&quot; and typically had a high alcohol content (54.6% ABV). continued until 1970.

Some writers have said that Vernon also added citrus juice to prevent spoilage and that it was found to prevent scurvy. This is not the case, and is based on a misreading of Vernon&#x27;s order. Having instructed his captains to dilute the sailors&#x27; daily allowance of rum with water, he says that those members of the crew &quot;which ... are good husbandmen may from the saving of their salt provisions and bread, purchase sugar and limes to make it more palatable to them.&quot; Lime juice was not then known to combat scurvy; scurvy symptoms at the time were largely treated with a diet of &quot;fresh food&quot;, sauerkraut, meat broth, malt, and citrus oil.
===Etymology===
The word originally referred to rum diluted with water, which Edward Vernon introduced into the British naval squadron he commanded in the West Indies on 21 August 1740. Vernon wore a coat of grogram cloth and was nicknamed &quot;Old Grogram&quot; or &quot;Old Grog&quot;. The &quot;Merriam–Webster Collegiate Dictionary&quot;, which agrees with this story of the word&#x27;s origin, states that the word &quot;grog&quot; was first used in this sense in 1770, though other sources cite 1749.

In the 19th century, coopers who crafted barrels on ships were often called groggers (or jolly jack tars), since when a barrel of rum had been emptied they would fill it up with boiling water and roll it around, creating a drink, which was called grog.

===Serving practices===
====British ships====
Until the daily tot was discontinued in 1970, Royal Navy rum was 95.5 proof (54.6% ABV); the usual ration was , diluted 4:1 with water. Extra rum rations were provided for special celebrations, such as Trafalgar Day, and sailors might share their ration with the cook or with a messmate celebrating a birthday. Until the early 20th century, weaker &quot;six water grog&quot; (rum diluted with water at a 6:1 ratio) was sometimes issued as a punishment to sailors found guilty of drunkenness or neglect.

Over time the distribution of the rum ration acquired a fixed form. At 11:00am, the boatswain&#x27;s mate piped &quot;Up spirits&quot;, the signal for the petty officer of the day to climb to the quarterdeck and collect the keys to the spirit room from an officer, the ship&#x27;s cooper, and a detachment of Royal Marines. In procession, they unlocked the door of the spirit room, and witnessed the pumping into a keg of one-eighth pint of rum for every rating and petty officer on the ship aged 20 or more and not under punishment. Two marines lifted the keg to the deck, standing guard while a file of cooks from the petty officers&#x27; messes held out their jugs. The sergeant of marines poured the ration under direction of the chief steward, who announced the number of drinking men present in each petty officer&#x27;s mess. The rest of the rum was mixed in a tub with two parts water, becoming the grog provided to the ratings.

At noon, the boatswain&#x27;s mate piped &quot;Muster for Rum&quot;, and the cooks from each mess presented with tin buckets. The sergeant of marines ladled out the authorised number of tots (eighth-pints) supervised by the petty officer of the day. The few tots of grog remaining in the tub (&quot;plushers&quot;), if any, were poured into the drains (scuppers), visibly running into the sea.

The petty officers were served first, and entitled to take their rum undiluted. The ratings often drank their grog in one long gulp when they finished their work around noon.

====American ships====
The practice of serving grog twice a day carried over into the Continental Navy and the U.S. Navy. Robert Smith, then Secretary of the Navy, experimented with substituting native rye whiskey for the rum. Finding the American sailors preferred it, he made the change permanent. It is said his sailors followed the practice of their British antecedents and took to calling it &quot;Bob Smith&quot; instead of grog. 

Unlike their Navy counterparts, American merchant seamen were not encouraged to partake of grog. In his 1848 testimony before a parliamentary committee, Robert Minturn of Grinnell, Minturn &amp; Co &quot;stated that teetotalism not only was encouraged by American ship-owners, but actually earned a bonus from underwriters, who offered a return of ten percent of the insurance premium upon voyages performed without the consumption of spirits ... The sailors were allowed plenty of hot coffee, night or day, in heavy weather, but grog was unknown on board American merchant ships.&quot;

===End of naval rum rationing===
The American Navy ended the daily spirit ration on 1 September 1862. The temperance movements of the late 19th century began to change the attitude toward drink in Britain, and the days of grog slowly came to an end. In 1850 the size of the tot was halved to per day. The issue of grog to officers ended in 1881, and to warrant officers in 1918. On 28 January 1970, the &quot;Great Rum Debate&quot; took place in the House of Commons, and on 31 July 1970, later called &quot;Black Tot Day&quot;, the practice finally ended, although all ratings received an allowance of an extra can of beer each day as compensation.

In the early stages of British settlement in Australia, the word &quot;grog&quot; entered common usage, to describe diluted, adulterated, and sub-standard rum, obtainable from sly-grog shops. In the early decades of the Australian colonies such beverages were often the only alcohol available to the working class. Eventually in Australia and New Zealand the word grog came to be used as a slang collective term for alcohol, such as going to the &quot;sly-grog shop&quot; to buy grog.

Honoring the 18th century British Army regimental mess and grog&#x27;s historical significance in the military, the United States Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Army carry on a tradition at its formal dining in ceremonies whereby those in attendance who are observed to violate formal etiquette are &quot;punished&quot; by being sent to &quot;the grog&quot; and publicly drink from it in front of the attendees. The grog usually consists of various alcoholic beverages mixed together, unappealing to the taste, and contained in a toilet bowl. A non-alcoholic variety of the grog is also typically available for those in attendance who do not consume alcohol, and can contain anything from hot sauce to mayonnaise intended to make it unappealing as well.

Similar practice continued in the Royal Navy until &quot;Black Tot Day&quot;, on 31 July 1970, when concerns over crew members operating machinery under the influence led to the rum ration being abolished.

===Various recipes===
While many claim to make a traditional navy grog recipe, there are several accepted forms. The Royal Navy&#x27;s grog recipe includes water, dark rum, lemon juice, and cinnamon. A commonly found recipe in the Caribbean includes water, light rum, grapefruit juice, orange juice, pineapple juice, cinnamon, and honey.

==Modern usage==
Modern versions of the drink are often made with hot or boiling water, and sometimes include lemon juice, lime juice, cinnamon, or sugar to add flavor. Additionally in the United States, apple cider is sometimes substituted for water. Rum with water, sugar, and nutmeg was known as bumbo and was more popular with pirates and merchantmen. In Cape Verde, &quot;grogue&quot; is a distilled spirit made of sugarcane, similar to rum. In Australia and New Zealand, the word has come to mean any alcoholic drink; in Australian Aboriginal English in particular, the term &quot;grog&quot; is extremely commonly used, to the point of appearing outside of casual use, such as in surveys and official documents.

In Northern Germany, &quot;grog&quot; is a &quot;classic winter drink from East Frisia&quot; made of rum, sugar and water and heated to boiling point. In Sweden and some subcultures within the English-speaking world, &quot;grogg&quot; is a common description of drinks not made to a recipe, but by mixing various kinds of alcoholic and soft drinks, fruit juice or similar ingredients. In Sweden, the mixture is usually between 5:1 and 1:1 of soft drink/cordial and spirit. The difference between Swedish grog and long drinks, mixed drinks, or punches is the number of ingredients. The number of ingredients in drinks may vary, but grog typically has just one kind of liquor (most commonly vodka or brännvin, but others like rum, whisky, cognac, or eau de vie are also used), and one kind of a non-alcoholic beverage. While there are no standard recipes, some varieties are commonly known:
* &quot;Grosshandlargrogg&quot; (&quot;wholesaler grog&quot;) refers to a mix of eau de vie and Sockerdricka.
* &quot;Musöppnare&quot; is mixed by adding orange juice to brännvin until the taste of alcohol disappears.
* &quot;Vargtass&quot; (&quot;Wolf&#x27;s paw&quot;) is a mix of brännvin and lingon cordial.

In other parts of Europe, notably the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, &quot;grog&quot; is used for a hot drink, usually made of black tea, lemon juice, honey and a splash of rum. It is a popular winter drink, said to be a remedy for the common cold in Belgium and France or for flu in the Netherlands.

In Canada, W. T. Lynch Foods Ltd sells a powdered hot beverage mix marketed in English as &quot;Hot Apple Olde Style Cider Mix&quot; and in Canadian French as &quot;Grog aux pommes mélange à l&#x27;ancienne&quot;. It is non-alcoholic and marketed as an alternative to other non-alcoholic hot drinks.

Grog has also been used as a metaphoric term for a person&#x27;s vices, as in the old Irish song &quot;All For Me Grog&quot;. The beverage has also lent its name to the word &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Warsaw Uprising (; ), sometimes referred to as the August Uprising (), was a major World War II operation by the Polish underground resistance to liberate Warsaw from German occupation. It occurred in the summer of 1944, and it was led by the Polish resistance Home Army (). The uprising was timed to coincide with the retreat of the German forces from Poland ahead of the Soviet advance. While approaching the eastern suburbs of the city, the Red Army halted combat operations, enabling the Germans to regroup and defeat the Polish resistance and to destroy the city in retaliation. The Uprising was fought for 63 days with little outside support. It was the single largest military effort taken by any European resistance movement during World War II. The defeat of the uprising and suppression of the Home Army enabled the pro-Soviet Polish administration, instead of the Polish government-in-exile based in London, to take control of Poland afterwards. Poland would remain as part of the Soviet-aligned Eastern Bloc throughout the Cold War until 1989.

The Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide Operation Tempest, launched at the time of the Soviet Lublin–Brest Offensive. The main Polish objectives were to drive the Germans out of Warsaw while helping the Allies defeat Germany. An additional, political goal of the Polish Underground State was to liberate Poland&#x27;s capital and assert Polish sovereignty before the Soviet Union and Soviet-backed Polish Committee of National Liberation, which already controlled eastern Poland, could assume control. Other immediate causes included a threat of mass German round-ups of able-bodied Poles for &quot;evacuation&quot;; calls by Radio Moscow&#x27;s Polish Service for uprising; and an emotional Polish desire for justice and revenge against the enemy after five years of German occupation.

Despite the early gains by the Home Army, the Germans successfully counterattacked on August 25th, in an attack that killed as many as 40,000 civilians. The uprising was now in a siege phase which favored the better-equipped Germans and eventually the Home Army surrendered on October 2 when their supplies ran out. The Germans then deported the remaining civilians in the city and razed the city itself. In the end, as many as 15,000 insurgents and 250,000 civilians lost their lives, while the Germans lost around 16,000 men.

Scholarship since the fall of the Soviet Union, combined with eyewitness accounts, has questioned Soviet motives and suggested their lack of support for the Warsaw Uprising represented their ambitions in Eastern Europe. The Red Army did not reinforce resistance fighters or provide air support. Declassified documents indicate that Joseph Stalin had tactically halted his forces from advancing on Warsaw in order to exhaust the Polish Home Army and to aid his political desires of turning Poland into a Soviet-aligned state. Scholars note the two month period of the Warsaw Uprising marked the start of the Cold War.

Casualties during the Warsaw Uprising were catastrophic. Although the exact number of casualties is unknown, it is estimated that about 16,000 members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6,000 badly wounded. In addition, between 150,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians died, mostly from mass executions. Jews being harboured by Poles were exposed by German house-to-house clearances and mass evictions of entire neighbourhoods. The defeat of the Warsaw Uprising also further decimated urban areas of Poland.
==Background==

In 1944, Poland had been occupied by Nazi Germany for almost five years. The Polish Home Army planned some form of rebellion against German forces. Germany was fighting a coalition of Allied powers, led by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States. The initial plan of the Home Army was to link up with the invading forces of the Western Allies as they liberated Europe from the Nazis. However, when the Soviet Army began its offensive in 1943, it became clear that Poland would be liberated by it instead of the Western Allies.

The Soviets and the Poles had a common enemyGermanybut were working towards different post-war goals: the Home Army desired a pro-Western, capitalist Poland, but the Soviet leader Stalin intended to establish a pro-Soviet, socialist Poland. It became obvious that the advancing Soviet Red Army might not come to Poland as an ally but rather only as &quot;the ally of an ally&quot;.

The Soviets and the Poles distrusted each other and Soviet partisans in Poland often clashed with a Polish resistance increasingly united under the Home Army&#x27;s front. Stalin broke off Polish–Soviet relations on 25 April 1943 after the Germans revealed the Katyn massacre of Polish army officers, and Stalin refused to admit to ordering the killings and denounced the claims as German propaganda. Afterwards, Stalin created the Rudenko Commission, whose goal was to blame the Germans for the war crime at all costs. The Western alliance accepted Stalin&#x27;s words as truth in order to keep the Anti-Nazi alliance intact. On 26 October, the Polish government-in-exile issued instructions to the effect that, if diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union were not resumed before the Soviet entry into Poland, Home Army forces were to remain underground pending further decisions.

However, the Home Army commander, Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski, took a different approach, and on 20 November, he outlined his own plan, which became known as Operation Tempest. On the approach of the Eastern Front, local units of the Home Army were to harass the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in the rear and co-operate with incoming Soviet units as much as possible. Although doubts existed about the military necessity of a major uprising, planning continued. General Bór-Komorowski and his civilian advisor were authorised by the government in exile to proclaim a general uprising whenever they saw fit.

==Eve of the battle==
The situation came to a head on 13 July 1944 as the Soviet offensive crossed the old Polish border. At this point the Poles had to make a decision: either initiate the uprising in the current difficult political situation and risk a lack of Soviet support, or fail to rebel and face Soviet propaganda describing the Home Army as impotent or worse, Nazi collaborators. They feared that if Poland was liberated by the Red Army, then the Allies would ignore the London-based Polish government in the aftermath of the war. The urgency for a final decision on strategy increased as it became clear that, after successful Polish-Soviet co-operation in the liberation of Polish territory (for example, in Operation Ostra Brama), Soviet security forces behind the frontline shot or arrested Polish officers and forcibly conscripted lower ranks into the Soviet-controlled forces. On 21 July, the High Command of the Home Army decided that the time to launch Operation Tempest in Warsaw was imminent. The plan was intended both as a political manifestation of Polish sovereignty and as a direct operation against the German occupiers. On 25 July, the Polish government-in-exile (without the knowledge and against the wishes of Polish Commander-in-Chief General Kazimierz Sosnkowski) approved the plan for an uprising in Warsaw with the timing to be decided locally.

In the early summer of 1944, German plans required Warsaw to serve as the defensive centre of the area and to be held at all costs. The Germans had fortifications constructed and built up their forces in the area. This process slowed after the failed 20 July plot to assassinate the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, and around that time, the Germans in Warsaw were weak and visibly demoralized. However, by the end of July, German forces in the area were reinforced. On 27 July, the Governor of the Warsaw District, Ludwig Fischer, called for 100,000 Polish men and women to report for work as part of a plan which envisaged the Poles constructing fortifications around the city. The inhabitants of Warsaw ignored his demand, and the Home Army command became worried about possible reprisals or mass round-ups, which would disable their ability to mobilize. The Soviet forces were approaching Warsaw, and Soviet-controlled radio stations called for the Polish people to rise in arms.

On 25 July, the Union of Polish Patriots, in a broadcast from Moscow, stated: The Polish Army of Polish Patriots ... calls on the thousands of brothers thirsting to fight, to smash the foe before he can recover from his defeat ... Every Polish homestead must become a stronghold in the struggle against the invaders ... Not a moment is to be lost. On 29 July, the first Soviet armoured units reached the outskirts of Warsaw, where they were counter-attacked by two German Panzer Corps: the 39th and 4th SS. On 29 July 1944 Radio Station Kosciuszko located in Moscow emitted a few times its &quot;Appeal to Warsaw&quot; and called to &quot;Fight The Germans!&quot;: No doubt Warsaw already hears the guns of the battle which is soon to bring her liberation. ... The Polish Army now entering Polish territory, trained in the Soviet Union, is now joined to the People&#x27;s Army to form the Corps of the Polish Armed Forces, the armed arm of our nation in its struggle for independence. Its ranks will be joined tomorrow by the sons of Warsaw. They will all together, with the Allied Army pursue the enemy westwards, wipe out the Hitlerite vermin from Polish land and strike a mortal blow at the beast of Prussian Imperialism. Bór-Komorowski and several officers held a meeting on that day. Jan Nowak-Jeziorański, who had arrived from London, expressed the view that help from the Allies would be limited, but his views received no attention.

Believing that the time for action had arrived, on 31 July, the Polish commanders General Bór-Komorowski and Colonel Antoni Chruściel ordered full mobilization of the forces for 17:00 the following day.
==Opposing forces==

===Polish forces===
The Home Army forces of the Warsaw District numbered between 20,000, and 49,000 soldiers. Other underground formations also contributed; estimates range from 2,000 in total, to about 3,500 men including those from the National Armed Forces and the communist People&#x27;s Army. Most of them had trained for several years in partisan and urban guerrilla warfare, but lacked experience in prolonged daylight fighting. The forces lacked equipment, because the Home Army had shuttled weapons to the east of the country before the decision to include Warsaw in Operation Tempest. Other partisan groups subordinated themselves to Home Army command, and many volunteers joined during the fighting, including Jews freed from the Gęsiówka concentration camp in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto. Morale among Jewish fighters was hurt by displays of antisemitism, with several former Jewish prisoners in combat units even killed by antisemitic Poles.

Colonel Antoni Chruściel (codename &quot;Monter&quot;) who commanded the Polish underground forces in Warsaw, divided his units into eight areas: the Sub-district I of Śródmieście (Area I) which included Warszawa-Śródmieście and the Old Town; the Sub-district II of Żoliborz (Area II) comprising Żoliborz, Marymont, and Bielany; the Sub-district III of Wola (Area III) in Wola; the Sub-district IV of Ochota (Area IV) in Ochota; the Sub-district V of Mokotów (Area V) in Mokotów; the Sub-district VI of Praga (Area VI) in Praga; the Sub-district VII of Warsaw suburbs (Area VII) for the Warsaw West County; and the Autonomous Region VIII of Okęcie (Area VIII) in Okęcie; while the units of the Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion (&quot;Kedyw&quot;) remained attached to the Uprising Headquarters. On 20 September, the sub-districts were reorganized to align with the three areas of the city held by the Polish units. The entire force, renamed the Warsaw Home Army Corps () and commanded by General Antoni Chruściel – who was promoted from Colonel on 14 September – formed three infantry divisions (Śródmieście, Żoliborz and Mokotów).

The exact number of the foreign fighters (&quot;obcokrajowcy&quot; in Polish), who fought in Warsaw for Poland&#x27;s independence, is difficult to determine, taking into consideration the chaotic character of the Uprising causing their irregular registration. It is estimated that they numbered several hundred and represented at least 15 countries – Slovakia, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, the United States, the Soviet Union, South Africa, Romania, Germany, and even Nigeria. These people – emigrants who had settled in Warsaw before the war, escapees from numerous POW, concentration and labor camps, and deserters from the German auxiliary forces – were absorbed in different fighting and supportive formations of the Polish underground. They wore the underground&#x27;s red-white armband (the colors of the Polish national flag) and adopted the Polish traditional independence fighters&#x27; slogan &#x27;Za naszą i waszą wolność&#x27; (For our and your freedom). Some of the &#x27;obcokrajowcy&#x27; showed outstanding bravery in fighting the enemy and were awarded the highest decorations of the AK and the Polish government in exile.

During the fighting, the Poles obtained additional supplies through airdrops and by capture from the enemy, including several armored vehicles, notably two Panther tanks and two Sd.Kfz. 251 armored personnel carriers. Also, resistance workshops produced weapons throughout the fighting, including submachine guns, K pattern flamethrowers, grenades, mortars, and even an armored car (). As of 1 August, Polish military supplies consisted of 1,000 guns, 1,750 pistols, 300 submachine guns, 60 assault rifles, 7 heavy machine guns, 20 anti-tank guns, and 25,000 hand grenades. &quot;Such collection of light weapons might have been sufficient to launch an urban terror campaign, but not to seize control of the city&quot;.

=== Germans ===

In late July 1944 the German units stationed in and around Warsaw were divided into three categories. The first and the most numerous was the garrison of Warsaw. As of 31 July, it numbered some 11,000 troops under General Rainer Stahel.
These well-equipped German forces prepared for the defence of the city&#x27;s key positions for many months. Several hundred concrete bunkers and barbed wire lines protected the buildings and areas occupied by the Germans. Apart from the garrison itself, numerous army units were stationed on both banks of the Vistula river and in the city. The second category was composed of police and SS, under SS and Police Leader SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; Paul Otto Geibel, numbering initially 5,710 men, including &quot;Schutzpolizei&quot; and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. The third category was formed by various auxiliary units, including detachments of the &quot;Bahnschutz&quot; (rail guard), &quot;Werkschutz&quot; (factory guard) and the Polish Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans in Poland) and Soviet former POW of the &quot;Sonderdienst&quot; and &quot;Sonderabteilungen&quot; paramilitary units.

During the uprising the German side received reinforcements on a daily basis. Stahel was replaced as overall commander by SS-General Erich von dem Bach in early August. As of 20 August 1944, the German units directly involved with fighting in Warsaw comprised 17,000 men arranged in two battle groups:
* Battle Group Rohr (commanded by Major General Rohr), which included 1,700 soldiers of the anti-communist S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A. &quot;Russkaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya&quot; (&quot;Russian National Liberation Army&quot;, also known as Kaminski Brigade) under German command made up of Russian, Belorussian and Ukrainian collaborators,
* and Battle Group Reinefarth commanded by SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Heinz Reinefarth, which consisted of Attack Group Dirlewanger (commanded by Oskar Dirlewanger), which included Aserbaidschanische Legion (part of the Ostlegionen), Attack Group Reck (commanded by Major Reck), Attack Group Schmidt (commanded by Colonel Schmidt) and various support and backup units.

The Nazi forces included about 5,000 regular troops; 4,000 Luftwaffe personnel (1,000 at Okęcie airport, 700 at Bielany, 1,000 in Boernerowo, 300 at Służewiec and 1,000 in anti-air artillery posts throughout the city); as well as about 2,000 men of the Sentry Regiment Warsaw (&quot;Wachtregiment Warschau&quot;), including four infantry battalions (&quot;Patz&quot;, &quot;Baltz&quot;, No. 996 and No. 997), and an SS reconnaissance squadron with ca. 350 men.

== Uprising ==
=== W-hour or &quot;Godzina W&quot; ===

After days of hesitation, at 17:00 on 31 July, the Polish headquarters scheduled &quot;W-hour&quot; (from the Polish &quot;wybuch&quot;, &quot;explosion&quot;), the moment of the start of the uprising for 17:00 on the following day. The decision was a strategic miscalculation because the under-equipped resistance forces were prepared and trained for a series of coordinated surprise dawn attacks. In addition, although many units were already mobilized and waiting at assembly points throughout the city, the mobilization of thousands of young men and women was hard to conceal. Fighting started in advance of &quot;W-hour&quot;, notably in Żoliborz, and around Napoleon Square and Dąbrowski Square. The Germans had anticipated the possibility of an uprising, though they had not realized its size or strength. At 16:30 Governor Fischer put the garrison on full alert.

That evening the resistance captured a major German arsenal, the main post office and power station and the Prudential building. However, Castle Square, the police district, and the airport remained in German hands. The first days were crucial in establishing the battlefield for the rest of the fight. The resistance fighters were most successful in the City Centre, Old Town and Wola districts. However, several major German strongholds remained, and in some areas of Wola the Poles sustained heavy losses that forced an early retreat. In other areas such as Mokotów, the attackers almost completely failed to secure any objectives and controlled only the residential areas. In Praga, on the east bank of the Vistula, the Poles were sent back into hiding by a high concentration of German forces. Most crucially, the fighters in different areas failed to link up with each other and with areas outside Warsaw, leaving each sector isolated from the others. After the first hours of fighting, many units adopted a more defensive strategy, while civilians began erecting barricades. Despite all the problems, by 4 August the majority of the city was in Polish hands, although some key strategic points remained untaken.

=== First four days ===


The uprising was intended to last a few days until Soviet forces arrived; however, this never happened, and the Polish forces had to fight with little outside assistance. The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows:
* &quot;Area I&quot; (city centre and the Old Town): Units captured most of their assigned territory, but failed to capture areas with strong pockets of resistance from the Germans (the Warsaw University buildings, PAST skyscraper, the headquarters of the German garrison in the Saxon Palace, the German-only area near Szucha Avenue, and the bridges over the Vistula). They thus failed to create a central stronghold, secure communication links to other areas, or a secure land connection with the northern area of Żoliborz through the northern railway line and the Citadel.
* &quot;Area II&quot; (Żoliborz, Marymont, Bielany): Units failed to secure the most important military targets near Żoliborz. Many units retreated outside of the city, into the forests. Although they captured most of the area around Żoliborz, the soldiers of Colonel Mieczysław Niedzielski (&quot;Żywiciel&quot;) failed to secure the Citadel area and break through German defences at Warsaw Gdańsk railway station.
* &quot;Area III&quot; (Wola): Units initially secured most of the territory, but sustained heavy losses (up to 30%). Some units retreated into the forests, while others retreated to the eastern part of the area. In the northern part of Wola the soldiers of Colonel Jan Mazurkiewicz (&quot;Radosław&quot;) managed to capture the German barracks, the German supply depot at Stawki Street, and the flanking position at the Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery (see Defense of the Wola cemeteries).
* &quot;Area IV&quot; (Ochota): The units mobilized in this area did not capture either the territory or the military targets (the Gęsiówka concentration camp, and the SS and Sipo barracks on Narutowicz Square). After suffering heavy casualties most of the Home Army forces retreated to the forests west of Warsaw. Only two small units of approximately 200 to 300 men under Lieut. Andrzej Chyczewski (&quot;Gustaw&quot;) remained in the area and managed to create strong pockets of resistance. They were later reinforced by units from the city centre. Elite units of the Kedyw managed to secure most of the northern part of the area and captured all of the military targets there. However, they were soon tied down by German tactical counter-attacks from the south and west.
* &quot;Area V&quot; (Mokotów): The situation in this area was very serious from the start of hostilities. The partisans aimed to capture the heavily defended Police Area (&quot;Dzielnica policyjna&quot;) on Rakowiecka Street, and establish a connection with the city centre through open terrain at the former airfield of Mokotów Field. As both of the areas were heavily fortified and could be approached only through open terrain, the assaults failed. Some units retreated into the forests, while others managed to capture parts of Dolny Mokotów, which was, however, severed from most communication routes to other areas.
* &quot;Area VI&quot; (Praga): The Uprising was also started on the right bank of the Vistula, where the main task was to seize the bridges on the river and secure the bridgeheads until the arrival of the Red Army. It was clear that, since the location was far worse than that of the other areas, there was no chance of any help from outside. After some minor initial successes, the forces of Lt.Col. Antoni Żurowski (&quot;Andrzej&quot;) were badly outnumbered by the Germans. The fights were halted, and the Home Army forces were forced back underground.
* &quot;Area VII&quot; (&quot;Powiat warszawski&quot;): this area consisted of territories outside Warsaw city limits. Actions here mostly failed to capture their targets.

An additional area within the Polish command structure was formed by the units of the Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion or &quot;Kedyw&quot;, an elite formation that was to guard the headquarters and was to be used as an &quot;armed ambulance&quot;, thrown into the battle in the most endangered areas. These units secured parts of Śródmieście and Wola; along with the units of &quot;Area I&quot;, they were the most successful during the first few hours.

Among the most notable primary targets that were not taken during the opening stages of the uprising were the airfields of Okęcie and Mokotów Field, as well as the PAST skyscraper overlooking the city centre and the Gdańsk railway station guarding the passage between the centre and the northern borough of Żoliborz.

The leaders of the uprising counted only on the rapid entry of the Red Army in Warsaw (&#x27;on the second or third or, at the latest, by the seventh day of the fighting&#x27;) and were more prepared for a confrontation with the Russians. At this time, the head of the government in exile Mikolajczyk met with Stalin on 3 August 1944 in Moscow and raised the questions of his imminent arrival in Warsaw, the return to power of his government in Poland, as well as the Eastern borders of Poland, while categorically refusing to recognize the Curzon Line as the basis for negotiations. In saying this, Mikolajczyk was well aware that the USSR and Stalin had repeatedly stated their demand for recognition of the Curzon Line as the basis for negotiations and categorically refused to change their position. 23 March 1944 Stalin said &#x27;he could not depart from the Curzon Line; in spite of Churchill&#x27;s post-Teheran reference to his Curzon Line policy as one &#x27;of force&#x27;, he still believed it to be the only legitimate settlement&#x27;. Thus, the Warsaw uprising was actively used to achieve political goals. The question of assistance to the insurrection was not raised by Mikolajczyk, apparently for reasons that it might weaken the position in the negotiations. &#x27;The substance of the two-and-a-half-hour discussion was a harsh disagreement about future of Poland, the Uprising – considered by the Poles as a bargaining chip – turned to be disadvantageous for Mikolajczyk&#x27;s position since it made him seem like a supplicant (...) Nothing was agreed about the Uprising.&#x27; The question of helping the &quot;Home Army&quot; with weapons was only raised, but Stalin refused to discuss this question until the formation of a new government was decided.

=== Wola massacre ===


The Uprising reached its apogee on 4 August when the Home Army soldiers managed to establish front lines in the westernmost boroughs of Wola and Ochota. However, it was also the moment at which the German army stopped its retreat westwards and began receiving reinforcements. On the same day SS General Erich von dem Bach was appointed commander of all the forces employed against the Uprising. German counter-attacks aimed to link up with the remaining German pockets and then cut off the Uprising from the Vistula river. Among the reinforcing units were forces under the command of Heinz Reinefarth.

On 5 August Reinefarth&#x27;s three attack groups started their advance westward along &quot;Wolska&quot; and &quot;Górczewska&quot; streets toward the main east–west communication line of Jerusalem Avenue. Their advance was halted, but the regiments began carrying out Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s orders: behind the lines, special SS, police and &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; groups went from house to house, shooting the inhabitants regardless of age or gender and burning their bodies. Estimates of civilians killed in Wola and Ochota range from 20,000 to 50,000, 40,000 by 8 August in Wola alone, or as high as 100,000. The main perpetrators were Oskar Dirlewanger and Bronislav Kaminski, whose forces committed the cruelest atrocities.

Atrocities included multiple crowds of men and women being gunned down in churchyards. Householders were pulled into the streets to be butchered with bayonets and sabres. Pregnant women were drawn and quartered. Children were also chopped to pieces.

The policy was designed to crush the Poles&#x27; will to fight and put the uprising to an end without having to commit to heavy city fighting. With time, the Germans realized that atrocities only stiffened resistance and that some political solution should be found, as the thousands of men at the disposal of the German commander were unable to effectively counter the resistance in an urban guerrilla setting. They aimed to gain a significant victory to show the Home Army the futility of further fighting and induce them to surrender. This did not succeed. Until mid-September, the Germans shot all captured resistance fighters on the spot, but from the end of September, some of the captured Polish soldiers were treated as POWs.

=== Stalemate ===


Despite the loss of Wola, the Polish resistance strengthened. &quot;Zośka&quot; and &quot;Wacek&quot; battalions managed to capture the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto and liberate the Gęsiówka concentration camp, freeing about 350 Jews. The area became one of the main communication links between the resistance fighting in Wola and those defending the Old Town. On 7 August German forces were strengthened by the arrival of tanks using civilians as human shields. After two days of heavy fighting they managed to bisect Wola and reach Bankowy Square. However, by then the net of barricades, street fortifications, and tank obstacles were already well-prepared; both sides reached a stalemate, with heavy house-to-house fighting.

Between 9 and 18 August pitched battles raged around the Old Town and nearby Bankowy Square, with successful attacks by the Germans and counter-attacks from the Poles. German tactics hinged on bombardment through the use of heavy artillery and tactical bombers, against which the Poles were unable to effectively defend, as they lacked anti-aircraft artillery weapons. Even clearly marked hospitals were dive-bombed by Stukas.

Although the Battle of Stalingrad had already shown the danger a city can pose to armies which fight within it and the importance of local support, the Warsaw Uprising was probably the first demonstration that in an urban terrain, a vastly under-equipped force supported by the civilian population can hold its own against better-equipped professional soldiersthough at the cost of considerable sacrifice on the part of the city&#x27;s residents.

The Poles held the Old Town until a decision to withdraw was made at the end of August. On successive nights until 2 September, the defenders of the Old Town withdrew through the sewers, which were a major means of communication between different parts of the Uprising. Thousands of people were evacuated in this way. Those that remained were either shot or transported to concentration camps like Mauthausen and Sachsenhausen once the Germans regained control.

=== Berling&#x27;s landings ===
Soviet attacks on the 4th SS Panzer Corps east of Warsaw were renewed on 26 August, and the Germans were forced to retreat into Praga. The Soviet army under the command of Konstantin Rokossovsky captured Praga and arrived on the east bank of the Vistula in mid-September. By 13 September, the Germans had destroyed the remaining bridges over the Vistula, signalling that they were abandoning all their positions east of the river. In the Praga area, Polish units under the command of General Zygmunt Berling (thus sometimes known as &quot;berlingowcy&quot; – &quot;the Berling men&quot;) fought on the Soviet side. Three patrols of his First Polish Army () landed in the Czerniaków and Powiśle areas and made contact with Home Army forces on the night of 14/15 September. The artillery cover and air support provided by the Soviets was unable to effectively counter enemy machine-gun fire as the Poles crossed the river, and the landing troops sustained heavy losses. Only small elements of the main units made it ashore (I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment, 3rd Infantry Division).

The limited landings by the 1st Polish Army represented the only external ground force which arrived to physically support the uprising; and even they were curtailed by the Soviet High Command due to the losses they took.

The Germans intensified their attacks on the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings, but were not able to make any significant advances for several days while Polish forces held those vital positions in preparation for a new expected wave of Soviet landings. Polish units from the eastern shore attempted several more landings, and from 15 to 23 September sustained heavy losses (including the destruction of all their landing boats and most of their other river crossing equipment). Red Army support was inadequate. After the failure of repeated attempts by the 1st Polish Army to link up with the resistance, the Soviets limited their assistance to sporadic artillery and air support. Conditions that prevented the Germans from dislodging the resistance also acted to prevent the Poles from dislodging the Germans. Plans for a river crossing were suspended &quot;for at least 4 months&quot;, since operations against the 9th Army&#x27;s five panzer divisions were problematic at that point, and the commander of the 1st Polish Army, General Berling was relieved of his duties by his Soviet superiors.

On the night of 19 September, after no further attempts from the other side of the river were made and the promised evacuation of wounded did not take place, Home Army soldiers and landed elements of the 1st Polish Army were forced to begin a retreat from their positions on the bank of the river. Out of approximately 900 men who made it ashore only a handful made it back to the eastern shore of the Vistula. Berling&#x27;s Polish Army losses in the attempt to aid the Uprising were 5,660 killed, missing or wounded. From this point on, the Warsaw Uprising can be seen as a one-sided war of attrition or, alternatively, as a fight for acceptable terms of surrender. The Poles were besieged in three areas of the city: Śródmieście, Żoliborz and Mokotów.

== Life behind the lines ==

In 1939 Warsaw had roughly 1,350,000 inhabitants. Over a million were still living in the city at the start of the Uprising. In Polish-controlled territory, during the first weeks of the Uprising, people tried to recreate the normal day-to-day life of their free country. Cultural life was vibrant, both among the soldiers and civilian population, with theatres, post offices, newspapers and similar activities. Boys and girls of the Polish Scouts acted as couriers for an underground postal service, risking their lives daily to transmit any information that might help their people. Near the end of the Uprising, lack of food and medicine, overcrowding and indiscriminate German air and artillery assault on the city made the civilian situation more and more desperate. Booby traps, such as thermite-laced candy pieces, may have also been used in German-controlled districts of Warsaw; targeting Polish youth.

=== Food shortages ===
As the Uprising was supposed to be relieved by the Soviets in a matter of days, the Polish underground did not predict food shortages would be a problem. However, as the fighting dragged on, the inhabitants of the city faced hunger and starvation. A major break-through took place on 6 August, when Polish units recaptured the Haberbusch i Schiele brewery complex at Ceglana Street. From that time on the citizens of Warsaw lived mostly on barley from the brewery&#x27;s warehouses. Every day up to several thousand people organized into cargo teams reported to the brewery for bags of barley and then distributed them in the city centre. The barley was then ground in coffee grinders and boiled with water to form a so-called spit-soup (). The &quot;Sowiński&quot; Battalion managed to hold the brewery until the end of the fighting.

Another serious problem for civilians and soldiers alike was a shortage of water. By mid-August most of the water conduits were either out of order or filled with corpses. In addition, the main water pumping station remained in German hands. To prevent the spread of epidemics and provide the people with water, the authorities ordered all janitors to supervise the construction of water wells in the backyards of every house. On 21 September the Germans blew up the remaining pumping stations at Koszykowa Street and after that the public wells were the only source of potable water in the besieged city. By the end of September, the city centre had more than 90 functioning wells.

=== Polish media ===

Before the Uprising the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Home Army had set up a group of war correspondents. Headed by Antoni Bohdziewicz, the group made three newsreels and over 30,000 meters of film tape documenting the struggles. The first newsreel was shown to the public on 13 August in the Palladium cinema at Złota Street. In addition to films, dozens of newspapers appeared from the first days of the uprising. Several previously underground newspapers started to be distributed openly. The two main daily newspapers were the government-run &quot;Rzeczpospolita Polska&quot; and military &quot;Biuletyn Informacyjny&quot;. There were also several dozen newspapers, magazines, bulletins and weeklies published routinely by various organizations and military units.

The &quot;Błyskawica&quot; long-range radio transmitter, assembled on 7 August in the city centre, was run by the military, but was also used by the recreated Polish Radio from 9 August. It was on the air three or four times a day, broadcasting news programmes and appeals for help in Polish, English, German and French, as well as reports from the government, patriotic poems and music. It was the only such radio station in German-held Europe. Among the speakers appearing on the resistance radio were Jan Nowak-Jeziorański, Zbigniew Świętochowski, Stefan Sojecki, Jeremi Przybora, and John Ward, a war correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; of London.

== Outside support ==

According to many historians, a major cause of the eventual failure of the uprising was the almost complete lack of outside support and the late arrival of that which did arrive. The Polish government-in-exile carried out frantic diplomatic efforts to gain support from the Western Allies prior to the start of battle but the allies would not act without Soviet approval. The Polish government in London asked the British several times to send an allied mission to Poland. However, the British mission did not arrive until December 1944. Shortly after their arrival, they met up with Soviet authorities, who arrested and imprisoned them. In the words of the mission&#x27;s deputy commander, it was &quot;a complete failure&quot;. Nevertheless, from August 1943 to July 1944, over 200 British Royal Air Force (RAF) flights dropped an estimated 146 Polish personnel trained in Great Britain, over 4,000 containers of supplies, and $16 million in banknotes and gold to the Home Army.

The only support operation which ran continuously for the duration of the Uprising were night supply drops by long-range planes of the RAF, other British Commonwealth air forces, and units of the Polish Air Force, which had to use distant airfields in Italy, reducing the amount of supplies they could carry. The RAF made 223 sorties and lost 34 aircraft. The effect of these airdrops was mostly psychologicalthey delivered too few supplies for the needs of the resistance, and many airdrops landed outside Polish-controlled territory.

=== Airdrops ===

From 4 August the Western Allies began supporting the Uprising with airdrops of munitions and other supplies. Initially the flights were carried out mostly by the &quot;1568th Polish Special Duties Flight&quot; of the Polish Air Force (later renamed No. 301 Polish Bomber Squadron) stationed in Bari and Brindisi in Italy, flying B-24 Liberator, Handley Page Halifax and Douglas C-47 Dakota planes. Later on, at the insistence of the Polish government-in-exile, they were joined by the Liberators of 2 Wing – No.31 and No. 34 Squadrons of the South African Air Force based at Foggia in Southern Italy, and Halifaxes, flown by No. 148 and No. 178 RAF Squadrons. The drops by British, Polish and South African forces continued until 21 September. The total weight of allied drops varies according to source (104 tons, 230 tons or 239 tons), over 200 flights were made.

The Soviet Union did not allow the Western Allies to use its airports for the airdrops for several weeks, so the planes had to use bases in the United Kingdom and Italy which reduced their carrying weight and number of sorties. The Allies&#x27; specific request for the use of landing strips made on 20 August was denied by Stalin on 22 August. Stalin referred to the Polish resistance as &quot;a handful of criminals&quot; and stated that the Uprising was inspired by &quot;enemies of the Soviet Union&quot;. Thus, by denying landing rights to Allied aircraft on Soviet-controlled territory the Soviets vastly limited effectiveness of Allied assistance to the Uprising, and even fired at Allied airplanes which carried supplies from Italy and strayed into Soviet-controlled airspace.

American support was also limited. After Stalin&#x27;s objections to supporting the uprising, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill telegraphed U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 25 August and proposed sending planes in defiance of Stalin, to &quot;see what happens&quot;. Unwilling to upset Stalin before the Yalta Conference, Roosevelt replied on 26 August: &quot;I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range general war prospect for me to join you&quot;.


Finally on 18 September the Soviets allowed a USAAF flight of 107 B-17 Flying Fortresses of the Eighth Air Force&#x27;s 3rd Division to re-fuel and reload at Soviet airfields used in Operation Frantic, but it was too little too late. The planes dropped 100 tons of supplies but only 20 were recovered by the resistance due to the wide area over which they were spread. The vast majority of supplies fell into German-held areas. The USAAF lost two B-17s with a further seven damaged. The aircraft landed at the Operation Frantic airbases in the Soviet Union, where they were rearmed and refueled, and the next day 100 B-17s and 61 P-51s left the USSR to bomb the marshalling yard at Szolnok in Hungary on their way back to bases in Italy. Soviet intelligence reports show that Soviet commanders on the ground near Warsaw estimated that 96% of the supplies dropped by the Americans fell into German hands. From the Soviet perspective, the Americans were supplying the Nazis instead of aiding the Polish resistance. The Soviets refused permission for any further American flights until 30 September, by which time the weather was too poor to fly, and the Uprising was nearly over.

Between 13 and 30 September Soviet aircraft commenced their own re-supply missions, dropping arms, medicines and food supplies. Initially these supplies were dropped in canisters without parachutes which led to damage and loss of the contents. Also, a large number of canisters fell into German hands. The Soviet Air Forces flew 2,535 re-supply sorties with small bi-plane Polikarpov Po-2&#x27;s, delivering a total of 156 50-mm mortars, 505 anti-tank rifles, 1,478 sub-machine guns, 520 rifles, 669 carbines, 41,780 hand grenades, 37,216 mortar shells, over 3 million cartridges, 131.2 tons of food and 515 kg of medicine.

Although German air defence over the Warsaw area itself was almost non-existent, about 12% of the 296 planes taking part in the operations were lost because they had to fly out and the same distance back over heavily defended enemy territory (112 out of 637 Polish and 133 out of 735 British and South African airmen were shot down). Most of the drops were made during the night, at no more than altitude, and poor accuracy left many parachuted packages stranded behind German-controlled territory (only about 50 tons of supplies, less than 50% delivered, was recovered by the resistance).

The level of losses during the operation was very high, especially for the conditions of mid-1944. In the first flight on 4–5 August, 5 out of 7 aircraft were lost. In subsequent flights, the level of losses decreased, but remained very high. For example, on 13–14 August, 3 planes out of 28 were shot down, and 4 planes were forced to make forced landings in territories occupied by the USSR due to damage.

=== Soviet stance ===


The role of the Red Army during the Warsaw Uprising remains controversial and is still disputed by historians. The Uprising started when the Red Army appeared on the city&#x27;s doorstep, and the Poles in Warsaw were counting on Soviet front capturing or forwarding beyond the city in a matter of days. This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans, launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces, played out successfully in a number of European capitals, such as Paris and Prague. However, despite easy capture of area south-east of Warsaw barely from the city centre and holding these positions for about 40 days, the Soviets did not extend any effective aid to the resistance within Warsaw. At that time city outskirts were defended by the under-manned and under-equipped German 73rd Infantry Division which was destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and was yet-again being reconstituted. The weak German defence forces did not experience any significant Soviet pressure during that period, which effectively allowed them to strengthen German forces fighting against uprising in the city itself.

The Red Army was fighting intense battles further to the south of Warsaw, to seize and maintain bridgeheads over the Vistula river, and to the north of the city, to gain bridgeheads over the river Narew. The best German armoured divisions were fighting on those sectors. Despite the fact, both of these objectives had been mostly secured by September. Yet the Soviet 47th Army did not move into Praga on the right bank of the Vistula, until 11 September (when the Uprising was basically over). In three days the Soviets quickly gained control of the suburb, a few hundred meters from the main battle on the other side of the river, as the resistance by the German 73rd Division collapsed quickly. Had the Soviets done this in early August, the crossing of the river would have been easier, as the Poles then held considerable stretches of the riverfront. However, by mid-September a series of German attacks had reduced the Poles to holding one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of Czerniaków. The Poles were counting on the Soviet forces to cross to the left bank where the main battle of the uprising was occurring. Though Berling&#x27;s communist 1st Polish Army did cross the river, their support from the Soviets was inadequate and the main Soviet force did not follow them.

One of the reasons given for the collapse of the Uprising was the reluctance of the Soviet Red Army to help the Polish resistance. On 1 August, the day of Uprising, the Soviet advance was halted by a direct order from the Kremlin. Soon afterwards the Soviet tank units stopped receiving any oil from their depots. Soviets knew of the planned outbreak from their agents in Warsaw and, more importantly, directly from the Polish Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk, who informed them of the Polish Home Army uprising plans:
The Soviet side was informed post-factum. &quot;The Russians learned about possibility for the first time from Mikolajczyk, at about 9 p.m. on 31 July, that is about 3 hours after Bor-Komorowski had given the order for the insurrection to begin&quot;.

One way or the other, the presence of Soviet tanks in nearby Wołomin 15 kilometers to the east of Warsaw had sealed the decision of the Home Army leaders to launch the Uprising. However, as a result of the initial battle of Radzymin in the final days of July, these advance units of the Soviet 2nd Tank Army were pushed out of Wołomin and back about . On 9 August, Stalin informed Premier Mikołajczyk that the Soviets had originally planned to be in Warsaw by 6 August, but a counter-attack by four Panzer divisions had thwarted their attempts to reach the city. By 10 August, the Germans had enveloped and inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviet 2nd Tank Army at Wołomin.

On 1 August 1944, the underground Polish Home Army, being in contact with and loyal to the Polish government-in-exile in London, began offensive operations in Warsaw, in an attempt to free the city from the occupying German forces before the Red Army could secure the capital. Zygmunt Berling became the deputy commander of the Polish Army in the USSR on 22 July 1944. With his own army stopped on the Vistula River and facing Warsaw itself, and without first consulting his Soviet superiors, Berling may have independently issued orders to engage the German enemy and to come to the aid of the Polish resistance but it was a small landing without any tactical support from Berling or other Soviet units that could not make a difference in the situation of Warsaw. Yet this behaviour may have caused Berlings&#x27; dismissal from his post soon after.

When Stalin and Churchill met face-to-face in October 1944, Stalin told Churchill that the lack of Soviet support was a direct result of a major reverse in the Vistula sector in August, which had to be kept secret for strategic reasons. All contemporary German sources assumed that the Soviets were trying to link up with the resistance, and they believed it was their defence that prevented the Soviet advance rather than a reluctance to advance on the part of the Soviets. Nevertheless, as part of their strategy the Germans published propaganda accusing both the British and Soviets of abandoning the Poles.

The Soviet units which reached the outskirts of Warsaw in the final days of July 1944 had advanced from the 1st Belorussian Front in Western Ukraine as part of the Lublin–Brest Offensive, between the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive on its left and Operation Bagration on its right. These two flanking operations were colossal defeats for the German army and completely destroyed a large number of German formations. As a consequence, the Germans at this time were desperately trying to put together a new force to hold the line of the Vistula, the last major river barrier between the Red Army and Germany proper, rushing in units in various stages of readiness from all over Europe. These included many infantry units of poor quality, and 4–5 high quality Panzer Divisions in the 39th Panzer Corps and 4th SS Panzer Corps pulled from their refits.

Other explanations for Soviet conduct are possible. The Red Army geared for a major thrust into the Balkans through Romania in mid-August and a large proportion of Soviet resources was sent in that direction, while the offensive in Poland was put on hold. Stalin had made a strategic decision to concentrate on occupying Eastern Europe, rather than on making a thrust toward Germany. The capture of Warsaw was not essential for the Soviets, as they had already seized a series of convenient bridgeheads to the south of Warsaw, and were concentrating on defending them against vigorous German counterattacks. Finally, the Soviet High Command may not have developed a coherent or appropriate strategy with regard to Warsaw because they were badly misinformed. Propaganda from the Polish Committee of National Liberation minimized the strength of the Home Army and portrayed them as Nazi sympathizers. Information submitted to Stalin by intelligence operatives or gathered from the frontline was often inaccurate or omitted key details. Possibly because the operatives were unable, due to the harsh political climate, to express opinions or report facts honestly, they &quot;deliberately resorted to writing nonsense&quot;.

According to David Glantz (military historian and a retired US Army colonel, as well as a member of the Russian Federation&#x27;s Academy of Natural Sciences), the Red Army was simply unable to extend effective support to the uprising, which began too early, regardless of Stalin&#x27;s political intentions. German military capabilities in Augustearly September were sufficient to halt any Soviet assistance to the Poles in Warsaw, were it intended. In addition, Glantz argued that Warsaw would be a costly city to clear of Germans and an unsuitable location as a start point for subsequent Red Army offensives.

Declassified documents from Soviet archives reveal that Stalin gave instructions to cut off the Warsaw resistance from any outside help. The urgent orders issued to the Red Army troops in Poland on 23 August 1944 stipulated that the Home Army units in Soviet-controlled areas should be prevented from reaching Warsaw and helping the Uprising, their members apprehended and disarmed. Only from mid-September, under pressure from the Western Allies, did the Soviets began to provide some limited assistance to the resistance.

Modern Russian historians generally hold the view that the failure of the uprising in Warsaw was caused primarily by the mistakes of the leadership of the uprising. They argue that in July 1944, according to the Directive of the command, the Soviet troops did not have the goal of attacking Warsaw, but only to the suburbs of Warsaw – Praga with access to the Vistula river line. Since the Soviet command understood that it was unlikely to be possible to capture the bridges over the Vistula and the Germans would blow them up. The Soviet forces aimed to advance in the northern direction with the capture of East Prussia and with the priority task of reaching the line of the Vistula and Narew rivers and capturing bridgeheads. Then the offensive against East Prussia was to begin from these bridgeheads. (&quot;on the West Bank of the Narew river in the area of Pultusk, Serotsk and South and North of Warsaw – on the West Bank of the Vistula river in the area of Demblin, Zvolen, Solec. In the future keep in mind to advance in the General direction of Thorn and Lodz&quot;).

According to this argument, the Home Army leadership mistook the left flank of the 2nd Tank army, which was advancing to north, for the vanguard, which was allegedly advancing on Warsaw and the order was given to start the uprising, which led to defeat. Modern Russian historians generally blame this lack of coordination on the Home Army&#x27;s desire to liberate Warsaw before the Soviets arrived there.

==Aftermath==
===Capitulation===


By the first week of September both German and Polish commanders realized that the Soviet army was unlikely to act to break the stalemate. The Germans reasoned that a prolonged Uprising would damage their ability to hold Warsaw as the frontline; the Poles were concerned that continued resistance would result in further massive casualties. On 7 September, General Rohr proposed negotiations, which Bór-Komorowski agreed to pursue the following day. Over 8, 9 and 10 September about 20,000 civilians were evacuated by agreement of both sides, and Rohr recognized the right of Home Army soldiers to be treated as military combatants. The Poles suspended talks on the 11th, as they received news that the Soviets were advancing slowly through Praga. A few days later, the arrival of the 1st Polish army breathed new life into the resistance and the talks collapsed.

However, by the morning of 27 September, the Germans had retaken Mokotów. Talks restarted on 28 September. In the evening of 30 September, Żoliborz fell to the Germans. The Poles were being pushed back into fewer and fewer streets, and their situation was ever more desperate. On the 30th, Hitler decorated von dem Bach, Dirlewanger and Reinefarth, while in London General Sosnkowski was dismissed as Polish commander-in-chief. Bór-Komorowski was promoted in his place, even though he was trapped in Warsaw. Bór-Komorowski and Prime Minister Mikołajczyk again appealed directly to Rokossovsky and Stalin for a Soviet intervention. None came. According to Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov, who was by this time at the Vistula front, both he and Rokossovsky advised Stalin against an offensive because of heavy Soviet losses.

The capitulation order of the remaining Polish forces was finally signed on 2 October. All fighting ceased that evening. According to the agreement, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; promised to treat Home Army soldiers in accordance with the Geneva Convention, and to treat the civilian population humanely.

The next day the Germans began to disarm the Home Army soldiers. They later sent 15,000 of them to POW camps in various parts of Germany. Between 5,000 and 6,000 resistance fighters decided to blend into the civilian population hoping to continue the fight later. The entire civilian population of Warsaw was expelled from the city and sent to a transit camp &quot;Durchgangslager&quot; 121 in Pruszków. Out of 350,000–550,000 civilians who passed through the camp, 90,000 were sent to labour camps in the Third Reich, 60,000 were shipped to death and concentration camps (including Ravensbrück, Auschwitz, and Mauthausen, among others), while the rest were transported to various locations in the General Government and released.

The Eastern Front remained static in the Vistula sector, with the Soviets making no attempt to push forward, until the Vistula–Oder Offensive began on 12 January 1945. Almost entirely destroyed, Warsaw was liberated from the Germans on 17 January 1945 by the Red Army and the First Polish Army.

===Destruction of the city===

The destruction of the Polish capital was planned before the start of World War II. On 20 June 1939, while Adolf Hitler was visiting an architectural bureau in Würzburg am Main, his attention was captured by a project of a future German town – &quot;Neue deutsche Stadt Warschau&quot;. According to the Pabst Plan Warsaw was to be turned into a provincial German city. It was soon included as a part of the great Germanization plan of the East; the genocidal &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;. The failure of the Warsaw Uprising provided an opportunity for Hitler to begin the transformation.

After the remaining population had been expelled, the Germans continued the destruction of the city. Special groups of German engineers were dispatched to burn and demolish the remaining buildings. According to German plans, after the war Warsaw was to be turned into nothing more than a military transit station, or even an artificial lake – the latter of which the Nazi leadership had already intended to implement for the Soviet/Russian capital of Moscow in 1941. The &quot;Brandkommandos&quot; (arson squads) used flamethrowers and &quot;Sprengkommandos&quot; (demolition squads) explosives to methodically destroy house after house. They paid special attention to historical monuments, Polish national archives and places of interest.

By January 1945, 85% of the buildings were destroyed: 25% as a result of the Uprising, 35% as a result of systematic German actions after the uprising, and the rest as a result of the earlier Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, and the September 1939 campaign. Material losses are estimated at 10,455 buildings, 923 historical buildings (94%), 25 churches, 14 libraries including the National Library, 81 primary schools, 64 high schools, University of Warsaw and Warsaw University of Technology, and most of the historical monuments. Almost a million inhabitants lost all of their possessions. The exact amount of losses of private and public property as well as pieces of art, monuments of science and culture is unknown but considered enormous. Studies done in the late 1940s estimated total damage at about US$30 billion. In 2004, President of Warsaw Lech Kaczyński, later President of Poland, established a historical commission to estimate material losses that were inflicted upon the city by German authorities. The commission estimated the losses as at least US$31.5 billion at 2004 values. Those estimates were later raised to US$45 billion 2004 US dollars and in 2005, to $54.6 billion.

===Casualties (including both Uprising civilian soldiers and civilians)===

The exact number of casualties on both sides is unknown. Estimates of Polish casualties fall into roughly similar ranges.

Estimates of German casualties differ widely. Though the figure of 9,000 German WIA is generally accepted and generates no controversy, there is little agreement as to German irrecoverable losses (KIA+MIA). Until the 1990s the Eastern and the Western historiography stuck to two widely different estimates, the former claiming 17,000 and the latter 2,000. The 17,000 figure was first coined by a 1947 issue of a Warsaw historical journal &quot;Dzieje Najnowsze&quot;, allegedly based on estimates made by Bach Zelewski when interrogated by his Polish captors (and divided into 10,000 KIA and 7,000 MIA). This figure was initially repeated in West Germany. However, in 1962 a scholarly monograph by Hanns Krannhals coined the 2,000 estimate.

Until the late 20th century the 17,000 figure was consistently and unequivocally quoted in the Polish, though also in the East German and Soviet historiography, be it encyclopedias, scientific monographs or more popular works. It was at times paired or otherwise related to the figure of 16,000 German Warsaw KIA+MIA listed by the so-called &quot;Gehlen report&quot; of April 1945. The 2,000 figure was accepted in West Germany and generally spilled over to Western historiography; exceptions were studies written in English by the Poles and some other works.

Komorowski, who in 1995 opted for 16,000, changed his mind and 10 years later cautiously subscribed to the 2,000 figure; also scholars like Sawicki and Rozwadowski tentatively followed suit. A popular work of Bączyk, who concludes that 3,000 is the maximum conceivable (though not the most probable) figure. In his 2016 analysis Sowa dismissed the 17,000 figure as &quot;entirely improbable&quot; and suggested that its longevity and popularity resulted from manipulation on part of apologists of the Rising.

In the Russian historiography it is given clear preference, be it in encyclopedias and dictionaries or general works; the same opinion might be found in Belorussia. The 17,000 estimate made it also to the English literature, quoted with no reservations in popular compendia, warfare manuals and a handful of other works. The figure is advanced also by established institutions like BBC. Other works in English offer a number of approaches; some quote both sides with no own preference, some provide ambiguous descriptions, some set 17,000 irrecoverable losses as an upper limit, some provide odd numbers perhaps resulting from incompetent quotations and some remain silent on the issue altogether, which is the case of the only major English monograph.

A key argument supporting the 17,000 figure – apart from quotations from Bach and Gehlen – are total (KIA+MIA+WIA) losses sustained by Kampfgruppe Dirlewanger, one of a few operational units forming German troops fighting the Poles. They are currently calculated at some 3,500; if extrapolated, they might support the overall 25,000 German casualty estimate.

===After the war===



Most soldiers of the Home Army (including those who took part in the Warsaw Uprising) were persecuted after the war; captured by the NKVD or UB political police. They were interrogated and imprisoned on various charges, such as that of fascism. Many of them were sent to Gulags, executed or disappeared. Between 1944 and 1956, all of the former members of Battalion Zośka were incarcerated in Soviet prisons. In March 1945, a staged trial of 16 leaders of the Polish Underground State held by the Soviet Union took place in Moscow – (the Trial of the Sixteen). The Government Delegate, together with most members of the Council of National Unity and the C-i-C of the Armia Krajowa, were invited by Soviet general Ivan Serov with agreement of Joseph Stalin to a conference on their eventual entry to the Soviet-backed Provisional Government.

They were presented with a warrant of safety, yet they were arrested in Pruszków by the NKVD on 27 and 28 March. Leopold Okulicki, Jan Stanisław Jankowski and Kazimierz Pużak were arrested on the 27th with 12 more the next day. A. Zwierzynski had been arrested earlier. They were brought to Moscow for interrogation in the Lubyanka. After several months of brutal interrogation and torture, they were presented with the forged accusations of collaboration with Nazis and planning a military alliance with Germany. Many resistance fighters, captured by the Germans and sent to POW camps in Germany, were later liberated by British, American and Polish forces and remained in the West. Among those were the leaders of the uprising Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski and Antoni Chruściel.

The Soviet government labelled all S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A. &quot;Russkaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya&quot; soldiers as traitors, and those who were repatriated were tried and sentenced to detention in Soviet prisons or executed. In the 1950s and 1960s in the USSR, dozens of other former R.O.N.A. members were found, some of them also sentenced to death.
The facts of the Warsaw Uprising were inconvenient to Stalin, and were twisted by propaganda of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, which stressed the failings of the Home Army and the Polish government-in-exile, and forbade all criticism of the Red Army or the political goals of Soviet strategy. In the immediate post-war period, the very name of the Home Army was censored, and most films and novels covering the 1944 Uprising were either banned or modified so that the name of the Home Army did not appear. From the 1950s on, Polish propaganda depicted the soldiers of the Uprising as brave, but the officers as treacherous, reactionary and characterized by disregard of the losses. The first publications on the topic taken seriously in the West were not issued until the late 1980s. In Warsaw no monument to the Home Army was built until 1989. Instead, efforts of the Soviet-backed People&#x27;s Army were glorified and exaggerated.

By contrast, in the West the story of the Polish fight for Warsaw was told as a tale of valiant heroes fighting against a cruel and ruthless enemy. It was suggested that Stalin benefited from Soviet non-involvement, as opposition to eventual Soviet control of Poland was effectively eliminated when the Nazis destroyed the partisans. The belief that the Uprising failed because of deliberate procrastination by the Soviet Union contributed to anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland. Memories of the Uprising helped to inspire the Polish labour movement Solidarity, which led a peaceful opposition movement against the Communist government during the 1980s.

=== 1989 to present ===
In December 1989, the Polish Constitution was revised to remove reference to the socialist order. Marxist references from the Soviet occupation were removed and the name of the country was changed back to the Polish Republic. For the first time since 1944, the Warsaw Uprising could be discussed, researched, and memorialized.

Numerous issues have made research into the Warsaw Uprising difficult. Understanding was boosted by the revolutions of 1989 due to the abolition of censorship and increased access to state archives. Yet access to some material in British, Polish and ex-Soviet archives was still restricted, with some records still classified. According to the British Government, other records of the Polish government were destroyed.

On 1 August 1994, Poland held a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Uprising to which both the German and Russian presidents were invited. Guests included German President Roman Herzog and U.S. Vice President Al Gore. The Russian President Boris Yeltsin declined the invitation. At the 1994 President Herzog, on behalf of Germany, was the first German statesman to apologize for German atrocities committed against the Polish nation during the Uprising. During the 60th anniversary of the Uprising in 2004, official delegations included German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, UK deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and US Secretary of State Colin Powell; Pope John Paul II sent a letter to the mayor of Warsaw, Lech Kaczyński, on this occasion. Russia once again did not send a representative. A day before, 31 July 2004, the Warsaw Uprising Museum opened in Warsaw.

==Warsaw Uprising Memorial Day==
Efforts by President Lech Kaczyński in 2009 led to recognition of August 1 as a State holiday, Narodowy Dzień Pamięci Powstania Warszawskiego.

The preamble of the act reads:

In honour of the heroes of the Warsaw Uprising - those who, in defence of the state, fought for the liberation of the capital city with weapons in their hands, strived to recreate the institutions of an independent Polish state, opposed the German occupation and the spectre of Soviet slavery threatening the next generations of Poles

A moment of silence is observed at 5:00 pm to symbolize the sires of August 1, 1944 at 5:00pm that marked the start of the battle as a signal to resistance fighters. Torches get lit in Warsaw&#x27;s main square amidst rows of national white and red flags while honorary guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Piłsudski Square present arms. Varsovians light firecrackers. Past memorials observers have linked arms to form a human kotwica in front of the Royal Castle.

==Popular culture: music, television and cinema==
Numerous works have been influenced by and devoted to the Uprising. In literature, they include: &quot;Kolumbowie. Rocznik 20&quot; novel by Polish writer Roman Bratny.

In television, they include documentary film &quot;The Ramparts of Warsaw 1943–44&quot;, produced for the 70th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising with support from the European Commission. The Warsaw Uprising is often confused with the revolt in the Warsaw Ghetto which took place a year earlier in the spring of 1943. Three young Europeans, Alexandra (France), Maria (Poland) and Roman (Germany) meet in Warsaw to enquire into these events; here they meet witnesses who took part in the Warsaw Uprising or lived in the ghetto. Beneath their white hair we can recognise the men and women who formed the living ramparts of freedom in the face of Nazism. Meanwhile, the Polish World War II TV drama series &quot;Time of Honor&quot; (; Series 7), which aired in 2014, was entirely devoted to the Warsaw Uprising.

In cinema, they include:
* &quot;Kanał&quot;, a 1956 Polish film directed by Andrzej Wajda. It was the first film made about the Warsaw Uprising, telling the story of a company of Home Army resistance fighters escaping the Nazi onslaught through the city&#x27;s sewers.
* A 2014 film, &quot;Warsaw Uprising&quot;, directed by Jan Komasa and produced by the Warsaw Uprising Museum, was created entirely from restored and colourised film footage taken during the uprising. Komasa followed this up with &quot;Warsaw 44&quot; (also known as &quot;Miasto 44&quot;, &quot;City 44&quot;), a story of love, friendship and the pursuit of adventure during the bloody and brutal reality of the uprising, which was a huge box office success in Poland in 2014.
* Roman Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;The Pianist&quot; also briefly shows the uprising through the eyes of its main character Władysław Szpilman. Polish director Małgorzata Brama stated he intends to shoot a docudrama about the Warsaw Uprising.
* Niki Caro&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;The Zookeeper&#x27;s Wife&quot; depicts the Warsaw Uprising and Jan Żabiński&#x27;s participation in it. At the end of the film, the viewer is informed that Warsaw was destroyed during the war and that only six percent of the Polish capital&#x27;s prewar population was still in the city after the uprising.
* &quot;Warsaw&quot;, a 2019 turn-based tactical role-playing videogame developed and published by Polish studio Pixelated Milk, set during the uprising.
* The second film of Yuri Ozerov&#x27;s epic &quot;Soldiers of Freedom&quot; of 1977 is mostly devoted to the uprising in Warsaw. The presentation of historical events is given from the Soviet point of view.

<text>In condensed matter physics, a Cooper pair or BCS pair (Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer pair) is a pair of electrons (or other fermions) bound together at low temperatures in a certain manner first described in 1956 by American physicist Leon Cooper.

==Description==
Cooper showed that an arbitrarily small attraction between electrons in a metal can cause a paired state of electrons to have a lower energy than the Fermi energy, which implies that the pair is bound. In conventional superconductors, this attraction is due to the electron–phonon interaction. The Cooper pair state is responsible for superconductivity, as described in the BCS theory developed by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer for which they shared the 1972 Nobel Prize.

Although Cooper pairing is a quantum effect, the reason for the pairing can be seen from a simplified classical explanation. An electron in a metal normally behaves as a free particle. The electron is repelled from other electrons due to their negative charge, but it also attracts the positive ions that make up the rigid lattice of the metal. This attraction distorts the ion lattice, moving the ions slightly toward the electron, increasing the positive charge density of the lattice in the vicinity. This positive charge can attract other electrons. At long distances, this attraction between electrons due to the displaced ions can overcome the electrons&#x27; repulsion due to their negative charge, and cause them to pair up. The rigorous quantum mechanical explanation shows that the effect is due to electron–phonon interactions, with the phonon being the collective motion of the positively-charged lattice.

The energy of the pairing interaction is quite weak, of the order of 10−3 eV, and thermal energy can easily break the pairs. So only at low temperatures, in metal and other substrates, are a significant number of the electrons bound in Cooper pairs.

The electrons in a pair are not necessarily close together; because the interaction is long range, paired electrons may still be many hundreds of nanometers apart. This distance is usually greater than the average interelectron distance so that many Cooper pairs can occupy the same space. Electrons have spin-, so they are fermions, but the total spin of a Cooper pair is integer (0 or 1) so it is a composite boson. This means the wave functions are symmetric under particle interchange. Therefore, unlike electrons, multiple Cooper pairs are allowed to be in the same quantum state, which is responsible for the phenomenon of superconductivity.

The BCS theory is also applicable to other fermion systems, such as helium-3. Indeed, Cooper pairing is responsible for the superfluidity of helium-3 at low temperatures. In 2008 it was proposed that pairs of bosons in an optical lattice may be similar to Cooper pairs.

== Relationship to superconductivity ==
The tendency for all the Cooper pairs in a body to &quot;condense&quot; into the same ground quantum state is responsible for the peculiar properties of superconductivity.

Cooper originally considered only the case of an isolated pair&#x27;s formation in a metal. When one considers the more realistic state of many electronic pair formations, as is elucidated in the full BCS theory, one finds that the pairing opens a gap in the continuous spectrum of allowed energy states of the electrons, meaning that all excitations of the system must possess some minimum amount of energy. This &quot;gap to excitations&quot; leads to superconductivity, since small excitations such as scattering of electrons are forbidden.
The gap appears due to many-body effects between electrons feeling the attraction.

R. A. Ogg Jr., was first to suggest that electrons might act as pairs coupled by lattice vibrations in the material. This was indicated by the isotope effect observed in superconductors. The isotope effect showed that materials with heavier ions (different nuclear isotopes) had lower superconducting transition temperatures. This can be explained by the theory of Cooper pairing: heavier ions are harder for the electrons to attract and move (how Cooper pairs are formed), which results in smaller binding energy for the pairs.

The theory of Cooper pairs is quite general and does not depend on the specific electron-phonon interaction. Condensed matter theorists have proposed pairing mechanisms based on other attractive interactions such as electron–exciton interactions or electron–plasmon interactions. Currently, none of these other pairing interactions has been observed in any material.

It should be mentioned that Cooper pairing does not involve individual electrons pairing up to form &quot;quasi-bosons&quot;. The paired states are energetically favored, and electrons go in and out of those states preferentially. This is a fine distinction that John Bardeen makes:

:&quot;&quot;The idea of paired electrons, though not fully accurate, captures the sense of it.&quot;&quot;

The mathematical description of the second-order coherence involved here is given by Yang.

<text>Pioneer 5 (also known as Pioneer P-2, and Able 4, and nicknamed the &quot;Paddle-Wheel Satellite&quot;) was a spin-stabilized space probe in the NASA Pioneer program used to investigate interplanetary space between the orbits of Earth and Venus. It was launched on 11 March 1960 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 17A at 13:00:00 UTC with an on-orbit dry mass of . It was a diameter sphere with span across its four solar panels and achieved a solar orbit of 0.806 × 0.995 AU (121,000,000 by 149,000,000 km).

Data was received until 30 April 1960. Among other accomplishments, the probe confirmed the existence of interplanetary magnetic fields. &quot;Pioneer 5&quot; was the most successful probe in the Pioneer/Able series.

The original mission plan was for a launch in November 1959 where &quot;Pioneer 5&quot; would conduct a flyby of Venus, but technical issues prevented the launch from occurring until early 1960 by which time the Venus window for the year had closed. Since it was not possible to send the probe to Venus, it would instead merely investigate interplanetary space and an actual mission to the planet would have to wait another three years.

== Design and instruments ==
The spacecraft was a diameter sphere with four solar panels that spanned over and it was equipped with four scientific instruments:
# A triple coincidence omnidirectional proportional counter telescope to detect solar particles and observe terrestrial trapped radiation. It could detect photons with E &gt; 75 MeV and electrons with E &gt; 13 MeV.
# A rotating search coil magnetometer to measure the magnetic field in the distant field of the Earth, near the geomagnetic boundary, and in interplanetary space. It was capable of measuring fields from 1 microgauss to 12 milligauss. It consisted of a single search coil that was mounted on the spacecraft in such a way that it measured the magnetic field perpendicular to the spin axis of the spacecraft. It could output its measurements in both an analog and a digital format.
# A Neher-type integrating ionization chamber and an Anton 302 Geiger-Müller tube (which functioned as a cosmic ray detector) to measure cosmic radiation. It was mounted normal to the spin axis of the spacecraft.
# A micrometeorite momentum spectrometer (or micrometeorite detector) that consisted of two diaphragm and microphone combinations. It was used to measure the amount of meteoritic dust particles and the momentum of these particles.

== Mission ==
Booster performance during launch was overall excellent considering the numerous earlier difficulties with the Thor-Able vehicle. There were some minor anomalies with the second stage flight control system that resulted in unplanned pitch and roll motions, however, they were not enough to endanger the mission.

The spacecraft returned data collected by the magnetometer on the magnetic field and it measured that the median undisturbed interplanetary field was approximately 5 γ ± 0.5 γ in magnitude.
The spacecraft also measured solar flare particles, and cosmic radiation in the interplanetary region. The micrometeorite counter failed to operate as the data system saturated and failed to operate properly.

The recorded digital data were transmitted at 1, 8, and 64 bit/s, depending on the distance of the spacecraft from Earth and the size of the receiving antenna. Weight limitations on the solar cells prevented continuous operation of the telemetry transmitters. About four operations of 25 min duration were scheduled per day with occasional increases during times of special interest. A total of 138.9 h of operation was completed, and over three megabits of data were received. The major portion of the data was received by the Lovell radio telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory and the Hawaii Tracking Station because their antennas provided grid reception. Data was received until 30 April 1960, after which telemetry noise and weak signal strength made data reception impossible. The spacecraft&#x27;s signal was detected by Jodrell Bank from a record distance of 36.2 million km (22.5 million miles) on 26 June 1960, although it was much too weak by then to acquire data.

== Communications ==

In common with Explorer 6, Pioneer 5 used the earliest known digital telemetry system used on spacecraft, codenamed &quot;Telebit&quot;, which was a tenfold (or 10 dB) improvement in channel efficiency on previous generation &quot;Microlock&quot; analog systems in use since Explorer 1 and the biggest single improvement in signal encoding on western spacecraft. The spacecraft received the uplink carrier at 401.8 MHz and converted it to a 378.2 MHz signal using a 16/17 coherent oscillator circuit. The telemetry system phase modulated a 512 Hz subcarrier, which was in turn amplitude modulated at 64, 8, or 1bit/s. The spacecraft was unable to aim its antennas, and so had no high-gain dish antenna common on later spacecraft. Instead, the system could introduce a 150W amplifier into its normally 5W transmitter circuit. It was powered by a battery of 28 F-size NiCd cells recharged by the solar paddles, allowing up to eight minutes of high power communications before risking damage to the batteries. Each hour of 5W communications or five minutes of 150W communications required ten hours of recharging the batteries. Unlike later interplanetary spacecraft (Mariner 2 and beyond), this spacecraft did not use the Deep Space Network, which was not yet available, but a somewhat ad hoc Space Network called SPAN consisting of the 76m Lovell Telescope (then called Manchester Mark I), a 26-meter radio telescope in Hawaii, and a small helical array in Singapore.

<doc id="376853" wikidata="Q6867297" url="?curid=376853" title="Ministry of International Trade and Industry">
<text>The was a ministry of the Government of Japan from 1949 to 2001. The MITI was one of the most powerful government agencies in Japan and, at the height of its influence, effectively ran much of Japanese industrial policy, funding research and directing investment. In 2001, MITI was merged with other agencies during the Central Government Reform to form the newly created Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).

==History==
MITI was created with the split of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in May 1949 and given the mission for coordinating international trade policy with other groups, such as the Bank of Japan, the Economic Planning Agency, and the various commerce-related cabinet ministries. At the time it was created, Japan was still recovering from the economic disaster of World War II. With inflation rising and productivity failing to keep up, the government sought a better mechanism for reviving the Japanese economy.

MITI has been responsible not only in the areas of exports and imports but also for all domestic industries and businesses not specifically covered by other ministries in the areas of investment in plant and equipment, pollution control, energy and power, some aspects of foreign economic assistance, and consumer complaints. This span has allowed MITI to integrate conflicting policies, such as those on pollution control and export competitiveness, to minimize damage to export industries.

MITI has served as an architect of industrial policy, an arbiter on industrial problems and disputes, and a regulator. A major objective of the ministry has been to strengthen the country&#x27;s industrial base. It has not managed Japanese trade and industry along the lines of a centrally planned economy, but it has provided industries with administrative guidance and other direction, both formal and informal, on modernization, technology, investments in new plants and equipment, and domestic and foreign competition.

The close relationship between MITI and Japanese industry has led to foreign trade policy that often complements the ministry&#x27;s efforts to strengthen domestic manufacturing interests. MITI facilitated the early development of nearly all major industries by providing protection from import competition, technological intelligence, help in licensing foreign technology, access to foreign exchange, and assistance in mergers.

These policies to promote domestic industry and to protect it from international competition were strongest in the 1950s and 1960s. As industry became stronger and as MITI lost some of its policy tools, such as control over allocation of foreign exchange, MITI&#x27;s policies also changed. The success of Japanese exports and the tension it has caused in other countries led MITI to provide guidance on limiting exports of particular products to various countries. Starting in 1981, MITI presided over the establishment of voluntary restraints on automobile exports to the United States to allay criticism from American manufacturers and their unions.

Similarly, MITI was forced to liberalize import policies, despite its traditional protectionist focus. During the 1980s, the ministry helped to craft a number of market-opening and import promoting measures, including the creation of an import promotion office within the ministry. The close relationship between MITI and industry allowed the ministry to play such a role in fostering more open markets, but conflict remained between the need to open markets and the desire to continue promoting new and growing domestic industries.

As late as the 1980s, prime ministers were expected to serve a tenure as MITI minister before taking over the government. MITI worked closely with Japanese business interests, and was largely responsible for keeping the domestic market closed to most foreign companies.

MITI lost some influence when the switch was made to a floating exchange rate between the United States dollar and yen in 1971. Before that point, MITI had been able to keep the exchange rate artificially low, which benefited Japan&#x27;s exporters. Later, intense lobbying from other countries, particularly the United States, pushed Japan to introduce more liberal trade laws that further lessened MITI&#x27;s grip over the Japanese economy. By the mid-1980s, the ministry was helping foreign corporations set up operations in Japan.

The decline of MITI was described by Johnstone:
:... by the early 1980s, when Western analysts first became aware of MITI, the ministry&#x27;s glory days were over. In 1979 MITI lost its primary instrument of control over Japanese firms – allocation of foreign currency. The power, that is, to decide who could – and who could not – import technologies. [For example] ... MITI bureaucrats attempted to deny fledgling Sony the $25,000 the company needed to license transistor technology from Western Electric.

However MITI still continued to benefit industry, especially in semiconductors, where, to overcome resistance to a new technology, it forced every electronic company to have at least one CMOS project going.

The influence of MITI shrank in the 1990s because of deregulation and the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, and the creation of the World Trade Organization made it more difficult for governments to protect local companies from foreign competition. The declining significance of MITI to Japanese companies made it a less powerful agency within the bureaucracy, and by the end of the 20th century, it was folded into a larger body. In 2001, it was reorganized into the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI).

<doc id="376854" wikidata="Q335408" url="?curid=376854" title="Pioneer 6, 7, 8, and 9">
<text>Pioneer 6, 7, 8, and 9 were space probes in the Pioneer program, launched between 1965 and 1969. They were a series of solar-orbiting, spin-stabilized, solar cell- and battery-powered satellites designed to obtain measurements on a continuing basis of interplanetary phenomena from widely separated points in space. They were also known as Pioneer A, B, C, and D. The fifth (Pioneer E) was lost in a launch accident, and therefore did not receive a numerical designation.

== Purpose ==
&quot;Pioneers 6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, and &quot;9&quot; were created to make the first detailed, comprehensive measurements of the solar wind, solar magnetic field and cosmic rays. They were designed to measure large scale magnetic phenomena and particles and fields in interplanetary space. Data from the vehicles have been used to better understand stellar processes and the structure and flow of the solar wind. The vehicles also acted as the world&#x27;s first space-based solar weather network, providing practical data on solar storms which affect communications and power on Earth.

The experiments studied the positive ions (cations) and electrons in the solar wind, the interplanetary electron density (radio propagation experiment), solar and galactic cosmic rays, and the Interplanetary Magnetic Field.

The spacecraft were important collectors of heliophysics and space weather data. In conjunction with other spacecraft these, for the first time, enabled spaceborne observations to be combined with terrestrial observations on the ground and from sounding balloons. In early August 1972 Pioneer 9 recorded significant observations of one of the most potent solar storms ever recorded, and the most hazardous to human spaceflight during the Space Age.

==Vehicle description==

Each craft was identical. They were spin-stabilized diameter × tall cylinders with a long magnetometer boom and solar panels mounted around the body.

The main antenna was a high-gain directional antenna. The spacecraft were spin-stabilized at about 60 RPM, and the spin axis was perpendicular to the ecliptic plane and pointed toward the south ecliptic pole.

Instruments differed somewhat between spacecraft, with some being used in all four missions:
== Communications ==
By ground command, one of five bit rates, one of four data formats, and one of four operating modes could be selected. The five-bit rates were 512, 256, 64, 16, and 8 bit/s. Three of the four data formats contained primarily scientific data and consisted of 32 seven-bit words per frame. One scientific data format was for use at the two highest bit rates. Another was for use at the three lowest bit rates. The third contained data from only the radio propagation experiment. The fourth data format contained mainly engineering data.

The four operating modes were: real-time, telemetry store, duty cycle store, and memory readout. In the real-time mode, data were sampled and transmitted directly (without storage) as specified by the data format and bit rate selected. In the telemetry store mode, data were stored and transmitted simultaneously in the format and at the bit rate selected. In the duty-cycle store mode, a single frame of scientific data was collected and stored at a rate of 512 bit/s. The time interval between the collection and storage of successive frames could be varied by ground command between 2 and 17 min to provide partial data coverage for periods up to 19 hours, as limited by the bit storage capacity. In the memory readout mode, data was read out at whatever bit rate was appropriate to the satellite distance from Earth.

==Timeline and current status==
As stated by JPL, &quot;The Pioneer 6–9 program has been touted as one of the least expensive of all NASA spacecraft programs in terms of scientific results per dollar spent.&quot; Although the four spacecraft have not been regularly tracked for science data return in recent years, a successful telemetry contact with Pioneer 6 was made on December 8, 2000, to celebrate 35 years of continuous operation since launch. Its original design life expectancy was only 6 months.

Although NASA described &quot;Pioneer 6&quot; as &quot;extant&quot; , there has been no contact since December 8, 2000. At this time &quot;Pioneer 6&quot; had operated for 12,758 days, making it the oldest operating space probe until it was surpassed by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on August 13, 2012. It is also believed that contact is still possible with &quot;Pioneer 7&quot; and &quot;8&quot;; only &quot;Pioneer 9&quot; is definitely not working.

<doc id="376856" wikidata="Q1366089" url="?curid=376856" title="Battle of Fort Henry">
<text>The Battle of Fort Henry was fought on February 6, 1862, in Stewart County, Tennessee, during the American Civil War. It was the first important victory for the Union and Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in the Western Theater.

On February 4 and 5, Grant landed two divisions just north of Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. (The troops serving under Grant were the nucleus of the Union&#x27;s successful Army of the Tennessee, although that name was not yet in use.) Grant&#x27;s plan was to advance upon the fort on February 6 while it was being simultaneously attacked by Union gunboats commanded by Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote. A combination of accurate and effective naval gunfire, heavy rain, and the poor siting of the fort, nearly inundated by rising river waters, caused its commander, Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, to surrender to Foote before the Union Army arrived.

The surrender of Fort Henry opened the Tennessee River to Union traffic upriver through and along West Tennessee to a point south of the Alabama border. In the days following the fort&#x27;s surrender, from February 6 through February 12, Union raids used ironclad boats to destroy Confederate shipping and railroad bridges along the river. On February 12, Grant&#x27;s army proceeded overland to engage with Confederate troops in the Battle of Fort Donelson.

==Background==
In early 1861 the critical border state of Kentucky had declared neutrality in the American Civil War. This neutrality was first violated on September 3, when Confederate Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, acting on orders from Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, occupied Columbus, Kentucky, which overlooked strong defensive bluffs, to defend the Mississippi from Federal offensive action and was the terminus of the Memphis &amp; Ohio railroad, which in turn leads southwards to the extremely important Charleston &amp; Memphis railroad. The riverside town was situated on high bluffs that commanded the river at that point, where the Confederates installed 140 large guns, underwater mines and a heavy chain that stretched a mile across the Mississippi River to Belmont, while occupying the town with 17,000 Confederate troops, thus cutting off northern commerce to the south and beyond.

Two days later, Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, displaying the personal initiative that would characterize his later career, seized Paducah, Kentucky, a major transportation hub of rail and port facilities at the mouth of the Tennessee River. Henceforth, neither adversary respected Kentucky&#x27;s proclaimed neutrality, and the Confederate advantage was lost. The buffer zone that Kentucky provided between the North and the South was no longer available to assist in the defense of Tennessee. 

By early 1862, a single general, Albert Sidney Johnston, commanded all the Confederate forces from Arkansas to the Cumberland Gap, but his forces were spread too thinly over a wide defensive line. Johnston&#x27;s left flank was Polk, in Columbus with 12,000 men; his right flank was Brig. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 4,000 men; the center consisted of two forts, Forts Henry and Donelson, under the command of Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, also with 4,000 men. Forts Henry and Donelson were the sole positions defending the important Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, respectively. If these rivers were opened to Union military traffic, two direct invasion paths would lead into western &amp; eastern Tennessee, and the vital Memphis &amp; SC Railroad and more.
The Union military command in the West suffered from a lack of unified command, and were organized into three separate departments: the Department of Kansas, under Maj. Gen. David Hunter; the Department of Missouri, under Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck; and the Department of the Ohio, under Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell. By January 1862, the disunity was apparent because they could not agree on a strategy for operations in the Western Theater. Buell, under political pressure to invade and hold pro-Union eastern Tennessee, moved slowly in the direction of Nashville. In Halleck&#x27;s department, Grant moved up the Tennessee River to divert attention from Buell&#x27;s intended advance, which did not occur. Halleck and the other generals in the West were coming under political pressure from President Abraham Lincoln to participate in a general offensive by Washington&#x27;s birthday (February 22). Despite his tradition of caution, Halleck eventually reacted positively to Grant&#x27;s proposal to move against Fort Henry. Halleck hoped that this would improve his standing in relation to his rival, Buell. Halleck and Grant were also concerned about rumors that Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard would soon arrive with 15 Confederate regiments. On January 30, 1862, Halleck authorized Grant to take Fort Henry.

Grant wasted no time, leaving Cairo, Illinois, at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, on February 2. His invasion force, which arrived on the Tennessee River on February 4 and 5, consisted of 15,000–17,000 men in two divisions, commanded by Brig. Gens. John A. McClernand and Charles F. Smith, supported by the Western Gunboat Flotilla, commanded by United States Navy Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote. The flotilla included four ironclad gunboats (flagship , USS &quot;Carondelet&quot;, USS &quot;St. Louis&quot;, and USS &quot;Essex&quot;) under Foote&#x27;s direct command, and three timberclad gunboats (USS &quot;Conestoga&quot;, USS &quot;Tyler&quot;, and USS &quot;Lexington&quot;) under Lt. Seth Ledyard Phelps. Insufficient transport ships this early in the war to deliver all of the army troops in a single operation required two trips upriver to reach the fort. General Johnston was pressured by the confederate government to defend the Cumberland &amp; Tennessee and the important railroads in the region, to which end he converged all his forces further south, facing Buell&#x27;s forces at the Cumberland Gap passes. His subordinate Beauregard incessantly protested at his defensive strategy, urging him to advance and meet the unionist offensive, or at least reinforce the fortifications on the rivers. Johnston refused, leaving a substantial force to guard Fort Donelson. Fort Henry was considered a liability due to its poor position &amp; engineering which made it highly susceptible to being flooded during high tide and rain, and was garrisoned by a token force of 3,000-4,000 including the crews for the heavy guns, which was considered adequate for defending against enemy naval attack, in the meantime a new fort was being constructed on better ground upriver.

==Fort Henry==
Fort Henry was a five-sided, open-bastioned earthen structure covering on the eastern bank of the Tennessee River, near Kirkman&#x27;s Old Landing. The site was about one mile above Panther Creek and about six miles below the mouth of the Big Sandy River and Standing Rock Creek.
In May 1861, Isham G. Harris, the governor of Tennessee, appointed the state&#x27;s attorney, Daniel S. Donelson, as a brigadier general and directed him to build fortifications on the rivers of Middle Tennessee. Donelson found suitable sites, but they were within the borders of Kentucky, still a neutral state at that time. Moving upriver, just inside the Tennessee border, Donelson selected the site of the fort on the Cumberland River that would bear his name. Colonel Bushrod Johnson of the Tennessee Corps of Engineers approved of the site.

As construction of Fort Donelson began, Donelson moved west, to the Tennessee River, and selected the site of Fort Henry, naming it after Tennessee Senator Gustavus Adolphus Henry Sr. With Fort Donelson on the west bank of the Cumberland, Donelson selected the east bank of the Tennessee for the second fort so one garrison could travel between them and defend both positions. (Donelson thought it unlikely that the two forts would be attacked simultaneously.) Unlike its counterpart on the Cumberland, Fort Henry was situated on low, swampy ground and dominated by hills across the river. This oversight developed into frequent flooding of the fort during rains or high tide, on some occasions more than half of the fort was underwater after rain, including most of its armory. To its advantage, it had an unobstructed field of fire downriver. Donelson&#x27;s surveying team—Adna Anderson, a civil engineer, and Maj. William F. Foster from the 1st Tennessee Infantry—objected strongly to the site and appealed to Colonel Johnson, who inexplicably approved it.
The fort was designed to stop traffic on the river, not to withstand large-scale infantry assaults that armies would use during the war. Construction began in mid-June, using men from the 10th Tennessee Infantry and slaves. The first cannon was test fired on July 12, 1861. After this flurry of activity, the remainder of 1861 saw little action because forts on the Mississippi River had a higher priority for receiving men and artillery. General Polk also neglected Forts Henry and Donelson in favor of defending Columbus, Kentucky. In late December, additional men from the 27th Alabama Infantry arrived along with 500 slaves to construct a small fortification across the river on Stewart&#x27;s Hill, within artillery range of Fort Henry, and named it Fort Heiman. In January 1862, Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman assumed command of both Forts Henry and Donelson, with a combined force of 4,900 men. At Fort Henry, approximately 3,000–3,400 men in two brigades were commanded by Colonels Adolphus Heiman and Joseph Drake. The men were armed primarily with antique flintlock rifles from the War of 1812.

Seventeen guns were mounted in Fort Henry by the time of the battle, eleven covering the river and the other six positioned to defend against a land attack (18-pounder smoothbores). There were two heavy guns, a Columbiad and a 24-pounder rifled cannon, with the remainder being 32-pounder smoothbores. There were also two 42-pounders, but no ammunition of that caliber was available. When the river was at normal levels, the fort&#x27;s walls rose above it and were thick at the base, sloping upward to a width of nearly at the parapet. However, in February 1862, heavy rains caused the river to rise and most of the fort was underwater, including the powder magazine.

The Confederates deployed one additional defensive measure, which was then unique in the history of warfare: several torpedoes (in modern terminology, a naval minefield) were anchored below the surface in the main shipping channel, rigged to explode when touched by a passing ship. (This measure turned out to be ineffective, due to high water levels and leaks in the torpedoes&#x27; metal containers.)

==Battle==
On February 4 and 5, Grant landed his divisions in two different locations. McClernand&#x27;s division was north of the fort, on the east bank of the Tennessee River, to prevent the garrison&#x27;s escape. C.F. Smith&#x27;s division would seize Fort Heiman on the Kentucky side of the river and turn its artillery on Fort Henry. When heavy rains the night of February 5 slowed the progress of Union troops toward the forts, the battle turned on naval actions, which concluded before the infantry saw action.

Tilghman realized that it was only a matter of time before Fort Henry fell. Only nine guns remained above the water to mount a defense. While leaving artillery in the fort to hold off the Union gunboats, he ordered the majority of his force to march, under the command of Col. Adolphus Heiman, on the overland route to Fort Donelson, 12 miles (19 km) away. Fort Heiman was abandoned on February 4; gunfire from the gunboats on Fort Henry garrison caused 4 Confederate casualties [1 killed 3 wounded] on the afternoon of February 5. All but a part of Company B,1st Tennessee Artillery CSA [54 men] left Fort Henry on February 5. (Union cavalry pursued the retreating Confederates, but poor road conditions prevented any serious confrontation and they took few captives.) Tilghman, as was his custom, spent the night of February 5–6 on the steamer &quot;Dunbar&quot;, upstream from the fort. Around midnight he sent an update on the situation to Johnston, then returned to Fort Henry just before dawn.
On the morning of February 6, Foote&#x27;s seven Union gunboats arrived at Fort Henry and established their position around 12:30 p.m. They soon opened fire from a distance at 1,700 yards (around 1,554 meters), beginning an exchange of gunfire with Fort Henry that continued for over an hour. After Tilghman rejected an initial call to surrender, the fleet continued to bombard the fort. This was its first engagement using newly designed and hastily constructed ironclads. Foote deployed the four ironclad gunboats in a line abreast, followed by the three timberclads, under the command of Seth Ledyard Phelps, which were held back for long-range, but less effective fire against the fort. The high water level of the river and the low elevation of Fort Henry&#x27;s guns allowed Foote&#x27;s fleet to escape serious destruction. The Confederate fire was able to hit the ironclads only where their armor was strongest. During the bombardment, all four of the Union ironclads were repeatedly hit by Confederate fire. The USS &quot;Essex&quot; was seriously damaged when a 32-pound shot from Fort Henry penetrated the ironclad, hitting the middle boiler and sending scalding steam through half the ship. Thirty-two crewmen were killed or wounded, including commander William D. Porter. The ship was out of action for the remainder of the campaign.

==Aftermath and the timberclad raid==
After the bombardment had lasted 75 minutes, Tilghman surrendered to Foote&#x27;s fleet, which had closed to within for a close-range bombardment. Before the battle, Tilghman told his men that he would offer an hour of resistance to allow his men additional time to escape. With only one cannon still working, down to the last few rounds due to the powder magazine being underwater, and the rest of the guns destroyed or knocked out, Tilghman ordered the Confederate flag at Fort Henry lowered and a white sheet raised on the fort&#x27;s flagpole. Upon seeing the white flag, the Union gunboats immediately ceased fire. The flooded state of the fort was as such that the surrendering party sailed out of the sally port of the fort in a small launch and picked up Tilghman for the surrender negotiation on &quot;Cincinnati&quot;. Twelve officers and 82 men of the garrison surrendered; other casualties from the fort&#x27;s garrison were estimated to be 15 men killed and 20 wounded. The evacuating Confederate force left all of its artillery and equipment behind. Tilghman was imprisoned for many months, and exchanged in August 15.

Tilghman wrote bitterly in his report that Fort Henry was in a &quot;wretched military position. ... The history of military engineering records no parallel to this case.&quot; Grant sent a brief dispatch to Halleck: &quot;Fort Henry is ours. ... I shall take and destroy Fort Donelson on the 8th and return to Fort Henry.&quot; Halleck wired Washington, D.C.: &quot;Fort Henry is ours. The flag is reestablished on the soil of Tennessee. It will never be removed.&quot;

Grant and his troops arrived at Fort Henry at around 3 p.m. on February 6 to see that the garrison had already surrendered. McClernand&#x27;s division arrived at the fort about 30 minutes later. In the meantime, Smith&#x27;s division had reached the deserted Fort Heiman. If Grant had been cautious and delayed his departure by two days, the battle would have never occurred. By February 8, Fort Henry was completely underwater. On February 7, the Union gunboats &quot;Cincinnati&quot;, &quot;St. Louis&quot;, and &quot;Essex&quot; returned to Cairo with whistles blowing and flying Fort Henry&#x27;s captured Confederate flags upside down. The Chicago &quot;Tribune&quot; proclaimed the battle as &quot;one of the most complete and signal victories in the annals of the world&#x27;s warfare.&quot;
Fort Henry&#x27;s fall quickly opened the Tennessee River to Union gunboats and shipping south of the Alabama border. Immediately after the surrender, Foote sent Lieutenant Phelps with the three timberclads, &quot;Tyler&quot;, &quot;Conestoga&quot;, and &quot;Lexington&quot;, on a mission upriver to destroy installations and supplies of military value. (The flotilla&#x27;s ironclads had sustained damage in the bombardment of Fort Henry and were slower and less maneuverable for the mission at hand, which included pursuit of Confederate ships.) The raid reached as far as Muscle Shoals, just past Florence, Alabama, the river&#x27;s navigable limit. The Union timberclads and their raiding parties destroyed supplies and an important bridge of the Memphis and Ohio Railroad, upriver. They also captured a variety of southern ships, including &quot;Sallie Wood&quot;, &quot;Muscle&quot;, and &quot;Eastport&quot;, an ironclad under construction. The citizens of Florence asked Phelps to spare their town and its railroad bridge. Phelps agreed, seeing no military importance to the bridge. One 19th century source described Phelps’ raid as “a perfect success. It discovered the real weakness of the Confederacy in that direction, the feasibility of marching an army into the heart of the Confederacy, and, better than all, it developed the most gratifying evidences of genuine Union feeling in Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama.” According to the same account, Phelps recruited several pro-Union Southerners to assist him during the raid. The Union gunboats returned safely to Fort Henry on February 12.

After the fall of Fort Donelson to Grant&#x27;s army on February 16, the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, two major water routes in the Confederate west, became Union waterways for movement of troops and material. As Grant suspected, the Union capture of the two forts and the rivers flanked the Confederate forces at Columbus, and soon caused them to withdraw from that city and from western Kentucky.

==Preservation==
Although closely associated with Fort Donelson, the Fort Henry site is not managed by the U.S. National Park Service as part of the Fort Donelson National Battlefield. It is currently part of the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. When the Tennessee River was dammed in the 1930s, creating Kentucky Lake, the remains of Fort Henry were permanently submerged. A small navigation beacon, far from the Kentucky shoreline, marks the location of the northwest corner of the former fort. Fort Heiman was on privately owned land until October 2006, when the Calloway County, Kentucky, executive office transferred associated with that fort to the National Park Service for management as part of the Fort Donelson National Battlefield. Some of the entrenchments are still visible.

<text>The House of Asen, also Asen dynasty or the Asenids (, romanized: &quot;Asenevtsi&quot;), founded and ruled a medieval Bulgarian state, called in modern historiography the Second Bulgarian Empire, between 1185 and 1280.

The Asen dynasty rose as the leaders of Bulgaria after a rebellion against the Byzantine Empire at the turn of the year 1185/1186 caused by the increase in the Imperial taxes.

Some members of the Asen family entered Byzantine service in the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries. The name also occurs as a family name in modern Greek, and could go back to the same name. Their origin is obscure.

==Origins==
The origins of the dynasty, especially the ethnic background of the three Asen brothers (Teodor I Peter IV (), Ivan Asen I () and Kaloyan ()) are still a source of much controversy, debated among historians. There are three main hypotheses regarding their origins:
# Vlach origin, a view supported by most contemporary sources and scholars who base their claims on Western Crusade chronicles, and letters between Pope Innocent III and Kaloyan.
# Cuman origin, as some of the names in the dynasty, including Asen and Belgun, are derived from Cuman language, as well as the close ties to the Cumans, such as intermarriage (including Kaloyan&#x27;s wife), immediate entourage and allies. Groups of Cumans settled and mingled with the local population in many regions of the Balkans between the 10th and 13th centuries and founded also other successive Bulgarian dynasties (Terterids and Shishmanids). 
# Bulgarian origin, a view that is common among the Bulgarian historians who reckon that all native sources (from the 13th century) use predominantly the terms Bulgaria, Bulgarians and Bulgarian, the Slavic names like Ivanko (relative and murderer of Ivan Asen I), Boril and Slav, that tsar Kaloyan claimed provenance from the old Bulgarian rulers and his state from the First Bulgarian Empire and declares himself a Bulgarian avenger, adopting the moniker the Romanslayer by analogy with the emperor Basil II the Bulgar Slayer and shows cruelty to the Byzantines as revenge for the murdered and blinded Bulgarians.

In their own administrative documents and correspondence, the three rulers viewed themselves as descendants and successors of the Bulgarian Tsars Samuil, Peter I and Simeon I, and the state they founded as a continuation of the First Bulgarian Empire. However, this could be just a way to proclaim their legitimacy for the throne of the Empire.

In a correspondence, of 1199, the Pope talks about the &quot;Roman descent&quot; of Kaloyan. However, considering the actual text says &quot;Nos autem audito quod de nobili urbis Romae prosapia progenitores tui originem traxerint&quot; (&quot;We heard that your forefathers come from a noble family from the city of Rome&quot;), it is usually dismissed as simply a hidden compliment of the Pope to Kaloyan.

Pope Innocent III in his letter to the Bulgarian King Kaloyan (Calojoannes) in 1204 addressed him &quot;King of Bulgarians and Vlachs&quot; (&quot;rex Bulgarorum et Blachorum&quot;); in answering the Pope, John called himself &quot;imperator omnium Bulgarorum et Blachorum&quot; (&quot;Emperor of all Bulgarians and Vlachs&#x27;), but signed himself &quot;imperator Bulgariae Calojoannes&quot; (&quot;Emperor Kaloyan of Bulgaria&quot;); besides, the archbishop of Veliko Tarnovo called himself &quot;totius Bulgariae et Blaciae Primas&quot; (&quot;Primate of all Bulgaria and Vlachia&quot;).

Ivan Asen II styles himselve “Tsar and sovereign of the Bulgarians“ and “Tsar of Bulgarians and Greeks”.

The Bulgarian historiography negate, while the Romanian highlight the role of the Vlachs in the uprising. However, the scientific debate reflects the nationalistic rivality from the 19-20th century, which did not exist in the 12-13th century. Vlachs and Bulgarian Slavs jointly inhabited Bulgaria, and both groups in sufferance were united against the common cause under a leader, regardless of the leader &quot;race&quot;. The Asen brothers were associated with the Vlach population of the mountainous regions around Trnovo, Niketas Choniates recorded Vlach shamans during revolt exhibition, but nevertheless of their ethnicity, it was a joint venture of the Bulgarians, Vlachs and Cumans.

=== Etymology ===
The name of the dynasty comes from one of the brothers, namely Asen I. The etymology is most likely of Cuman Turkic origin, derived from &quot;esen&quot; which meant &quot;safe, sound, healthy&quot; and the Belgun nickname seems to be derived from Turkic &quot;bilgün&quot;, which meant &quot;wise&quot;. Further support to this connection can be found in the charters of the Great Lavra of Mt. Athos from the end of the 12th century, which mention the monastery&#x27;s problems with some of the Cuman stratiotes, where &quot;Asen&quot; is listed as the name of one of those Cumans.

Other study shows that the only name that makes sense is &quot;änish&quot; (&quot;descent&quot;) and the word can be found almost exclusively in the languages of the Kipchak Turks

==Byzantine branch==
The Asens in Byzantium largely descend from Ivan Asen III, who ruled briefly as Emperor of Bulgaria before fleeing to Constantinople as Ivaylo&#x27;s uprising was gaining momentum in 1280. A &quot;despotes&quot; under Michael VIII Palaiologos, Ivan Asen III had already been married to the Byzantine Emperor&#x27;s eldest daughter, Irene Palaiologina. The couple&#x27;s five sons and two daughters were the progenitors of one of the highest-regarded Byzantine noble families of their time, along with the Palaiologoi. Among the Byzantine Asens, three bore the title of &quot;despotes&quot;, three that of &quot;sebastokrator&quot;, two &quot;panhypersebastos&quot;, one was a &quot;megas doux&quot; and two were titled &quot;megas primikerios&quot;. In Greek, the male form of the family name is rendered as Ἀσάνης (&quot;Asanis&quot;) and the female as Ασανίνα (&quot;Asanina&quot;).

A smaller branch descends from Elena Asenina of Bulgaria, wife of Nicaean Emperor Theodore II Laskaris.

The Asens of Byzantium intermarried with other prominent noble dynasties, including the Kantakouzenos, Doukas, Laskaris, Tornikios, Raoul and Zaccaria families. Notable members of the Asen family in the Byzantine Empire include:

* Andronikos Asen, &quot;epitropos&quot; of the Morea (1316–1322)
* Irene Asanina, Empress Consort of John VI Kantakouzenos (1347–1354)
* Matthew Asen Kantakouzenos, Co-Emperor of Byzantium (1353–1357)
* Matthew Palaiologos Asen, Lord of Corinth (1454–1458)

===Byzantine Asens elsewhere===
From Byzantium, the Asens spread as far as Frankish Greece, the Principality of Theodoro, the Principality of Moldavia, the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Aragon.

* Eudoxia Laskarina Asanina (1248–1311), Nicaean princess, Countess of Ventimiglia and Tende and nun in Aragon 
* Helena Asanina Kantakouzene, Dowager Countess of Salona (1380–1394)
* Andronikos Asen Zaccaria, Prince of Achaea (before 1386-1401)
* Thomas Asen Palaiologos, exile in Naples and &quot;ktetor&quot;
* Maria Asanina Palaiologina, Princess Consort of Moldavia (1472–1477)

<text>Bay rum is a type of cologne and aftershave lotion.
Other uses include as under-arm deodorant and as a fragrance for shaving soap, as well as a general astringent.
==Origins==
It is a distillate that was originally made in Saint Thomas &quot;and probably other West Indian islands&quot; from rum and the leaves and/or berries of the West Indian bay tree, &quot;Pimenta racemosa&quot;.

John Maisch identified the leaf in the herbarium at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, collected in Saint Croix, &quot;by the late Dr. Griffith&quot;, which was identified as &quot;Myrcia acris&quot;, now transferred to the genus &quot;Pimenta&quot;. Maisch added that it was &quot;very probable that various species are made use of for the same purpose.&quot; According to an 1889 reference, other ingredients may be citrus and spice oils, the most common being lime oil and oil of cloves. A drop of oil of cloves is added to two parts bay oil and one part pimento oil in one of two recipes for bay rum; the aromatics are steeped in alcohol and as a last step an equal part of &quot;good rum&quot; is added, and cinnamon.

==Popularity==
It was first made fashionable in New York and other American cities before it was available in Europe. 

This Rexall bay rum example (&quot;pictured&quot;) from the Prohibition era in the United States was labeled &quot;for external use only&quot;, but with 58% grain alcohol it was often used as a legal, if somewhat toxic, source of beverage alcohol. A 1933 recording by Clarence &quot;Tom&quot; Ashley and Gwen Foster, &quot;Bay Rum Blues&quot;, references drinking bay rum purchased from the Raylass chain department store in Gastonia, North Carolina.

==Products==
Proprietary bay rum lotions are produced by labs in several West Indian countries, as well as American and European fragrance companies. The original bay rum from St. Thomas by A. H. Riise continues to be produced locally in the US Virgin Islands by the West Indies Bay Company.

The bay laurel, the &quot;bay leaves&quot; in common culinary use, are from a completely unrelated species, &quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;, and not the West Indian bay tree. Bay laurel can be used to produce a similar, although not identical, product.

<text>Joseph Gillott (11 October 1799 – 5 January 1872) was an English pen-manufacturer and patron of the arts based in Birmingham.

== Pen manufacturing ==

After a brief period of schooling, Gillott began working in the cutlery trade in his home town of Sheffield. In 1821 he moved to Birmingham, where he found employment in the steel toy trade, the technical name for the manufacture of steel buckles, chains and light ornamental steel-work generally.

About 1830 he turned his attention to the manufacture of steel dip pens by machinery. His company rapidly became successful and Gillott was soon a very wealthy man. It was rumoured locally that he buried some of his money in his cellar so that it did not become known that he had acquired so much. He certainly spread his cash across a number of bank accounts in Birmingham. In 1840 he opened his Victoria Works; the business employed mainly girls. Gillott also invested in the new railway companies and especially in property and land – not only in Birmingham, where he bought a large estate in Edgbaston, but also in London and Wales. The family home for many years was &quot;The Grove&quot; on Westbourne Road in Edgbaston.

Gillott was an often secretive man, both in business and in art collecting. He socialised with a small group of friends at the Hen and Chickens Hotel and the Theatre Royal (which he part-owned) in New Street, Birmingham.

== Art interests ==
Gillott was an art collector – at first he exchanged pens for paintings – and one of the first to recognise the merits of J. M. W. Turner. He also collected paintings by Richard Wilson, Richard Parkes Bonington, Thomas Gainsborough and John Constable. He recognized the work of John Linnell and was the first to give him a good price.
His collection of pictures, sold after his death, realised £170,000.

==Death and legacy==
Gillott died in Birmingham and was buried in Key Hill Cemetery.

A white marble bust of Gillott stands in the main foyer of Birmingham Council House.

In later years, Gillott&#x27;s son, Joseph Gillott junior, purchased a considerable estate in the village of Catherine-de-Barnes, Solihull on which he built New Berry Hall, a large gothic mansion with North and South Lodges. He also built the school in the village.

A collection of Gillott&#x27;s letters are held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham.

<doc id="376862" wikidata="Q2752989" url="?curid=376862" title="The Chosen (Potok novel)">
<text>The Chosen is a novel written by Chaim Potok. It was first published in 1967. It follows the narrator, Reuven Malter, and his friend Daniel Saunders, as they grow up in the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, in the 1940s. A sequel featuring Reuven&#x27;s young adult years, &quot;The Promise&quot;, was published in 1969.

==Plot==
In 1944 Brooklyn, fifteen-year-old Reuven Malter prepares to play a baseball game: his own Modern Orthodox school against a team from an ultra-orthodox Hasidic yeshiva. It becomes apparent that the only good player on the opposing team is Danny Saunders, the son of nearby Hasidic Rabbi Reb Saunders. The game becomes something of a war between the two teams, seemingly symbolic of their differing ideologies. In the last inning, with Reuven&#x27;s team in the lead, Reuven is put in as pitcher. When Danny gets up to the plate, he hits a line drive straight at Reuven&#x27;s head, which breaks his glasses and drives a small piece of glass into his eye. Reuven&#x27;s team loses and Reuven is rushed to the hospital.

Danny comes to the hospital in an attempt to apologize, but Reuven is still livid at Danny and rejects his attempts, which angers Reuven&#x27;s father, who reminds Reuven it is important to listen to someone who asks to be heard. When Danny returns the next day, Reuven forgives him and they quickly become friends. 

Reuven learns that Danny possesses a photographic memory, enabling him to study an astonishing amount of Talmud per day (set by his father), yet still leaving him time to pursue other subjects. Danny tells Reuven that he goes to the library to read books on science and literature, and that a man at the library has been recommending books for him to read. Danny knows that he is expected to someday take over his father&#x27;s position as the rabbi for his community, but wishes he did not have to and that instead, he could pursue psychology. Reuven would like to become a rabbi, though his father would like him to pursue academia. Reuven learns that his father, a teacher of Talmud, is the man who has been recommending books to Danny at the library. 

When Reuven is released from the hospital, his father discusses the history of Hasidism with him. He then explains that only once in a generation a mind like Danny&#x27;s is born, and that Danny cannot help his need for knowledge, but that Danny is also a lonely boy who needs a friend. 

The next day, Reuven goes to Danny&#x27;s family synagogue where he witnesses a discussion between Danny and his father which spans over the entire Talmud. After the Sabbath has ended, Danny reveals to Reuven that his father only speaks to him when they study Talmud together. The two boys also discover that they will be attending the same university, much to Reuven&#x27;s delight. That Sunday, Danny and Reuven meet at the library, where Danny reveals his fascination with the human mind and his desire to study the works of Sigmund Freud, for which he is teaching himself German. 

The next week, Reuven goes to the Saunders house again to study Talmud with Danny and his father. When Danny leaves the room to prepare tea, Rebbe Saunders reveals to Reuven that he knows about Danny&#x27;s visits to the library and wants to know what Danny is reading. He adds that he knows he cannot prevent Danny from pursuing knowledge, but that he fears his son will lose his Orthodox faith. Reuven immediately tells Danny about the talk, and later, Reuven&#x27;s father discerns that Reb Saunders used his conversation with Reuven to communicate with Danny indirectly. 

The coming year is dominated by the Allied victory in World War Two, and the death of Franklin Roosevelt, which brings grief to the Malters. In addition, news of the Holocaust reaches American soil, which sends all the characters, especially Rabbi Saunders, into a state of depression. During the summer of that year, Reuven&#x27;s father suffers a heart attack, and Reuven goes to stay in the Saunders home. At one meal, Reuven mentions that some feel it is time to establish a Jewish state, which sends Rabbi Saunders into a fierce tirade against Zionism: for the ultra-orthodox, a secular Jewish state established by man without the coming of the Messiah is against God&#x27;s will. 

The next year Danny and Reuven enter college at the Samson Raphael Hirsch College and Seminary. Danny is miserable because the psychology department at the university is only experimental psychology and not analytical. Eventually, Danny&#x27;s psychology professor tells him that he should go into clinical psychology. 

Later in the year, Reuven&#x27;s father gives a speech at a Zionist rally, which is covered by the Orthodox press, and leads Rabbi Saunders to forbid Danny to have any contact with Reuven. Reuven does not cope well without his best friend and his grades begin to suffer. Soon afterward Reuven&#x27;s father has a second heart attack followed by a lengthy hospitalization. Reuven copes with his father&#x27;s absence by studying the Talmud with greater intensity, eventually mastering a very complicated section of the Talmud. 

After two years, just as the violence in Mandatory Palestine comes to an end (the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war) and Reuven&#x27;s father has recovered from his heart attack, Danny is allowed to resume his friendship with Reuven because the Jewish state is now a fact, and no longer a point of dissension.

As the years pass, Danny&#x27;s father continues to remain silent with Danny. Danny reveals to Reuven that he will not take his father&#x27;s place. Instead, he will apply to graduate school and pursue a doctorate in clinical psychology, and his younger brother, Levi, will assume the tzaddikate. Danny applies to Harvard, Columbia, and Berkeley. He is accepted into all three universities, but cannot understand why his father does not speak to him about it, because the acceptance letters came by mail and were surely seen. 

On the first day of Passover in Danny and Reuven&#x27;s senior year of college, Reb Saunders invites Reuven to their home to talk with him and Danny. Reb Saunders tells Reuven that he knows that Danny will not be assuming the rabbinate, that he has known for a long time, and he accepts it. He then explains why he raised Danny in silence: he feared that Danny&#x27;s phenomenal intelligence would lead him to lack compassion for others. Therefore, he raised Danny in silence so that he could learn what it is to suffer, and therefore, have a soul. He also relates Danny to his older brother, who ran away from his homeland in Russia, became a secular professor and was murdered in Auschwitz. 

Reb Saunders expresses his gratitude to Reuven and his father for helping Danny at the point where he was ready to rebel, to help Danny remain a part of the Orthodox Jewish tradition, even if he cannot assume the rabbi role. To his father&#x27;s questions, Danny indicates that he will remove some of the visible indicators of Hasidism (his full beard and earlocks) but will remain an observer of the commandments. Reb Saunders says that Passover is the holiday of freedom and that he must let Danny be free. 

That September, on his way to graduate school at Columbia, Danny comes for a brief visit without his beard and earlocks. He says that he and his father now talk.

==Main characters==
Reuven (Robert or Bobby) Malter: a Modern Orthodox Jew, and a teenage boy. He is smart, popular in his community, and has a head for mathematics and logic. His father wants him to be a mathematician when he grows up, but he desires to become a rabbi.

Daniel (Danny) Saunders: a Hasidic Jew, who is also a teenager. Brilliant with a photographic memory, he is interested in psychology (particularly Freudian psychoanalysis) but is lacking in aptitude for mathematics. He wants to become a psychologist, but he feels trapped by the Hasidic tradition which forces him into the role as next in line to succeed his father as Rabbi and tzaddik. This fact is a prominent personal conflict for Danny throughout the book.

David Malter (Reuven&#x27;s father): a Talmudic scholar, writer, schoolteacher at his son&#x27;s yeshiva, motivational speaker on acts of Zionism and a Zionist himself. He is considered a heretic by the Hasidim. David supports the creation of the state of Israel because of his belief in the Messianic Age, rather than a literal Messiah.

Rabbi Isaac Saunders (Reb Saunders): Rabbinic sage and tzaddik. He is Danny&#x27;s father. Rabbi (spiritual leader/teacher) of a Hasidic group, whose role is dynastic (passed on from father to son). He moved his congregation from Russia to the United States before the October Revolution. He is against a secular Jewish nation-state because he believes this supersedes God&#x27;s will. He is also against all who identify as Zionists and follow the belief of a Messianic Age and wish for a secular Jewish nation-state.

==Literary themes==
Literary themes within the book include widespread references to senses (especially sight), the pursuit of truth in a gray world, the strength of friendship, and the importance of father-son bonds. Many themes common to Potok&#x27;s works prevail such as weak women and children, strong father figures, intellectual characters, and the strength and validity of faith in a modern secular world. Potok accentuates the importance of silence, and its role as a medium of communication. Throughout the book, there are numerous instances where Danny and Reuven both receive and process information in a non-verbal form. Potok explicitly introduces this topic by alluding to the relationship between Danny and his father, where there is no verbal communication between them, except during religious study. The two-year-long silence between Danny and Reuven, imposed by Reb Saunders, is also rich in communicative interactions between the two friends; however, it effectively shows the constraints that silence can impose between individuals.

Another important theme is the contrast of tradition to modernity. Reb Saunders insulates and isolates himself from the modern world, including Modern Orthodoxy, in everything from the method used to study Talmud to the creation of the state of Israel. This struggle between holding on to the traditions of one&#x27;s culture in an ever-changing world and taking on the culture of the adopted home country was also faced by Danny and Reuven, both of whom were raised in a different environment from their parents and have found themselves in such a situation. It reflects the struggle that many immigrants and their children experience after arriving in America.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
&quot;The Chosen&quot; was made into a movie in 1981, and a short-lived off-Broadway musical was produced in 1988. It closed after a week of performances. The book was adapted into a stage play by Potok and Aaron Posner and premiered at the Arden Theater in 1999. Potok wrote a sequel titled &quot;The Promise&quot;.

<doc id="376870" wikidata="Q753209" url="?curid=376870" title="Perry Rhodan">
<text>Perry Rhodan is a German space opera franchise, named after its hero. It commenced in 1961 and has been ongoing for decades, written by an ever-changing team of authors. Having sold approximately two billion copies (in novella format) worldwide (including over one billion in Germany alone), it is the most successful science fiction book series ever written. The first billion of worldwide sales was celebrated in 1986. The series has spun off into comic books, audio dramas, video games and the like. A reboot, &quot;Perry Rhodan NEO&quot;, was launched in 2011 and began publication in English in April 2021.

==Print publication==
The series has spun off into many different forms of media, but originated as a serial novella published weekly since 8 September 1961 in the &quot;Romanheft&quot; (Meaning &quot;Magazine novel&quot;) format. These are digest-sized booklets, usually containing 66 pages, the German equivalent of the now-defunct (and generally longer) American pulp magazine. They are published by Pabel-Moewig Verlag, a subsidiary of Bauer Media Group headquartered in Hamburg. As of February 2019, 3000 booklet novels of the original series, 850 spinoff novels of the sister series &quot;Atlan&quot; and over 400 paperbacks and 200 hardcover editions have been published, totalling over 300,000 pages.

==English translation==
The first 126 novels (plus five novels of the spinoff series &quot;Atlan&quot;) were translated into English and published by Ace Books between 1969 and 1978, with the same translations used for the British edition published by Futura Publications which issued only 39 novels. When Ace cancelled its translation of the series, translator Wendayne Ackerman self-published the following 19 novels (under the business name &#x27;Master Publications&#x27;) and made them available by subscription only. Financial disputes with the German publishers led to the cancellation of the American translation in 1979.

An attempt to revive the series in English was made in 1997–1998 by Vector Publications of the US which published translations of four issues (1800–1803) from the current storyline being published in Germany at the time.

The series and its spin-offs have captured a substantial fraction of the original German science fiction output and exert influence on many German writers in the field.

==Structure==
The series is told in an arc storyline structure. An arc—called a &quot;cycle&quot;—would have anywhere from 25 to 100 issues devoted to it, similar subsequent cycles are referred to as a &quot;grand-cycle&quot;.

==History==
‘Perry Rhodan, der Erbe des Universums’ (Eng: ‘The Heir to the Universe’, though the American/British editions instead used the subtitle &#x27;Peacelord of the Universe&#x27;) was created by German science fiction authors K. H. Scheer and Walter Ernsting and launched in 1961 by German publishing house Arthur Moewig Verlag (now Pabel-Moewig Verlag). Originally planned as a 30 to 50 volume series, it has been published continuously every week since, celebrating the 3000th issue in 2019. Written by an ever-changing team of authors, many of whom, however, remained with the series for decades or life, &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot; is issued in weekly novella-size installments in the traditional German &quot;Heftroman&quot; (pulp booklet) format. Unlike most German &quot;Heftromane&quot;, Perry Rhodan consists not of unconnected novels but is a series with a continuous, increasingly complex plotline, with frequent back references to events. In addition to its original &quot;Heftroman&quot; form, the series now also appears in hardcovers, paperbacks, e-books, comics and audiobooks.

Over the decades there have also been comic strips, numerous collectibles, several encyclopedias, audio plays, inspired music, etc. The series has seen partial translations into several languages. It also spawned the German-Italian-Spanish 1967 movie &quot;Mission Stardust&quot;, which is widely considered so terrible that many fans of the series pretend it never existed.

Coinciding with the 50th-anniversary World Con, on 30 September 2011, a new series named &quot;Perry Rhodan Neo&quot; began publication, attracting new readers with a reboot of the story, starting in the year 2036 instead of 1971, and a related but independent story-line. On April 2, 2021, light novel and manga publisher J-Novel Club announced &quot;Perry Rhodan NEO&quot; as a launch title for its new J-Novel Pulp imprint, making this the first ongoing English release of new &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot; serials in over 20 years.

It has become the most popular science fiction book series of all time.

==Overview==
===Premise===
The story begins in 1971. During the first human Moon landing by US Space Force Major Perry Rhodan and his crew, they discover a marooned extraterrestrial space ship from the fictional planet Arkon, located in the (real) M13 cluster. Appropriating the Arkonide technology, they proceed to unify Terra and carve out a place for humanity in the galaxy and the cosmos. Two of the accomplishments that enable them to do so are positronic brains and starship drives for near-instantaneous hyperspatial translation. These were directly borrowed from Isaac Asimov&#x27;s science fiction.

As the series progresses, major characters, including the title character, are granted relative immortality. They are immune to age and disease, but not to violent death. The story continues over the course of millennia and includes flashbacks thousands and even millions of years into the past. The scope widens to encompass other galaxies, even more remote regions of space, parallel universes and cosmic structures, time travel, paranormal powers, a variety of aliens ranging from threatening to endearing, and bodiless entities, some of which have godlike powers.

===Universe and multiverse===
The universe in which the plot regularly takes place is called the Einstein Universe (and occasionally &quot;Meekorah&quot;). Its laws are nearly identical to those of the real universe, in terms of late 20th century science. Newer theories about dark matter and dark energy are currently not used in the series. The laws of nature follow old theories that have been disproven, in order to protect series continuity.

This Einstein Universe is but one of many universes, each to a greater or lesser extent different from it, for example one in which time runs slower, an anti-matter universe, a shrinking universe, etc. Each universe possesses a large ensemble of parallel timelines, which are usually unreachable from each other but may be accessed by special means, thereby itself creating many more parallel timelines.

The Einstein Universe is embedded in a high-dimensional manifold, called Hyperspace. This hyperspace consists of several subspaces that different technologies use for faster-than-light travel. The exact traits of those higher dimensions are not much explained. The border of the universe is a dimension called &quot;the deep&quot;, once used for construction of the gigantic disc-shaped world Deepland.

===Psionic Web and Moral Code===
The &quot;Psionic Web&quot; crosses invisibly through the whole universe, constantly emitting &quot;vital energy&quot; and &quot;psionic energy&quot;, guaranteeing normal (organic among others) life and the wellbeing of higher entities.

The &quot;Moral Code&quot; crosses through all universes, and is linked to the Psionic Web. It is subdivided into the Cosmogenes, which are again subdivided into the Cosmonucleotids. The Cosmonucleotids determine reality and fate for their respective parts of a given universe, via &quot;messengers&quot;.

Higher beings are trying to gain control of this Code to rule reality. The Moral Code itself was not installed by the higher beings, the higher powers by themselves have no clue why or by whom the Code was made.

Once the Cosmocrats ordered Perry Rhodan to find the answer to the third ultimate question: &quot;Who initiated the LAW and what does it accomplish?&quot; Perry Rhodan had the chance to receive the answer at the mountain of creation, but refused, as he knew that the answer would destroy his mind. The negative Superintelligence Koltoroc had received the answer to the last ultimate question, 69 million years BC at Negane Mountain, but it is not known if it made any use of the information.

===Onion-shell model===
An evolutionary schema, similar to the Great Chain of Being, called the &quot;onion-shell model&quot; is employed in relationship to all life. Here, continuous evolution is from lower to higher lifeforms, culminating in bodiless entities. Later in the series, further lifeforms, representing stages between the known shells, were introduced.

The main shells are:
# Lifeless matter
# Bacteria
# Higher animals
# Intelligent species
# Intelligent species that have contacted other species
# Superintelligences (SI)
# Matter sources/ Matter sinks
# Cosmocrats / Chaotarchs (High Powers)
# Powers close to the &quot;Horizon of the LAW&quot;, the essence of the Multiverse

The Superintelligences are the next step above normal minds. They can be born, for example, when a species collectively gives up its bodies and unites their spirits. Such Superintelligences may claim as their domain areas consisting of up to several galaxies (the entity known as &quot;ES (&#x27;IT&#x27;)&quot; has the Local Group as its personal domain). The Superintelligence provides mental support to the species in its domain, sometimes symbiotically (positive SI), sometimes parasitically (negative SI).

The Matter Sources/Sinks are born when a Superintelligence fuses with all life and matter in its domain while shrinking. Little more is known except that the process is gradual and that the resulting object lacks the gravitational pull possessed if the contraction produced a black hole.

The &quot;high powers&quot; were long thought to be the highest known lifeforms. They live in an unimaginably distant dimension and have great powers in ruling over lower beings. However they are not omniscient and they are unable to directly interact with lower beings. To enter a regular universe they have to assume a mortal shape, thus reducing their powers and sometimes their knowledge and memory. This is known as the transform syndrome. As a consequence, they rarely interact with lower beings and instead enlist individuals, organizations or entire species.

===Conflict between the high powers===
Among the high powers are two factions known as the Cosmocrats and the Chaotarchs. The Cosmocrats wish to transform all universes into a state of absolute order (a state of utmost entropy, usual symbol S). The Chaotarchs wish to do the opposite and remake all universes into absolute chaos (or negative entropy). They are engulfed in a cataclysmic neverending war involving nearly all known universes. They manipulate and doom whole species for their actions. Open warfare is just one tool among many. In the 2300–2499 cycle the Milky Way galaxy was subjected to open military assault by the forces of chaos trying to establish a bastion of chaos, a Negasphere, in the nearby galaxy Hangay.

Recent stories have revealed to the protagonists that life itself has become a rival to the high powers. Spreading uncontrollably among the universe, it can be found in nearly every niche. The Cosmocrats and Chaotarchs both use life for their own directed goals of order and disorder, but life&#x27;s unplanned and unregulated cosmological actions are a disturbance for and to both. The Pangalactic Statisticians (a neutral organization of observers) have while some cosmological manipulation is caused by the cosmocrat servants and a lesser amount by the chaos servants, the majority is caused by the uncontrollable power of life itself. To reduce the influence of life, the Cosmocrats have stopped their programs that encourage the development of life and intelligence. They have increased the &quot;hyperimpedance&quot; in order to reduce the effectivity and durability of most forms of hypertechnology.

At least one power, called Thez, higher than either Cosmocrats and Chaotarchs has been recently identified. Thez is said to live close to the &quot;Horizon of the LAW&quot; so that both Cosmocrats and Chaotarchs have problems understanding it.

==Critical reaction==
In the introduction to the first English-language edition of Perry Rhodan in 1969, editor Forrest J Ackerman said &quot;[i]n Germany, all serious SF buffs claim to hate Perry Rhodan, but &quot;somebody&quot; (in unprecedented numbers) is certainly reading him.&quot;
Many American SF fans agreed with the first part of that statement, feeling the series was an embarrassment and too &quot;juvenile&quot;. Tom Doherty, the new head of Ace Books in the mid-to-late &#x27;70s, concurred and ended the series in the US, even though it was profitable. This decision meant that by 1980, when the original German versions of Perry Rhodan were becoming &quot;more sophisticated and less aimed at younger readers&quot;, the series was no longer available in English.

Critic Robert Reginald has described the series as the &quot;ultimate soap opera of science fiction&quot; and standard &quot;pulp science fiction, action stories with minimal characterization, awful dialog, but relatively complex plot development. The emphasis is always on man&#x27;s expanding horizons, the wonder of science and space, the great destiny of the human race.&quot;

The series&#x27; beginnings were often criticized for their description of an expansive mankind and frequent space battles; after William Voltz took over the position of storyline planner for the series in 1975 (a post he held until his death in 1984), the series developed a broader ethical scope and evolved in terms of storytelling style.

While some Anglophone critics dismiss the series, others praise it. In the US, the newer, more complex parts of the series have never been published, so critical review tends to be concentrated on the simple origins of the series. Editor John O&#x27;Neill has called Perry Rhodan &quot;one of the richest — if not the richest — Space Operas ever written.&quot;

==Publication==
===In English===
In the 1960s, Forrest J Ackerman organized the publication in the US of an English translation of the series. His wife Wendayne handled translation. Other translators on the series included Sig Wahrmann, Stuart J. Byrne, and Dwight Decker. Number 1, containing German issues 1 and 2, was published by Ace Books starting in 1969. As Managing Editor, Ackerman soon incorporated elements reminiscent of the science fiction pulp magazines of his youth, such as unrelated short stories, serialized novels and a film review section. The series was a commercial success and was eventually being published three times per month.

Ace ended its regular run of Perry Rhodan in August 1977 with double issue #117/118. This was followed by the publication of three novellas from earlier in the series which had not been translated and left out of the series by editorial decision. These were accompanied by three novellas from the Perry Rhodan spinoff series &quot;Atlan&quot;.

Ace concluded its run of translations with two more Atlan novels and a novel-length &quot;In the Center of the Galaxy&quot; [German: Im Zentrum der Galaxis] &#x27; by Clark Darlton, which had appeared in German as issue 11 of the &quot;Perry Rhodan Planet Novels&quot; (or Planetenromane) spin-off series.

When Ace cancelled its publication of the series in 1978, translator Wendayne Ackerman self-published the following 19 novels (numbered #119 – 137) under the business name Master Publications in a subscription-only edition. This was also cancelled in 1979. In the 1990s, Vector Enterprises restarted an American version. This version lasted for four printed issues and one electronic issue and translated #1800 to #1804.

In 2006, Pabel-Moewig Verlag licensed FanPro to publish an English translation of &quot;Perry Rhodan: Lemuria&quot;. (Some material present in the German version, such as a history of generation spaceships in science fiction, was dropped from the American version.) Only the first volume was released. In 2015–16, Perry Rhodan Digital published English translations of the full six volume &quot;Perry Rhodan: Lemuria&quot; story arc in ebook format, making these available via iTunes and other digital platforms.

=== Perry Rhodan NEO in English ===
In April 2021, light novel and manga publisher J-Novel Club announced &quot;Perry Rhodan NEO&quot; as one of three launch titles for its J-Novel Pulp imprint, dedicated to the best of European pulp fiction. Eight volumes, each containing two original German &quot;Hefte&quot;, or &quot;episodes&quot;, have been announced. J-Novel Club&#x27;s release uses the cover art by toi8 created for Hayakawa Publishing&#x27;s 2017 release.

In line with J-Novel Club&#x27;s light novel releases, new instalments are first serialized on J-Novel Club&#x27;s website over a number of weeks for subscribers. The first part of each volume is free for all visitors and requires no membership or subscription to read. Following web serialization, each volume is released as an Ebook at all major digital book retailers. J-Novel Club members who purchase the books directly receive textless versions of the cover art as a bonus.

Beginning with Volume 13, the English edition features newly commissioned art by toi8.
===In other countries===
Translations of Perry Rhodan are currently available in Brazil (#1 to #536 and #650 to #847 as of August 2011), and also from 537 to 649; 1400 in before (at present, in December 2014), including the series Atlan, Planetary Novels and Perry Rhodan NEO (at present in the n. 28), all launched by the &quot;Project Translation&quot;, Russia, China, Japan(#1 to #800 as of May 2011), France, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands (#1 to #2000 as of September 2009). Apart from the US version, there were also editions in Canada, Great Britain (#1 to #39), Italy and Finland. However, the latter have been discontinued.

The first language into which Perry Rhodan was translated was Hebrew. In 1965, the first four episodes appeared in Tel Aviv in a pirated translation, and which for unknown reasons ceased before publication of the fifth (it was not because it was detected by the German publishers, who only heard about it many years later). The few surviving copies of this 1965 translation are highly valued by Israeli collectors.

====Cycles====
The original series is divided into the following cycles and &quot;grand cycles&quot;. Only the grandcycles the Great Cosmic Mystery and Thoregon have official names. The other grandcycles were not planned as such. They were named by the readers in retrospect.
====American publication history====
* Ace Books
** #1 to #5—Double issues. Each volume contains two episodes. The German novel between episodes 4a and 4b, #0009 &quot;Hilfe fuer die Erde&quot;/&quot;Help for Earth&quot;, was initially skipped, but later printed as a Special Edition (&quot;The Atom-Men Attack&quot;).
** #6 to #108—Single issues. &quot;Maga-book&quot; format, or the style of a magazine in the format of a book. Two more skipped novels (&quot;lost&quot;) were 0021, &quot;Der Atomkrieg findet nicht statt&quot;/&quot;The atomic war doesn&#x27;t take place&quot; (between 014 &quot;Venus in Danger&quot; and 015 &quot;Thora&#x27;s Flight&quot;) and 0031 &quot;Der Kaiser von New York&quot;/&quot;The Ruler of New York&quot; (between 023 &quot;Peril on Ice Planet&quot; and 024 &quot;Infinity Flight&quot;). 0021 was finally printed as a Special, &quot;Menace of Atomigeddon&quot;, and 0031 as &quot;Robot Threat: New York&quot;.
Letter page and film reviews began in #6. Would later include short stories—old and new—and reprints of classic serialized novels such as &quot;Edison&#x27;s Conquest of Mars&quot; by Garrett P. Serviss (reprinted as &quot;Pursuit to Mars&quot;). Of special note is a lost chapter of the H.G. Wells novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot; that was published in this manner. Also serialized was William Ellern&#x27;s &quot;New Lensman&quot; novel.
** #109 to #118—double issues again, each one still separate.
** Perry Rhodan Specials #1 to #5—Double issues. #1 to #3 are skipped episodes (&quot;lost&quot;) published with an &quot;Atlan&quot; episode. #4 are two &quot;Atlan&quot; episodes and #5 (unnumbered) is a &quot;Planetenroman&quot;.
* Master Publications
** #119 to #136—Magazine size and format.
** #137—Book format. To fill out remaining subscription orders, the book format also printed Stuart J. Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Star Man&quot; series (expanded into novellas from Byrne&#x27;s novel of the same name). #137 was published with the first five episodes of &quot;Star Man&quot; in one volume. The remaining &quot;Star Man&quot; episodes were published as a separate volume.
* Vector Enterprises
** #1800 to #1803—Magazine format. #1800 is published in a manner similar to the German series. 1801 to 1803 are large-sized magazine format.
** #1804—Electronic format only.
* FanPro Games (American operation of German company FanPro)
** Lemuria #1 &quot;The Star Ark.&quot;

Copies of the Ace books and the rarer magazine versions can be found in online auction sites such as eBay and fixed-price online stores like Amazon.com. Used bookstores often have some of the Ace books, but rarely the magazine versions.

==Cultural impact==
===In current events===
Matthias Rust, the then-18 year old aviator who landed his Cessna 172 aircraft on the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge which connects the Red Square in Moscow in 1987, cited Perry Rhodan&#x27;s adventures as his main inspiration for penetrating Soviet airspace.
Dutch ESA astronaut André Kuipers was inspired to become an astronaut from an early age by the Perry Rhodan albums his grandmother had bought for him, and that he eventually started buying himself from his allowance. When he finally went into space, on 18 April 2004, he brought his very first booklet along with him. It was number ten in the red series, &quot;Ruimteoorlog in de Wegasector&quot; (&quot;Space War in the Vega Sector&quot; or &quot;Raumschlacht im Wega-Sektor&quot;).

===In music===
Christopher Franke, former member of German electronica group Tangerine Dream and soundtrack composer for US science-fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, released &quot;Perry Rhodan Pax Terra&quot; in 1996, composed of music inspired by the &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot; epic.

The German group The Psychedelic Avengers have said that they were inspired by &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot; on their 2004 release &quot;And the Curse of the Universe&quot;. Another group, Sensus, released a song &quot;Perry Rhodan .. More Than A Million Lightyears From Home&quot; in 1986 a presented it at the Worldcon in Saarbrücken.

===In video games===
In 1995, the Czech computer adventure video game &quot;Mise Quadam&quot; was created based on the motifs of the series. In 2008, was released the computer game &quot;The Immortals of Terra: A Perry Rhodan Adventure&quot; (&quot;Rhodan: Myth of the Illochim&quot;).

===In science fiction fandom===
Bubonicon, an annual science fiction convention in Albuquerque, New Mexico, US, adopted as its mascot Perry Rhodent, a rat wearing only one shoe (or boot). Perry&#x27;s image is reinvented each year for the convention&#x27;s program and T-shirts, often by the convention&#x27;s Artist Guest of Honor.

<text>George Richards Elkington (17 October 1801 – 22 September 1865) was a manufacturer from Birmingham, England. He patented the first commercial electroplating process.

== Biography ==
Elkington was born in Birmingham, the son of a spectacle manufacturer. Apprenticed to his uncles&#x27; silver plating business in 1815, he became, on their death, sole proprietor of the business, but subsequently took his cousin, Henry Elkington, into partnership. The science of electrometallurgy was then in its infancy, but the Elkingtons were quick to recognize its possibilities. They had already taken out certain patents for the application of electricity to metals when, in 1840, John Wright, a Birmingham surgeon, discovered the valuable properties of a solution of cyanide of silver in potassium cyanide for electroplating purposes. The Elkingtons purchased and patented Wright&#x27;s process (British Patent 8447 : Improvements in Coating, Covering, or Plating certain Metals), subsequently acquiring the rights of other processes and improvements. In 1843 Elkingtons acquired the rights to Werner von Siemens&#x27;s first invention, an improvement to the gold and silver plating process.

The Elkingtons opened a new electroplating works in Newhall Street, in the Jewellery Quarter, Birmingham in 1841, and the following year Josiah Mason, a pen manufacturer, joined the firm and encouraged the Elkingtons to diversify their output, adding more affordable electroplated jewellery and cutlery to the large pieces the company had been producing. Electroplated wares became very successful in the Victorian market and by 1880 the company employed 1,000 people at the Newhall Street site and had a further six factories. The agreement between Elkington and Mason was dissolved on 31 December 1861, after which the company traded as Elkington and Co.
There is a Blue Plaque commemorating him on the old Elkington Silver Electroplating Works, Newhall Street, Birmingham.

==Family==

He married Mary Auster Balleney in 1825 and had seven surviving children, Frederick, George, James, Alfred, Howard, Hyla and one girl, Emma. Mary Auster died in 1858 and was buried in St. Mary&#x27;s churchyard, Selly Oak, Birmingham and in 1860 he married secondly Margaret Morgan Jones.

On his death in 1865 he left £350,000 and his business to be continued by four of his sons, Frederick, James, Alfred and Howard.

Stained-glass windows were erected in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Selly Oak in memory of both wives and of him. George had made a substantial contribution towards the construction of this church.

His grandfather was the land drainage reformer Joseph Elkington.

<doc id="376875" wikidata="Q2049478" url="?curid=376875" title="Television in the Netherlands">
<text>Television in the Netherlands was officially introduced in 1951. In the Netherlands, the television market is divided between a number of commercial networks, such as RTL Nederland, and a system of public broadcasters sharing three channels, NPO 1, NPO 2, and NPO 3. Imported programmes (except those for children), as well as news interviews with responses in a foreign language, are almost always shown in their original language, with subtitles.

==Reception==
In the Netherlands, television can be watched analog or digital (the latter with the option of HDTV or UHD). Over 2018, 89.2% of Dutch viewers received television digitally. Analogue television is only available via some cable operators and some fiber to the home providers, since the Dutch government ended analogue reception via airwaves in 2006. Dutch largest cable company Ziggo began to phase out the analogue signal in 2018. Watching digital television is possible through a variety of ways, the most common being:
*Digital television over cable (in most cases through a set-top box with a smart card or through a Conditional-access module).
**Ziggo is the major supplier of cable television in the Netherlands. Other companies are Caiway, DELTA, Kabelnoord and a few smaller local companies.
*Satellite television
**Canal Digitaal is the only satellite provider.
*Digital terrestrial television
**KPN Digitenne is the only terrestrial provider.
*Internet television (IPTV)
**KPN, Tele2 and T-Mobile are the major suppliers of IPTV.
*Fiber to the home
** KPN is the major operator of FTTH with its subsidiaries KPN Glasvezel, Glashart and Reggefiber. Other companies are Caiway and DELTA.

Which television channels can be received is heavily dependent on the operator and in most cases also the channel package that is paid for. However, there is a small selection of channels that every operator must carry. Since 2014, these are the following channels:
*NPO 1
*NPO 2
*NPO 3
*VRT 1 (Flanders (Belgium))
*VRT Canvas (Flanders (Belgium))
*Ketnet (Flanders (Belgium))
*Regional (provincial) broadcasters (when available) 
*Local broadcaster (when available)

==Public channels==
The Netherlands has three nationwide channels for publicly funded television (NPO). These channels can only make a fixed maximum amount of money from commercials. These commercials never interrupt broadcasts, and are only shown in between shows. The broadcasting organisations that use these channels are basically representative of the Dutch society. Every broadcasting company has members and the number of members gives them a status that is connected to the number of hours of broadcasting. Acceptance or refusal of entry is decided politically on the guidance of public opinion.

In 2005, there was a sharp political debate over government plans to cut funding to public broadcasters and to abolish statutory broadcaster NPS.

==High-definition==
In the Netherlands customers can receive high-definition television channels by cable or satellite. Until 2018 there was no terrestrial HD service available. KPN started to switch its digital terrestrial television platform to the DVB-T2 HEVC standard in October 2018, this transition completed on 9 July 2019.

The first trials with high-definition television in the Netherlands began in 2006 with the broadcast of the 2006 World Cup in HD. After the trial the larger cable companies continued a HD service with a small number of channels such as National Geographic Channel HD, Discovery HD Showcase, History HD, Film1 HD and Sport1 HD. The demand for HD was low because no Dutch network had made the move to HD. Broadcasting in widescreen and the quality of the standard-definition PAL signal was good enough for most people.

Since the 2006 trials, none of the main Dutch networks made the move to HD. This changed in the summer of 2008 when from 1 June 2008 until 24 August 2008, the Netherlands Public Broadcasting (NPO) organisations made their primary channel, Nederland 1 temporary available in HD. This made it possible to broadcast Euro 2008, the 2008 Tour de France, and the 2008 Summer Olympics in HD and additionally allowed them to test their systems before the scheduled launch of their permanent HD service in early 2009. The NPO planned to launch their permanent HD service with HD versions of their three channels Nederland 1, Nederland 2, and Nederland 3. Most of the programming in the early stages consisted of upscaled material from their SD channels as in time more programs became available in HD. , the company responsible for the technical realisation of the broadcasts of the NPOs television and radio channels, began the summer 2008 test broadcast of Nederland 1 HD in 720p/50 as the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) recommends. During the test period an additional 1080i/25 version of the channel was made available to the cable companies because of quality complaints from viewers. In 2009 the NPO decided to adopt the 1080i/25 HD standard.

The main commercial broadcasting organizations in the Netherlands the SBS Broadcasting Group (NET 5, SBS 6, Veronica) and the channels of RTL Nederland followed in HD via cable and satellite, using the same HD standard as the NPO.

==Ultra-high-definition==
The first television channels in 4K UHD were officially launched in the Netherlands in 2017. In April 2017, satellite provider CanalDigitaal added Insight TV 4K UHD in its channel line-up. After more than a year of testing, KPN launched ultra-high-definition television on 1 July 2017, with Xite 4K and Hispasat 4K TV. Eurosport 4K launched in the Netherlands on 5 June 2018. NPO 1 launched its first trials with ultra-high-definition television through KPN, CanalDigitaal and some minor networks on 14 June 2018, using the HLG standard. Ziggo Sport is available in UHD from March 2021.

==Television in other languages==
To serve those who have another native language than Dutch, there are few television channels in the Netherlands broadcasting in one of the regional languages of The Netherlands. Those broadcasting in English usually target an international audience as well. Most of these channels broadcast through the internet only or have a very limited broadcasting area, with Omrop Fryslân as most notable exception. These channels are:
* Omrop Fryslân (Frisian), public access regional broadcaster in the province of Friesland
* Froeks.tv (Frisian), web-only channel for Friesland
* Radio Netherlands Worldwide (English), produces vodcasts on their website in English
* ThreeNL (English), reruns of Dutch public access programmes either English subtitled or dubbed
* AFTV-African Television (English), available in The Hague and online, targeting Africans in The Netherlands
* NOS TV (Papiamento), available on Bonaire and online; local Bonaire TV station.
* RTV-7 (Papiamento, English), available on Ziggo, XS4ALL and KPN. Rebroadcast of Antillian TV Channels in the Netherlands

<text>The Emin Pasha Relief Expedition of 1887 to 1889 was one of the last major European expeditions into the interior of Africa in the nineteenth century. Led by Henry Morton Stanley, its goal was ostensibly the relief of Emin Pasha, the besieged Egyptian governor of Equatoria (part of modern-day South Sudan), who was threatened by Mahdist forces. 

Stanley set out to traverse the continent with a force of nearly 700 men, navigating up the Congo River and then through the Ituri rainforest to reach East Africa. The arduous journey caused Stanley to split the expedition into two columns; the advance column eventually reached Emin Pasha in July 1888. A series of mutinies, disagreements, and miscommunications forced Stanley and Emin to withdraw from Equatoria in early 1889.

The expedition was initially celebrated for its ambition in crossing &quot;Darkest Africa&quot;. However, soon after Stanley returned to Europe, it gained notoriety for the deaths of so many of its members and reports of brutality. It was the last large-scale private expedition undertaken as part of the Scramble for Africa.

== Background ==

With the capture of Khartoum by the Mahdists (followers of Islamic religious leader Muhammad Ahmad) in 1885, the Ottoman-Egyptian administration of Sudan collapsed. Equatoria, the extreme southern province of the Sudan, was nearly cut off from the outside world, as it was located on the upper reaches of the Nile near Lake Albert. Emin Pasha was a German Jewish-born Ottoman doctor and naturalist who had been appointed Governor of Equatoria by Charles George Gordon, the British general who himself had attempted to relieve Khartoum. Emin, able to send and receive letters via Buganda and Zanzibar, had been informed in February 1886 that the Egyptian government would abandon Equatoria. In July, he was encouraged by missionary Alexander Mackay to invite the British government to annex Equatoria itself. The government was not interested in such a doubtful venture, but the British public came to see Emin as a second General Gordon, in mortal danger from the Mahdists.

Scottish businessman and philanthropist William Mackinnon had been involved in various colonial ventures, and by November he had approached Stanley about leading a relief expedition. Stanley declared himself ready &quot;at a moment&#x27;s notice&quot; to go. Mackinnon then approached James Frederick Hutton, a business acquaintance also involved in colonial activities, and together they organized the &quot;Emin Pasha Relief Committee&quot;, mostly consisting of Mackinnon&#x27;s friends, among them Francis de Winton. Their first meeting took place on 19 December 1886. The Committee raised a total of about £32,000.

Stanley was officially still in the employment of Leopold II of Belgium, by whom he had been employed in carving out Leopold&#x27;s &#x27;Congo Free State&#x27;. As a compromise for letting Stanley go, it was arranged in a meeting in Brussels between Stanley and the king, that the expedition would take a longer route up the Congo River, contrary to plans for a shorter route inland from the eastern African coast. In return, Leopold would provide his Free State steamers for the transportation of the expedition up the river, from Stanley Pool (now Pool Malebo) as far as the mouth of the Aruwimi River.

By 1 January 1887, Stanley was back in London preparing the expedition to widespread public acclaim. Stanley himself was intent that the expedition be one of humanitarian assistance rather than of military conquest. He declared:

=== Purpose of expedition ===
In a number of publications made after the expedition, Stanley asserted that the singular purpose of the effort was to offer relief to Emin Pasha.

However, Stanley&#x27;s other writings point to a secondary goal — territorial annexation. In his account of the expedition, he implied that his meeting with the Sultan of Zanzibar was in regards to British interests in East Africa. These interests were threatened not only by the Mahdists, but also by German imperial ambitions in the region; Germany would not recognize British suzerainty over Zanzibar (and its continental holdings) until 1890.

The records at the National Archives at Kew, London, offer an even deeper insight and show that annexation was a purpose he had been aware of for the expedition. This is because there are a number of treaties curated there (and gathered by Stanley himself from what is present day Uganda during the Emin Pasha Expedition), ostensibly gaining British protection for a number of African chiefs. Amongst these were a number that have long been identified as possible frauds. A good example is treaty number 56, supposedly agreed upon between Stanley and the people of &quot;Mazamboni, Katto, and Kalenge&quot;. These people had signed over to Stanley &quot;the Sovereign Right and Right of Government over our country for ever in consideration of value received and for the protection he has accorded us and our Neighbours against KabbaRega and his Warasura&quot;.

== Preparations ==

The expedition was planned to go to Cairo, then to Zanzibar to hire porters, then south of Africa, around the Cape to the mouth of the Congo, up the Congo by Leopold&#x27;s steamers, branching off at the Aruwimi River. Stanley intended to establish a camp on the Aruwimi, then go east overland through unknown territory to reach Lake Albert and Equatoria. He then expected that Emin would send the families of Emin&#x27;s Egyptian employees back along the just-pioneered route, along with a large store of ivory accumulated in Equatoria, while Stanley, Emin, and Emin&#x27;s soldiers would proceed eastward to Zanzibar. Coincidentally, public doubts over the plan centered around whether it could be achieved; the possibility that Emin might not want to leave seems not to have been considered.

The expedition was the largest and best-equipped to go to Africa; a 28-foot steel boat named the &quot;Advance&quot; was designed to be divided into 12 sections for carrying over land, and Hiram Maxim presented the expedition with one of his recently invented Maxim guns, which was the first to be brought to Africa. Merely &#x27;exhibiting&#x27; the gun was thought to be a scare, which would spare the expedition problems with hostile natives.

The Relief Committee received 400 applications by hopeful participants. From these, Stanley chose the officers who were to accompany him to Africa:
* James Sligo Jameson, John Rose Troup, and Herbert Ward had all travelled in Africa before, Jameson as a big game hunter, artist, and traveller, and Troup and Ward as employees of the Congo Free State.
* Robert Henry Nelson, William Bonny, William Grant Stairs, and Edmund Musgrave Barttelot were all military men. Barttelot had been doing service in India.
* Arthur Jephson was a young &#x27;gentleman of leisure&#x27; coming from the merchant marine who was hired on the quality of his face only, but he paid £1,000 to the Relief Committee, as did Jameson, in order to participate in the expedition.
* The expedition&#x27;s doctor Thomas Heazle Parke was hired at the last minute, while the expedition was already en route, in Alexandria, where he was doing military service.
* William Hoffmann was Stanley&#x27;s personal servant, curiously enough scarcely mentioned at all in Stanley&#x27;s own account of the events.

Stanley departed London on 21 January 1887 and arrived in Cairo on 27 January. Egyptian objections to the Congo route were overridden by a telegram from Lord Salisbury, and the expedition was permitted to march under the Egyptian flag. Stanley also met with Mason Bey, Schweinfurth, and Junker, who had more up-to-date information about Equatoria.

Stanley left Cairo on 3 February, joined up with expedition members during stops in Suez and Aden, and arrived in Zanzibar on 22 February. The next three days were spent packing for the expedition, loading the &quot;Madura&quot;, and negotiating. Stanley acted as a representative of Mackinnon in convincing the Sultan of Zanzibar to grant a concession for what later became the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC), and made two agreements with Tippu Tib. The first included appointing him as Governor of Stanley Falls, an arrangement much criticized in Europe as a deal with a slave-trader, and the second agreement regarded the provisions of carriers for the expedition. In addition to transporting stores, the carriers were now also expected to bring out some 75 tons of ivory stored in Equatoria. Stanley posted letters to Emin predicting his arrival on Lake Albert around August.

== Up the Congo ==
The expedition left Zanzibar on 25 February and, rounding the Cape of Good Hope, arrived at Banana at the mouth of the Congo on 18 March. Their arrival was somewhat unexpected, because a telegraph cable had broken and local officials had received no instructions. Chartered steamers brought the expedition to Matadi, where the carriers took over, bringing some 800 loads of stores and ammunition to Leopoldville on the Stanley Pool. Progress was slow, since the rainy season was at its height, and food was short – a problem that was to be persistent throughout the expedition (the area along the route rarely had spare food for 1,000 hardworking men, as it was a subsistence economy).
On 21 April, the expedition arrived at Leopoldville. King Leopold had promised a flotilla of river steamers, but only one worked: the &quot;Stanley&quot;. Stanley requisitioned two (&quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;Henry Reed&quot;) from missionaries of the Baptist Mission and the Livingstone Inland Mission, whose protests were overridden, as well as the &quot;Florida&quot;, which was still under construction and so used as a barge. Even these were insufficient, so many of the stores were left at Leopoldville and more at Bolobo. At this point, Stanley also announced the division of the expedition: a &quot;rear column&quot; would encamp at Yambuya on the Aruwimi, while the &quot;Advance Column&quot; pressed on to Equatoria.

The voyage up the Congo started 1 May and was generally uneventful. At Bangala Station, Barttelot and Tippu Tib continued up to Stanley Falls in the &quot;Henry Reed&quot;, while Stanley took the Aruwimi to Yambuya. The inhabitants of Yambuya refused permission to reside in their village, so Stanley attacked and drove the villagers away, turning the deserted village into a fortified camp. Meanwhile, at Stanley Falls, Tippu Tib attempted to acquire carriers, but he believed that Stanley had broken his part of their agreement by leaving ammunition behind, and Barttelot came to Yambuya with only an indefinite promise that carriers would arrive in several weeks.

== Traversing the Ituri Rainforest ==
Stanley, however, insisted on speed, and left for Lake Albert on 28 June, originally expecting to take two months. The Advance Column, however, was unprepared for the extreme difficulties of travel through the Ituri rainforest and did not reach the lake until December. Only 169 of the 389 who set out from Yambuya were still alive. The trees of the forest were so tall and dense that little light reached the floor, food was scarcely to be found, and the local Pygmies took the expedition for an Arab raiding party, shooting at them with poisoned arrows. The expedition stopped at two Arab settlements, Ugarrowwa&#x27;s and Ipoto, in each case leaving more of their equipment behind in exchange for food.

The forest eventually gave way to grassland, and on 13 December the expedition was looking down on Lake Albert. However, Emin was not there, and the locals had not seen a European in many years. Stanley decided to return to the village of Ibwiri on the plateau above the lake, where they built Fort Bodo. Stairs went back to Ipoto to collect men and equipment, and returned 12 February. A second trip went back to Ugarrowwa&#x27;s to collect more equipment. Meanwhile, on 2 April Stanley returned to Lake Albert, this time with the &quot;Advance&quot;. On 18 April they received a letter from Emin, who had heard about the expedition a year earlier, and had come down the lake in March after hearing rumors of Stanley&#x27;s arrival.

== Stanley meets Emin ==
Jephson was sent on ahead to the lake with the &quot;Advance&quot;, took the boat up to Mswa, and met Emin on 27 April 1888. Emin brought his steamer to the south end of the lake, and met Stanley there on the 29th, who was surprised to find the figure of Emin to have &quot;not a trace on it of ill-health or anxiety&quot;, and celebrated with three bottles of champagne that had been carried all the way up the Congo. Emin provided Stanley with food and other supplies, thus rescuing the rescuers.

At this point things became difficult. Emin was primarily interested in ammunition and other supplies, and a communications route, all of which would assist him in remaining in Equatoria, while Stanley&#x27;s main goal was to bring Emin out. A month of discussion produced no agreement, and on 24 May Stanley went back to Fort Bodo, arriving there 8 June and meeting Stairs, who had returned from Ugarrowwa&#x27;s with just fourteen surviving men. On the way Stanley saw the Ruwenzori Mountains for the first time (although Parke and Jephson had seen them on 20 April).

== Fate of the rear column ==
On 16 June, Stanley left the fort in search of the rear column; no word of or from them had been received in a long time. Finally, on 17 August at Banalya, 90 miles upstream from Yambuya, Stanley found Bonny, the sole European left in charge of the column, along with a handful of starving carriers. Barttelot had been shot in a dispute, Jameson was at Bangala dying of a fever, Troup had been invalided home, and Herbert Ward had gone back down the Congo a second time to telegraph the Relief Committee in London for further instructions (the column had not heard from Stanley in over a year). The original purpose of the rear column – to wait for the additional carriers from Tippu Tib – had not been accomplished, since without the ammunition supplied by the expedition, Tippu Tib had nothing with which to recruit. After several side trips, Barttelot decided to send Troup and the others on the sick list down the Congo, and 11 June 1888, after the arrival of a group of Manyema bringing Barttelot&#x27;s total to 560, set off in search of Stanley.

But the march soon disintegrated into chaos, with large-scale desertion and multiple trips to try to bring up stores; then on 19 July Barttelot was shot while trying to interfere with a Manyema festival. Jameson decided to go down to Bangala to bring up extra loads and left on 9 August, shortly before Stanley&#x27;s arrival. Stanley was incensed at the state of the rear column, blaming them for lack of motion despite his previous orders that they wait for him at Yambuya. From surviving officers Stanley also heard stories of Barttelot&#x27;s brutality and of another officer, James Sligo Jameson, who was alleged to have purchased a young female slave and given her to cannibals so he could record her being killed and eaten. In his posthumously published diary, Jameson admitted that he had indeed paid for the girl and watched as she was butchered, but claimed that he considered the whole affair a joke and had not expected her to actually be killed.

According to the testimony of Jameson&#x27;s colleague William Bonny, Jameson must have stayed around to watch while the girl was cooked and consumed, since the last of his six sketches (which he had shown Bonny) &quot;represents the feast.&quot; The &quot;six handkerchiefs&quot; Jameson had paid were indeed valuable enough to purchase a child slave, and Jameson&#x27;s diary also shows that he was well informed of cannibal customs and had even seen remainders of a cannibal meal before, making his line of defense doubtful.
After the dispatch of a number of letters down-Congo, the expedition returned to Fort Bodo, taking a different route that proved no better for food supply, and it reached the Fort on 20 December, now reduced to 412 men, of whom 124 were too ill to carry any loads. On 16 January 1889, near Lake Albert, Stanley received letters from Emin and Jephson, who had been made prisoner by Emin&#x27;s officers for several months, while at the same time the Mahdists had been capturing additional stations of Equatoria. Since Stanley&#x27;s arrival, numerous rumours had gone around about Emin&#x27;s intentions and the likely fate of the soldiers, and in August of the previous year matters had come to a head; a number of officers rebelled, deposed Emin as governor, and kept him and Jephson under a sort of house arrest in Dufile until November. Even so, Emin was still reluctant to abandon the province.

== Withdrawal to the coast ==
By 17 February all the surviving members of the expedition, and Emin with a group of about 65 loyal soldiers, met at Stanley&#x27;s camp above Lake Albert, and during the subsequent weeks several hundred more of Emin&#x27;s followers, many of them the families of the soldiers, assembled there. Emin still had not expressed a firm intention to leave Equatoria, and 5 April, after a heated argument, Stanley determined to leave shortly, and the expedition departed Kavalli&#x27;s for the coast on 10 April.

The trip to the coast passed first south, along the western flank of the Ruwenzoris, and Stairs attempted to ascend to a summit, reaching 10,677 ft before having to turn around. They then passed by Lake Edward and Lake George, then across to the southernmost point of Lake Victoria, passing through the kingdoms of Ankole and Karagwe. Stanley made &quot;treaties&quot; with the various rulers; although it is most likely that these were not regarded as such by the locals, they were later used to establish IBEAC claims in the area.

Lake Victoria was seen on 15 August, and the expedition reached Mackay&#x27;s missionary station at Usambiro on 28 August. At this point they began to learn of the complicated changing situation in East Africa, with European colonial powers scrambling to stake their claims, and a second relief expedition under Frederick John Jackson. After waiting fruitlessly for news of the Jackson expedition, Stanley left on 17 September, with a party now reduced to some 700 by a combination of death and desertion.

As the expedition approached the coast, they encountered parties of Germans and other signs of German activity in the interior, and were met by commissioner Wissmann on 4 December and escorted into Bagamoyo. That evening a banquet was held, during which an inebriated Emin fell out of a second-storey window he mistook for a balcony, and from which he did not recover until the end of January 1890. In the meantime, the rest of the expedition had dispersed; Stanley went to Zanzibar and then to Cairo, where he wrote the 900 pages of &quot;In Darkest Africa&quot; in just 50 days. The Zanzibari carriers were paid off or (in the case of prisoners) returned to their masters, the Sudanese and Egyptians were transported back to Egypt, some later returning to work for the IBEAC. Emin took service with the Germans in February, and the other Europeans returned to England.

== Aftermath ==
Stanley returned to Europe in May 1890 to tremendous public acclaim; both he and his officers received numerous awards, honorary degrees, and speaking engagements. In June alone his newly published book sold 150,000 copies. But the adulation was to be short-lived.

By autumn, as the true cost of the expedition became known, and as the families of Barttelot and Jameson reacted to Stanley&#x27;s accusations of incompetence in the rear column, criticism and condemnation became widespread. Samuel Baker called the story of the rear column &quot;the most horrible and indecent exposure that I have ever heard of seen in print&quot;. Stanley&#x27;s own use of violence during the expedition also revived old criticisms that he was a &quot;sham explorer&quot; as well as doubts over the supposed humanitarian value of European exploration in Africa. In the end, the Emin Pasha Relief Expedition came to be the last expedition of its type; future African expeditions would be government-run in pursuit of military or political goals, or conducted purely for science.

An Anglo-Egyptian force under Lord Kitchener managed to reconquer Sudan from the Mahdists in 1899. Equatoria was incorporated as part of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, nominally under British administration, though it remained isolated and underdeveloped well into the 20th century.

From 1898 to 1900, a devastating sleeping sickness epidemic spread into territories that are now Democratic Republic of the Congo, western Uganda and south of Sudan. Native cattle traveling with the expedition may have introduced the parasite into previously-unaffected regions. However, not all authors agree.

==In popular culture==
It has been suggested that stories of the expedition — in particular, the disastrous plight of the &quot;rear column&quot; — inspired Joseph Conrad in his 1899 novella &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;. Critic Adam Hochschild suggests that the character of Kurtz, the isolated and insane Congo trader, was modeled on Barttelot, who &quot;went mad, began hitting, whipping, and killing people, and was finally murdered&quot;. Harold Bloom also connected the portrayal of Kurtz with the figures of Stanley and Tippu Tib.

The fate of the rear column is the subject of Simon Gray&#x27;s 1978 play &quot;The Rear Column&quot;, which features Barttelot, Jameson, Ward, Bonny, Troup and Stanley as characters.

<text>Looking Glass Studios, Inc. (formerly Blue Sky Productions and LookingGlass Technologies, Inc.) was an American video game developer based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was founded by Paul Neurath with Ned Lerner as Blue Sky Productions in 1990, and merged with Lerner&#x27;s Lerner Research in 1992 to become LookingGlass Technologies. Between 1997 and 1999, the company was part of Intermetrics and was renamed Looking Glass Studios. Following financial issues at Looking Glass, the studio shut down in May 2000.

Notable productions by Looking Glass include the &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot;, &quot;System Shock&quot; and &quot;Thief&quot; series.

== History ==
=== Blue Sky Productions, Lerner Research, and &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; (1990–1992) ===
Co-founders of Looking Glass, Paul Neurath and Ned Lerner, met at Wesleyan University where Lerner was a physics major and Neurath studied environmental science. The two worked together on the game &quot;Deep Space: Operation Copernicus&quot; (1987) before Lerner moved to the West Coast where he worked creating games for Electronic Arts. Neurath found work at Origin Systems, who had moved their business to New Hampshire in 1984. Neurath worked on a number of projects including &quot;Ogre&quot; (1986) and &quot;Omega&quot; (1989). His largest project was leading the design of &quot;Space Rogue&quot; (1989), which he collaborated with Lerner on many of the technical aspects. &quot;Space Rogue&quot; was in turn a major inspiration for &quot;Wing Commander&quot; (1990) due to its melding of storytelling and space combat elements.

Before the completion of &quot;Space Rogue&quot;, Origin Systems moved back to Texas along with the majority of the staff. Neurath, not wanting to move, decided to use the former Origin office to start his own studio, Blue Sky Productions, at 59 Stiles Road in Salem, New Hampshire in 1990. Lerner, who had his own company called Lerner Research, supplied funds to help get the operation off the ground.

With a concept to create a first-person dungeon crawler in the vein of &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; (1987), Neurath began recruiting from the local region. One of his early hires was Doug Church, programmer and graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Church working together with Chris Green of Lerner Research developed a basic three-dimensional, texture mapped demonstration of the game with animation by former Origin artist Douglas Wike. The demo was showcased at the 1990 Summer Consumer Electronics Show to attract publisher interest. Richard Garriott and Warren Spector of Origin Systems saw the demo and decided to finance their first game.

The demo, initially named &quot;Underworld&quot;, was rebranded under the &quot;Ultima&quot; series. The initial funding for the game was purportedly $30,000, allowing Neurath to hire his initial staff into Blue Sky Productions. The final cost of production was around $400,000 and would be released in March 1992 as &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; (1992). By the end of production on &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot;, the company had moved to a new office in Lexington, Massachusetts.

=== LookingGlass Technologies (1992-1996) ===
Blue Sky Productions began work on the sequel to &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; while Neurath and Lerner spoke about merging their two companies. Lerner Research was fresh off the completion of &quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; (1992) and had been granted a license to develop EA&#x27;s next &quot;Madden&quot; title for the Sega Genesis for which they needed more development support. The two decided on a name change in order to differentiate themselves from the game company Blue Sky Software. Initially they used the name &quot;Flying Fish Designs&quot; but eventually settled on Looking Glass. The name was chosen both as a reference to the book Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll and to the idea that their game worlds transported people to new worlds. They initially considered &quot;Looking Glass Studios&quot; but decided that their specialty was more in technology.

LookingGlass Technologies Inc. was incorporated on June 29, 1992 with Neurath as President and Ned Lerner as Vice President and Treasurer. &quot;John Madden Football &#x27;93&quot; (1992) was the first game released by the new studio, with &quot;Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds&quot; (1993) following. Origin became a subsidiary of Electronic Arts in September 1992; EA handled all future publishing arrangements with the studio.

The experienced development team led by Doug Church developed &quot;System Shock&quot; (1994), a pioneering combination of first-person shooter mechanics and immersive systems. The game was decently successful, but initially released on floppy disk which cut out the voiced dialog in its data entry logs, a novel narrative technique for which the game became known. The CD-ROM version utilized voice acting developed by an internal sound team, made up of members from the local band Tribe: Greg LoPiccolo, Eric Brosius, and Terri Brosius – also voice of &quot;System Shock&quot;″s villain SHODAN – who later moved into a game design role.

LookingGlass moved to a new facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts in Fall 1994. They received $3.8 million of investment from venture capital firms in November of that year. In 1995, the company started publishing their own games under their own label starting with &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; (1995). Designed by Seamus Blackley, the game was noted for its realistic physics simulation and was very successful for Looking Glass, selling 300,000 copies by mid-1997. The series was followed up by several sequels/

&quot;Terra Nova: Strike Force Centuri&quot; (1996) was a large multimedia production by the studio. The full-motion cutscenes were shot inside of the Looking Glass offices on a greenscreen, with staff members doubling as actors and producers of the film. The game featured other technological achievements like procedural animation, but the massive production took its toll on Looking Glass, not recouping its production costs.

=== Looking Glass Studios (1997-2000) ===
Due in part to the failure of &quot;Terra Nova&quot; and &quot;British Open Championship Golf&quot; (1997), Neurath sought outside investment to keep the company afloat. Intermetrics, a Massachusetts-based software company, acquired LookingGlass in 1997. The official name of the company was changed to Intermetrics Entertainment Software, LLC, operating under the trade name of Looking Glass Studios.

The Intermetrics buyout preceded a number of departures at the studio. Co-founder Ned Lerner left to form Multitude with Looking Glass programmer Art Min. Most famously, designer Ken Levine, artist Rob Fermier, and programmer Jonathan Chey who had worked together on a &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; game canceled in production formed Irrational Games. Irrational formed a studio initially based in the Looking Glass offices, where they co-developed &quot;System Shock 2&quot; (1999) and the canceled &quot;Deep Cover&quot; before becoming fully independent.

During the production of &quot;&quot; (1998), Looking Glass hired Warren Spector away from Origin Systems to staff a development arm of the company in Austin, Texas first opened in 1995. Though Spector left soon afterwards to join Ion Storm, the Texas office remained open to create console games for various publishers. They created a port of &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot; for the Nintendo 64, &quot;Destruction Derby 64&quot; (1999), along with canceled projects &quot;Tamiya Racing&quot; and &quot;Mini Racers&quot;.

The lack of success for Looking Glass&#x27; projects continued to exert pressure on the studio, in addition to their difficulties finding publishers. Eidos Interactive published &quot;Flight Unlimited II&quot; (1997) and both &quot;Thief&quot; games, Electronic Arts published &quot;System Shock 2&quot; and &quot;Flight Unlimited III&quot; (1999). In 1999, Intermetrics divested their ownership of Looking Glass, leaving them without any financial support. The following year, several publishing deals with Eidos, Sony, and Microsoft fell apart.

On May 24, 2000, Neurath called a meeting attended by all employees. He announced that the studio was closing down and the staff left the building that day, with public announcements following. Irrational Games continued work on &quot;Deep Cover&quot; until its subsequent cancellation; many former Looking Glass staff like Terri Brosius joined them. Development on &quot;Thief III&quot; was handed to a team led by &quot;Thief II&quot; project lead Steve Pearsall until it was canceled. A &quot;Flight Unlimited&quot; spin-off, &quot;Flight Combat&quot;, which was an estimated three months from completion, was handed to Mad Doc Software to be completed as &quot;Jane&#x27;s Attack Squadron&quot; (2002) as the final game with credits by Looking Glass Studios.

=== Legacy ===
Looking Glass Studios has been called one of the most important development studios in the history of video games. Their game catalog including the &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot;, &quot;System Shock&quot;, and &quot;Thief&quot; series are seen as the foundation for the immersive sim genre of action games. Games like &quot;The Elder Scrolls: Arena&quot;, &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, and &quot;Dishonored&quot; are explicitly modeled after Looking Glass&#x27; catalog. The latter two feature designers who were formerly members of Looking Glass.

&quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; was an influence on id Software&#x27;s move to create visually impressive first person shooters. John Romero, who had worked on &quot;Space Rogue&quot;, conversed with Paul Neurath about the texture mapping technology used in the early Underworld demo. He spoke about this to John Carmack, who implemented the technique into &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot; (1991). This technology was crucial to the creation of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; (1992) and &quot;Doom&quot; (1993). 

Many other of Looking Glass&#x27; developers went on to work on important AAA games. Ned Lerner joined Sony Worldwide Studios as Director of Engineering where he worked on games through the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. Seamus Blackley and other Looking Glass cohorts left to join Dreamworks Interactive, working on the innovative &quot;Trespasser&quot; (1998). AI programmer on &quot;Thief: The Dark Project&quot; Tom Leonard joined Valve Corporation where he developed the AI for Source projects including &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. Doug Church went on to work for Ion Storm, Electronic Arts, and eventually Valve. Greg LoPiccolo and Eric Brosius joined Harmonix where they played a major role in the development of the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; franchises.

Following the closure of Looking Glass, Paul Neurath founded Floodgate Entertainment in Boston, Massachusetts. They ported &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; to mobile platforms as well as worked on titles like &quot;Dark Messiah of Might and Magic&quot;. Floodgate was later acquired by Zynga and merged into the Zynga Boston studio; Neurath became the creative director. After the closure of Zynga Boston in October 2012, Neurath established Otherside Entertainment in 2013. He reassembled many Looking Glass employees to work on a spiritual successor of &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot;, &quot;Underworld Ascendant&quot; (2018), initially funded through Kickstarter.

The rights to Looking Glass&#x27; catalog were initially split between various rights holders, which made re-releases of their catalog difficult. Eidos retained the rights to the &quot;Thief&quot; franchise. &quot;&quot; (2004) was created by Ion Storm and the reboot &quot;Thief&quot; (2014) was created by Eidos-Montréal. Stephen Kick of Nightdive Studios secured the rights to re-release the &quot;System Shock&quot; games and eventually acquired the IP rights to create a remake, &quot;System Shock&quot; (2023), and a future sequel.

<text>In optics, any optical instrument or systema microscope, telescope, or camerahas a principal limit to its resolution due to the physics of diffraction. An optical instrument is said to be diffraction-limited if it has reached this limit of resolution performance. Other factors may affect an optical system&#x27;s performance, such as lens imperfections or aberrations, but these are caused by errors in the manufacture or calculation of a lens, whereas the diffraction limit is the maximum resolution possible for a theoretically perfect, or ideal, optical system.

The diffraction-limited angular resolution, in radians, of an instrument is proportional to the wavelength of the light being observed, and inversely proportional to the diameter of its objective&#x27;s entrance aperture. For telescopes with circular apertures, the size of the smallest feature in an image that is diffraction limited is the size of the Airy disk. As one decreases the size of the aperture of a telescopic lens, diffraction proportionately increases. At small apertures, such as f/22, most modern lenses are limited only by diffraction and not by aberrations or other imperfections in the construction.

For microscopic instruments, the diffraction-limited spatial resolution is proportional to the light wavelength, and to the numerical aperture of either the objective or the object illumination source, whichever is smaller.

In astronomy, a diffraction-limited observation is one that achieves the resolution of a theoretically ideal objective in the size of instrument used. However, most observations from Earth are seeing-limited due to atmospheric effects. Optical telescopes on the Earth work at a much lower resolution than the diffraction limit because of the distortion introduced by the passage of light through several kilometres of turbulent atmosphere. Advanced observatories have started using adaptive optics technology, resulting in greater image resolution for faint targets, but it is still difficult to reach the diffraction limit using adaptive optics.

Radio telescopes are frequently diffraction-limited, because the wavelengths they use (from millimeters to meters) are so long that the atmospheric distortion is negligible. Space-based telescopes (such as Hubble, or a number of non-optical telescopes) always work at their diffraction limit, if their design is free of optical aberration.

The beam from a laser with near-ideal beam propagation properties may be described as being diffraction-limited. A diffraction-limited laser beam, passed through diffraction-limited optics, will remain diffraction-limited, and will have a spatial or angular extent essentially equal to the resolution of the optics at the wavelength of the laser.

==Calculation of diffraction limit==

===The Abbe diffraction limit for a microscope===
The observation of sub-wavelength structures with microscopes is difficult because of the Abbe diffraction limit. Ernst Abbe found in 1873, and expressed as a formula in 1882, that light with wavelength formula_1, traveling in a medium with refractive index formula_2 and converging to a spot with half-angle formula_3 will have a minimum resolvable distance of
:formula_4

The portion of the denominator formula_5 is called the numerical aperture (NA) and can reach about 1.4–1.6 in modern optics, hence the Abbe limit is formula_6.
The same formula had been proven by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1874.

Considering green light around 500 nm and a NA of 1, the Abbe limit is roughly formula_7 (0.25 μm), which is small compared to most biological cells (1 μm to 100 μm), but large compared to viruses (100 nm), proteins (10 nm) and less complex molecules (1 nm). To increase the resolution, shorter wavelengths can be used such as UV and X-ray microscopes. These techniques offer better resolution but are expensive, suffer from lack of contrast in biological samples and may damage the sample.

===Digital photography===

In a digital camera, diffraction effects interact with the effects of the regular pixel grid. The combined effect of the different parts of an optical system is determined by the convolution of the point spread functions (PSF). The point spread function of a diffraction limited circular-aperture lens is simply the Airy disk. The point spread function of the camera, otherwise called the instrument response function (IRF) can be approximated by a rectangle function, with a width equivalent to the pixel pitch. A more complete derivation of the modulation transfer function (derived from the PSF) of image sensors is given by Fliegel. Whatever the exact instrument response function, it is largely independent of the f-number of the lens. Thus at different f-numbers a camera may operate in three different regimes, as follows:

# In the case where the spread of the IRF is small with respect to the spread of the diffraction PSF, in which case the system may be said to be essentially diffraction limited (so long as the lens itself is diffraction limited).
# In the case where the spread of the diffraction PSF is small with respect to the IRF, in which case the system is instrument limited.
# In the case where the spread of the PSF and IRF are similar, in which case both impact the available resolution of the system.

The spread of the diffraction-limited PSF is approximated by the diameter of the first null of the Airy disk,

:formula_8

where formula_1 is the wavelength of the light and formula_10 is the f-number of the imaging optics, i.e., formula_11 in the Abbe diffraction limit formula. For instance, for an f/8 lens (formula_12 and formula_13 ) and for green light (formula_14 0.5 μm wavelength) light, the focusing spot diameter will be d = 9.76 μm or 19.5formula_15. This is similar to the pixel size for the majority of commercially available &#x27;full frame&#x27; (43mm sensor diagonal) cameras and so these will operate in regime 3 for f-numbers around 8 (few lenses are close to diffraction limited at f-numbers smaller than 8). Cameras with smaller sensors will tend to have smaller pixels, but their lenses will be designed for use at smaller f-numbers and it is likely that they will also operate in regime 3 for those f-numbers for which their lenses are diffraction limited.

==Obtaining higher resolution==

There are techniques for producing images that appear to have higher resolution than allowed by simple use of diffraction-limited optics. Although these techniques improve some aspect of resolution, they generally come at an enormous increase in cost and complexity. Usually the technique is only appropriate for a small subset of imaging problems, with several general approaches outlined below.

===Extending numerical aperture===

The effective resolution of a microscope can be improved by illuminating from the side. 

In conventional microscopes such as bright-field or differential interference contrast, this is achieved by using a condenser. Under spatially incoherent conditions, the image is understood as a composite of images illuminated from each point on the condenser, each of which covers a different portion of the object&#x27;s spatial frequencies. This effectively improves the resolution by, at most, a factor of two. 

Simultaneously illuminating from all angles (fully open condenser) drives down interferometric contrast. In conventional microscopes, the maximum resolution (fully open condenser, at N = 1) is rarely used. Further, under partially coherent conditions, the recorded image is often non-linear with object&#x27;s scattering potential—especially when looking at non-self-luminous (non-fluorescent) objects. To boost contrast, and sometimes to linearize the system, unconventional microscopes (with structured illumination) synthesize the condenser illumination by acquiring a sequence of images with known illumination parameters. Typically, these images are composited to form a single image with data covering a larger portion of the object&#x27;s spatial frequencies when compared to using a fully closed condenser (which is also rarely used).

Another technique, 4Pi microscopy, uses two opposing objectives to double the effective numerical aperture, effectively halving the diffraction limit, by collecting the forward and backward scattered light. When imaging a transparent sample, with a combination of incoherent or structured illumination, as well as collecting both forward, and backward scattered light it is possible to image the complete scattering sphere.

Unlike methods relying on localization, such systems are still limited by the diffraction limit of the illumination (condenser) and collection optics (objective), although in practice they can provide substantial resolution improvements compared to conventional methods.

===Near-field techniques===

The diffraction limit is only valid in the far field as it assumes that no evanescent fields reach the detector. Various near-field techniques that operate less than ≈1 wavelength of light away from the image plane can obtain substantially higher resolution. These techniques exploit the fact that the evanescent field contains information beyond the diffraction limit which can be used to construct very high resolution images, in principle beating the diffraction limit by a factor proportional to how well a specific imaging system can detect the near-field signal. For scattered light imaging, instruments such as near-field scanning optical microscopes and nano-FTIR, which are built atop atomic force microscope systems, can be used to achieve up to 10-50 nm resolution. The data recorded by such instruments often requires substantial processing, essentially solving an optical inverse problem for each image.

Metamaterial-based superlenses can image with a resolution better than the diffraction limit by locating the objective lens extremely close (typically hundreds of nanometers) to the object.

In fluorescence microscopy the excitation and emission are typically on different wavelengths. In total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy a thin portion of the sample located immediately on the cover glass is excited with an evanescent field, and recorded with a conventional diffraction-limited objective, improving the axial resolution.

However, because these techniques cannot image beyond 1 wavelength, they cannot be used to image into objects thicker than 1 wavelength which limits their applicability.

===Far-field techniques===

Far-field imaging techniques are most desirable for imaging objects that are large compared to the illumination wavelength but that contain fine structure. This includes nearly all biological applications in which cells span multiple wavelengths but contain structure down to molecular scales. In recent years several techniques have shown that sub-diffraction limited imaging is possible over macroscopic distances. These techniques usually exploit optical nonlinearity in a material&#x27;s reflected light to generate resolution beyond the diffraction limit.

Among these techniques, the STED microscope has been one of the most successful. In STED, multiple laser beams are used to first excite, and then quench fluorescent dyes. The nonlinear response to illumination caused by the quenching process in which adding more light causes the image to become less bright generates sub-diffraction limited information about the location of dye molecules, allowing resolution far beyond the diffraction limit provided high illumination intensities are used.

==Laser beams==

The limits on focusing or collimating a laser beam are very similar to the limits on imaging with a microscope or telescope. The only difference is that laser beams are typically soft-edged beams. This non-uniformity in light distribution leads to a coefficient slightly different from the 1.22 value familiar in imaging. However, the scaling with wavelength and aperture is exactly the same.

The beam quality of a laser beam is characterized by how well its propagation matches an ideal Gaussian beam at the same wavelength. The beam quality factor M squared (M2) is found by measuring the size of the beam at its waist, and its divergence far from the waist, and taking the product of the two, known as the beam parameter product. The ratio of this measured beam parameter product to that of the ideal is defined as M2, so that M2=1 describes an ideal beam. The M2 value of a beam is conserved when it is transformed by diffraction-limited optics.

The outputs of many low and moderately powered lasers have M2 values of 1.2 or less, and are essentially diffraction-limited.

==Other waves==
The same equations apply to other wave-based sensors, such as radar and the human ear.

As opposed to light waves (i.e., photons), massive particles have a different relationship between their quantum mechanical wavelength and their energy. This relationship indicates that the effective &quot;de Broglie&quot; wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum of the particle. For example, an electron at an energy of 10 keV has a wavelength of 0.01 nm, allowing the electron microscope (SEM or TEM) to achieve high resolution images. Other massive particles such as helium, neon, and gallium ions have been used to produce images at resolutions beyond what can be attained with visible light. Such instruments provide nanometer scale imaging, analysis and fabrication capabilities at the expense of system complexity.

<text>HM Customs and Excise (properly known as Her Majesty&#x27;s Customs and Excise at the time of its dissolution) was a department of the British Government formed in 1909 by the merger of HM Customs and HM Excise; its primary responsibility was the collection of customs duties, excise duties, and other indirect taxes.

The payment of customs dues has been recorded in Britain for over one thousand years and HMCE was formed from predecessor bodies with a long history.

With effect from 18 April 2005, HMCE merged with the Inland Revenue (which was responsible for the administration and collection of direct taxes) to form a new department: HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

==Activities==
The three main functions of HMCE were revenue collection, assessment and preventive work, alongside which other duties were performed.

===Revenue collection===
On behalf of HM Treasury, officers of HM Customs and Excise levied customs duties, excise duties, and other indirect taxes (such as Air Passenger Duty, Climate Change Levy, Insurance Premium Tax, Landfill Tax, Purchase Tax and Value-added tax (VAT)).

===Assessment===
Officers spent significant amounts of time in docks, warehouses and depots and on board newly arrived ships assessing dutiable goods and cargoes. Specialist tools were provided e.g. for the measurement of containers or the specific gravity of alcohol.

===Preventive work===
HMCE was responsible for managing the import and export of goods and services into the UK; as such, its officers were active in the detection and prevention of attempts to evade the revenue laws, for example through smuggling or illicit distillation of alcohol. Since the early 17th century, the searching of vessels for illicit goods when undertaken by customs officers has been called &#x27;rummaging&#x27;.

===Other===
For various reasons HMCE and its predecessors had accrued a variety of other responsibilities over the years, some of which had nothing to do with revenue collection and protection. Many of these additional duties pertained to the regulation of activities in UK coastal waters on behalf of HM Government (not least because HMCE had customs officers stationed all around the UK coast). Thus at various times in the 20th century HMCE was involved in receiving, regulating or recording:
* import and export licences
* trade statistics (since 1696)
* light dues (recorded since 1615)
* wrecks (statutory by 1713)
* embargoes 
* quarantine and other public health restrictions (since 1663)
* occupational licensing
* registration of moneylenders
* exchange controls
* ship registration
* immigration control (in smaller ports and airports)

==Location==

In the 1970s Customs &amp; Excise officers were operating from around 2,000 offices located in all parts of the United Kingdom; they ranged in size from large regional centres to small outposts attached to distilleries and the like.

Historically, the Board of Customs and the Board of Excise were (along with the General Post Office) &#x27;the only Crown Services organised on a country-wide basis&#x27;. Custom houses were to be found in all major ports of entry (as well as some smaller harbours). Excise Offices were located both around the coast and inland (in former centuries, every market town in England had a designated Excise Office, albeit not permanently staffed; often a room in a local inn would be adapted for the purpose when required).

The nation&#x27;s borders were the prime location for much of HMCE&#x27;s work. Before the 20th century the UK&#x27;s only border was its coastline and customs activity was focused around the coast. The establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922 gave the United Kingdom a land border, which also required customs checkpoints; later, customs officers were needed at airports as well. As well as administering Customs declarations, HM Customs and Excise staff had responsibility for guarding the borders of the United Kingdom from smugglers. To try to achieve this, HMCE and its predecessors had a history of operating both on land and at sea.

===Headquarters===

The historic headquarters of HM Customs was the Custom House on Lower Thames Street in the City of London. This went on to become the headquarters of HMCE when the Excise head office moved there from Somerset House in 1909. Later, however, the Commissioners along with most of the headquarters staff were forced to move out after the building was damaged in a bombing raid in December 1940. They moved initially to Finsbury Square, then in 1952 to the newly built &quot;King&#x27;s Beam House&quot; in Mark Lane. (The damaged section of London&#x27;s Custom House was later rebuilt and the building remained in use by HM Revenue and Customs until 2021.) In 1987 the headquarters staff moved again to &quot;New King&#x27;s Beam House&quot; 22 Upper Ground London SE1 in the area of Southwark.

==Corporate structure==
The 1909 amalgamation of the (previously separate) Customs and Excise services required a new corporate structure, which substantially remained in place until 1971. The new Board of Customs and Excise had oversight of three inter-linked branches, each with its own management structure:
* The Headquarters staff (based in London)
* The Outdoor Service (based at Customs and Excise Offices all around the country)
* The Waterguard (uniformed preventive service: based at coastal locations, airports and border crossings).

The &quot;Board of Customs and Excise&quot; was made up of eight Commissioners appointed by Letters Patent under the Great Seal and chaired by a Permanent Secretary. The Board was responsible to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for collecting and accounting for all customs and excise revenues and for &#x27;the management of all matters belonging and incidental to such collection&#x27;.

The &quot;Headquarters Staff&quot; had oversight of policy implementation and management, as well as providing central accounting, legal and administrative services; its operation was akin to that of a government department.

The &quot;Outdoor Service&quot; was divided into geographical areas called Collections, each overseen by a Collector (a senior official who acted as the Board&#x27;s representative). Initially there were ninety-two Collections (formed by merging the previously separate Customs Collections and Excise Collections) but these were later reduced: to thirty-nine by 1930, twenty-nine by 1971. The Collections were subdivided into Districts (each overseen by a Surveyor) within which were several Stations, each staffed by one or more Officers of Customs and Excise. In each Collection, the Stations were responsible for assessment of duty while the Collector&#x27;s Office focused on collection of revenue.

The &quot;Waterguard&quot; carried out preventive work; it worked closely alongside the Outdoor Service but was separately constituted with its own management structure and its own geographical &#x27;Divisions&#x27;.

After 1971, management structures were streamlined and unified, with Civil Service grades replacing the previous disparate ranking structures in most areas. At the same time the Waterguard ceased to operate as a separate body, although uniformed customs officers continued to be involved in preventive work.

===Personnel===

The majority of the Headquarters staff belonged to the Civil Service grades (generally clerical, executive, and secretariat).

The main grades in the outfield were: clerical staff, Officer of C&amp;E, Allowanced Officer of C&amp;E (the allowance was for taking on certain administrative duties e.g. rostering), Surveyor of C&amp;E – all of which were at &#x27;district&#x27; level and then Assistant Collector, Deputy Collector and Collector (regional management). The regions of London Port and Liverpool (later &#x27;London Airports&#x27; was added) were graded as slightly higher than the others. All grades were amalgamated and incorporated into the general Civil Service grades in 1971.

Established in the mid-twentieth century to combat fraud and drug smuggling, the Investigation Division was headed by a Chief Investigation Officer, equivalent in rank to a Collector, assisted by a Deputy Chief Investigation Officer and a number of Assistant Chief Investigation Officers. Each team of, usually, six was headed by a Senior Investigation Officer (equivalent to a Surveyor or SEO) and consisted of a mix of Investigation Officers and Higher Investigation Officers.

Officers of the Waterguard had their own rank structure, namely: Assistant Preventive Officer (APO), Preventive Officer (PO) and Chief Preventive Officer (CPO); all these routinely wore uniform (see below). Higher grades were the Assistant Superintendent and Superintendent, neither of whom wore a uniform. After 1971 the Waterguard was renamed the Preventive Service and integrated into the main structure of HMCE. POs were renamed &quot;Executive Officers (Preventive)&quot; and APOs &quot;Assistant Officers (Preventive)&quot;.

Customs &amp; Excise officers had authority throughout the country, including the powers of entry to premises and of arrest (though at times requiring the presence of a police constable).

HMCE had an overall headcount of 23,000 staff in 2004 before the merger with Inland revenue.

====Uniform====

The uniform worn by officers of the Waterguard was identical to Royal Navy officers’ uniform with the exception of the cap badge (a crowned portcullis with flying chains), buttons (a crown rather than the fouled anchor) and the cuff rank lace (which only extended halfway round the cuff, rather than full cuff as in the Royal Navy (this possibly believed to be a WWII cost-cutting measure)).

Prior to 1946, Chief Preventive Officers (CPO) wore two and a half gold stripes on their uniform while Preventive Officers (PO) had one stripe and Assistant Preventive Officers (APO) no stripe. After that date CPOs wore three stripes, POs two stripes and APOs one stripe. All uniformed grades wore a Navy curl; CPOs were further distinguished by having a row of gold oak leaves on the peak of the cap.

After 1971 the same uniform was adopted by uniformed officers of the Preventive Service.

==Corporate history==
The Board of Customs, responsible for collecting duties levied on imported goods, and the Board of Excise, responsible for raising revenue from inland taxes, were both established in the 17th century. The raising of excise duties also dates from this time, but the levying of customs duties has a far longer history, the first written reference being found in an eighth-century charter of King Aethelbald.

Following the 1707 Act of Union a separate Scottish Board of Customs and Scottish Excise Board were constituted; a century later separate boards were likewise established for Ireland. By an Act of Parliament dated 2 May 1823, these and the English Boards were consolidated to form a single Board of Excise and a single Board of Customs for the whole United Kingdom.

These boards (and their successors) were made up of commissioners, appointed under the Great Seal of the Realm.

===HM Customs===
Originally, the term &quot;customs&quot; meant any customary payments or dues of any kind (for example, to the king, or a bishop, or the church), but later became restricted to duties payable to the king on the import or export of goods. A centralised English customs system can be traced to the Winchester Assize of Customs of 1203, in the reign of King John, from which time customs were to be collected and paid to the State Treasury. HM Customs was established on a more permanent basis with the passing of legislation in the reign of King Edward I: the &quot;nova custuma&quot; of 1275. Alongside the &quot;nova custuma&quot; (which was levied on exported wool and leather) duty was levied on imported goods; from the 14th century this became known as tonnage and poundage.

====The Board of Customs====
A Board of Customs was effectively created by the Long Parliament on 21 January 1643 under the &quot;Ordinance concerning the Customs for the continuance of the ordinance of concerning the subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage from 1 March 1643, to 25 March 1644&quot;. Under this act the regulation of the collection of customs was entrusted to a parliamentary committee; however in 1662 Parliament reverted to the farming system, until a permanent Board was finally established in 1671.

===HM Revenue of Excise===

His or Her Majesty&#x27;s Excise duties are inland duties levied on articles at the time of their manufacture, such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco. Excise duties were first levied in England in 1643, during the Commonwealth (initially on beer, cider, spirits and soap); later, duties were levied on such diverse commodities as salt, paper and bricks.

For a time, the Excise Board was also responsible for collecting the duty levied on imports of beverages such as rum, brandy and other spirits, as well as tea, coffee, chocolate and cocoa beans. Prior to payment of duty, these items were often stored in a bonded warehouse, where excise officers could assess and measure them.

====The Board of Excise====
A Board of Excise was likewise established by the Long Parliament under the &quot;Excise Ordinance&quot; of 1643 (&quot;Ordinance for the speedy raising and levying of moneys by way of charge or impost upon several commodities&quot;). After 1662 Excise revenue was farmed for the most part, until the Board was established on a permanent footing in 1683.

====The Board of Inland Revenue====
In 1849 the Board of Excise was merged with the Board of Stamps and Taxes to create a new Board of Inland Revenue.

===HM Customs and Excise===
The combined Board of Customs and Excise was formed in 1909 by the transfer of responsibility for Excise from the Board of Inland Revenue to the Board of Customs.

===HM Revenue and Customs===
HM Customs and Excise was not responsible for collecting direct taxes: that was the job of the Inland Revenue. In March 2004, the O&#x27;Donnell review called for the merger of Customs and Excise with Inland Revenue; in the 2004 Budget, Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that the merger would go ahead, and the merged body (HM Revenue and Customs) was implemented by the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005.

==Border enforcement==
For centuries, combatting smuggling had been part of the job of revenue officers. In the late 17th century, a concerted effort was made to combat this growing problem; land-based Riding Officers were employed to patrol the coast on horseback, while Revenue cutters were provided to enable officers to intercept vessels involved in smuggling at sea.

===The Waterguard===

In 1809 an organisation called the Preventive Water Guard was formed, independent of HM Customs, as a specialist service to combat smuggling. In 1822 it was brought together with the Riding Officers and Cutter service to form a new body (under the authority of HM Customs) named the Coast Guard. In 1856, however, authority over the Coast Guard was transferred from the Customs to the Admiralty.

In 1891 a specialist Waterguard service was re-established within HM Customs, dedicated to rummaging vessels and combatting smuggling.

===The Cutter Service===
Following the transfer of the Coastguard to the Admiralty, HM Customs had found itself bereft of sea-going vessels. For the first part of the twentieth century, HMCE made do with a single revenue cruiser, the &quot;Vigilant&quot; (which served more as a flagship for the Commissioners than as a practical deterrent). After the Second World War, however, the need for active vessels was again recognised and suitable craft were purchased from the Admiralty. By 1962 HMCE had four fast launches in service, crewed by officers of the Waterguard (many of whom had seen active service in the Royal Navy); by 1980 eight further vessels had been acquired.

In the 21st century, a fleet of Customs Cutters (latterly 42 metre Damen patrol vessels) continued to operate throughout UK territorial waters inspecting vessels for Prohibited and restricted goods and increasingly immigration matters

===After the 2005 merger===
In 2005, the border enforcement functions of HMCE were transferred (along with the organisation responsible for them) to HMRC; but in 2008 they were again transferred (at least in part) to the new UK Border Agency of the Home Office, which due to various failings was itself disbanded in 2012, whereupon a new UK Border Force was established with border enforcement responsibilities and powers.

==Notable Customs and Excise officers==
Historically, some of the more well-known figures to have served as Customs officers or Excise men are Robert Burns, Geoffrey Chaucer, William Congreve, Daniel Defoe, John Dryden, Thomas Paine and Adam Smith. Other literary figures included William Allingham, John Oldmixon, Matthew Prior and Maurice Walsh. A number of senior officers in London went on to serve as Lord Mayor, including Sir Nicholas Brembre, Sir William Walworth and Sir Richard (&#x27;Dick&#x27;) Whittington.

<text>Quebec nationalism or Québécois nationalism is a feeling and a political doctrine that prioritizes cultural belonging to, the defense of the interests of, and the recognition of the political legitimacy of the Québécois nation. It has been a movement and a central issue in Quebec politics since the beginning of the 19th century. Québécois nationalism has seen several political, ideological and partisan variations and incarnations over the years.

Quebec nationalism plays a central role in the political movement for the independence of Quebec from Canada. Several groups and political parties claim to be Québécois nationalists. The autonomist political parties, which do not want the sovereignty of Quebec but the expansion of its powers and the defence of its specificity within Canada, such as the Coalition Avenir Québec, also claim to be Québécois nationalists.

Quebec nationalism was first known as &quot;French Canadian nationalism&quot;. The term was replaced by &quot;Québécois nationalism&quot; during the Quiet Revolution.

== liberal nationalism==

=== New France ===
The settlement of New France was made up of 7 regions that spanned from the Maritimes to the Rockies and from the Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. Although this landscape was vast, most efforts were made to colonize what is now present-day Canada. After the 17th century, the newly arrived French settlers adapted to the terrain of New France. Over time, these settlers developed a regional Canadian identity. This could be seen in the developing of new accents, creation of new legends and stories, emerging societal traits and the use of the French language. The latter originated with the loss of the settlers&#x27; langue d&#x27;oïls and the adoption of standard French, which came to be used by the educated classes of the colony. It further developed from the levelling of many langues d&#x27;oïl which led to the creation of a local accent.

During this time, the newly arrived immigrants were no longer seen as immigrants but rather people who embodied not only a Canadian identity but also a provincial identity as well. Moreover, this was complemented by the fact that 95% of the colonists were Francophones, while the remaining people were English-speaking. However, this would prove to create contention later on.

===1534–1774===

Canada was first a French colony. Jacques Cartier claimed it for France in 1534, and permanent French settlement began in 1608. It was part of New France, which constituted all French colonies in North America. Up until 1760, nationalism had developed itself free of all external influences. However, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the British invaded New France as part of the French and Indian War, winning a conclusive victory at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. At the Treaty of Paris, France agreed to abandon its claims over New France in return for the island of Guadeloupe. From the 1760s onward, nationalism developed within a British constitutional context. Despite intense pressure from outside Parliament, the British government drafted the Quebec Act which guaranteed the restoration of French civil law; guaranteed the free practice of the Catholic faith; and returned the territorial extensions that they had enjoyed before the Treaty of Paris. In effect, this &quot;enlightened&quot; action by leaders in the British Parliament allowed French Canada to retain its unique characteristics. Although detrimental to Britain&#x27;s relationship with the Thirteen Colonies, this has, in its contemporary assessment, been viewed as an act of appeasement and was largely effective at dissolving nationalism in the 18th century (especially considering the threat and proximity of American revolutionary ideology) yet it became less effective with the arrival of Loyalists after the revolutions. With the Loyalists splitting the province of Quebec into two identities; Upper Canada and Lower Canada, were labelled by the Loyalists as French Canadians.

===1800s–1880s===

From 1776 to the late 1830s, the world witnessed the creation of many new national states with the birth of the United States, the French Republic, Haiti, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Gran Colombia, Belgium, Greece and others. Often accomplished militarily, these national independence movements occurred in the context of complex ideological and political struggles pitting European metropoles against their respective colonies, often assuming the dichotomy of monarchists against republicans. These battles succeeded in creating independent republican states in some regions of the world, but they failed in other places, such as Ireland, Upper Canada, Lower Canada, and Germany.

There is no consensus on the exact time of the birth of a national consciousness in French Canada. Some historians defend the thesis that it existed before the 19th century, because the saw themselves as a people culturally distinct from the French even in the time of New France. The cultural tensions were indeed palpable between the governor of New France, the Canadian-born Pierre de Vaudreuil and General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, a Frenchman, during the French and Indian War. However, the use of the expression (the Canadian nation) by French Canadians started being used in the 19th century. The idea of a was supported by the liberal or professional class in Lower Canada: lawyers, notaries, librarians, accountants, doctors, journalists, and architects, among others.

A political movement for the independence of the people slowly took form following the enactment of the Constitutional Act of 1791. This act of the British Parliament created two colonies, Lower Canada and Upper Canada, each of which had its own political institutions. In Lower Canada, the French-speaking and Catholic held the majority in the elected legislative assembly, but were either a small minority or simply not represented in the appointed legislative and executive councils, both appointed by the governor, representing the British Crown in the colony. Most of the members of the legislative council and the executive council were part of the British ruling class, composed of wealthy merchants, judges, militia officers and other members of the elite supportive of the Tory party. From early 1800 to 1837, the government and the elected assembly were at odds on virtually every issue.

Under the leadership of Speaker Louis-Joseph Papineau, the (renamed in 1826) initiated a movement of reform of the political institutions of Lower Canada. The party&#x27;s constitutional policy, summed up in the Ninety-Two Resolutions of 1834, called for the election of the legislative and executive councils.

The movement of reform gathered the support of the majority of the representatives of the people among francophones but also among liberal anglophones. A number of the prominent characters in the reformist movement were of British descent, for example John Neilson, Wolfred Nelson, Robert Nelson and Thomas Storrow Brown or of Irish extraction, Edmund Bailey O&#x27;Callaghan, Daniel Tracey and Jocquelin Waller.

Two currents existed within the reformists of the : a moderate wing, whose members were fond of British institutions and wished for Lower Canada to have a government more accountable to the elective house&#x27;s representative and a more radical wing whose attachment to British institutions was rather conditional to this proving to be as good as to those of the neighbouring American republics.

The formal rejection of all 92 resolutions by the Cabinet of the United Kingdom in 1837 led to a radicalization of the patriotic movement&#x27;s actions. Louis-Joseph Papineau took the leadership of a new strategy which included the boycott of all British imports. During the summer, many popular gatherings () were organized to protest against the policy of Great Britain in Lower Canada. In November, Governor Archibald Acheson ordered the arrest of 26 leaders of the movement, among whom Louis-Joseph Papineau and many other reformists were members of parliament. This instigated an armed conflict which developed into the Lower Canada Rebellion.

Following the repression of the insurrectionist movement of 1838, many of the most revolutionary nationalist and democratic ideas of the were discredited.

==Ultramontane nationalism==

===1840s–1950s===

Although it was still defended and promoted up until the beginning of the 20th century, the French-Canadian liberal nationalism born out of the American and French revolutions began to decline in the 1840s, gradually being replaced by both a more moderate liberal nationalism and the ultramontanism of the powerful Catholic clergy as epitomized by Lionel Groulx.

In opposition with the other nationalists, ultramontanes rejected the rising democratic ideal that the people are sovereign and that the Church should have limited influence in governance. To protect the power of the Church and prevent the rise of democracy and the separation of church-and-state, Lionel Groulx and other intellectuals engaged in nationalistic &#x27;myth-making&#x27; or propaganda, to build a nationalistic French-Canadian identity, in purpose to protect the power of the Church and dissuade the public from popular-rule and secularist views. Groulx propagated French-Canadian nationalism and argued that maintaining a Roman Catholic Quebec was the only means to &#x27;emancipate the nation against English power.&#x27; He believed the powers of the provincial government of Quebec could and should be used within Confederation, to bolster provincial autonomy (and thus Church power), and advocated it would benefit the French-Canadian nation economically, socially, culturally and linguistically. Groulx successfully promoted Québécois nationalism and the ultra-conservative Catholic social doctrine, to which the Church would maintain dominance in political and social life in Quebec. In the 1920s–1950s, this form of traditionalist Catholic nationalism became known as clerico-nationalism.

=== 1950s ===
In the time leading up to the radical changes of the Quiet Revolution the people of Quebec placed more importance on traditional values in life which included going back to their nationalistic roots.

Nationalism at this time meant restoring the old regime and going back to the concept of a French-Canadian nation built upon Catholicism as it was in the past. The church and state were intertwined and the church greatly dictated legislature falling under the matters of the state.

Nationalism also represented conservation, and in that, not being influenced by the outside world but rather staying within their own borders without room for exploration. Quebec was very closed minded wanting to keep their people and province untouched by the more progressive ideas from the rest of the world. Even in terms of careers, the church governed the state in this aspect and people were working conventional jobs such as in the agricultural industry.

Quebec did not align with the fast-paced urban life of Western society that was reflected across the nation and other countries. The lack of great progression is believed to be attributed to the premier of the province at this time Maurice Duplessis.

Maurice Duplessis returned to win the 1944 election and stayed in the position of premier of Quebec for fifteen years whilst being the leader of the conservative Union Nationale party. The Union Nationale party valued and upheld the traditional definition of nationalism. This meant the province would upkeep its long-established ways of operating with changes being made only within the scope of the conventional values. Because of this, the Union Nationale party was favored by those who wanted to stick to the accustomed lifestyle and disliked by those who wanted a progressive province being brought into the North American culture.
Duplessis&#x27;s main ideas to transform Quebec were through rapid industrialization, urbanization and a greater and faster development of the province&#x27;s natural resources. English speakers of the province hoped that industrialization and urbanization would replace the outdated French Canadian society. These changes launched French Canadians into the urban and industrial way of life. There were new opportunities created to provide economic and social stability but by doing so, decreased the importance and significance placed upon cultural and linguistic survival.

However, the deaths of Maurice Duplessis in September 1959 and his successor Paul Sauve in January 1960 set in motion the final end to the old traditional definition of Quebec nationalism in the 1950s. A new leader, Quebec and ideology of nationalism would emerge and sweep across the province finally providing French-Canadians their greatly awaited need for change.

=== 1960s ===
The events leading up to the 1960s were catalysts that would tear down and reconstruct the foundation of what it meant to be a Quebec Nationalist.

Nationalism in the 1960s represented a completely new mantra unlike the aged significance placed upon it in the 1950s. The 1960s in Quebec was a period of the Quiet Revolution, the Liberal Party of Canada the election of the Parti Québécois, a site of a thriving economy and the beginning of a variety of independent movements. During this time, Quebec was a place of enlightenment, there were changes in the society, values, and economy. This was a time of radical thinking, culture and ideologies, one ideology would finally emerge after centuries of dormancy. Quebec would change from its old fashioned roots and be brought into the progressive mainstream century.

A main difference was the secularization of the Catholic Church, practiced by most French Canadians from the province itself. Unlike in the 1950s under Duplessis, the church and state were now separate entities removing the strict control the old fashioned ways of the church had over institutions. The shift gained the province its own independence.

These ideologies took off after the victory of Jean Lesage&#x27;s liberal party in the 1960 provincial election. The election of Jean Lesage and his liberal party finally ended the longstanding ancient regime the people of Quebec had been living under. It began the reinstitution of the outdated socioeconomic and political structures to fully modernize them once and for all. This movement would be known as the Quiet Revolution.

The Quiet Revolution signified something different for Quebeckers but a common denominator was that both English and French speakers were happy with the end to Maurice Duplessis&#x27;s conservative party the Union Nationale that brought much social and political repression. The Quiet Revolution beginning in the 1960s gathered momentum with the many reformations carried out by Jean Lesage including changes to the education, social welfare, hospitalization, hydro-electricity, regional development and greater francophone participation in the industrial sector.

Quebec nationalism for the Francophones was on the rise at this time not only within the province but on a global scale as well. Quebec nationalism in the 1960s stemmed from the ideology of decolonization; this new type of nationalism was based on ideas happening on a global scale. Because of the new openness of the province, travelers and people of the church were encouraged to go and learn the ways of life in other parts of the world and then return to share, compare, and incorporate the ideologies into their lifestyle.

The oppression of Francophones was also something that Lesage wanted to bring to light and change because of the longstanding cultural and society tension between the Francophones and Anglophones. Lesage had the desire to change the role that the state had over the province. He no longer wanted economic inferiority of French Canadians and the Francophone society, but rather evolving organized labor, educational reform, and the modernization of political process.

There were many issues that the province had during this time due to the imbalance between the Francophones and Anglophones on a variety of levels. Even though the Francophones outnumbered the Anglophones, the Francophones were still seen as a minority. This oppression however dated further back than just the 1960s.

The province has a history of colonization and conquest that is complex and multi layered. The past history of this province can be seen in the city&#x27;s landscape marked with a variety of memoir commemorating the overtaking powers.

The province&#x27;s Francophones as well as ethnic and racial minority groups did not have any power, they were living in the poorest parts of cities. It was hard for these groups to progress in their careers or climb the socio-economic ladder. For Francophones it was difficult because success was geared towards the English speaker and prestigious institutions were English speaking and devalued the culture and language of the French.

By the early 1960s a group of French Canadians from all classes were receiving proper education but only to go into careers in Anglophone dominated institutions.

Advocacy of the new form of nationalism was used to address the drastic conditions in the work place as well as living conditions. This was most apparent between the Francophones who believed in the new 1960s idea of nationalism and the predominantly English Canadian anti-nationalists. The goal of the new society was to overcome injustices for minority groups in everyday life. This sparked a number of movements such as the Black Power movement and Women&#x27;s Rights Movement that were mainly seen in working-class neighbourhoods which gained publicity when journals, conferences and advocates fed into these movements.

A movement of a new Quebec with a new meaning behind the word Nationalism would continue to change and progress overtime with the 1960s being the start of this change.

==Contemporary Quebec nationalism==
Understanding contemporary Quebec nationalism is difficult considering the ongoing debates on the political status of the province and its complex public opinion. No political option (outright independence, sovereignty-association, constitutional reforms, or signing on to the present Canadian constitution) has achieved decisive majority support and contradictions remain within the Quebec polity.

One debated subject that has often made the news is whether contemporary Quebec nationalism is still &quot;ethnic&quot; or if it is &quot;linguistic&quot; or &quot;territorial&quot;.

The notion of &quot;territorial nationalism&quot; (promoted by all Quebec premiers since Jean Lesage) gathers the support of the majority of the sovereigntists and essentially all Quebec federalist nationalists. Debates on the nature of Quebec&#x27;s nationalism are currently going on and various intellectuals from Quebec or other parts of Canada have published works on the subject, notably Will Kymlicka, professor of philosophy at Queen&#x27;s University and Charles Blattberg and Michel Seymour, both professors at the .

=== Ethnic nationalism ===
Many people feel that Quebec nationalism and separatism is ethnic have often expressed their opinion that the sentiments of Quebec&#x27;s nationalists are insular and parochial and concerned with preserving a population of white francophones within the province. Despite these accusations being denounced by many Quebec nationalists who see both the separatist and nationalist movement as multi-ethnic, there is much evidence to suggest that both movements are based on ethnicity, rather than on territory. An example of this is when Premier of Quebec Jacques Parizeau, commenting on the failure of the 1995 Quebec referendum said &quot;It is true, it is true that we were beaten, but in the end, by what? By money and ethnic votes, essentially.&quot; (&quot;&quot;).
Another example of this was the implementation of Quebec&#x27;s Bill 21, which sparked controversy after it banned people from wearing religious clothing in certain professions. This law hugely impacted the Muslim community in the province, with many citing it as proof of the movement&#x27;s ethnic origins, and calling it Islamophobic, and discriminatory. Further controversy was sparked when most nationalist parties stated that the law was not Islamophobic, and instead stated that it was secular. Paul Plamondon, leader of the Parti Québécois (PQ) called someone in the Quebec government out for saying the law was &quot;supremacist&quot; while talking about systemic racism, which caused even more controversy and a backlash to the PQ by the Muslim community, and by the federalists.
Quebec nationalism and separatism being ethnically based was further evidenced when the PQ held a protest in Montreal on November 23, 2020, which called for the assimilation of immigrants, and for the strengthening on the French Language in the city. Less than 150 people turned out for the occasion, and by the PQ, as well as other nationalist and separatist parties refusing to acknowledge the existence of systemic racism in Quebec. The president of Quebec&#x27;s human&#x27;s rights commission, Philippe-André Tessier, a separatist, called the term &quot;systemic racism&quot; an &quot;attack on the Quebec people&quot;.

=== Linguistic nationalism ===

Another primary expression of nationalism in Quebec is the French language. People who feel that Quebec nationalism is linguistic have often expressed their opinion that Quebec nationalism includes a multi-ethnic or multicultural French-speaking majority (either as mother tongue or first language used in public).

The entrenchment of the French language in Quebec has been a central goal of Quebec nationalism since the 1970s. In 1974, the Quebec Legislature passed the &quot;Official Language Act&quot; under Premier Robert Bourassa. This legislation made French the sole official language of Quebec and the primary language of services, commercial signing, labour relations and business, education, and legislation and justice. In 1977, this &quot;Official Language Act&quot; was superseded by the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot;, which expanded and entrenched French within Quebec. This charter was passed by the first Parti Québécois government of Premier René Lévesque, and its goal was &quot;to make French the language of Government and the Law, as well as the normal and everyday language of work, instruction, communication, commerce and business.&quot;

After a 45-year hiatus in language legislation in Quebec, the provincial legislature passed &quot;An Act respecting French, the official and common language of Québec&quot; in 2022. This act greatly expanded the requirement to speak French in many public and private settings. The preliminary notes of the bill make its purpose clear: &quot;the purpose of this bill is to affirm that the only official language of Québec is French. It also affirms that French is the common language of the Québec nation.&quot; This act amended the &quot;Charter of the French language&quot; and introduced &quot;new fundamental language rights,&quot; such as reinforcing French as the language of legislation, justice, civil administration, professional orders, employers, commerce and business, and educational instruction. Premier François Legault and his Coalition Avenir Québec government justified this as necessary to preserve the French language that is central to Quebec nationalism.

=== Recognition of the nation by Ottawa ===

On October 21, 2006, during the General Special Council of the Quebec wing of the Liberal Party of Canada initiated a national debate by adopting with more than 80% support a resolution calling on the Government of Canada to recognize the Quebec nation within Canada. A month later, the said resolution was taken to Parliament first by the , then by the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper. On November 27, 2006, the House of Commons of Canada passed a motion recognizing that the &quot;Québécois form a nation within a united Canada&quot;.

In 2021, François Legault&#x27;s government in Quebec proposed to amend the Charter of the French Language and the provincial constitution to more strongly entrench French as the sole official language. In response to this, the initiated a motion in the House of Commons endorsing the constitutionality of Legault&#x27;s initiatives and reasserting Quebecers&#x27; nationhood. The Commons passed the motion 281–2, with 36 abstentions.

=== Present-day nationalism ===
Quebec nationalism today and what it means to , Quebecers, , Canadians, and others differs based on the individual. Nationalism today is more open than what it was in the past in some ways. A common theme that can be seen is the attachment that have towards their province, and the country of Canada.

<text>The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is an art museum in Boston, Massachusetts, which houses significant examples of European, Asian, and American art. Its collection includes paintings, sculpture, tapestries, and decorative arts. It was founded by Isabella Stewart Gardner, whose will called for her art collection to be permanently exhibited &quot;for the education and enjoyment of the public forever.&quot;

The museum opened in 1903. An auxiliary wing designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano, adjacent to the original structure near the Back Bay Fens, was completed in 2012.

In 1990, thirteen of the museum&#x27;s works were stolen; the crime remains unsolved, and the works, valued at an estimated $500 million, have not been recovered.

==History==
The museum was built in 1898–1901 by Isabella Stewart Gardner (1840–1924), an American art collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts in the style of a 15th-century Venetian palace. It opened to the public in 1903.

Gardner began collecting seriously after she received a large inheritance from her father in 1891. Her purchase of Johannes Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;The Concert&quot; (c. 1664) at auction in Paris in 1892 was her first major acquisition. In 1894, Bernard Berenson offered his services in helping her acquire a Botticelli. With his help, Gardner became the first American to own a painting by the Renaissance master. Berenson helped acquire nearly 70 works of art for her collection.
After her husband John L. Gardner&#x27;s death in 1898, Isabella Gardner realized their shared dream of building a suitable space to exhibit their treasures. She purchased land in the marshy Fenway area of Boston, and hired architect Willard T. Sears to build Fenway Court, modeled on the Renaissance palaces of Venice. Gardner was deeply involved in every aspect of the design, leading Sears to quip that he was merely the structural engineer making Gardner&#x27;s design possible. After the construction of the building was complete, Gardner spent a year installing her collection in a way that evokes intimate responses to the art, mixing paintings, furniture, textiles and objects from different cultures and periods among well-known European paintings and sculpture.

The museum opened on January 1, 1903, with a grand celebration featuring a performance by members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and a menu that included champagne and doughnuts. In 1909, the Museum of Fine Arts moved to its new home close by.

During Gardner&#x27;s lifetime, she welcomed artists, performers, and scholars to Fenway Court to draw inspiration from the rich collection and dazzling Venetian setting, including John Singer Sargent, Charles Martin Loeffler, and Ruth St. Denis, among others. Gardner also occasionally hosted artists&#x27; exhibitions within Fenway Court, including one of Anna Coleman Ladd. Today, the museum&#x27;s contemporary artist-in-residence program, courtyard garden displays, concerts, and innovative education programs continue Isabella Gardner&#x27;s legacy.

When Gardner died in 1924, her will created an endowment of $1 million and outlined stipulations for the support of the museum, including the charge that her collection be permanently exhibited &quot;for the education and enjoyment of the public forever&quot; according to her aesthetic vision and intent.

Gardner appointed her secretary and the former librarian of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Morris Carter (1877–1965) as the museum&#x27;s first director. Carter catalogued the entire collection and wrote Gardner&#x27;s definitive biography, &quot;Isabella Stewart Gardner and Fenway Court&quot;. George L. Stout (1897–1978) was the second director. The father of modern conservation, Stout ensured the long-term preservation of the collection and historic structure. Rollin Van Nostrand Hadley (1927–1992) became the third director in 1970. Hadley increased visiting hours, instituted the Membership Program and added a cafe. Hadley also wrote several catalogs for the museum, produced &quot;Fenway Court&quot;, an annual scholarly publication, and wrote the 1987 book &quot;The Letters of Bernard Berenson and Isabella Stewart Gardner&quot; (Northeastern University Press). Anne Hawley was director from 1989 until 2015. Peggy Fogelman, the Norma Jean Calderwood Director, began her tenure as director of the museum in 2016.

===Art theft of 1990===
Early in the morning of March 18, 1990, two thieves disguised as police officers robbed the museum of thirteen works worth some $500 millionthe greatest known property theft in history. Among the works was &quot;The Concert&quot; (c. 1664), one of only 34 known by Johannes Vermeer and thought to be the most valuable unrecovered painting at over $200 million. Also missing is &quot;The Storm on the Sea of Galilee&quot; (1633), Rembrandt&#x27;s only known seascape. Some of the canvases were crudely cut out of their stretchers.

The works have not been recovered. The museum initially offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to recovery of the art, doubled in May 2017 to $10 million. Empty frames hang in the Dutch Room gallery as placeholders for the missing works. The selection of stolen works puzzled experts, as more valuable artworks were present in the museum. According to the FBI, the stolen artwork was moved through the region and offered for sale in Philadelphia during the early 2000s. They believe the thieves were members of a criminal organization based in the mid-Atlantic and New England. The statute of limitations on the theft has expired but criminal charges could be laid if an individual is found to be in possession of stolen property.

In April 2021, Netflix began streaming a four-part documentary about the theft: &quot;This Is a Robbery: The World’s Biggest Art Heist.&quot;

=== Extension and preservation project ===
In 2002, after a two-year master planning process, the museum&#x27;s board of trustees determined that a new wing was necessary to preserve the historic building and to provide improved spaces for programs that continue Isabella Gardner&#x27;s legacy. In 2004, Pritzker Prize–winning architect Renzo Piano and the Renzo Piano Building Workshop (Genoa, Italy) were selected to design the new wing. In 2009, the final approval for the expansion project was given, but there was much debate about the carriage house. The carriage house, originally built in 1907, was argued to be important for the intent of the first owners, yet the building was torn down in hopes of having the museum preserve the main building. In 2016, the new wing was praised for its appearance by the Boston Society of Architects and awarded a medal for its beauty. The design for the new wing is conceived as a respectful complement to the historic Museum building in scale, form, and materials.

The project adds consisting of two new buildings. The first building attaches to the original museum and takes on the appearance of four stories in glass and copper. The second building is smaller and is used for greenhouses and living quarters. The new expansion includes spaces for visitor services, concerts, special exhibitions, and education and landscape programs, furthering Isabella Gardner&#x27;s legacy in art, music, and horticulture while reducing 21st-century strain on the collection and galleries. The project was completed in 2012, and cost $118 million.

==Design==
Built to evoke a 15th-century Venetian palace, the museum building provides an atmospheric setting for Gardner&#x27;s inventive creation. Gardner hired Willard T. Sears to design the building near the marshy Back Bay Fens to house her growing art collection. Inside the museum, three floors of galleries surround a garden courtyard blooming with life in all seasons. The fourth floor was Gardner&#x27;s private apartments, now used for administration, and rarely for exhibits.

It is a common misconception that the building was brought to Boston from Venice and reconstructed. It was built from the ground up in Boston out of new materials, though it incorporates numerous architectural elements removed from European Gothic and Renaissance structures, worked into the design of the turn-of-the-century building. Special tiles were custom designed for the floors, modern concrete was used for some of the structural elements, and antique capitals sit atop modern columns. The interior garden courtyard is covered by a glass roof, with steel support structure original to the building. The Gardner Museum is much admired for the intimate atmosphere in which its works of art are displayed and for its flower-filled courtyard. Most of the art pieces are unlabeled, and the generally low lighting is more akin to a private house than a modern art museum.

In 1983, the museum was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 2013, the museum was designated a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission.

==Collection==

Gardner collected and carefully displayed a collection of more than 7500 paintings, sculptures, furniture, textiles, silver, ceramics, 1500 rare books, and 7000 archival objects from ancient Rome, Medieval Europe, Renaissance Italy, Asia, the Islamic world, and 19th-century France and America. Among the artists represented in the galleries are Titian, Rembrandt, Michelangelo, Raphael, Botticelli, Manet, Degas, Whistler and Sargent. The first Matisse to enter an American collection is housed in the Yellow Room.

Well-known artworks in the museum&#x27;s collection include Titian&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of Europa&quot;, John Singer Sargent&#x27;s &quot;El Jaleo&quot; and &quot;Portrait of Isabella Stewart Gardner&quot;, Fra Angelico&#x27;s &quot;Death and Assumption of the Virgin&quot;, Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Self-Portrait, Aged 23&quot;, Cellini&#x27;s &quot;Bindo Altoviti&quot;, Piero della Francesca&#x27;s &quot;Hercules&quot;, and Botticelli&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Lucretia&quot;.

The archives hold more than 7,000 letters from 1,000 correspondents, including Henry Adams, T.S. Eliot, Sarah Bernhardt, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, in addition to travel albums, dealer receipts, and guest books.

The galleries also contain Gardner&#x27;s little-known but extensive book collection that includes early-print editions and manuscripts of Dante, works by miniaturist Jean Bourdichon, incunables, and illuminated manuscripts.

==Current programs==
The museum regularly produces scholarly exhibitions, lectures, family programs, and symposia that provide insights into the historic collection. Through the Artist-in-Residence program, artists in many disciplines are invited to live at and draw inspiration from the museum. The museum often hosts exhibitions of contemporary art, performances, and programs by those selected. The Gardner&#x27;s concert series welcomes musicians and emerging artists to perform classical masterpieces, new music, and jazz on Sunday afternoons and select Thursday evenings. The musical program is also available through concert videos, audio recordings, and a free classical music podcast.

The Gardner is part of the Monuments Men and Women Museum Network, launched in 2021 by the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art.

The Museum offers free admission to all those named Isabella, for life. &#x27;

<text>The Inland Revenue was, until April 2005, a department of the British Government responsible for the collection of direct taxation, including income tax, national insurance contributions, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, corporation tax, petroleum revenue tax and stamp duty. More recently, the Inland Revenue also administered the Tax Credits schemes, whereby monies, such as Working Tax Credit (WTC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC), are paid by the government into a recipient&#x27;s bank account or as part of their wages. The Inland Revenue was also responsible for the payment of child benefit (from 1999).

The Inland Revenue was merged with HM Customs and Excise to form HM Revenue and Customs which came into existence on 18 April 2005. The current name was promoted by the use of the expression &quot;from Revenue and Customs&quot; in a series of annual radio, and to a lesser extent, television public information broadcasts in the 2000s and 2010s.

==History==

===The Board of Taxes===
The beginnings of the Inland Revenue date from 1665, when a Board of Taxes was set up following the introduction of special taxes to pay for the Second Anglo-Dutch War. A central organisation to supervise the collection of the special taxes was required; it became known as the Tax Office. 

Taxes administered by the Board of Taxes included the Land Tax, first levied in 1692, along with the window tax and house tax, both of which dated from 1696. In 1785 a number of other miscellaneous taxes, administered by the Stamp Office and the Excise Office, were transferred to the Tax Office; these included taxes on carriages (dating from 1747), on wagons and carts, on male servants (1777) and on horses (1784). Together with the House Tax and the Window Tax, they came to be known as the &#x27;assessed taxes&#x27; and were intended as a progressive form of taxation on the wealthy. 

Income tax was introduced in various forms in 1797, 1799, 1803 to 1816, and then reintroduced in 1842 as an annual tax which is formally renewed in each year&#x27;s Finance Act.

===The Board of Stamps===
A separate Board of Stamps was created by the Stamps Act 1694. During the 18th and early 19th centuries at various times (as financial strains on the economy demanded, and Parliament allowed) stamp duties were extended above a certain threshold of sale value to cover newspapers, pamphlets, lottery tickets, apprentices&#x27; indentures, advertisements, playing cards, dice, hats, gloves, patent medicines, perfumes, insurance policies, gold and silver plate and armorial bearings (coats of arms). One further category is the most widely cited example of an unpopular and most difficult to enforce tax, the Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795. The last stamp taxes to remain are stamp duty land tax and stamp duty reserve tax; however the use of physical stamps has ceased.

===The Board of Stamps and Taxes===
In June 1833, following a steady reduction in the number of different taxes and duties being levied, a single body of commissioners was set up to merge the revenues of stamps and taxes. The Board of Taxes and the Board of Stamps were formally combined under the Land Tax Act 1834 to form the Board of Stamps and Taxes.

===The Board of Inland Revenue===

The Board of Inland Revenue was created under the , after the Board of Excise and the Board of Stamps and Taxes were amalgamated. Responsibility for excise duties was transferred to the Board of Customs and Excise in 1909.

In 1995 to help promote self-assessment tax returns, Inland Revenue created the character of Hector the Tax Inspector to help in their advertising campaign.

===HM Revenue and Customs===
The 2004 Budget included proposals to merge HM Customs and Excise with the Board of Inland Revenue to form a new department, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The merger was implemented by the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 with effect from 18 April 2005.

==List of taxes==

The following taxes were administered at various times either by the Inland Revenue or by its predecessors (excise duties are not included):

The Inland Revenue also received National Insurance contributions and administered child benefit payments and Tax Credits.

==Notable staff==

===Ministerial leadership===

The leadership and taking of the highest level of decisions is ministerial as the concept of any particular tax and the degree of success in collecting any particular tax rests ultimately with the political decisions taken. Of particular relevance are the debates in Parliament in their imposition.

===Civil servants===

The Permanent Secretary to the Treasury has the main advisory, policy informative role to play in the enabling of the department&#x27;s functions, in liaison with board chairman who bore overall responsibility along with the rest of the board for the operational carrying out of the Inland Revenue&#x27;s functions.

As sub-departments (typically, Offices, Boards and Bureaus) have issued their own taxes or expanded their remit, they too have seen Comptrollers General and Chairmen. An example was Robert Wilkie Stanton, Comptroller of Stamps and Taxes (Scotland), Board of Inland Revenue.

==STEPS contract==
In 2001 the Inland Revenue entered into a Private Finance Initiative within the framework of the STEPS-contract (Strategic Transfer of the Estate to the Private Sector) whereby it sold two-thirds of its estate to Mapeley for £370 million and then leased the properties back.

<doc id="376897" wikidata="Q626960" url="?curid=376897" title="Jamais vu">
<text>In psychology, jamais vu ( , , ), a French loanword meaning &quot;never seen&quot;, is the phenomenon of experiencing a situation that one recognizes in some fashion, but that nonetheless seems novel and unfamiliar.

==Overview==
&quot;Jamais vu&quot; involves a sense of eeriness and the observer’s impression of experiencing something for the first time, despite rationally knowing that they have experienced it before. 

&quot;Jamais vu&quot; is commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word or, less commonly, a person or place, that they already know. &quot;Jamais vu&quot; is sometimes associated with certain types of aphasia, amnesia, and epilepsy. 

The phenomenon is often grouped with &quot;déjà vu&quot; and &quot;presque vu&quot; (&quot;tip of the tongue&quot;, literally &quot;almost seen&quot;). It is generally a rare phenomenon.

===Experiment===
A study by Chris Moulin of Leeds University asked 92 volunteers to write out &quot;door&quot; 30 times in 60 seconds. In July 2006, at the 4th International Conference on Memory in Sydney, he reported that 68 percent of volunteers showed symptoms of &quot;jamais vu&quot;, such as beginning to doubt that &quot;door&quot; was a real word. Moulin believes that a similar brain fatigue underlies some symptoms of schizophrenia and Capgras delusion. Moulin suggests that people with these conditions could be suffering from chronic &quot;jamais vu&quot;.

==Causes==
&quot;Jamais vu&quot; can be caused by epileptic seizures.

== Related phenomena ==
*&quot;Déjà vu&quot;: having the strong sensation that an event or experience being experienced, has already been experienced in the past, whether it has actually happened or not. In French, this means &#x27;already seen&#x27;.
* Tip of the tongue: almost, but not quite, remembering something.

<doc id="376898" wikidata="Q692942" url="?curid=376898" title="Westboro Baptist Church">
<text>The Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) is an American, unaffiliated Primitive Baptist church in Topeka, Kansas, that was founded in 1955 by pastor Fred Phelps. It is widely considered a hate group and a cult, and is known for its public protests against gay people and for its usage of the phrases &quot;God hates fags&quot; and &quot;Thank God for dead soldiers&quot;. It also engages in hate speech against atheists, Jews, Muslims, transgender people, and other Christian denominations. The WBC&#x27;s theology and practices are widely condemned by other Christian churches, including the Baptist World Alliance and the Southern Baptist Convention, and by politicians and public figures, including former U.S. President Barack Obama. 

WBC has been protesting against homosexuality since 1989. Within a few years, the group expanded to protesting across the country. They often protest at public and private events, including funerals, sports games, and concerts. The group protested at the funerals for victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and the West Nickel Mines School shooting. The group is known to deface the American flag or fly it upside down while protesting. It also draws counter-protests.

Although the group&#x27;s right to protest and use hate speech in the United States is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the group has faced numerous legal challenges over its history. A 2006 Act of Congress called the Respect for America&#x27;s Fallen Heroes Act, created primarily due to WBC, placed restrictions on protests at some cemeteries. The 2010–2011 US Supreme Court case &quot;Snyder v. Phelps&quot; shielded the group from tort liability for a 2006 protest at a military funeral. WBC also files its own lawsuits via a Phelps family law firm (eleven of Phelps&#x27; children are lawyers), and has won cases that have yielded thousands of dollars for the group. Members of the group have been banned from entering Canada and the United Kingdom after attempting to protest in those countries.

In 2016, &quot;Forbes&quot; stated WBC had about 70 members. The group primarily consists of members of Phelps&#x27;s extended family, although many of its members have left or been excommunicated. Several family members, including Nathan Phelps and Megan Phelps-Roper, have left the church and become activists against it. Fred Phelps himself was excommunicated from the church around August 2013. Before his death in 2014, a church spokesperson stated that the group did not have a defined leader a very long time&quot;. Several former members have accused the group of brainwashing and abusive behavior.

== History ==
Westboro Baptist Church originated as a branch of the East Side Baptist Church, which was established in 1931 on the east side of Topeka. In 1954, East Side hired Fred Phelps as an associate pastor. By 1955, Phelps was promoted to pastor of a new East Side church plant, Westboro Baptist, on the west side of Topeka. Its first public service was held on November 27, 1955. Westboro is independent of any denomination, and after Westboro was established, Phelps broke ties with East Side to become entirely independent. His vitriolic preaching alienated nearly the entirety of the original congregation, who either returned to East Side or joined other congregations (Baptist organizations including the Baptist World Alliance and the Southern Baptist Convention have denounced the teachings and doctrinal beliefs of Westboro), leaving him with a small following consisting almost entirely of his own relatives and close friends.

Phelps was a veteran of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. He founded the Phelps Chartered law firm in 1964, which has since been used to sue communities that are targets of Westboro&#x27;s protests.

Westboro Baptist first began protesting homosexuality in 1989 after the discovery of what they referred to as a &quot;tearoom&quot;, meaning a public lavatory used for homosexual interactions. The group later began picketing Gage Park six blocks northwest of its headquarters in Topeka in 1991, saying it was a den of anonymous homosexual activity. Soon, its protests had spread throughout the city, and within three years WBC was traveling across the country. Phelps explained in 1994 that he considered the negative reaction to the picketing to be proof of his righteousness.

On August 20, 1995, a pipe bomb exploded outside the home of Shirley Phelps-Roper, the daughter of Fred Phelps. The blast damaged an SUV, a fence, and part of the house, but no one was injured. In 1996, two men were arrested for the bombing, and both admitted to causing the blast. They had believed Phelps-Roper&#x27;s house was that of the pastor and wanted to retaliate against Westboro&#x27;s anti-gay protests at Washburn University. One of the bombers was fined $1,751 and was sentenced to 16 days in prison plus 100 hours of community service.

Fred Phelps died of natural causes on March 19, 2014. His daughter Shirley said a funeral would not be held because Westboro does not &quot;worship the dead&quot;. He had previously been voted out of his leadership position and, according to representatives, the organization had no defined leader in the time leading up to his death.

==Positions and views==
Westboro Baptists believe in five-point Calvinism, as reflected in the TULIP acronym that is displayed prominently at the front of the church sanctuary. They believe in limited atonement, unconditional election, and the double predestination of both the saved and the damned, which can weigh heavily on members as well as those who leave the church. According to Barrett-Fox, they see &quot;moral living as a sign of election&quot; and they say they have a duty to preach to the public, not to &quot;save people&quot; (who are predestined) but to spread a message of obedience to God. In her dissertation on Westboro Baptist, she labels this theology as Hyper-Calvinist.

They see themselves as coming from the Primitive Baptist movement. Their Primitive Baptist practices include their style of worship, approach to church discipline, liturgical preferences and seeing themselves as from a &quot;separatist, antiestablishment&quot; lineage (p. 66).

===Anti-homosexuality===
WBC is known for its homophobic rhetoric. The Anti-Defamation League describes the group as &quot;virulently homophobic&quot;, saying its anti-homosexual rhetoric is often a cover for antisemitism, anti-Americanism, racism, and hatred of other Christian groups. The Southern Poverty Law Center has added WBC to a list of hate groups for its homophobia. The group has also expressed transphobic messages in its protests. Its homophobic outlook has led its members to protest LGBT pride events and funerals of those who died due to HIV/AIDS, as well as blame homosexuals for mass-casualty events such as the September 11 attacks.

===Antisemitism===

In 1996, Phelps began a campaign called &quot;Topeka&#x27;s Baptist Holocaust&quot;, whereby he attempted to draw attention to attacks perpetrated against WBC picketers, saying they were not random but organized attacks orchestrated by Jews and homosexuals. Phelps announced, &quot;Jews killed Christ&quot;, and &quot;Fag Jew Nazis are worse than ordinary Nazis. They&#x27;ve had more experience. The First Holocaust was a Jewish Holocaust against Christians. The latest Holocaust is by Topeka Jews against Westboro Baptist Church.&quot;

In another statement, he said &quot;Topeka Jews today stir up Kansas tyrants in persecuting Westboro Baptists. They whine about the Nazi Holocaust, while they perpetrate the Topeka Holocaust.&quot;

A March 25, 2006, flier regarding a Jewish adversary of Phelps uses the phrase &quot;bloody Jew&quot; four times and the phrase &quot;evil Jew&quot; more than once every 12 sentences. The Anti-Defamation League has criticized WBC and Phelps, and keeps a sampling of WBC&#x27;s fliers regarding Judaism on their website.

In an interview, Margie Phelps said WBC targeted the American Jewish community because members had &quot;testified&quot; to gentiles for 19 years that &quot;America is doomed&quot; and that &quot;Now it&#x27;s too late. We&#x27;re done with them.&quot; She also claimed Jews were &quot;one of the loudest voices&quot; in favor of homosexuality and abortion, and that &quot;[Jews] claim to be God&#x27;s chosen people. Do you think that God is going to wink at that forever?&quot; Phelps concluded by stating, in an apparent reference to the Book of Revelation, that all the nations of the world would soon march on Israel, and that they would be led by President Barack Obama, whom she called the &quot;Antichrist&quot;.

===Islamophobia===
Jael Phelps said in a 2011 interview that she and the other members of WBC tauntingly and publicly burned a copy of the Quran while being scolded by a Muslim man, calling it an &quot;idolatrous piece of trash&quot; and that they were giving it the &quot;proper respect that it deserves&quot; by doing so. They picketed the funeral of the Muslim man&#x27;s wife the following week. Jael Phelps said the wife&#x27;s death was partly due to her Muslim husband having spoken out against WBC, and therefore rejecting God and bringing his &quot;righteous judgement&quot; down upon him. She also commented that &quot;all those angry little Muslims can just shut their mouths.&quot;

In 2010, Westboro Baptists said they would again burn a Quran as an example of idolatry today.

===Barack Obama conspiracy theories===
Margie Phelps, daughter of Fred Phelps and attorney for WBC, said in an interview with Fox News that Barack Obama would &quot;absolutely&quot; be going to Hell and that he was &quot;most likely the Beast spoken of in the Revelation.&quot; She also said Obama&#x27;s presidency was a sign of the Apocalypse. On January 20, 2013, picketers of the Westboro Baptist Church protested Obama&#x27;s second inauguration. The protesters had a legal permit and used signs with homophobic messages as well as referring to Obama as the Antichrist.

== Structure and picketing ==

WBC consists primarily of members of Fred Phelps&#x27;s extended family. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, it has roughly 70 members as of 2016, having previously had 80 members in 2011. In her book on Westboro Baptists, religious studies scholar Rebecca Barrett-Fox describes their identification with Primitive Baptists. Members attend a weekly service and believe in a theology of predestination which includes believing all disasters and catastrophes come from the hand of God. Members follow the organization&#x27;s &#x27;literal&#x27; interpretation of the Bible which informs their attitudes towards homosexuality and towards Judaism. The religious justification for active political hate speech has led to much controversy.WBC&#x27;s travel expenses have exceeded as much as $200,000 annually. One of Westboro&#x27;s followers estimated the organization spends $250,000 a year on picketing. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, it is funded entirely from within the organization and accepts no outside donations. WBC has received money from lawsuits and legal fees, through the closely related Phelps Chartered law firm, when its protests have been unlawfully disrupted. For example, the firm sued the city of Topeka several times in the 1990s, and received $16,500 in legal fees for a court case won against a Marine&#x27;s bereaved father. Because the firm represents WBC in its lawsuits, it can use money from cases it wins to further fund the organization under the Civil Rights Attorney&#x27;s Fees Award Act of 1976. WBC is considered a nonprofit organization by the federal government, and is therefore exempt from paying taxes. All five of Phelps Chartered&#x27;s lawyers are Phelps&#x27;s children, and eleven of his thirteen children are lawyers. Members of the Phelps family are expected to give ten percent of their earnings to WBC.

WBC carries out daily picketing in Topeka and travels nationally to picket the funerals of gay victims of murder or gay-bashing, as well as those of people who have died from complications related to AIDS. It also pickets other events related or peripherally related to homosexuality; Kansas City Chiefs football games, and live pop concerts. At its peak, the group was able to picket roughly 15 churches a day, including many in Topeka and some events farther afield. The group has protested a number of high-profile events such as the funerals of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and the West Nickel Mines School shooting. As well as protesting these high-profile events, WBC protests many local low-profile events. While the messages are widely condemned, it always ensures its protests are legal in nature. Through keeping the protests non-violent and acquiring the proper permits, WBC avoids legal trouble. However, it is the protesting of military funerals that led to the organization receiving much attention. Its public acts have cast a political spotlight on the group that has given it vast attention for its small size. On two occasions, WBC accepted offers for radio air time in exchange for canceling an announced protest.

WBC also releases parody songs. According to Steve Drain (WBC&#x27;s public information officer) in an interview with Vice News, &quot;When we make our choice of songs, that really revolves around mostly popularity. It&#x27;s mostly mainstream stuff, the whole idea of our doing parodies is to preach.&quot;

==Legal responses==
===Laws limiting funeral protests===
In response to the protests conducted by Westboro members at Indiana funerals, a bill was introduced in the Indiana General Assembly that would make it a felony to protest within of a funeral. Shortly before this bill was signed members of the church had threatened to protest in Kokomo, Indiana, at a funeral service that was being held for a soldier who was killed in Iraq. On January 11, 2006, the bill unanimously (11–0) passed a committee vote, and while members of the church had traveled to Kokomo to protest, they were not seen during or after the funeral service. On May 23, 2006, the state of Michigan banned any intentional disruption of funerals within of the ceremony.

On May 17, 2006, the state of Illinois enacted Senate Bill 1144, the &quot;Let Them Rest In Peace Act&quot;, to shield grieving military families from protests during funerals and memorial services of fallen military service members.

On March 29, 2006, the Respect for America&#x27;s Fallen Heroes Act was introduced by Mike Rogers, a Republican member of the House. The bipartisan bill received a 408–3 vote in the House. The Senate unanimously voted in approval of the law. On May 29, 2006, President George W. Bush signed the bill into law at a Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. The bill prohibits protests within of the entrance of any cemetery under control of the National Cemetery Administration from 60 minutes before to 60 minutes after a funeral.

On January 11, 2011, the state of Arizona held an emergency legislative session to pass a bill barring protests within of a funeral and within an hour from its beginning or end. The bill was swiftly signed into law ahead of the January 12 funeral of those killed in the 2011 Tucson shooting.

On August 2, 2012, the U.S. Congress passed a bill that included restrictions on demonstrators at military funerals, which became law four days later when signed by Obama, who condemned the WBC. This bill was primarily motivated by the WBC&#x27;s protests at memorial services for victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Several petitions to the White House were submitted, calling on President Barack Obama to legally recognize the WBC as a hate group, revoke its tax exemption for religious organizations, and to ban protests at funerals and memorial services. The bill mandated staying at least 300 feet (91 m) away from funerals and homes of family members for two hours before until two hours after a funeral. The church condemned the restrictions.

===Supreme Court case===

On March 10, 2006, the WBC picketed the funeral of Marine Lance Corporal Matthew A. Snyder in Westminster, Maryland. A cordoned off picket was held approximately from the church for about 30 minutes before the funeral began. Snyder&#x27;s father, Albert, sued for defamation, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit alleged Fred Phelps, Rebekah Phelps-Davis, and Shirley Phelps-Roper were responsible for publishing defamatory statements about the Snyder family on the internet, including that Albert and his wife had &quot;raised [Matthew] for the devil&quot; and taught him &quot;to defy his Creator, to divorce, and to commit adultery&quot;. Other statements denounced them for raising their son Catholic. Snyder further alleged the defendants had intruded upon and staged protests at his son&#x27;s funeral. The defamation count was dismissed on First Amendment grounds, but the case proceeded to trial on the remaining two counts.

District Judge Richard D. Bennett instructed the jury to decide &quot;whether the defendant&#x27;s actions would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, whether they were extreme and outrageous and whether these actions were so offensive and shocking as to not be entitled to First Amendment protection&quot;. On October 31, 2007, Phelps, Shirley Phelps-Roper and Rebecca Phelps-Davis were found liable for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The jury awarded Snyder a total of $10,900,000; $2.9 million in compensatory damages, $6 million in punitive damages for invasion of privacy and $2 million for causing emotional distress. The group unsuccessfully sought a mistrial based on alleged prejudicial statements made by the judge and violations of the gag order by the plaintiff&#x27;s attorney. On February 4, 2008, Bennett upheld the ruling but reduced the punitive damages to $2.1 million. Liens were ordered on WBC buildings and Phelps&#x27;s law office.

On September 24, 2009, a federal appeals court reversed the lower court&#x27;s award. It found the picket near the funeral was protected speech because it involved &quot;matters of public concern, including the issues of homosexuals in the military, the sex-abuse scandal within the Catholic Church, and the political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens&quot;, and did not violate the privacy of the service member&#x27;s family. On March 30, 2010, the appeals court ordered Snyder to pay WBC&#x27;s court costs of over $16,000, a move Snyder&#x27;s attorneys referred to as &quot;adding insult to injury&quot;.

On March 8, 2010, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in &quot;Snyder v. Phelps&quot;. On May 28, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and 42 other senators filed an &quot;amicus&quot; brief in support of Snyder. On June 1, Kansas Attorney General Stephen Six filed a separate brief supporting Snyder which was joined by the Attorneys General of 47 other states and the District of Columbia. Several news and civil rights organizations filed &quot;amicus&quot; briefs in support of Phelps. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Phelps on March 2, 2011. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote of the 8–1 decision: &quot;What Westboro said, in the whole context of how and where it chose to say it, is entitled to &#x27;special protection&#x27; under the First Amendment and that protection cannot be overcome by a jury finding that the picketing was outrageous.&quot;

=== Entry bans ===
In August 2008, Canadian officials learned of WBC&#x27;s intent to stage a protest at the funeral of Tim McLean, a Winnipeg resident who was killed on a bus. The protests intended to convey the message that the man&#x27;s murder was God&#x27;s response to Canadian laws permitting abortion, homosexuality, divorce and remarriage. In response, Canadian officials barred the organization&#x27;s members from entering the country.

In February 2009, British news sources discovered WBC had announced, via its website, its intent to picket a youth production of &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; to be held at Central Studio, Queen Mary&#x27;s College in the town of Basingstoke, Hampshire, on February 20, 2009. This would have been its first picket in the United Kingdom. In the lead-up to the picket, Members of Parliament, LGBTQ groups, and lobbyists appealed to Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, requesting WBC be blocked from entering the UK, on the basis of it inciting hatred towards LGBT people. On February 18, 2009, two days before the intended picket date, the Home Office announced Fred Phelps and Shirley Phelps-Roper would be specifically excluded from entering the UK for having &quot;engaged in unacceptable behaviour by inciting hatred against a number of communities&quot;, and also other members &quot;could also be flagged and stopped if they tried to enter Britain&quot;.

===Other legal responses===

In 1995, Phelps Sr.&#x27;s eldest grandson, Benjamin Phelps, was convicted of assault and disorderly conduct after spitting upon the face of a passerby during a picket.

In the 1990s, WBC won a series of lawsuits against the City of Topeka and Shawnee County for efforts taken to prevent or hinder WBC picketing, and was awarded approximately $200,000 in attorney&#x27;s fees and costs associated with the litigation.

In 2004, Phelps Sr.&#x27;s daughter Margie Phelps and Margie&#x27;s son Jacob were arrested for trespassing, disorderly conduct and failure to obey after disregarding a police officer&#x27;s order during an attempted protest.

In June 2007 Shirley Phelps-Roper was arrested in Nebraska and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The arrest resulted from her allowing her ten-year-old son to step on a U.S. flag during the demonstration, which is illegal under Nebraska law. The defense contended that the child&#x27;s actions were protected speech, and that the state law is unconstitutional. The prosecution claimed the demonstration was intended as an incitement to violence, and that Phelps-Roper&#x27;s conduct might also constitute child abuse. Prosecutors later dropped charges against Phelps-Roper.

On July 14, 2006, Mundy Township, Michigan billed WBC for $5,000, after it had informed the township authorities on June 28 that a protest was planned at the Swartz Funeral Home. The bill to WBC ensued, according to the local police chief, because the organization failed to keep a verbal contract for security. Fred Phelps&#x27;s daughter claimed that the Holy Ghost had informed them not to fly to Michigan even though they had already purchased airline tickets. Security at the Webb funeral was high; 15 fire trucks were involved, as well as numerous police officers from nearby jurisdictions. The township has stated that it will not pursue the matter.

== Criticisms ==

=== Counter-protests ===

Counter-protestors have appeared at some of WBC&#x27;s protests, sometimes numbering in the hundreds or thousands.

Counter-protestors have been known to display humorous signs to mock the group. In particular, the phrase &quot;God hates figs&quot; is commonly used, in reference to Bible stories such as Jesus causing a fig tree to wither. The signs have appeared at counter-protests at the University of Chicago, in Spartanburg, South Carolina, and in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. They also appear at non-WBC-related events, such as the Rally to Restore Sanity. The use of these satirical signs has been praised by the American Civil Liberties Union and others.

Other phrases include &quot;God Hates Fred Phelps&quot;, &quot;God Hates Bags&quot;, and &quot;God Hates Shrimp&quot;. The dysfunctional Cooper family in Kevin Smith&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Red State&quot; was reportedly inspired by WBC.

=== Criticism from other Christians ===
Baptist churches, Baptist-affiliated seminaries, and Baptist conventions, including the Baptist World Alliance and the Southern Baptist Convention (two of the largest Baptist groups), have denounced WBC over the years. In addition, other mainstream Christian denominations have condemned the actions of WBC. Katherine Weber of &quot;The Christian Post&quot; states that &quot;Westboro is considered an extremist group by most mainstream Christian churches and secular groups, and is well known for its aggressive protesting style.&quot;

An alliance of six British religious groups (the Methodist Church of Great Britain, Baptist Union of Great Britain, United Reformed Church, Evangelical Alliance, Faithworks, and Bible Society-funded thinktank Theos) made a joint statement on February 19, 2009, in support of the government&#x27;s entry ban for members of WBC. They condemned the activities of WBC, stating:
Evangelist pastor Jerry Falwell Sr. referred to Fred Phelps as &quot;a first-class nut&quot;. WBC picketed Falwell&#x27;s funeral service on May 22, 2007.

In 2013, Christian rock band Five Iron Frenzy recorded a song titled &quot;God Hates Flags&quot; condemning the actions of the Westboro Baptist Church and similar organizations, including such lyrics as &quot;If God is love you got it wrong waving all your placards and flags&quot;.

=== Other criticisms ===
A number of critics have alleged that the actions of WBC are merely a ploy to receive publicity, and argue that ignoring it completely would be more effective than counter-protests.

Political commentator Bill O&#x27;Reilly frequently criticizes WBC, and has called them &quot;evil and despicable&quot;. During &quot;Snyder v. Phelps&quot;, he offered to pay Albert Snyder&#x27;s legal costs. Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has also criticized WBC. In response to WBC&#x27;s protests after the Sandy Hook shooting, rapper Mac Lethal criticized the group.

== Former members ==
Since 2004, over 20 members of WBC, mostly family members, have left the organization and the Phelps family. Several of them have accused WBC of brainwashing.

Mark Phelps, estranged son of WBC&#x27;s founder, Fred Phelps, left the organization in 1973 and began &quot;formal healing therapy in 1988 and worked toward healing and restoration, overcoming the horrible pain and fear from the 19 years of living with&quot; his father. Mark was re-baptized in a local church in 1994 and stated: &quot;If I had to take my family to court and convict them of being followers of Christ, I am not sure where I would find the evidence.&quot;

Libby Phelps-Alvarez, a granddaughter of the late Fred Phelps and daughter of Fred Phelps Jr. left WBC in 2009. In 2017, she released a book entitled &quot;Girl on a Wire: Walking the Line Between Faith and Freedom&quot;. The book documents her years in WBC and what lead up to her departure. Phelps-Alvarez is now an advocate for gay equality.

Zach Phelps-Roper is the grandson of Fred Phelps and the fourth sibling of the Phelps-Roper family to leave WBC (besides Megan and Grace mentioned below, brothers Joshua and Noah have also left). After attempting to leave the organization five times previously, he finally left in 2014 after his views began to change. He now preaches about a life of empathy and unconditional love.

Danielle Phelps, granddaughter of Fred Phelps, left the church in 2014 shortly after her grandfather&#x27;s death. She is openly gay and joined the US Marine Corps after leaving the church. In an interview with Harry Robinson on the &quot;All Out Attack Podcast&quot;, Danielle revealed that Steve Drain, father of Lauren Drain and one of the elders of the church after Fred Phelps&#x27;s death, and the rest of his family, had reportedly been excommunicated from the church.

===Nathan Phelps===
Nathan Phelps, son of Fred, left Westboro on his 18th birthday in 1976. He has stated that he never had a relationship with his abusive father when he was growing up, and that WBC is an organization for his father to &quot;vent his rage and anger.&quot; He has also stated that, in addition to hurting others, his father used to physically abuse his wife and children by beating them with his fists and with the handle of a mattock to the point of bleeding. Phelps&#x27;s brother Mark has supported and repeated Nathan&#x27;s claims of physical abuse by their father.

In March 2014, Nathan posted on Facebook that his father was in a hospice in Topeka and was near death, and that Fred was excommunicated from WBC in August 2013, for unclear reasons. These assertions were later reaffirmed by Mark Phelps. Nathan had previously predicted the organization may fall into leadership and theological crises when Fred died, because he had been the binding figure and because their beliefs hold that they are immortal, which would be disproved with the death of a member. WBC spokesperson Steve Drain denied Fred Sr. was on the verge of death and refused to confirm the reported excommunication. Fred Sr. died three days later.

=== Megan Phelps-Roper ===

Megan Phelps-Roper, a grandchild of Fred Phelps, left WBC in 2012 together with her sister Grace, and explained her reasons and experiences in a TED talk. She has written a book entitled &quot;Unfollow: A Journey from Hatred to Hope, leaving the Westboro Baptist Church.&quot; She has been making a film about her experiences and notes that four of her siblings have also left WBC.

=== Lauren Drain ===

Lauren Drain, a former member of WBC who was excommunicated in 2008, released an autobiography titled &quot;Banished&quot; in March 2013. She characterizes children, like herself, as being brainwashed into their belief system and describes consequences of questioning their belief system, such as her banishment.

==Media coverage==

In 2001, Sundance Channel aired the film &quot;A Union in Wait&quot;, a documentary about same-sex marriage directed by Ryan Butler. Phelps and members of WBC appeared in the film after Phelps picketed Wake Forest Baptist Church at Wake Forest University over a proposed same-sex union ceremony.

In 2005, the British satellite company British Sky Broadcasting produced an investigative piece using hidden cameras, which included footage of two of Phelps&#x27;s granddaughters, Libby and Jael. In the testimonial, Libby and Jael explain that they hope and pray that no one outside of Westboro becomes &quot;elect&quot;, because they want everyone else in the world to die horribly and burn in Hell, and that even if they did not believe their actions were dictated by God, they would still do and enjoy them anyway.

On April 1, 2007, British television channel BBC Two broadcast Louis Theroux&#x27;s &quot;The Most Hated Family in America&quot;. In the documentary, Theroux questioned Shirley Phelps-Roper as to whether she had considered if Westboro&#x27;s protests were more likely to &quot;put people &quot;off&quot; the Word of Jesus Christ and the Bible&quot;. In response, she said, &quot;&quot;You&quot; think our job is to win souls to Christ. All we do, by getting in their face and putting these signs in front of them and these plain words, is make what&#x27;s already in their heart come out of their mouth.&quot; Later in the documentary, Phelps-Roper agreed the $200,000 WBC annually spent to fly to funerals to protest was money spent to spread &quot;God&#x27;s hate&quot;. While being filmed by Theroux, it picketed a local appliance store because the store sold Swedish vacuum cleaners, which the group viewed as being supportive of gay people because of Swedish prosecution of Åke Green, a pastor critical of homosexuality.

The website godhatesfags.com was prominently featured in &quot;The Jeremy Kyle Show&quot;, a talk show aired on the ITV network in the United Kingdom on June 5, 2007. Shirley Phelps-Roper and her daughters had been invited to express their beliefs live via satellite. On the show, Kyle criticized the Phelpses for their beliefs and referred to the Phelps children as &quot;completely and utterly brainwashed&quot;, and to Phelps-Roper herself as &quot;deranged&quot;.

In the June 21, 2007, Channel 4 documentary &quot;Keith Allen Will Burn in Hell&quot;, starring Keith Allen, on which Phelps-Roper and some of her children agreed to appear, Phelps-Roper admitted on camera that her oldest son, Samuel, was born out of wedlock. Allen declared Phelps-Roper&#x27;s vocal condemnation of strangers having sexual congress outside of marriage to be hypocritical as she was guilty of the same thing.

Louis Theroux made a follow-up to his first documentary which was broadcast in the UK on April 3, 2011, &quot;America&#x27;s Most Hated Family in Crisis&quot;. Theroux reported that Westboro was in a state of &quot;crisis&quot; and documented the departure of several young members. Louis returned for a third documentary, &quot;Surviving America&#x27;s Most Hated Family&quot;, in 2019.

<doc id="376903" wikidata="Q311482" url="?curid=376903" title="Malik-Shah I">
<text>Malik-Shah I () was the third sultan of the Seljuk Empire from 1072 to 1092, under whom the sultanate reached the zenith of its power and influence.

During his youth, he spent his time participating in the campaigns of his father Alp Arslan, along with the latter&#x27;s vizier Nizam al-Mulk. During one such campaign in 1072, Alp Arslan was fatally wounded and died only a few days later. After that, Malik-Shah was crowned as the new sultan of the empire, but the succession was contested by his uncle Qavurt. Although Malik-Shah was the nominal head of the Seljuk state, Nizam al-Mulk held near absolute power during his reign. Malik-Shah spent the rest of his reign waging war against the Karakhanids to the east and establishing order in the Caucasus.

The cause of Malik-Shah&#x27;s death remains under dispute to this day; according to some scholars, he was poisoned by Abbasid caliph al-Muqtadi, while others say that he was poisoned by the supporters of Nizam al-Mulk.

== Etymology ==
Although he was known by several names, he was mostly known as &quot;Malik-Shah&quot;, a combination of the Arabic word malik (king) and the Persian word shah (which also means king).

== Early life ==
Malik-Shah was born on 16 August 1055 and spent his youth in Isfahan. According to the 12th-century Persian historian Muhammad bin Ali Rawandi, Malik-Shah had fair skin, was tall and somewhat bulky. In 1064, Malik-Shah, only 9 years old by then, along with Nizam al-Mulk, the Persian &quot;vizier&quot; of the Empire, took part in Alp Arslan&#x27;s campaign in the Caucasus. The same year, Malik-Shah was married to Terken Khatun, the daughter of the Karakhanid khan Ibrahim Tamghach-Khan. In 1066, Alp Arslan arranged a ceremony near Merv, where he appointed Malik-Shah as his heir and also granted him Isfahan as a fief.

In 1071, Malik-Shah took part in the Syrian campaign of his father, and stayed in Aleppo when his father fought the Byzantine emperor Romanos IV Diogenes at Manzikert. In 1072, Malik-Shah and Nizam al-Mulk accompanied Alp-Arslan during his campaign in Transoxiana against the Karakhanids. However, Alp-Arslan was badly wounded during his expedition, and Malik-Shah shortly took over the army. Alp-Arslan died some days later, and Malik-Shah was declared as the new &quot;sultan&quot; of the empire.

==Reign==
=== War of succession ===
However, right after Malik-Shah&#x27;s accession, his uncle Qavurt claimed the throne for himself and sent Malik-Shah a message which said: &quot;I am the eldest brother, and you are a youthful son; I have the greater right to my brother Alp-Arslan&#x27;s inheritance.&quot; Malik-Shah then replied by sending the following message: &quot;A brother does not inherit when there is a son.&quot; This message enraged Qavurt, who thereafter occupied Isfahan. In 1073 a battle took place near Hamadan, which lasted three days. Qavurt was accompanied by his seven sons, and his army consisted of Turkmens, while the army of Malik-Shah consisted of &quot;ghulams&quot; (&quot;military slaves&quot;) and contingents of Kurdish and Arab troops.

During the battle, the Turks of Malik-Shah&#x27;s army mutinied against him, but he nevertheless managed to defeat and capture Qavurt. Qavurt then begged for mercy and in return promised to retire to Oman. However, Nizam al-Mulk declined the offer, claiming that sparing him was an indication of weakness. After some time, Qavurt was strangled to death with a bowstring, while two of his sons were blinded. After having dealt with that problem, Malik-Shah appointed Qutlugh-Tegin as the governor of Fars and Sav-Tegin as the governor of Kerman.

=== Warfare with Karakhanids ===
Malik-Shah then turned his attention towards the Karakhanids, who had after the death of Alp-Arslan invaded Tukharistan, which was ruled by Malik-Shah&#x27;s brother Ayaz, who was unable to repel the Karakhanids and was killed by them. Malik-Shah eventually managed to repel the Karakhanids and captured Tirmidh, giving Sav-Tegin the key of the city. Malik-Shah then appointed his other brother Shihab al-Din Tekish as the ruler of Tukharistan and Balkh. During the same period, the Ghaznavid ruler Ibrahim was seizing Seljuk territory in northern Khorasan, but was defeated by Malik-Shah, who then made peace with the latter and gave his daughter Gawhar Khatun in marriage to Ibrahim&#x27;s son Mas&#x27;ud III.

=== Other wars ===
In 1074, Malik-Shah ordered the Turkic warlord Arghar to restore what he had destroyed during his raids in the territory of the Shirvanshah Fariburz I. During the same year, he appointed Qavurt&#x27;s son Rukn al-Dawla Sultan-Shah as the ruler of Kerman. One year later, Malik-Shah sent an army under Sav-Tegin to Arran, which was ruled by the Shaddadid ruler Fadlun III. Sav-Tegin managed to easily conquer the region, thus ending Shaddadid rule. Malik-Shah then gave Gorgan to Fadlun III as a fief. Throughout Malik&#x27;s reign new institutions of learning were established and it was during this time that the Jalali calendar was reformed at the Isfahan observatory. In 1086–87, he led an expedition to capture Edessa, Manbij, Aleppo, Antioch and Latakia. During this expedition, he appointed Aq Sunqur governor of Aleppo and received homage of the Arab emir of Shaizar, Nasir ibn Ali ibn Munquidh. In 1089, Malik-Shah captured Samarkand with the support of the local clergy, and imprisoned its Karakhanid ruler Ahmad Khan ibn Khizr, who was the nephew of Terken Khatun. He then marched to Semirechye, and made the Karakhanid Harun Khan ibn Sulayman, the ruler of Kashgar and Khotan, acknowledge him as his suzerain.

=== Domestic policy and Ismailis ===

In 1092, Nizam al-Mulk was assassinated near Sihna, on the road to Baghdad, by a man disguised as a Sufi. As the assassin was immediately cut down by Nizam&#x27;s bodyguard, it became impossible to establish with certainty who had sent him. One theory had it that he was an Assassin, since these assassins regularly made attempts on the lives of Seljuk officials and rulers during the 11th century. Another theory had it that the attack had been instigated by Malik-Shah, who may have grown tired of his overmighty vizier. After Nizam al-Mulk&#x27;s death, Malik-Shah appointed another Persian named Taj al-Mulk Abu&#x27;l Ghana&#x27;im as his vizier. Malik-Shah then went to Baghdad and decided to depose al-Muqtadi and sent him the following message: &quot;You must relinquish Baghdad to me, and depart to any land you choose.&quot; This was because Malik-Shah wanted to appoint his grandson (or nephew) Ja&#x27;far as the new caliph.

The Sultan had a good relationship with the Shias at large except for the Ismailis of Hassan ibn Sabbah. Followers of Sabbah managed to occupy the Alamut fortress near Qazvin, and the army under the command of the emir Arslan-Tash, sent by Malik Shah, could not recapture it. The Sultan&#x27;s ghilman, Kizil Sarug, besieged the Daru fortress in Kuhistan, but ceased hostilities in connection with the death of Malik Shah on November 19, 1092, possibly due to poisoning.

== Death and aftermath ==
Malik-Shah died on 19 November 1092 while he was hunting. He was most likely poisoned by the caliph or the supporters of Nizam al-Mulk. Under the orders of Terken Khatun, Malik-Shah&#x27;s body was taken back to Isfahan, where it was buried in a madrasa.

Upon his death, the Seljuk Empire fell into chaos, as rival successors and regional governors carved up their empire and waged war against each other. The situation within the Seljuk lands was further complicated by the beginning of the First Crusade, which detached large portions of Syria and Palestine from Muslim control in 1098 and 1099. The success of the First Crusade is at least in part attributable to the political confusion which resulted from Malik-Shah&#x27;s death.

==Family==
Malikshah had many wives and concubines and multiple children born from them. Principal wives were:

# Terken Khatun (b. 1053, m. 1065. d. 1094) – daughter of Tamghach Khan Ibrahim
#* Dawud (d. 1082)

==Legacy==
The 18th century English historian Edward Gibbon wrote of him:
==Personality==
Malik-Shah displayed substantial interest in science, art and literature. The Isfahan Observatory or Malikshah Observatory was constructed during his reign, closing shortly after his death in 1092. It was from the work at the observatory that the Jalali Calendar was adopted. He thought highly of the art of architecture as well, as he enjoyed building new and splendid mosques in his capital, Isfahan. He was religiously tolerant which is supported by the fact that during his reign, subjects of the Seljuk Empire enjoyed internal peace and religious tolerance. Malik-Shah also showed lenience towards exquisite poetry as his reign is also memorable for the poetry of Omar Khayyam.

Despite being arguably the most powerful monarch of his era, it is believed that Malik-Shah was unpretentious and modest. The legend has it that during the years that were hugely successful for Seljuks on all fronts, Malik-Shah, overwhelmed by the imperial might of his dynasty, used to climb to the top of a hill and say the following: &quot;Oh Almighty God, I will somehow cope with the problem of hunger, please save me from the threat of abundance&quot;.

Malik Shah did not spend as much time on campaign as his prominent predecessor Tughril or his father Alp Arslan did. Isfahan became securely established as his chief city of residence, although in the latter years of his rule Malik Shah preferred to winter in Baghdad. Whereas Alp Arslan had spent just over a year out of his decade-long reign in Isfahan, Malik Shah resided there for more than half of his rule. Isfahan also served as the burial site of Malik Shah, his descendants, as well as celebrated bureaucrats of the sultanate like Nizam al-Mulk. Malik Shah&#x27;s decision of residing in a capital far away from the centers of Turkmen settlement around Merv, Rayy, Hamadan, and Azerbaijan could well be explained by the increasing distance between him and his nomadic subjects.
