<text>Sanation (, ) was a Polish political movement that emerged in the interwar period, prior to Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s May 1926 &quot;Coup d&#x27;État&quot;, and gained influence following the coup. In 1928, its political activists went on to form the Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government (&quot;BBWR&quot;).

The Sanation movement took its name from Piłsudski&#x27;s goal of a moral &quot;sanation&quot; (healing) of the Polish body politic. The movement functioned cohesively until Piłsudski&#x27;s death in 1935. Following his death, Sanation fragmented into several factions, including &quot;the Castle&quot; (President Ignacy Mościcki and his supporters). 

Sanation, which supported authoritarian rule, was led by a circle of Piłsudski&#x27;s close associates, including Walery Sławek, Aleksander Prystor, Kazimierz Świtalski, Janusz Jędrzejewicz, Adam Koc, Józef Beck, Tadeusz Hołówko, Bogusław Miedziński, and Edward Śmigły-Rydz. It emphasized the primacy of the national interest in governance, and opposed the system of parliamentary democracy.

==Background==
Named after the Latin word for &quot;healing&quot; (&quot;sanatio&quot;), the Sanation movement mainly consisted of former military officers who were dissatisfied with the perceived corruption in Polish politics. Sanation was a coalition of rightists, leftists, and centrists, primarily focused on addressing corruption and reducing inflation. The movement emerged prior to the May 1926 &quot;Coup d&#x27;État&quot; and persisted until the onset of World War II, but was never formalized. While Piłsudski had previously led the Polish Socialist Party, he grew disillusioned with political parties, which he viewed as promoting their own interests rather than those of the state and the people. As a result, the Sanation movement did not evolve into a political party. Instead, in 1928, Sanation members formed the &quot;Bezpartyjny Blok Współpracy z Rządem&quot; (&quot;BBWR&quot;, &quot;Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government&quot;), a pro-government group that did not consider itself a political party.

==History==

Although Piłsudski never sought personal power, he exercised considerable influence over Polish politics after Sanation came to power in 1926. For the next decade, he played a central role in Polish affairs as the de facto leader of a generally popular centrist regime. Kazimierz Bartel&#x27;s government and all subsequent governments were informally approved by Piłsudski before being confirmed by the President. In his pursuit of &quot;sanation,&quot; Piłsudski combined democratic and authoritarian elements. Poland&#x27;s internal stability improved, and economic stagnation was addressed through Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski&#x27;s economic reforms. At the same time, the Sanation regime took action against communist parties (citing formal grounds that they had failed to legally &quot;register&quot; as political parties) and worked to limit the influence of opposition parties by fragmenting their support. A notable feature of the regime was that, unlike in many non-democratic European countries, it did not evolve into a full dictatorship. Freedom of the press, speech, and political parties was never legally abolished, and opposition figures were often dealt with through means other than formal court sentences, such as actions by &quot;unidentified perpetrators.&quot;

Sanation allowed the 1928 election to be relatively free, but faced a setback when its &quot;BBWR&quot; supporters fell short of securing a majority. Prior to the 1930 election, some opposition parties united in a &quot;Centrolew&quot; (Center-Left) coalition, calling for the government&#x27;s overthrow; in response, Sanation arrested more than 20 prominent opposition leaders from the &quot;Centrolew&quot; movement. In the subsequent election, &quot;BBWR&quot; won over 46 percent of the vote and secured a large majority in both houses of parliament. The personality cult surrounding Józef Piłsudski was largely a result of his general popularity with the public, rather than through top-down propaganda, which is notable given Piłsudski&#x27;s skepticism of democracy. Sanation&#x27;s ideology focused primarily on populist calls for political and economic reform, but did not delve into societal issues in the manner of contemporary fascist regimes. From 1929, the semi-official newspaper of Sanation, and thus of the Polish government, was &quot;Gazeta Polska&quot; (the &quot;Polish Gazette&quot;).

==Legislative agenda==
The Sanation government invalidated the results of the May 1930 election by disbanding the parliament in August. New elections were scheduled for November 1930. In response to anti-government demonstrations, 20 opposition-party members, including most of the leaders of the &quot;Centrolew&quot; alliance (Socialist, Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot;, and Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Wyzwolenie&quot; leaders) were arrested in September 1930 without warrants, on the orders of Piłsudski and the Minister of Internal Security, Felicjan Sławoj Składkowski, and accused of plotting an anti-government coup.

The opposition leaders (including former prime minister Wincenty Witos and Wojciech Korfanty) were imprisoned and tried at the Brest Fortress (which led to the popular name for the November 1930 election: &quot;the Brest election&quot;). A number of lesser-known political activists across the country were also arrested; they were released after the election. The Brest trial concluded in January 1932, with ten of the accused sentenced to up to three years&#x27; imprisonment; appeals in 1933 upheld the sentences. The government offered those sentenced the option of emigrating abroad; five chose this option, while the other five decided to serve their prison terms.

== Splintering and power-sharing ==
A key turning point for the Piłsudskiites occurred in 1935 with Piłsudski&#x27;s death. The April 1935 Constitution, adopted a few weeks earlier, had been designed with Marshal Piłsudski in mind. In the absence of a successor with similar authority, a reinterpretation of the new Constitution became necessary. As Ignacy Matuszewski stated, &quot;We must replace the Great Man with an organization.&quot;

Piłsudski&#x27;s death led to the fragmentation of Sanation, driven by two main factors: competition for power and influence among Piłsudski&#x27;s followers (the struggles among the &quot;diadochi&quot; – &quot;the heirs&quot; – as Adam Pragier referred to them); and a search for a more suitable ideology that Piłsudski&#x27;s supporters might accept. The combination of personal competition and differing ideological views resulted in division and a lack of unity.

Eventually, Sanation divided into three major factions:

* &quot;the Colonels&quot; (&quot;Pułkownicy&quot;, gathered around Walery Sławek), which sought to continue the Piłsudskiite ideology in alignment with the principles of the April Constitution;
* &quot;the Castle&quot; (&quot;Zamek&quot;, formed around President Ignacy Mościcki, who resided in the Warsaw Castle, which gave the faction its name); and
* &quot;GISZ&quot; (&quot;Generalny Inspektor Sił Zbrojnych&quot;), formed around General Inspector of the Armed Forces Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz as a representative of the late Marshal Piłsudski.

The document deviated from the state order established by the April Constitution.

Another outcome of the Mościcki-Śmigły agreement was the promotion of the general to Marshal of Poland. On November 10, 1936, President Mościcki appointed him General of the branch and, at the same time, Marshal of Poland, and decorated him with the Order of the White Eagle.

Additionally, the creation of the Camp of National Unity (OZN) under Śmigły’s direction and within his framework expanded his influence. As a result, he became the central figure in determining the ideological direction of Sanation from 1937 to 1939.

Piłsudski&#x27;s death led to a power struggle, as is often the case in such circumstances. At the same time, there were increasing differences in political thought among the Piłsudskiites. The Colonels&#x27; group and Sławek lost influence, and with them, the concepts of a socialized state and the Constitution as the sole regulator of state life. A new authority emerged in the figure of Śmigły-Rydz, largely supported by some former Colonels. This new group, centered around the General Inspector, took a nationalistic direction, and at times exhibited pro-totalitarian tendencies. The Castle Group and the “&quot;Naprawa&quot;” group, based around the president, sought to moderate these tendencies. The Sanation left, weak among the Piłsudskiites, effectively distanced itself from the camp.

==World War II==
During the 1939 invasion of Poland, many Sanationists evacuated to Romania or Hungary, from where they were able to travel to France or French-mandated Syria and, after the fall of France, to Britain. Although France sought to exclude Sanationists from the Polish Government in Exile, many continued to maintain influence. During the war, Sanationists established several resistance organizations, including in 1942 the Polish Fighting Movement (&quot;Obóz Polski Walczącej&quot;), which in 1943 became subordinate to the Home Army and in 1944 merged with the Council of Independence Organizations (&quot;Konwent Organizacji Niepodległościowych&quot;) to form the Union of Independence Organizations (&quot;Zjednoczenie Organizacji Niepodległościowych&quot;). After World War II, Poland&#x27;s Soviet-installed communist government labeled Sanationists as enemies of the state, leading to executions or forced exile for many.

<text>Dendrology (, &quot;dendron&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;; and , &quot;-logia&quot;, &quot;science of&quot; or &quot;study of&quot;) or [[xylology]] (, &quot;ksulon&quot;, &quot;wood&quot;) is the science and study of woody plants (trees, shrubs, and lianas), specifically, their taxonomic classifications. There is no sharp boundary between plant taxonomy and dendrology; woody plants not only belong to many different plant families, but these families may be made up of both woody and non-woody members. Some families include only a few woody species. Dendrology, as a discipline of industrial forestry, tends to focus on identification of economically useful woody plants and their taxonomic interrelationships. As an academic course of study, dendrology will include all woody plants, native and non-native, that occur in a region. A related discipline is the study of sylvics, which focuses on the autecology of genera and species.

In the past, dendrology included the study of the natural history of woody species in specific regions, but this aspect is now considered part of ecology. The field also plays a role in conserving rare or endangered species.

== Relationship with botany ==

Dendrology is a branch of botany that specializes in the characterization and identification of woody plants, while botany is the study of all types of general plants.

<text>The Science Council is a UK organisation that was established by Royal Charter in 2003. The principal activity of The Science Council is the promotion of the advancement and dissemination of knowledge of and education in science pure and applied, for the public benefit. The Science Council is the Competent Authority with respect to the European Union directive 2005/36/EC. It is a membership organisation for learned and professional bodies across science and its applications and works with them to represent this sector to government and others. Together, the member organisations represent over 350,000 scientists. The Science Council provides a forum for discussion and exchange of views and works to foster collaboration between member organisations and the wider science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medical communities to enable inter-disciplinary contributions to science policy and the application of science.

== History Timeline ==
The Science Council was founded in 2003 by the late Professor Sir Gareth Roberts FRS, who served as the council&#x27;s Founding President. In February 2007, Sir Tom McKillop FRS, became the President of the Science Council and he was succeeded in June 2011 by Professor Sir Tom Blundell, and then by Professor Sir Keith Burnett FRS in June 2016. In May 2021 Professor Carole Mundell was appointed the new president.

In November 2008 the Science Council launched Future Morph, a website aimed at providing children, parents, teachers and the general public with information about science and how it might help in future careers.

In 2015 an amended Charter was granted a Privy Council seal.

==Purpose==
The Science Council&#x27;s charitable purpose as stated in its 2015 Royal Charter is &quot;to promote the advancement and dissemination of knowledge of and education in science, pure and applied, for the public benefit.&quot;

To fulfil this purpose, the Science Council advances professionalism in science through the professional registration of scientists and technicians who meet a high professional standard and competence and follow an established code of conduct.

The Science Council&#x27;s Royal Charter also defines its role as an umbrella organisation, providing a forum to connect members for discussion and information exchange. 

The Science Council provides member bodies with a forum to raise standards through sharing practice and knowledge, and to hold each other to account through a peer-review approach. A successful example of this approach is the recent Diversity, Equality and Inclusion programme of work.

== Designations ==
The Science Council promotes the profession and contribution of science and scientists through the Chartered Scientist (CSci), Registered Scientist (RSci), Registered Science Technician (RSciTech) and Chartered Science Teacher (CSciTech) designations and the development of codes of practice.

Chartered Science Teacher was launched in 2004. Registered Science Technician and Registered Scientist were launched in October 2011 alongside the Chartered Scientist award, to build a framework of professional standards and recognition across the science workforce

<doc id="374969" wikidata="Q632812" url="?curid=374969" title="Vincent Astor">
<text>William Vincent Astor (November 15, 1891 – February 3, 1959) was an American businessman, philanthropist, and member of the prominent Astor family.

==Early life==
Called Vincent, he was born in New York City on November 15, 1891. Astor was the elder child of John Jacob Astor IV, a wealthy businessman and inventor, and his first wife, Ava Lowle Willing, an heiress from Philadelphia.

He graduated in 1910 from St. George&#x27;s School in Middletown, Rhode Island, and attended Harvard College from 1911 to 1912, leaving school without graduating. In 1912 Vincent Astor&#x27;s father, John Jacob Astor IV died on the &quot;Titanic&quot; and left him the biggest fortune at that time and made Vincent Astor one of the richest people in the world.

==Interests==

Like his father, Astor belonged to the New York Society of Colonial Wars. Having joined the U.S. Naval Reserve Force prior to America&#x27;s entry to the First World War, he was called to active duty on April 7, 1917, and was later promoted to Lieutenant. As executive officer aboard the armed yacht USS &quot;Aphrodite&quot; he saw service escorting convoys and was aboard when she struck a mine on January 10, 1919. Subsequently, Astor was made commodore of the New York Yacht Club from 1928 to 1930.

Astor was interested in trains. In the early 1930s, he established an estate in Bermuda which included a private narrow-gauge railway and union station with the Bermuda Railway. The estate is now divided among several private owners, none of whom are part of the Astor family. As recently as 1992, the remains of some of his rolling stock were visible.

In 1937, Astor became the chairman and chief stockholder of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine. From 1940 to 1959, the magazine was headquartered at the Knickerbocker Building, built by his father. Astor remained the principal owner until his 1959 death. Two years later, The Washington Post Company purchased a controlling stake (59%) of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine from the Vincent Astor Foundation for $8 million.

==Philanthropy==
Vincent Astor was, according to family biographer Derek Wilson, &quot;a hitherto unknown phenomenon in America: an Astor with a highly developed social conscience.&quot; He was 20 when his father died in the sinking of the ocean liner &quot;Titanic&quot; and, having inherited a massive fortune, he dropped out of Harvard University. He set out to change the family&#x27;s image from that of miserly, aloof slum landlords who enjoyed the good life at the expense of others.

Over time, he sold off the family&#x27;s New York City slum housing and reinvested in reputable enterprises, while spending a great deal of time and energy helping others. He was responsible for the construction of a large housing complex in the Bronx that included sufficient land for a large children&#x27;s playground, and in Harlem, he transformed a valuable piece of real estate into another playground for children.

Astor appeared at No. 12 on the first list of America&#x27;s richest people, compiled by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. His net worth at the time was estimated at $75 million. 
He also inherited Ferncliff, the Astor family&#x27;s estate in Rhinebeck, New York, where his father had been born. However, Vincent Astor would be the last Astor family member to own the estate as well as the final Astor to occupy the &quot;Ferncliff Casino&quot;, a Stanford White-designed 1904 Beaux-Arts style building, which was inspired by the Grand Trianon at Versailles.

On his death in 1959, Astor bequeathed a main house at Ferncliff to the Benedictine Hospital in Kingston, New York. His widow, Brooke, later donated the &quot;Ferncliff Casino&quot; to the Catholic Archdiocese of New York and sold off many parcels of the estate. In 1963, Homer Staley, a retired businessman in the area, asked Brooke Astor to preserve the remaining natural acreage of woodlands from development. She donated the woodlands to the Rotary Club of Rhinebeck, and the land became the Ferncliff Forest Game Refuge and Forest Preserve.

===The Sinclair-Astor Letters===
Upton Sinclair, author of &quot;The Jungle&quot;, wrote Astor an open letter, which he describes in &quot;The Brass Check&quot; and he also sent to over half a dozen newspapers, requesting that he support the Socialist cause and help the poor, at a time when Sinclair claims Astor was erecting a million dollar estate, without benefiting the rest of society; the only newspaper to publish his letter was a Socialist newspaper, the &quot;New York Call&quot;. Vincent Astor replied to this letter, and also sent a copy out to over half a dozen newspapers, and according to Sinclair, all of them published his reply in full, including the &quot;New York Call&quot;. Sinclair claimed this was what he considered a scientific demonstration of bias of the media in favor of the wealthy because they gave Astor complete coverage, often on the front page, and, except for the &quot;Call&quot;, they declined to publish his first letter, and only three of the traditional newspapers published a small portion of his reply to Astor&#x27;s letter, without featuring it as prominently.

==Marriages==

Astor married Helen Dinsmore Huntington on April 30, 1914. At the ceremony, he was stricken with the mumps, a disease that made him sterile; as for the bride, her friend Glenway Wescott, the novelist, admiringly described her in his unpublished diaries as &quot;a grand, old-fashioned lesbian.&quot; The couple divorced in 1940. A year later, Helen became the second wife of Lytle Hull (1882–1958), a real-estate broker who was a friend and business associate of her former husband.

Shortly after his divorce, Astor married Mary Benedict Cushing, the eldest daughter of Dr. Harvey Williams Cushing and Katharine Stone Crowell. Mary&#x27;s sisters—the trio were collectively known as the &quot;Cushing Sisters&quot;—were Betsey Maria Cushing and Barbara &quot;Babe&quot; Cushing. Astor and Cushing divorced in September 1953, and the following month, Cushing wed James Whitney Fosburgh, a painter who worked as an art lecturer at the Frick Museum.

On October 8, 1953, several weeks after divorcing his second wife, Astor married the once-divorced, once-widowed Roberta Brooke Russell. According to an often-told story in society circles, Astor agreed to divorce his second wife only after she had found him a replacement spouse. Her first suggestion was Janet Newbold Ryan Stewart Bush, the newly divorced wife of James Smith Bush II, who turned Astor down with startling candor, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t even like you.&quot; Astor proceeded to tell her that he was not well and, though only in his early 60s, he could not be expected to live for very long, whereupon she would inherit his millions. At that, Janet Bush reportedly replied, &quot;What if you do live?&quot;. Mary Cushing then proposed Brooke. Together, Vincent and Brooke developed the Vincent Astor Foundation, a foundation that was designed to give back to New York City. Brooke died in 2007 at the age of 105.

==Wartime service in the United States Navy==

===World War I===
Astor joined the Naval Reserve shortly after it was founded and was commissioned as an ensign on December 28, 1915. He was called to active duty as part of the New York Naval Militia in February 1917 by order of Governor Charles S. Whitman to help guard bridges and aqueducts against possible German sabotage. Astor was assigned to help guard the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges.

Following the declaration of war against Germany, Astor took advice from his friend and future president Franklin Delano Roosevelt and volunteered for active duty with the Navy on April 7, 1917. He went overseas on June 9 on the USS &quot;Noma&quot; (Astor&#x27;s own yacht which had been acquired as a patrol ship by the Navy). He was later assigned to the armed yacht USS &quot;Aphrodite&quot;.

He was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on January 1, 1918, and to lieutenant on July 1, 1918. He was joined in France by his wife, who did charity work with the YMCA at the naval base in Bordeaux, while he served as Port Officer at Royan.

His last assignment was as an officer on the captured German minelaying submarine &quot;U-117&quot; during her voyage to the United States. Astor returned to the United States on the &quot;U-117&quot; on April 25, 1919, and was discharged on May 24.

After the war, Astor became a companion of the Naval Order of the United States.

===World War II===

In the quiet before the war, Astor sailed the &quot;Nourmahal&quot; in 1938 to Japan on a secret civilian mission for President Franklin D. Roosevelt to gather intelligence on the Japanese naval operations around the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. As he had done with the &quot;Noma&quot; in the First World War, he lent his yacht &quot;Nourmahal&quot; to the Coast Guard for service in the Second World War.

In World War II, Astor again served on active duty with the Navy. He was called to active duty with the rank of commander and given assignment as Area Controller for New York. In this position he coordinated merchant convoys leaving the city and provided informal intelligence work for President Roosevelt.

Perhaps Astor&#x27;s longer lasting contributions were his weekly reports from the Chase Bank, where his inside access included USSR account balances. On December 13, 1940, Astor began reporting to the US Treasury the Soviet weekly balances in an unbroken sequence (made by occasional substitutes) up through at least 1945.

During the early months of 1942, Astor suggested equipping fishing boats with radios so they could report U-boat sightings. One boat so equipped was Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s fishing yacht &quot;Pilar&quot;.

In June 1943, he was promoted to the rank of captain (with date of rank June 18, 1942).

For his service in the Navy, Captain Astor was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal, Naval Reserve Medal with star, World War I Victory Medal, American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, and World War II Victory Medal.

==Death==
Vincent Astor died on February 3, 1959, of a heart attack in his apartment at 120 East End Avenue in Manhattan. He left all of his money to the Vincent Astor Foundation, with Brooke surprising many. She continued his philanthropic work.

Astor was first interred at his &quot;Ferncliff Casino&quot; estate (&quot;Astor Courts&quot;) along the Hudson River in Rhinebeck, New York. The home included an indoor tennis pavilion, two squash courts, and the country&#x27;s first indoor heated pool. When Brooke Astor later disposed of the property, he was reinterred in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. Brooke is buried next to him.

His half-brother John Jacob Astor VI, known as &quot;Jakey&quot;, felt cheated and resentfully stated that Vincent &quot;had the legal, not the moral right to keep all the money&quot;. Jakey sued Brooke to inherit his money. He was certain that Vincent was &quot;mentally incompetent&quot; when signing his last will in June 1958 due to frequent smoking and alcoholism, although Brooke insisted otherwise. While Vincent was hospitalized, Brooke often brought him liquor. Jakey accused her of using the liquor to influence the will in her favor. Jakey ended up settling for $250,000. The rest of the money remained with the Vincent Astor Foundation and Brooke.

==Mount Astor==
A mountain in Antarctica bears Astor&#x27;s name. Rising to a height of 3,710 m, Mount Astor is located in the Hays Mountains of the Queen Maud Range, and was named by Rear Admiral Richard Byrd on his November 1929 expedition flight to the South Pole. Astor had been a contributing philanthropist to the expedition.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Shipwrights is one of the ancient livery companies of the City of London. 

Although the Shipwrights&#x27; Company is no longer a shipbuilding trade association representing solely London-based industry, through its membership it retains strong links with global trade, and and shipping professions.

The Company ranks fifty-ninth in the City livery order of precedence and is based at Ironmongers&#x27; Hall, where it cohabits with the Ironmongers&#x27; Company.

Its motto is &quot;Within The Ark Safe For Ever&quot;.

==History of establishment==
The Shipwrights&#x27; Company, unlike other livery companies, has not received a Royal Charter because maritime trade by definition was never confined within the boundaries of the Square Mile; instead a corporate body of London shipwrights grew over time, their first recorded reference being in the twelfth century; thus the Company&#x27;s status is considered as being incorporated &quot;by prescription&quot;.

By contrast a Royal Charter &quot;was&quot; issued in 1612 to the &quot;Master, Wardens, and Commonalty of the Art or Mystery of Shipwrights of Redriff (&quot;ie.&quot; Rotherhithe) in the County of Surrey&quot;. This led to a dispute about jurisdiction between the two companies, being resolved in 1684 when the &quot;Rotherhithe charter&quot; was cancelled.

The Shipwrights&#x27; Company received confirmation of its City of London livery status in 1782.

==Membership==
Ever since Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign the Company continues to enjoy a special connection with the Royal Family, several of whom are liverymen today; Having served on the Court of Assistants since 1986, Prince Charles was installed on 10 May 2011 as Prime Warden for 2011/12, before succeeding his father, Lord High Admiral HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as Permanent Master Shipwright on 16 February 2012. Prince Philip was elected Prime Warden Shipwright (for 1954/55) and became the Company&#x27;s longest-serving Permanent Master (1955–2012). King Charles III succeeded his mother as Patron in 2024, when the Shipwrights&#x27; Permanent Mastership merged with the Crown.

Whilst sons and daughters of members can join as freemen of the Company, only those with a professional maritime background (military or commercial) may become liverymen. The Company supports maritime research, numerous charities, as well as the work of the Lord Mayor of London, the City of London Corporation and the Sheriffs of the City of London. The Company is also involved in charitable educational activities, which includes the support of the London Nautical School and George Green&#x27;s School in London.

The current Clerk to the Shipwrights&#x27; Company is Lt-Col. Richard Cole-Mackintosh, whose role combines that of executive officer as well as supporting the Prime Warden: Simon Beale (for 2024/25).

The Company&#x27;s Honorary Chaplain is the Revd Canon Bill Christianson.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London, UK.

The company was founded by a Royal Charter of Charles I in 1629 AD; it was granted the status of a Livery Company in 1809. The company was empowered to set regulations and standards for optical devices; this was eroded by the Industrial Revolution, after which mechanical advancements made trade restrictions difficult to enforce.

==F.S.M.C. credential==
The company acquired the right, however, to set examinations that opticians had to pass before practising. The opticians that passed the examinations were designated F.S.M.C. and this credential stood for Fellowship in Optometry of the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers.

==British College of Ophthalmic Opticians==
This power was surrendered to the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (now titled the College of Optometrists) in 1979, who took over the examination of optometrists, and in 1986 power of examination for dispensing opticians was surrendered to the Association of British Dispensing Opticians (ABDO).

==Association of British Dispensing Opticians==
In 1986, the power of examination for dispensing opticians was surrendered to the Association of British Dispensing Opticians (ABDO).

Now, the Spectacle Makers&#x27; Company is a thriving membership organisation working across vision care and sight loss. There are over 900 members in 17 different countries. The Spectacle Makers&#x27; Charity (registered Charity in England and Wales no.1186122 supports charities improving the quality of life for people with impaired vision, as well as research in the field of optics and bursaries for aspiring optical technicians, orthoptists, optometrists, dispensing opticians, ophthalmic nurses and optical imaging professionals. 
The Spectacle Makers&#x27; Company ranks sixtieth in the order of precedence for Livery Companies.

<doc id="374975" wikidata="Q2594052" url="?curid=374975" title="Worshipful Company of Clockmakers">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers was established under a Royal Charter granted by King Charles I in 1631. It ranks sixty-first among the livery companies of the City of London, and comes under the jurisdiction of the Privy Council. The company established a library and its museum in 1813, which is the oldest specific collection of clocks and watches worldwide. This is administered by the company&#x27;s affiliated charity, the Clockmakers&#x27; Charity, and is presently housed on the second floor of London&#x27;s Science Museum. The modern aims of the company and its museum are charitable and educational, in particular to promote and preserve clockmaking and watchmaking, which as of 2019 were added to the HCA Red List of Endangered Crafts.

The Clockmakers&#x27; Museum, comprising a collection of clocks, watches, portraits and ephemera is housed in a new gallery provided by the Science Museum, officially opened by Princess Anne on 22 October 2015. The museum was first established in 1813, and was housed at London&#x27;s Guildhall from 1874 to 2014. It claims to be the oldest collection specifically of watches and clocks in the world. Though the collection is now housed in the Clockmakers&#x27; Museum in South Kensington, the company&#x27;s archive and library are however still kept at Guildhall Library. The museum collection includes John Harrison&#x27;s sea watch H5, once personally tested by King George III.

==Motto==
The company&#x27;s motto, &quot;Tempus Rerum Imperator&quot;, can be translated as ‘Time, the Ruler of All Things’. It appears as an epitaph on the tombstone of former British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, a liveryman of the company.

==History==
Prior to the seventeenth century, clockmaking by native English craftsmen was mostly confined to the production of turret clocks. Domestic clocks and watches were mostly imported or the work of immigrants from the European continent. Because turret clock making involved working in ferrous metal, clockmakers within the City of London tended to be freemen of the Blacksmiths’ Company, though some were members of other livery companies, notably the Clothworkers.

After the loss of many London clock and watchmakers in the plagues of 1598 and 1603, the trade consolidated and began to grow. The continued influx of newcomers led to resentment from those who had become established in London towards outsiders who came to set up in or near the City and who threatened their market. From 1620 onwards, groups of clockmakers attempted to set up their own guild. The Blacksmiths initially succeeded in opposing these moves. Eventually, however, with the king issuing charters as a means of raising much needed finance at a time when he had prorogued Parliament, the clockmakers succeeded in securing a royal charter, on 22 August 1631, to the distress of the Blacksmiths, who could naturally expect to lose members, and therefore income.

The charter gave regulatory authority to the Clockmakers to control the horological trade in the City of London and for a radius of ten miles around. It incorporated a controlling body which should have ‘continuance for ever under the style and name of The Master, Wardens and Fellowship of the Art and Mystery of Clockmaking’. It provided that the fellowship should be governed by a master, three wardens and ten or more assistants who would form the Court. The first master was David Ramsay, a Scot, who had been appointed watchmaker to James VI of Scotland, later James I of England. The noted clockmaker Edward East also formed part of the first court.

The original charter is still in the company&#x27;s possession and is housed with the rest of its library and archive in the Guildhall Library. The company obtained a grant of arms from the College of Arms in January 1672. In 1766, the Court of Aldermen granted the company its livery. The number of liverymen was originally limited at sixty but has been increased in number over the years by approval of the City of London Corporation and currently stands at a maximum of three hundred.

==Horological Training and Awards for Excellence==
The company bestows three awards for excellence: the Tompion Medal for outstanding achievements in horology, the Harrison Medal for the propagation of horological knowledge and its appreciation, and the Derek Pratt Prize for innovation, ingenuity, elegance, and the highest standards of workmanship and precision performance in the craft and science of time and timekeeping. The company also closely co-operates with the trustees of the George Daniels Educational Trust in supporting education in horology.

==Affiliations==
The Clockmakers Company is formally affiliated with the Antiquarian Horological Society, the UCL Observatory, HMS &quot;Protector&quot;, the Royal Navy&#x27;s Ice Patrol Ship, HMS &quot;Archer&quot;, a P264 Class University Royal Naval Unit based in Edinburgh, and XIII Squadron RAF.

<doc id="374977" wikidata="Q2089045" url="?curid=374977" title="Disc tumbler lock">
<text>A disc tumbler or disc detainer lock is a lock composed of slotted rotating detainer discs. The lock was invented by Finnish founder of Abloy, Emil Henriksson (1886–1959) in 1907 and first manufactured under the Abloy brand in 1918.

==Design==
Disc tumbler locks are composed of slotted rotating detainer discs. A specially cut key rotates these discs like the tumblers of a safe to align the slots, allowing the sidebar to drop into the slots, thus opening the lock. Unlike a wafer tumbler lock or a pin tumbler lock, this mechanism does not use springs. Because they do not contain springs, they are better suited for areas with harsh conditions and are often used at outdoor locations like railroad and public utility installations.

The original Abloy Classic design consists of a notched semi-cylindrical key, and a lock with detainer discs with holes ranging from a semicircle (180°) to a 3/4 circle (270°). The key is inserted and rotated 90°. Notches, machined to an angle, correspond to complementary angles in the holes of the discs. Thus, the misalignment of the slots is &quot;corrected&quot; by a rotation to the correct angle. For example, if the hole is 270°, the key is 180°, and if the hole is 240° (270° minus 30°), the key is 150° (180° with 30° notch) of the circle. In addition, there is a notch in the perimeter of each disc. A sidebar inside an opening in the lock cylinder around the discs and an edge in the casing obstruct the movement of the cylinder beyond the 90°.

When a correct key is inserted and turned, all the discs will rotate so that notches in the perimeters line up. This allows a sidebar to drop from the cylinder into the groove made by the lined-up notches in the discs, so that it does not obstruct the cylinder, allowing the cylinder to rotate and open the lock. If a key with one wrong notch is used, one disc will be rotated to an incorrect angle, thus its notch will not line up with the rest, and the lock cannot be unlocked.

The lock is locked again by rotating it into the other direction, sliding the sidebar back into the cylinder opening and allowing the straight edge of the key to return the discs to the scrambled &quot;zero&quot; position.

The mechanism makes it easy to construct locks that can be opened with multiple different keys: &quot;blank&quot; discs with a circular hole are used, and only notches shared by the keys are employed in the lock mechanism. This is commonly used for locks of common areas such as garages in apartment houses.

==Lock picking==
Disc tumblers tend to be more difficult to pick than competitively priced pin tumbler locks, and are often sold as &quot;high security&quot; locks for that reason. Picking the lock is not impossible but typically requires dedicated tools. They may also require more time to pick. They are similar in difficulty to pick as curtained 5-lever locks. The disc tumbler lock cannot be bumped. This level of difficulty tends to drive attention to alternative methods of gaining entry. More expensive locks have false gates which are similar to security pins on pin tumbler locks; catching the sidebar making one think they have picked a disc when in fact they have not.

The locking mechanism can be disabled destructively by drilling into the lock to destroy the sidebar. Anti-drilling plates can be installed to prevent this.

Alternatively, for cheaper locks, the discs can be bypassed by inserting a screwdriver or similar device to apply torque, causing the retaining clip to pop off and the core of the lock to spill out. The same effect can be created by turning a torque tool in the lock until the end cap pops off. After this, cheap plastic locks can be turned by hand, pulled out with pliers, or deformed by heating, causing the lock to open, or completely fall apart. More expensive disc tumbler locks use metal parts that can defeat this technique or make it more difficult.

<doc id="374985" wikidata="Q676148" url="?curid=374985" title="Battle of Mansfield">
<text>The Battle of Mansfield, also known as the Battle of Sabine Crossroads, on April 8, 1864, in Louisiana formed part of the Red River Campaign during the American Civil War, when Union forces were attempting to occupy the Louisiana state capital, Shreveport.

The Confederate commander, Major-General Dick Taylor, chose Mansfield as the place where he would make his stand against the advancing Union army under General Nathaniel Banks. Taylor concentrated his forces at Sabine Crossroads, knowing that reinforcements were nearby. Banks prepared for a fight, though his own army was not fully assembled either. Both sides were reinforced by stages throughout the day.

After a brief resistance, the Union army was routed by the Confederates, consisting mainly of units from Louisiana and Texas, reportedly strengthened by hundreds of men breaking parole. The Battle of Mansfield was followed immediately by the Battle of Pleasant Hill.

== Prelude ==
During the second half of March 1864, a combined force from the Union Army of the Gulf and navy led by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks, supported by Admiral David Porter&#x27;s fleet of gunboats, ascended the Red River with the goal of defeating the Confederate forces in Louisiana and capturing Shreveport. By April 1 Union forces had occupied Grand Ecore and Natchitoches. While the accompanying gunboat fleet with a portion of the infantry continued up the river, the main force followed the road inland toward Mansfield, where Banks knew his opponent was concentrating.

Major General Richard Taylor, in command of the Confederate forces in Louisiana, had retreated up the Red River in order to connect with reinforcements from Texas and Arkansas. Taylor selected a clearing a few miles south of Mansfield as the spot where he would take a stand against the Union forces. Sending his cavalry to harass the Union vanguard as it approached, Taylor called his infantry divisions forward.

The morning of April 8 found Banks&#x27;s army stretched out along a single road through the woods between Natchitoches and Mansfield. When the cavalry at the front of the column found the Confederates taking a strong position along the edge of a clearing, they stopped and called for infantry support. Riding to the front, Banks decided that he would fight Taylor at that spot, and he ordered all his infantry to hurry up the road. It became a race to see which side could bring its forces to the front first.

== Opposing forces ==

=== Confederate ===
At the start of the battle, Taylor had approximately 9,000 troops consisting of Brigadier General Alfred Mouton&#x27;s Louisiana/Texas infantry division, Major General John G. Walker&#x27;s Texas infantry division, Brigadier General Thomas Green&#x27;s Texas cavalry division, and Colonel William Vincent&#x27;s Louisiana cavalry brigade. He had also called on the 5,000 men in the divisions of Brigadier General Thomas J. Churchill and Brigadier General Mosby M. Parsons that had been encamped near Keachi, between Mansfield and Shreveport. These troops arrived late in the afternoon, after the battle had commenced.

Eyewitness accounts indicate that there were additional Louisiana men in the ranks. This included paroled soldiers from units that had surrendered at Vicksburg, including many members of company B of the 17th Louisiana Regiment, the Sabine Rebels. Historian Gary Joiner claimed that &quot;there may have been from several hundred to several thousand of them.&quot; The Confederate Governor of Louisiana, Henry Watkins Allen, had organized two battalions of the state guard and brought them to Taylor&#x27;s aid, yet the documentary record is unclear as to what role they played in the battle. Joseph Blessington, a soldier in Walker&#x27;s division, wrote that, &quot;The Louisiana militia, under command of Governor Allen, was held in reserve, in case of an emergency.&quot; In addition, Blessington wrote that, from the surrounding communities, &quot;old men shouldered their muskets and came to our assistance&quot;.

=== Union ===

At the start of the battle, the Union forces consisted of a cavalry division commanded by Brigadier General Albert L. Lee, consisting of approximately 3,500 men, and the 4th Division of the XIII Corps, commanded by Colonel William J. Landram, consisting of approximately 2,500 men. During the battle, the 3rd Division of the XIII Corps, commanded by General Robert A. Cameron, arrived with approximately 1,500 men. The battle ended when the pursuing Confederates met the 1st Division of the XIX Corps, commanded by Brigadier General William H. Emory, with approximately 5,000 men, including the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, the only regiment from the Keystone State to fight in the Union&#x27;s 1864 Red River Campaign. Thomas E. G. Ransom commanded the XIII Corps during the engagement, while the XIX Corps was commanded by William B. Franklin.

== Battle ==
During the morning, Taylor positioned Mouton&#x27;s division on the east side of the clearing. Walker&#x27;s division arrived in the afternoon and formed on Mouton&#x27;s right. As Green&#x27;s cavalry fell back from the advancing Union forces, two brigades moved to Mouton&#x27;s flank and the third to Walker&#x27;s flank. The Arkansas division arrived around 3:30 pm but was sent to watch a road to the east. The Missouri division did not arrive until around 6:00 pm, after the battle was fought.

At around noon, the Union cavalry division, supported by one infantry brigade of Landram&#x27;s division, was deployed across a small hill at the south end of the clearing. Shortly thereafter the other brigade of Landram&#x27;s division arrived. Cameron&#x27;s division was on its way, but would not get there until the battle had already begun.

For about two hours the two sides faced each other across the clearing as Banks waited for more of his troops to arrive and Taylor arranged his men. At that point, Taylor enjoyed a numerical advantage over Banks. At about 4:00 pm, the Confederates surged forward. On the east side of the road, Mouton was killed, while several of his regimental commanders were hit as well and the charge of his division was repulsed. However, west of the road, Walker&#x27;s Texas division wrapped around the Union position, folding it in on itself. Ransom was wounded trying to rally his men and was carried from the field; hundreds of Union troops were captured and the rest retreated in a panic. As the first Union line collapsed, Cameron&#x27;s division was arriving to form a second line but it too was pushed back by the charging Confederates, with Franklin wounded as well but remaining on the field in command. For several miles the Confederates pursued the retreating Union troops until they encountered a third line formed by Emory&#x27;s division. The Confederates launched several charges on the Union line but were repulsed, while nightfall ended the battle.

== Aftermath ==
The Union forces had suffered 113 killed, 581 wounded, and 1,541 captured as well as the loss of 20 cannons, 156 wagons, and a thousand horses and mules, killed or captured. More than half of the Union casualties were from four regiments – 77th Illinois, 130th Illinois, 19th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry and 48th Ohio. Most of the Union casualties occurred in the XIII Corps, while the XIX Corps lost few men.

Kirby Smith reported that Confederate loss was &quot;about 1,000 killed and wounded&quot; at Mansfield, but precise details of Confederate losses were not recorded. The local town of Keachi converted its women&#x27;s college into a hospital and morgue on its second floor. One hundred soldiers&#x27; remains are marked nearby in Keachi&#x27;s Confederate Cemetery, maintained by the local Sons of Confederate Veterans and Daughters of the Confederacy.

After the Union troops retreated, they fought Confederates again on April 9 at the Battle of Pleasant Hill.

== Battlefield preservation ==

On April 7, 2017, the American Battlefield Trust (then known as The Civil War Trust) announced that it had joined with Cleco, a regional energy company, to preserve of the Mansfield Battlefield. The property was a donation from Cleco and was the first parcel associated with the battle&#x27;s final phase that was preserved. Including the 14.5 acres, the Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield.

<doc id="374996" wikidata="Q7015284" url="?curid=374996" title="New Zealand Cross (1869)">
<text>The New Zealand Cross was introduced in 1869 during the New Zealand Wars in New Zealand. The wars were fought between natives of New Zealand, the Māori, and forces raised by European settlers known as Pākehā assisted by British troops.

Many acts of bravery, gallantry and devotion to duty were recorded among the local militia, armed constabulary and volunteers, but there was one militia Victoria Cross awarded to Charles Heaphy in 1867 for action in 1864.

On 10 March 1869, without checking the facts and under the mistaken impression colonial troops were not eligible for the Victoria Cross unless under command of British troops, the Governor of New Zealand, Sir George Bowen, instituted the New Zealand Cross as the highest New Zealand award.

He was widely criticised in England, and accused of usurping the prerogative of Queen Victoria, but she eventually ratified his action.

Only 23 New Zealand Crosses were awarded with first six published in the New Zealand Gazette in 1869. There was one award gazetted in 1870 and the remaining 16 awards gazetted between 1875 and 1910, from six to 44 years after the actions commended.

It has the form of a silver cross pattée. The obverse contains the words &#x27;NEW ZEALAND&#x27; in the centre, gilded in gold, which are encircled by a laurel wreath. Each limb of the cross has a six-point star, in gold. The cross is surmounted by a gold Imperial State Crown. The reverse of the medal has two concentric circles with the name of the recipient engraved between the circles, and the date of the action engraved within the inner circle. A crimson ribbon passes through a silver suspender clasp with small gold laurel leaves. For the first 20 medals cast in 1871, the reverse of the suspender clasp contains the cartouche of the goldsmith Messrs Phillips Brothers and Son of Cockspur Street, London; which was omitted from a further five medals cast in 1886.

==Recipients==

* Private Thomas Adamson, Corps of Guides, Ahikereru, 1869.

* Trooper Antonio Rodrigues de Sardinha, Taranaki Mounted Volunteers, Poutoko 1863 and Kaitake, 1864.
* Sergeant Richard Shepherd, Armed Constabulary, Otauto, 1869.
* Cornet Angus Smith, Bay of Plenty Cavalry Volunteers, Opepe, 1869.
* Major Ropata Wahawaha, Native Contingent, Ngatapa, 1869.
* Assistant-Surgeon Samuel Walker, Armed Constabulary, Otauto, 1869.
* Cornet Harry Charles William Wrigg, Bay of Plenty Cavalry Volunteers, Opotiki, 1867.

One member of the New Zealand colonial forces, Major Charles Heaphy was awarded the VC for his actions in 1864, when he was commanding British troops. See List of New Zealand Victoria Cross recipients and New Zealand Land Wars Victoria Cross recipients.

==1999 Medal==

In 1999, the New Zealand Cross was re-instituted. The Royal Warrant of 20 September 1999 created four awards for bravery and four for gallantry.

The new New Zealand Cross for Bravery is similar to the 1869 medal with some amendments. The Crown is now the current St Edward&#x27;s Crown instead of the Victorian Imperial State Crown, and New Zealand fern fronds replace laurel leaves. The ribbon is bright blue, a colour traditionally associated with bravery awards.

There is also a new Victoria Cross for New Zealand for Gallantry, which has the same crimson ribbon and is made to the same design and of the same gunmetal as the British VC.

<doc id="374998" wikidata="Q7258017" url="?curid=374998" title="Transport in Mumbai">
<text>Transport in Mumbai is achieved by both public and private transport. As of 2016, 52% of commuters use public transport. Mumbai has the largest organized bus transport network among major Indian cities.

Mumbai&#x27;s public transport consists primarily of rapid transit on exclusive suburban railway lines augmented by commuter rail on main lines serving outlying suburbs, the bus services of the three municipalities making up the metropolitan area, public taxis and auto rickshaws, as well as ferry services. A metro and a monorail system were inaugurated in 2014. A commercial seaplane service was also introduced in 2014.

==Road==
===Sea-links===
As of 2024, Mumbai currently has 3 major operational or under construction sea-links:

The Bandra–Worli Sea Link bridge is one of the longest bridges in the country, opened in 2009. It connects the suburbs of Bandra and Worli, and carries around 32,000 vehicles daily as of 2018.

The Trans Harbour Link is the longest bridge in India. It was opened on 12 January 2024, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the bridge. It connects Mumbai with Navi Mumbai and is 21.8 kilometers in length. The bridge runs between the localities of Sewri in South Mumbai to Ulwe of Navi Mumbai.

The Coastal Road (officially the Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj Coastal Motorway) is an under construction 8-lane, 29.2-km long expressway that will run along Mumbai&#x27;s western coastline. It will connect the locality of Marine Lines in the south to Mumbai and Kandivali in the North. It is projected to be used by 130,000 vehicles daily and to reduce travel time between South Mumbai and the Western Suburbs from 2 hours to 40 minutes. Its first phase was inaugurated on 11 March 2024.

===Buses===
*Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) has a fleet of single, double decker buses and air-conditioned Tata Marcopolo CNG mini buses. BEST runs their buses in Mumbai and its surrounding area.
*Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport (NMMT) operates air-conditioned Volvo buses from Navi Mumbai to Bandra, Dadar, Mantralaya &amp; Borivali and non A/C buses from Navi Mumbai to Mulund, Kurla, Dadar, Andheri, Dindoshi &amp; Mantralaya.
*Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) operates buses from Thane to Mulund, Borivali, Mira Road, BKC &amp; Andheri.
*Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Transport (MBMT) operates buses from Mira-Bhayandar to Andheri, Thane and Borivali.

===Taxis===

Taxis arrived in 1911 to complement horse cars. Black and yellow Fiat taxis are an integral part of the city&#x27;s heritage and have been depicted in numerous Bollywood movies. Metered taxis ply throughout Mumbai and have a monopoly from Bandra to Churchgate on the Western line and Sion to Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus on the Central line. Beyond Sion and Bandra auto rickshaws are not allowed and one has to hire a taxi. However, between Sion to Thane and Bandra to Bhayandar, both Taxis and autorickshaws are available to transport passengers.

* Silver-Green taxis run by Meru and Yellow-Red by Gold cabs and Black by Mega Cabs
* Blue and silver air-conditioned metered taxis known as &quot;Cool Cabs&quot;
* Some private taxi operators provide yellow number plate cars for transportation

Mumbai is served by two intra-city highways: Old Mumbai-Pune Highway and Mumbai-Ahmedabad Highway.

====Number of taxis====
There are around 58,000 taxis in Greater Mumbai and 98,566 in Mumbai MMR as of 2010.

Classic black and yellow taxi numbers on Greater Mumbai roads had fallen to 20,000 by 2010, as 35,000 new taxis such as Maruti Alto, Wagon R and Omni, Tata Indica and Hyundai Santro had entered service. Recently State Transport Authority of Maharashtra State has also introduced the on-call facility to book these taxis.

====Taxi Regulations====
Law requires the driver of an unengaged taxi to take a passenger wherever they want to go, regardless of distance or time, if the fare meter of the unengaged rickshaw/taxi is in a &#x27;For Hire&#x27; mode. The modes were denoted by older mechanical meters in this manner: a) upright – for hire b) half mast – not doing business c) facing down-currently hired.

Authorities encourage passengers to make complaints, for refusal to convey, excess fare, tampered meters, fake tariff cards, misconduct by drivers by direct email as well as by a website.

===Rickshaws===
Auto rickshaws play an important role in public transport in Mumbai. There are 246,458 black and yellow metered auto rickshaws, often simply called &quot;autos&quot;, in the Mumbai MMR as of 2008. Since 2002, all auto rickshaws have been required to use CNG as fuel. However, not all rickshaws comply. In some areas if a CNG filling facility is not available, the fuel is either petrol or LPG.

Auto rickshaws are not permitted to enter Old Bombay. The southernmost points accessible to them are Bandra Fire Station in Western Mumbai and Sion Bus Depot in Central Mumbai. Auto rickshaws registered in Mumbai are not allowed travel beyond the municipal limits. They have been allowed to travel between Sion to Mulund in the Central Suburbs and up to Mankhurd on the Harbour line. People who wish to travel beyond Mumbai to suburbs like Vashi, Airoli have to catch a suburban rickshaw. In the western suburbs, they are allowed to travel between Bandra and Bhayandar only.

A mechanical meter decides the fare which is proportional to distance traveled. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Transport Authority (MMRTA) updated the auto-rickshaw fares and declared a hike recently that is applied from 1 March 2021. The regulation for auto rickshaws is similar to taxis, and methods of complaining against the auto rickshaws and taxis are available on the Mumbai RTO website.

===Survey===

In 2021, UK-based car-sharing company Hiyacar has announced in a survey that Mumbai is the most stressful city in the world for driving. Public transportation options are one of the main factors which were observed for the survey.

==Rail==
===Mumbai Suburban Railway===

The Mumbai Suburban Railway is the oldest commuter rail in Asia, founded in 1853. It is owned by Indian Railways and operated by its Western Railways and Central Railways divisions. Most economical transport subsidized by the government of India via Railway ministry. With a length of 430 km, it has highest passenger density in the world, 7.5 million people daily, more than half of daily capacity of Indian Railways. It has four radial lines:

* Western between Churchgate and Dahanu Road
* Central between Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) and Kasara/Khopoli
* Harbour, running between CST and Panvel/Goregaon
* Trans-Harbour, running between Thane and Vashi/Panvel

Mumbai railways offer first class commuter transport. First class fares are approximately 10 times the second class fare and tend to be less crowded in the non-rush hour period. First class compartments also have slightly better seats than second class. While less crowded during non-peak hours, the first class compartments are rather more crowded during the peak hour time, as there is a large supply and demand gap. It is notoriously hard to get into the first class compartment as the coach is overcrowded with people hanging out of the doors.

Since 2017, Mumbai Suburban Rail became the first in India to operate Air-Conditioned rakes in its Western and Central line. These rakes are equipped with automatic doors and are vestibuled in a 12-coach configuration with coaches 1 to 6 vestibuled, motor connection between coaches 6 and 7 and coaches 7 to 12 again vestibuled.

There are also women-only cars (termed &#x27;ladies&#x27;), and since 1992, &#x27;Ladies Special&#x27; trains with all coaches reserved for women passengers.

===Metro===

In January 2004, a master transit plan was unveiled by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). The plan integrated a 146 kilometer-long metro system, of which 32 km would be underground.

In June 2004, government approval was given for a 12-station elevated line between Ghatkopar and Versova. In June 2006, the first phase of the Mumbai Metro project was inaugurated. Construction work began in February 2008. A successful trial run was conducted in May 2013, and the system&#x27;s first line entered operation in June 2014, although some aspects of the project were afflicted by delays and cost issues. The Mumbai Metro opened on 8 June 2014. On 2 April 2022, Metro line 2A and 7 were inaugurated, these two lines have a combined length of 19,25 km and will reduce the traffic congestion in North Mumbai.

Many more lines are under-construction or planned having a total length of 345 km (215 mi).

===Monorail===

The Mumbai Monorail is a monorail system for the city of Mumbai. Construction began in January 2009 and the first operational line was inaugurated on 1 February 2014. It is being contracted by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority and is the first monorail in India.

Four lines were proposed. The first two are long. Out of the two, Line 1 was opened to the public in 2014.
*Initial plans were to build a line running from Malabar Hill to the Bandra-Kurla complex via the Haji Ali Dargah, Jacob Circle, Wadala Road, Sion Hospital and Dharavi. This was planned to have been opened by 2011.
*A line from Thane to Bhiwandi via Kalyan. A consultant&#x27;s report to government has recommended that this corridor be served instead by a road-based system for the next 10–15 years using buses and bus rapid transit. 
Two lines long were to be constructed after the first two have opened.
*Chembur to Jacob Circle via Mahul. This route is planned to have been opened by December 2010. (May get extended to Vashi, Navi Mumbai.)
*Lokhandwala Complex to Kanjurmarg via Oshiwara.
Additionally, previously planned Mumbai Metro corridors are also being examined to be made as monorail corridors instead of the metro by MMRDA due to the dense and congested areas these corridors pass through. The corridors are:
*Hutatma Chowk – Ghatkopar – 21.8 km
*Ghatkopar – Mulund – 12.4 km

===Bullet Train===
The 650 km Mumbai-Ahemdabad Bullet train project is another major high-speed rail project that is supposed to run between Mumbai and Ahemdabad is poised to revolutionize travel time between these two major cities which usually would take about 7 to 8 hours to a meager 2hrs 57mins.This would create demand for real estate in key areas such as Thane, Dombivali and Kalyan.

===Trams===
Trams were an important form of transport until the mid-1960s. They were introduced in the late 19th century and in their heyday, covered many areas of the city. At their peak, route length grew to more than 47 kilometers. The system closed down in 1964.

==Ferry==
* from Vashi (in Navi Mumbai) to the Gateway of India
* to Elephanta Caves and to nearby places such as Alibaug, Rewas, and Mandwa
* in northern Mumbai across the Manori Creek. The barges operate at regular intervals across the shallow creek linking Manori to Malad
* from Versova to Madh Island

==Air==
The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (formerly Sahar International Airport) is the main aviation hub in the city and the second busiest airport in India in terms of passenger traffic. It handled 30.74 million passengers and 656,369 tonnes of cargo during FY 2011–12.

The new integrated terminal T2 was inaugurated on 10 January 2014 and opened for international operations on 12 February 2014, increasing the capacity of the airport to 40 million passengers annually. A dedicated six lane, elevated road connecting the new terminal with the main arterial Western Express Highway was also opened to the public the same day.

The proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport to be built in the Kopra-Panvel area has been sanctioned by the Indian Government and will help relieve the increasing traffic burden on the existing airport.

The Juhu Aerodrome was India&#x27;s first airport, and now hosts a flying club and a heliport.

<text>Ray Crist (March 8, 1900 – July 23, 2005) was an American chemist who participated in the Manhattan Project. When he retired from teaching at the age of 104 in 2004, Crist is widely believed to have been America&#x27;s oldest worker at the time.

==Biography==
Crist was a graduate of the former Messiah School (1916), now known as Messiah University, Dickinson College (B.A., 1920) and Columbia University (Ph.D., 1925). Crist joined the faculty at Columbia University where he was a teacher and researcher from 1925 to 1941. He joined the Manhattan Project in 1941 and was among the leading scientists who developed the critical initial step of the separation of uranium isotopes. He was director of the Manhattan Project, Columbia University Group, 1945-6, after which he joined the Union Carbide Corporation in Charleston, West Virginia, first as Manager of the Coal Hydrogenation Plant, and then as Director of Research of the Olefins Division.

Between 1959 and 1963, he was Director of the Union Carbide Research Institute at Tarrytown, New York. Crist turned to volunteer teaching in 1963, following the death of his beloved wife, Dorothy Lenhart Crist, formerly of New Cumberland. As a voluntary educator, Crist pursued his mission of introducing today&#x27;s students, especially non-science majors, to the impact of science and technology on culture and the environment.

From 1963-1970, he taught at Dickinson College. There, he taught mostly upper-level chemistry courses. However, his favorite course was on the history of science; it was a course for non-majors where he &quot;helped students to understand some of the basic laws of the natural world around them.&quot; In 1970, Crist was forced to resign due to the since repealed mandatory retirement age of 70.

From 1971 until his retirement in 2004, he continued his academic career at Messiah University. He taught mostly environmental chemistry and was a major force behind the development of the Environmental Sciences program. During the final two decades of his work at Messiah, up to the age of 104, he worked on experiments involving adsorption of toxic metals by plant material and the use of living plants for purifying the environment (phytoremediation). The results of these experiments appeared in twenty-seven journal articles and were reported at ten international conferences. Messiah professor of the history of science Edward B. Davis believes that he may have been the oldest publishing research scientist in history.

His academic achievements and his overcoming the challenges of aging were recognized by numerous events and awards such as America&#x27;s Outstanding Older Worker (2002), the PBS series &quot;The Living Century&quot; in the episode &quot;A Teacher and Student for Life&quot;, and the editorial &quot;Phytoremediation&#x27;s Centenarian&quot; (International Journal of Phytoremediation, 2002), as well as extensive additional press and television coverage both in the United States and abroad. His memoir - Listening to Nature: My Century in Science (Seaburn Publications) - appeared in 2005. Crist died in Carlisle, Pennsylvania on July 23, 2005, at the age of 105.

<text>Wellington County is a county and census division located in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, and is part of the Greater Golden Horseshoe. The county consists of two towns and five townships, with its seat in the City of Guelph, which is geographically within the county but administered independently. According to the 2021 census, the population of the census division was 241,026.

Many of the residents in the southern part of the county commute to urban areas such as Guelph, Kitchener, Waterloo, Brampton, Mississauga, Toronto and Hamilton for employment. The northern part of the county (comprising Minto, Mapleton, and Wellington North townships) is made up of mainly rural farming communities, except for a few larger towns such as Mount Forest and Arthur.

In 2018, the Warden of the county was Kelly Linton (mayor of Centre Wellington) and there were 14 Councillors. Police services are provided by the Ontario Provincial Police. Schools are operated by the Upper Grand District School Board and by the Wellington Catholic District School Board.

==Subdivisions==
The county is made up of seven lower-tier municipalities (in order of population):

* Centre Wellington, Township of (population centres: Fergus, Elora)
* Guelph/Eramosa, Township of (population centre: Rockwood)
* Wellington North, Township of (population centres: Mount Forest, Arthur)
* Erin, Town of (population centre: Erin)
* Mapleton, Township of (population centre: Drayton)
* Minto, Town of (population centres: Palmerston, Harriston)
* Puslinch, Township of

The City of Guelph, although part of the Wellington census division, is a single-tier city, municipally independent of the county. The primary economy outside of the city consists of agriculture and aggregate mining. The county is a major supplier of sand and gravel for the western part of the Greater Toronto Area.

==History==
===Evolution===
In 1837, by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, the District of Wellington was formed and a court house and jail in the town of Guelph were authorized. The District was named after England&#x27;s Duke of Wellington and its territory formed the County of Waterloo for electoral purposes. The limestone county courthouse and jail in the castellated style was built in 1842-44 and was subsequently expanded.

In 1849, Wellington District was abolished, and Waterloo County remained for municipal and judicial purposes. The territory of the Bruce Peninsula became part of Waterloo in 1849, but was later withdrawn and transferred to Bruce County in 1851.
In January 1852, Waterloo County became the United Counties of Wellington, Waterloo and Grey. The new county of Waterloo was withdrawn in January 1853, and the remainder was renamed the United Counties of Wellington and Grey.

In January 1854, the United Counties was dissolved, and Wellington and Grey were separate counties for all purposes.

Guelph was incorporated as a City in 1879 and withdrawn from the county. Amaranth, East Garafraxa, East Luther and Orangeville were transferred to Dufferin County during the period 1874–1882.

The Wellington County Jail (in Late Gothic Revival Style) and the Governor&#x27;s Residence (in Georgian style) at 74 Woolwich Street were built in 1911; they were designated by the city for &quot;historic and architectural value&quot; and as a National Historic Site in 1983. The property is now an Ontario Court of Justice.

===Historic townships===
By 1881, the county had settled into its present form, with the following townships and related towns and villages:

In 1999, seven new municipalities (Townships) were created within Wellington County through amalgamation.

=== From &quot;poorhouse&quot; to museum ===
In 1877, the county opened the Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge, or Poorhouse as it was called, on Wellington Road 18 between Fergus and Elora. Over the years, approximately 1500 deserving poor, including those who were destitute, old and infirm or suffering from disabilities were housed here. The sixty bed house for inmates was surrounded by a 30-acre &quot;industrial&quot; farm with a barn for livestock that produced some of the food for the 70 residents and the staff and also provided work for them. Others worked in the House itself. According to a 2009 report by the Toronto Star, &quot;pauperism was considered a moral failing that could be erased through order and hard work&quot;. A hospital was added in 1892. A nearby cemetery has 271 plots for those who died. In 1947 the House was converted into the Wellington County Home for the Aged and in 1975 the building reopened as the Wellington County Museum and Archives.

A historic plaque was erected at the museum, indicating that the &quot;government-supported poorhouse&quot; was &quot;the shelter of last resort for the homeless and destitute, who traded spartan accommodations for domestic or agricultural labour&quot;.

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Wellington County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Community involvement and awards==

Canada&#x27;s Safest Employers Awards recognize organizations from all across Canada with outstanding accomplishments in promoting the health and safety of their workers.

In 2014 (Gold), and again in 2016 (Silver), the County of Wellington received Canada&#x27;s Psychological Safety Award. Canada&#x27;s Safest Employer Awards introduced a new Psychological Safety Award in 2014 to recognize organizations that are committed to employee mental health and are working towards implementing the National Standard for Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace.

The County of Wellington in Ontario, Canada, embarked on the BR+E journey beginning in 2013. Two years later, the county has reaped significant rewards with the candle on the cake represented by two BREI awards at the BREI Annual Conference in 2014.

The County of Wellington proudly received the 2015 Employer of Distinction Award at an Award Ceremony presented by the Guelph and District Human Resources Professionals Association in Guelph.

In early 2018, Alma resident Jim deBock received the Ontario Medal for Good Citizenship for his extensive volunteer work.

==Travel Region==

<doc id="375010" wikidata="Q1156874" url="?curid=375010" title="Pacific Airlines">
<text>Pacific Airlines Joint Stock Aviation Company (, operating as Pacific Airlines) is a low-cost airline and ground services provider headquartered in Tan Binh District, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, with its primary operating base at Tan Son Nhat International Airport. From 2008 to 2020, it was known as Jetstar Pacific Airlines (as a subsidiary of Jetstar).

The airline began operations in 1991, flying chartered cargo services. From 1996 to 2005, the airline, along with other local companies, operated under the government-owned Vietnam Airlines Corporation. Having by now operated passenger services, Pacific Airlines then came under the control of the government itself. In 2007, the Vietnamese government sold a 30% shareholding to Qantas, and as such the airline adopted a low-cost operations model and adopted its name (Jetstar Pacific) on 23 May 2008, becoming part of the Jetstar network.

In February 2012, Vietnam Airlines bought a 70% stake in the company. As part of its expansion plan, it was intended that Jetstar Pacific will have up to 15 Airbus A320 aircraft by the end of 2015 and up to 30 aircraft by 2020. In late 2020, Qantas sold its stakes in Jetstar Pacific to Vietnam Airlines and the carrier returned to its old brand name Pacific Airlines.

On 8 March 2024, Pacific Airlines temporarily suspended all of its services and flights and decommissioned its whole fleet, citing financial difficulties and pressure from lessors. The airline resumed its nominal operations on 26 June 2024 after a period of restructuring, using a single Vietnam Airlines airplane.

== History ==
=== Early operations ===

Pacific Airlines was established in December 1990 and began operations in April 1991 with a start-up capital of US$2.47 million. It was the first carrier to be established in Vietnam following reforms that permitted foreign investment in the country&#x27;s airlines. Pacific Airlines operated chartered cargo flights to Thailand, Pakistan and France in cooperation with AOM French Airlines. In 1993, prior to the lifting of the US embargo against Vietnam, the airline signed a deal with United Airlines that would have involved the training of Pacific Airlines&#x27; personnel and that had provisions for cooperation on US–Vietnam services.

In 1994, the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) proposed plans to the government about the possible trading of minority stakes of Vietnam Airlines, VASCO and Pacific Airlines to investors. With the lifting of the US embargo, the country was looking for funds for aircraft procurements. Such plans did not materialise. However, in 1996, Pacific Airlines was consolidated with several air-service companies, including Vietnam Airlines, to establish Vietnam Airlines Corporation. During the same year, Pacific Airlines wet-leased a Boeing 737-300 from Swiss charter carrier TEA Basel. In addition to its jointly serviced cargo destinations, Pacific had by now opened services to Hanoi, Hong Kong and Taipei.

In 2000, Pacific entered into an agreement with Greek charter airline Galaxy Airways whereby the Vietnamese carrier would operate flights to Taipei on its behalf. In 2001, the airline&#x27;s revenues totalled US$48 million, having made 3,600 flights using an Airbus A310 and two A321s. From 2001 to 2004, a succession of regional and global events, namely the September 11 attacks, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the SARS outbreak and a rise in oil prices, as well as misguided management decisions, contributed to a cumulative loss of more than  million at the airline. Consequently, Vietnam Airlines Corporation in late 2004 submitted a report about Pacific Airlines to the government, who decreed that all of the carrier&#x27;s shares belonging to the corporation must be transferred to the Ministry of Finance (MoF). As a result, the MoF assumed control of 86.49% of shares, with Saigon Tourist (13.06%) and Tradevico (0.45%) making up the rest.

The Ministry in January 2005 announced plans to sell all of its shares to increase the available capital by 20 times One prospective investor was Temasek Holdings, who was looking to inject US$50 million to revive the business, which might have entailed launching passenger flights to Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Talks with various parties fell through. It was not until January 2007 when rumours circulated about another prospective investor.

=== Jetstar Pacific ===
Australian airline Qantas was in talks with the State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC), who was then managing the government&#x27;s stake in Pacific Airlines, about a possible investment in the carrier. Three months later, Qantas agreed to a minority stake in Pacific as part of its plan to expand its low-cost operations through Jetstar in Southeast Asia. The deal was finalised in July when Qantas acquired an 18% stake for US$30 million, with provisions to eventually increase the stake to 30%; SCIC held the majority of the remaining shares. The deal would see the carrier, restructure as a low-cost airline and launch flights to the surrounding countries with a fleet of 30 Airbus A320s by 2014. It was renamed Jetstar Pacific Airlines (JPA, alternatively known as Jetstar Pacific) in May 2008.

JPA began its low-cost flights with service to Nha Trang and Da Nang. Due to high fuel costs, Nha Trang service was suspended, and the airline lost $22 million in 2008. Passenger service launches to Bangkok and Siem Reap were deferred, and SCIC stated the airline would need US$35 million to operate in 2009.

Jetstar Pacific embarked on its fleet modernisation plan in 2009, as it replaced several Boeing 737-400s with leased A320s. It made its first profit (US$1.1 million) in July that year after long periods of losses. The airline expanded its domestic market share as it transported more than 1.5 million passengers in the first half of 2009. Despite these developments, the airline encountered branding issues when the CAAV in October decreed that it must replace its Jetstar brand and logo with a new identity; the CAAV cited possible consumer confusion with Jetstar Airways and that a foreign airline could potentially exploit the Jetstar Pacific&#x27;s branding to advertise it products. Later that year, CEO Luong Hoai Nam suddenly quit the airline having served since 2004.

In January 2010, clarifications about Nam surfaced when Vietnamese authorities reportedly detained the former CEO and prevented COO Daniela Masilli and CFO Tristan Freeman from leaving the country. This was part of an investigation into fuel hedging losses, which reportedly had cost the airline US$31 million. Qantas responded to the complication by replacing the two administrators. Due to the investigation into fuel-hedging allegations, growth plans at the airline were stalled.

Funding issues persisted through 2011. In addition to the fuel price fluctuations, compounded by the government-sanctioned fare cap, JPA had to address lease and maintenance fees for its aircraft. During the year, reports indicated that VAC would re-assume control of the carrier; according to &quot;Saigon Tiep Thi&quot;, the SCIC would transfer 70% of its shares to Vietnam Airlines. However, Jetstar denied such speculation. On 16 January 2012, the Vietnamese government confirmed the allegations by &quot;Saigon Tiep Thi&quot; by decreeing a transfer of SCIC shares to Vietnam Airlines, which took place in February. The transfer brought forward plans by Vietnam Airlines to have its own LCC by 2014. As part of its current expansion plan, it is intended that Jetstar Pacific will have up to 15 Airbus A320s by the end of 2015. The remaining 30% of Jetstar Pacific was held by Qantas (most likely for naming rights).

=== Return as Pacific Airlines ===
In June 2020, Vietnam Airlines announced that it would take over all Qantas&#x27;s shares and increase its ownership of Jetstar Pacific to 98%. The airline will no longer be operating under the Jetstar brand, but will revert to its original name Pacific Airlines. The ticketing system will also be migrated from the Qantas-based system used by Jetstar to the Sabre system used by Vietnam Airlines.

==== Financial issues and restructuring proposal ====
Approximately one year after the Qantas withdrawal, in June 2021, Vietnam Airlines declared that the impact of COVID-19 had resulted in the financial situation of Pacific Airlines being &quot;extremely serious&quot;, posing the possibilities of insolvency and termination of operations. The Vietnamese state-owned flag carrier is looking for investors in order to restructure Pacific Airlines, however, it was revealed that the investor selection process faced many legal and other obstacles due to the fact that it (both Vietnam Airlines and Pacific Airlines) is a state-owned enterprise, admitting that the situation of Pacific Airlines &quot;would be at risk&quot; if no agreement is reached.

In March 2024, due to serious difficulties, Pacific Airlines declared pausing its operations, with its parent Vietnam Airlines handling all the affected customers.

The carrier restarted operations by June 2024 with three Airbus A321s from Vietnam Airlines.

== Destinations ==
As of 2020, Pacific Airlines operates more than 40 daily flights to domestic destinations from its main operating base at Tan Son Nhat International Airport.

<text>Cool TV is a Hungarian television channel owned by RTL Group. It was launched as m+ on 15 September 2003, but a year later, it was relaunched as Cool TV on 4 September 2004.

==History==

===2003–2010===
Originally Cool TV had the target audience of urban 15–29-year-olds who love music, externals, clothes, trendy lifestyle and extravagance. The channel was first launched as m+ on 15 September 2003, but a year later, it was relaunched as Cool TV on 4 September 2004, so the channel could be available in 2.5 million households.

The channel broadcast 24 hours a day and aired reruns of series that RTL Klub originally purchased or produced as well as series targeting today&#x27;s youth. In 2005, the channel has relocated on paper to Romania.

In 2007, Cool TV launched a series of topical shows produced by the channel, such as &quot;Cool Live&quot; and &quot;Cool Night&quot;, featuring younger hosts lent to Cool by RTL Klub; the former being a youth lifestyle show, and the latter being an adult show including interviews with Hungarian porn stars and producers, as well as occasionally showing soft-core porn video clips. These talkshows have now been cancelled.

In 2009, Cool TV purchased the airing rights of the successful Hungarian version of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, Beugró.

The channel broadcast 24 hours a day and aired reruns of series that RTL Klub originally purchased or produced, as well as series targeting today&#x27;s youth. These included: &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot; (&quot;Egy rém rendes család&quot;), &quot;24&quot;, &quot;Footballer&#x27;s Wives&quot; (&quot;Futbalista feleségek&quot;), &quot;The L Word&quot; (&quot;L&quot;), &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; (&quot;A fiúk a klubból&quot;), &quot;The Unit&quot; (&quot;Az egység&quot;), &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; (&quot;Haláli hullák&quot;), &quot;Weeds&quot; (&quot;Spangli&quot;), &quot;Skins&quot; (&quot;Skins&quot;), &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (&quot;Született feleségek&quot;)

===2010–present===
From 30 August 2010, Cool TV changed image and was rebranded, aiming for a wider audience. Since then, the channel airs mostly crime procedurals. The move was successful because as of July 2012 Cool TV is the third most watched commercial TV channel, and most watched cable channel in Hungary (target audience 18–49, prime time 19.00-23.00) beating main competitor Viasat 3. 

On 1 December 2014 at 09:00, Cool TV got its current image and it was rebranded again. The new logo is similar to the one introduced in 2010, however, the two red dots remained the same, but the previously gray circles turned white and 3D.

<text>The Mumbai Suburban Railway (colloquially called local trains or simply locals) consists of exclusive inner suburban railway lines augmented by commuter rail on main lines serving outlying suburbs to serve the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Spread over , the suburban railway operates 2,342 train services and carries more than 7.5 million commuters daily.

The daily commuters constitute around 40% of the daily commuters of Indian Railways. By annual ridership (2.64 billion), the Mumbai Suburban Railway is one of the busiest commuter rail systems in the world. Trains run from 04:00 until 01:00, and some trains also run up to 02:30 or 03:00. It is the first suburban rail network in India.

==History==

The Mumbai Suburban Railway is an offshoot of the first passenger railway to be built by the British East India Company, and is also the oldest railway system in Asia. The first train was run by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (now Central Railway) between Bori Bunder (now Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus) and Thane, a distance of , on 16 April 1853 at 15:35. The 14-coach train took 57 minutes to complete the 32 km journey, with a halt at Sion to refill the train&#x27;s water tanks.

The next major train was run between Virar and Churchgate by the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway (now Western Railway), in April 1867. was also added as a station on this route, but later shut down.
On 3 February 1925, the first EMU Service was started from Victoria Terminus (now Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus) to Coorla Harbour (now Kurla) on the Central line which was run on 1.5 kV DC traction and also started on the Western line from Churchgate to Borivali on 5 January 1928. By 2016, the entire network had been converted to 25 kV 50 Hz AC traction.

==Rolling stock==
The suburban services are run by electric multiple units (EMUs) in 191 rakes (train sets) of 12-car and 15-car composition. To alleviate the problems of overcrowding, the nine-car trains have been phased out and replaced with 12-car ones. 15-coach trains were introduced on 21 November 2009. However, these are few in number. Equipment makers include Jessop, Siemens, Bombardier, and Medha. The trains are manufactured at the Integral Coach Factory in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. All routes are electrified at power supply from overhead lines. The Indian Railways plans to build a 700 MW gas-based plant in Thakurli to generate electricity to run the Mumbai trains.

===Manufacturing===

The current fleet of both the Western and Central railways features a very few old rakes built by BHEL and ICF (Perambur, Chennai) which are capable of a maximum speed of , MRVC Siemens Rakes which are capable of and , ICF built Bombardier and Medha rakes capable of running at speeds of under light traffic conditions. The actual average speed of the rakes on the slow lines is about , while rakes on fast lines average about on a typical run. The old BHEL non-AC rakes are on the verge of being scrapped.

On 12 November 2007, the first of 129 new 12-coach rakes with upgraded facilities was inducted into the fleet of the Western Railways under the MUTP project. These rakes are popularly called Siemens rakes and have 1xxx and 2xxx numbering system. The coaches are built of stainless steel, and have non-cushioned seats, emergency fluorescent lights, bigger windows with polycarbonate panes, better suspension systems, roof-mounted forced ventilation to reduce carbon dioxide levels in packed trains, and GPS based passenger information systems in all coaches. The new rakes are much cooler and airy than the old EMUs. The motors of the new rakes also make less noise than the older ones. Since 2010, the front of the EMUs is painted yellow so that the maintenance workers on the tracks can see the train easily. These rakes have been procured under the project at a total cost of 19 billion (US$431.0 million). Siemens 5 rakes that had to be delivered as part of the first phase were sent to the city in early January 2014.

New EMUs with Bombardier Electrical procured under the World Bank-funded Mumbai Urban Transport Project-2 built at the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai started arriving into Mumbai by April 2014. They have 5xxx numbering system. The first of these trains, to be run on Western Railway, was flagged off by Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Kurla on Central Railway on Sunday, 27 October 2013. However, a delay of two years was anticipated due to the demands of automatic sliding doors on the trains. Under the Make in India initiative, the first Indian made rake was made by Medha. They have 6xxx series numbering. 9 car trains have a capacity of 2,628 (876 seated and 1,752 standing). 12 car trains have a capacity of 3,504 (1,168 seated and 2,336 standing). In fall 2013, brand new 12 car rakes were introduced on the railway. On 6 November 2019, the 5533-5536 rake of Mumbai Suburban Railway, called Uttam rake which also manufactured by the ICF was introduced and ran on Western Line.

===Air-conditioned rakes===

Discussion on AC coaches first began in 2002 and was planned to be introduced in 2013. However, major delays in finalizing the rakes&#x27; design and procurement of material deferred the project.

The first air-conditioned rake for use on the suburban system was built by the Integral Coach Factory in Chennai–BHEL EMU at a cost of over , and arrived in Mumbai on 5 April 2016. The rake has a seating capacity of 1,028 passengers, and standing room for up to 6,000 passengers. The 12 coach rake is configured as two sets of 6 interconnected bogies, meaning passengers can walk between coaches but only up to a maximum of 6 coaches. The train is also equipped with a new electrical system and software, automatic doors with emergency opening features, and GPS-based destination display on LED indicators. The old system of pulling a chain to halt the train was replaced by four intercoms per coach that enable commuters to communicate with the driver.

Both CR and WR competed to acquire the rake, with WR even announcing a time table for operating the air-conditioned rake. Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu announced that the rake would be transferred to CR on 16 March 2016. However, at a height of 4.335 meters the rake exceeds the maximum clearance height of 4.270 meters for EMU coaches on the Central Line. In particular, the rake cannot clear some of the low-height British-era bridges between CSMT and Kurla. Then Central Railway general manager Sunil Kumar Sood insisted that CR was conduct trials and operate the rake on the Harbour Line. After acquiring the rake, CR conducted tests, safety, and mobility checks, and trial runs under the supervision of the RDSO. However, following Sood&#x27;s retirement, CR abandoned plans to operate the rake in December 2016. CR informed the Railway Board that it could not operate the rake due to the clearance issue, and the Railway Board directed them to transfer the rake to WR. The rake was transferred to WR on 12 May 2017. WR General Manager Anil Kumar Gupta stated that rake would begin commercial operations on the Western Line after WR conducted its own tests and trial runs and receiving regulatory approvals. Although there are some clearance issues on the Western Line as well, Gupta stated that these could be rectified.

The First AC EMU was Flagged off on 25 December 2017 in WR. The first AC local train in Mumbai began operation in December 2017 and crossed the 10 lakh passenger mark within the first five months. The summer months of March and April saw over 3 lakh passengers take the AC local each month. The train, operated by Western Railway (WR), currently plies between Churchgate and Virar. It has a seating capacity of 1,028 seats and can carry 5,964 passengers. The monthly pass on the AC local train will cost (from Churchgate) between (till Mumbai Central) to (till Bandra) to (till Andheri) to (till Borivali) to (till Bhayander) to (till Vasai Road) to (till Virar). New halts were introduced after commuters demand at Marine Lines, Charni Road, Grant Road, Dahisar, Mira Road, Naigaon, Nallasopara. Data shows that among all stations between Churchgate and Virar. Borivali was the highest earner for the AC train. The monthly earning of AC train is approximately per month after adding seven new halts. Two more AC local rakes were introduced and now, the services run all days of the week.

The fourth air-conditioned rake on Mumbai Suburban Rail Network &amp; first for Central Railway has been commissioned on Trans-harbour line from Thane to Panvel / Vashi from 30 January 2020. The fifth air-conditioned rake on Mumbai Suburban Rail Network &amp; first for Central Railway Main Line was commissioned between Mumbai Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and Kalyan on 17 December 2020. After a gap of 3 years, the first 12-coach fully-vestibuled AC Local Train made by Medha was commissioned on Western Railway on 19 December 2022. This has 8xxx series numbering. Under the MUTP-III and MUTP-IIIA project, Western Railway has decided to procure more AC local trains and convert the entire fleet into AC akin to Kolkata Metro. In 2023, a new Medha rake with 71xx series numbering was introduced in Western Railway. All BHEL Made AC Local Trains in both the networks have 70xx series numbering.

==Network==

The Mumbai Suburban Railway system is operated by Indian Railways two zonal divisions Western Railways (WR) and Central Railways (CR). The fast commuter rail corridors on Central Railway as well as Western Railway are shared with long-distance and freight trains, while inner suburban services operate on exclusive parallel tracks. WR operates the Western Line and CR operates the Central Line, Harbour Line, Trans-Harbour Line, Vasai–Roha Line and Neral–Matheran &amp; Panvel–Karjat line.

===Central Line===
The Central Line in Mumbai consists of three major corridors, which bifurcate as they run into suburban satellite towns.
Two corridors (one local and the other through) of the Central Railway run from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) to (), where it bifurcates into two lines – one to () in the north-east and the other to () in the south-east. These two corridors constitute the &#x27;Main&#x27; Central Line. There is also a corridor between and stations for exclusive use by outstation and cargo trains.

The Central Line has two interchange stations with the Western Line, at and and the Harbour line at and . Rolling stock consists of a fleet of AC and alternating current new Bombardier and Siemens EMUs. The major car sheds on this line are at and . There are both fast and slow locals. Slow locals halt at every station, while fast locals&#x27; halts vary between , , , , , , , , , and . All trains traveling beyond Kalyan run as slow trains and stop at every station.

===Western Line===
The Western Line follows the Western Railway northwards from parallel to the west coast. Local services by electric multiple units (EMUs) ply between and () on exclusive parallel tracks up to () while MEMUs service the section beyond Virar to Dahanu Road (). On 16 April 2013 EMU has extended up to . MEMUs also operate between Dahanu Road and via a branch line from –. There are EMU carsheds at , and . The largest EMU car shed in Asia is located at Virar. A repair shop for EMUs is situated at .

Western Railway&#x27;s EMU fleet consists of EMUs completely powered by alternating current (25 kV) power. Rolling stock consists of a fleet of AC and alternating current new Bombardier EMUs. EMUs are 12 car or 15 car formations and are differentiated as slow and fast locals. Slow trains halt at all stations, while fast ones halt at , , , , , , and stations which are preferable over longer distances.

===Harbour Line===
The Harbour Line is part of the Central Railway, and runs from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) to and . All Harbour Line services operate as slow services. The line operates from two separate platforms at CSMT and the tracks cross over the mainline at to head towards stations along Mumbai&#x27;s Eastern dock area. A branch line from joins the Western Line at and continues towards . Further construction is ongoing to extend the Western Line branch to .

The Harbour Line has an interchange station with the mainline at , where it turns east towards Navi Mumbai. The Harbour Line further bifurcates at into two lines – one rejoins the main lines at , while the other continues to . The shed for these trains is in . A partial section of the Harbour Line is elevated from to .

===Trans-Harbour Line===

The Trans-Harbour Line which is another part of Central Railway connects Navi Mumbai and Thane. It operates from two separate platforms at to , where it joins the Harbour line till and a small branch line from goes to as it runs parallel with the Harbour line. All services on the trans-harbour line are all-stop services. Freight trains share the tracks through a bypass from to , after which it goes to a siding in Turbhe for the APMC market godowns.

===Vasai Road–Roha Line===

The Vasai Road–Roha line is an Intersection chord rail bypass line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway which connects the Western line, Central line and Harbor line of the Western Railway zone and Central Railway zone. It runs from to which also connects and the Konkan Railway. Currently this line is used for bypassing freight trains, Express and MEMU Passenger trains. And also construction of a separate Suburban Corridor on this route for more connectivity by the MRVC is going.

=== Port (Nerul–Uran) line===

The Nerul–Uran line, also known as the Port line, is another part of the Central Railway connects Navi Mumbai to Uran, which is also in Navi Mumbai, but at its southwestern part. It also operates from the two separate platforms of and one separate platform of to Uran, also making connectivity to JNPT in Navi Mumbai directly.

==Services==

Mumbai Suburban Railway services have trains with four main designations:
* Slow trains: (denoted by an S) stop at every station. These are intended for daily commuters.
* Fast trains: (denoted by an F) run express (skipping stops and going mainly to railway junctions) until a certain station, and from that station onward run like a slow train. These are intended for daily commuters as well as express connectivity to the rest of Indian Railways outbound trains.
*Air Conditioned trains: (denoted by an AC) which are air-conditioned and can be either fast or slow.

===Travel classes===

The suburban fleet consists of 12 and 15-coach rakes.
There are two main classes of travel; the First and Second classes. The first class fare is approximately 8 times more expensive than second class and therefore tends to be less crowded during the non rush hours, though at times it is equally or more crowded than the general compartments during rush hour, due to most office employees having a first class transport pass provided by their employer. First class and Senior Citizen compartments also have cushioned seating, while the rest are typically plastic. There are following classes of travel:

* Class I (&quot;first class compartment&quot;): Commonly known as &quot;first class&quot;. The coach is designated by red and yellow slant stripes. The location of the same is designated by colouring the platform walls with similar stripes. The price is generally hiked up by eight times to prevent the compartment overcrowding. The seats in this class are leather made.
* Class II (&quot;general compartment&quot;): Also called &quot;second class&quot;. The seats in this class are plastic-made.
*Class I-L (&quot;Ladies first class&quot;): similar to normal First Class, reserved solely for females. Men are not allowed to travel, and may face a penalty. Some of the coaches of ladies compartments are open to general public between 23:15 and 06:30. These are indicated by a note near the doors of the compartments. The coach is designated by red and yellow slant stripes. The location of the same is designated by colouring the platform walls with similar stripes. This compartment is often adjacent to the ladies general compartment.
*Class II-L (&quot;Ladies second class&quot;): This compartment is reserved solely for females. Men are not allowed to travel and can face a penalty. Male children are tolerated though still not legal. Some of the coaches of ladies compartments are open to the general public between 23:15 and 06:30. These are indicated by a note near the doors of the compartments. The coach is designated by green and yellow slant stripes. The location of the same is designated by colouring the platform walls with similar stripes.
*Divyangjan (&quot;Handicapped, Pregnant Ladies and Cancer patients&quot; compartment): for people with disabilities or cancer. On a platform, one can locate these by signs or by following a beeping sound indicator for the visually impaired, or also by following a yellow tactile path with a walking stick. These coaches are open to all the genders. One needs a valid certificate of disability to board the compartment. Failure to do so may result in a penalty.
*Senior citizens: is reserved for passengers above the age of 60. These coaches are open to all the genders. One needs a valid age proof to board the compartment. Failure to do so may result in a penalty.
*Luggage: heavy goods and luggage can be transported using this compartment. These compartments are spacious and only have seats along the walls and are made to haul goods.

There are also women-only cars (termed &quot;ladies special&quot;), and since 1992, &quot;Ladies Special&quot; trains with the entire train seats reserved for women passengers. A semi ladies special is a train with a few (e.g., three) coaches reserved for women. These designations can be combined with &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;slow&quot;, etc. with terms such as &quot;Slow Ladies Special&quot;.

===Air-conditioned===
The Mumbai Suburban Railways are known for their open doors and windows. This is because there is no ventilation system on the trains, and the train relies on natural air ventilation. This was introduced as a cost-saving measure, as an air-conditioning system would be rendered useless during rush hour. Leaving the doors open also allows for a fast boarding process, as the trains stop for only 10 seconds, to combat overcrowding. In 2016, the Indian Railways manufactured its first AC local train for providing better journeys in the hot and humid summer season. This rake is manufactured at the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai. It has several new facilities, such as connected vestibules and automatic doors. It runs from to on Western line and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus to and on Central line. AC trains include fast and slow locals and started their run from 25 December 2016 on WR and 30 January 2020 on CR.

===Ticketing===
The Mumbai Suburban Railway uses a proof-of-payment fare collection system. Tickets can be purchased at every train station. Travelling without a valid ticket is an offence and if caught can result in a penalty. The penalty is steeper for passengers travelling in first class without a valid ticket.

Tickets can be bought for a single journey (one way) or a return journey. A return ticket is valid till the next day on weekdays and till Monday if purchased on a Friday. The ticket counters usually have long queues.

Tourist tickets are valid for one, three, or five days that can be purchased up to three days in advance.

Platform tickets are required to be purchased by those members of the public not boarding trains, but who wish to access the platforms at all stations, perhaps for the purpose of receiving or seeing off a passenger and also to use footbridges. These cost . A person can be penalised for non-possession of this ticket.


;CVMs and ATVMs
To save time, a Coupon Booklet can be purchased and the coupons can be punched for the designated fare at Coupon Validating Machines (CVMs) at every station. The ticket fares matrix is pasted above the CVM. As of October 2012, there are approximately 575 CVMs on Mumbai Suburban Railway stations. The Central Railway network has 350 and the Western Line has 225.

In early 2015, the authorities decided to discontinue CVMs w.e.f 1 April 2015. This decision was taken due to extensive duplication of the coupons, and the lack of transparency. The coupons were also lacking a way to trace them.

There are also reloadable Smart Cards, and riders can use it to print tickets for themselves from an Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVMs). A seasonal ticket is available for regular commuters. Riders can choose the validity of these tickets from 1-month, three months to a year. Season Tickets are the most cost-effective and time-efficient option for regular commuters.

In 2022, the ATVM added new payment methods. Initially, it has only the Railway Smart Card payment option. But with the new payment methods, ticketing has become much faster. It has two features, first one is BHIM UPI QR CODE (Pay by Paytm) and the second one is BHIM UPI QR CODE (Pay by Freecharge). The process is very simple, we just have to select the destination station, where we want to go and then by selecting the QR CODE option, and the displayed QR CODE needs to be scanned through the passengers with the help of any of the payment application (like Gpay, Paytm, BharatPe, Phonepe, etc). and can further proceed by making the payment and getting the ticket in your hands. Smart cards can also be recharged similarly by placing the card on the slot and accessing the QR CODE for payment. And passengers are requested to make use of Digital QR CODE based payment facility in ATVMs installed at stations for hassle free cashless payments, saving time by avoiding queues at UTS counters. It may be noted that a discount of 0.5% can be availed on renewal of suburban season tickets using UPI QR CODE.
;Mobile app
The ticket counters usually have long queues. In order to bring a solution to this problem, the UTSOnMobile app was launched by railways minister Suresh Prabhu at Dadar railway station in December 2014. This app was launched initially for Android and Windows Phone, with the iOS version developed later.

After signing up, the user has the option to load the prepaid RWallet built in the app, using credit/debit cards, net banking, IMPS or private mobile-based apps. After the RWallet is loaded, the app can be used to book tickets on the entire network. Alternatively, the user may book tickets directly using credit/debit cards, net banking, IMPS, UPI, or various digital wallets such as PayTM, MobiKwik etc. for payments within the app without having to load the prepaid RWallet.

Initially, the ticket booked on the app had to be printed from the ATVMs. This step was found tedious by the commuters and was criticized. Later, in July 2015, an update for the app was launched, which made e-tickets acceptable. The update also brought technical changes, like, the tickets could be booked only within a radius of 30m to 5 km of the origin station, and not from the platform. This move was well received by commuters, which resulted in over 50,000 downloads on the launch day.

===Security===
The Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the Government Railway Police (GRP) are responsible for the Security of the Mumbai Suburban Railway.

The RPF is a security force under the authority of the Indian Ministry of Railways established by the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957 has the power to search, arrest, investigate and prosecute, though the ultimate power rests in the hands of the GRP.

The GRP is the main police force established by the &quot;Railways Act, 1989&quot;. The GRP&#x27;s responsibility is to observe law and order on all railway property. The force is under joint-control of the Indian Ministry of Railways and the Maharashtra Police. Its duties correspond to those of the District Police in the areas under their jurisdiction, such as patrolling, but only on railway property. It also aids and provides assistance to the Railway Protection Force.

==Safety issues==

===Doors===
The Mumbai Suburban Railway is known for its open doors and windows. This is because there is no ventilation system on the trains and the train relies on natural air ventilation. This was introduced as a cost-saving measure, as an air-conditioning system would be rendered useless during rush hour. Leaving the doors open also allows for a fast boarding process and turnaround time, as the trains stop for only 10 seconds, and are at most 5 minutes apart, to combat overcrowding. Passengers often end up hanging off the edge of the footboard, off door ledges, and during rush hour can lose balance and fall to their death. Teenagers and adults also attempt to perform stunts of the doorway and door ladders, thus risking their lives. Windows also have a wired grill on them, to prevent theft and chain snatching. However, passengers frequently spit &quot;paan&quot;, mava and gutka while hanging off doors, which ends up entering through the open window grilles. There are also numerous records of people tripping and falling down every day while getting on and off the train, when the train is in motion, thus resulting in injury.

===Overcrowding===
Due to its extensive reach across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, and its intensive use by the local urban population, the Mumbai Suburban Railway suffers from the most severe overcrowding in the world. Over 4,500 passengers are packed into a 12-car or 15-car rake during peak hours, as against the rated carrying capacity of around 2,000. This has resulted in what is known as &quot;Super-Dense Crush Load&quot; of 14 to 16 standing passengers per square metre of floor space.

===Fatalities===
On average, about 2,000 people are killed on the Mumbai Suburban Rail network; between 2002 and 2012, more than 36,152 people died and 36,688 people were injured. A record 17 people died every weekday on the city&#x27;s suburban railway network in 2008. Overcrowding is frequently blamed for the incidents. Another cause of death is passengers crossing the tracks on foot to avoid footbridges. Some passengers die when they sit on train roofs to avoid the crowds and are electrocuted by overhead electric cables, or fall while hanging from doors and window bars. Deaths declined in 2018. To reduce the risk of such fatalities, longer platforms, and more frequent trains are being implemented.

Central Railways in association with a behaviour architecture firm deployed psychology-based interventions at the Wadala station, reducing fatalities by about 75%.

In 2010, Western Railway has pledged that its trains will stop running if &quot;even a single person&quot; is seen travelling on the roof.

In mid-2011, a viral video depicted a youth performing stunts while dangling from the compartment of a Harbour Line train. Following this, a boy was killed while imitating the actions performed in the video.

The Western and Central Railways have been using the Auxiliary Warning System (AWS), a type of Train Protection &amp; Warning System (TPWS), since 1996, not dissimilar to the Automatic warning system of England.

The Central Railway and Western Railway introduced a Blue Light (Virtual Gate) concept, The Blue beam light unit which will be mounted on the top of each Gate, which Guide the Commuter for Safe Boarding, avoid overcrowding and Safe clearance in the Platforms. It also helps to create a Cultural Transformation in the Behavior of the Commuter.

===Terrorism===
The Mumbai Suburban Railway has suffered eight explosive attacks and around 368 people are believed to have died as a result.
* 12 March 1993 – Bomb blast at 
* 13 March 2003 – A bombing in a train in Mulund killed 20 people
* 11 July 2006 – A series of seven bombs in Western Railway trains killed 209 people
* 26 November 2008 – Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus was attacked during the 2008 Mumbai Attacks killing at least 60 people

===Tourism===
Tourist usage of the Mumbai Suburban Railways has seen popularity as a way to explore the day-to-day life of the city, and as such, the Central Railway has issued circulars advising tourists not to travel in the trains from 07:00 to 11:00 and 17:00 to 22:00 during weekdays because of overcrowding.

==Expansion==

To enable the Mumbai Suburban Railway to meet the demands of the ever-growing passenger traffic, the federal Government of India&#x27;s Ministry of Railways and the state Government of Maharashtra have jointly envisioned the constitution of a separate corporate entity to operate the system.

The Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC), a public sector unit of the Government of India under the Ministry of Railways, was incorporated under the (Indian) Companies Act, 1956 on 12 July 1999, with an equity capital of to implement the rail component of an integrated rail-cum-road urban transport project, called Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP). The cost of the rail component of the project is to be shared equally by the Ministry of Railways and the Government of Maharashtra.

MRVC under the Mumbai Urban Transport Project-II is completed the Harbour Line up to Goregaon. Further extension of this line has been accepted under MUTP-III till Borivali.

CR has constructed a line linking Nerul / CBD Belapur with Uran. The line would have 10 stations. This project is divided into two phases. 
* In Phase-I, Bamandongari and Kharkopar are fully operational and Targhar station is still under construction. But the construction of Sagar Sangam railway station is temporarily postponed due to completing the railway line within the time limit of October 2018 till the later phase.
* In Phase-II, the Construction of all stations lying between Kharkopar and Uran is completed &amp; flagged of by PM Narendra Modi on 12 January 2024.

CR has proposed a service from to , giving a boost to commuters to and from Nasik, since there are currently only three Intercity trains to Manmad (GLokmanya Tilak Terminus–Manmad Godavari Express, Panchvati Express and Manmad Rajya Rani Express) operating from Mumbai. This distance is 132 km regular, meeting the Indian Railways criteria for EMU services CR has announced that it will carry out trial runs, however it has difficulty due to the Kasara Ghat tunnels.

<doc id="375015" wikidata="Q139503" url="?curid=375015" title="Baie-D'Urfé">
<text>Baie-D&#x27;Urfé (, ; previously spelled Baie d&#x27;Urfé or Baie d&#x27;Urfee) is an on-island suburb of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is part of the West Island area of the Island of Montreal.

As part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal, Baie-D&#x27;Urfé was merged into the city of Montreal on January 1, 2002, joining with neighbouring Beaconsfield to create the borough of Beaconsfield–Baie-D&#x27;Urfé. After a change of provincial government in 2003 and a provincial referendum in 2004, Beaconsfield and Baie-D&#x27;Urfé both voted to demerge and were reconstituted as independent municipalities on January 1, 2006. However, they remain part of the urban agglomeration of Montreal.

==Toponymy==
Baie-D&#x27;Urfé is named after François-Saturnin Lascaris d&#x27;Urfé, a French Sulpician priest known as l&#x27;Abbé d&#x27;Urfé. He was the community&#x27;s first pastor, who was sent by the &quot;Gentlemen of Saint-Sulpice&quot; to serve as a missionary for the parish of Saint-Louis-du-Bout-de-l&#x27;Île (which was later renamed in his honour), a small community of settlers, soldiers, traders, and Indians.

The town&#x27;s name went through several typographical changes: prior to 2002, the town&#x27;s name was written as Baie-d&#x27;Urfé (no capital &quot;d&quot;); prior to 1969, place names in Quebec were not hyphenated; and prior to 1960, its original name was officially spelled Baie d&#x27;Urfée.

==Overview==

Baie-D&#x27;Urfé is largely a &quot;bedroom community&quot; that extends from Autoroute 40 to Lac Saint-Louis. It is composed of both a residential and industrial sector. The residential sector is characterized by a wide range of house types and sizes, all based on spacious lots. The residential section of the municipality has retained a rural charm, accentuated by its lack of sidewalks and limited commercial activity. It is a favourite spot for boaters, who use either the local yacht or boat clubs. The community is within the part of the Island of Montreal locally referred to as the West Island. North of Autoroute 20 and the CN and CP railway lines lies a modest-sized industrial park. The industrial park, covering approximately a third of the town&#x27;s land area, is somewhat isolated from the rest of the town, features its own off-hours security patrol, and is home to a number of large industrial firms&#x27; operations.

The town&#x27;s active community members participate in many of the town&#x27;s associated or private clubs, including the &quot;Baie-D&#x27;Urfé Curling Club&quot;. It competes with a few other suburbs for top spot in the rankings of highest average household incomes in Canada. The median income for a household in Baie-D&#x27;Urfé was $128,611, and the median income for a family was $194,335. Males had an average income of $112,882, compared to $62,245 for females.

== Demographics ==
According to the Office québécois de la langue française, Baie-D&#x27;Urfé has been officially recognized as a bilingual municipality since 2005-11-02.

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Baie-D&#x27;Urfé had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

There are six Town Councillors:
#Nadia Bissada 
#Tony Brown 
#Brigitte Chartrand 
#Stephen Gruber 
#Wanda Lowensteyn 
#Tom Thompson

Baie-D&#x27;Urfé is the first town in Canada to have a youth council; this consists of young people aged 10 years and up, and is entitled the Junior Council. It was established in 2008. The town celebrated its centennial in 2011, and the Junior Council re-enacted two of the town&#x27;s earliest council meetings (which had been held originally on July 18 and September 16, 1911, respectively).

<doc id="375019" wikidata="Q174386" url="?curid=375019" title="Vietnam Airlines">
<text>Vietnam Airlines () is the flag carrier of Vietnam. The airline was founded in 1956 and later established as a state-owned enterprise in April 1989. Vietnam Airlines is headquartered in Long Biên district, Hanoi, with hubs at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi and Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City. The airline flies 117 routes across 19 countries, excluding codeshared services.

From its inception until the early 1990s, Vietnam Airlines was a minor carrier within the aviation industry as it was hampered by a variety of factors including the socio-economic and political situation of the country. With the government&#x27;s normalization of relations with the United States, the airline could expand, improve its products and services, and modernize its ageing fleet. In 1996, the Vietnamese government brought together 20 service companies to form Vietnam Airlines Corporation, with the airline itself as the centrepiece. In 2010, the corporation was restructured into a limited liability company and renamed Vietnam Airlines Company Limited. A seven-seat management board, appointed by the Vietnamese Prime Minister, oversees the company.

As passenger transport constitutes its core activity, Vietnam Airlines plays a crucial role in the economic development of the country. It owns 100% of Vietnam Air Service Company – a regional airline in southern Vietnam and almost 99% of the low-cost carrier Pacific Airlines. In addition, the corporation earns revenue from airline catering and the maintenance and overhauling of aircraft through a number of its subsidiaries, including Vietnam Airlines Engineering Company and Vietnam Airlines Caterers. The company has also diversified its investments in the aircraft-leasing and airport ground-servicing industries, and is looking to manufacture aircraft components. It controls and operates a cargo division, Vietnam Airlines Cargo.

Vietnam Airlines became a member of SkyTeam in June 2010, making it the first Southeast Asian carrier to have joined that alliance. the State&#x27;s stake in Vietnam Airlines is 86.34%, All Nippon Airways holds 5.62%, being a strategic shareholder of the national flag carrier.

==History==
===Beginnings===

Vietnam Airlines has its origins in January 1956, when it was established by the North Vietnamese government under the name Vietnam Civil Aviation () following the nationalization of Gia Lam Airport. It was instituted after the government signed the Decree No. 666/TTg. Under the designation 919th Transport Air Force Regiment (), the airline was created as part of the air force for civilian purposes with support from both the Soviet Union and China; initially, its fleet consisted of two Lisunov Li-2s that were later replaced by two Ilyushin Il-14 and three Aero Ae-45s. This was due to an embargo that prohibited the airline from leasing and/or buying American technology or components.

The airline&#x27;s development and expansion was seriously hampered by the Vietnam War (1955–1975). Following the war, its first international destination was Beijing, followed by Vientiane in 1976. During that year, the airline was known as &quot;General Department of Civil Aviation in Vietnam&quot;, and began full operations; it carried around 21,000 passengers, one-third of whom were on international flights, and of cargo. In 1978, another important destination of Vietnam Airlines was added, with flights offered to Bangkok. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the expansion of the network to Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Manila and Singapore.


In 1990, the company initiated discussions regarding the incorporation of Western-built aircraft into the fleet. Later that year, however, the carrier had to cancel the acquisition of two Airbus A310s due to their use of US-manufactured engines. By July 1991, the airline struck a wet-lease agreement with Dutch lessor TransAvia. The aircraft involved was a Boeing 737-300, that arrived in Vietnam Airlines&#x27; livery. However, the aircraft was returned after the U.S. State Department pressured the Dutch lessor to remove the aircraft from Vietnam. Subsequently, Vietnam Airlines organized a similar but more complicated deal with TEA Basle, who spent the rest of 1991 negotiating a deal with US authorities. Eventually, a solution stating that &quot;[the Boeing 737] must be positioned outside Vietnam, with no logo or lettering of Vietnam Airlines. On these conditions, it could operate on behalf of Vietnam Airlines&quot; was reached. In December 1991, Cathay Pacific and Vietnam Airlines agreed on a 50–50 joint venture to operate between Hong Kong and Vietnam, as the airline&#x27;s Tupolev Tu-134 fleet did not meet Kai Tak Airport&#x27;s noise restrictions.

In October 1992, the Boeing 737 was supplemented with an Airbus A310. However, a dispute with Bulgarian Jes Air over who should pay for the repairs after the aircraft sustained an engine failure led to its replacement with another A310 from GATX, also operated by Jes Air. A similar dispute with United Technologies encouraged the airline to switch from Airbus to Boeing. Hence, a Boeing 767-200ER, leased from Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services (AWAS), arrived in January 1993, and a Royal Brunei Airlines Boeing 767-300ER, arrived the following year. In October 1993, the first Airbus A320-200 was incorporated over a two-year wet-lease contract with Air France. Vietnam Airlines by now had started discussions with Air France about a partnership, and the French carrier agreed to lease its Airbuses to Vietnam Airlines, and also to provide customer support and pilot/crew training. By that time the route network had further expanded internationally, seeing the incorporation of destinations such as Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei, Sydney, and Melbourne. In 1993, the airline carried 1.06 million passengers, 418,000 of whom were on international flights.

===New enterprise: 1993–2006===
The airline became the flag carrier of Vietnam in 1993, after having completed a restructuring programme that was started four years earlier. In that year, the airline split from the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV) and became a state enterprise. The move was similar to the reorganization of the Chinese CAAC Airlines into several regional airlines in 1987. Even though the airline gained some independence from the CAAV, it was still known as &quot;Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam&quot; within the 1993–1996 period. Also from 1993 to 1995, the 919th Air Force Regiment was eventually re-established as the &quot;Flight Crew Division 919&quot; () - the designation that is still being used by the Vietnam Airlines and its personnel until today - marking the carrier&#x27;s full transformation from a nominal military unit into a wholly civilian and commercial operator.

In February 1994, US President Bill Clinton lifted the trade embargo to allow Vietnam Airlines the ability to acquire Western-built aircraft. Consequently, Vietnam Airlines announced in April of the same year that it would be phasing out its inefficient Soviet planes. By April 1995, the fleet consisted of Airbus A320s (all of them leased from Air France), Antonov An-24s, ATR72s, Boeing 707-300s, Ilyushin Il-18s, Tupolev Tu-134s and Yakovlev Yak-40s; at this time the route network comprised domestic destinations (including Ban Me Thuot, Da Nang, Dien Bien Phu, Hue, Nha Trang, Phu Quoc and Pleiku) and international destinations (including Bangkok, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore). On , the airline, along with a number of other aviation-related businesses, were incorporated to establish &quot;Vietnam Airlines Corporation&quot;. Two Fokker 70s were purchased in mid-1995 for  million; they were aimed at partly replacing the Tupolev Tu-134 fleet on domestic routes as well as at serving as VIP transport. In December 1995, discussions with GECAS for the lease of additional, second-hand Boeing 767-300ERs were under way; these ex-Continental Airlines aircraft would act as a replacement for wet-leased Boeing 767 aircraft ( -300ERs and -200ER leased from AWAS and Royal Brunei) in the fleet.

In September 1996, Vietnam Airlines started offering business class services and in 1999, the airline launched its frequent-flyer program, Golden Lotus Plus; During 1996, Vietnam Airlines looked for aircraft which would substitute the A320s wet-leased from Air France when the deal was over. Apart from acquiring further A320s, the airline considered Boeing 737s and McDonnell Douglas MD-90s. In , GECAS delivered the of Boeing 767-300ER to the carrier, on dry-lease for years. In the same year, Boeing 767-300ERs and a Boeing 767-200, on lease from AWAS and Royal Brunei Airlines, respectively, were returned to the lessors, but in early 1997 another Boeing 767-300ER was phased in on a one-year lease from AWAS. With its freedom to operate Western-built aircraft, Vietnam Airlines considered the acquisition of long-haul aircraft to better service Vietnamese living overseas. The Airbus A340, Boeing 747 and the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 were topics of discussion. Meanwhile, two Fokker 70s were acquired in May and July to replace the twelve Tupolev Tu-134s. On 3 September 1997, the crash of a Tupolev Tu-134B, on approach to Phnom Penh Pochentong Airport in bad weather, resulted in more than fatalities.


A new livery was introduced in early 1998, initially unveiled on a Boeing 767.
In December 2001, Vietnam Airlines signed a historic agreement with Boeing for the acquisition of its first ever US-built aircraft, signalling the start of trade under the Bilateral Trade Agreement between the two countries. The deal involved four Boeing 777-200ERs. The transaction was valued at  million; the first aircraft was initially scheduled for delivery in 2003. These four aircraft, along with six others of the same type that are leased from International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), are the flagships of the airline, and serve on medium and long-haul routes, respectively. During that year, the airline carried 3.4 million passengers, 1.9 million of whom were on domestic flights; flights to Beijing resumed and services to Kunming were launched. During 2002, Vietnam Airlines considered a lease offer from Airbus for two Airbus A340-300s. On 4 September 2003, a landmark ceremony celebrated the airline&#x27;s receipt of its first Boeing 777-200ER purchased outright from Boeing. On 28 October, the airline decided to move its operations in Moscow from Sheremetyevo International Airport to Domodedovo International Airport.

In June 2005, Vietnam Airlines ordered four Boeing 787-8s. Twelve additional 787-8s were ordered in late 2007, some of them to be directly acquired from the company, and the rest to be purchased by the carrier&#x27;s subsidiary Vietnam Aircraft Leasing Company (VALC). These new aircraft were to allow Vietnam Airlines to expand its network and replace some leased aircraft. Regarding the delays from Boeing, CEO Pham Ngoc Minh remarked in September 2009, &quot;We are not happy about the constant delays. It affects our business plan. We expected to get our planes in 2009, then in 2010, and now nobody can confirm to us which is the exact delivery date. I can be patient but it gives us a lot of headaches.&quot; In 2010 the airline switched its Boeing 787 order from the to the model, stating that 787-8s did not meet all the requirements Boeing initially promised; it was expected that the airline would receive its first aircraft of the type in 2015.

On 20 June 2005, the airline launched direct services to Frankfurt after having discontinued services to Berlin. It came after the 2004–2005 period when travel between the two countries soared 70%. The following year, Vietnam Airlines was admitted into IATA. As part of the move, Vietnam Airlines had to meet the association&#x27;s IOSA safety standards.

===Expansion: 2007–current===
According to several newspaper reports in 2007, the Vietnamese government planned to partly privatize Vietnam Airlines. In the plan, the government considered selling 20–30% of the airline&#x27;s stake to outsiders, with the government holding the balance. This was a small part of a bigger proposal by the government to privatize its state-owned companies, due to be completed by 2010. Vietnam authorized the plan the following year; however, the plan was not carried out as the airline missed its deadline scheduled by the government, which was arranged for 2010, due to the Great Recession.

On 1 October 2007, the airline and VALC signed a memorandum of understanding for the purchase of ten Airbus A350 XWBs, and 20 additional Airbus A321s. The Airbus A350s will supplement the Boeing 787s already ordered by the airline. This single order will result in Vietnam Airlines becoming one of the largest Airbus operators in Asia. The two companies also ordered five extra ATR 72-500s in December 2007.

Vietnam was chosen as the host of Miss World&#x27;s 60th contest in 2008. As the country&#x27;s national airline, Vietnam Airlines was selected as the sponsoring airline for the beauty pageant. Therefore, it was tasked the job of managing all the transport matters for the contest, to be carried out during September and October, just before the beginning of the competition. However, it was later decided to carry out the event in Sanya, China, following speculations of Vietnam withdrawing. In , Vietnam Airlines added Nagoya, the airline point served in Japan besides Fukuoka, Osaka and Tokyo, to the route network.

In 2009, Vietnam Airlines and the Government of Cambodia established a joint-venture, having 49% and 51% stockholding, respectively, with the goal of boosting tourism in Cambodia. The joint-venture was a new Cambodian national airline named Cambodia Angkor Air, which started flying in July the same year, using ATR-72 aircraft; an Airbus A321 joined the fleet in September. Also in 2009, the carrier signed a deal for another 16 Airbus A321s plus two Airbus A350s, during the Paris Air Show. In addition, Vietnam Airlines launched a new bilingual website in to simplify bookings and adopted a new passenger service system designed by IT provider Sabre Airline Solutions.

On 26 August 2010, the airline teamed up with Boeing during the unveiling of its interior modernization programme to increase passenger comfort. From late September to early October, Vietnam Airlines discounted up to 85% of its 90,000 fares to celebrate Thang Long-Hanoi&#x27;s 1000th anniversary. In November 2010, the airline awarded Honeywell a  million contract to retrofit the Airbus A321s&#x27; aircraft flight systems, which is calculated to save Vietnam Airlines per aircraft per year.

In January 2011, plans were announced by the airline to re-initiate an initial public offering (IPO) by the end of 2012; an earlier attempt was stalled by the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Scheduled for mid-2014 after several delays, the IPO and subsequent share-offerings will supply the funds to expand Vietnam Airlines&#x27; fleet and network. With the company valued at  billion, the government plans to initially keep 75% of the shares. The IPO plan was submitted to the Vietnamese Ministry of Transport in June 2014. Scheduled to commence on 14 November 2014, the IPO received two submissions from foreign companies, but their names have not been disclosed. The corporation was scheduled to be restructured by 2015 to bring it in line with other state-owned enterprises and to shift its focus away from non-core businesses. Following restructuring, the airline group will consist of Vietnam Airlines itself, as well as three carriers; in total, the corporation will comprise 26 independently audited companies.

In February 2012, Vietnam Airlines boosted its stake in the low-cost carrier Jetstar Pacific Airlines to 70%, with Qantas holding the balance. The Vietnamese flag carrier was the major shareholder in Vietnam&#x27;s second largest airline, but its stake had been transferred to the Ministry of Finance, and subsequently to the Vietnamese State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC). The carrier&#x27;s takeover of SCIC&#x27;s stake in Jetstar Pacific will capitalise the low-cost carrier with  million, an amount that will be directed towards fleet renewal. In late April 2012, the aircraft lessor ALC announced the placement of an order for eight Boeing 787-9s, which will be leased to Vietnam Airlines; deliveries are expected to start in 2017. In late May 2012, the carrier signed an agreement with Vietnam&#x27;s Eximbank for a loan worth  million, which the carrier will use to finance the acquisition of four Airbus A321s; a further  million was loaned in April 2013 to finance the purchase of eight Boeing 787s. In a deal valued at  billion, Vietnam Airlines signed a contract with General Electric in October 2013 for 40 engines to power the Boeing 787 aircraft the airline had on order.

In July 2014, a new route to Tokyo-Haneda from Hanoi was introduced.

Vietnam Airlines received its first Airbus A350-900 in late June 2015, becoming the second operator of the type worldwide after Qatar Airways. In , the airline first Boeing 787-9 entered the fleet. In November 2018, the carrier received its first Airbus A321neo. Vietnam Airlines&#x27; participation in Cambodia Angkor Airlines ended in April 2020 when all the shares were sold to an undisclosed buyer, while acquiring all Qantas&#x27;s stake in Jetstar Pacific, eventually rebranding the carrier as Pacific Airlines in the same year. In November 2021, Vietnam Airlines started its first direct non-stop service to the United States, from Ho Chi Minh City to San Francisco.

==Corporate affairs and identity==
Vietnam Airlines Company Limited was a limited liability company wholly owned by the government of Vietnam, having been restructured from Vietnam Airlines Corporation in June 2010 and then formally became Vietnam Airlines Joint Stock Company in 2015, which is considered as a &quot;exceptional milestone&quot; by the airline. Its role is to provide economic gains to the country, as its tasks, in addition to scheduled passenger and cargo transport, include &quot;responsibility towards labor, contribution to the state budget, and providing chartered flights&quot;, according to former CEO Dao Manh Nhung. The airline is headed and overseen by a seven-seat management team, members of which are selected by the Prime Minister of Vietnam. As of September 2022, Dang Ngoc Hoa is the chairman of the company, whereas Le Hong Ha is the president and CEO. As of December 2019, the workforce of the Group numbered 21,255 employees with Vietnam Airlines itself employing 6,409 people. The airline is headquartered in the Long Bien District of Hanoi; previously it was headquartered at Gia Lam Airport in Gia Lam, Hanoi.

When Vietnam Airlines wholly owned Pacific Airlines after Jetstar&#x27;s withdrawal of stakes in this low-cost carrier, the corporation has started to use the term Vietnam Airlines Group to refer a group consisting of three airlines owned by Vietnam Airlines including Vietnam Airlines (itself), Pacific Airlines and Vietnam Air Services Company.

===Training===
In 2009, the airline, Airbus and ESMA Aviation Academy created Bay Viet Flight Training Company to train pilots in the country, with the expectation that up to 100 trainees would graduate annually. In October 2010, the company planned to train 60 pilots in Vietnam during 2011–2012. In 2010, Vietnam Airlines needed 636 pilots, 60% of whom were Vietnamese. It planned to raise that figure it to 75% by 2015, meaning there will be at least 100 recruits each year from 2010 until 2015. Vietnam Airlines also contracts CAE Global Academy Phoenix in Arizona, United States, to train its cadets.

===Financial performance===
Vietnam Airlines enjoyed an average of 37% increase in passengers flown per year the 1997 Asian financial crisis and other contributing causes led to a loss in profits for the airline. Nevertheless, the airline remained profitable throughout the crisis. In 1996, the airline carried 2.5 million passengers, up 18% from 1995. The airline carried more than 4 million passengers in 2002, which is an 18% increase over the previous year. Its cargo traffic also climbed 20% during the same period, resulting in a 2002 profit of US$35.77 million.

Despite the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, the airline posted a US$26.2 million profit for 2003. In 2006, it carried 6.8 million passengers (3.7 million international) and earned revenue of nearly US$1.37 billion (first 11 months). Vietnam Airlines carried more than 9 million passengers, of which 4 million were international travellers in 2007, the year which saw the airline earning a gross profit of US$23 million from a revenue of US$1.23 billion. It also transported 115,100 tonnes of cargo. In 2009, the airline&#x27;s revenue was US$1.3 billion, compared to US$1.56 billion it earned the previous year. During this period, Vietnam Airlines carried 9.3 million passengers. According to Anna.aero, Vietnam Airlines&#x27; passenger capacity for 2010 rose 30% over the same period of the previous year. This also coincided with the increase in capacity at Vietnamese airports, at 21%. In 2012, the company&#x27;s total revenue totalled US$2.4 billion, with profits totalling US$3.3 million. The following year, the carrier posted a  million gross profit.

Vietnam Airlines held about 40% of the market share of international passengers flying to and from Vietnam in February 2012. At the time, Vietnam Airlines controlled 77% share of the domestic aviation market, with 14% covered by Jetstar Pacific. As of December 2012, Vietnam Airlines controlled just below 70% of the domestic market share.

In July 2021, it was announced that Vietnam Airlines employees can buy 70 million shares as strategic shareholder ANA Holdings transferred 70 million shares to 15,100 employees of the Vietnam Airlines Group.

===Subsidiaries and affiliates===
Vietnam Airlines Group has at least 20 subsidiaries and affiliates. By the end of its restructuring in 2015, the company planned to have offloaded its stakes in more than 10 enterprises.

===Aircraft maintenance and production===
Vietnam Airlines is increasingly becoming involved in the maintenance, overhauling, and production of aircraft. Maintenance works are carried out by Vietnam Airlines Engineering Company (VAECO), which was established on 1 January 2009. VAECO was organized mainly upon the amalgamation of the A75 and A76 aircraft maintenance bases. VAECO carries out maintenance and technical services for Vietnam Airlines as well as for other airlines. The establishment of this company opens a new era to the aircraft maintenance field in Vietnam. As of 2013, VAECO was capable of performing a wide range of maintenance on many different aircraft types; this includes C-checks for the Boeing 777, Airbus A330, Airbus A320 and Airbus A321; and D-checks, the most thorough of all maintenance procedures, which are carried out on the ATR 72 and Fokker 70.

In addition to its self-maintenance facilities, Vietnam Airlines also has maintenance contracts with other airlines and maintenance organisations.

There are currently no production facilities in Vietnam for aircraft and spare parts. However, Boeing has managed to obtain 35% of the distribution market in Vietnam, and GE Aviation, in turn, supplies jet engines for the Boeing aircraft. In the future, conversely, Vietnam Airlines is planning to build a maintenance factory in conjunction with Rolls-Royce and other companies. It has also signed a memorandum of understanding with EADS, a pan-European aerospace and defence corporation, that would let the corporation assemble and manufacture plane components in the future.

==Destinations==
Vietnam Airlines has a network within Asia, North America, Europe and Oceania. With about 300 daily flights, the airline flies to 21 destinations domestically, and to 43 internationally. In addition, it has codeshare agreements with a number of airlines for other routes, some of which span to North America.

===Tết flights===
Vietnam Airlines has traditionally increased flights among Vietnamese cities to cater for the heavy demands brought by the annual Tết celebration. This busy period, which could fall anywhere from late January to mid-February, is Vietnam&#x27;s most important celebration; hundreds of extra flights are scheduled by domestic airlines during this period to allow Vietnamese to return to their families, often in rural areas, to celebrate the occasion. In 2010, the airline increased its seat capacity from 45% to 120% on certain domestic routes. In 2011, it increased additional flights on ten routes, adding more than 100,000 seats. About 63,000 of these seats were between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. This represented a remarkable 41% increase against normal days. In 2013, the carrier added an extra 174,000 seats during the celebratory period, of which 82,000 seats were on the trunk route between its primary hubs.

<doc id="375021" wikidata="Q5473413" url="?curid=375021" title="Operation Mountain Viper">
<text>In Operation Mountain Viper, the United States Army and the Afghan National Army (nearly 1000 in number) worked together from August 30 to early September, 2003, to uncover hundreds of suspected Taliban rebels dug into the mountains of Daychopan district, Zabul province, Afghanistan.

The Operation killed an estimated 124 militants. Five Afghan Army personnel were killed and seven were injured. One U.S. soldier died in an accidental fall and five were killed in an ambush on August 31, 2003.

The Operation worked in conjunction with Operation Warrior Sweep.

==Pre-Operational Phase==

After an exhaustive reconnaissance effort, it was determined that Anti-Coalition Militant (ACM) forces were organizing resistance efforts and conducting operations in the mountainous Deh Chopan district in the Zabul province of Afghanistan. This remote area is located roughly 150 miles northeast of Kandahar. United States Special Operations Forces (SOF) had been organizing and training elements of the Afghan Militia Forces (AMF) in the area. An AMF reconnaissance patrol along with its 5th Special Forces Group advisors came into contact with ACMs for the first time on 25 August 2003. Supported by coalition close air support the result of this initial contact was reported as 14 to 19 ACM killed in action, with no coalition losses. With the verification of strong ACM activity in the area, planning began for the initiation of a broader range of combat operations.

Five days following initial contact, the extensive combat operation known as Operation Mountain Viper began. A battalion task force consisting of two rifle companies of the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment (2/22), 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry), and attachments of civil affairs (CA), psychological operations (PSYOP), engineers, military police (MP), explosive ordnance disposal (EOD), and interpreters conducted an air assault into the region on 30 August. These elements were to clear about a dozen targets in a 10 kilometer by 6 kilometer area east of their landing zones. Reconnaissance Teams from 2/22 gathered intelligence and conducted surveillance in the high elevations guiding the infantry companies throughout the valley and providing sniper support. United States and French SOF along with AMF forces operated on the periphery providing a cordon to the objective area and directing attack aircraft. These SOF engaged ACM’s who attempted to move toward coalition landing zones. In one such engagement, which lasted in excess of two hours, another eight ACM were reported KIA. On 31 August as the entire task force mobilized, coalition platoons engaged ACM elements as they maneuvered through their objectives. Enemy losses in these skirmishes were not determined. In other skirmishes fought throughout the first two days of combat operations, roughly 30 more ACM were eliminated. By 7 September 2003, after two weeks of combat operations over 120 Anti Coalition Militants had been killed. Coalition forces suffered less than 15 casualties and only one American fatality. The U.S. serviceman (a member of the 5th SFG) was killed in an accidental fall.

==Problems Encountered==

Aerial Resupply had become a primary issue. With so many elements operating in such a narrow area, resupply aircraft often dropped resupply packages at the wrong LZ, despite marking procedures. Communications, due in large part to the mountainous terrain, were often difficult to maintain. Likewise, due to the amount of radio traffic on the battalion network, logistical, and administrative information were difficult to transmit. Due to the terrain, Movement was very time consuming, physically exhausting, and dangerous. Wheeled vehicle movement proved difficult and near impossible. It was determined, due to mission requirements, that standardization of the Individual Soldier Load would not suffice in actual combat operations and soldier specific modifications should be made. Fire Support Requests became difficult to process, lengthy, and difficult to clear, and generally difficult to receive. While company 60mm mortars were almost always in position to support their companies, the battalion 81mm Mortar Platoon was at times out of range to offer support. Rules of Engagement prior to the operation were difficult to understand for officers and senior NCOs and near impossible at the soldier level. At several times during the course of the operation the rules of engagement changed, and became even more confusing. The rules of engagement caused enough confusion that had a legitimate target been encountered, it may have meant the difference between a successful engagement and failure. The criteria for detaining suspicious or uncooperative civilians was also not very well defined. On at least one occasion, civilian detainees that were very suspicious had to be released because of improper processing. Confusing rules of engagement did not hinder, but complicated mission execution.

<text>The of Japanese light novels is written by Kouhei Kadono and illustrated by Kouji Ogata. It includes titles from different media, each connected by repeating characters and related plots. Presented in vignettes, each chapter presents the reader with only snapshots of what is happening, leaving them to find clues to understand the greater plot.

&quot;Boogiepop&quot; is best characterized as young adult fiction; by March 2000, two million copies of Kadono&#x27;s Boogiepop light novels works were in print. 

Kadono has published fourteen light novels and has serialized short stories in &quot;Dengeki hp&quot;, many of which have been published as a four-volume series about Pete Beat, a member of the Towa Organization. Two manga serials have been drawn for this series, which were serialized in &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; and &quot;Dengeki Animation&quot;. 

In 2000, the anime series &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; aired on Japanese television; a drama CD, featuring Kaori Shimizu, was released to promote this series. Later that year, the movie &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; was released. The anime and live action film were inspired by the original light novels and have also been released in English by The Right Stuf International, while Seven Seas Entertainment released four of the light novels and the manga.

== Synopsis ==
To face the &quot;enemies of the world&quot;, the &quot;shinigami&quot; Boogiepop automatically rises to the surface. In Boogiepop&#x27;s world, the Towa Organization, a shadowy group seeking to control humanity, managed to capture an alien organism who had taken the form of a highly evolved human. By studying him, the Towa Organization was able to create synthetic humans, people who have been artificially enhanced with special abilities. The mission of the Towa Organization and its agents is to find and kill MPLS, people who are more evolved than others and possess special abilities. However, Boogiepop will not let the Towa Organization get its way and he is not alone in his efforts.

The Boogiepop series is very much about the characters: their relationships, their pasts, their memories. This is especially true for how their pasts molded them into the people they are today. It can also be seen through scenes being presented from the perspective of different characters, and how the individual casts a different &quot;feel&quot; by how they relate to events. Another important theme is change. How the world changes and our different perceptions of this change, especially how one&#x27;s perception of things changes as they grow up. &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; is also highly metaphorical, with a character or an image representing much more than face value. It is also &quot;a show about the inter-related nature of people&#x27;s lives and the concept that they know of as time.&quot;

== Characters ==

Each Boogiepop title has its own cast of characters, and many of these characters will make appearances in more than one title, but there are only four central characters that are consistently at the center of the plot.

The shinigami whispered of among the female students of Shinyo Academy, few people know that Boogiepop actually exists. Normally dormant, Boogiepop rises to the surface when enemies of the world appear. Boogiepop&#x27;s appearance and voice are ambiguous: they seem both masculine and feminine at the same time. However, hidden beneath his signature black cloak and black, pipe-shaped hat, little is ever seen of him. Straight-faced and to the point, Boogiepop acts as mechanical as he claims to be. Boogiepop speaks in an archaic manner, and seems fond of whistling the prelude to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. In the 2019 anime adaptation Boogiepop speaks with a particular drawl that gives their speech an ironic, condescending air.

An ordinary, happy school girl at Shinyo Academy, Miyashita is in love with her boyfriend, Keiji Takeda, and close friends with Suema. Not particularly good at school, she does not stand out in any way. Unknown to most, she was hospitalized as a child, and this saw her life change, though even Miyashita herself does not seem to know the truth of what happened, and was simply told that she had been possessed by a kitsune. Unknowingly, when the world is in trouble, she carries a Spalding sports bag containing the effects of Boogiepop, her alternate personality. She has no recollection of her time as Boogiepop, and alters her memories to explain the blanks.

Known as the Fire Witch to many, Kirima has made few friends due to the way she distances herself from others: she knows that she is too dangerous for &#x27;normal&#x27; people to associate with. She has a messianic complex, and seeks to save the world from whatever may threaten it. As such, whenever there are unusual happenings within the city, Kirima can be found investigating what has happened. In the past, she had spent a period of time in hospital. A combination of the events from that period of her life, as well as the death of her father, the famous writer Kirima Seiichi, brought her to follow this path in life. Extremely gifted both physically and intellectually, she has the basic tools she needs to carry out her self-appointed mission.

As a result of a childhood trauma, Suema has developed an unusual fascination with criminal and abnormal psychology, as well as the desire to not let anything occur around her without her knowing. As a result of this, she desperately seeks the truth about the unexplained events happening in her city, and meddles with forces best left untouched. Good friends with Miyashita Touka, Suema appreciates how she so open and unconditionally accepting of her, and looks out for her friend. She seeks to be closer with Kirima Nagi, who seems to know the answers to the questions that have haunted her all these years. Despite her involvement in several incidents, she has yet to see Boogiepop in action.

==Media==

The series currently consists of 23 light novels, 3 four volume light novel spin-off series, a live-action movie, two anime television series, four manga serials, audio CDs, and other books. An oddity of the &quot;Boogiepop&quot; titles is that they are almost always made of more than one title, and often there is a mix of English and Japanese titles.

===Anime===
Marking the 20th Anniversary of Kouhei Kadono&#x27;s original novel debut, an anime television series adaptation was announced at the Dengeki Bunko 25th Anniversary &amp; New Work Unveiling Stage. The series was directed by Shingo Natsume and written by Tomohiro Suzuki, with animation by Madhouse. Hidehiko Sawada provided the character designs, while Kensuke Ushio composed the series&#x27; music. The series aired from January 4 to March 29, 2019, and was broadcast on AT-X and other channels. The series ran for 18 episodes. Myth &amp; Roid performed the series&#x27; opening theme song &quot;shadowgraph,&quot; while Riko Azuna performed the series&#x27; ending song &quot;Whiteout.&quot; Crunchyroll streams the series. Following Sony&#x27;s acquisition of Crunchyroll, the dub was moved to Crunchyroll. Named &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot;, the series adapts not only the titular novel, but also &quot;Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator&quot;, &quot;Boogiepop at Dawn&quot;, and &quot;Boogiepop Overdrive: The King of Distortion&quot;.

===Internationalization===
The Right Stuf International licensed &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; for English release in 2001. They dubbed the series and have distributed it in the US in both VHS and DVD formats. The series is distributed in the UK by ADV Films and across Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot; has also been localised and released in Argentina, Brazil, France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands.

In 2004, The Right Stuf International acquired the film &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot;. It has been released on DVD in Japanese with English subtitles, and is distributed in both the US and Europe, along with a director&#x27;s commentary and behind the scenes interviews with the cast.

In 2005, Seven Seas Entertainment announced they had acquired the rights to publish the &quot;Boogiepop&quot; novels and manga in English. Before 2018, they released the first three novels and the sixth, as well as the &quot;Boogiepop Doesn&#x27;t Laugh&quot; and the &quot;Boogiepop Dual&quot; manga. In 2019, Seven Seas Entertainment re-released the novels in an omnibus format, including the fourth and fifth novels in the series, &quot;Boogiepop in the Mirror&quot; and &quot;Boogiepop Overdrive&quot;, for the first time in English.

==Reception==
===Novels===
&quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; won the Fourth Dengeki Novel Prize in 1997 and was released in the Dengeki Book Collection in 1998 where it gained popularity. It is credited with popularizing light novels, as well as redefining young adult fiction in Japan. It was later adapted into a live action film by Ryu Kaneda, a two-volume manga by Kouji Ogata and served as the inspiration for a soundtrack composed by Yuki Kajiura. &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; also sets the scene for the anime &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot;, which has its backstory loosely based on the climax of the light novel. Having already gained a strong readership among high school and university age men, the release of &quot;Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1&quot; was met with overwhelming support. By the time the &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; film was released, the Boogiepop series was a bestseller, with over two million copies in print.

The &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; novel received favorable reviews, though these have mostly focused on the translation, which has been cited as &quot;a standard against which future Japanese novel translations are judged&quot;. It has also received praise for ripping &quot;the rules of narrative wide open&quot;, especially for how it allows the characters to grow on the reader. &quot;Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator Part 1&quot; continues receiving positive feedback for its easy-to-read style and excellent translation, as well as its use of atmosphere and characters. The main flaw, however, is the briefness of the title, which has clearly been used to set up the sequel.

===Anime===
The 2019 anime adaptation of &quot;Boogiepop&quot; received mostly positive reviews from Western journalists. Rose Bridges of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; reviewed the first four episodes, giving them an A− and writing, &quot;If &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; can keep this up, it might be a truly stellar adaptation. I just hope it doesn&#x27;t blaze so fast through these novels for us to keep up.&quot; Natasha H. of &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that while &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; doesn&#x27;t have the &quot;surreal and Lynchian horror&quot; of &quot;Boogiepop Phantom&quot;, &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; &quot;still holds its ground as a spooky and unnerving look into the emptiness of the human soul in contrast to society. Instead of going for a bleak first-person perspective, &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; presents alienation in from a third-person point of view. The result is an ongoing, chaotic, and jumbled narrative that leaves more questions than answers, until the very answer arrives, where things slowly are explained.&quot;

Brittany Vincent of &quot;Syfy&quot; wrote that &quot;if you&#x27;re in the mood to kick off a lengthy journey through a sometimes obtuse but wholly satisfying narrative that explores the supernatural, split personalities, and plenty of allegory, give &quot;Boogiepop and Others&quot; a chance. Don&#x27;t expect it all to make perfect sense right away, but let it wash over you. You&#x27;ll be glad that you did.&quot; &quot;Thrillist&quot; included the series on their list of the &quot;Best Anime of 2019,&quot; writing that the series &quot;could be best described as a slow-burn supernatural mystery thriller dotted with adrenaline-spiking sequences of horror, action, and suspense set against a backdrop of stunning metropolitan vistas.&quot;

<text>The Worshipful Company of Feltmakers is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The Feltmakers, or makers of felt hats, were incorporated by letters patent granted by James I in 1604. They received an extended royal charter in 1667. The company gradually lost its role as a trade association for felt hat makers, due to both advancements in technology and the increased popularity of silk hats. Like a majority of Livery companies, the Feltmakers&#x27; Company is now primarily a charitable institution, but has a number of milliners amongst its members.
The Feltmakers&#x27; Company ranks sixty-third in the order of precedence for livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Decus Et Tutamen&quot;, a Latin phrase taken from Virgil meaning &quot;An Ornament and a Safeguard.&quot; (The phrase also appears around the milled edge of certain pound coins.)

The company&#x27;s Master is Jeremy Bedford, who was installed as Master on 4 October 2024. Masters normally serve for one year. The company&#x27;s Upper Warden is Simon Millar.

<text>An illustrator is an artist who specializes in enhancing writing or elucidating concepts by providing a visual representation that corresponds to the content of the associated text or idea. The illustration may be intended to clarify complicated concepts or objects that are difficult to describe textually, which is the reason illustrations are often found in children&#x27;s books.

Illustration is the art of making images that work with something and add to it without needing direct attention and without distracting from what they illustrate. The other thing is the focus of the attention, and the illustration&#x27;s role is to add personality and character without competing with that other thing.

Illustrations have been used in advertisements, architectural rendering, greeting cards, posters, books, graphic novels, storyboards, business, technical communications, magazines, shirts, video games, tutorials, and newspapers. A cartoon illustration can add humour to certain stories or essays.

==Techniques==

Use reference images to create scenes and characters. This can be as simple as looking at an image to inspire your artwork or creating character sketches and detailed scenes from different angles to create the basis of a picture book world. Some traditional illustration techniques include watercolor, pen and ink, airbrush art, oil painting, pastels, wood engraving, and linoleum cuts.

John Held, Jr. was an illustrator who worked in a variety of styles and media, including linoleum cuts, pen and ink drawings, magazine cover paintings, cartoons, comic strips, and set design, while also creating fine art with his animal sculptures and watercolor, many established illustrators attended an art school or college of some sort and were trained in different painting and drawing techniques.

Traditional illustration seems to have made a resurgence in the age of social media thanks to social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and YouTube. Currently traditional and digital illustration are both flourishing.

Universities and art schools offer specific courses in illustration (for example in the UK, a BA (Hons) Degree) so this has become a new avenue into the profession. Many illustrators are freelance, commissioned by publishers (of newspapers, books, or magazines) or advertising agencies. Most scientific illustrations and technical illustrations are also known as information graphics. Among the information graphics, specialists are medical illustrators who illustrate human anatomy, often requiring many years of artistic and medical training.

A particularly popular medium with illustrators of the 1950s and 1960s was casein, as was egg tempera. The immediacy and durability of these media suited illustration&#x27;s demands well. The artwork in both types of paint withstood the rigors of travel to clients and printers without damage.

Computer illustration, or digital illustration, is the use of digital tools to produce images under the direct manipulation of the artist, usually through a pointing device, such as a tablet or a mouse.

Computers dramatically changed the industry and today, many cartoonists and illustrators create digital illustrations using computers, graphics tablets, and scanners. Software such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Corel Painter, and Affinity Designer are now widely used by those professionals.

<doc id="375029" wikidata="Q357179" url="?curid=375029" title="Elvin Jones">
<text>Elvin Ray Jones (September 9, 1927 – May 18, 2004) was an American jazz drummer of the post-bop era. Most famously a member of John Coltrane&#x27;s quartet, with whom he recorded from late 1960 to late 1965, Jones appeared on such albums as &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;, &quot;Ascension&quot; and &quot;Live at Birdland&quot;. After 1966, Jones led his own trio, and later larger groups under the name &quot;The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine&quot;. His brothers Hank and Thad were also celebrated jazz musicians with whom he occasionally recorded. Elvin was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1995. In his &quot;The History of Jazz&quot;, jazz historian and critic Ted Gioia calls Jones &quot;one of the most influential drummers in the history of jazz&quot;. He was also ranked at Number 23 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Drummers of All Time&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Elvin Jones was born in Pontiac, Michigan, to parents Henry and Olivia Jones, who had moved to Michigan from Vicksburg, Mississippi. His elder brothers were pianist Hank Jones and trumpeter Thad Jones, both highly regarded musicians. By age two, he said, drums held a special fascination for him. He would watch the circus parades go past his home as a child, and was particularly excited by the marching band drummers. Following this early passion, Elvin joined his high school&#x27;s black marching band, where he developed his foundation in rudiments.

==Career==

=== 1946–1949: Military service ===
Jones served in the United States Army from 1946 to 1949. With his mustering-out pay (and an additional $35 borrowed from his sister), Jones purchased his first drumset.

===1949–1960: Professional musician beginnings===
Jones began his professional career in 1949 with a short-lived gig in a club on Detroit&#x27;s Grand River Street. Eventually he went on to play with artists including Billy Mitchell and Wardell Gray. In 1955, after a failed audition for the Benny Goodman band, he found work in New York City, joining Miles Davis and Charles Mingus for their &quot;Blue Moods&quot; album on Mingus&#x27;s co-owned Debut label. During the late 1950s, Jones was a member of the Sonny Rollins trio that recorded most of the album &quot;A Night at the Village Vanguard&quot;, an album cited as a high point for both Rollins and for 1950s jazz in general.

===1960–1966: Association with John Coltrane===
In 1960, he began playing with John Coltrane. By 1962, he had become an integral member of the classic John Coltrane Quartet along with bassist Jimmy Garrison and pianist McCoy Tyner. Jones and Coltrane would often play extended duet passages. This band is widely considered to have redefined &quot;swing&quot; (the rhythmic feel of jazz), in much the same way that Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and others had done during earlier stages of jazz&#x27;s development. Jones said of that period playing with Coltrane: &quot;Every night when we hit the bandstand—no matter if we&#x27;d come five hundred or a thousand miles—the weariness just dropped from us. It was one of the most beautiful things a man can experience. If there is anything like perfect harmony in human relationships, that band was as close as you can come.&quot;

Jones stayed with Coltrane until early 1966. By then, Jones was not entirely comfortable with Coltrane&#x27;s new direction, especially as his polyrhythmic style clashed with the &quot;multidirectional&quot; approach of the group&#x27;s second drummer, Rashied Ali. &quot;I couldn&#x27;t hear what was going on... I felt I just couldn&#x27;t contribute.&quot;
===Post-Coltrane career===
Jones remained active after leaving the Coltrane group, and led several bands in the late 1960s and 1970s that are considered influential groups. Notable among them was a trio formed with saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist Joe Farrell and (ex-Coltrane) bassist Jimmy Garrison, with whom he recorded the Blue Note albums &quot;Puttin&#x27; It Together&quot; and &quot;The Ultimate&quot;. Jones recorded extensively for Blue Note under his own name in the late 1960s and early 1970s with groups that featured prominent as well as up and coming musicians. The two-volume &quot;Live at the Lighthouse&quot; showcases a 21- and 26-year-old Steve Grossman and Dave Liebman, respectively. Jones also played on many albums of the &quot;modal jazz era&quot;, such as &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; with McCoy Tyner and &quot;Speak No Evil&quot; with Wayne Shorter.

Beginning in the early 1980s, Jones performed and recorded with his own group, the Elvin Jones Jazz Machine, whose lineup changed through the years. Both Sonny Fortune and Ravi Coltrane, John Coltrane&#x27;s son, played saxophone with the Jazz Machine in the early 1990s, appearing together with Jones on &quot;In Europe&quot; on Enja Records in 1991. His final recording as a band leader, &quot;The Truth: Heard Live at the Blue Note&quot;, recorded in 1999 and issued in 2004, featured an enlarged version of his Jazz Machine—Antoine Roney (sax), Robin Eubanks (trombonist), Darren Barrett (trumpet), Carlos McKinney (piano), Gene Perla (bass), and guest saxophonist Michael Brecker. In 1990 and 1992, the Elvin Jones Jazz Machine partnered with Wynton Marsalis, performing at The Bottom Line in New York. Among his last recordings was accompanying his brother, pianist Hank Jones, and bassist Richard Davis on an album titled &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; under the name The Great Jazz Trio.

Other musicians who made significant contributions to Jones&#x27;s music during this period were baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams, tenor saxophonists George Coleman and Frank Foster, trumpeter Lee Morgan, bassist Gene Perla, keyboardist Jan Hammer and jazz–world music group Oregon.

In 1969, Jones played drums for beat poet Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s 1970 LP &quot;Songs of Innocence and Experience&quot;, a musical adaptation of William Blake&#x27;s poetry collection of the same name.

He appeared as the villain Job Cain in the 1971 musical Western film &quot;Zachariah&quot;, in which he performed a drum solo after winning a saloon gunfight.

Jones, who taught regularly, often took part in clinics, played in schools, and gave free concerts in prisons. His lessons emphasized music history as well as drumming technique. In 2001, Jones was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.

==Death==
Elvin Jones died of heart failure in Englewood, New Jersey, on May 18, 2004. He was survived by his first wife Shirley, children: Elvin Nathan Jones and Rose-Marie Jones, and his second common-law wife Keiko Okuya.

==Influence==

Jones&#x27;s sense of timing, polyrhythms, dynamics, timbre, and legato phrasing helped bring the drumset to the foreground. In a 1970 profile published in &quot;Life Magazine&quot;, Albert Goldman dubbed Jones &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest rhythm drummer&quot;, and his free-flowing style was a major influence on many leading drummers, including Christian Vander (Magma), Mitch Mitchell (whom Jimi Hendrix called &quot;my Elvin Jones&quot;), Ginger Baker, Bill Bruford, John Densmore (The Doors), Brian Viglione (Dresden Dolls and Violent Femmes) (for whom Elvin was his principal inspiration from age 11), and Janet Weiss.

<text>In Britain, a brass band (known regionally as a silver band or colliery band) is a musical ensemble comprising a standardized range of brass and percussion instruments. The modern form of the brass band in the United Kingdom dates back to the 19th century, with a vibrant tradition of competition based around communities and local industry, with colliery bands being particularly notable. The Stalybridge Old Band, for example, first performed in 1815 and is still in existence, although it did not become a brass band until the 1840s.

Bands using the British instrumentation are the most common form of brass band in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and are also widespread in continental Europe, Japan and North America. The tradition for brass bands in the UK is continuing, and local communities and schools have brass bands. British band contests are highly competitive, with bands organized into five sections much like a football league. Competitions are held throughout the year at local, regional, and national levels, and at the end of each year there are promotions and relegations. The 2019 holder of the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain was the Cory Band from South Wales.

A selection of brass bands can be experienced at the annual Durham Miners&#x27; Gala. There are also hotly-contested annual events held on Whit Friday in the Saddleworth area of Greater Manchester in which hundreds of bands compete.

==Etymology==
The terms &quot;brass band&quot; and &quot;silver band&quot; are synonymous in that the vast majority of bands termed either &quot;brass&quot; or &quot;silver&quot; incorporate musicians playing a mix of lacquered brass and silver-plated instruments. However, in the days when plain or lacquered brass instruments were not as costly as silver-plated ones, the term &quot;silver band&quot; implied an ensemble that could afford the latter and were thus perceived to be more successful. With the cost of each type now being similar, the distinction between brass and silver bands is generally not made. There are, however, some brass bands which carried the name &quot;silver prize band&quot; as a result of their successes in contests and competitions. As time went on, some kept the name &quot;silver&quot; but not necessarily the instruments. Nowadays, the only real difference is that silver bands are located mainly in the south of England and brass bands in the north, although some silver bands do still exist in the North and many brass bands exist in the South.

==Instrumentation==
British brass bands are limited to specific instruments, excluding, for instance, trumpets and French horns, which are found in orchestras and concert bands.

The standard instrumentation is as follows:
* 1 soprano cornet (E♭)
* 9 cornets (B♭) –
** Front row: one principal cornet, three solo cornets
** Back row: one repiano cornet, two 2nd cornets, two 3rd cornets
* 1 flugelhorn (B♭)
* 3 tenor horns (E♭) called alto horn in many countries – solo, 1st, 2nd
* 2 baritone horns (B♭) – 1st, 2nd
* 2 tenor trombones (B♭) – 1st, 2nd
* 1 bass trombone (B♭)
* 2 euphoniums (B♭)
* 2 E♭ basses, also known as E♭ tubas
* 2 B♭ basses, also known as B♭ tubas
* 2 to 4 percussion

The above totals 27–29 players, although in practice a band often has fewer than this. Spare seats may be filled for concerts and contests by players brought in from other bands, commonly known as &quot;deputising players&quot; or &quot;deps&quot;.
=== Notation ===
With the exception of percussion, bass trombone and some older tenor trombone music, all parts are transposing and written in the treble clef with the instrument&#x27;s lowest open note (B♭ or E♭) notated as middle C. This means that for every valved instrument, from the basses to the soprano cornet, a given note on the stave corresponds to the same valve fingering, enabling players to move more easily between parts. This system is unique to UK-style brass bands, though historically the North American drum and bugle corps activity followed the brass band convention of all-treble-clef writing.

Tenor trombone music is usually in treble clef like the other instruments in the band, though older scores or marches sometimes use tenor clef.

Bass trombone music is written at concert pitch in bass clef. This was historically due to this part being taken by a G bass trombone, rather than the modern B♭ bass trombone. As instrument technology modernized, the need for a bass trombone in G diminished, with the introduction of the B♭ bass trombone with F rotary valve. The larger bore and open wrap of the F valve gave the B♭ bass trombone a lower available playing register than the straight G bass trombone.

Tuned percussion is written in concert pitch (with the appropriate octave transpositions) with the appropriate clef for the instrument – e.g. bass clef for timpani, treble clef for glockenspiel (sounding two octaves higher). Unpitched percussion parts (including drum kit) are written in neutral clef on a 1- to 5-line stave using standard percussion notation, though some older scores may use bass and/or treble clefs.

===History===

The rise of brass bands in nineteenth-century Britain owed much to industrialisation, armed conflict, and improvements to instrument designs. Village and church ensembles had existed in the eighteenth century, while military bands, which featured a mix of woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments, proliferated during the Napoleonic Wars. The British Army began experimenting with all-brass bands from the late 1810s; the first civilian brass bands, featuring instruments such as keyed bugles, trumpets and trombones, emerged by the end of the 1820s. These early brass ensembles were often organised by former regimental musicians: the Waterloo veteran James Sanderson led a &#x27;military brass band&#x27; in Leamington Spa and Warwick in 1829.

Wind and brass bands enjoyed the support of industrial employers who sponsored bands to promote discipline, community spirit, and temperance among their workers. The advent of Adolphe Sax&#x27;s valved brass designs, which were easier to play and produced a more accurate, consistent sound, also helped fuel the growth of the brass band movement from the 1840s. Arguably brass bands were an expression of the local solidarity and aspirations of newly formed or rapidly growing communities. This was seen, for instance, in the creation of large-scale brass band competitions by the late 1850s. In 1853 John Jennison, owner of Belle Vue Zoological Gardens in Manchester, agreed to stage the first British open brass band championships. The event was attended by a crowd of over 16,000 and continued annually until 1981. Brass bands reached their peak in the 1890s, when there were around 5,000 brass bands in the country. Today, there are 1,200 brass bands in Britain with around 30,000 players.

Many British bands were originally either works bands or sponsored by various industrial concerns. This was particularly evident in coal mining areas, for example, bands such as the Grimethorpe Colliery Band and Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band in Yorkshire. Bands sponsored by factories include The Black Dyke Mills Band, Yorkshire Imperial Band (originally the Yorkshire Copperworks Band), Foden&#x27;s sponsored by the truck manufacturer, Fairey sponsored by the aircraft manufacturer, and Leyland Band sponsored by the vehicle manufacturer. One of the reasons for this was to keep the workers from organizing in radical groups. With the decline of these industries several bands have dissolved and others now draw their membership from other industries and other parts of the community. The Brighouse and Rastrick Band, is unique in having operated continually at the highest level without sponsorship, drawing its income from regular concerts, public donations and sales of recordings and merchandise.

The leading bands in Wales include the Cory Band, Tredegar Town Band and Tongwynlais Temperance Band The leading bands in Scotland are The Cooperation Band (formally Co-operative Funeralcare), Whitburn Band and the Kirkintilloch Band. All these bands compete at the highest level in the banding movement. In Northern Ireland the Brass Band League currently has 26 members.
There are also many non-contesting or &#x27;community&#x27; brass bands in the UK providing entertainment for audiences and enjoyment for musicians of all ages.

=== Contesting in the United Kingdom ===

British banding is highly competitive, with bands organized into five sections much like a football league – Championship section, 1st section, 2nd section, 3rd section and 4th section. Competitions are held throughout the year at local, regional, and national levels, and at the end of each year there are promotions and relegations.

At a national level the main contest is the National Brass Band Championship, and this determines a band&#x27;s section. For this, the UK is split into 8 regions: London and Southern Counties, Midlands, North of England, North West, Scotland, Wales, West of England, and Yorkshire. Each year in Spring the bands compete in a regional contest for their section, and the top two or three in each section go on to the &quot;National Finals&quot; in Autumn. Recently (2011), the finals for Sections 1 to 4 have been held in Cheltenham, and the finals for the Championship Section at the Royal Albert Hall in London (as featured in the film &quot;Brassed Off&quot;).

The bands are awarded points for their result (1st gets 1 point, 9th gets 9 points), and this is added to the previous two years to give a three-year total. Two or three bands with the best total are promoted, and two or three bands are relegated.

There are also separate contests for university brass bands, including the annual UniBrass contest, founded at Lancaster University in 2010 and hosted in 2023 by the University of Warwick. The Cambridge and Oxford University brass bands also compete against each other in annual &#x27;varsity&#x27; contests.
The National Youth Band Brass Championships held annually has a Youth Champs&#x27; non-competitive section offering the opportunity for young people new to brass to take part and contribute a performance without the pressure of competition. Bands of all standards play in the Debut Section and join in the fun.

==The Salvation Army==

In the UK, the brass bands of The Salvation Army have run parallel to the main brass band movement since the 1870s. Bands of The Salvation Army range from small church bands to staff bands composed of the best bandsmen of The Salvation Army in the area. Their instrumentation is almost identical except for a minor difference in the cornet section whereby the repiano is dropped and the remainder of the row is made up of parts designated 1st and 2nd (two players each) rather than 2nd and 3rd; and that some major pieces have a split first trombone part, the lower part usually cued elsewhere in the band. Bands of The Salvation Army can be found in most countries around the world in which it operates.

==Australia==
The Australian derivation of a brass band is the same as the UK brass band (i.e. standard instrumentation with no woodwind). Contesting bands in Australia are graded from A Grade to D Grade. National Contests are held each year at Easter, with the location moving from state to state, and often including bands from New Zealand or other locations around the Asia Pacific region.

Each state also conducts their own championships. National and state contests are generally of the same format: a set test piece for each grade, a hymn, an own choice, a stage march (march or concert march performed on the stage without marching) and a light entertainment concert program. Smaller regional contests often replace the major works with an own choice concert program.

Among the country&#x27;s most famous brass band identities have been conductor and composer Percy Code; and David King and Frank Wright who made their mark in Britain. Early Australian brass composers include Thomas Bulch, Alex Lithgow and Charles Trussell. In later years, leading composers have included Brenton Broadstock (&quot;Winds of Change&quot;, &quot;Rutherford Variations&quot;, &quot;Valiant Take All My Sins Away&quot; and many more), Barrie Gott (&quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot;, &quot;Gospel Train&quot;, &quot;Glasshouse Sketches&quot;) and Joe Cook (&quot;Taskforce&quot;, &quot;Keighley Moor&quot;).

==Europe==
===Belgium===
In Belgium, there are about 30 brass bands. The best known is Brass Band Willebroek, who were crowned European Brass Band Champions in 1993, 2006 and 2007. The average banding level is still rising, as the brass movement was only introduced in Belgium some 30 years ago.

The national brass band Championships are held annually at CC Zwanenberg in Heist-Op-Den-Berg. The winner represents Belgium at the European Championships.

Participants are divided into four categories going from Championship section to third section. Currently there are seven bands competing in Championship section. These are: Brass Band Willebroek Brass Band Buizingen, Metropole Brass Band, Festival Brass Band, Kortrijk Brass Band, Brass Band Heist, and De Noord-Limburgse Brassband,

Other Belgian bands include: Mercator Brassband, Brassband Kempenzonen Tielen, Brass Band Leieland, Brass Band Zele, Brass Band De Kempengalm, Brass Band de Thudinie and many more.

Some of the brass bands in Belgium are primarily based around recreational music, do not conform to British brass band instrumentation, and therefore do not compete.

===Germany===
Brass bands in Germany are not as widespread as in other European countries like Switzerland or the Netherlands.
There are just a few bands (about 40) playing in authentic British instrumentation. This is primarily due to the popularity of wind bands, particularly in Southern Germany, and brass groups (composed of soprano to bass instruments) known as &quot;Posaunenchöre&quot; (trombone choirs) related to churches.

National Brass Band &quot;competitions&quot; took place as part of the German Festival of Wind Music in Würzburg 2007 and 2008, in Duisburg 2010, in Coesfeld 2012 and in Bad Kissingen 2014.

===Ireland===
Brass bands in Ireland can primarily trace their origins to the past influence of British Army bands during the period between 1801 and 1922. As well as military bands however, community led groups were also in existence around this time. While concert bands are more prevalent today, possibly due to the association of brass bands with British rule, brass bands are still popular, especially on the east coast. Dungarvan, Arklow and Drogheda are all examples of towns with brass bands of note. Dublin has a number of Brass Bands. The oldest is the Blanchardstown Brass Band (Blanchardstown) formed in 1826, St.Georges Brass Band Formed 1936 (in Dublin City Centre) and the Stedfast Brass Band (Blackrock)
Brass competitions take place annually, both regionally and nationally.

===Netherlands===
In the years 1870–1900 the Salvation Army spread out their missionary activities in the Netherlands, at first the main port city Amsterdam, and then to the then still important northern seaport of Harlingen, Friesland around the 1900.

Brass Band contesting began in Friesland after World War II. The Frisian conductor Sierd de Boer made a great effort to develop the British Brass Band standardisation, and the Frisians nowadays continue to set the standard of brass bands in the Netherlands. Brass Bands in Friesland include
&quot;De Wâldsang&quot; Buitenpost, &quot;Pro Rege&quot; Heerenveen, &quot;De Bazuin&quot; Oenkerk and &quot;De Spijkerpakkenband&quot; Opsterland. Other well known brass bands across the country are Brassband Rijnmond (Rotterdam) and Brass Band Schoonhoven.

===Norway===
The Norwegian Band Federation is the largest voluntary music organisation in Norway. Through their membership, the 1712 member bands with their 70,318 players (official figures as of 9/1/04) are offered good conditions for their hobby. A network rich in tradition also gives them a strong and influential position in the cultural life of Norway. Many primary schools have their own bands.

Crown Prince Haakon is the patron of the Norwegian Band Federation. The Federation is granted an annual audience with the Crown Prince in order to report to him and receive advice for the future. The King has awarded a royal trophy to the championships for adult bands.

==North and South America==
===Canada===
Brass bands in the British tradition, sometimes sponsored by employers, existed in Canada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The geography of Canada (e.g. large distances between communities, making regular contests and migration of players difficult) was a key factor among many challenges that led to the demise of most such bands.

Today, excepting the Salvation Army bands, there are few British-style brass bands in Canada. Most operate as recreational, amateur, &quot;community&quot; bands such as the Oshawa Civic Band, King Street Brass from Kitchener, and the Whitby Brass Band, who celebrated their 160th anniversary in 2023. There are some semi-professional groups, like the Intrada Brass of Oakville, Ontario and the Weston Silver Band of Toronto. One of the most successful brass bands in Canada is the Hannaford Street Silver Band.

There are hopes for growth in the education field of brass bands in Canada, and in particular southern Ontario. In 1999, the professional Hannaford Street Silver Band launched the Hannaford Street Youth Band, which is internationally recognized for its success. In 2005, another youth band was created for beginning brass players known as the Hannaford Junior Band. Beginning in September 2006, the Hannaford organization plans to launch a third, intermediate, band known as the Hannaford Community Youth Band. These three ensembles target a wide range of youth from ages 11 to people well into their twenties.

===Latin America===
Brass bands long enjoyed popularity in many parts of Latin America as well.

Mexican banda music has similar origins to the British brass band tradition and was influenced by it in its early days. In 19th century Mexico very large bands were formed, such as that of composer Juventino Rosas and in parts of Mexico brass band concerts remain a popular entertainment.

===United States===

Brass bands in the British tradition are becoming more popular through the efforts of the North American Brass Band Association (NABBA), which organizes an annual brass band convention and set piece style contest. The US Open Brass Band Championships are held in early November and serves as the countries leading entertainment competition. Brass Band Festivals such as The Great American Brass Festival, Ohio Brass Arts Festival, Gettysburg Brass Band Festival, Dublin Festival of Brass, Mid-Atlantic Brass Festival, and Texas Brass Fest occur throughout the year.

Brass bands were very popular throughout the United States in the late 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century. Well known bands of virtuoso musicians toured widely, and most towns had their own bands that put on weekend music concerts. One notable example of this was The Ohio State University Marching Band which formed in 1879 and still performs with only brass and percussion instruments. Other groups, ranging from benevolent societies to large factories, would often have a band. The brass band movement has undergone a resurgence in the late twentieth century, led by the North American Brass Band Association. The United States boasts two professional brass bands, the Brass Band of Battle Creek and the River City Brass Band, as well as community brass bands such as the Dallas Brass Band, Central Ohio Brass Band, Dublin Silver Band, Motor City Brass Band, Atlantic Brass Band, Nebraska Brass Band, Imperial Brass, The Chesapeake Silver Cornet Brass Band (Delaware), Five Lakes Silver Band, Allegheny Brass Band, The Brass Band of Central Florida, the Sheldon Theatre Brass Band (Red Wing, MN), the Lake Wobegon Brass Band (Anoka, MN), the Twin Cities Brass Band (Bloomington, MN), the Fountain City Brass Band, the Triangle Brass Band, the Smoky Mountain Brass Band the River Brass, and the Mission Peak Brass Band (Fremont, CA), and the Rockville Brass Band (the oldest competing American band in Maryland, founded in 1976); several collegiate brass bands, including the James Madison University Brass Band, the Mansfield University Brass Band, the Slippery Rock University Brass Ensemble, the Pennwest-Clarion University Brass Ensemble, and the University of Georgia British Brass Band; and various youth brass bands, including the Triangle Youth Brass Band and the Fountain City Youth Brass Bands also exist.

==Repertoire==
There are several notable composers in the brass band world. The current favourite is possibly Philip Sparke, who has written many pieces, including &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot;. A noted Welsh Composer was T. J. (Tom) Powell, born in Tredegar in 1897, also known as &quot;The Welsh Sousa&quot;. Powell composed over 500 pieces for brass bands, including marches (such as &quot;The Castle Marches&quot;), tone poems and suites.

== Outdoor banding ==
An advantage of the brass band is that it is mobile and capable of playing at any time and anywhere, even on the march. Marching and outdoor functions have been the preserve of the brass band for well over a century. Many UK brass bands are closely woven into the local community, performing outdoor civic duties throughout the year.

The bandstand became popular in the Victorian era, typically associated with the British brass band or military band. It is a simple construction which not only creates an ornamental focal point, but also serves acoustic requirements whilst providing shelter from the changeable British weather.

<doc id="375033" wikidata="Q1191963" url="?curid=375033" title="Trigonometric substitution">
<text>In mathematics, a trigonometric substitution replaces a trigonometric function for another expression. In calculus, trigonometric substitutions are a technique for evaluating integrals. In this case, an expression involving a radical function is replaced with a trigonometric one. Trigonometric identities may help simplify the answer. Like other methods of integration by substitution, when evaluating a definite integral, it may be simpler to completely deduce the antiderivative before applying the boundaries of integration.

==Case I: Integrands containing &quot;a&quot;2 − &quot;x&quot;2==
Let formula_1 and use the identity formula_2

===Examples of Case I===
====Example 1====
In the integral

formula_3

we may use

formula_4

Then,
formula_5

The above step requires that formula_6 and formula_7 We can choose formula_8 to be the principal root of formula_9 and impose the restriction formula_10 by using the inverse sine function.

For a definite integral, one must figure out how the bounds of integration change. For example, as formula_11 goes from formula_12 to formula_13 then formula_14 goes from formula_12 to formula_16 so formula_17 goes from formula_12 to formula_19 Then,

formula_20

Some care is needed when picking the bounds. Because integration above requires that formula_10 , formula_17 can only go from formula_12 to formula_19 Neglecting this restriction, one might have picked formula_17 to go from formula_26 to formula_27 which would have resulted in the negative of the actual value.

Alternatively, fully evaluate the indefinite integrals before applying the boundary conditions. In that case, the antiderivative gives

formula_28 as before.

====Example 2====
The integral

formula_29

may be evaluated by letting formula_30 where formula_6 so that formula_32 and formula_33 by the range of arcsine, so that formula_34 and formula_35

Then,
formula_36

For a definite integral, the bounds change once the substitution is performed and are determined using the equation formula_37 with values in the range formula_38 Alternatively, apply the boundary terms directly to the formula for the antiderivative.

For example, the definite integral

formula_39

may be evaluated by substituting formula_40 with the bounds determined using formula_41

Because formula_42 and formula_43
formula_44

On the other hand, direct application of the boundary terms to the previously obtained formula for the antiderivative yields
formula_45
as before.

==Case II: Integrands containing &quot;a&quot;2 + &quot;x&quot;2==
Let formula_46 and use the identity formula_47

===Examples of Case II===

====Example 1====
In the integral

formula_48

we may write

formula_49

so that the integral becomes

formula_50

provided formula_51

For a definite integral, the bounds change once the substitution is performed and are determined using the equation formula_52 with values in the range formula_53 Alternatively, apply the boundary terms directly to the formula for the antiderivative.

For example, the definite integral

formula_54

may be evaluated by substituting formula_55 with the bounds determined using formula_56

Since formula_57 and formula_58
formula_59

Meanwhile, direct application of the boundary terms to the formula for the antiderivative yields
formula_60
same as before.

====Example 2====
The integral

formula_61

may be evaluated by letting formula_62

where formula_6 so that formula_64 and formula_65 by the range of arctangent, so that formula_66 and formula_67

Then,
formula_68
The integral of secant cubed may be evaluated using integration by parts. As a result,
formula_69

==Case III: Integrands containing &quot;x&quot;2 − &quot;a&quot;2==
Let formula_70 and use the identity formula_71

===Examples of Case III===
Integrals such as

formula_72

can also be evaluated by partial fractions rather than trigonometric substitutions. However, the integral

formula_73

cannot. In this case, an appropriate substitution is:
formula_74

where formula_6 so that formula_64 and formula_77 by assuming formula_78 so that formula_79 and formula_80

Then,
formula_81

One may evaluate the integral of the secant function by multiplying the numerator and denominator by formula_82 and the integral of secant cubed by parts. As a result,
formula_83

When formula_84 which happens when formula_85 given the range of arcsecant, formula_86 meaning formula_87 instead in that case.

==Substitutions that eliminate trigonometric functions==
Substitution can be used to remove trigonometric functions.

For instance,

formula_88

The last substitution is known as the Weierstrass substitution, which makes use of tangent half-angle formulas.

For example,

formula_89

==Hyperbolic substitution==
Substitutions of hyperbolic functions can also be used to simplify integrals.

For example, to integrate formula_90, introduce the substitution formula_91 (and hence formula_92), then use the identity formula_93 to find:

formula_94

If desired, this result may be further transformed using other identities, such as using the relation formula_95:
formula_96

<text>The Worshipful Company of Framework Knitters is one of the livery companies of the City of London. It was incorporated by letters patent issued by Oliver Cromwell in 1657, with a royal charter from Charles II in 1663. It was granted livery status in 1713. For a period it had its own hall in Red Cross Street, however for various reasons it was sold.

The Framework Knitters&#x27; Company ranks sixty-fourth in the order of precedence for livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Speed, Strength and Truth United&quot;.

It maintains almshouses known as the Cottage Homes in Oadby, Leicestershire – and has an active bursary awards scheme for up-and-coming students in fashion and textiles.

Quarterly dinners are held, normally at Mansion House or livery halls within the square mile of the City of London. These are well attended with guests including the Lord Mayor of London and the sheriffs.

<text>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, (CSMVS) formerly named the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India, is a museum in Mumbai (Bombay) which documents the history of India from prehistoric to modern times.

It was founded during British rule of India in the early years of the 20th century by prominent citizens of the city then called Bombay, with the help of the government, to commemorate the visit of the Prince of Wales (later George V, king of the United Kingdom and emperor of India). It is located in the heart of South Mumbai near the Gateway of India. The museum was renamed in 1998 after Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Kingdom.

The building is built in the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture, incorporating elements of other styles of architecture like the Mughal, Maratha and Jain. The museum building is surrounded by a garden of palm trees and formal flower beds.

The museum houses approximately 50,000 exhibits of ancient Indian history as well as objects from foreign lands, categorised primarily into three sections: Art, Archaeology and Natural History. The museum houses Indus Valley Civilization artefacts, and other relics from ancient India from the time of the Guptas, Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakuta.

==History==

In 1904, some leading citizens of Bombay decided to provide a museum to commemorate the visit of the Prince of Wales, the future King George V. On 14 August 1905, the committee passed a resolution saying:

&quot;The museum building embodies the pomp and height at which the British raj was moving ahead with their ambitious plans, in building the great metropolis Bombay&quot;. &quot;In keeping pace with the best style of local architecture, many buildings were built, among which, Bombay High Court building, and later, Gateway of India buildings were the most notable ones&quot;.
The foundation stone was laid by the Prince of Wales on 11 November 1905 and the museum was formally named &quot;Prince of Wales Museum of Western India&quot;. On 1 March 1907, the government of the Bombay Presidency granted the museum committee a piece of land called the &quot;Crescent Site&quot;, where the museum now stands. Following an open design competition, in 1909 the architect George Wittet was commissioned to design the Museum building. Wittet had already worked on the design of the General Post Office and in 1911 would design one of Mumbai&#x27;s most famous landmarks, the Gateway of India.

The museum was funded by the Royal Visit (1905) Memorial Funds. Additionally, the Government and the Municipality granted Rs. 300,000 and Rs. 250,000 respectively. Sir Currimbhoy Ibrahim (first Baronet) donated another Rs. 300,000 and Sir Cowasji Jehangir gave Rs. 50,000. The Museum was established under Bombay Act No. III of 1909. The museum is now maintained by annual grants from the Government and the Bombay Municipal Corporation. The latter pays for these grants from the interest accruing on the funds at the disposal of the Trust of the Museum.

The museum building was completed in 1915, but was used as a Children&#x27;s Welfare Centre and a Military Hospital during the First World War, before being handed over to the committee in 1920. The Prince of Wales Museum was inaugurated on 10 January 1922, by Lady Lloyd, the wife of George Lloyd, Governor of Bombay.

The museum building is a Grade I Heritage Building of the city and was awarded first prize (&quot;Urban Heritage Award&quot;) by the Bombay Chapter of the Indian Heritage Society for heritage building maintenance in 1990. In 1998 the Museum was renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya after the warrior king and founder of the Maratha Kingdom, Shivaji. The museum was renamed after the renaming of the city in 1995, when the colonial name &quot;Bombay&quot; was replaced by the native &quot;Mumbai&quot;.

==Architecture==
The museum building is situated in area, having a built-up area of 12,142.23m sq. It is surrounded by a garden of palm trees and formal flower beds.

The museum building, built of locally quarried grey Kurla basalt and buff coloured trachyte Malad stone. It is a three-storied rectangular structure, capped by a dome set upon a base, which adds an additional storey in the centre of the building. Built in the Western Indian and Indo-Saracenic style of architecture, the building accommodates a central entrance porch, above which rises a dome, tilled and modified well &quot;tiled in white and blue flecks, supported on a lotus - petal base&quot;. A cluster of pinnacles, topped with miniature domes surround the central dome. The building incorporates features like Islamic dome with a finial along with protruding balconies and inlaid floors, inspired by Mughal palace architecture. The architect, George Wittet, modelled the dome on that of Golconda Fort and the inner vaulting arches on those at the Gol Gumbaz in Bijapur. The interior of the museum combines the columns, railings and balcony of an 18th-century &quot;Wada&quot; (a Maratha mansion) with Jain style interior columns, which form the main body of the central pavilion below the Maratha balcony.

In its recent modernisation programme (2008), the museum created space for installation of five new galleries, a conservation studio, a visiting exhibition gallery and a seminar room, in the East Wing of the museum. The museum also houses a library. 
==Collections==
The museum collection comprises approximately 50,000 artefacts. The collection of the museum is categorised primarily into three sections: art, archaeology and natural history.
The museum also houses a forestry section, which has specimens of timbers grown in the Bombay Presidency (British India), and one exhibiting a small local geological collection of rocks, minerals and fossils. The Maritime Heritage Gallery, which displays objects relating to navigation, is the &quot;first of its kind in India&quot;. In 2008, the museum installed two new galleries, displaying the &quot;Karl and Meherbai Khandalavala collection&quot; and &quot;the Coins of India&quot;.

===Art section===
The art section displays the collections of Sir Purushottam Mavji, acquired in 1915, and the art collections of Sir Ratan Tata and Sir Dorab Tata, donated in 1921 and 1933 respectively.

The museum&#x27;s miniature collection encompasses representations of the main schools of Indian painting namely, Mughal, Rajasthani, Pahari and Deccani. It features palm leaf manuscripts dating to the 11th-12th centuries to the early 19th century pahari paintings, as well as paintings from the Sultanate period. Notable manuscripts housed in the museum include the Anwar-Suhayli painted in Mughal emperor Akbar’s studio and a 17th-century manuscript of the Hindu epic Ramayana from Mewar.

The ivory section has artefacts dating as early as the Gupta era. The museum also has decorative artefacts such as textiles, ivories, Mughal jades, silver, gold and artistic metal ware. It also has a collection of European paintings, Chinese and Japanese porcelain, ivory and jade artefacts. The museum also has sections dedicated to arms and armour and another to Nepali and Tibetan art. 
The arms and armour section contains a finely decorated armour of Akbar dating to 1581 CE, consisting of a steel breastplate and a shield, the former inscribed with religious verses.

===Archaeological section===
Sculptures and coins transferred from the Poona Museum in Pune and the collections of the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society resulted in the development of an archaeological section, with precious sculptures and epigrams. The Indus Valley Culture Gallery houses fishing hooks, weapons, ornaments and weights and measures from the Indus Valley civilization (2600–1900 BCE). Artefacts from the excavation of the Buddhist stupa of Mirpurkhas, were housed in the Museum in 1919. The sculpture collection holds Gupta (280 to 550 CE) terracotta figures from Mirpurkhas in Sind of the early 5th century, artefacts dating to the Chalukyan era (6th-12th century, Badami Chalukyas and Western Chalukyas), and sculptures of the Rashtrakuta period (753 – 982 CE) from Elephanta, near Mumbai.

===Natural history section===
The Bombay Natural History Society aided the Museum Trust in creating the natural history section. The museum&#x27;s natural history section makes use of habitat group cases and dioramas, along with diagrams and charts, to illustrate Indian wildlife, including flamingoes, great hornbills, Indian bison, and tigers.

===New galleries===
An exhibition entitled &quot;Pravaha&quot; highlighting early phase of Sir J. J. School of Art and the Progressive Art Movement was launched on 24 July 2017. The exhibition covered a range of paintings from the 1880s to 1950s through works of Pestonji Bomanji, Rustom Siodia, Sawlaram Haldankar, António Xavier Trindade, S. N. Gorakshakar, Govind Mahadev Solegaonkar, G. H. Nagarkar, J. M. Ahivasi, Raghunath Dhondopant Dhopeshwarkar, Raghuveer Govind Chimulkar, Rasiklal Parikh and Y. K. Shukla, Abalal Rahiman, Keshav Bhavanrao Chudekar, Lakshman Narayan Taskar, Syed Haider Raza, and K. H. Ara.

A prints gallery was launched with an exhibition entitled &quot;Bombay to Mumbai - Door of the East with its face to the West&quot; on 29 January 2015. The gallery was inaugurated by Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum in London, who also gave an illustrated lecture on &#x27;World Cultures&#x27; at the central foyer of the museum.

As part of the renovation project initiated in October 2008, the Krishna Gallery holding artworks related to the Hindu god Krishna, a Hindu deity of the preserver-god Vishnu, was opened in March 2009.

A textile gallery, the first gallery in the city, was opened in April 2010. It illustrates &quot;various techniques of textile manufacturing, regional collections and traditional Indian costumes&quot;.

Matrika Design Collaborative is currently designing the museum&#x27;s Indian miniature painting gallery. The content developed for the gallery will be converted into Braille text and tactile labels for the blind with help from designers, fabricators and consultants from the Helen Keller Institute.

A new gallery on traditional Indian jewellery will be opening in 2020. At the gallery, there will be an exhibit on Golconda diamonds - replicas of which have been presented to the museum.

The early examples are from Pauni and Pitalkhora. Mumbai itself has a rich tradition exemplified by the colossal Parel Relief of Shiva (represented here by a cast) and a Matrika from Baijanath Temple at Sewri near Parel belonging to the same phase as Elephanta. Other noteworthy images from Maharashtra are a Vishnu and a Ganesha of the eleventh century CE. Some well known sculptures are:
* Brahma, from Elephanta Caves

<doc id="375039" wikidata="Q731271" url="?curid=375039" title="Massachusetts Turnpike">
<text>The Massachusetts Turnpike (colloquially the &quot;Mass Pike&quot; or &quot;the Pike&quot;) is a controlled-access toll road in the U.S. state of Massachusetts that is maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). It runs concurrently with the entirety of Interstate 90 (I-90) within the state, and is the longest Interstate Highway in Massachusetts, spanning along an east–west axis.
The turnpike opened in 1957, and it was designated as part of the Interstate Highway System in 1959. It begins at the New York state line in West Stockbridge, linking with the Berkshire Connector portion of the New York State Thruway. The original western terminus of the turnpike was located at Route 102 in West Stockbridge before I-90 had been completed in New York state. The turnpike intersects with several Interstate Highways as it traverses the state, including I-91 in West Springfield; I-291 in Chicopee; I-84 in Sturbridge; the junction of I-290 and I-395 in Auburn; and I-495 in Hopkinton. The eastern terminus of the turnpike was originally at Route 128 (now cosigned with I-95) in Weston, it has been extended several times: to Allston in 1964, to the Central Artery (at the time designated as I-95/Route 3; currently designated as I-93/US 1/Route 3) in Downtown Boston in 1965, and to Route 1A in East Boston as a route to Logan International Airport in 2003 as part of the &quot;Big Dig&quot; megaproject. There are two auxiliary Interstate Highways in Massachusetts for I-90, those being I-190 and I-290.

The turnpike was maintained by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA) until the department was replaced by the Highway Division of MassDOT in 2009. The implementation and removal of tolls in some stretches of the turnpike have been controversial; travel between most, but not all, exits requires payment. The Fast Lane electronic toll collection system was introduced alongside cash payment in 1998; it was later folded into the E-ZPass branding in 2012. The original toll booths were demolished and replaced by toll gantries with the transition to open road tolling in 2016, which replaced cash payment with &quot;pay-by-plate&quot; billing.

==Route description==
The Massachusetts Turnpike is informally divided into two sections by MassDOT: the original &quot;Western Turnpike&quot; extending from the New York state border through the interchange with I-95 and Route 128 at exit 123 in Weston, and the &quot;Boston Extension&quot; that continues beyond exit 123 through Boston. It is a four-lane highway from the New York state border through its interchange with I-84 at exit 78 in Sturbridge; it expands to six lanes beyond this interchange and briefly travels with eight lanes from exit 127 in Newton through exit 133 by the Prudential Center in Boston. The underwater section of the Ted Williams Tunnel, which carries the turnpike under Boston Harbor to its eastern terminus at Route 1A by Logan International Airport, is reduced to four lanes. The turnpike is the longest Interstate Highway in Massachusetts, while I-90 in full (which begins nationally in Seattle, Washington) is the longest Interstate Highway in the United States.

===Western Turnpike===

In the west, the turnpike begins in Berkshire County at the Massachusetts state line in West Stockbridge, where I-90 (routed through the Berkshire Connector portion of the New York State Thruway) enters from Canaan, New York. Most toll plazas were located on the entrance/exit ramps before entering the turnpike itself. An exception was the mainline West Stockbridge toll plaza, designed for toll collection from inbound traffic from New York; it existed shortly after exit 3, an eastbound-only entrance and westbound-only exit in Massachusetts. The turnpike crosses the Williams River later in West Stockbridge and passes over the Housatonic River in Lee. The gap between exit 10 to US 20 in Lee and exit 41 to US 202 and Route 10 in Westfield (the first in Hampden County) is the longest gap between exits on the entire length of I-90, and the fifth-longest gap between exits in the entire Interstate Highway System. The highest elevation on the turnpike exists in the Berkshires, reaching above sea level in Becket; this point is also the highest elevation on I-90 east of South Dakota. Beyond the peak elevation and between the exits, an eastbound runaway truck ramp exists in Russell.

After almost of relative ruralness, I-90 has an interchange that leads to the separate routes of I-91 and US 5 at exit 45 in West Springfield; it passes over the Connecticut River before reaching Route 33 at exit 49 and I-291 at exit 51, both in Chicopee. The turnpike passes through Ludlow at exit 54 before crossing the Quaboag River to exit 63 in Palmer. The turnpike first enters Worcester County in Sturbridge, where exit 78 serves as the eastern terminus of I-84. In Auburn, exit 90 has a two-Interstate interchange with I-395 traveling southbound and I-290 traveling eastbound. The Blackstone River flows underneath the turnpike in Millbury, where it has an interchange with Route 146 and a second direct connection to US 20 at exit 94. Entering Middlesex County in Hopkinton, it has an interchange with I-495 at exit 106. The turnpike crosses the Sudbury River between exit 111 at Route 9 and exit 117 at Route 30, all located within Framingham. The last connection with another Interstate Highway on the Western Turnpike is located in Weston, at the I-95 and Route 128 concurrency. This multipiece interchange is collectively referred to as the &quot;Weston tolls&quot;. Before being renumbered exit 123 in both directions, exit 14 was an eastbound exit and westbound entrance, and exit 15 was a westbound exit and eastbound entrance; prior to demolition, a mainline toll plaza existed for through traffic. Following the removal of the toll plazas, exit 15 was reconfigured into exit 15A (now exit 123A) for I-95 and Route 128, and exit 15B (now exit 123B) toward Route 30. At this junction, the turnpike crosses over the Charles River.

===Boston Extension===
The first exit of the Boston Extension, exit 125, is an eastbound entrance and westbound exit at Route 16 in Newton. The turnpike enters Suffolk County in Boston before reaching the &quot;Allston–Brighton tolls&quot;, depositing traffic toward the Boston neighborhoods of Allston and Brighton and the nearby city of Cambridge. This exit is also used to access Soldiers Field Road, a surface parkway that provides local access through central Boston and parallels the Turnpike. Before being renumbered exit 131 in both directions, exit 18 was a left-hand eastbound exit and westbound entrance, and exit 20 was a westbound exit and eastbound entrance; a mainline toll plaza was previously placed in between them for through traffic and was classified as &quot;exit 19&quot;. Past the tolls, the turnpike reduces to six lanes, heads through the campus of Boston University and passes Fenway Park before crossing over the Muddy River as it approaches the city&#x27;s central neighborhoods.

Exit 133 and the now-closed Clarendon Street onramp are located within the Prudential Tunnel, which takes the turnpike underneath the Prudential Center; the former is an eastbound exit towards the Prudential Center and Copley Square, while the latter is a westbound-only entrance from Clarendon Street. Beyond the Prudential Tunnel, exit 134 is labeled as a singular exit traveling westbound, but splits into three ramps for eastbound travel; exit 134A is a left-hand exit toward South Station, while exits 134B and 134C are directed toward I-93 northbound and southbound, respectively. The turnpike travels under the Fort Point Channel before reaching South Boston at exit 135, after which it enters the Ted Williams Tunnel to pass beneath Boston Harbor. Exit 137 to Logan International Airport is the sole exit within the Ted Williams Tunnel, before the turnpike exits the tunnel and meets its eastern terminus at Route 1A northbound toward Revere.

===Service plazas===

==Tolls==
, toll revenue generated from the Massachusetts Turnpike is to be spent in the section in which it was collected, either the Western Turnpike or the Boston Extension (alternatively named the &quot;Metropolitan Highway System&quot; for administrative purposes).

At the recommendation of former secretary of administration and finance Eric Kriss, who recommended that tolls be eliminated along the entire turnpike except for the tunnels leading to Logan International Airport, the MTA voted to remove all tolls west of Route 128 in Weston in October 2006. Members of the Massachusetts Legislature Transportation Committee cited the potential need to amend state law and the uncertainty of how the turnpike would be maintained as setbacks to the toll removal, which ultimately never came to fruition.

In the November 9, 2006, edition of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Governor Mitt Romney announced his intention to try to remove the tolls before his successor, Deval Patrick, was inaugurated in January 2007, but this did not occur. In 2008, Patrick announced a similar plan to remove most tolls west of I-95, but this also did not occur before his term ended in January 2015. State law requires tolls to be removed west of Route 128 when its debt is paid and the road is in &quot;good condition&quot;, but MassDOT plans to continue tolls after the bonds are paid off in January 2017, because the road will still need $135 million per year for repairs and maintenance.

At a January 22, 2009, board meeting, the turnpike decided to stop charging a one-time $25.95 fee for the acquisition of a Fast Lane toll transponder, replacing it with a 50-cent monthly recurring service fee. The implementation of the 50-cent monthly fee was canceled after long delays at toll plazas on Easter Sunday.

===Tolls===

The turnpike traditionally utilized the ticket system for toll collection; a driver would obtain a ticket from an onramp, which they would surrender to an offramp and pay a toll based on traveled distance. While most toll plazas were located on the entrance/exit ramps by the turnpike, exceptions included the mainline toll plazas in West Stockbridge, Weston, and Allston–Brighton. Motorists were previously charged $27.50 (equivalent to $ in ) for Fast Lane transponders, although this fee has since been removed.

When all-electronic tolling went live on the Mass Pike in 2017, the Tobin Bridge, Callahan Tunnel, Sumner Tunnel, and Ted Williams Tunnel joined the system and were converted to charging a single toll in both directions, rather than a double toll in one direction. The Tobin Bridge was converted to all-electronic tolling for southbound only in July 2014.

In addition to license plate information, the gantries also collect vehicle speed data; a MassDOT spokesperson said that the agency &quot;will not be using the AET [all-electronic tolling] system to issue speeding violations&quot;. Toll data is not a public record and is not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, and MassDOT states that &quot;All data collected will remain secure and kept confidential.&quot; The data can be obtained by subpoena, however, and law enforcement will be able to specify license-plate numbers that will generate an immediate email if detected by the system.

==History==
=== Background and construction ===
In the period following World War II, Boston had fallen into a deep period of stagnant growth. Its former maritime industries had closed as traffic in the harbor declined, the textile mills that had provided a large portion of the city&#x27;s wealth had migrated out of the region seeking new locations that would allow them to maximize revenues, and property development had ground to a halt with virtually no new construction of any impact occurring since the beginning of the Great Depression. Boston retail stalwarts such as Filene&#x27;s and Jordan Marsh had decided to focus their energies and growth into the suburbs; Boston&#x27;s citizens had begun to flee to the same suburban pastures as property taxes in the city skyrocketed. As &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; stated, Boston was &quot;dying on the vine&quot;.

After the end of the war, Massachusetts entered into a period of new highway projects planning that sought to help end the economic malaise the state was suffering from. It was in 1947 that Republican Governor Robert F. Bradford realized that the commonwealth needed to implement a standard framework to properly guide the planning and construction of these new roadways. He commissioned a study to produce a new Highway Master Plan for the eastern region, and, by 1948, it had been completed. Seeking the political benefits that a major public works project would bring, Bradford sent his plan to the Democratic-controlled Massachusetts General Court for approval; however, the Democrats sat on the project until their candidate, newly elected Democratic Governor Paul A. Dever, took office in January 1949.

It was instead Dever who initiated the program to implement the Highway Master Plan for the city shortly after taking office in 1949. Enjoying a Democratic majority within the State House coupled with a Democratic governor for the first time in the commonwealth&#x27;s history, he pushed through a series of highway bills with associated gas tax increases totaling over $400 million (equivalent to $ in ) between 1949 and 1952. To oversee this undertaking, Dever brought in the former commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works, William F. Callahan, to once again head the agency he had helmed from 1934 to 1939. Known for his strong personality and drive to get projects completed, Callahan immediately set out to construct three of the proposed highways (not including what would become I-495, which had been included in the 1947 plan): the &quot;original outer&quot; circumferential highway which became Route 128, the Southeast Expressway, and the Central Artery through the heart of the Boston&#x27;s downtown. These three projects, totaling more than $92 million (equivalent to $ in ), were seen as being essential to the growth of the city in the future. However, the construction of these roads took such a large portion of funds that the commonwealth was unable to provide funds for the Western Expressway project. However, before Callahan could oversee the completion of the southern leg of Route 128, he was appointed by Dever to run the newly formed MTA.

Because of the financial strain created by the bond issues used to construct these other highways, the commonwealth was unable to afford the costs of floating more bonds to fund the expenditures required to construct the Western Expressway along the Western Approach corridor of Boston. Callahan suggested creating a strong, independent, and semipublic transportation authority that could fund the new expressway by floating its own bond issues and financing them through tolls along the highway while having its own powers of eminent domain to secure the land needed to build it. Utilizing the political goodwill he accrued during his tenure as public works commissioner, primarily through extensive patronage hires, Callahan was able to push his idea for the new authority through the State House with ease. The authority was formed in early 1952, and, by 1955, it had issued the required bonds needed to construct a highway from the New York–Massachusetts border to the recently completed Route 128 in Weston. Despite being completed in 1957, many within the commonwealth quickly realized that the local routes used to get into Boston were still insufficient for the automotive traffic burdens placed upon them.

=== Extensions and improvements ===
The road was designated as part of the Interstate Highway System as I-90 in 1959. In 1964, exit numbers were introduced.

In 1965, exit 10 was rebuilt to connect to I-290 and I-365.
While the highway construction boom proved to be fortunate for the suburban communities these new roadways passed through, the economy of Boston was still in a fragile state. Realizing that Boston still needed to be connected to the turnpike to help reverse its flagging economy and reputation as a municipal has-been, Callahan was tasked in 1955 by the legislature to create an extension into the city designed to facilitate a turnaround of the city&#x27;s fortunes. This new highway would connect the Massachusetts Turnpike to the heart of the city with a extension of the Interstate. It was his plan to bring the tolled turnpike from its terminus at Route 128 in West Newton into the city along the path of the Boston and Albany Railroad and connect it to the Southeast Expressway. This plan was in line with the 1948 Master Highway Plan for the city, which had always called for a Western Expressway to be built into the city. However, with the passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, the federal government provided sufficient funds to the states to construct new highways with a 90-percent subsidy, rendering the need for a toll road into the city obsolete. Complicating the matter, Callahan&#x27;s planned extension route was not universally accepted by others within the state, such as newly elected Governor John A. Volpe and Newton Mayor Donald Gibbs, who sought to construct a freeway that would follow a different route between the Borders of Newton, Waltham, and Watertown along the Charles River and US 20 and be constructed using the funds now being provided by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Additionally, residents of the city of Newton, who would see significant demolition of neighborhoods within the city along with large portions of its central business district to make way for the turnpike extension, were adamantly against the proposed Boston and Albany routing of the road. Newton, through the terms of two mayors, set about fighting the turnpike proposal through a series of increasingly futile legislative maneuvers in the General Court. Realizing that the needs and wants of the smaller city could not overcome the influence of Callahan within the state capitol, the smaller city would instead redirect its efforts to blocking the highway at the federal level through the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and federal courts. Affected property owners within Boston who were also looking at the possibility of losing their homes and business followed Newton&#x27;s lead by filing a series of state and federal lawsuits that they hoped would derail the proposed extension. In the late 1950s, eminent domain takings for the Massachusetts Turnpike Extension into Boston devastated the historic Black-American community named &quot;The Village&quot;. Compensation was offered for the homes below market value. Homeowners and renters confronted racial discrimination when trying to purchase or rent homes in Newton. Real estate agents would not work with them. They had to rely on word of mouth to find a new home. It is estimated that 50 percent left Newton as a result of the construction of the turnpike.

Exit 11A in Hopkinton opened in 1969. It was built to connect the turnpike with I-495 and enables transit between northern New England and Cape Cod.

The year 1968 saw the beginning of the first major improvement of the turnpike after the completion of the Boston extension in 1965. While the original design of the roadway called for an eight-lane expressway along the majority of the route, it was only constructed as a four-lane roadway along most of its length until it reached the junction of Route 9 in Framingham, where the roadway expanded to six lanes. Starting in 1968, the highway from the I-84 interchange in Sturbridge to Route 9 was widened from its original four lanes to six; that widening project was completed around 1971. However, the mainline right-of-way was constructed to allow future expansion of the roadway, with most bridges over the highway built with the eight-lane roadway in mind, so few bridges had to be rebuilt when it was widened in the late 1960s.

The original logo depicted Paul Revere on horseback with the words &quot;Massachusetts Turnpike Authority&quot; in a circle around him. One incarnation of the pilgrim hat shield had a Native-American arrow sticking through the pilgrim hat. It was replaced with a plain pilgrim hat and the words &quot;Mass Pike&quot; in 1989. It has been reported variously that the sign was changed due to confusion among motorists who sometimes mistakenly turned in the direction the arrow pointed (right) when attempting to enter the turnpike or that it was the result of a letter campaign describing the signs as offensive to Native Americans.

Electronic toll collection was introduced as an alternative to cash payment with Fast Lane transponders in 1998; when installed in the inner windshield of a vehicle, the equipment would be recognized automatically in special lanes at toll plazas and would withdraw the toll amount from the motorist&#x27;s account.

Exit 94 (former exit 10A) in Millbury connects the turnpike to Route 146 and US 20 via the Route 20 Connector, which, in turn, facilitates movement between Worcester and Providence, Rhode Island; construction began in 1996 and was opened in 1998 before being completed in 1999.
When designing the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T Project; Big Dig) in the 1970s and 1980s, the horror stories regarding urban renewal projects such as the construction of the old viaduct in the 1950s weighed heavy on the minds of Frederick P. Salvucci and his team. It was realized early on that the commonwealth could not just lay waste to parts of the city and pave them over; the state would have to ensure that construction would balance the needs of the highways against the livability of the city and neighborhoods the project would pass through. Mitigation efforts would be of utmost importance in moving ahead with the project. Governor Francis Sargent had shut down any ideas of further freeway construction within the Route 128 beltway in 1970, thereby canceling both the I-695 &quot;inner belt&quot; and the Southwest Corridor freeway projects, placing more emphasis on the already-completed Boston extension of I-90, the extension of I-93 into Boston, and the work to eventually depress Boston&#x27;s Central Artery below ground level as the only unbuilt freeway-related construction projects &quot;inside&quot; of Route 128 that would be allowed to go forward. The notions of using existing rights of way or areas where neighborhood displacement would be minimized were applied to the second extension of the turnpike as part of the Big Dig. Salvucci deliberately planned to bring the East Boston Extension through areas with little or no occupancy or those properties already owned by the commonwealth. As a result, East Boston saw almost no takings of buildings or homes through eminent domain or the destruction of neighborhoods because construction was relegated to the then-unoccupied areas of the Seaport District and Logan International Airport. Like the first turnpike extension, the connection of the turnpike to East Boston was also designed to provide an economic stimulus to the city, this one to revitalize the desolate Seaport District. The MTA managed the Big Dig, which rerouted the elevated Central Artery into the O&#x27;Neill Tunnel through Downtown Boston, and extended the turnpike beyond its terminus at the Central Artery into the Ted Williams Tunnel and connected it to Route 1A beyond Logan International Airport. Construction began in 1991, and the final extension of the turnpike was opened in February 2003. It was for the financial needs of the project that the &quot;Metropolitan Highway System&quot; was created with the turnpike east of Route 128; the Ted Williams, Sumner, and Callahan tunnels under Boston Harbor; and I-93 from Southampton Street through the O&#x27;Neill Tunnel and the Zakim Bridge to the foot of the Tobin Bridge. Finances for the Western Turnpike and the Boston Extension continue to be handled separately with this reorganization.

Fast Lane was first sponsored by BankBoston, and later FleetBoston Financial, before sponsorship was assumed by Citizens Bank in October 2003.

By 2004, much of the road had been improved with renovated pavement, renovated bridges, and a jersey barrier in the median.

In response to a fatality caused by the collapse of the ceiling of the eastbound I-90 connector tunnel approaching the Ted Williams Tunnel on July 10, 2006, and, in response to MTA Chair Matthew J. Amorello&#x27;s refusal (at the time) to resign, Romney took legal steps to have Amorello forcibly removed as head of the MTA. This effort culminated in Amorello&#x27;s resignation on August 15, 2006. The next day, John Cogliano was sworn in as the new chair of the MTA by Romney. On November 27, 2006, departing Attorney-General Thomas Reilly (Democrat) announced the state would launch a civil suit over the collapse of the ceiling in the Ted Williams Tunnel. The commonwealth sought to recover over $150 million (equivalent to $ in ) from project manager Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff, builder Modern Continental, and the manufacturer of the epoxy used to hold the ceiling bolts.

Compensating for the sparsity of eastbound entrances and westbound exits in Back Bay and Downtown Boston, a westbound U-turn ramp heading eastbound was opened in Allston in 2007; while unsigned with an exit number, it was recognized as exit 20A for administrative purposes.

Under legislation signed into law by Governor Deval Patrick on June 26, 2009, the turnpike was folded into a new superagency that controls all surface transportation in the state. The new agency, MassDOT, operates all highways formerly under MassHighway and the MTA as well as eight urban roadways formerly owned and maintained by the state Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). In addition, MassDOT oversees the RMV, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), regional transit authorities, and the state aeronautics commission. The new transportation department began operations on November 1, 2009.

Citing federal highway regulations that prohibit sponsorship of toll plaza signage, the contract with Citizens Bank was not renewed upon expiration; the Fast Lane name was replaced with the E-ZPass branding, with which Fast Lane was interoperable, in 2012.

Tolls from exit 1 in West Stockbridge to exit 6 in Chicopee were removed by then-Governor Bill Weld in 1996, following complaints that the tolls collected in Western Massachusetts were financing the Big Dig in Boston; they were ultimately reinstated in October 2013.
In 2014, Raytheon won a $130 million (equivalent to $ in ) contract to convert the Massachusetts Turnpike to all-electronic open road tolling. The stated goal of the change was to &quot;make vehicle travel safer and more efficient&quot;. Additional changes included the elimination of toll booth operators, as well as the demolition of existing toll plazas and reconfiguration of surrounding roadways. Overhead gantries between most exits read E-ZPass transponders. Drivers without a transponder use pay-by-plate, having their license plate photographed and an invoice sent to the registered owner. This method of payment adds a $0.60 surcharge per invoice, with payment made online, or in cash at a local retail location. Installation of gantries began in January 2016, and open road tolling began on October 28, 2016. The inner segments of the toll booths were demolished 30 days after this date, which allowed traffic speeds to be raised. Complete demolition of toll booths and reconstruction was completed by the end of 2017. As there are no gantries between exits 45 and 54 (former exits 4 and 7) or between exits 90 and 96 (former exits 10 and 11), the Massachusetts Turnpike is essentially free between those pairs of exits. Otherwise, the transition to open road tolling is revenue neutral, meaning the tolls between any other pair of exits only saw small adjustments. Tolls are slightly higher for out-of-state residents without an E-ZPassMA transponder, and no-transponder tolls are higher.

Exit 22A was permanently closed in 2019 in an effort to improve safety, as its narrow deceleration lanes frequently caused accidents and congestion.

The 2009 edition of the &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; required that all US states submit plans to transition to milepost-based exit numbering by 2012. All exits on the turnpike were expected to be renumbered following this convention with two sign replacement projects scheduled for completion by 2018; the contractors were ultimately instructed to install the new signs with the existing numbers, albeit with wider exit tabs that would accommodate larger two- and three-digit exit numbers should the conversion take place in the future. In November 2019, MassDOT announced that statewide milepost-based exit renumbering would begin in Western Massachusetts in summer 2020. The work began along I-90 during the week of December 13, 2020, starting from Weston (I-95) and working westward before renumbering the exits inside I-95 and toward the airport. The work was completed in one month.

Much of the air space (&quot;air rights&quot;) over the Boston Extension has been leased to third parties for commercial development. This concept was originally designed to &quot;knit together communities&quot; that were divided by the new highway, since the turnpike had been described as &quot;wider and more divisive to the city&quot; than the original Central Artery. More recently, the income received from the leased air rights have been used for paying off the Big Dig. There are 23 parcels of air space over the highway, the majority of which have not been developed. Among other objectives, guidelines established by the &quot;Civic Vision for Turnpike Air Rights in Boston&quot; in 2000 recommend that the proposed use of the parcels &quot;[foster] increased use and capacity of public transportation&quot; and &quot;[reinforce] the vitality and quality of life in adjacent neighborhoods&quot;. The Star Market (briefly renamed Shaw&#x27;s Supermarket) in Newtonville is the earliest example of commercial construction over the turnpike. In the 1960s, the MTA intended to route the highway through the parking lot of the supermarket&#x27;s previous location in the city; this alignment was ultimately approved by the SJC, under the condition that a replacement Star Market was allowed to be built above the turnpike. Other projects developed through air rights include the Four Points by Sheraton in Newton, the Copley Place shopping mall in Boston, and the Prudential Center in Boston. Proposals for future air rights projects include the mixed-use Fenway Center, and an extension of the Boston University campus near Boston University Bridge. After four decades of no new developments, in August 2020, construction began on Parcel 12, and construction was expected to begin within the month at Fenway Center pending a final agreement with MassDOT, leading to planned closure of one lane in each direction until August 2021. Parcel 12 is between Newbury Street, Boylston Street, and the west side of Massachusetts Avenue and is expected to feature a 13-story citizenM hotel, a 20-story office tower (including the headquarters of CarGurus), a reconstructed bus shelter, a public park, street-level retail, and a new entrance to the Hynes Convention Center station of the Green Line subway. The developer of Parcel 13, on the east side of Massachusetts Avenue along Boylston Street, submitted updated plans in February 2020, with 17 stories of condos, hotel, parking, and public space. An approved plan for Parcel 15 (known as 1000 Boylston Street) was canceled by the developer in August, 2019, with the dissolution resulting in a lawsuit.

==Future==
===Proposed exits===
For decades, there has been discussion about a potential new interchange with Route 56 in Oxford. This new interchange would be located between exit 78 (old exit 9) in Sturbridge and exit 90 (old exit 10) in Auburn. Former Leicester selectman Thomas V. Brennan Jr. created the idea for this potential new exit in 1996, and he continued to advocate for the idea into the late 2000s. In 2011, the Town of Oxford included the construction of a new interchange as a long-term recommendation in their municipal transportation plan; construction estimates were $60 million to $75 million (equivalent to $ to $ in ).

The construction of an exit between exit 10 (former exit 2) in Lee and exit 41 (former exit 3) in Westfield, separated by a gap, has been controversial since the 1960s. The state conducted a study to determine the feasibility of such a project in 2018; land occupied by a service plaza and a maintenance facility (both in Blandford) and Algerie Road in Otis have been suggested as locations for a potential exit.

===Allston interchange===
The &quot;I-90 Allston Multimodal Project&quot; is a plan to replace a deteriorating viaduct in Allston by redeveloping the turnpike through the land of the former CSX Transportation&#x27;s Beacon Park Yard, which is now owned by Harvard University, along with improvements to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority&#x27;s Framingham/Worcester Line. The preliminary design plan called for the turnpike to be realigned at-grade and off the existing viaduct, and for the adjacent Soldiers Field Road to be partially realigned onto a new viaduct above the turnpike and off of the existing at-grade roadbed. The design is of a considerably smaller footprint than the existing configuration; this would facilitate the construction of the proposed West Station and the expansion of Harvard University on land where the existing viaduct is located. The design phase was expected to be completed in 2019 and with a planned ground breaking in 2020.

In September 2021, after much public criticism of the viaduct and river impact during construction, a new final design was announced, which keeps the turnpike and Soldiers Field Road at-grade. In the narrowest portion of the project, known as the &quot;throat&quot;, the Charles River Bike Path will be put on a boardwalk over the river, and roadway shoulders will be narrowed by a collective four feet for a short length to avoid any permanent filling of the river. This significantly delayed the project, and, , preliminary design is in progress, and modified project permits need to be obtained; construction was expected to start in 2023 and last for 6–10 years. As of October 2023, the project is undergoing the federal environmental permitting process, which will continue into 2024. The project did not win a National Infrastructure Project Assistance Program (MEGA) competitive grant on its 2021 application for $1.2 billion in federal funding, nor the $200 million applied for from the same program in 2023.

===I-495 interchange===
The &quot;I-495/I-90 Interchange Improvements Project&quot; is intended to realign exit 106 (former exit 11A) in Hopkinton, where the existing interchange (designed for the now-demolished toll plazas) is notoriously congested and accident-prone during rush hour and holiday travel times. , MassDOT is examining three design proposals, which have raised the suggestions of separate northbound/southbound I-495 exits and the extension of acceleration lanes through exit 111 (former exit 12) in Framingham. The project initially was estimated to cost between $296–413 million, and the design phase expected to be 25-percent complete by 2020. In July 2019, MassDOT announced that the state would be moving ahead with preferred design for overhaul of I-495/Mass Pike interchange consisting of a series of &quot;flyover ramps&quot; that would eliminate the interweaving of traffic that causes bottlenecks and crashes at the interchange. The state expects that the construction would begin in 2022 and run through 2026 at an estimated cost of approximately $296.4 million.

==Government oversight==
Since 2001, the MTA had come under fire from state politicians in a fight for control of the quasistate agency. Beginning in 2001, former Massachusetts acting Governor Jane Swift (Republican) attempted to fire Christy Mihos, a former turnpike board member and Jordan Levy, the vice chair of the board.

Mihos and Levy had cast votes on the board to postpone a toll hike. Swift objected, saying such a delay was &quot;fiscally irresponsible&quot; and saying the two men &quot;interfered with the effective daily management of the Authority&quot;. Mihos and Levy refused to step down and sued Swift to retain their positions. The SJC ruled that the turnpike was &quot;not part of the machinery of the government&quot; and therefore not subject to Swift&#x27;s decisions.

Governor Mitt Romney, elected in 2002 during a fiscal crisis, ran on a political platform of streamlining state government and eliminating waste. Part of this was the elimination of the MTA. Romney wanted to fold the turnpike into the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway), the state highway department, operated under the Executive Office of Transportation. A first step to this was to replace the chair of the board, Matthew J. Amorello, with someone loyal to the governor. The governor has the power to appoint members to the board, but the SJC advised in an advisory opinion that &quot;nothing in G. L. c. 81A explicitly provides for the removal and reassignment of the chairperson to the position of &#x27;member.

Romney put pressure on Amorello to step down. Amorello announced he would do so in 2007, after Romney would have left office. Romney continued to press the legislature to give him the power to remove members from the board, specifically the chairman, pointing to a series of financial and construction mishaps over the last several years. However, the legislature instead sought to keep Amorello on board by extending the terms of various board members to prevent Romney from removing Amorello.

Under a plan to save state funds, the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) announced plans to close eleven of its branches in leased locations and move the operations into facilities owned by MassHighway and the MTA located in toll plazas, visitor centers, and offices. RMV branch closings were planned for Framingham, Lowell, North Attleborough, Cambridgeside Galleria Mall in Cambridge, New Bedford, Eastfield Mall in Springfield, Southbridge, Falmouth, Eastham, Beverly, and Boston. Also, a portion of the newly increased sales tax in the state averted a planned toll increase. The MTA will receive approximately $100 million from the state general fund over the next few years, alleviating the need for the toll hike.

The MTA also owned the Callahan and Sumner tunnels, the other two road connections between Downtown Boston and East Boston under Boston Harbor. Upon completion of the Big Dig, including the O&#x27;Neill Tunnel segment of I-93, were transferred to its control. The authority received no state or federal government funding. Its revenues came from tolls, leases on air rights and service areas, and advertising. Its assets were all transferred to the new MassDOT agency as part of the restructuring of agencies.

<text>The Vauxhall Cavalier is a large family car that was sold primarily in the United Kingdom by Vauxhall from 1975 to 1995. It was based on a succession of Opel designs throughout its production life, during which it was built in three incarnations. The first generation of Cavalier, launched in 1975 and produced until 1981, was Vauxhall&#x27;s version of the General Motors &#x27;U-Car&#x27; — essentially an Opel Ascona B/ Opel Manta with a few minor visual differences.

The second generation of Cavalier, launched in 1981 and produced until 1988, was launched simultaneously with the identical new generation of Opel Ascona, which was sold across the world in various guises on the GM &quot;J-Body platform&quot;. The third and final generation of Cavalier, launched in 1988 and produced until 1995, was based on the first generation of Opel Vectra with the same production span. Cavaliers for the UK market were predominantly built at Vauxhall&#x27;s Luton plant, but were also built alongside their Ascona/Vectra sister models at Opel plants in Continental Europe.


== Mark I (1975–1981)==


Launched with a 1,896 cc engine as a 1976 model in November 1975, the Cavalier was a restyled version of the Opel Ascona B which had debuted three months earlier in West Germany. The Ascona/Cavalier was built on what GM called the U-car platform — which was essentially a stretched version of the T-body used in the smaller Kadett C/Chevette. The Cavalier was originally intended to have its own bodywork and interior design. However, GM management stopped its development six months away from the car&#x27;s intended release and decreed that it used the Opel Ascona body and interior almost unaltered, but with the longer hood and &quot;droopsnoot&quot; nose from the Manta B, albeit without the air slots between the headlamps, whilst the rear fascia would be altered with the license plate moved below the bumper and an applique panel between the rear lamps with &quot;VAUXHALL&quot; spelled out in large letters similar to existing models. In the end to keep costs down, the different nose, designed by Wayne Cherry, was the only obvious styling feature to set the Vauxhall apart., with the interior also having no differences from the Opel sister car except for badging and trim. The new models bore a strong visual resemblance to the 1973 OSV (Opel Safety Vehicle) project which had been seen in West Germany two years before.

Van, pick-up and estate versions were also on the drawing board, but the MK1 Cavalier was ultimately never produced in these bodystyles, though prototypes were constructed to the extent that a road legal Cavalier Van can be seen in an early episode of UK TV show &quot;Minder&quot;, the exact same car used in the production being pictured at. In the meantime, estate versions of the smaller Chevette and Astra, as well as the larger Carlton, would be launched to compensate for the lack of a Cavalier estate.
To begin with, the Mark I Cavalier was produced principally alongside the Ascona at the newly refurbished Opel plant in Antwerp, Belgium.

Shortly after its launch, the Cavalier was tested by &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine and received a much higher rating than the Ford Cortina Mk III and Morris Marina against which it was tested. However, the Cortina was less than a year away from replacement, and January 1976 saw the arrival of the Chrysler Alpine (the British version of the Simca 1307, which had recently been voted European Car of the Year). In Britain, demand for the Cavalier initially outstripped supply, one of the factors in General Motors making a decision soon afterwards to add the Cavalier to its British as well as continental production lines in August 1977.

The first Vauxhall Cavalier to be assembled at Vauxhall&#x27;s Luton plant was driven off the production line by Eric Fountain, Vauxhall&#x27;s manufacturing director, on 26 August 1977, after which the 1256 cc version, assembled at Luton and using engine and transmission already familiar to Viva 1300 owners, broadened the range. At that stage the 1584 cc Cavalier and the 1979 cc which had joined it were still being imported from Belgium, but in due course these, too, started to emerge from the Luton production plant. The commencement of Cavalier production in the UK also helped ensure that supply for the car met demand, and consequently its sales figures increased so it was now a constant presence in the top 10 best selling cars in Britain.

The timing of the Cavalier&#x27;s United Kingdom launch was well-judged. The United Kingdom tax system meant that sales to company car fleets comprised a larger proportion of the overall market – especially for middle-weight saloons — than elsewhere in Europe: the Ford Cortina Mk II had been replaced by the Ford Cortina Mk III in 1970, but in the eyes of the all-important company car fleet managers the newer Cortina never quite matched the earlier car for reliability, notably in respect of problems with its cable clutch and with camshaft wear in the 1.6 and 2.0 litre ohc units. The traditionally very conservative fleet market was therefore particularly receptive to Vauxhall&#x27;s new Cortina challenger. At the time, British Leyland was facing criticism for the lacklustre design and doubts about build quality and reliability surrounding its cars, especially the Morris Marina and the smaller Austin Allegro. The Cavalier was launched around the same time as Chrysler&#x27;s Alpine, which featured a more modern front-wheel drive hatchback layout and was voted European Car of the Year for 1976, but it would ultimately fail to meet sales expectations on the British market and was not reputedly a reliable or well-built car.

The original Cavaliers were available as two and four-door saloons, and with a two-door booted (three-box) coupé body as used for the Opel Manta. The cars came with a choice of 1.6 and 1.9 L inline-four cylinder Opel CIH engines in the saloon: only the 1.9 L engine was available in the coupé. Vauxhall engineers built Cavalier prototypes using the 2.3 L Vauxhall Slant-4 engine, for use in a future high-performance variant, but the proposals did not get past GM Europe management, and as a result the larger-engined Cavaliers were exclusively powered by the Opel CIH engine.

It was revised in 1978, as the 1.9 L became a 2.0 L engine and the 1.3 L OHV engine from the Vauxhall Viva and Vauxhall Chevette was used to create the entry-level Cavalier 1.3 variant. At the same time, a three-door hatchback known as the Sports hatch (also seen on the Manta) was added to the range.

There were plans for a five-door hatchback version to be launched, but this bodystyle was never produced on the first generation Cavalier, although at this time hatchbacks still only accounted for a small percentage of sales on larger family cars. That would change during the 1980s, however.
All Cavalier saloons shared most of their bodywork with the Opel Ascona but had the slanted nose of the Manta to give them the distinct &quot;droop snoot&quot; front end. The coupé also had a front air dam.

Despite being the same car mechanically, the Opel Ascona was sold alongside the Cavalier in the United Kingdom until 24 July 1981, when GM decided to phase out duplicated models with the Opel brand in the United Kingdom and merge remaining dealerships with those of Vauxhall. The Opel Manta (and Monza) remained available, giving the Opel brand a &quot;sports&quot; position in Britain until the Manta was finally discontinued in 1988.

That the Manta was sold alongside the MK2 Cavalier in the 1980s gave rise to the curiosity that the previous generation Ascona/Cavalier was effectively being sold concurrently with its successor, since a coupé/sports hatch version of the Ascona C/Cavalier Mark 2 was never engineered. However, the early to mid 1980s saw the decline of coupé models on the British market, with British Leyland not replacing the MG B when it closed the famous MG factory at Abingdon in 1980, and even the Ford Capri (a top-ten seller in Britain as late as 1980) had no immediate successor after the end of production in 1986, as Ford felt that there was not sufficient demand in Europe for a new sporting coupé to be launched. This was largely due to the rising popularity of &quot;hot hatchbacks&quot; and sports saloons including the Volkswagen Golf GTI.

Vauxhall, from 1978 until 1979, offered the Cavalier Coupé in a convertible format called the Centaur. Only 118 of these were made and fewer than 30 were believed to have survived by 2007. The cars were developed by Magraw Engineering and sold through Vauxhall dealerships on behalf of Crayford. The Centaur is basically a Cavalier GLS Coupé 2-litre with the hard roof replaced with a soft top leaving a T-bar for strength. The floor pan was also strengthened.

The Silver Aero, Wayne Cherry&#x27;s design concept, is often considered the ultimate Cavalier Mark I. This was a one-off prototype built in 1980, based on the Cavalier Sportshatch. The car was displayed at the International Car Show at the NEC in October 1980. The plan was to offer existing Sportshatch owners and buyers to upgrade their car to the Silver Aero spec. The car has a 2.4-litre turbocharged engine which produces . Orders were taken, but not enough to warrant production, and the car remained a one-off.

The original Cavalier was a relatively strong seller in Britain, even though it never quite matched the runaway sales success of the Ford Cortina, or even the sales figures attained by British Leyland&#x27;s Morris Marina (which sold well throughout the 1970s despite being widely condemned in the motoring press) but it at least managed to help Vauxhall regain lost ground in a market sector where it had declined during the first half of the 1970s as Victor sales slumped. It also helped repair Vauxhall&#x27;s image, which had been hit hard in the early 1970s by build quality and reliability issues surrounding cars like the Victor. Nearly 250,000 were sold, though by December 2009 just 373 remained.

The Vauxhall Cavalier MK1 was also sold with left-hand drive in some European countries, including Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Italy, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland, alongside its Opel equivalent. The coupé was available with the 1.3 engine and in Scandinavia the car came with Manta-style headlight wipers. Vauxhalls were at one time sold alongside Opels in Europe (mostly in countries where memories of the German occupation brought about resistance to German cars) but Vauxhall announced they were pulling out of the 11 other countries where they sold cars on 6 December 1979 and export sales stopped entirely in 1981, allowing General Motors to concentrate on the Opel brand in these markets.

In RHD markets such as Ireland, Cyprus and Malta, the Vauxhall brand was also dropped, with Opel becoming the main GM marque. Holden also looked at taking the U-Car but they declined as they found that the prototypes they had tested were not suitable for the roads in the outback without extensive modifications.

===Chevrolet Chevair===
The Chevrolet Chevair in South Africa was a variant of the Cavalier/Ascona, featuring the grille of the Opel Manta and a four-door body. The engine choices were different, consisting of a 2.0 and a 2.3 litre pushrod four. (These were both versions of Chevrolet&#x27;s 2.5-litre four). Outputs were respectively, with the bigger engine being considered much smoother running. A later (1978) version with the Ascona front was sold as the &quot;Chevrolet Ascona&quot;, with Vauxhall&#x27;s 1.3 litre engine from the Viva. The Chevair was first introduced in November 1976. The 2.0 was called De Luxe and the 2.3 received the GL moniker. Both models were available with a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic, with the better equipped GL being recognizable by having headrests, Rostyle wheels, and chrome trim bordering the wheel wells. During 1978 a more luxurious Berlina version arrived, available only with the automatic transmission. It received new &quot;mag-style&quot; wheels, tinted windows, velour upholstery, and a twin exhaust tip. By July 1978 the outputs were quoted in ISO ratings; this meant that the stated power dropped from for the 2.3, while the 2.0 was no longer listed.

In early 1980 an updated variant was introduced. The De Luxe was dropped. The 1980 model can be recognized by a new grille with somewhat larger openings, new wheels, and new wraparound bumpers in black plastic. Chevrolet badges were removed from the car, as GM South Africa were phasing out the Chevrolet name in the country. The Chevair was replaced by the front-wheel drive Opel Ascona in South Africa in 1983.

GM South Africa also rallied the Chevair in the South African championships. A Group 1 car with a tuned 2.5-litre version of the Chevrolet engine, as well as a Group 2 car with a Lotusesque DOHC 16-valve Vauxhall 2.3-litre engine were campaigned. They developed respectively. A Chevair driven by Tony Pond won the 1979 Duckhams Rally. Despite a further victory in 1979 they could not threaten the Ford Escorts nor the Datsuns in the overall championship.

== Mark II (1981–1988)==
After a four-year gestation period, the new front-wheel drive Cavalier was introduced on 26 August 1981. Unlike the previous generation, the Cavalier II had no styling or engineering difference from its Opel sister the Ascona C, differing only in badging and trim. On its launch, it offered class-leading levels of fuel economy and performance which had previously been unseen in this size of car. Sales began the following month. The GM Family II engine - used on all by the base 1.3L model, was manufactured by Holden&#x27;s Fishermans Bend, Australia factory.

This model was part of GM&#x27;s family of compact J-cars, along with the new Opel Ascona, the Australian Holden Camira, the Brazilian Chevrolet Monza, the Japanese Isuzu Aska, and the North American Chevrolet Cavalier, Pontiac Sunbird, Buick Skyhawk, Oldsmobile Firenza (which made use of a Vauxhall nameplate from the 1970s), and Cadillac Cimarron. In the United Kingdom, the new Cavalier was a huge success and challenged the supremacy of the Ford Cortina as the company car of choice. Indeed, it went on sale only a year before the Cortina was discontinued.

By 1982, Ford and Vauxhall had an effective two-horse race at the top of this sector on the British market, as sales of the Talbot Alpine (previously a Chrysler until Peugeot took over the European operations of Chrysler) had tailed off by 1981, while British Leyland was winding down production of the Austin Ambassador hatchback and Morris Ital saloon and estate in preparation for the launch of any all-new car (which would be sold as the Austin Montego) by 1984. Popular foreign competitors at the time included the Renault 18, which had arrived on the British market in December 1978. The MK2 Cavalier also debuted in the same year as the MK2 Volkswagen Passat.

Following the British public&#x27;s reluctance to embrace the Ford Sierra&#x27;s radical styling in 1982, the Cavalier overtook the Sierra in sales and outsold the Sierra in 1984 and again in 1985, although the Sierra had comfortably outsold it in 1983. The Sierra narrowly outsold it in 1986, and a facelift for the Sierra at the start of 1987 helped Ford build a wide lead at the top of the large family car sector as nearly 140,000 Sierras were sold that year, while Cavalier sales fell below 100,000.

By the time the second generation Cavalier was discontinued to make way for the third generation model in October 1988, the Sierra was almost twice as popular.

It was Britain&#x27;s second best selling car (behind the Ford Escort) in 1984 and 1985, and at its peak, this version of the Cavalier came with the choice of 1.3 or 1.6 L engines derived from the smaller Vauxhall Astra (also sold as the Opel Kadett), while for 1983 a 1.8 L engine was launched, which had electronic fuel injection. A diesel of 1.6 L was added about the same time, while the 1.8 L was supplemented by a 2.0 L for the 1987 model year.

Perhaps surprisingly, it was narrowly beaten to the European Car of the Year award for 1982 by the Renault 9, with third place going to the Mark II Volkswagen Polo.

This model was produced as a two-door or four-door saloon and five-door hatchback. An estate version followed in October 1983, based on the Holden Camira estate with rear body panels imported from Australia. It was originally only available with the 1.6 S engine in Base, L, and GL models, and proved a slow seller. For 1985 the diesel was also made available, but the Estate still only represented about 7 percent of Cavalier sales in 1985 and 1986. The slow selling two-door saloon was dropped from the Cavalier range by October 1982 and the Birmingham Motor Show, although it remained part of the Ascona range in other markets. A convertible, based on the two-door and converted by Hammond &amp; Thiede in Germany, was subsequently offered.



The Thatcher government in the United Kingdom created a tax break at 1.8 L, with any company car having a larger engine than this attracting higher personal benefit taxes, thus effectively giving the Cavalier an advantage over its rivals soon after its launch.

On its launch, the MK2 Cavalier was well received by the motoring press, and like its predecessor was the catalyst for another surge in Vauxhall sales. In 1981, just over 33,000 MK1 and MK2 Cavaliers had been sold in the UK, although it was still Britain&#x27;s seventh best selling car. A year later, sales more than trebled to over 100,000 cars as Britain&#x27;s fifth best selling car. In 1983, it attained more than 127,000 sales (some 7% of the new car market) and was the fourth best selling car, although it still trailed behind the new Ford Sierra. For 1984 and 1985, however, it was Britain&#x27;s second best selling car, with more than 130,000 sales each year, comfortably outselling the fifth-place Sierra. In 1986, it was narrowly outsold by the Sierra, which then underwent a major facelift and became available as a saloon for the first time, and gained a wide sales lead over the Cavalier for the next two years.

===First Facelift — Mk2b (1985–1987)===

Mirroring changes being made to the Opel Ascona C, an updated Cavalier debuted in late 1984 (for the 1985 model year) which saw all models gain the &quot;eggcrate&quot; grille from the CD model, modified rear lamp clusters with darkened detailing, new steering wheels, larger steering column stalk switches, upgraded equipment, new upholstery options and different instrument graphics — some of these changes came direct from the recently introduced Kadett E/Astra Mark 2. Engine options were further expanded, with the fuel injected 1.8L engine now being available on GL trim.

===Second Facelift — Mk2c (1987–1988)===

Late 1986 saw the range updated for the second time before its eventual replacement by the Vectra A/Mk3 model in 1988, with new body-colour front grilles and rear lamp clusters revised again in a style similar to the larger Senator model together with further improvements to equipment levels. A new 2.0L version of the Family II engine became available on CD, SRi and GLS trim, whilst the availability of the fuel injected 1.8L unit was extended down to L trim.

The SRi model was now available with the uprated 20SEH engine, which had and could exceed . This had the same engine as the Astra GTE 8v (20SEH), though it was more powerful owing to a better exhaust route.

The last version of the Cavalier Mark II to be launched was the Cavalier Calibre. Based on the SRi130 with styling from Aston Martin/Tickford and the bodykit, sports suspension and exhaust being produced by Irmscher, it was a limited production run of only 500 cars. The car came with a very high specification including a trip computer, Recaro seats, power windows and power steering. It cost around £13,000 when released in 1987.

Vauxhall sold 807,624 examples of the second generation Cavalier between 1981 and 1988. By December 1989, it was the third most common model of car on British roads, although these government statistics mostly calculated each car by its generation rather than by different nameplate, with pre and post facelifted versions of an unchanged basic design (for example the Ford Sierra) being counted separately.

In August 2006, &quot;Auto Express&quot; named it as the country&#x27;s sixth most scrapped car of the last 30 years, with just 6,343 (fewer than 1%) still on the road. The only car to cease production after the Cavalier Mark II, and which disappeared at a greater rate, was the Skoda Estelle (which was withdrawn from sale in 1990). By December 2009, that figure had fallen to a mere 1,289.

== Mark III (1988–1995)==


By the mid-1980s, General Motors had started developing a new model to replace the J-Car models in Europe (its American, Australian and Japanese divisions would instead be replaced by different designs in due course) by the end of the decade. Opel, in developing the Ascona C/Cavalier II replacement had already begun a policy of retiring its legacy model names (a process that had started with the Rekord being replaced with the Omega two years earlier), hence the new car would carry the &#x27;Vectra&#x27; nameplate. Vauxhall however with its strong brand loyalty in the UK, elected to keep the Cavalier name. Soon afterwards, development also began on a new coupé which would share the same underpinnings as the hatchbacks and saloons, but would use a different nameplate and feature completely different styling.

The final generation Cavalier went on sale on 14 October 1988, being Vauxhall&#x27;s version of the Opel Vectra &quot;A&quot;, again available as a saloon and hatchback. There was no estate version in the Opel line-up, and as this design was not going to be sold in Australia, there was no prospect of Vauxhall turning to Holden for a replacement. Early plans for an estate model exclusive to Europe to be developed never materialised. During 1989, however, the Cavalier&#x27;s floorpan did spawn a new coupé — the Calibra, the first Vauxhall coupé since the original Cavalier Coupé was discontinued in 1981. The Calibra was the official replacement for the Opel Manta, which had been discontinued in 1988, and was also sold on continental Europe under the Opel Brand. Plans for the Calibra to be imported to the USA under the Saab brand never materialised.

The Vectra name was not adopted at this model change as Vauxhall feared reviving memories of the much-maligned Vauxhall Victor, whereas the Cavalier was a generally well received product and had helped boost Vauxhall&#x27;s sales and reputation. Early Victors had been viewed in some quarters as excessively corrosion prone, but the Victor was becoming a very distant memory by this stage: the Vectra name would eventually appear on a Vauxhall in 1995, when the Cavalier was finally replaced.

For the first time in fifteen years, Vauxhall began exporting cars in LHD to other European countries, with Cavaliers badged as Opel Vectras, which was a boost to GM&#x27;s confidence in its once-troubled British division.

In place of the Mark II Cavalier&#x27;s angular exterior was a more rounded appearance, reflecting the change in styling tastes throughout Europe at this time. There was also a new economical 1.4 L petrol engine. The biggest changes to the range were the addition of 2.0-litre, sixteen-valve engines, better known as the &quot;red top&quot; or XE. This was fitted to the GSi 2000 and later SRis. Also made available was a four-wheel drive system, fitted to a 2.0i model (8 valve SRi spec) and on a version of the GSi 2000.

There were two diesels available: a 1.7 L, from launch, and an 1.7-litre Isuzu-engined lightly blown turbodiesel from 1992. The early SRis were fitted with the 2.0-litre eight-valve engine from the previous Cavalier model, which produced without a catalytic converter.

Despite the lack of an estate body style, the Cavalier topped the large medium family car sales charts in Britain in 1990, narrowly outselling the Ford Sierra, while Rover was beginning to phase out its Montego in favour of the new Rover 400 Series and later the more upmarket 600 Series. Other strong contenders in this sector included the long-running Citroën BX and Peugeot&#x27;s highly regarded 405.

Having first outsold the Sierra in Britain in 1990, it was Britain&#x27;s second best selling car behind the Ford Escort in 1992. It did not lose top spot in its sector until it was overtaken by the Sierra&#x27;s successor, the Mondeo, in 1994.

The Calibra, launched in 1989, was well received, notably for its sporty although cramped interior (largely based on the interior of the Cavalier) and its streamlined styling which in turn enabled the Calibra to have the lowest drag coefficient of the period at 0.26 for the 8v model (0.29 for the rest) — a record it held for the next 10 years.

A few variants were made: the 2.0 litre eight valve, 2.0 L sixteen valve (the same engine found in the proven Cavalier GSi 2000), the turbo version (again, the same engine used in the very successful Cavalier Turbo), the 2.5 L V6 (with a top speed of around 145 mph) and finally the 2.0 L 16-valve &quot;Ecotec&quot;.

A facelift in the autumn of 1992 for the 1993 model year saw the Cavalier&#x27;s 1.4 L engine dropped and the 2.5 L V6 added to the range. At this time the GSi 2000 was replaced by a new four wheel drive version badged simply &quot;Cavalier Turbo&quot;, with a turbocharged version of the sixteen valve engine producing over . The Vauxhall logo was added to the centre of the boot. Most of the range now had airbags and anti-lock brakes as standard (the first car in its class to do so) and all models were fitted with a toughened safety cage, side-impact beams (providing additional longitudinal load paths) and front-seatbelt pretensioners. This version of the Cavalier was the first Vauxhall to feature a drivers airbag, with a passenger one being optional; this feature soon became available across the rest of the company&#x27;s range.

The exterior design was also freshened up, with a new look grille, headlights, rear lights and bumper mouldings and an increase in sound insulation, especially in GLS and higher models making the Cavalier a quiet place to travel in. In late 1994, the new 2.0L Ecotec engine was launched replacing both the popular eight-valve C20NE and high-performance, sixteen-valve &quot;redtop&quot; engine. The new engine had improved fuel economy and low-end torque at the cost of maximum power output, compared to for the &quot;redtop&quot; that it replaced.

After twenty years and three generations, the Cavalier came to an end in October 1995 when it was replaced by the Vectra, though sales continued for about a year afterwards and several P registered versions (August 1996 to July 1997 period) were sold.

The third and final incarnation of the Cavalier was a big improvement over its predecessors (and most earlier Vauxhalls) in terms of durability, with the rust problems that had plagued Vauxhall for years finally being conquered. This was reflected by the fact that Mark III Cavaliers were a common sight on British roads for well over a decade after the end of production.

The demise of the Cavalier name marked a significant moment for the Luton-based company, as it would be the last of its main models with a distinct name from its Opel counterparts until the rebadging of the Opel Speedster as the Vauxhall VX220 and the Opel Karl as the Vauxhall Viva. All future Vauxhall models would share their names with those of Opel, or in the case of the 2004 Vauxhall Monaro, with Holden. However, the Astra nameplate was chosen by Vauxhall at the beginning of 1980 for its version of the first front-wheel drive Opel Kadett, and from 1991 General Motors decided to sell the Opel version of the car as the Astra.

This version of the Cavalier shared its chassis with the Saab 900 that was produced from 1993 until 1998, and continued until 2002 as the Saab 9-3, due to Saab also being within the General Motors combine at the time.

==Popularity==
A total of more than 1,800,000 Cavaliers were sold in three generations, and a 20-year production run, making it the fifth most popular car ever sold in Britain.

Following its launch in October 1975, the original Cavalier took time to gain ground on the British market, with just under 30,000 sales placing it as the 13th best selling car for 1976. It climbed to eighth place the following year with more than 41,000 sales, peaking at seventh place in 1978 with over 55,000 sales. It was still the seventh best seller in 1980, though sales for that year had dipped back to just over 41,000 as the economy entered recession.

Well over 200,000 were sold in total over a six-year production run, but by the end of 2009 just 373 remained, and it had been a rare sight on British roads even by the mid 1990s. The Mark II Cavalier was a much bigger success. In 1982, its first full year on sale, just over 100,000 were sold in Britain. This placed it as Britain&#x27;s fourth best selling car, putting it just 35,000 sales short of its key rival, the Ford Cortina, which was replaced that autumn by the all-new Sierra. 1983 saw Cavalier sales in Britain exceed 127,000 as it retained fourth place, but it was outsold by the Sierra which occupied second place with almost 160,000 sales.

The next two years, however, saw the Cavalier top the large family car sector in Britain in terms of sales, and overall it was the nation&#x27;s second best selling car behind the Ford Escort, breaking the 130,000 barrier on both occasions while the Sierra only just made it into six figures. Despite falling popularity towards the end of production which saw the Ford Sierra comfortably outsell it, a total of 807,624 Mark II Cavaliers were sold in Britain during its seven-year production run. The Mark II Cavalier remained a popular second hand buy and common sight on British roads for a decade or so afterwards, and proved to be more resistant to rust than its predecessor as well as earlier Vauxhalls.

The Mark III Cavalier enjoyed similar popularity to its predecessor. Launched in October 1988, Cavalier sales for 1989 stood at 130,000 (including some Mark II&#x27;s) as it was Britain&#x27;s fourth best selling car overall, while the Ford Sierra stood second with more than 175,000 sales, but in 1990, it edged ahead of the Sierra into third place, and by 1992, it was Britain&#x27;s second best selling car with nearly 110,000 sales (the lower figures being the result of the recession at the time) while sales of the ageing Sierra had slumped to less than 80,000.

The Sierra&#x27;s successor, the Mondeo, overtook it in 1994 but even in the Cavalier&#x27;s last year in production, 1995, it still managed nearly 74,000 sales, despite being replaced by the Vectra in October 1995.

Airey Neave, Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and advisor to Margaret Thatcher, was assassinated in a Mk.I Cavalier on 30 March 1979 by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) when a car bomb was detonated beneath it while driving away from the Palace of Westminster. A red Mark III Cavalier was also used in the 1998 Omagh bombing carried out by the Real IRA.

By February 2016, just over 4,500 Cavaliers across all three generations were still in use on Britain&#x27;s roads, with most remaining examples being MK3 models. More than 1.8 million had been sold there.

==Motorsport==

The Cavalier was used in the British Touring Car Championship from 1990 to 1995. The Cavalier was competitive, with Vauxhall Motorsport winning the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship in 1992, but the strength of the competition, and bad luck, conspired to deny John Cleland the Drivers&#x27; title in both the 1991 and 1992 seasons, finishing 2nd in 1991 and 3rd in 1992 – the latter a result of a dramatic final-race showdown, culminating in a collision between Cleland and rival Steve Soper.

1993 and 1994 both saw Cleland finish 4th in the championship; however the Cavalier finally won the Drivers&#x27; title in 1995, with John Cleland winning the Drivers&#x27; Championship, and Vauxhall Sport the Manufacturers&#x27; title.

The Cavalier was replaced by the Vectra in 1996, although privateers such as Richard Kaye and Jamie Wall would continue to use them until the end of the 1997 season.

<text>In the first Gulf of Sidra incident, 19 August 1981, two Libyan Su-22 Fitters fired upon two U.S. F-14 Tomcats and were subsequently shot down off the Libyan coast. Libya had claimed that the entire Gulf was their territory, at 32° 30′ N, with an exclusive fishing zone, which Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi asserted as &quot;The Line of Death&quot; in 1973. Two further incidents occurred in the area in 1986 and in 1989.

==Background==
In 1973, Libya claimed the Gulf of Sidra as a closed bay and part of its territorial waters. This prompted the United States to conduct Freedom of Navigation (FON) operations in the area since the claim did not meet the criteria established by international law. Libya often confronted U.S. forces in and near the gulf, and on two occasions its fighter jets opened fire on U.S. reconnaissance flights off the Libyan coast; once in early 1973 and again in late 1980. FON operations intensified when Ronald Reagan became president.

In August 1981, Reagan authorized a large naval force led by a pair of U.S. Navy aircraft carriers, and , to deploy to the disputed area. The two carriers had embarked a total of four interceptor squadrons: VF-74 &quot;Be-Devilers&quot; and VMFA-115 &quot;Silver Eagles&quot;, flying F-4 Phantoms from &quot;Forrestal&quot;, and the VF-41 &quot;Black Aces&quot; and VF-84 &quot;Jolly Rogers&quot;, flying F-14 Tomcats from &quot;Nimitz&quot;. The Libyan Air Force responded by deploying a high number of interceptors and fighter-bombers.

Early in the morning of 18 August, when the U.S. exercise began, at least three MiG-25 &quot;Foxbats&quot; approached the U.S. carrier groups and were escorted away by American interceptors. The Libyans tried to establish the exact location of the U.S. naval force. Thirty-five pairs of MiG-23 &quot;Floggers&quot;, MiG-25s, Sukhoi Su-20 &quot;Fitter-Cs&quot;, Su-22M &quot;Fitter-Js&quot; and Mirage F1s flew into the area, and were soon intercepted by seven pairs of F-14s and F-4s. U.S. Naval Intelligence later assessed that a MiG-25 may have fired a missile from away at U.S. fighter aircraft that day.

==Incident==
On the morning of 19 August, after having diverted a number of Libyan &quot;mock&quot; attacks on the battle group the previous day, two F-14s from VF-41 &quot;Black Aces&quot;, &quot;Fast Eagle 102&quot; (CDR Henry &#x27;Hank&#x27; Kleemann/LT David &#x27;DJ&#x27; Venlet) (flying BuNo &quot;160403&quot;) and &quot;Fast Eagle 107&quot; (LT Lawrence &#x27;Music&#x27; Muczynski/LTJG James &#x27;Luca&#x27; Anderson) (in BuNo &quot;160390&quot;), were flying a combat air patrol (CAP), ostensibly to cover aircraft engaged in a missile exercise. However, U.S. Navy Commander Thompson S. Sanders wrote in &quot;Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian&quot; that his S-3A Viking&#x27;s mission was the real precursor to this incident. Sanders was ordered to fly his Viking in a &quot;racetrack&quot; orbit (oval pattern) inside Gaddafi&#x27;s claimed zone but outside the internationally recognized territorial water limit to try to provoke the Libyans to react. An E-2C Hawkeye alerted Sanders that two Sukhoi Su-22 fighters had taken off from Ghurdabiyah Air Base near the city of Sirte. 

The Hawkeye directed the F-14s to intercept. Sanders dove to an altitude of and flew north to evade the Libyan aircraft, an experience Sanders found stressful because the S-3A was not equipped with a threat warning receiver, nor with any countermeasures, a deficiency later remedied on the S-3B.
The two F-14s set up for an intercept as the contacts headed north towards them. Only a few seconds before the crossing, at an estimated distance of 300 m, one of the Libyans fired an AA-2 &quot;Atoll&quot; at one of the F-14s, but missed. 

The two Su-22s split as they flew past the Americans, the leader turning to the northwest and the wingman turning southeast in the direction of the Libyan coast. The Tomcats evaded the missile and were cleared to return fire by their rules of engagement, which mandated self-defense on the initiation of hostile action. The Tomcats turned hard port and came behind the Libyan jets. The Americans fired AIM-9L Sidewinders; the first kill was credited to &quot;Fast Eagle 102&quot;, the second to &quot;Fast Eagle 107&quot;. Both Libyan pilots ejected.

Prior to the ejections, a U.S. electronic surveillance plane monitoring the event recorded the lead Libyan pilot reporting to his ground controller that he had fired a missile at one of the U.S. fighters and gave no indication that the missile shot was unintended. The official U.S. Navy report states that both Libyan pilots ejected and were safely recovered, but in the official audio recording of the incident taken from , one of the F-14 pilots states that he saw a Libyan pilot eject, but his parachute failed to open.

Less than an hour later, while the Libyans were conducting a search-and-rescue operation for their downed pilots, two MiG-25s entered the airspace over the Gulf. They headed towards the U.S. carriers at Mach 1.5 and conducted a mock attack in the direction of USS &quot;Nimitz&quot;. Two VF-41 Tomcats headed towards the Libyans, which then turned around. The Tomcats turned home, but had to turn around again when the Libyans headed towards the U.S. carriers once more. After being tracked by the F-14s&#x27; radars, the MiGs finally headed home. One more Libyan formation ventured out into the Gulf towards the U.S. forces later that day.

==Aftermath==

Fast Eagle 102 (BuNo &quot;160403&quot;) is now on display at the Commemorative Air Force Museum in Midland, Texas. The restored F-14 was unveiled in a ceremony in August 2016. Vice Admiral Dave Venlet cut the first tape. 

Fast Eagle 107 (BuNo &quot;160390&quot;) was destroyed in an accident on 25 October 1994. The plane crashed into the ocean after its pilot, Kara Hultgreen, was forced to eject, but did not survive. Parts of the plane were salvaged weeks later.

<text>The Ford Scorpio is an executive car that was produced by Ford Germany from 1985 to 1998. It was the replacement for the European Ford Granada line (although in the UK and Ireland the Scorpio was marketed under the Granada name until 1994). Like its predecessor, the Scorpio was targeted at the executive car market. A variant known as the Merkur Scorpio was sold briefly on the North American market during the late 1980s. While Ford&#x27;s Taurus was of a similar size, Ford maintained the need for two parallel cars – while Scorpio buyers valued high-speed stability, a tight turning radius, and a sizable rear seat, American buyers had other requirements.


==First generation (1985–1994)==

Codenamed &quot;DE-1&quot; during its development (since it was intended to straddle the European D and E segments), the Scorpio was heavily based on the Sierra, sitting on a stretched version of its floorpan, and using a similar styling philosophy set by both the Sierra and the third generation Escort.

Under the bonnet were well proven engines, starting with the venerable Pinto engine unit in 1.8 L and 2.0 L capacities, as well as the V6 Cologne engine in 2.4 or 2.8-litre displacements. The larger engine was later replaced by a 2.9-litre derivative, and while the slow selling 2.4 remained in production until 1994 it was effectively replaced by the 2.0 DOHC in most markets. By the summer of 1989, the Pinto engines had begun to be gradually replaced, with the eight-valve version of Ford&#x27;s DOHC engine replacing the 2.0 L model.

The Scorpio was intended to maintain Ford&#x27;s position in Europe as the principal alternative to a Mercedes or BMW for those looking to own an executive car. It was also launched more than a year ahead of new competitors from Rover and Opel/Vauxhall.

To this end Ford built on the already extensive specification available on the outgoing MkII Granada (which for the period, was very well equipped, with features such as leather seats, air conditioning, electric sunroof, and trip computer either standard or available as options) by adding some additional features unusual on a mass market car. Improvements available included: heated windscreen, cruise control, electrically adjustable seats front and rear and later all-wheel drive.

Initially the Chubb AVA lock barrel was fitted to models at launch, but by around 1987 these were replaced by the Tibbe lock.

The most notable advance was the fitment of anti-lock braking system, the first time this feature had been made standard across the whole range on a mass-produced car. The car was widely praised as being very comfortable and spacious, particularly in respect of its rear legroom.

Unlike the Granada, it was initially only available as a hatchback, and not as a saloon or estate. This proved to be a mistake for Ford, which later introduced a saloon version in December 1989. An estate version finally appeared in the beginning of 1992, when the whole range underwent a facelift, with new styling which hinted at the new Mondeo, which would replace the Sierra a year later. There were few engineering changes over the years, notably the introduction of the DOHC engines in 1989, and the Scorpio Cosworth with a 2.9 L 24 valve Cosworth V6 in December 1990.

The Cosworth was both large and fast, which consequently gave it poor fuel consumption. Many owners often commented at the fact that 25 miles per gallon was about as much as you could get out of a car with this engine. Prop-shaft deterioration over time was also considered to be a problem on early Mark I and II Cosworths.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, following the initial market resistance towards the Sierra, something which had been attributed to its radical styling, Ford elected to keep the Granada name in those markets, making the Scorpio effectively a Mk III Granada. The &quot;Scorpio&quot; name was instead used as a trim designation rather than the model name, being positioned higher than Ford&#x27;s traditional &quot;Ghia&quot; top of the range model. These models were marketed as &quot;Granada Scorpio&quot;, but were badged simply as &quot;Scorpio&quot;, with an elongated &quot;Granada&quot; underneath.

===Merkur Scorpio===
The Merkur Scorpio was a North American version of the European Scorpio Mk I. The car was offered at select Lincoln–Mercury dealerships from 1988 to 1989.
The Merkur Scorpio was only offered with the Cologne 2.9L V6 engine with some detail differences from the contemporary Fords. Adapted to meet American emissions requirements, the Merkur version of the Scorpio produced when introduced to the North American market in 1988.

The vast majority were fitted with the A4LD four speed automatic transmission, and the rest received the T-9 five speed manual transmission. Only automatic versions of the Scorpio were available in Canada. The car was marketed as an upscale, mid-size luxury car, but never achieved the market impact that the Ford Motor Company hoped for. Ford dropped the Merkur nameplate altogether after 1989.
===Facelifted model===
The model was a facelifted Mark I with changed grille, headlights, rear lights, bonnet and dashboard. It went on sale in March 1992, at the same time that an estate model (first shown in October 1991 at the London Motorfair) was added to the range.

The outdated Peugeot XD3 diesel engine was also replaced by a more powerful unit from Italian VM Motori. This facelift realigned the look of the Granada with the forthcoming Mondeo, and kept styling cues coherent across the model range.


==Second generation (1994–1998)==

Launched at the Paris Motor Show in October 1994, the second generation Scorpio was made available in saloon or estate styles only, the hatchback bodystyle having been dropped. It was essentially a comprehensive risk of its predecessor, retaining the same floorpan, as well as all of the same engines that were in use at the end of the first generation&#x27;s run. Many suspension and handling improvements were made between the first and second generations (including self levelling rear suspension on the estates). It was also radically restyled both inside and outside, with new design of headlights, grille and door handles, which were taken from the Ford Crown Victoria.

Despite its controversial styling, the luxury interior, handling and performance were widely praised by reviewers. Edward Stobart praised the car, and Jeremy Clarkson declared it &#x27;[as] equally talented&#x27; as the Vauxhall Omega, one of the Scorpio&#x27;s main rivals, and that it was &#x27;well made... extremely well equipped, and considering its size, it was good value for money&#x27;. In general however, this praise however was overshadowed by criticism concerning the styling. In addition, the &quot;Granada&quot; name, which had been retained in the United Kingdom and Ireland for the MkI Scorpio (AKA MkIII Granada) was finally dropped and the &quot;Scorpio&quot; name – already used elsewhere – was adopted.

In April 1998, it was listed as the third worst N-registered car (August 1995 to July 1996) to own in the United Kingdom from a &quot;Top Gear&quot; survey of 120 cars, receiving a particularly low rating for its reliability. It fared slightly better in the 1999 and 2000 surveys.

In September 1997, the Scorpio was facelifted, with darker headlight surrounds and a more subtle grille, to tone down the front end of the car. The &#x27;50s-throwback&#x27; &#x27;low-slung wrap-around&#x27; rear lights were also revised to make the &#x27;plump&#x27; rear-end of the car less bulbous. Despite plans to release a new model in 1998, this was to be the last development for the model, which finished production over the summer of 1998.

Whether or not the car genuinely made Ford&#x27;s sales expectations, the shifting European car market at the end of the 1990s meant that it was not directly replaced. This was not unusual at the time, with the market trending towards either high-specced large family cars for executives or towards multi-purpose vehicles for families, as mainstream brands gradually surrendered the &quot;E&quot; segment to &quot;premium&quot; brands such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi. Reflecting this new reality, Ford&#x27;s ownership of Jaguar and Volvo meant that it now had direct access to the European executive car market with the newly developed Jaguar S-Type and Volvo S80 without directly replacing the Scorpio.

The Dutch royal family used several Scorpios, some stretched ones, and all painted in Royal Blue. There is still a custom-built Scorpio landaulet in the royal stables. After Ford ended the production, the Volvo S80 replaced the Ford models.

=== Styling and appearance ===
The new Scorpio was the first ever Ford design developed entirely using a CAD/CAM computer system, and inside the car were new armchair style seats and improved interior quality, but outside the new &#x27;Americanised&#x27; look was controversial. The car sported bulbous &#x27;globular&#x27; headlights and its tail lights were arranged in a thin line just above the bumper (described as a &#x27;gratuitously narrow... ill-chosen necklace... resembling a giant cushion&#x27;). Unusually, Ford never released the name of the designer and maintain to this day that the car outsold its expected figures (although they never released what those figures actually were), however it has been noted that the unknown designer was &#x27;very proud&#x27; of their work.

The bulging headlights and wide grille were defended as &#x27;bold&#x27;, &#x27;quirky&#x27;, &#x27;a design statement&#x27;, &#x27;dramatic&#x27;, and provided &#x27;refreshing lines&#x27;, but the public and press reaction to the design was largely negative. Contemporary reviewers wrote that the car had a &#x27;stupid grin&#x27;, &#x27;gormless mouth&#x27;, &#x27;droopy nose&#x27;, &#x27;daft&#x27; &#x27;humped boot&#x27;, &#x27;dopey eyes&#x27;, &#x27;revolting&#x27; &#x27;stupid headlights&#x27;, a &#x27;fish-mouth grille opening&#x27;, &#x27;fat flanks&#x27;, a &#x27;reptilian gurn&#x27;, and that it looked &#x27;mixed up&#x27;, &#x27;boxy yet curvy&#x27;, &#x27;gargoyle-ugly&#x27; and &#x27;bug eyed&#x27;, it &#x27;resembled something that David Attenborough might reveal from a dank cave in Borneo&#x27;, and &#x27;driving a milk float would score more cred points in a traffic jam&#x27;.

The styling was so controversial that several months before the release of the vehicle to the public, Ford set up a focus group involving large sections of the automotive press at their engineering and design centre in Cologne, comparing the distinctive &#x27;smiling mouth&#x27; grille to historic designs such as those from Jaguar, Alfa Romeo, and Austin-Healey. The acknowledgement by Ford of good design from other manufacturers was praised by the press; however, the design of the Scorpio itself received universal condemnation, and the focus group failed to placate the media regarding the car&#x27;s appearance, who would later go on to viciously attack the styling on release. On release, the styling was immediately criticised in both the automotive press and the non-automotive mainstream media, with entire pages in the latter attacking the aesthetics. Tony Mason of Top Gear disliked the front, saying that the headlamps looked out of place and the car looked incomplete, Edward Stobart described the car as &#x27;the ugliest car in Britain&#x27;, particularly disliking the &#x27;featureless&#x27; rear, saying that it did not look as good as the BMW 7-Series, while Ken Greenley of the Royal College of Art (designer of the SsangYong Musso and Rodius) disliked the entire design philosophy. Described as &#x27;just plain ugly&#x27;, &#x27;like one of those fairground cars with a silly face on the front&#x27;, &#x27;like something out of Walt Disney, someone has gone on acid and tripped to the Seventies for the front&#x27;, and &#x27;designed by a committee of people in sunglasses sitting in the dark&#x27;. Other reviewers were even more scathing, one saying that &#x27;it doesn&#x27;t have much of a personality... the front of the car is like a face with a huge beaming smile... it looks a bit ridiculous really&#x27;, another describing the front end as &#x27; like someone&#x27;s just rammed a banana up its bottom&#x27;, and another remarking &#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t feel proud of this... it&#x27;s the ugliest car going&#x27;.

After release, the criticism became even more intense, journalists describing it as &#x27;much unloved&#x27;, &#x27;Britain&#x27;s most unpopular car&#x27;, a &#x27;poor relation&#x27; to its rivals, &#x27;styled like a guppy&#x27;, with &#x27;the looks of a smiling frog&#x27;, and &#x27;the ugliest manmade vehicle of all time&#x27;.

Described as a &#x27; hideous monstrosity&#x27;, Jeremy Clarkson wrote in &quot;The Times&quot; at the time that this car had &quot;village idiot features&quot; and a &quot;loopy face&quot;. He elaborated later on that the Scorpio ended any argument as to which car was the ugliest on the road, that the car &quot; an extra from &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;&quot;, and that it had &#x27;a face of such unparalleled awfulness&#x27; and would &#x27;make... children cry&#x27;. Richard Hammond and James May described it as &#x27;&#x27;, while May additionally described it as &#x27;not Ford&#x27;s finest styling&#x27;, and in Richard Porter&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Crap Cars&quot; the Scorpio Mark II was listed as number 49 (of 50) on looks alone.

On the DVD special &quot;Clarkson: Heaven and Hell&quot;, Jeremy Clarkson set up a jousting contest between a Scorpio – which he described as &quot;a wide mouthed frog&quot; – and a Triumph TR7, eventually destroying both cars via head-on collision.

In Germany, the satirical magazine &quot;Titanic&quot; noted the Scorpio&#x27;s front&#x27;s similarity to the facial features of politician Günter Verheugen, who would go on to become EU Commissioner.

===Trim levels and engines===
The Scorpio Mark II was available in the following levels of trim (each one being available as a saloon or an estate and with any engine). Regardless of the trim level, any car with a 2.9 Cosworth engine was fitted with traction control, cruise control and an automatic gearbox as standard (a manual gearbox could not be specified at all). All other engines could be fitted with either a manual or automatic transmission although, in practice, the vast majority of Scorpios were automatic.

*Executive: The base model, although even this had a high level of specification including electric windows, ABS, PAS as well as an alarm and immobiliser.
*Ghia: This level added air conditioning, alloy wheels, front fog lights and electric mirrors as well as a variety of minor additions.
*Ultima: The highest level added a CD autochanger, climate control, leather seats, cruise control and an automatically dimming mirror, and electrically operated seats as well as a variety of other minor improvements.

Some Ultima versions were fitted with a VM Motori 2.5 litre turbo diesel engine. The VM halves the fuel bills but suffered from turbo lag and a tendency to all-or-nothing acceleration.

Unusually trim levels and engine sizes were not liveried on the backs of the cars. Rather the trim levels were liveried on the sides of the cars by the Scorpio badges on the rear window frames as such. The Executive had no badge, simply the word &quot;Scorpio&quot;. Each other model had the model name under the badge, for example &quot;Scorpio Ultima.&quot;

Engine sizes were also on the sides of the cars towards the front just above the auxiliary indicator lights as such:

*2.0 L: no badge (on older cars the two litre 8 valve had no badge but the two litre sixteen valve bore had the badge &quot;2.0 16v&quot;)
*2.3 L: &quot;2.3&quot; (on older cars &quot;2.3 16v&quot;)
*2.9 L: &quot;2.9&quot; (on older cars &quot;2.9 12v&quot;)
*2.9 L: Cosworth &quot;24v&quot;

Unlike the Mark I Scorpio, the word &quot;Cosworth&quot; did not appear anywhere on the outside of cars fitted with such an engine (possibly in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of vehicle theft) although it is in evidence across the top of the engine. However, on the 1998 facelift, the Cosworth badge is clearly visible on the trunk lid. The output of the Cosworth V6 had also been increased from to for the second generation.

<text>Chris Gaines is a one-off fictional rock persona created as a movie character for Garth Brooks to explore musical styles far removed from his success as a country singer.

Initially, Brooks planned to feature the Gaines persona in &quot;The Lamb&quot;, a motion picture that never materialized. In 1999, Brooks released &quot;Garth Brooks in...the Life of Chris Gaines&quot;, his only album as Gaines. The album produced two charting &quot;Billboard&quot; singles, including the top 5 pop hit &quot;Lost in You&quot;.

== History ==
In 1999, Brooks and his production company Red Strokes Entertainment, with Paramount Pictures, began to develop a film in which Brooks would star. &quot;The Lamb&quot; was to have revolved around Chris Gaines, a fictional rock singer and his emotionally conflicted life as a musician in the public eye. To create buzz for the project, Brooks took on the identity of Gaines in the October 1999 album &quot;Garth Brooks in...the Life of Chris Gaines&quot;, which was intended as a &quot;pre-soundtrack&quot; to the film. The project – a departure from Brooks&#x27; usual material – was intended to represent the &quot;greatest hits&quot; of Gaines&#x27; entire career, spanning several decades of supposed recordings. Although Brooks himself developed the Gaines character and backstory, he did not write any of the songs on the album.

To promote the album&#x27;s release, Brooks appeared as Gaines in a television &quot;mockumentary&quot; for the VH1 series &quot;Behind the Music&quot; and as the musical guest on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which he hosted as himself.

The album – and Brooks&#x27; promotion of it – received a lukewarm reception. The album received mixed reviews, and Brooks&#x27; fans responded with general confusion as to the purpose of the project. Although the album made it to No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, expectations had been higher and retail stores began heavily discounting their oversupply. Less than expected sales of the album (more than two million) and no further developments in the production of the film, as a result, brought the project to an indefinite hiatus in February 2001, and the Gaines character quickly faded into obscurity.

Despite the less than spectacular response to the project, Brooks gained his first – and, to date, only – Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 single with &quot;Lost in You&quot;, the first single from the album (Brooks had previously prevented his songs from appearing on the chart by refusing to release them to pop music radio stations). Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic speculated that the alternate persona and elaborate marketing scheme backfired, writing, &quot;When Brooks&#x27; new persona and his album were revealed to the public, they were unforgiving – they didn&#x27;t think he was playing a role, they simply thought he&#x27;d lost his mind.&quot; However, Erlewine gave the album a 3-out-of-5 stars rating and in the same review later wrote: &quot;Judged as Brooks&#x27; first pop album, it&#x27;s pretty good, and if it had been released that way, it likely would have been embraced by a wide audience.&quot;

In March 2021, Brooks announced that &quot;The Life of Chris Gaines&quot; was to be rereleased on multiple platforms, including digital and vinyl, adding that previously unreleased songs were also forthcoming.

<text>Malvern College is a fee-charging coeducational boarding and day school in Malvern, Worcestershire, England. It is a public school in the British sense of the term and is a member of the Rugby Group and of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference. Since its foundation in 1865, it has remained on the same grounds, which are located near the town centre of Great Malvern. The campus, now covering some 250 acres (101 ha), is near the Malvern Hills.

Among the alumni of the college are at least two Commonwealth prime ministers, two Nobel laureates (five Nobel Prizes including prep school alumni), an Olympic gold medalist and many other notable persons from various fields. The novelist C. S. Lewis, author of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, was a pupil of the school.
As of 27 January 2025 655 pupils aged between 13 and 19 were enrolled at the school. The The Downs Malvern in the nearby village of Colwall, is a prep school with about 175 pupils is a feeder for the College. The College also operates five overseas campuses in China, Egypt, Hong Kong and Tokyo which opened in September 2023.

==History==
Set in the Malvern Hills, the school&#x27;s location owes much to Malvern&#x27;s emergence in the nineteenth century as a fashionable spa resort, appreciated for its unpolluted air and the healing qualities of its famous spring water. The school opened its doors for the first time on 25 January 1865 under the headship of Arthur Faber. Initially, there were only twenty-four boys, of whom eleven were day boys, six masters and two houses, named Mr McDowall&#x27;s (No.1) and Mr Drew&#x27;s (No.2). The new school expanded. One year later, there were sixty-four boys. By 1875, there were 200 on the roll and five boarding houses ; by the end of the 19th century, the numbers had risen to more than 400 boys and ten houses. American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow visited the school in 1868, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Helena of the United Kingdom on speech-day in 1870, and Francis, Duke of Teck, and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge visited in 1891 with their daughter, Mary of Teck (later Queen Mary). Lord Randolph Churchill&#x27;s speech-day comments on education in 1889 were reported in &quot;The Times&quot;. The school was one of the twenty four public schools listed in the Public Schools Yearbook of 1889 and was incorporated by royal charter in 1928. Further expansion of pupil numbers and buildings continued between the end of the First World War in 1918 and the start of the Second World War in 1939.

During World War I and World War II, 457 and 258 former pupils, respectively, gave their lives. Seven former pupils took part in the Battle of Britain. In 1925, the War Memorial Library was built to the designs of Sir Aston Webb, with the chimney piece in the upper chamber created by Leonard Shuffrey.

During World War II, the college premises were requisitioned by the Admiralty between October 1939 and July 1940, and the school temporarily relocated to Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire. In 1942, its premises were again needed for governmental use, on this occasion by the Telecommunications Research Establishment and, from May 1942 to July 1946, the school was housed with Harrow School. QinetiQ, a private sector successor to the government&#x27;s original research facility, is still sited on former college land.

Having traditionally been a school for boys aged from 13 to 18 years old, in 1992 it merged with Ellerslie Girls’ School and Hillstone prep school to become a coeducational school for pupils aged 3 to 18 years old. The college also departed from the full boarding tradition of the English public school by allowing day pupils, although over two-thirds of pupils board. In September 2008, the College&#x27;s Prep School merged with The Downs prep school on the latter&#x27;s nearby site in Colwall, Herefordshire to form &quot;The Downs, Malvern College Prep School&quot;.

===Past developments===
The year 2008 also saw the start of a development scheme that included a new sports complex, new athletics and viewing facilities at the pitches and two new boarding houses. The sports complex and new houses were opened in October 2009. Ellerslie House was opened for girls, commemorating the eponymous former girls&#x27; school, and the other new house has become the new permanent residence for the boys of No. 7.

In 2010 part of the school suffered very serious damage when fire broke out on 10 April in one of the boarding houses. The 1871 Grade II listed building which was the boarding house for 55 girls and living accommodation of the housemistress and her family, was almost completely destroyed. Over 70 firefighters and 13 fire engines from Malvern, Worcester and Stourport-on-Severn depots fought the blaze. The fire was confined to the living quarters of the housemistress and her family, who were away at the time. No pupils were in the building, as the term had finished. The house reopened on 18 April.

The original preparatory school, Hillstone, opened in 1883. When the college went coeducational, Hillstone was absorbed into Malvern to become its prep department. The prep school merged with The Downs, a Quaker school founded in 1900, and the new school is now known as The Downs Malvern.

Boarding is available to pupils in the prep school aged 7 and above, who reside in a separate boarding house known as The Warren.

== Structure ==
=== Governance ===
The school is governed by a College Council of approximately fifteen members, chaired by Robin Black. Educationalist and former cricketer Antony Clark joined the school as Headmaster in 2008.

After Clark&#x27;s departure in 2019, Keith Metcalfe replaced him as Headmaster.

=== Educational and social care standards ===
An Ofsted report, following an October 2010 inspection, rated the school&#x27;s services against specific criteria and assigned an overall quality rating of Grade 1 (outstanding). This compares to an overall rating of Grade 2 (good) in the previous report published in 2008. In the latest report, &quot;organisation&quot; and health and safety provision were upgraded to Grade 1 while boarding accommodation was rated Grade 2. Other areas assessed included &quot;helping children to achieve&quot;, to &quot;make a positive contribution&quot; and to &quot;enjoy what they do&quot; and these remained Grade 1 (outstanding). The report states that four recommendations made in Ofsted&#x27;s last report had all been addressed and that the school &quot;delivers an outstanding service that continues to be developed&quot;.

== Curriculum ==
=== Structure ===
While academic success is considered important, emphasis is also placed on the all-round development of the individual rather than on academic results alone. In the Sixth Form, courses are offered at A-Level in art, business studies, classical civilisation, design and technology, drama and theatre studies, economics, English literature, geography, Greek, history, history of art, key skills, Latin, mathematics, modern languages (French, German, Spanish), music, music technology, physical education, politics and the sciences (biology, chemistry, physics). The International Baccalaureate (IB) has further been available in the Sixth Form at Malvern since 1992. Further courses and special arrangements are sometimes made for other courses upon request.

=== Academic performance ===
In both the 2008 and 2010 Ofsted reports, a Grade 1 (outstanding) rating was assigned for &quot;helping children to achieve&quot;, to &quot;make a positive contribution&quot; and to &quot;enjoy what they do&quot;. In 2010, the school was, according to OFSTED, ranked 28th among private schools for &quot;value added&quot; to its students&#x27; A Level results, placing it within the top 5% nationally. In 2011, it was 79th among co-ed independent boarding schools for A-Level results. The school&#x27;s pupils have achieved particularly good results at IB level. In 2011, the school was ranked 18th for the average grades of its IB pupils. In 2012, The Independent review of both A level and IB results, based on government-issued statistics, ranked Malvern 32nd in the UK with 1080.7 points. In 2019, 29% of pupils scored A*-A for their A-Levels examination, whereas 60% scored A*-A for their GCSEs. For IB, 27% of the 2019 cohort scored 40 or more IB points.

== Extracurricular activities ==

The college plays sports such as football, cricket, rugby, rackets, fives, athletics, tennis, squash, croquet, basketball, badminton, golf and polo. At the school, boys play hockey and girls play cricket and football.

On 16 October 2009, a new sports complex and hospitality suite was opened by The Duke of York. The opening was attended by several well known sports personalities including athlete Dame Kelly Holmes, cricketers Michael Vaughan and Graham Gooch, footballer Peter Shilton, rugby union player Jason Leonard, athlete Christina Boxer and hockey player Rachel Walker. The indoor complex, which was built on the site of the old sports hall and swimming pool, offers an 8 court sports hall, a dance studio and fitness suite, a climbing wall, two squash courts, a shooting range, a large function suite, and a 6 lane swimming pool and its facilities are also available for use by the wider community. They are also used by Worcestershire County Cricket Club for their winter training programme. In February 2010, the school also hosted the England Blind Cricket squad for training sessions.

== Traditions ==

The school song, &quot;Carmen Malvernense&quot;, was written and composed by two masters, M. A. Bayfield and R. E. Lyon. It was first sung on speech day in 1888. The same song became the school song of Eastbourne College when Bayfield became headmaster there in 1895, though presumably with a change of title.

The School holds 3 Chapel services every week, an assembly to deliver the main notices for the week ahead on Mondays, and Hymn Singing and other notices on Thursdays and Saturdays.

The School holds The Ledbury Run or the &quot;Ledder&quot; every year, where students from Year 11, Year 12, and Year 13 can sign up to take part in an approximately 8 Miles long Cross Country race from the town of Ledbury back to the college campus. While it is optional by nature, most boarding houses do encourage students to take part. Year 10 and Year 11 students may take part in the &quot;Junior Ledder&quot;, a shorter race which is approximately half the length.

==Innovations==

The college has a history of innovation in the field of education. In 1963, it was the first independent school to have a language laboratory. It is thought to be the first school in the country to have had a careers service. Under the direction of John Lewis, it pioneered Nuffield Physics in the 1960s, &quot;Science in Society&quot; in the 1970s, and the &quot;Diploma of Achievement&quot; in the 1990s. At the beginning of the 1990s, Malvern College became one of the first schools in Britain to offer the choice between the International Baccalaureate and A-Levels in the Sixth Form. The school was one of the first boys&#x27; public schools to become fully coeducational from the preparatory department to sixth form.

Each summer the staff and some older pupils run a summer school, Young Malvern, which incorporates many sports, activities and learning experiences. Malvern College is one of the two schools in the country (the other being Dulwich College) to offer debating in the curriculum and pupils participate in regional and national competitions including the Debating Matters competition and the Three Counties Tournament. The subject is compulsory at Foundation Year level.

==Overseas campuses==
The college has five overseas campuses under the governance of Malvern College International:

* Malvern College Qingdao
* Malvern College Chengdu both in Mainland China 
* Malvern College Egypt
* Malvern College Hong Kong located in Pak Shek Kok, New Territories, Hong Kong
* Malvern College Tokyo

A Swiss campus at Leysin has closed.

Since 2021 the Malvern College schools in China &amp; Hong Kong have been required to teach the National Curriculum of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

==Notable alumni==

Among the alumni of the college since its foundation in 1865 are Nobel laureates, Olympic gold medalists and many other notable persons from various fields including heads of state, high ranking military personnel, royalty, media personalities, scientists, and sports people.

The school&#x27;s alumni (&quot;old boys&quot;) are known as &quot;Old Malvernians&quot;, or &quot;OMs&quot;. The Malvernian Society holds many annual reunions and events. Old Malvernians, including former pupils of The Downs, Hillstone, and Ellerslie schools which have merged with Malvern College, benefit from a remission in fees for their own children. Other Old Malvernian clubs and societies include OM Lodge, Court Games, Golf, Sailing, Shooting, the Old Malvernians Cricket Club, and the Old Malvernians Football Club, a club competing in the Arthurian League.

Among the school&#x27;s alumni is Najib Razak, a pupil of the school from 1968 to 1971, who served as the 6th Prime Minister of Malaysia from 2009 to 2018. In 2020 he was convicted of corruption in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, and in 2022 began serving a sentence of imprisonment.

Old Malvernians have been instrumental in the formation of sporting and charitable organisations such as Blackburn Rovers FC and the &quot;Docklands Settlements&quot;.

<text>Edwin McMasters Stanton (December 19, 1814December 24, 1869) was an American lawyer and politician who served as U.S. secretary of war under the Lincoln Administration during most of the American Civil War. Stanton&#x27;s management helped organize the massive military resources of the North and guide the Union to victory. However, he was criticized by many Union generals, who perceived him as overcautious and a micromanager. He also organized the manhunt for Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassin, John Wilkes Booth.

After Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Stanton remained as the secretary of war under the new U.S. president, Andrew Johnson, during the first years of Reconstruction. He opposed the lenient policies of Johnson towards the former Confederate States. Johnson&#x27;s attempt to dismiss Stanton ultimately led to Johnson being impeached by the Radical Republicans in the House of Representatives. Stanton returned to law after he retired as secretary of war. In 1869, he was nominated as an associate justice of the Supreme Court by Johnson&#x27;s successor, Ulysses S. Grant, but Stanton died four days after his nomination was confirmed by the Senate. He remains the only confirmed nominee to accept but die before serving on the Court.

==Family and early life==

===Ancestry===
Before the American Revolution, Stanton&#x27;s paternal ancestors, the Stantons and the Macys, both of whom were Quakers, moved from Massachusetts to North Carolina. In 1774, Stanton&#x27;s grandfather, Benjamin Stanton, married Abigail Macy. Benjamin died in 1800. That year, Abigail moved to the Northwest Territory, accompanied by much of her family. Soon, Ohio was admitted to the Union, and Macy proved to be one of the early developers of the new state. She bought a tract of land at Mount Pleasant, Ohio, from the government and settled there. One of her sons, David, became a physician in Steubenville, and married Lucy Norman, the daughter of a Virginia planter. Their marriage was met with the ire of Ohio&#x27;s Quaker community, as Lucy was a Methodist, and not a Quaker. This forced David Stanton to abandon the Quaker sect.

===Early life and education===

Edwin McMasters was born to David and Lucy Stanton on December 19, 1814, in Steubenville, Ohio, the first of their four children. Edwin&#x27;s early formal education consisted of a private school and a seminary behind the Stantons&#x27; residence, called &quot;Old Academy&quot;. When he was ten, he was transferred to a school taught by a Presbyterian minister. It was also at ten that Edwin experienced his first asthma attack, a malady that would haunt him for life, sometimes to the point of convulsion. Because of his asthma he was unable to participate in highly physical activities, so he found interest in books and poetry. Edwin attended Methodist church services and Sunday school regularly. At the age of thirteen, Stanton became a full member of the Methodist church.

David Stanton&#x27;s medical practice afforded him and his family a decent living. When David Stanton suddenly died in December 1827 at his residence, Edwin and family were left destitute. Edwin&#x27;s mother opened a store in the front room of their residence, selling the medical supplies her husband left her, along with books, stationery and groceries. The youthful Edwin was removed from school, and worked at the store of a local bookseller.

Stanton began his college studies at the Episcopal Church-affiliated Kenyon College in 1831. At Kenyon, Stanton was involved in the college&#x27;s Philomathesian Literary Society. Stanton sat on several of the society&#x27;s committees and often partook in its exercises and debates. Stanton was forced to leave Kenyon just at the end of his third semester for lack of finances. At Kenyon, his support of President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s actions during the 1832 Nullification Crisis, a hotly debated topic among the Philomathesians, led him into the Democratic Party. Further, Stanton&#x27;s conversion to Episcopalianism and his revulsion of the practice of slavery were solidified there. After Kenyon, Stanton worked as a bookseller in Columbus. Stanton had hoped to obtain enough money to complete his final year at Kenyon. However, a small salary at the bookstore dashed the notion. He soon returned to Steubenville to pursue studies in law.

===Early career and first marriage===
Stanton studied law under the tutelage of Daniel Collier in preparation for the bar. He was admitted to practice in 1835, and began work at a prominent law firm in Cadiz, Ohio, under Chauncey Dewey, a well-known attorney. The firm&#x27;s trial work often fell to him.
At the age of 18, Stanton met Mary Ann Lamson at Trinity Episcopal Church in Columbus, and they soon were engaged. After buying a home in Cadiz, Stanton went to Columbus where his betrothed was. Stanton and Lamson had wished to be married at Trinity Episcopal, but Stanton&#x27;s illness rendered this idea moot. Instead, the ceremony was performed at the home of Trinity Episcopal&#x27;s rector on December 31, 1836. Afterwards, Stanton went to Virginia where his mother and sisters were, and escorted the women back to Cadiz, where they would live with him and his wife.

After his marriage, Stanton partnered with the lawyer and federal judge Benjamin Tappan. Stanton&#x27;s sister also married Tappan&#x27;s son. In Cadiz, Stanton was situated prominently in the local community. He worked with the town&#x27;s anti-slavery society, and with a local newspaper, the &quot;Sentinel&quot;, writing and editing articles there. In 1837, Stanton was elected the prosecutor of Harrison County, on the Democratic ticket. Further, Stanton&#x27;s increasing wealth allowed him to purchase a large tract of land in Washington County, and several tracts in Cadiz.

==Rising attorney (1839–1860)==

===Return to Steubenville===

Stanton&#x27;s relationship with Benjamin Tappan expanded when Tappan was elected the United States Senator from Ohio in 1838. Tappan asked Stanton to oversee his law operations, which were based in Steubenville. When his time as county prosecutor was finished, Stanton moved back to the town. Stanton&#x27;s work in politics also expanded. He served as a delegate at the Democrats&#x27; 1840 national convention in Baltimore, and was featured prominently in Martin Van Buren&#x27;s campaign in the 1840 presidential election, which Van Buren lost.

He was a member of Steubenville Lodge No. 45 in Steubenville, Ohio, and when he moved to Pittsburgh became a member of Washington Lodge No. 253 on 25 March 1852 as a charter member. He resigned on 29 Nov. 1859. pp. 189-81.“ (Denslow, William R. &quot;10,000 Famous Freemasons.&quot; Independence, Missouri: Missouri Lodge of Research, 1957. )

In Steubenville, the Stantons welcomed two children. Their daughter, Lucy Lamson, was born in March 1840. Within months of her birth, Lucy was stricken with an unknown illness. Stanton put aside his work to spend that summer at baby Lucy&#x27;s bedside. She died in 1841, shortly after her second birthday. Their son, Edwin Lamson, was born in August 1842. The boy&#x27;s birth refreshed the spirits in the Stanton household after baby Lucy&#x27;s death. Unlike Lucy&#x27;s early years, Edwin was healthy and active. Grief, however, would return once again to the Stanton household in 1844, when Mary Stanton was left bedridden by a bilious fever. Never recovering, she died in March 1844. Stanton&#x27;s sorrow &quot;verged on insanity&quot;, say historians Benjamin P. Thomas and Harold M. Hyman. He had Mary&#x27;s burial attire redone repeatedly, as he demanded she look just as she had when they were wed seven years prior. In the evenings, Stanton would emerge from his room with his eyes filled with tears and search the house frantically with a lamp, all the while asking, &quot;Where is Mary?&quot;

Stanton regrouped and began to focus on his cases by the summer. One such case was defending Caleb J. McNulty, whom Stanton had previously labelled &quot;a glorious fellow&quot;. McNulty, a Democrat, was dismissed from his clerkship of the United States House of Representatives by unanimous vote and charged with embezzlement when thousands of the House&#x27;s money went missing. Democrats, fearing their party&#x27;s disrepute, made clamorous cries for McNulty to be punished, and his conviction was viewed as a foregone conclusion. Stanton, at Tappan&#x27;s request, came on as McNulty&#x27;s defense. Stanton brought a motion to dismiss McNulty&#x27;s indictment. He employed the use of numerous technicalities and, to the shock and applause of the courtroom, the motion was granted with all charges against McNulty dropped. As every detail of the affair was covered by newspapers around the country, Stanton&#x27;s name was featured prominently nationwide.

After the McNulty scandal, Stanton and Tappan parted ways professionally. Stanton formed a partnership with one of his former students, George Wythe McCook of the &quot;Fighting McCooks&quot;. At the beginning of the Mexican–American War, men across the country hastened to enlist in the United States Army, with McCook among them. Stanton might have enlisted as well, if not for his doctor&#x27;s fears about his asthma. Instead, he focused on law. Stanton&#x27;s practice was no longer only in Ohio, having expanded to Virginia and Pennsylvania. He concluded that Steubenville would no longer prove adequate as a headquarters, and thought Pittsburgh most appropriate for his new base. He was admitted to the bar there by late 1847.

===Attorney in Pittsburgh===

In Pittsburgh, Stanton formed a partnership with a prominent retired judge, Charles Shaler, while maintaining his collaboration with McCook, who had remained in Steubenville after returning from service in the Mexican–American War. Stanton argued several high-profile suits. One such proceeding was &quot;State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company and others&quot; in the United States Supreme Court. The case concerned the Wheeling Suspension Bridge, the largest suspension bridge in the world at that time, and an important connector for the National Road. The bridge&#x27;s center rose some but proved to be a nuisance to passing ships with tall smokestacks. With ships unable to clear the bridge, enormous amounts of traffic, trade and commerce would be redirected to Wheeling, West Virginia, which at the time was still part of Virginia. On August 16, 1849, he urged the Supreme Court to enjoin Wheeling and Belmont, as the bridge was obstructing traffic into Pennsylvania, and hindering trade and commerce. Associate Justice R. C. Grier directed those who were aggrieved by the bridge&#x27;s operations to go to a lower court, but left an avenue open for Stanton to file for an injunction in the Supreme Court, which he did.

Oral arguments for the &quot;Pennsylvania v.&quot; &quot;Wheeling and Belmont&quot; began on February 25, 1850, which was also when Stanton was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court. Wheeling and Belmont argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matters concerning the case; the justices disagreed. The case proceeded, allowing Stanton to exhibit a dramatic stunt, which was widely reported on and demonstrated how the bridge was a hindrance—he had the steamer &quot;Hibernia&quot; ram its smokestack into the bridge, which destroyed it and a piece of the ship itself. May 1850 saw the case handed over to Reuben H. Walworth, the former Chancellor of New York, who returned a vivid opinion in February 1851 stating that the Wheeling Bridge was &quot;an unwarranted and unlawful obstruction to navigation, and that it must be either removed or raised so as to permit the free and usual passage of boats.&quot; The Supreme Court concurred; in May 1852, the court ordered in a 7–2 ruling that the bridge&#x27;s height be increased to . Wheeling and Belmont were unsatisfied with the ruling and asked Congress to act. To Stanton&#x27;s horror, a bill declaring the Wheeling bridge permissible became law on August 31, effectively overriding the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling and authority. Stanton was disgruntled that the purpose of the court—to peacefully decide and remedy disputes between states—had been diminished by Congress.

===&quot;McCormick v. Manny&quot; ===

A by-effect of Stanton&#x27;s performance in &quot;Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont&quot; was that he was sought after for other prominent cases, such as the McCormick Reaper patent case of inventor Cyrus McCormick. In 1831, a young McCormick created a machine to harvest crops. The device was particularly useful in the burgeoning wheat fields of the Western United States. Demand for McCormick&#x27;s invention grew rapidly, attracting fierce competition, especially from fellow inventor and businessman John Henry Manny. In 1854 McCormick and his two prominent lawyers, Reverdy Johnson and Edward M. Dickinson, filed suit against Manny claiming he had infringed on McCormick&#x27;s patents. McCormick demanded an injunction on Manny&#x27;s reaper. Manny was also defended by two esteemed lawyers, George Harding and Peter H. Watson. &quot;McCormick v. Manny&quot; was initially to be tried in Chicago, and the two lawyers wanted another attorney local to the city to join their team; the recommended choice was Abraham Lincoln. When Watson met Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois, he had a dim first impression of him, but after speaking with Lincoln, Watson saw that he might be a good choice. However, when the venue of the proceedings was transferred to Cincinnati rather than Chicago, and the necessity for Lincoln was negated, Harding and Watson went for their first choice, Edwin Stanton. Lincoln was not made aware that he had been replaced, and still appeared at the proceedings in Cincinnati with his arguments prepared. Stanton&#x27;s apprehension towards Lincoln was immediate and severe, and he did well to indicate to Lincoln that he wanted him to absent himself from the case. The case proceeded with Harding, Watson and Stanton and Manny&#x27;s true defenders; Lincoln did not actively participate in the planning or arguing of the case, but stayed in Cincinnati as a spectator.

Stanton&#x27;s role in Manny&#x27;s legal trio was as a researcher. Though he admitted that George Harding, an established patent lawyer, was more adept at the scientific aspects of the case, Stanton worked to summarize the relevant jurisprudence and case law. To win &quot;McCormick v. Manny&quot; for Manny, Stanton, Harding and Watson had to impress upon the court that McCormick had no claim to exclusivity in his reaper&#x27;s use of a divider, a mechanism on the outer end of the cutter-bar which separated the grain. A harvesting machine would not have worked properly without a divider, and Manny&#x27;s defense knew this. However, to assure a win, Watson opted to use duplicity—he employed a model maker named William P. Wood to retrieve an older version of McCormick&#x27;s reaper and alter it to be presented in court. Wood found a reaper in Virginia which was built in 1844, one year prior to McCormick&#x27;s patent being granted. He had a blacksmith straighten the curved divider, knowing that the curved divider in Manny&#x27;s reaper would not conflict with a straight one in McCormick&#x27;s reaper. After using a salt and vinegar solution to add rust to where the blacksmith had worked to ensure the antiquity of the machine was undeniable, Wood sent the reaper to Cincinnati. Stanton was joyed when he examined the altered reaper, and knew the case was theirs. Arguments for the case began in September 1855. In March 1856, Justices John McLean and Thomas Drummond delivered a ruling in favor of John Manny. McCormick appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and &quot;McCormick v. Manny&quot;, was, all of a sudden, a political issue, and the matters concerning the case found their way to the floor of Congress. Stanton would later appoint Wood to be superintendent of the military prisons of the District of Columbia during the Civil War.

===Second marriage===
In February 1856 Stanton became engaged to Ellen Hutchinson, sixteen years Stanton&#x27;s junior. She came from a prominent family in the city; her father was Lewis Hutchinson, a wealthy merchant and warehouseman and a descendant of Meriwether Lewis. They were married on June 25, 1856, at Hutchinson&#x27;s father&#x27;s home. Stanton moved to Washington where Stanton expected important work with the Supreme Court. 

===Emergence in Washington===

In Pennsylvania, Stanton had become intimately acquainted with Jeremiah S. Black, the chief judge in the state&#x27;s supreme court. This friendship proved profitable for Stanton when in March 1857, the recently inaugurated fifteenth President, James Buchanan, made Black his Attorney General. Black&#x27;s accession to his new post was soon met with a land claims issue in California. In the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican–American War and gave California to the United States, the United States agreed to recognize valid land grants by Mexican authorities. This was followed by the California Land Claims Act of 1851, which established a board to review claims to California lands. One such claim was made by Joseph Yves Limantour, a French-born merchant who asserted ownership of an assemblage of lands that included important sections of the state, such as a sizeable part of San Francisco. When his claims were recognized by the land commissioners, the U.S. government appealed. Meanwhile, Black corresponded with a person named Auguste Jouan, who stated that Limantour&#x27;s claims were invalid, and that he, under Limantour&#x27;s employ, forged the date listed on one of the approved grants. Black needed an individual loyal to the Democratic Party and to the Buchanan administration, who could faithfully represent the administration&#x27;s interests in California; he chose Stanton.

Ellen Stanton loathed the idea. In California Edwin would be thousands of miles away from her for what was sure to be months, leaving her lonely in Washington, where she had few friends. Moreover, on May 9, 1857, Ellen had a daughter whom the Stantons named Eleanor Adams. After the girl&#x27;s delivery, Ellen fell ill, which frightened Edwin and delayed his decision to go to California. In October 1857 Stanton finally agreed to represent the Buchanan administration&#x27;s interests in California. Having agreed to a compensation of $25,000, (~$ in ) Stanton set sail from New York on February 19, 1858, aboard the &quot;Star of the West&quot;, along with his son Eddie, James Buchanan Jr., the President&#x27;s nephew, and Lieutenant H. N. Harrison, who was assigned to Stanton&#x27;s detail by the Navy. After a tempestuous voyage, the company docked in Kingston, Jamaica, where slavery was disallowed. On the island, the climate pleased Stanton greatly, and at a church there, Stanton was surprised to see blacks and whites sitting together. Afterwards, Stanton and his entourage landed in Panama, and left there on a ship three times larger than the one on which they came, the &quot;Sonora&quot;. On March 19 the company finally docked in San Francisco, and bunkered at the International Hotel.

Stanton took to his work with haste. In aid of his case Stanton, along with his entire party and two clerks, went about arranging disordered records from California&#x27;s time under Mexico. The &quot;Jemino Index&quot; that he uncovered gave information on land grants up to 1844, and with the assistance of a Congressional act, Stanton unearthed records from all over the state pertaining to Mexican grants. Stanton and company worked for months sorting the land archives; meanwhile, Stanton&#x27;s arrival in California produced gossip and scorn from locals, especially from those whose land claims would be in jeopardy should Stanton&#x27;s work prove victorious. Further, President Buchanan and Senator Douglas were wrestling for control of California, and Stanton was caught in the crosshairs, resulting in a defamatory campaign against Stanton by Douglas&#x27; supporters. The campaign disheartened Stanton, but barely distracted him.

Limantour had built up a speciously substantial case. He had accrued a preponderance of ostensibly sound evidence, such as witness testimony, grants signed by Manuel Micheltorena, the Mexican governor of California prior to cessation, and paper with a special Mexican government stamp. However, Auguste Jouan&#x27;s information was instrumental in Stanton&#x27;s case. According to Jouan, Limantour had received dozens of blank documents signed by Governor Micheltorena, which Limantour could fill in as he willed. Further, Jouan had borne a hole in one of the papers to erase something, a hole that was still present in the document. Stanton also acquired letters that explicitly laid out the fraud, and stamps used by customs officials, one authentic and the other fraudulent. The fraudulent one had been used eleven times, all on Limantour&#x27;s documents. When Stanton sent to the Minister of the Exterior in Mexico City, they could not locate records corroborating Limantour&#x27;s grants. In late 1858 Limantour&#x27;s claims were denied by the land commission, and he was arrested on perjury charges. He posted a $35,000 bail and left the country.

As 1858 drew to a close, and Stanton prepared to return home, Eddie became sick. Whenever Stanton made arrangements to leave California, his son&#x27;s condition grew worse. Edwin had written Ellen as often as he could as her anxiety and loneliness increased in Washington. She criticized him for leaving her in the town alone with young &quot;Ellie&quot;. January 3, 1859, saw Stanton and company leave San Francisco. He was home in early February. In the nation&#x27;s capital Stanton advised President Buchanan on patronage, and helped Attorney General Black extensively, even being mistaken as an Assistant Attorney General. Nonetheless, Stanton&#x27;s affairs in Washington paled in comparison to the excitement he had experienced on the other side of the country—at least until he found himself defending a man who had become fodder for sensationalists and gossipers around the country.

===Daniel Sickles trial===

Daniel Sickles was a member of the United States House of Representatives from New York. He was married to Teresa Bagioli Sickles, the daughter of composer Antonio Bagioli. Sickles&#x27; wife had begun an affair with Philip Barton Key, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia and the son of Francis Scott Key, writer of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. On Sunday, February 27, 1859, Sickles confronted Key in Lafayette Square, declaring, &quot;Key, you scoundrel, you have dishonored my home; you must die&quot;, then shot Key to death. Sickles then went to the home of Attorney General Black and admitted his crime. The subsequent Thursday he was charged with murder by a grand jury. The Sickles affair gained nationwide media attention for both its scandalous nature and its proximity to the White House. Soon, the press speculated that Daniel Sickles&#x27; political esteem was on the account of an affair between his wife and President Buchanan. Prominent criminal lawyer James T. Brady and his partner, John Graham, came to Sickles&#x27; defense, and solicited Stanton to join their team.
Arguments for the trial began on April 4. The prosecution wanted to advance the theory that Sickles had also committed adultery and did not pay very much mind to his wife or her activities. When the judge disallowed this, the prosecution opted instead to highlight the heinous nature of Sickles&#x27; murder, and not address his reasons for doing the crime. Sickles&#x27; defense countered that Sickles had suffered from a temporary bout of insanity, the first successful such instance of an insanity plea in American jurisprudence. The events in the courtroom during the trial were nothing if not dramatic. When Stanton delivered closing arguments, stating that marriage is sacred and that a man should have the right to defend his marriage against those who chose to defile the purity of the sacrament, the courtroom erupted in cheers. A law student described Stanton&#x27;s argument during the trial, &quot;a typical piece of Victorian rhetoric, an ingenious thesaurus of aphorisms on the sanctity of the family.&quot; The jury in the case deliberated for just over an hour before declaring Sickles not guilty. The judge ordered that Sickles be released from his arrest. Outside the courthouse, Sickles, Stanton and company met a throng of individuals in adulation of the victory.

==Early work in politics (1860–1862)==
During the 1860 United States presidential election Stanton supported Vice President John C. Breckinridge, due to his work with the Buchanan administration and his belief that only a win by Breckinridge would keep the country together. Privately he predicted that Lincoln would win.

===In Buchanan&#x27;s cabinet===
In late 1860, President Buchanan was formulating his yearly State of the Union address to Congress, and asked Attorney General Black to offer insight into the legality and constitutionality of secession. Black then asked Stanton for advice. Stanton approved a strongly worded draft of Black&#x27;s response to Buchanan, which denounced secession from the Union as illegal. Buchanan gave his address to Congress on December 3. Meanwhile, Buchanan&#x27;s cabinet were growing more discontent with his handling of secession, and several members deemed him too weak on the issue. On December 5th, his Secretary of the Treasury, Howell Cobb resigned. On December 9th, Secretary of State Lewis Cass, disgruntled over Buchanan&#x27;s failure to defend the government&#x27;s interests in the South, tendered his resignation. Black was nominated to replace Cass on December 12. About a week later, Stanton, at the time in Cincinnati, was told to come to Washington at once, for he had been confirmed by the Senate as Buchanan&#x27;s new Attorney General. He was sworn in on December 20th.

Stanton met a cabinet in disarray over the issue of secession. Buchanan did not want to agitate the South any further, and sympathized with the South&#x27;s cause. On December 9th, Buchanan had agreed with South Carolinian congressmen that the military installations in the state would not be reinforced unless force against them was perpetrated. However, on the day that Stanton assumed his position, Maj. Robert Anderson moved his unit to Fort Sumter, South Carolina, which the Southerners viewed as Buchanan reneging on his promise. South Carolina issued an ordinance of secession soon after, declaring itself independent of the United States. The South Carolinians demanded that federal forces leave Charleston Harbor altogether; they threatened carnage if they did not get compliance. The following day, Buchanan gave his cabinet a draft of his response to the South Carolinians. Secretaries Thompson and Philip Francis Thomas, of the Treasury Department, thought the President&#x27;s response too pugnacious; Stanton, Black and Postmaster General Joseph Holt thought it too placatory. Isaac Toucey, Secretary of the Navy, was alone in his support of the response.

Stanton was unnerved by Buchanan&#x27;s ambivalence towards the South Carolina secession crisis, and wanted to stiffen him against complying to the South&#x27;s demands. On December 30th, Black came to Stanton&#x27;s home, and the two agreed to pen their objections to Buchanan ordering a withdrawal from Fort Sumter. If he did such a thing, the two men, along with Postmaster General Holt, agreed that they would resign, delivering a crippling blow to the administration. Buchanan obliged them. The South Carolinian delegates got their response from President Buchanan on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1860; the President would not withdraw forces from Charleston Harbor.

By February 1st, six Southern states had followed South Carolina&#x27;s lead and passed ordinances of secession, declaring themselves to no longer be a part of the United States. On February 18th, Jefferson Davis was sworn in as the President of the Confederate States. Meanwhile, Washington was astir with talk of coups and conspiracies. Stanton thought that discord would ravage the capital on February 13, when electoral votes were being counted; nothing happened. Again, Stanton thought, when Lincoln was sworn in on March 4th there would be violence; this did not come to pass. Lincoln&#x27;s inauguration did give Stanton a flickering of hope that his efforts to keep Fort Sumter defended would not be in vain, and that Southern aggression would be met with force in the North. In his inauguration speech, Lincoln did not say he would outlaw slavery throughout the nation, but he did say that he would not support secession in any form, and that any attempt to leave the Union was not lawful. In Stanton, Lincoln&#x27;s words were met with cautious optimism. The new president submitted his choices for his cabinet on March 5, and by that day&#x27;s end, Stanton was no longer the attorney general. He lingered in his office for a while to help settle in and guide his replacement, Edward Bates.

===Cameron&#x27;s advisor===

On July 21st, the North and the South experienced their first major clash at Manassas Junction in Virginia, the First Battle of Bull Run. Northerners thought the battle would end the war, and defeat the Confederacy decisively; however, the bloody encounter ended with the Union Army retreating to Washington. Lincoln wanted to bolster Northern numbers afterwards, with many in the North believing the war would be more arduous than they initially expected, but when more than 250,000 men signed up, the federal government did not have enough supplies for them. The War Department had states buy the supplies, assuring them that they would be reimbursed. This led to states selling the federal government items that were usually damaged or worthless at very high prices. Nonetheless, the government bought them.

Soon, Simon Cameron, Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of War, was being accused of incompetently handling his department, and some wanted him to resign. Cameron sought out Stanton to advise him on legal matters concerning the War Department&#x27;s acquisitions, among other things. Calls for Cameron to resign grew louder when he endorsed a bombastic November 1861 speech given by Col. John Cochrane to his unit. &quot;[W]e should take the slave by the hand, placing a musket in it, and bid him in God&#x27;s name strike for the liberty of the human race&quot;, Cochrane said. Cameron embraced Cochrane&#x27;s sentiment that slaves should be armed, but it was met with repudiation in Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet. Caleb B. Smith, the Secretary in the Department of the Interior, scolded Cameron for his support of Cochrane.

Cameron inserted a call to arm the slaves in his report to Congress, which would be sent along with Lincoln&#x27;s address to the legislature. Cameron gave the report to Stanton, who amended it with a passage that went even further in demanding that slaves be armed, stating that those who rebel against the government lose their claims to any type of property, including slaves, and that it was &quot;clearly the right of the Government to arm slaves when it may become necessary as it is to use gunpowder or guns taken from the enemy&quot;. Cameron gave the report to Lincoln, and sent several copies to Congress and the press. Lincoln wanted the portions containing calls to arm the slaves removed, and ordered the transmission of Cameron&#x27;s report be stopped and replaced with an altered version. Congress received the version without the call to arm slaves, while the press received a version with it. When newspapers published the document in its entirety, Lincoln was excoriated by Republicans, who thought him weak on the issue of slavery, and disliked that he wanted the plea to arm slaves removed.

The President resolved to dismiss Cameron when abolitionists in the North settled over the controversy. Cameron would not resign until he was sure of his successor, and that he could leave the cabinet without damaging his reputation. When a vacancy in the post of Minister to Russia presented itself, Cameron and Lincoln agreed that he would fill the post when he resigned. As for a successor, Lincoln thought Joseph Holt best for the job, but his Secretary of State, William H. Seward, wanted Stanton to succeed Cameron. Salmon Chase, Stanton&#x27;s friend and Lincoln&#x27;s Treasury Secretary, agreed. Stanton had been preparing for a partnership with Samuel L. M. Barlow in New York, but abandoned these plans when he heard of his possible nomination. Lincoln nominated Stanton to the post of Secretary of War on January 13. He was confirmed two days following.

==Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of War (1862–1865)==

===Early days in office===
Under Cameron, the War Department had earned the moniker &quot;the lunatic asylum.&quot; The department was barely respected among soldiers or government officials, and its authority was routinely disregarded. The army&#x27;s generals held the brunt of the operating authority in the military, while the President and the War Department interceded only in exceptional circumstances. The department also had strained relations with Congress, especially Representative John Fox Potter, head of the House&#x27;s &quot;Committee on Loyalty of Federal employees&quot;, which sought to root out Confederate sympathizers in the government. Potter had prodded Cameron to remove about fifty individuals he suspected of Confederate sympathies; Cameron had paid him no mind.

Stanton was sworn in on January 20. Immediately, he set about repairing the fractious relationship between Congress and the War Department. Stanton met with Potter on his first day as secretary, and on the same day, dismissed four persons whom Potter deemed unsavory. This was well short of the fifty people Potter wanted gone from the department, but he was nonetheless pleased. Stanton also met with Senator Benjamin Wade and his Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War. The committee was a necessary and fruitful ally; it had subpoena power, thus allowing it to acquire information Stanton could not, and could help Stanton remove War Department staffers. Wade and his committee were happy to find an ally in the executive branch, and met with Stanton often thereafter. Stanton made a number of organizational changes within the department as well. He appointed John Tucker, an executive at the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, and Peter H. Watson, his partner in the reaper case, to be his assistant secretaries, and had the staff at the department expanded by over sixty employees. Further, Stanton appealed to the Senate to cease appointments of military officials until he could review the more than 1,400 individuals up for promotion. Hitherto, military promotions were a spoils system, where individuals favorable to the administration were given promotions, regardless of merit. This ceased under Stanton.

On January 29 Stanton ordered that all contracts to manufacturers of military materials and supplies outside the United States be voided and replaced with contracts within the country, and that no such further contracts be made with foreign companies. The order provoked apprehension in Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet. The United Kingdom and France were searching for cause to recognize and support the Confederates, and Stanton&#x27;s order may have given it to them. Secretary of State Seward thought the order would &quot;complicate the foreign situation.&quot; Stanton persisted, and his January 29 order stood.

Meanwhile, Stanton worked to create an effective transportation and communication network across the North. His efforts focused on the railroad system and the telegraph lines. Stanton worked with Senator Wade to push through Congress a bill that would codify the ability of the President and his administration to forcibly seize railroad and telegraph lines for their purposes. Railroad companies in the North were accommodating to the needs and desires of the federal government for the most part, and the law was rarely used. Stanton also secured the government&#x27;s use of telegraph. He relocated the military&#x27;s telegraphing operations from McClellan&#x27;s army headquarters to his department, a decision the general was none too pleased with. The relocation gave Stanton closer control over the military&#x27;s communications operations, and he exploited this. Stanton forced all members of the press to work through Assistant Secretary Watson, where unwanted journalists would be disallowed access to official government correspondence. If a member of the press went elsewhere in the department, they would be charged with espionage.

Prior to Stanton&#x27;s incumbency as War Secretary, President Lincoln apportioned responsibility for the security of government against treachery and other unsavory activities to several members of his cabinet, mostly Secretary Seward, as he did not trust Attorney General Bates or Secretary Cameron. Under Secretary Stanton, the War Department would have consolidated responsibility for internal security. A lynchpin of Seward&#x27;s strategy to maintain internal security was the use of arbitrary arrests and detentions, and Stanton continued this practice. Democrats harshly criticized the use of arbitrary arrests, but Lincoln contended that it was his primary responsibility to maintain the integrity and security of the government, and that waiting until possible betrayers committed guilty acts would hurt the government. At Stanton&#x27;s behest, Seward continued the detention of only the most risky inmates, and released all others.

===General-in-Chief===

Lincoln eventually grew tired of McClellan&#x27;s inaction, especially after his January 27, 1862, order to advance against the Confederates in the Eastern Theatre had provoked little military response from McClellan. On March 11, Lincoln relieved McClellan of his position as general-in-chief of the whole Union army—leaving him in charge of only the Army of the Potomac—and replaced him with Stanton. This created a bitter chasm in the relationship between Stanton and McClellan, and led McClellan&#x27;s supporters to claim that Stanton &quot;usurped&quot; the role of general-in-chief, and that a Secretary of War should be subordinate to military commanders. Lincoln ignored such calls, leaving military power consolidated with himself and Stanton.

Meanwhile, McClellan was preparing for the first major military operation in the Eastern Theatre, the Peninsula Campaign. The Army of the Potomac began its movement to the Virginia Peninsula on March 17. The first action of the campaign was at Yorktown. Lincoln wanted McClellan to attack the town outright, but McClellan&#x27;s inspection of the Confederate defensive works there compelled him to lay siege to the town instead. Washington politicians were angered at McClellan&#x27;s choice to delay an attack. McClellan, however, requested reinforcements for his siege—the 11,000 men in Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin&#x27;s division, of Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell&#x27;s corps. Stanton wanted Maj. Gen. McDowell&#x27;s corps to stay together and march on to Richmond, but McClellan persisted, and Stanton eventually capitulated.

McClellan&#x27;s campaign lasted several months. However, after Gen. Robert E. Lee became the commander of local Confederate forces on June 1, he launched a series of offensives against the Army of the Potomac, which, by late June 1862, was just a few miles from the Confederate capital, Richmond. In addition, Stanton ordered McClellan to transfer one of his corps east to defend Washington. McClellan and the Army of the Potomac were pushed back to Harrison&#x27;s Landing in Virginia, where they were protected by Union gunboats. In Washington, Stanton was blamed for McClellan&#x27;s defeat by the press and the public. On April 3 Stanton had suspended military recruiting efforts under the mistaken impression that McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula Campaign would end the war. With McClellan retreating and the casualties from the campaign piling up, the need for more men rose significantly. Stanton restored recruiting operations on July 6, when McClellan&#x27;s defeat on the Peninsula was firmly established, but the damage was done. The press, angered by Stanton&#x27;s strict measures regarding journalistic correspondence, unleashed torrents of scorn on him, furthering the narrative that he was the only encumbrance to McClellan&#x27;s victory.

The attacks hurt Stanton, and he considered resigning, but he remained in his position, at Lincoln&#x27;s request. As defeats piled up, Lincoln sought to give some order to the disparate divisions of Union forces in Virginia. He decided to consolidate the commands of Maj. Gens. McDowell, John C. Frémont, and Nathaniel P. Banks into the Army of Virginia, which was to be commanded by Maj. Gen. John Pope who was brought east after success in the West. Lincoln was also convinced that the North&#x27;s army needed reformation at the highest ranks; he and Stanton being the &quot;de facto&quot; commanders of Union forces had proved too much to bear, so Lincoln would need a skilled commander. He chose Gen. Henry W. Halleck. Halleck arrived in Washington on July 22, and was confirmed as the general-in-chief of Union forces the following day.
===War rages on===

In the final days of August 1862, Gen. Lee scourged Union forces, routing them at Manassas Junction in the Second Battle of Bull Run, this time, against Maj. Gen. Pope and his Army of Virginia. A number of people, including Maj. Gen. Halleck and Secretary Stanton, thought Lee would turn his attention to Washington. Instead, Lee began the Maryland Campaign. The campaign started with a skirmish at Mile Hill on September 4, followed by a major confrontation at Harpers Ferry. Lincoln, without consulting Stanton, perhaps knowing Stanton would object, merged Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia into McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac. With 90,000 men, McClellan launched his army into the bloody Battle of Antietam, and emerged victorious, pushing the Army of Northern Virginia back into Virginia, and effectively ending Lee&#x27;s Maryland offensive. McClellan&#x27;s success at Antietam Creek emboldened him to demand that Lincoln and his government cease obstructing his plans, Halleck and Stanton be removed, and he be made general-in-chief of the Union Army. Meanwhile, he refused to move aggressively against Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia, which was withdrawing towards Richmond. McClellan&#x27;s unreasonable requests continued, as did his indolence, and Lincoln&#x27;s patience with him soon grew thin. Lincoln dismissed him from leadership of the Army of the Potomac on November 5. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside replaced McClellan days later.

Burnside, at Halleck&#x27;s request, submitted a plan to create a ruse at Culpeper and Gordonsville, while the brunt of his force took Fredericksburg, then moved on to Richmond. Halleck&#x27;s response was sent on November 14: &quot;The President has just assented to your plan. He thinks that it will succeed, if you move rapidly; otherwise not.&quot; The following Battle of Fredericksburg was a disaster, and the Army of the Potomac was handily defeated.

Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker replaced Burnside on January 26, 1863. Stanton did not much care for Hooker, who had loudly denounced Lincoln&#x27;s administration, and had been insubordinate while serving under Burnside. He would have preferred for Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans to head the army; Lincoln disregarded Stanton&#x27;s opinion. As Thomas and Hyman tell it, Lincoln &quot;chose Hooker because that general had a reputation as a fighter and stood higher in popular esteem at that moment than any other eastern general.&quot; Hooker spent considerable time strengthening the Army of the Potomac, especially regarding morale. Hooker&#x27;s only major engagement with Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia was the Battle of Chancellorsville in early May 1863. Lee had Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson engage Hooker&#x27;s rearguard in a precipitous flanking maneuver. Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s maneuver was skilfully employed, resulting a Confederate victory when the fighting ended on May 6, leaving 17,000 Union casualties.

Stanton&#x27;s attempts to raise Northern spirits after the defeat were hampered by news that, under Hooker, the Army of the Potomac had become grossly undisciplined. Indeed, Hooker&#x27;s headquarters were described as &quot;combination of barroom and brothel.&quot; Stanton petitioned for liquor and women to be forbidden in Hooker&#x27;s camps. Meanwhile, Lee was again pushing into the North. Lee&#x27;s movements were wracking nerves in Washington by mid-June, more so when disturbing reports came from Hooker&#x27;s subordinates, such as that of Brig. Gen. Marsena Patrick: &quot;[Hooker] acts like a man without a plan, &amp; is entirely at a loss what to do, or how to match the enemy, or counteract his movements.&quot; Furthermore, like McClellan, Hooker kept overestimating Lee&#x27;s numbers, and said the Lincoln&#x27;s administration did not have full confidence in him. Hooker resigned on June 27; Stanton and Lincoln decided that his replacement would be Maj. Gen. George Meade, who was appointed the following day.

Lee and Meade first clashed in the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1. News of a victory at Gettysburg, and a great Confederate retreat, came on July 4. Soon after, word came of Maj. Gen. Grant&#x27;s victory at Vicksburg. Northerners were exultant. Stanton even gave a rare speech to a huge crowd outside of the War Department&#x27;s headquarters. The administration&#x27;s celebrations soon ended, however, when Maj. Gen. Meade refused to launch an attack against Lee while the Army of Northern Virginia was stuck on the banks of the Potomac River. When Lee crossed the river untouched on July 14, Lincoln and Stanton were upset. Stanton affirmed in a letter to a friend that Meade would have his support unreservedly, but that &quot;since the world began no man ever missed so great an opportunity of serving his country as was lost by his neglecting to strike his adversary.&quot; Stanton knew, though, that Meade&#x27;s reluctance came at the advice of his corps commanders, who formerly outranked him.

While action in the Eastern Theater wound down, action in the West heated up. After the two-day Battle of Chickamauga in late September, Maj. Gen. Rosecrans, the commander of the Army of the Cumberland, was left trapped in Chattanooga, Tennessee and beset on all sides by Gen. Braxton Bragg&#x27;s forces. Rosecrans telegraphed Washington: &quot;We have met a serious disaster, extent not yet ascertained.&quot; The situation in Chattanooga was desperate. The North needed the town in its hands. According to journalist Charles Anderson Dana, who had been Stanton&#x27;s assistant secretary since March 1863, Rosecrans might only be able to fight for another 15–20 more days and that, without at least 20,000 to 25,000 more men, Chattanooga would be lost. Stanton organized the secret transportation of thousands of Union troops west by rail. Lincoln and Stanton agreed to make Maj. Gen. Grant the commander of almost all forces in the West, giving Grant the option to dismiss Rosecrans from command of the Army of the Cumberland and replace him with Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas. This Grant did. In late November, Grant, with good efforts from Thomas and Hooker, broke Gen. Bragg&#x27;s siege at Chattanooga, while Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman failed to achieve his stated objective. Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet attempted to besiege Maj. Gen. Burnside&#x27;s army at Knoxville, but Sherman moved east from Chattanooga, causing the Confederates to retreat.

===End of the war===
Grant, having been promoted to the rank of lieutenant general and made the general-in-chief of the Union Army, crossed the Rapidan River on May 4, 1864. The following day, his and Lee&#x27;s armies clashed in the Battle of the Wilderness. The result was inconclusive, but Grant, unlike previous commanders, was loath to stop his onward push; &quot;there will be no turning back,&quot; he told Lincoln. Grant again engaged Lee at Spotsylvania Court House, and again Union losses far exceeded those of the Confederates. Several days later, Grant and Lee battled at Cold Harbor, where Grant launched numerous assaults in an open field, incurring heavy losses. Nevertheless, Grant pushed on, secretly moving his army across the James River in a masterful display of engineering, but failed to take Petersburg, the important rail junction south of Richmond. The Union army was forced to forego further attacks and began entrenching; so began the Siege of Petersburg. &quot;Long lines of parallel entrenchments curled south and east of Richmond as both armies dug in,&quot; say Thomas and Hyman. &quot;Grant stabbed at Lee&#x27;s fortifications, always keeping the pressure on, and at the same time probed westward, feeling for the railroads that brought Lee&#x27;s supplies.&quot;

In the 1864 presidential election, Lincoln and his new Vice President, Andrew Johnson, emerged victorious against their Democratic opponents, George B. McClellan and George H. Pendleton. Republicans also won major congressional and gubernatorial victories in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and New York. Stanton played no small part in securing the victory. Several days prior to the election, he ordered soldiers from key states such as Illinois, Lincoln&#x27;s home state, to be returned home to vote. &quot;The men who were doing the fighting had voted for more of it in order to make their efforts worth while,&quot; Thomas and Hyman state. Stanton also used his powers at the War Department to ensure that Republican voters were not harassed or threatened at the polls. Thomas and Hyman credit Stanton&#x27;s troop furlough and other moves for much of the Republican success in the 1864 elections.

On March 3, 1865, the day before Lincoln&#x27;s second inauguration, Grant wired to Washington that Lee had sent representatives to him to sue for peace. Lincoln initially told Grant that he should get peace with the South by any means necessary. Stanton declared, however, that it is the president&#x27;s duty to sue for peace; otherwise, the president is useless and little more than a figure-head. This engendered an immediate change of tone from the president. Stanton, at Lincoln&#x27;s urging, told Grant that he was to &quot;have no conference with General Lee unless it be for the capitulation of Gen. Lee&#x27;s army, or on some minor, and purely, military matter&quot;. Further, Grant was not to &quot;decide, discuss, or confer upon any political questions. Such matters the President holds in his own hands; and will submit them to no military conferences or conventions&quot;. Grant agreed. Days later, Lincoln visited Grant at his siege headquarters (the Siege of Petersburg was still ongoing). Once Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan had rejoined his army from the Shenandoah Valley, Grant prepared to make his final push into Richmond. On April 1, 1865, Sheridan defeated Lee&#x27;s army in the Battle of Five Forks, forcing a retreat from Petersburg. Stanton, who had stayed close to his telegraph for days, told his wife the following evening: &quot;Petersburg is evacuated and probably Richmond. Put out your flags.&quot; Stanton was worried that President Lincoln, who had stayed around to watch Grant&#x27;s push into Richmond, was in danger of being captured, and warned him. Lincoln disagreed, but was happy for Stanton&#x27;s concern. The President wrote Stanton: &quot;It is certain now that Richmond is in our hands, and I think I will go there to-morrow.&quot;

News of Richmond&#x27;s fall, which came on April 3, touched off furious excitement throughout the North. &quot;The news spread fast, and people streaming from stores and offices speedily filled the thoroughfares. Cannons began firing, whistles tooted, horns blew, horsecars were forced to a standstill, the crowd yelled and cheered,&quot; say Thomas and Hyman. Stanton was overjoyed. At his bidding, candles were put in the windows of each of the Department&#x27;s properties, while bands played &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; Furthermore, the department&#x27;s headquarters were adorned with American flags, along with an image of a bald eagle holding in its talons a scroll with &quot;Richmond&quot; written on it. The night Richmond fell, Stanton tearily gave an impromptu speech to the crowd outside the War Department.

Lee and his army had slipped out of Richmond before its fall, though. Grant marched west to stymie Lee&#x27;s retreat, while Lincoln remained in Richmond. News of Grant&#x27;s victories over the withdrawing Confederates lit up Washington&#x27;s telegraphs. The Union Army was pressing on Lee&#x27;s tail, and capturing thousands of Confederate prisoners of war. On April 9 Lee finally surrendered, ending the war. On April 13, Stanton suspended conscription and recruiting, as well as the army&#x27;s acquisition efforts.

===Lincoln assassinated===

On April 14, Lincoln invited Stanton, Grant and their wives to join him at Ford&#x27;s Theatre the next evening. Lincoln had invited Stanton to go with him to the theatre several times, invitations Stanton routinely rejected. Further, neither Stanton&#x27;s nor Grant&#x27;s wives would go unless the other went. The Grants used a visit to their children in New Jersey as their excuse. Finally, Lincoln decided to go to the theatre with Major Henry Rathbone and his betrothed. Stanton retired home that night after visiting a bedridden Secretary Seward. He went to bed at about 10 pm. Soon after, he heard Ellen yell from downstairs: &quot;Mr. Seward is murdered!&quot; Stanton rushed downstairs. Upon hearing that Lincoln, too, might be dead, Stanton grew intensely animated. He wanted to leave immediately. He was cautioned: &quot;You mustn&#x27;t go out ... As I came up to the house I saw a man behind the tree-box, but he ran away, and I did not follow him.&quot; Stanton paid little mind to the man; he found a taxi and went to Seward&#x27;s home.

At his arrival, Stanton was told that Lincoln had in fact been attacked. Stanton ordered that the homes of all members of the cabinet and the Vice President be put under guard. Stanton pushed through a crowd at the Secretary&#x27;s home to find an unconscious Seward being attended to by a doctor in a bloody third-floor room. Seward&#x27;s son, Frederick, was left paralyzed by the attack. Stanton and Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, who had come to Seward&#x27;s home moments before, decided to go to Ford&#x27;s Theatre to see the President. The two secretaries went by carriage, accompanied by Quartermaster General Meigs and David K. Cartter, a justice of the District Court for the District of Columbia.
Stanton found Lincoln at the Petersen House across from the theatre. Lincoln lay on a bed diagonally, because of his height. When he saw the dying President, several accounts say Stanton began to weep. However, William Marvel states in his book, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Autocrat: The Life of Edwin Stanton&quot; that &quot;Stanton&#x27;s emotional detachment and his domineering persona made him valuable that night, as others wallowed in anguish&quot;. Thomas and Hyman also state: &quot;Always before, death close at hand had unsettled him close to the point of imbalance. Now he seemed calm, grim, decisive, in complete outward control of himself&quot;. Andrew Johnson, about whom Stanton, and the country, knew little, was sworn in as president at 11 am on April 15, in the Kirkwood Hotel. However, Stanton, who had planned to retire at the end of the war, &quot;was indeed in virtual control of the government&quot;, say Thomas and Hyman. &quot;He had charge of the Army, Johnson was barely sworn in and vastly unsure of himself, and Congress was not in session.&quot;

Stanton ordered testimony taken from those who saw the attack. Witnesses blamed actor John Wilkes Booth for the assassination. Stanton put all soldiers in Washington on guard, and ordered a lockdown of the city. Rail traffic to the south was to be halted, and fishing boats on the Potomac were not to come ashore. Stanton also called Grant back to the capital from New Jersey.

On April 15, Washington was, as journalist George A. Townsend said, &quot;full of Detective Police&quot;. At Stanton&#x27;s request, the New York Police Department joined the War Department&#x27;s detectives&#x27; tireless search for Booth and any accomplices. Stanton had the lower deck of the monitor USS &quot;Montauk&quot;, which was placed near the Washington Navy Yard, host several of the conspirators, Lewis Powell, Michael O&#x27;Laughlen, Edmund Spangler, and George Atzerodt. The other plotters, except Booth and Mary Surratt, were confined aboard the USS &quot;Saugus&quot;. The prisoners on both boats were bound by ball and chain, with handcuffs attached to an iron rod. Stanton also ordered a bag placed over the captives&#x27; heads, with a hole in it to allow for eating and breathing. Surratt was kept at Old Capitol Prison, where she had been since her arrest. Booth, the remaining culprit, had been shot at a barn in Virginia by Boston Corbett and died soon after. Booth&#x27;s body was put aboard the &quot;Montauk&quot;. After an autopsy was performed, and Booth&#x27;s identity confirmed beyond any doubt, he was buried in a &quot;secret, unmarked, and unhallowed grave&quot;, on Stanton&#x27;s orders. Stanton knew Booth would be lionized in the South, and thought he would not give anyone the opportunity. The conspirators went on to be tried and convicted. All but three were hanged.

==Johnson administration (1865–1868)==

===Sherman&#x27;s truce===

Lt. Gen. Grant, failing to find Stanton at the War Department, sent a note to his home by courier on the evening of April 21. The matter was urgent. Maj. Gen. Sherman, who had established his army headquarters in Raleigh, North Carolina, had negotiated a peace deal with Confederate commander Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, with the grace of Confederate States Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge. Sherman had been authorized to negotiate with the Southerners only in matters regarding the military, as Grant had been with Lee. Sherman explicitly acknowledged that his negotiations with Confederate leaders were to stay firmly in the realm of military policy, but flouted the limitations anyway. Sherman&#x27;s deal contained, as expected, a termination of hostilities with the South, but also specified that Southern governments who had rebelled against the United States were to be recognized by the federal government once they swore allegiance to the United States. Further, the deal&#x27;s terms provided for federal courts to be reinstated in rebellious states, as well as the restoration of property and voting rights to Southerners, and a blanket pardon for Southerners who had rebelled. The deal went even further, allowing Southern troops to place their weapons in the hands of their states&#x27; governments, which would effectively rearm the Southern states. Sherman&#x27;s truce also allotted power to the Supreme Court to resolve jurisdictional disputes between state and local governments in the South, which was a political issue, and not a legal issue, making that a power the court did not constitutionally have.

The courier arrived at Stanton&#x27;s residence breathless, interrupting his dinner. When he heard the news, Stanton, &quot;in a state of high excitement&quot;, rushed to the War Department. He sent for all members of the cabinet in the name of the President. Johnson&#x27;s cabinet, along with Grant and Preston King, Johnson&#x27;s advisor, convened at 8 pm that night. Word of Sherman&#x27;s actions was met with unanimous condemnation by those present. President Johnson instructed Stanton to tell Sherman his deal had been rejected, and that &quot;hostilities should be immediately resumed after giving the Confederates the forty-eight hours&#x27; notice required to terminate the truce&quot;. Grant would go to Raleigh at once to inform Sherman of Stanton&#x27;s edict, as well as to assume command of troops in the South.

Stanton took the matter to the press. In addition to publicizing the details of Sherman&#x27;s deal, Stanton said Sherman intentionally flouted direct orders from both Lincoln and Johnson, and listed nine reasons Sherman&#x27;s deal had been categorically rejected. Further, Stanton accused Sherman of recklessly opening a path by which Jefferson Davis might flee the country with specie Davis purportedly took with him after abandoning Richmond. The latter claim was based in Sherman&#x27;s removal of Maj. Gen. George Stoneman&#x27;s forces from the Greensboro railway—Greensboro was the place to which Davis and other Confederate officials fled. Stanton&#x27;s words were damning. &quot;It amounted to a castigation of Sherman and virtually accused him of disloyalty&quot;, say Thomas and Hyman. Moreover, Sherman being among the most respected generals in the country, Stanton&#x27;s publication endangered his place in the administration.

Having not seen Stanton&#x27;s dispatch to the press, Sherman wrote Stanton a conciliatory letter, calling his agreement &quot;folly&quot; and saying that, though he still felt his deal with Johnston and Breckinridge was solid, it was not his place to contest his superior&#x27;s decision and that he would follow orders. Meantime, Maj. Gen. Halleck, at Grant&#x27;s request, communicated to several of Sherman&#x27;s subordinates that they were to move their forces to North Carolina, regardless of what Sherman said. Halleck sent another dispatch to Sherman&#x27;s generals telling them not to listen to Sherman&#x27;s edicts at all. After Halleck&#x27;s order, and reading Stanton&#x27;s message to the press in a newspaper, Sherman&#x27;s fury reached a dizzying, explosive tenor. Sherman thought Stanton had unjustifiably characterized him as a disloyal pariah. &quot;I respect [Stanton&#x27;s] office but I cannot him personally, till he undoes the injustice of the past&quot;, Sherman said to Grant. Sherman&#x27;s brother, Senator John Sherman, wanted the general censured for his actions, but still treated fairly. Sherman himself, and his wife&#x27;s powerful family, the Ewings, wanted Stanton to publicly take back his statements. Stanton characteristically refused.

In late May, there would be a Grand Review of the Armies, where the Union Army would parade through the streets of Washington. Halleck offered the hospitality of his home to Sherman; the general bluntly refused. He informed Grant of his rejection, stating as well that he would only listen to orders from Stanton if they were explicitly sanctioned by the President as well. Sherman further stated that &quot;retraction or pusillanimous excusing&quot; would no longer cut it. The only thing acceptable to Sherman would be for Stanton to declare himself a &quot;common libeller&quot;. &quot;I will treat Mr. Stanton with like scorn &amp; contempt, unless you have reasons otherwise, for I regard my military career as ended, save and except so far as necessary to put my army into your hands.&quot;

Sherman made good on his promise. At the Grand Review, Sherman saluted the President and Grant, but slighted the secretary of war by walking past him without a handshake, in full view of the public. Stanton gave no immediate response. Journalist Noah Brooks wrote &quot;Stanton&#x27;s face, never very expressive, remained immobile&quot;. The affront touched off speculation that Stanton was about to resign. Stanton, too, considered leaving his post, but at the request of the President and numerous others, including people in the military, he kept on. In reparative efforts, Sherman&#x27;s wife brought the Stantons flowers, and spent time at their home, but Sherman continued to harbor resentment toward Stanton.

===Reconstruction===

The war was done, and Stanton now bore the substantial task of reshaping the American military establishment such that it would be as capable an apparatus in peacetime as it had proven to be in wartime. To this end, in the North, Stanton reorganized the army into two sections; one to handle &quot;training and ceremonial chores&quot;, and another to quell the American Indians in the west, who were agitated and blusterous as a result of the war. In the South, a high priority was mending the power vacuum left in Southern states after the rebellion. Stanton presented his military occupation proposal, which had been endorsed by Lincoln, to the President: two military governments would be established in Virginia and North Carolina, with provost marshals to enforce laws and establish order, tasks the marshals had proven most capable of in the weeks after the end of the war.

President Johnson had promised to his Cabinet in their first meeting on April 15 that he would uphold his predecessor&#x27;s plans for Reconstruction, plans that the deceased President had discussed at length with Stanton. On May 29, 1865, Johnson issued two proclamations; one appointed William Woods Holden as the interim governor of North Carolina, and another pardoned individuals involved in the rebellion, with a few exceptions, if they agreed to loyalty and acceptance of all laws and edicts regarding slavery. Johnson also recognized Francis Harrison Pierpont&#x27;s government in Virginia, as well as the governments in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee, which were formed under Lincoln&#x27;s ten percent plan. Further, Johnson offered the ten percent plan to several other Southern states.

In his 1865 message to Congress, the Democratic Johnson contended that the only necessary proof of loyalty a state needed to show was ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. Republicans in Congress disagreed; Senator Charles Sumner and Representative Thaddeus Stevens thought black suffrage was vitally necessary to the nation&#x27;s security and the continuing dominance of the Republican Party. Republicans used parliamentary procedures to ensure none of the Southern delegates, who were mostly former Confederate leaders, took a seat in Congress, and established a predominantly Republican joint committee to decide Reconstruction matters.

Concerning Reconstruction, the President and Congress were deeply divided. Johnson, even when his amnesty policy had come under heavy criticism, had obdurately supported and continued it. Republicans in Congress, however, came to prefer Stanton&#x27;s military occupation proposal. The President&#x27;s support from moderate Republicans dwindled after the gruesome anti-Negro riots in Memphis and New Orleans. The public seemed to be against Johnson as well. In the 1866 congressional elections, Republicans made sweeping gains on their Democratic rivals. In both the House and Senate elections, Republicans gained a two-thirds plurality of the seats. In the new year, some Republicans sought to use their majority to oust Johnson. They presented the Tenure of Office Bill, written with Stanton in mind. The President had long considered dismissing Stanton and replacing him with Maj. Gen. Sherman; the Tenure of Office Bill would have made this illegal without the advice and consent of Congress, which was unlikely to be given for Stanton, who was firmly supported by and cooperating with Republicans. When the bill reached the President&#x27;s desk, he vetoed it. His veto was overridden the same day.

With the protection offered by the Tenure of Office Act, Stanton&#x27;s opposition to Johnson became more open. In the following months, Johnson grew increasingly exasperated with his War Secretary. Johnson told Grant he intended to remove Stanton, and give him the War Secretaryship. Grant opposed the idea. He argued for Stanton&#x27;s retention and stated that the Tenure of Office Act protected Stanton. Further, Grant said, should the tenure law prove impotent, public opinion would turn further against the administration. Seward, who still respected Stanton greatly, also disagreed with his removal. The two men&#x27;s words made Johnson teeter in uncertainty; however, his will was stiffened with the support from Secretary Welles and Salmon Chase, now the Supreme Court&#x27;s Chief Justice — the former previously described Stanton as &quot;selfish, insincere, a dissembler, and treacherous&quot;, and the latter having dissolved his friendship with Stanton in aid of his political aspirations. On August 12, 1867, Johnson sent a note to Stanton saying that he was suspended from his position as Secretary of War, and was to turn over the department&#x27;s files and power to Grant. Pursuant to the Tenure of Office Act, he also notified the Senate for its consideration. Stanton grudgingly, but with little resistance, complied.

===Impeachment===


On January 13, 1868, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to reinstate Stanton as Secretary of War. Grant, fearing the Act&#x27;s prescribed penalty of $10,000 in fines and five-years of prison, doubly so because of his high likelihood of being the Republican presidential nominee in the upcoming election, turned the office over immediately. Stanton returned to the War Department soon after in &quot;unusually fine spirits and chatting casually&quot;, as newspapers reported. His reemergence precipitated a tide of congratulatory writings and gestures, thanking him for his opposition to the greatly disliked Johnson. The President, meanwhile, again began searching for an agreeable person to take the helm at the War Department, but after a few weeks, he seemed to accept Stanton&#x27;s reinstatement with resignation. He did try to diminish the power of Stanton&#x27;s office, however, regularly disregarding it. However, with his ability to sign treasury warrants, and his backing by Congress, Stanton still held considerable power.

Johnson became singularly focused on enacting Stanton&#x27;s downfall. &quot;No longer able to bear the congressional insult of an enemy imposed on his Official family,&quot; Marvel says, &quot;Johnson began to ponder removing Stanton outright and replacing him with someone palatable enough to win Senate approval.&quot; Johnson sought Lorenzo Thomas, the army&#x27;s adjutant general, to replace Stanton, to which he agreed. On February 21, Johnson notified Congress that he was dismissing Stanton, and appointing Thomas as secretary &quot;ad interim&quot;. Stanton, urged by Republican senators, refused to concede his post. That night, Republicans in the Senate, over Democratic resistance, pushed through a resolution declaring Stanton&#x27;s removal illegal. In the House, a motion was presented to impeach Johnson. On February 24 the motion was agreed to, and Johnson impeached, with a party-line 126 yeas and 47 nays.

Johnson&#x27;s trial began in late March. With a predominantly Republican Senate, Johnson&#x27;s conviction seemed to many a foregone conclusion. However, throughout the process, several senators began showing hesitance to remove the President from office. Stanton, meanwhile, had remained barricaded in the War Department&#x27;s headquarters for weeks, sneaking off once in a while to visit his home. When it seemed to Stanton that Johnson would not remove him forcefully from office, he began spending more time at home. Stanton watched closely as the trial, which he was convinced would end with Johnson&#x27;s conviction, continued for several months. When it came time to vote, 35 voted to convict, 19 to acquit, falling one short of the 36-vote supermajority needed for a conviction. The remaining proceedings were delayed for several days for the Republican National Convention. On May 26, after Johnson had been acquitted on all of the 10 other charges, Stanton submitted his resignation to the President.

==Later years and death==

===Campaigning in 1868===
After Johnson&#x27;s acquittal and Stanton&#x27;s resignation, Johnson&#x27;s administration seized upon the narrative that those who wanted his impeachment were black-hearted, especially Stanton. However, Stanton left office with strong public and Republican support. In other matters, however, Stanton was in peril. His health was in a dire state, the product of his relentless efforts during and after the war, and his finances were greatly lacking. After his resignation, Stanton possessed only the remnants of his salary, and a $500 loan. Stanton rejected calls from his fellow Republicans that he run for the Senate, choosing instead to resume his law practice.

Stanton&#x27;s law efforts stalled when he was called on in August 1868 by Robert C. Schenck, the Republican candidate for one of Ohio&#x27;s seats in the House of Representatives. Schenck&#x27;s rival, Democrat Clement Vallandigham, was well known among Republicans for his Copperhead politics, and disliked by Stanton. Believing that Democratic victory at any level would imperil the results of the war, and nullify Republican efforts during the war, Stanton went on a tour of Ohio to campaign for Schenck, other Ohio Republicans and Grant, the Republican presidential nominee. Meanwhile, Stanton&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate. His physician warned him against making lengthy speeches as his asthma irritated him severely. Stanton&#x27;s illness precipitated his return to Washington in early November. His feeble state was replaced by excitement when Republicans were victorious in the Schenck–Vallandingham race, and the presidential election.

===Illness worsens===
Afterwards, Stanton took to arguing a case in the Pennsylvania federal court involving disputed West Virginia lands, which were valued in the millions of dollars because of their coal and timber. By this time, Stanton&#x27;s illness was painfully visible. He grew so sickly that papers related to the case had to be delivered to him at his home. The court ruled against Stanton&#x27;s client, but Stanton won an appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court to have the case remanded back to the lower court. At Christmas time, Stanton was not able to travel down the stairway of his house, so the family celebrated in his room.

Many speculated at the time that Grant, who had largely ignored Stanton for several months, was due to reward him for his campaigning efforts. Stanton stated, however, that should a position in Grant&#x27;s administration be offered, he would reject it. Ohio congressman Samuel Shellabarger wrote: &quot;[Stanton] says he has not a great while to live &amp; must devote that to his family...&quot; Early in the new year, Stanton was preparing provisions for his death. However, when spring arrived, Stanton&#x27;s condition improved. When the rejuvenated Stanton appeared at a congressional enquiry, talks of Grant rewarding Stanton resumed. Several thought Stanton a good fit for the esteemed role of ambassador to England; instead, Grant offered Stanton the United States diplomatic mission to Mexico, which he declined.

=== Supreme Court nomination ===
Stanton&#x27;s health varied for much of 1869. In the later half of the year, after hearing that Congress had created a new associate justice seat on the Supreme Court, Stanton decided that he would lobby Grant to name him to that position. Stanton used Grant&#x27;s close friend, Bishop Matthew Simpson, as his proxy to convince Grant of his suitability for a place on the Supreme Court. Grant bypassed Stanton, however, and nominated Attorney General Ebenezer R. Hoar for the seat on December 14, 1869. The following day, Associate Justice Robert Cooper Grier announced his resignation, with the effective date of February 1, 1870, thus creating another vacancy for Grant to fill. Petitions in support of naming Stanton to fill the vacancy on the Court were circulated in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. They were delivered to the president on December 18, 1869. Grant and Vice President Colfax went to Stanton&#x27;s home to personally extend the nomination on December 19, Stanton&#x27;s 55th birthday. Grant officially submitted the nomination to the Senate on December 20, and Stanton was confirmed that same day by a vote of 46–11. Stanton wrote a letter of acceptance to the confirmation the next day, but died before assuming office as an associate justice. He remains the only confirmed Supreme Court nominee who accepted but died before taking the prescribed oaths.

===Death and funeral===
On the night of December 23, 1869, Stanton complained of pains in his head, neck and spine. His doctor, Surgeon General Joseph Barnes, was called. As had happened on many nights before, Stanton&#x27;s asthma had made breathing difficult. Stanton&#x27;s lungs and heart felt constricted, which kept Stanton&#x27;s wife and children, as well as Barnes, by his bedside. Stanton&#x27;s condition began to improve at midnight, but then he began, as Marvin states, &quot;[gasping] so strenuously for air that someone ran for the pastor of the Church of the Epiphany, and soon after he arrived Stanton lost consciousness.&quot; Stanton died at about 3 am on December 24.

Stanton&#x27;s body was placed in a black, linen-inlaid coffin in his second-story bedroom. President Grant had wanted a state funeral, but Ellen Stanton wanted as simple an affair as could be had. Nonetheless, Grant ordered all public offices closed, and federal buildings draped in &quot;raiments of sorrow&quot;. Flags in several major cities were lowered to half-staff, and gun salutes sounded at army installations around the country. On December 27, his body was carried by artillerymen to his home&#x27;s parlor. President Grant, Vice President Schuyler Colfax, the Cabinet, the entire Supreme Court, senators, representatives, army officers and other important officials all attended Stanton&#x27;s funeral. After the eulogy, Stanton&#x27;s casket was placed atop a caisson, and drawn by four horses to Washington D.C.&#x27;s Oak Hill Cemetery at the head of a mile-long cavalcade.

Stanton was interred beside the grave of his son James Hutchinson Stanton, who had died in infancy several years earlier. An assortment of Cabinet officials, generals, justices and senators carried Stanton&#x27;s coffin to its final resting place. One of Stanton&#x27;s professors from Kenyon College performed a service at the graveyard, and a three-volley salute was issued, ending the ceremony.

==Stanton on U.S. postage==

Edwin Stanton was the second American other than a U.S. president to appear on a U.S. postage issue, the first being Benjamin Franklin, who appeared on a stamp in 1847. The only Stanton stamp was issued March 6, 1871. This was also the only stamp issued by the post office that year. The Stanton 7-cent stamp paid the single rate postage for letters sent from the U.S. to various countries in Europe.

==Legacy==
A distinctive engraved portrait of Stanton appeared on U.S. paper money in 1890 and 1891. The bills are called &quot;treasury notes&quot; or &quot;coin notes&quot; and are widely collected today. These rare notes are considered by many to be among the finest examples of detailed engraving ever to appear on banknotes. The $1 Stanton &quot;fancyback&quot; note of 1890, with an estimated 900–1,300 in existence relative to the millions printed, ranks as number 83 in the &quot;100 Greatest American Currency Notes&quot; compiled by Bowers and Sundman (2006). Stanton also appears on the fourth issue of Fractional currency, in the amount of 50 cents. Stanton Park, four blocks from the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., is named for him, as is Stanton College Preparatory School in Jacksonville, Florida.

A steam engine, built in 1862, was named the &quot;E. M. Stanton&quot; in honor of the new Secretary of War. Stanton County, Nebraska, is named for him. Stanton Middle School in Hammondsville, Ohio, is named after him. A neighborhood in Pittsburgh is named for him (Stanton Heights) as well as its main thoroughfare (Stanton Avenue). Stanton Park and Fort Stanton in Washington, D.C., were named for him, as was Edwin Stanton Elementary School in Philadelphia. Stanton Street in Trenton, New Jersey, was also named in his honor. Edwin L. Stanton Elementary School in Washington, DC was named for his son who served as the Secretary of the District of Columbia.

==In popular culture==

Stanton appears in the 1905 Thomas Dixon novel &quot;The Clansman&quot;. The book depicts Stanton&#x27;s actions between war&#x27;s end and Johnson&#x27;s impeachment, and the role he played in Reconstruction policies. This book was adapted into the film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, though Stanton does not feature prominently in the movie.

In the 1930s, a book written by Otto Eisenschiml accused Stanton of arranging the assassination of Lincoln. Although these charges remain largely unsubstantiated, Eisenschim&#x27;s book inspired considerable debate and the 1977 book and movie, &quot;The Lincoln Conspiracy&quot;.

<text>Nałęcz () is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by associated &quot;szlachta&quot; families in the Kingdom of Poland (see Kingdom of Poland (1320–1385), and Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)) and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795).

==History==

Nałęcz is a Polish coat of arms from the 12th century (like the Abdank, Leliwa, Radwan, and Bogorya coats of arms) that represented unity and harmony. It was used by the Gembiccy, Ostrorogowie, Szamotulscy, Chełmicki, Czarnkowscy, Slizewicz, Raczyńscy, Raczkowski, Dworniccy, Sadowski, Łowińscy, Grąbczewscy and other families. It is traditionally described as a silver shawl, tied, on a red background. Most versions had the shawl tied downwards; some were tied upwards. Earlier versions and some modern ones depict the shawl untied. The shawl is similar in shape to the Teutonic image of Rune Othila, the Rune of a Fatherland.

The &quot;Nałęcz&quot; arms were initially connected with Greater Poland. The &quot;Nałęcze&quot; were accused of murdering Przemysł II in 1296. They also allied with Brandenburg against Władysław I Łokietek, and after the death of Louis I of Hungary waged war against the Grzymalites, attempting to put Ziemowit III of Masovia forcibly on the throne of Poland.

The best-known Poles who bore these arms were Joseph Conrad (Korzeniowski) and Sędziwój Ostroróg.
A Nałęcz relief is on the Guard House building in Poznań.

==Blazon==
In heraldic English, the shield may be blazoned: Gules the Nałęcz shawl circled and knotted Argent.

<text>Linda Denise Blair (born January 22, 1959) is an American actress and activist. Her portrayal of Regan MacNeil in the horror film &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973) established her in popular culture and as a scream queen, earning her a Golden Globe Award, as well as an Academy Award nomination. She reprised the role in two sequels: &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Exorcist: Believer&quot; (2023).

Blair has starred in several television films, including &quot;Born Innocent&quot; (1974), &quot;Sarah T. – Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic&quot; (1975), and &quot;Stranger in Our House&quot; (1978). She has also starred in exploitation films, including &quot;Hell Night&quot; (1981), &quot;Chained Heat&quot; (1983), and &quot;Savage Streets&quot; (1984). Her role in the musical film &quot;Roller Boogie&quot; (1979) brought her a reputation as a sex symbol. Blair was the host of the Fox Family reality series &quot;Scariest Places on Earth&quot; (2000–2006) and had regular appearances on the Animal Planet series &quot;Pit Boss&quot; (2010–2012).

Blair is an activist for the animal rights movement. In 2004, she founded the Linda Blair WorldHeart Foundation, a nonprofit organization that serves to rehabilitate and adopt rescue animals.

==Early life==
Linda Denise Blair was born January 22, 1959, in St. Louis, Missouri, to James Frederick and Elinore ( Leitch) Blair. She has an older sister, Debbie, and an older brother, Jim. When Blair was two years old, her father, a Navy test pilot-turned-executive recruiter, took a job in New York City, and the family relocated to Westport, Connecticut. Her mother worked as a real-estate agent in Westport. Linda worked as a child model at age five, appearing in Sears, J.C. Penney and Macy&#x27;s catalogues, and in over 70 commercials for Welch&#x27;s grape jams and various other companies. Blair secured a contract at age six for a series of print ads in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. At the same age, she began riding horses, later becoming a trained equestrian.

==Career==
Blair started acting with a regular role on the short-lived &quot;Hidden Faces&quot; (1968–69) daytime soap opera. Her first theatrical film appearance was in &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot; (1970), followed by a bit part in the comedy &quot;The Sporting Club&quot; (1971). In 1972, Blair was selected from a field of 600 applicants for her most notable role as Regan, the possessed daughter of a famous actress, in William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973). The role earned her a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress, and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Film critic and historian Mark Clark notes that in her performance, &quot;Blair matches [adult co-star] Ellen Burstyn note-for-note.&quot; Despite the film&#x27;s critical successes, Blair received media scrutiny for her role in the film, which was deemed by some as &quot;blasphemous&quot;, and Blair has said the film had significant impact on her life and career. After the film&#x27;s premiere in December 1973, some reporters speculated about Blair&#x27;s mental state, suggesting the filming process had resulted in her having a mental breakdown, which Blair denied, and she later received anonymous death threats. To combat the rumors and media speculation surrounding her, Warner Bros. sent the then-14-year-old Blair on an international press tour in hopes of demonstrating that she was &quot;just a normal teenager&quot;.

Blair starred opposite Kim Hunter in the controversial television film &quot;Born Innocent&quot; (1974), in which she plays a runaway teenager who is sexually abused. The film was criticized by the National Organization for Women, the New York Rape Coalition, and numerous gay and lesbian rights organizations for its depiction of female-on-female sexual abuse; the Lesbian Feminist Liberation dismissed the film, stating: &quot;Men rape, women don&#x27;t,&quot; and regarded the film as &quot;propaganda against lesbians.&quot; After filming &quot;Born Innocent&quot;, Blair also had a supporting part as a teenaged kidney-transplant patient in the disaster film &quot;Airport 1975&quot; (1974), which was critically panned, but a success at the box office. A steady series of job offers led Blair to relocate to Los Angeles in 1975, where she lived with her older sister, Debbie. Between 1975 and 1978, she had lead roles in numerous television films: &quot;Sarah T. – Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic&quot; (1975), as a teenager who becomes addicted to alcohol; &quot;Sweet Hostage&quot; (1975) opposite Martin Sheen, in which she plays a kidnapping victim; and &quot;Victory at Entebbe&quot; (1976), a dramatization of a real-life hostage situation starring Anthony Hopkins and Elizabeth Taylor.

In 1977, Blair reprised her role as Regan in the &quot;Exorcist&quot; sequel, &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; (1977), garnering a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress of 1978. The film was a critical and commercial failure, however, and at the time was the most expensive film ever made by Warner Bros. Studios. After filming &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot;, Blair took a year off from acting and competed in national equestrian circuits under the pseudonym Martha McDonald. In 1978, she made a return to acting in the Wes Craven-directed television horror film &quot;Stranger in Our House&quot; (retitled &quot;Summer of Fear&quot;), based on the novel by Lois Duncan, and also with the lead role in the Canadian production &quot;Wild Horse Hank&quot;, in which she used her equestrian skills to play a college student saving wild horses from ranchers.

Blair&#x27;s career took a new turn in 1979 with her starring role in the musical drama &quot;Roller Boogie&quot;, which established her as a sex symbol. The following year, she co-starred with Dirk Benedict in &quot;Ruckus&quot;, playing a young woman who helps a maligned Vietnam veteran evade antagonistic locals in a small town. She also starred in a number of financially successful low-budget horror and exploitation films throughout much of the 1980s. She starred opposite Peter Barton and Vincent Van Patten in the slasher film &quot;Hell Night&quot; (1981), followed by roles in the women-in-prison film &quot;Chained Heat&quot; (1983), playing a teenager in a women&#x27;s prison, and the exploitation thriller &quot;Savage Streets&quot; (1984), in which she plays the lead of a female vigilante street gang who targets male rapists. In a review of &quot;Savage Streets&quot; published by &quot;TV Guide&quot;, her performance was deemed &quot;her best since &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973)... and that&#x27;s not saying much.&quot; Also in 1983, Blair posed nude in an issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. In 1985, Blair starred again in another women-in-prison feature titled &quot;Red Heat&quot;, playing a prisoner of war in West Germany. This was followed by a lead in the direct-to-video film &quot;Night Force&quot; (1985), in which Blair portrayed a woman who travels to Mexico to save her friend from terrorists.

The era of Blair&#x27;s career between 1980 and 1985 was marked by some critical backlash, with Blair earning a total of five Razzie Award nominations and being awarded two Razzies for Worst Actress. In the late 1980s, she worked in numerous low-budget horror films, including &quot;Grotesque&quot; (1988), opposite Tab Hunter, and the Italian production &quot;Witchery&quot; (1988), opposite David Hasselhoff. The following year, she starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Up Your Alley&quot; opposite Murray Langston, and the &quot;Exorcist&quot; spoof &quot;Repossessed&quot; in 1990, co-starring Leslie Nielsen. She also appeared in several Australian B-movies in the early 1990s, including &quot;Fatal Bond&quot; (1991) and &quot;Dead Sleep&quot; (1992).

In 1996, Blair reunited with director Wes Craven for a cameo role as a reporter in &quot;Scream&quot; (1996), In 1997 she starred in a Broadway revival of &quot;Grease&quot;, playing Rizzo. Also in 1997, she appeared in a documentary for Channel 4 in the United Kingdom entitled &quot;Didn&#x27;t You Used to be Satan?&quot;, which served as a biography of her life to that point and how the film &quot;The Exorcist&quot; had dominated her career and life. Blair appeared in critic Mark Kermode&#x27;s 1998 BBC documentary &quot;The Fear of God&quot; (which Kermode directed and hosted), included as a special feature on the DVD of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. In 1999, Blair appeared in an online parody of &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; titled &quot;The Blair Bitch Project&quot;.

In 2000, she was cast as a regular in the BBC television show, &quot;L.A. 7&quot;, and between 2001 and 2003, hosted Fox Family&#x27;s &quot;Scariest Places on Earth&quot;, a reality series profiling reportedly haunted locations throughout the world. Blair devotes time to a nonprofit organization she established in 2004, the Linda Blair WorldHeart Foundation, which works to rescue and rehabilitate abused, neglected, and mistreated animals and provide them with needed pet care. As an adult, she became an animal rights activist and humanitarian, working with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Feed the Children, Variety, the Children&#x27;s Charity, and other organizations, as well as advocating for teen HIV/AIDS awareness. Blair is on the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society operation’s board of advisors. In August 2005, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Blair travelled to Mississippi and saved 51 abandoned dogs. 

In 2006, she guest-starred on The CW television series &quot;Supernatural&quot;, playing the part of Detective Diana Ballard, as she aids Sam and Dean Winchester in the episode &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, which aired November 9, 2006. In 2008, she appeared at the 18th annual Malaga Fantasy and Horror Film Festival to accept a lifetime achievement award for her work in the horror genre. Blair appeared the following year in the documentary &quot;Confessions of a Teenage Vigilante,&quot; discussing her role as Brenda in &quot;Savage Streets&quot; (1984). The documentary was included as a bonus feature on the 2009 DVD release of the film.

In 2010, she appeared as herself on the cable series &quot;Pit Boss&quot; and &quot;Jury Duty.&quot; She appeared in the 2011 Rick Springfield documentary &quot;Affair of the Heart&quot;, and was a panelist in a 2011 episode of &quot;The Joy Behar Show&quot;. In late 2011, Blair appeared at the taped Governors Awards for the 84th Academy Awards ceremony, honoring makeup artist Dick Smith, who had created the iconic makeup for Blair in &quot;The Exorcist.&quot; In 2013, Blair accepted a role in the comedy web series &quot;Whoa!&quot;, and has since appeared in the 2016 feature &quot;The Green Fairy&quot;, and the films &quot;Surge of Power: Revenge of the Sequel&quot; (2016) and the upcoming &quot;Landfill&quot; (post-production).

In 2022, Blair competed in season eight of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Scarecrow&quot; which resembled a pumpkin-headed scarecrow. Before the first elimination on &quot;Fright Night&quot; could be announced, she interrupted Nick Cannon by declaring forfeit while claiming that her fellow contestants &quot;Sir Bug a Boo&quot; (who would be unmasked in the same episode to be Ray Parker Jr.) and &quot;Snowstorm&quot; (later unmasked in the following episode as Nikki Glaser) should face off. When unmasked, Blair did her praise for this show and stated that she wanted to talk about her animal charity called the Linda Blair WorldHeart Foundation Rescue and Wellness Center in light of the nation&#x27;s animal crisis and to also annoy Ken Jeong as she claims that he annoys everyone on this show.

In October 2023, Blair reprised the role of Regan MacNeil during a cameo in &quot;The Exorcist: Believer&quot;.

==Personal life==

James, who was shown the piece by a member of his retinue, returned the compliment through an intermediary. They dated for two years, and James wrote his hit song &quot;Cold Blooded&quot; about her. Speaking on their relationship in his book &quot;Glow: The Autobiography of Rick James&quot;, he said: &quot;Linda was incredible. A free spirit. A beautiful mind. A mind-blowing body. She liked getting high and getting down as much as I did. We posed topless for a photograph that showed up everywhere. We didn&#x27;t care. We were doing our own thing our own way. It was a love affair that I hoped would last. It didn&#x27;t.&quot; James revealed that he found out Blair had been pregnant by him, and had an abortion without his knowledge.

<text>Simon Cameron (March 8, 1799June 26, 1889) was an American businessman and politician who represented Pennsylvania in the United States Senate and served as United States Secretary of War under President Abraham Lincoln at the start of the American Civil War.

A native of Maytown, Pennsylvania, Cameron made a fortune in railways, canals, and banking. He was elected to the United States Senate as a member of the Democratic Party in 1845. A persistent opponent of slavery, Cameron briefly joined the Know Nothing Party before switching to the Republican Party in 1856. He won election to another term in the Senate in 1857 and provided pivotal support to Abraham Lincoln at the 1860 Republican National Convention.

Lincoln appointed Cameron as his first Secretary of War. Cameron&#x27;s wartime tenure was marked by allegations of corruption and lax management, and he was demoted to Ambassador to the Russian Empire in January 1862. Cameron made a political comeback after the Civil War, winning a third election to the Senate in 1867 and building the powerful Cameron machine, which would dominate Pennsylvania politics for the next 70 years.

==Early life and education==
Cameron was born in Maytown, Pennsylvania, on March 8, 1799, to Charles Cameron and his wife Martha Pfoutz Cameron. Charles Cameron&#x27;s father, named Simon, had emigrated from Scotland to the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, in 1766. A farmer, he continued his trade in Lancaster County and fought with the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War. On Martha Cameron&#x27;s side, Simon was the great-grandson of Hans Michel Pfoutz, one of the first Palatine Germans to emigrate to the Thirteen Colonies, and was the third of eight children born to Charles and Martha Cameron.

Charles Cameron was a tailor and tavern keeper in Maytown, but was less than successful in those occupations. In 1808, he moved from Lancaster County north to Sunbury, in Northumberland County, but within two years was living alone with his wife in Lewisburg. He died in January 1811, and his children then boarded with other families. Simon was sent to live with the family of Dr. Peter Grahl, a Jewish physician in Sunbury. The Grahls, childless, treated him like their son, and he expanded his rudimentary education in the libraries of Dr. Grahl and his neighbors. In Sunbury, he met and got to know Lorenzo da Ponte, a librettist for Mozart and other composers. In December 1813, Simon visited Philadelphia with him.

==Career==
===Pennsylvania newspapers===
Soon after his 17th birthday, Cameron apprenticed himself as a printer with Andrew Kennedy, publisher of the &quot;Sunbury and Northumberland Gazette&quot; and &quot;Republican Advertiser&quot;. In 1817, Kennedy, who had suffered financial troubles, released Cameron from his indentures, and he went to Harrisburg, where he indentured himself to James Peacock, publisher of the &quot;Pennsylvania Republican&quot;, the leading Pennsylvania newspaper outside of Philadelphia; after two years&#x27; apprenticeship, Cameron was made the newspaper&#x27;s assistant editor.

Involvement with a Harrisburg newspaper meant involvement in Pennsylvania politics; in 1842, Cameron said he had attended almost every session of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the state legislature, since 1817. He met Samuel D. Ingham, the Secretary of the Commonwealth and proprietor of the Doylestown &quot;Messenger&quot;. Following the departure of its editor, he hired Cameron as his replacement in January 1821. Cameron held this position throughout the year, but the newspaper was not profitable and merged with another local paper, ultimately costing Cameron his job.

Cameron next worked as a compositor for the &quot;Congressional Globe&quot;, a periodical that reported on the Congress. Although it paid little, the job was ideal for a young man interested in politics, allowing him to build contacts with national political figures, including U.S. President James Monroe and U.S. Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.

In 1822, Cameron returned to Harrisburg as a partner in the &quot;Pennsylvania Intelligencer&quot;. He then purchased the &quot;Republican&quot;, and merged it with the &quot;Intelligencer&quot;. These enterprises gave Cameron enough security that he felt he could marry; on October 16, 1822, he married Margaret Brua, with whom he had ten children, six of whom reached adulthood.

===Political involvement===
In 1823, Cameron&#x27;s friend John Andrew Shulze was elected Pennsylvania governor, and Cameron spent several years in the profitable post of State Printer. In 1829, Shulze appointed him Adjutant-General of Pennsylvania. His brief term in this position gained him the rank, which he used as a title throughout his life, of general. With his appointment to that position, Cameron, who had sold his stake in the &quot;Intelligencer&quot; and brought one in the &quot;Pennsylvania Reporter and Democratic Herald&quot;, divested himself of his interest in the printing trade and ceased to be an active journalist, though he ensured his state contracts would be transferred to his brother James. Shulze also awarded Cameron contracts for the construction of canals in Pennsylvania.

A delegate from Dauphin County to the Harrisburg State Convention of the Democratic-Republicans in 1824, Cameron was slow to support the presidential candidacy of General Andrew Jackson in the 1824 election, despite Jackson&#x27;s broad support in Pennsylvania, and only did so because he supported Calhoun for vice president. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams was elected, and made Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky his successor at the State Department. In that capacity, Clay was responsible for selecting three printers in each state to print the laws and resolutions of Congress, and since Cameron was not known as an ardent Jacksonian, his firm became one of the official printers. Cameron corresponded extensively with Clay, offering him political advice on Pennsylvania affairs. Adams advocated internal improvements to the nation&#x27;s transportation infrastructure, financed by high tariffs, policies Cameron supported. By the time the administration lost control of Congress in 1827, Cameron began to gravitate away from Adams and towards Jackson. In doing so, Cameron followed a new political ally, Pennsylvania Congressman James Buchanan. His support for Jackson in his successful run for the presidency in 1828 was only lukewarm.

Cameron&#x27;s support for Jackson grew in the president&#x27;s first term, though he was busy with his involvement in banking, founding the Bank of Middletown, and canal and railroad construction. Jackson found Cameron to be a useful lieutenant in Pennsylvania. The president had originally pledged to serve only one term, in changing his mind he enlisted Cameron to get the Pennsylvania legislature to pass a resolution urging him to change his mind and run again in 1832. Calhoun had broken with the administration, and Jackson convened the 1832 Democratic National Convention for the main purpose of endorsing a new running mate, Martin Van Buren of New York. Pennsylvania politicians preferred one of their own to run with Jackson, but Cameron arranged a delegation that would back Van Buren, and he was elected along with Jackson. As a reward, Cameron was appointed to the Board of Visitors of the United States Military Academy, though he held the position only briefly. By the mid-1830s, Cameron had built a national reputation in what was becoming known as the Democratic Party. 
Buchanan had left the House of Representatives after 1831, and then served as minister to Russia. When he returned, Cameron tried to get him elected to the Senate in 1833, lobbying the legislature for votes—until 1913, senators were elected by state legislatures. He was not successful, but the following year, Cameron prevailed on Jackson to give Pennsylvania&#x27;s senior senator, William Wilkins, a diplomatic post, opening a seat that Buchanan might fill. His success in getting Buchanan elected on the fourth ballot pleased both the new senator and Vice President Van Buren, and increased his influence in Washington. Nevertheless, when Cameron sought appointment by Jackson in 1835 as governor of Michigan Territory, he did not get it.

Although he was not a delegate to the 1835 Democratic National Convention, Cameron supported the nomination of Van Buren for president and Congressman Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky for vice president, and campaigned for them; both were elected. Still seeking a federal position, he asked Buchanan for help being appointed a commissioner under the 1837 treaty with the Winnebago Indians, who ceded land in exchange for payments to tribe members as well as to those who had part-Native American descent. The commissioners were to pass on claims by traders to whom recipients were said to owe money. Cameron was named as one of the two commissioners, and in August 1838, journeyed to Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin Territory. There, they adjudicated the traders&#x27; claims, and also those of people of part-Native American blood who sought compensation. Many of the latter were represented by whites, and there were allegations of abuses, both at the time and since, though documentary evidence was never presented. According to Cameron biographer Paul Kahan, &quot;the lack of evidence, coupled with the vague assertions of corruption, became a hallmark of this scandal, and it is one of the reasons why it is so hard for historians to assess who was actually telling the truth.&quot; According to another biographer, Erwin S. Bradley, &quot;briefly, Cameron&#x27;s part in the Winnebago affair may be stated as follows: he did exceed his instructions and showed poor business acumen in failing to require bond of the third parties intrusted with the certificates; but the charges ... remain unproved&quot;. The impression of corruption long clouded Cameron&#x27;s reputation, with his enemies mocking him, to his anger, as the &quot;Great Winnebago Chief&quot;.

Somewhat shunned after the Winnebago affair, Cameron continued to support Buchanan. The defeat of Van Buren for re-election in 1840 divided Pennsylvania Democrats into those who backed the former president to run again in 1844, and those who supported the administration of Governor David R. Porter. Both Cameron and Senator Buchanan joined the latter camp, and were known as &quot;Improvement Men&quot;, and supported continued public improvements, a protective tariff, and the establishment of a state bank. A supporter of Buchanan, Cameron was strongly opposed to the presidential candidacy of Van Buren in 1844, and supported those at the national convention to require a two-thirds vote to nominate, thus effectively dooming Van Buren&#x27;s candidacy, though his exact role is uncertain. Cameron was unenthusiastic about the eventual presidential nominee, former Tennessee governor James K. Polk, not liking Polk&#x27;s ambiguous position on tariffs, and worked for his election in a desultory fashion. Polk won Pennsylvania, and was elected president.

===United States Senate: First term===

Pennsylvania elected a governor in 1844, and Democrats had been divided between supporters of Henry A. P. Muhlenberg and of Francis R. Shunk. Muhlenberg got the nomination, but soon thereafter died, and Shunk was chosen as gubernatorial nominee. Shunk was elected, but former Muhlenberg supporters, including Cameron, feared they would not receive patronage. This divided the party as it prepared to elect a senator in January 1845, and when it became clear that Senator Buchanan would become Polk&#x27;s Secretary of State, a second seat would also have to be filled.

The factions remained apart as the legislature prepared to fill the seat held by Senator Daniel Sturgeon. Cameron wrote to Buchanan in December 1844, hinting at his interest in the seat, but both factions had candidates in mind. Neither had enough support to be elected by the legislature when it met in January 1845, and as a compromise, Sturgeon was re-elected.

Buchanan resigned following Polk&#x27;s inauguration in March 1845, and the legislature prepared for an election to fill the remaining four years of his term. Governor Shunk&#x27;s faction nominated George W. Woodward, as they had to fill Sturgeon&#x27;s seat, and he gained a majority in the Democratic legislative caucus, though some legislators remained away. Cameron worked to unite the minority of the Democratic Party with the Whigs and Native American Party (or Know Nothings) to gain a majority in the legislature and elect himself. Since the election and especially in his inaugural address, it had become clear that Polk did not support a protective tariff; most of the dissenting Democrats did, as did Cameron and the Whigs. Cameron also held similar views to the Whigs on internal improvements, and found them willing to support him—he hinted to the nativists that he supported increasing the residence time for immigrants to gain citizenship. To the outrage of the mainstream Democratic Party, on March 13, 1845, Cameron was elected on the fifth ballot with 66 votes (including 16 from Democrats), to 55 for Woodward, and six votes scattered.

Cameron began his first term in the Senate with little long-term support in the legislature, since he was alienated from many of the Democrats and was viewed by the Whigs as the lesser evil to Woodward, to be replaced in better times. Alleging that Cameron had gained the seat by corrupt means, the Democratic caucus sent letters to Vice President George M. Dallas (a Pennsylvanian) and also to Buchanan. The two officials, in their replies, refrained from attacking Cameron personally, though they decried the lack of party loyalty which made his election possible. Although nothing came of this, it added to a growing rift between Buchanan and Cameron.

On the day of his election, Cameron wrote to Buchanan, asking him to assure Polk that no one in the Senate would support the administration with more good will than he. Nevertheless, having been elected by uniting disaffected Democrats and the minority parties against the candidate of the Democratic caucus, he found that neither Democrats nor Whigs were willing to fully accept him as a political fellow. Immediately after being elected senator, Cameron went to Washington, where on March 15, 1845, his credentials were laid before the Senate, which was in special session, by Vice President Dallas. On March 17, he was presented to the Senate by Senator Sturgeon, and was sworn in. Three days later, the Senate adjourned until December 1845.

Polk declined to consult Cameron on Pennsylvania federal appointments, though he had been advised by his brother-in-law, James Walker, to make an ally of Cameron, especially since the administration had only a narrow majority in the Senate. Angered, Cameron struck back, defeating the nomination of Henry Horn to the lucrative position of Collector of Customs for the Port of Philadelphia, which Polk pressed repeatedly. Cameron also defeated the nomination of Woodward to the Supreme Court, the latter likely with Buchanan&#x27;s help. Polk eventually nominated another Pennsylvanian, Robert C. Grier, as a justice; Grier was confirmed, but the president never forgave Cameron.

Cameron and Polk also differed on the tariff. The Whig-backed Tariff of 1842 was protectionist in nature, rather than for the sole purpose of raising government revenue, and Polk&#x27;s administration sought to revise it through the Walker tariff (named of the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert J. Walker, an advocate of free trade). Cameron felt free to oppose it as he owed no debts to Polk and the Pennsylvania legislature had passed a resolution asking the state&#x27;s congressional delegation to oppose the legislation. He gave a lengthy speech against the tariff in July 1846 opining that it would harm Pennsylvania&#x27;s iron foundries, and opining that no native of the state could support the bill. This was a comment aimed at Vice President Dallas; nevertheless, Dallas&#x27;s tie breaking vote in favor paved the way to the bill&#x27;s enactment.

A longtime supporter of the annexation of Texas, Cameron backed the declaration of war against Mexico and the Mexican–American War, He opposed, however, the annexation of land where slavery might flourish, and supported the Wilmot Proviso (introduced by Pennsylvania Congressman David Wilmot) which would ban slavery from lands gained from Mexico. At the same time, he stated that the people of Pennsylvania had no desire to interfere with slavery in Southern states where it was legal. Cameron&#x27;s view on slavery prior to 1861 was that it should be the decision of each state or territory whether to be slave or free, but he sought to guard Pennsylvania&#x27;s interest by limiting the spread of slavery. He expected that in due course, Southern states would themselves abolish slavery.

Polk was not a candidate for re-election in 1848, and Secretary of State Buchanan sought the Democratic presidential nomination. Cameron was a delegate from Pennsylvania to the 1848 Democratic National Convention and in common with the state&#x27;s other delegates, supported Buchanan on each ballot. The nomination went to Michigan Senator Lewis Cass, and Cameron was accused of working behind the scenes to defeat Buchanan. The Whigs nominated General Zachary Taylor of Louisiana for president, with his running mate former congressman Millard Fillmore of New York. In the fall elections, the Pennsylvania Whigs carried the state for Taylor and Fillmore (who were elected), with a majority for their party in both houses of the state legislature. Cameron&#x27;s term in the Senate was up in 1849; the Whigs wanted to elect one of their own, while many Democrats still resented the manner in which he had been elected. Cameron apparently had no supporters in the Democratic caucus; he received no votes in the legislature&#x27;s balloting for senator, in which Whig James Cooper was elected.

===Post-Senate career===
Once his term in the Senate expired in March 1849, Cameron returned to Pennsylvania and devoted his time to his business enterprises. This did not mean he cloistered himself from politics; his business activities, including railroads and banking, routinely brought him into contact with politicians, and he retained his interest in public affairs. The Democrats recaptured the state legislature in 1850, and Cameron hoped to succeed Sturgeon in the election the following January, but failed to gain enough votes. Nevertheless, the new senator, Richard Brodhead, soon became a political ally of Cameron.

Cameron and Buchanan continued to grow apart, even as Buchanan prepared to seek the 1852 Democratic presidential nomination. In 1850, trying to diminish any southern support the former secretary might get, Cameron sent Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis a thirty-year-old news article showing that Buchanan had signed an anti-slavery petition. In response, Buchanan had friendly newspapers attack Cameron. The two battled at the 1851 Democratic state convention which nominated William Bigler for governor; though Bigler was elected, Buchanan blamed Cameron for the fact that the Whigs had taken control of the state senate. Pennsylvania&#x27;s delegation to the 1852 Democratic National Convention, which included Cameron, was instructed to vote for Buchanan; nevertheless, Cameron worked for the nomination of Cass and the evident dissension in his home state&#x27;s ranks hurt Buchanan&#x27;s chances. The nomination went to former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce. Once elected, Pierce declined to return Buchanan to the cabinet, and Cameron was successful in getting a number of his allies federal positions.

Pennsylvania&#x27;s next Senate election was in 1855; in the 1854 legislative elections, the Whigs won a majority, which would ordinarily make it very difficult for Cameron to regain the seat. Many members of both the Whig and Democratic Parties were Know Nothings, who sought restrictions on immigration and immigrants, but who also, in the North, opposed the spread of slavery, an issue on which Cameron might find common ground with them. In addition, being a party with few prominent leaders, it was a route to political power for Democrats who wished to avoid Buchanan&#x27;s hold on the state party, especially after the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 cost the party support in the North. Cameron worked to appeal to the Know Nothing caucus.

When the caucuses met in early 1855, Cameron was the choice of the Know Nothing caucus, but disputes about voting meant about half the caucus left and refused to be bound by the outcome. When the legislature voted on February 13, 1855, Cameron had a plurality, but not a majority. Faced with a deadlock, the legislature postponed its voting for two weeks, but when voting resumed, it remained deadlocked, and the senatorial election was postponed, effectively until the next legislature met in 1856, allowed Governor James Pollock to make a temporary appointment. When the 1856 legislature met, the Democrats had a majority, and Cameron did not attempt to win the seat, which went to Bigler.

===United States Senate: Second term===
The various factions that opposed the Democrats and the Kansas-Nebraska Act began to coalesce by 1856 into what became known as the Union Party, or Republican Party. Cameron was aligned with many of the new party&#x27;s views and also saw an opportunity to return to the Senate. He was prominent at many of the meetings that shaped the new party. He attended the 1856 Republican National Convention that nominated former California senator John C. Frémont for president. With Buchanan the Democratic nominee for president, and Pennsylvania a crucial state in the election, Cameron was considered as Frémont&#x27;s running mate, but William Dayton was chosen. Buchanan won Pennsylvania by fewer than three thousand votes, and Frémont blamed the decision not to choose Cameron as critical to the outcome. The Democrats had a narrow majority in the Pennsylvania legislature against the combined forces of the Republicans and Know Nothings.

Once the presidential election was over, Republicans considered how to obtain the Democratic votes needed to gain the senatorship. Cameron had the support of Representatives David Wilmot and Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, who were convinced Cameron could win. Cameron kept his plans as quiet as possible; unnerved by rumors and the memories of Cameron&#x27;s controversial victory in 1845, Democrats nominated John W. Forney, a journalist and loyal Democrat. Forney had gotten President-elect Buchanan to write a letter of support to show to legislators, but there were three Democratic members who disliked Buchanan and the letter helped them decide to vote for Cameron. They secretly met with Cameron&#x27;s managers, who told the Republicans and Know Nothing legislators that there would be Democratic votes, and obtained an agreement to support Cameron on the first ballot. In the election on January 13, 1857, Cameron was elected without a vote to spare, to the shock of many legislators and observers. The three Democrats were expelled from their hotels in Harrisburg, and each lost his re-election bid. Cameron was informed of his election by his son, Donald Cameron, who leapt out of a window at the rear of the legislative chamber, and raced to his father&#x27;s hotel.

The election of Cameron, given the Democratic majority in the legislature, was seen as a great victory for the Republicans, and an embarrassment for President-elect Buchanan. The Democrats alleged bribery, and the legislature formed a committee to investigate, but the majority found no evidence to substantiate any charges. Similarly, shortly after Cameron&#x27;s swearing-in, Senator Bigler presented a petition signed by 59 members of the legislature asking the Senate to investigate the circumstances of Cameron&#x27;s election, but the Senate soon dropped the matter, finding there was no proof of wrongdoing. Nevertheless, like the Winnebago matter, the circumstances of the 1857 election gave Cameron a reputation for corruption that proved impossible to shake.

Cameron quickly became one of the leaders of the Republican minority in the Senate. He returned to a Senate far less congenial than the body he had left eight years before, with members deeply divided over slavery. Nevertheless, he maintained friendships with Southern senators. The divisions manifested themselves during the Senate&#x27;s debate over whether to adopt President Buchanan&#x27;s recommendation that Kansas Territory be admitted to the Union under the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution. Cameron engaged in a verbal battle in March 1858 with Missouri&#x27;s James S. Green, during which each called the other a liar, and Green suggested the two should fight a duel. The matter was settled, as was usual in such cases, with formal apologies before the Senate. Nevertheless, remembering the recent beating of Charles Sumner, Cameron made a pact with Zachariah Chandler of Michigan and Benjamin F. Wade of Ohio that they would take each other&#x27;s part in another such incident.

Cameron&#x27;s view concerning slavery remained much as it had during his first term in the Senate. He opposed its spread, believing it to be against Pennsylvania&#x27;s interest for it to do so, but thought Congress had no power to do anything about it where it already existed. He also, beginning in about 1859, employed as a servant an escaped slave named Tom Chester. Cameron arranged for him to be educated; he later emigrated to Liberia and became that country&#x27;s minister to Russia.

Although like most Republican senators, Cameron distrusted President Buchanan, he supported the administration when the president asked for funds for troops in case there should be conflict with members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Utah Territory. Republicans feared Buchanan would use the troops to support pro-slavery elements in Kansas. Cameron was one of only four Republicans to vote in favor. In 1858, Cameron campaigned for the Republicans in Pennsylvania, who were rewarded with control of the state House of Representatives, although Democrats maintained a one-vote majority in the state Senate, Democrats previously had a majority of Pennsylvania&#x27;s seats in the federal House of Representatives; they were reduced to five out of twenty-five seats. Cameron&#x27;s influence in Harrisburg allowed him to choose the new officers of the state House, and continued victories in the 1859 state elections magnified his status in Pennsylvania.

A persistent opponent of slavery, Cameron switched to the Know Nothing Party, before joining the Republican Party in 1856.

=== Election of 1860 ===
==== Presidential nomination ====
The year 1860 was a presidential election year, and Cameron sought the nomination, believing that Pennsylvania&#x27;s strength at the nominating convention would be sufficient to win. Not all Pennsylvania Republicans supported Cameron, and there were rumors that he had made a deal with the Democrats, or that his candidacy was a stalking horse to build support for the frontrunner, New York Senator William H. Seward. This was supported by a visit Seward had paid to Harrisburg in 1859, in which he had been feted by Cameron. Afterwards, Seward had written to his political manager, Thurlow Weed, that Cameron had promised the ultimate support of the Pennsylvania delegation, though it might initially vote for Cameron. The rumors that Cameron would support Seward were damaging since the New Yorker&#x27;s abolitionist leanings limited his support among Pennsylvania&#x27;s conservative voters. Kahan suggested that the fact that Cameron hosted both Seward and another presidential hopeful, Governor Salmon P. Chase of Ohio, in 1859, meant that he was trying to keep good relations with the major contenders for the nomination and place himself in a position to be a kingmaker. There was little support for Cameron outside of Pennsylvania. One of the other contenders, former representative Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, played down suggestions Lincoln might take second place on a ticket led by Cameron, Lincoln&#x27;s supporters discussed the possibility of Cameron as vice presidential candidate, hoping it might win the crucial state of Pennsylvania.

The year also would see elections for governor of Pennsylvania, and for a legislature that would choose who would fill Senator Bigler&#x27;s seat. In February 1860, the party state convention endorsed Cameron as Pennsylvania&#x27;s favorite son candidate for the Republican nomination for president, and chose Andrew Curtin as gubernatorial candidate. There was a strong dislike between the two men, and their supporters, but no one wanted a breach within the party. Curtin had little appetite for a deal between Cameron and Seward, since if Seward headed the ticket, his unpopularity in Pennsylvania might affect Curtin&#x27;s own election.

In mid-March, Cameron told Seward that he wanted to meet with Weed in advance of the 1860 Republican National Convention in May in Chicago. Confident that Seward would gain the nomination, and of Cameron&#x27;s support, Weed did not meet with Cameron. Kahan suggested that if the two had met, Cameron would have demanded a cabinet seat for his support, something Weed wanted to avoid.

In Chicago, supporters of his rivals worked to stop a Seward victory on the first ballot, and selected Lincoln as the candidate with the most support. Although Lincoln had instructed his people to make no deals that would bind him, his manager, David Davis, reasoned that Lincoln, not present at the convention, was in no position to judge what had to be done to get him the nomination, and would have to fulfill whatever deals they made. It is unclear if an explicit deal was made to bring Cameron aboard the Lincoln bandwagon, but at the minimum, Davis and others pledged that Cameron would be treated as generously as if he had supported Lincoln from the start. William Herndon, Lincoln&#x27;s law partner, later wrote that Davis and his fellow managers &quot;negotiated with the Indiana and Pennsylvania delegations and assigned places in the cabinet to Simon Cameron and Caleb Smith, beside making other ‘arrangements’ which [Davis] expected Mr. Lincoln to ratify. Of this he [Lincoln] was undoubtedly unaware.&quot;

According to Bradley, Cameron could not have delivered the delegation to Seward had he wanted to, given the opposition to the New Yorker in the state. On the first ballot, a divided Pennsylvania delegation came together to cast 47 votes of 54 for Cameron, as Seward had a plurality, with Lincoln behind him and Cameron third. On the second ballot, Lincoln received 48 votes from Pennsylvania, as he almost erased Seward&#x27;s lead. On the third, on which Lincoln was nominated, Lincoln&#x27;s Pennsylvania vote increased to 52.

==== Campaign ====
The understanding between Lincoln&#x27;s backers and Cameron&#x27;s became public almost at once, with one newspaper printing that the senator had been promised the Treasury Department. In the campaign, Cameron was a strong supporter of Lincoln, stating that he welcomed Lincoln&#x27;s nomination &quot;in a most cordial and emphatic manner&quot;. In August, Cameron wrote to the presidential candidate, pledging that Pennsylvania would vote for him, and &quot;the state is for you and we all have faith in your good intentions to stand by her interests&quot;. Cameron also sent a contribution of $800 to Davis. To establish his soundness on the tariff question, which was important in Pennsylvania, Lincoln had Davis show Cameron excerpts from speeches he had given in the 1840s; Cameron wrote to Lincoln that he was pleased with their content. Cameron also campaigned for Curtin, though antagonism between the two continued.

On October 9, 1860, Pennsylvania state elections were held. Curtin was easily elected, and Republicans increased their margins in both houses of the legislature. This meant that Senator Bigler would almost certainly be replaced by a Republican, and if Cameron resigned to accept high office, his successor would also be a Republican. Republican Party leaders did not rest on their state laurels but pressed for a heavy majority for Lincoln. On Election Day, November 6, 1860, Republicans flipped Pennsylvania to their party, something confirmed by a telegram from Harrisburg to Lincoln&#x27;s headquarters in Springfield after midnight, &quot;Hon. A. Lincoln: Pennsylvania, 70,000 for you. New York safe, Glory enough. S. Cameron.&quot;

==Secretary of War==
===Appointment===

In drafts Lincoln made of his cabinet following the election, Cameron was omitted. Given the divisions between Cameron and Curtin supporters in Pennsylvania, Lincoln planned to exclude Cameron from the cabinet, hoping both factions would accept New Jersey&#x27;s William Dayton, like Cameron a strong protectionist. Within days, though, Lincoln began receiving many letters urging him to make Cameron Secretary of the Treasury.

Lincoln may still have been unaware of the understanding made at the convention; his advisor, Leonard Swett, wrote to Cameron on November 27, 1860, that Lincoln was not bound by any such bargain. Swett sent a copy to the president-elect, who did nothing initially, but asked Weed for his view on Cameron on December 20. Cameron had reneged on his support for Seward, Weed&#x27;s candidate, and Weed advised excluding Cameron in favor of a trustworthy Southerner. Cameron would not visit Lincoln&#x27;s hometown of Springfield, Illinois without an invitation, and, after sending Swett to Pennsylvania to confer with him, Lincoln felt compelled to invite Cameron, who arrived on December 30, 1860. Others urged Lincoln to leave Cameron out of the cabinet, citing the Winnebago affair or the allegations of bribery in his elections to the Senate; former congressman George N. Eckert wrote, &quot;I wish to say to you that under no circumstances or contingency will it answer to even dream of putting Simon Cameron in the Cabinet. He is corrupt beyond belief. He is rich by plunder—and can not be trusted any where.&quot;

Upon his arrival in Springfield, Cameron met with Lincoln for several hours, first at the president-elect&#x27;s law office and then at the senator&#x27;s hotel. Both men were personable in nature, and the meetings were enjoyable; at their conclusion, Lincoln offered Cameron a place in the cabinet, either as Secretary of the Treasury or of War. At Cameron&#x27;s request, Lincoln gave him the offer in writing, which he regretted soon thereafter, as no sooner had Cameron left town, that a fresh flood of anti-Cameron communications came to him, and he met with Alexander McClure, a member of a faction in Pennsylvania opposed to Cameron. Lincoln wrote to withdraw the offer, asking Cameron to keep it confidential, unless he chose to publicly decline, in which case he had no objection to the offer being made public. One reason for Lincoln&#x27;s about-face was that he had asked Cameron to keep the offer confidential, which he had not done. Cameron complained to Lincoln&#x27;s associates about the president-elect&#x27;s conduct, but did and said nothing publicly, and in fact arranged for Lincoln and his family to use a luxurious Pennsylvania Railroad car for the journey to Washington.

In early January, after meeting with Chase, who he wanted in the cabinet, Lincoln told two of his advisers, &quot;I am in a quandary. Pennsylvania is entitled to a cabinet office. [Lincoln had received] hundreds of letters, and the cry is &#x27;Cameron, Cameron!&#x27; ... The Pennsylvania people say: &#x27;If you leave out Cameron you disgrace him. Lincoln decided not to offer Cameron the Treasury post, but to hold out the possibility of another appointment. On January 13, Lincoln sent Cameron a letter stating he meant no offense by the previous letter, and stating that he had no doubt Cameron would perform the duties of a cabinet secretary &quot;ably and faithfully&quot;. Cameron continued to press Lincoln by displaying the December 31 letter offering a post without showing the January 3 one rescinding the offer. With much of Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet undetermined by the end of January, Herndon wrote, &quot;Lincoln is in a fix. Cameron’s appointment ... bothers him. If Lincoln do[es] appoint Cameron, he gets a fight on his hands, and if he do[es] not he gets a quarrel deep-abiding, &amp; lasting ... Poor Lincoln! God help him!&quot;

At the behest of Cameron supporters Lincoln met with, the president-elect offered another meeting in Springfield, but Cameron refused, and the matter was still unresolved when Lincoln left for Washington, D.C. When the train passed through Pittsburgh, Lincoln was met with a group of Cameron supporters who insisted he be appointed to the cabinet. In Philadelphia, other Cameron acolytes buttonholed Lincoln, both in the lobby of his hotel, and at his room. Tired of this, he hinted he might keep holdovers from the Buchanan cabinet rather than appoint Cameron.

Cameron&#x27;s opponents in Pennsylvania, likely out of fear the state would go unrepresented in the cabinet, dropped their opposition to him. When Lincoln stopped in Philadelphia, a group of supporters of Governor Curtin told him that Curtin now supported Cameron&#x27;s cabinet bid. Lincoln still made no decision until after he reached Washington, D.C., when after much soul-searching he decided to appoint Cameron to the cabinet. Cameron still wanted the Treasury position, which went to Chase, and only reluctantly accepted War. After discussions between the two on February 28 and March 1, 1861, Lincoln nominated Cameron to be Secretary of War on March 5, 1861, the day after he took office as president.

He broke with Lincoln and openly advocated emancipating the slaves and arming them for the army at a time when Lincoln was not ready to publicly take that position. Cameron&#x27;s tenure as Secretary of War was marked by allegations of corruption and lax management.

=== Tenure ===
Cameron was sworn in as Secretary of War on March 12, 1861. The week&#x27;s delay in swearing-in was because Cameron was in Pennsylvania and has been taken by some historians to mean that, even amid the rapidly-worsening secession crisis, that Cameron did not take his new position seriously. Kahan pointed out that at Lincoln&#x27;s first cabinet meeting, on March 6, there was no mention of the increasingly-desperate situation at Fort Sumter. At the cabinet meeting of March 15, Lincoln asked his cabinet members for their views on Sumter and Cameron stated that the fort, isolated in the harbor of seceded Charleston, South Carolina, should not be resupplied since it could not be held indefinitely.

On April 18, 1861, the day after Virginia seceded from the Union, the Virginia militia seized Harpers Ferry, an important work station on the rival Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s main westward line and a strategically important connection between Washington, D.C., and the American West.

Under threats of destruction or confiscation from the Governor of Virginia and mayor of nearby Charles Town, B&amp;O president John Work Garrett asked Cameron to protect the B&amp;O. Instead, Cameron warned Garrett that passage of any Confederate troops over his line would be treason. Cameron agreed to station troops to protect other rail lines, including the Pennsylvania, but flatly refused to help the B&amp;O. The B&amp;O had to repair damaged line at its own expense and often received late or no payment for services rendered to the federal government. The Harpers Ferry Bridge was blown up by order of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson on June 14.

On June 20, 1861, Jackson seized Martinsburg, another major B&amp;O work station. Within weeks, Jackson began confiscating locomotives, train cars, and track for Confederate use in Virginia. With B&amp;O&#x27;s main line into Washington inoperative for over six months, the North Central and Pennsylvania Railroads profited from overflow traffic.

These problems were partially alleviated by the summer 1861 Union victories at Philippi and Rich Mountain, and vigorous army and company work crews which reduced the main line gap to 25 miles between Harpers Ferry and Back Creek. However, with no help from Secretary Cameron, Garret appealed to others, including Reverdy Johnson, General George McClellan, and Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase.

The gap created in the B&amp;O line dramatically affected civilian life as well. The B&amp;O was forced to arrange to have its coal shipments brought to the capital via the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, but as winter began, coal prices soared in Washington. Western farmers could also not get their produce to markets because of the B&amp;O gap. Finally, Samuel M. Felton, the President of PW&amp;B Railroad notified newspapers of the War Department&#x27;s discrimination against the B&amp;O.

Cameron&#x27;s corruption became so notorious that Pennsylvania Representative Thaddeus Stevens, asked whether there was anything Cameron would not steal, said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think that he would steal a red hot stove.&quot; Cameron demanded Stevens retract this insult, and so Stevens said to Lincoln, &quot;I believe I told you he would not steal a red hot stove. I will now take that back.&quot;

In January 1862, President Lincoln removed Cameron in favor of Edwin M. Stanton, a Pennsylvania lawyer who had been serving as Cameron&#x27;s legal advisor. Furthermore, on January 31, Congress passed the Railways and Telegraph Act, creating the United States Military Railroad and allowing it to seize and operate any railroad or telegraph company&#x27;s equipment, although Stanton and USMRR Superintendent Daniel McCallum would choose to allow civilian operations to continue. In February 1862, Union forces recaptured Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry, and work crews continued replacing wrecked bridges and equipment, although bushwhacker raids continued.

After Stanton&#x27;s promotion, Cameron briefly served as Minister to Russia.

==Postwar political boss==

Cameron made a political comeback after the Civil War, building a powerful state Republican machine, which would dominate Pennsylvania politics for the next 70 years. In 1866, Cameron was again elected to the U.S. Senate.

Cameron convinced his close friend Ulysses S. Grant to appoint his son, J. Donald Cameron, as Secretary of War in 1876. Later that year, Cameron helped Rutherford B. Hayes win the Republican nomination for president. Cameron resigned from the Senate in 1877, after ensuring that his son would succeed him.

In the 1880 United States presidential election, Cameron and his son, along with Roscoe Conkling and John A. Logan, led the conservative, anti-Blaine, Stalwart faction of the Republican Party in their advocacy of nominating Grant for a third, non-consecutive presidential term. The Stalwarts were ultimately thwarted when the Blaine faction formed an alliance with the Half-Breeds to nominate James A. Garfield, who would triumph in the general election over Democratic opponent Winfield Scott Hancock.

== Personal life ==
Cameron&#x27;s brother James was a colonel in the 79th New York Volunteer Infantry, and was killed in action at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861.

==Death ==
Cameron retired to his farm at Donegal Springs near Maytown, Pennsylvania, where he died on June 26, 1889, at the age of 90. He is buried in the Harrisburg Cemetery in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Though Cameron had intended his son to succeed him as head of the state machine, Matthew Quay ultimately succeeded Cameron as the party boss.

==Legacy==
According to historian Hans L. Trefousse, Cameron ranks as one of the most successful political bosses in American history. He was shrewd, wealthy, and devoted his talents in money to the goal of building a powerful Republican organization. He achieved recognition as the undisputed arbiter of Pennsylvania politics. His assets included business acumen, sincere devotion to the interests and needs of Pennsylvania, expertise on the tariff issue and the need for protection for Pennsylvania industry, and a skill at managing and organizing politicians and their organizations. He cleverly rewarded his friends, punished his enemies, and maintain good relations with his Democratic counterparts. His reputation as an unscrupulous grafter was exaggerated by his enemies; he was in politics for power, not profit.

Biographer Paul Kahan says Cameron was very good as a &quot;back-slapping, glad-handing politician&quot;, who could manipulate congressmen. But as Secretary of War he was too disorganized, and inattentive to the extremely complex duties of the largest and most important federal department. He paid too much attention to patronage and then not enough to strategy.

Cameron County, Pennsylvania, and Cameron Parish, Louisiana, are named in his honor, as are:

*Simon Cameron House and Bank, Middletown, Pennsylvania
*Simon Cameron House, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
*Simon Cameron School, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

<text>Policy is a deliberate system of guidelines to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within an organization. Policies can assist in both &quot;subjective&quot; and &quot;objective&quot; decision making. Policies used in subjective decision-making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result, are often hard to test objectively, e.g. work–life balance policy. Moreover, governments and other institutions have policies in the form of laws, regulations, procedures, administrative actions, incentives and voluntary practices. Frequently, resource allocations mirror policy decisions.

Policy is a blueprint of the organizational activities which are repetitive and routine in nature.

In contrast, policies to assist in objective decision-making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested, e.g. password policy.

The term may apply to government, public sector organizations and groups, as well as individuals, Presidential executive orders, corporate privacy policies, and parliamentary rules of order are all examples of policy. Policy differs from rules or law. While the law can compel or prohibit behaviors (e.g. a law requiring the payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve the desired outcome.

Policy or policy study may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have. Policies can be understood as political, managerial, financial, and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals. In public corporate finance, a critical accounting policy is a policy for a firm or company or an industry that is considered to have a notably high subjective element, and that has a material impact on the financial statements.

It has been argued that policies ought to be evidence-based. An individual or organization is justified in claiming that a specific policy is evidence-based if, and only if, three conditions are met. First, the individual or organization possesses comparative evidence about the effects of the specific policy in comparison to the effects of at least one alternative policy. Second, the specific policy is supported by this evidence according to at least one of the individual&#x27;s or organization&#x27;s preferences in the given policy area. Third, the individual or organization can provide a sound account for this support by explaining the evidence and preferences that lay the foundation for the claim.

Policies are dynamic; they are not just static lists of goals or laws. Policy blueprints have to be implemented, often with unexpected results. Social policies are what happens &#x27;on the ground&#x27; when they are implemented, as well as what happens at the decision making or legislative stage.

When the term policy is used, it may also refer to:
* Official government policy (legislation or guidelines that govern how laws should be put into operation)
* Broad ideas and goals in political manifestos and pamphlets
* A company or organization&#x27;s policy on a particular topic. For example, the equal opportunity policy of a company shows that the company aims to treat all its staff equally.

The actions an organization actually takes may often vary significantly from its stated policy. This difference is sometimes caused by political compromise over policy, while in other situations it is caused by lack of policy implementation and enforcement. Implementing policy may have unexpected results, stemming from a policy whose reach extends further than the problem it was originally crafted to address. Additionally, unpredictable results may arise from selective or idiosyncratic enforcement of policy.

==Effects==

===Intended effects and policy-design===
The intended effects of a policy vary widely according to the organization and the context in which they are made. Broadly, policies are typically instituted to avoid some negative effect that has been noticed in the
organization, or to seek some positive benefit.

A meta-analysis of policy studies concluded that international treaties that aim to foster global cooperation have mostly failed to produce their intended effects in addressing global challenges, and sometimes may have led to unintended harmful or net negative effects. The study suggests enforcement mechanisms are the &quot;only modifiable treaty design choice&quot; with the potential to improve the effectiveness.

Corporate purchasing policies provide an example of how organizations attempt to avoid negative effects. Many large companies have policies that all purchases above a certain value must be performed through a purchasing process. By requiring this standard purchasing process through policy, the organization can limit waste and standardize the way purchasing is done.

The State of California provides an example of benefit-seeking policy. In recent years, the numbers of hybrid cars in California has increased dramatically, in part because of policy changes in Federal law that provided USD $1,500 in tax credits (since phased out) and enabled the use of high-occupancy vehicle lanes to drivers of hybrid vehicles. In this case, the organization (state or federal government) created an effect (increased ownership and use of hybrid vehicles) through policy (tax breaks, highway lanes).

===Unintended===
Policies frequently have side effects or unintended consequences. Because the environments that policies seek to influence or manipulate are typically complex adaptive systems (e.g. governments, societies, large companies), making a policy change can have counterintuitive results. For example, a government may make a policy decision to raise taxes, in hopes of increasing overall tax revenue. Depending on the size of the tax increase, this may have the overall effect of reducing tax revenue by causing capital flight or by creating a rate so high that citizens are deterred from earning the money that is taxed.

The policy formulation process theoretically includes an attempt to assess as many areas of potential policy impact as possible, to lessen the chances that a given policy will have unexpected or unintended consequences.

==Cycle==

In political science, the policy cycle is a tool commonly used for analyzing the development of a policy. It can also be referred to as a &quot;stages model&quot; or &quot;stages heuristic&quot;. It is thus a rule of thumb rather than the actual reality of how policy is created, but has been influential in how political scientists looked at policy in general. It was developed as a theory from Harold Lasswell&#x27;s work. It is called the policy cycle as the final stage (evaluation) often leads back to the first stage (problem definition), thus restarting the cycle.

Harold Lasswell&#x27;s popular model of the policy cycle divided the process into seven distinct stages, asking questions of both how and why public policies should be made. With the stages ranging from (1) intelligence, (2) promotion, (3) prescription, (4) invocation, (5) application, (6) termination and (7) appraisal, this process inherently attempts to combine policy implementation to formulated policy goals.

One version by James E. Anderson, in his &quot;Public Policy-Making&quot; (1974) has the following stages:
# Agenda setting (Problem identification) – The recognition of certain subject as a problem demanding further government attention.
# Policy formulation – Involves exploring a variation of options or alternative courses of action available for addressing the problem. (appraisal, dialogue, formulation, and consolidation)
# Decision-making – Government decides on an ultimate course of action, whether to perpetuate the policy status quo or alter it. (Decision could be &#x27;positive&#x27;, &#x27;negative&#x27;, or &#x27;no-action&#x27;)
# Implementation – The ultimate decision made earlier will be put into practice.
# Evaluation – Assesses the effectiveness of a public policy in terms of its perceived intentions and results. Policy actors attempt to determine whether the course of action is a success or failure by examining its impact and outcomes.
Anderson&#x27;s version of the stages model is the most common and widely recognized out of the models. However, it could also be seen as flawed. According to Paul A. Sabatier, the model has &quot;outlived its usefulness&quot; and should be replaced. The model&#x27;s issues have led to a paradoxical situation in which current research and updated versions of the model continue to rely on the framework created by Anderson. But the very concept of the stages model has been discredited, which attacks the cycle&#x27;s status as a heuristic.

Due to these problems, alternative and newer versions of the model have aimed to create a more comprehensive view of the policy cycle. An eight step policy cycle is developed in detail in &quot;The Australian Policy Handbook&quot; by Peter Bridgman and Glyn Davis: (now with Catherine Althaus in its 4th and 5th editions)

# Issue identification
# Policy analysis
# Consultation (which permeates the entire process)
# Policy instrument development
# Building coordination and coalitions
# Program Design: Decision making
# Policy Implementation
# Policy Evaluation

The Althaus, Bridgman &amp; Davis model is heuristic and iterative. It is and not meant to be or predictive. Policy cycles are typically characterized as adopting a classical approach, and tend to describe processes from the perspective of policy decision makers. Accordingly, some post-positivist academics challenge cyclical models as unresponsive and unrealistic, preferring systemic and more complex models. They consider a broader range of actors involved in the policy space that includes civil society organizations, the media, intellectuals, think tanks or policy research institutes, corporations, lobbyists, etc.

==Content==

Policies are typically promulgated through official written documents. Policy documents often come with the endorsement or signature of the executive powers within an organization to legitimize the policy and demonstrate that it is considered in force. Such documents often have standard formats that are particular to the organization issuing the policy. While such formats differ in form, policy documents usually contain certain standard components including:
* A &quot;purpose statement&quot;, outlining why the organization is issuing the policy, and what its desired effect or outcome of the policy should be.
* An &quot;applicability and scope&quot; statement, describing who the policy affects and which actions are impacted by the policy. The applicability and scope may expressly exclude certain people, organizations, or actions from the policy requirements. Applicability and scope is used to focus the policy on only the desired targets, and avoid unintended consequences where possible.
* An &quot;effective date&quot; which indicates when the policy comes into force. Retroactive policies are rare, but can be found.
* A &quot;responsibilities&quot; section, indicating which parties and organizations are responsible for carrying out individual policy statements. Many policies may require the establishment of some ongoing function or action. For example, a purchasing policy might specify that a purchasing office be created to process purchase requests, and that this office would be responsible for ongoing actions. Responsibilities often include identification of any relevant oversight and/or governance structures.
* &quot;Policy statements&quot; indicating the specific regulations, requirements, or modifications to organizational behavior that the policy is creating. Policy statements are extremely diverse depending on the organization and intent, and may take almost any form.

Some policies may contain additional sections, including:
* &quot;Background&quot;, indicating any reasons, history, ethical background statements, and/or intent that led to the creation of the policy, which may be listed as &quot;motivating factors&quot;. This information is often quite valuable when policies must be evaluated or used in ambiguous situations, just as the intent of a law can be useful to a court when deciding a case that involves that law.
* &quot;Definitions&quot;, providing clear and unambiguous definitions for terms and concepts found in the policy document.

==Types==
The American political scientist Theodore J. Lowi proposed four types of policy, namely &quot;distributive&quot;, &quot;redistributive&quot;, &quot;regulatory&quot; and &quot;constituent&quot; in his article &quot;Four Systems of Policy, Politics and Choice&quot; and in &quot;American Business, Public Policy, Case Studies and Political Theory&quot;. Policy addresses the intent of the organization, whether government, business, professional, or voluntary. Policy is intended to affect the &quot;real&quot; world, by guiding the decisions that are made. Whether they are formally written or not, most organizations have identified policies.

Policies may be classified in many different ways. The following is a sample of several different types of policies broken down by their effect on members of the organization.

===Distributive===

Distributive policies involve government allocation of resources, services, or benefits to specific groups or individuals in society. The primary characteristic of distributive policies is that they aim to provide goods or services to a targeted group without significantly reducing the availability or benefits for other groups. These policies are often designed to promote economic or social equity. Examples include subsidies for farmers, social welfare programs, and funding for public education.

===Regulatory===
Regulatory policies aim to control or regulate the behavior and practices of individuals, organizations, or industries. These policies are intended to address issues related to public safety, consumer protection, and environmental conservation. Regulatory policies involve government intervention in the form of laws, regulations, and oversight. Examples include environmental regulations, labor laws, and safety standards for food and drugs. Another example of a fairly successful public regulatory policy is that of a highway speed limit.

===Constituent===
Constituent policies are less concerned with the allocation of resources or regulation of behavior, and more focused on representing the preferences and values of the public. These policies involve addressing public concerns and issues that may not have direct economic or regulatory implications. They often reflect the broader values and beliefs of the society. Constituent policies can include symbolic gestures, such as resolutions recognizing historical events or designating official state symbols. Constituent policies also deal with fiscal policy in some circumstances.

===Redistributive===
Redistributive policies involve the transfer of resources or benefits from one group to another, typically from the wealthy or privileged to the less advantaged. These policies seek to reduce economic or social inequality by taking from those with more and providing for those with less. Progressive taxation, welfare programs, and financial assistance to low-income households are examples of redistributive policies.

==Subtypes==
== Induction of policies ==
In contemporary systems of market-oriented economics and of homogeneous voting of delegates and decisions, policy mixes are usually introduced depending on factors that include popularity in the public (influenced via media and education as well as by cultural identity), contemporary economics (such as what is beneficial or a burden in the long- and near-term within it) and a general state of international competition (often the focus of geopolitics). Broadly, considerations include political competition with other parties and social stability as well as national interests within the framework of global dynamics.

Policies or policy-elements can be designed and proposed by a multitude of actors or collaborating actor-networks in various ways. Alternative options as well as organisations and decision-makers that would be responsible for enacting these policies – or explaining their rejection – can be identified. &quot;Policy sequencing&quot; is a concept that integrates mixes of existing or hypothetical policies and arranges them in a sequential order. The use of such frameworks may make complex polycentric governance for the achievement of goals such as climate change mitigation and stoppage of deforestation more easily achievable or more effective, fair, efficient, legitimate and rapidly implemented.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1017/sus.2021.21&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary ways of policy-making or decision-making may depend on exogenously-driven shocks that &quot;undermine institutionally entrenched policy equilibria&quot; and may not always be functional in terms of sufficiently preventing and solving problems, especially when unpopular policies, regulation of influential entities with vested interests, international coordination and non-reactive strategic long-term thinking and management are needed. In that sense, &quot;reactive sequencing&quot; refers to &quot;the notion that early events in a sequence set in motion a chain of causally linked reactions and counter-reactions which trigger subsequent development&quot;. This is a concept separate to policy sequencing in that the latter may require actions from a multitude of parties at different stages for progress of the sequence, rather than an initial &quot;shock&quot;, force-exertion or catalysis of chains of events.

In the modern highly interconnected world, polycentric governance has become ever more important – such &quot;requires a complex combination of multiple levels and diverse types of organizations drawn from the public, private, and voluntary sectors that have overlapping realms of responsibility and functional capacities&quot;. Key components of policies include command-and-control measures, enabling measures, monitoring, incentives and disincentives.

Science-based policy, related to the more narrow concept of evidence-based policy, may have also become more important. A review about worldwide pollution as a major cause of death – where it found little progress, suggests that successful control of conjoined threats such as pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss requires a global, &quot;formal science–policy interface&quot;, e.g. to &quot;inform intervention, influence research, and guide funding&quot;. Broadly, science–policy interfaces include both science in policy and science for policy.

<doc id="375094" wikidata="Q623323" url="?curid=375094" title="Malvern, Worcestershire">
<text>Malvern (, locally also: ) is a spa town and civil parish in Worcestershire, England. It lies at the foot of the Malvern Hills, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The centre of Malvern, Great Malvern, is a historic conservation area, which grew dramatically in Victorian times due to the natural mineral water springs in the vicinity, including Malvern Water.

At the 2021 census it had a population of 30,462. It includes Great Malvern on the steep eastern flank of the Malvern Hills, as well as the former independent urban district of Malvern Link. Many of the major suburbs and settlements that comprise the town are separated by large tracts of open common land and fields, and together with smaller civil parishes adjoining the town&#x27;s boundaries and the hills, the built up area is often referred to collectively as The Malverns.

Archaeological evidence suggests that Bronze Age people had settled in the area around 1000 BC, although it is not known whether these settlements were permanent or temporary. The town itself was founded in the 11th century when Benedictine monks established a priory at the foot of the highest peak of Malvern Hills. During the 19th century Malvern developed rapidly from a village to a sprawling conurbation owing to its popularity as a hydrotherapy spa based on its spring waters. Immediately following the decline of spa tourism towards the end of the 19th century, the town&#x27;s focus shifted to education with the establishment of several private boarding schools in former hotels and large villas. A further major expansion was the result of the relocation of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) to Malvern in 1942. QinetiQ, TRE&#x27;s successor company, remained the town&#x27;s largest local employer in 2009.

Malvern is the largest place in the parliamentary constituency of West Worcestershire and the district of Malvern Hills, being also the district&#x27;s administrative seat. It lies adjacent to the Malvern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The civil parish is governed by Malvern Town Council from its offices in Great Malvern.

==Toponymy==
The name Malvern is derived from the ancient British or old Welsh &quot;moel-bryn&quot;, meaning &quot;Bare or Bald Hill&quot;, the modern equivalent being the Welsh &quot;moelfryn&quot; (bald hill). It has been known as Malferna (11th century), Malverne (12th century), and Much Malvern (16–17th century).

==History==
===Bronze Age to monastic times===

Flint axes, arrowheads, and flakes found in the area are attributed to early Bronze Age settlers, and the &quot;Shire Ditch&quot;, a late Bronze Age boundary earthwork possibly dating from around 1000 BC, was constructed along part of the crest of the hills near the site of later settlements. The Wyche Cutting, a pass through the hills, was in use in prehistoric times as part of the salt route from Droitwich to South Wales. A 19th-century discovery of over two hundred metal money bars suggests that the area had been inhabited by the La Tène people around 250 BC. Ancient folklore has it that the British chieftain Caractacus made his last stand against the Romans at the British Camp, a site of extensive Iron Age earthworks on a summit of the Malvern Hills close to where Malvern was to be later established. The story remains disputed, however, as Roman historian Tacitus implies a site closer to the river Severn. There is therefore no evidence that Roman presence ended the prehistoric settlement at British Camp. However, excavations at nearby Midsummer Hill fort, Bredon Hill, and Croft Ambrey all show evidence of violent destruction around the year 48 AD. This may suggest that the British Camp was abandoned or destroyed around the same time.

A study made by Royal Commission in 2005 that includes aerial photographs of the Hills &quot;amply demonstrates the archaeological potential of this largely neglected landscape, and provides food for thought for a number of research projects&quot;. A pottery industry based on the Malverns left remains dating from the Late Bronze Age to the Norman Conquest, shown by methods of archaeological petrology. Via the River Severn, products were traded as far as South Wales. The Longdon and other marshes at the foot of Malvern Chase were grazed by cattle. &quot;Woodland management was considerable&quot;, providing fuel for the kilns.

===Monastic Malvern===

Little is known about Malvern over the next thousand years until it is described as &quot;an hermitage, or some kind of religious house, for seculars, before the conquest, endowed by the gift of Edward the Confessor&quot;. The additions to William Dugdale&#x27;s &quot;Monasticon&quot; include an extract from the Pleas taken before the King at York in 1387, stating that there was a congregation of hermits at Malvern &quot;some time before the conquest&quot;. Although a Malvern priory existed before the Norman Conquest, it is the settlement of nearby Little Malvern, the site of another, smaller priory, that is mentioned in the Domesday Book. A motte-and-bailey castle built on the top tier of the earthworks of the British Camp just before the Norman Conquest was probably founded by the Saxon Earl Harold Godwinson of Hereford. It was destroyed by King Henry II in 1155.

The town developed around its 11th-century priory, a Benedictine monastery, of which only the large parish church and the abbey gateway remain. Several slightly different histories explain the actual founding of the religious community. Legend tells that the settlement began following the murder of St. Werstan, a monk of Deerhurst, who fled from the Danes and took refuge in the woods of Malvern, where the hermitage had been established. St Werstan&#x27;s oratory is thought to have been on the site of St Michael&#x27;s Chapel, which is believed to have stood on the site of Bello Sguardo, a Victorian Villa, which was built on the site of Hermitage Cottage. The cottage was demolished in 1825 and ecclesiastical carvings were found in it, along with a mediaeval undercroft, human bones, and parts of a coffin. Although the legend may be monastic mythology, historians have however concluded that St. Werstan was the original martyr.
The first prior, Aldwyn, founded the monastery on his bishop&#x27;s advice, and by 1135 the monastery included thirty monks. Aldwyn was succeeded by Walcher of Malvern, an astronomer and philosopher from Lorraine in France, whose gravestone inside the priory church records details that the priory arose in 1085 from a hermitage endowed by Edward the Confessor. An ancient stained glass window in the Priory church depicts the legend of St. Werstan, with details of his vision, the consecration of his chapel, Edward the Confessor granting the charter for the site, and Werstan&#x27;s martyrdom.

An 18th-century document states that in the 18th year of the reign of William the Conqueror (probably 1083), a priory was dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. &quot;Victoria County History&quot; describes how a hermit Aldwyn, who lived in the reign of Edward the Confessor, had petitioned the Earl of Gloucester for the original site (of the Priory) in the wood, and cites his source as &quot;Gervase of Canterbury, &quot;Mappa Mundi&quot; (Rolls ser.)&quot;.

Large estates in Malvern were part of crown lands given to Gilbert &quot;the Red&quot;, the seventh Earl of Gloucester and sixth Earl of Hertford, on his marriage to Joan of Acre the daughter of Edward I, in 1290. Disputed hunting rights on these led to several armed conflicts with Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford that Edward resolved. Nott states that Gilbert made gifts to the Priory, and describes his &quot;great conflict&quot; with Thomas de Cantilupe, Bishop of Hereford, also about hunting rights and a ditch that Gilbert dug, that was settled by costly litigation. Gilbert had a similar conflict with Godfrey Giffard, Bishop and Administrator of Worcester Cathedral (and formerly Chancellor of England). Godfrey, who had granted land to the Priory, had jurisdictional disputes about Malvern Priory, resolved by Robert Burnell, the current Chancellor.

A discussion in 2005 about the stained glass windows of the Priory Church in terms of the relationship between Church and Laity stresses the importance of Malvern in the development of stained glass. It refers to &quot;the vast and strategically important estates of which Malvern was a part&quot; in the 15th and 16th centuries, to a widespread awareness of Malvern Priory, to the likelihood of a pilgrimage route through the town. The discussion also mentions Thomas Walsingham&#x27;s view that Malvern was a hiding place of the Lollard knight Sir John Oldcastle in 1414. Chambers wrote, in relation to the stained glass, &quot;the situation of Malvern was so much admired by Henry VII, his Queen (Elizabeth of York) and their two Sons, Prince Arthur, and Prince Henry&quot; that they made substantial endowments.

As a Royal forest, the area and the surrounding chase were subject to forest law. By Tudor times, royal lands had become used as commons and forest law had fallen into disuse.

===Post dissolution===
During the Dissolution of the Monasteries the local commissioners were instructed to ensure that abbey churches used for parish worship, should continue or could be purchased by parishioners. Malvern Priory was thus acquired by a William Pinnocke and with it, much of the 15th century stained glass windows. The monastic buildings were taken apart and anything usable was sold off. With the exception of the church building (of which the south transept adjoining the monastery&#x27;s cloisters was destroyed), all that remains of Malvern&#x27;s monastery is the Abbey Gateway (also known as the Priory Gatehouse) that houses today&#x27;s Malvern Museum.

The contemporary antiquary John Leland described the Malvern Hills and Hanley Castle. An Elizabethan land grant of 1558 mentions Holy Well. A Crown grant of tithes in 1589 mentions lambs, pigs, calves, eggs, hemp and flax. Elizabeth made her Chancellor, Sir Thomas Bromley, the Lord of the Manor.

King Charles I attempted to enclose and sell two thirds of the Chase, as part of a wider attempt to raise revenue for the Crown from the sale of Royal forests. The attempts to enclose the lands, used as commons, resulted in riots, part of a pattern of disturbances that ran across the disafforested royal lands. In 1633, the Court of Exchequer Chamber decreed the rights of the public to two thirds of the lands on the Malvern Hills, and rights of Sir Cornelius Vermuyden and his descendants, and the Crown, to one third (quoted in the preamble to the Malvern Hills Act of 1884). By that time, Malvern had become an established community and the major settlement in the Malvern Chase.

===Development as a spa (17th–19th centuries)===

The purported health-giving properties of Malvern water and the natural beauty of the surroundings led to the development of Malvern as a spa, with resources for invalids for tourists. According to legend, the curative benefit of the spring water was known in mediaeval times. The medicinal value and the bottling of Malvern water are mentioned &quot;in a poem attributed to the Reverend Edmund Rea, who became Vicar of Great Malvern in 1612&quot;. The occulist Richard Banister wrote about the &quot;Eye Well&quot;, close to the &quot;Holy Well&quot;, in a short poem in his &quot;Breviary of the Eyes&quot; (see Malvern water), in 1622. In 1756, Dr. John Wall published a 14-page pamphlet on the benefits of Malvern water, that reached a 158-page 3rd edition in 1763. Further praise came from the botanist Benjamin Stillingfleet in 1757, the poet Thomas Warton in 1790, and William Addison, the physician of the Duchess of Kent (mother of Queen Victoria) in 1828, all quoted in a review by the medical historian W.H. McMenemy. In his lecture about Malvern at the Royal Institution, Addison spoke of &quot;its pure and invigorating air, the excellence of its water, and the romantic beauty of its scenery&quot;. Similar views appeared in the press, Nicholas Vansittart brought his wife Catherine to Malvern for a rest cure in 1809. Chambers, in his book about Malvern, praised Elizabeth, Countess Harcourt (daughter-in-law of the 1st Earl Harcourt), whose patronage contributed to the development of hillside walks.

Bottling and shipping of the Malvern water grew in volume. In 1842, Dr. James Wilson and Dr. James Manby Gully, leading exponents of hydrotherapy, set up clinics in Malvern (Holyrood House for women and Tudor House for men). Malvern expanded rapidly as a residential spa. Several large hotels and many of the large villas date from its heyday. Many smaller hotels and guest houses were built between about 1842 and 1875. By 1855 there were already 95 hotels and boarding houses and by 1865 over a quarter of the town&#x27;s 800 houses were hospitality venues. Most were in Great Malvern, the town centre, while others were in the surrounding settlements of Malvern Wells, Malvern Link, North Malvern and West Malvern.

Queen Adelaide visited St. Ann&#x27;s Well in September 1842. &quot;Throughout the 1840s and 1850s Malvern attracted a stream of celebrated visitors, including royalty.&quot; Patients included Charles Darwin, Catherine, wife of Charles Dickens,
 Thomas Carlyle, Florence Nightingale, Lord Lytton, who was an outspoken advocate of the waters, Lord Tennyson and Samuel Wilberforce.

The extension of the railway from Worcester to Malvern Link was completed on 25 May 1859. The following year, &quot;Besides middle class visitors ... the railway also brought working class excursionists from the Black Country with dramatic effect ... At Whitsuntide ... 10,000 came from the Black Country to the newly opened stations at Great Malvern and Malvern Wells. Throughout June to September, day trips were frequent, causing the &quot;town to be crowded with &#x27;the most curious specimens of the British shopkeeper and artisan on an outing&#x27; &quot;.

Following Malvern&#x27;s new-found fame as a spa and area of natural beauty, and fully exploiting its new rail connections, factories from as far as Manchester were organising day trips for their employees, often attracting as many as 5,000 visitors a day. In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares – by then twice that of other lines – that were exploiting the tourism industry, and demanded a limitation to the number of excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area&#x27;s popularity as a winter resort.

The 1887 Baedeker&#x27;s includes Malvern in a London–Worcester–Hereford itinerary and described as &quot;an inland health resort, famous for its bracing air and pleasant situation&quot; and &quot;a great educational centre&quot;, with five hotels that are &quot;well spoken of&quot;, a commercial hotel, the Assembly Rooms and Gardens, and many excursions on foot, pony and by carriage. Other descriptions of the diversions mention bands, quadrilles, cricket (residents &quot;vs&quot; visitors) and billiard rooms. The Duchess of Teck stayed, with her daughter Mary (later queen consort of George V), in Malvern in the Autumn of 1891, joined by Lady Eva Greville. and the Duke of Teck. The Duchess was &quot;perfectly enchanted with Malvern and its surroundings&quot; and, with the Duke, visited Malvern College. The Duchess returned to open the new waterworks at Camp Hill in 1895. In 1897, the painter Edward Burne-Jones came to Malvern for the &quot;bracing air&quot;, on the recommendation of his doctor, but stayed in his hotel for a week. The 7-year-old Franklin D. Roosevelt visited in 1889, during a trip to Europe with his parents.

By 1875 encroachment on Malvern&#x27;s wastelands by landowners had reached new heights and action was taken by the people of Malvern and the Commons Society to preserve the hills and common land and to prevent encroachment. Local lords of the manor indicated that they would like to give their rights to the wastes to the public. After preventing the enclosure of a common in 1882, negotiations were initiated with the owners of the northern hills and the first Malvern Hills Act was secured in parliament in 1884. Later Acts empowered the Malvern Hills Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on common land and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the popularity of the hydrotherapy had declined to the extent that many hotels were already being converted into private boarding schools and rest homes, and education became the basis of Malvern&#x27;s economy. By 1865, the town already had 17 single-gender private schools, increasing to 25 by 1885. The area was well suited for schools due to its established attractive environment and access by rail. Children could travel unaccompanied with their trunks by rail to their boarding schools near the stations in Great Malvern, Malvern Wells, and Malvern Link. Malvern St James (formerly Malvern Girls College), in a former hotel, opposite Great Malvern railway station, has a tunnel (now derelict) to the basement of the building, which is visible from both platforms of the station.

===20th century===
Malvern began to develop into a modern town in the early 1900s, with a continuing strong agricultural presence. Modernisation continued, and the World War II years transformed the population and its activities, establishing the town as a centre of scientific research.

==Governance==

Malvern is a town and civil parish governed at the lowest tier of local government by Malvern Town Council, part of the Malvern Hills District of the County of Worcestershire (a district comprising 68 civil parishes and 22 electoral wards). The ward boundaries were redefined from the wards of the former Malvern Urban District Council (1900–1974). Through the many changes in local government infrastructure since the beginning of the 20th century, the importance and distinction by local boundaries of the historical areas of Great Malvern, Malvern Link, North Malvern, Cowleigh, and other neighbourhoods, have been lost.

The original parish of Great Malvern included the hamlet of Guarlford and the chapelry of Newland, and stretched from the River Severn on the east to the Malvern Hills on the west. Guarlford became a separate civil parish in 1894 when, under the Local Government Act of 1894, urban district councils were created for Malvern and Malvern Link. The Guarlford parish covered much of eastern Malvern, including parts of Great Malvern, Pickersleigh, Poolbrook, Barnards Green, Hall Green and Sherrard&#x27;s Green. By 1900 however, the urban districts of Malvern and Malvern Link amalgamated, absorbing parts of neighbouring parishes to create a town of six wards under the Malvern Urban District Council. In 1934 the boundaries changed again, and those areas came under the control of the Malvern council.

Residents of Malvern Town in the six Malvern Town Council electoral wards are represented by 15 elected members. The council is supported by a team of senior executives that includes a Town Clerk, a Deputy Town Clerk, a PA to the Town Clerk and chairman, an Operations and Events Officer, a Finance Officer, two Operations Managers, an Operations Supervisor, and eight Grounds Maintenance Operatives. The wards are based on the distribution of the population and generally ignore the names of the neighbourhoods and suburbs they contain, and use loaned names:
* Chase — named after Malvern Chase — covering much of the adjacent town centre suburb Barnards Green, the extensive Ministry of Defence property occupied by QinetiQ, the campus of The Chase School, the village of Poolbrook, and the largely rural south-eastern area of the adjoining Poolbrook and Malvern commons.
* Dyson Perrins, the northern part of Malvern adjacent to Link with the campus of Dyson Perrins School and the former MoD DERA North Site, and the former hamlets of Interfield, Halfkey, and Upper Howsell; this ward includes a new neighbourhood of the town — Malvern Vale.
* Link, that covers most of the area north of the Link Common from Link Top, through Malvern Link to Newland, and Upper and Lower Howsell.
* North Malvern - West Malvern, Served by West Malvern Road, an area immediately west of the range of hills between Link Top and West Malvern civil parish that includes the former village of Cowleigh.
* Pickersleigh, that includes the part of the former Great Malvern boundaries east of the railway between Barnards Green and Malvern Link to Madresfield, the former hamlets of Hall Green and Sherrards Green, and part of Barnards Green.
* Priory, covering much of Great Malvern, including all the town centre, and otherwise areas west of the railway between North Malvern and Malvern Wells civil parish.

==Geography==
===Town centre===
The town centre comprises two main streets at right angles to each other: the steep Church Street and Bellevue Terrace, a relatively flat north–south extension of the A449 which forms Malvern&#x27;s western extremity along the flank of the hills. Among the many shops are two large modern supermarkets, both in Edith Walk, formerly a steep and unmade lane that served the rear entrances of the shops in Church Street. Many of the traditional high street shops such as butchers, bakers, grocers etc., are now health food shops, art and craft shops, charity shops, law firms, and estate agents.

The offices of Malvern Town Council, the Malvern Hills Conservators, The Malvern Hills AONB Partnership, and Malvern Hills District Council are in the town centre. The town&#x27;s amenities include the Malvern Theatres complex, the Priory Park, the Splash leisure and swimming complex, the main library, the police station, the tourist information centre, and the museum. In the heart of the town is a statue of the composer Edward Elgar, while other statuary is dedicated to Malvern water.

Great Malvern station, a listed example of classical Victorian railway architecture, is close to the nearby former Imperial Hotel by the same architect, E. W. Elmslie.

===Suburbs and neighbourhoods===

Malvern&#x27;s rapid urbanisation during the latter half of the 19th century spread eastwards and northwards from Great Malvern, the traditional town centre on the steep flank of the Worcestershire Beacon, and engulfed the manors and farms in the immediate area. It was often the farms, such as Pickersleigh (now known as Pickersleigh Court and previously known as Pickersleigh House), near Great Malvern, and the Howsells in Malvern Link which merged with Great Malvern in 1900 that gave their names to many of the new neighbourhoods. The urban agglomeration continued to spread, and by the middle of the 20th century had reached the suburban parishes of West Malvern, Malvern Wells, Newland, Madresfield, and Guarlford.

===Climate===
Malvern lies in the Lower Severn/Avon plain affording it a degree of shelter caused by virtue of its nestling in between the Cotswold hills to the east, the Welsh Hills and Mountains to the west, and Birmingham plateau to the north. Although as with all the British Isles it has a maritime climate, the local topography means summer warmth can become emphasised by a slight foehn effect off the surrounding hills. The record maximum stands at 35.8c(96.4f) set in August 1990. Typically 17.3 days of the year will reach 25.1c(77.2f) or higher and the annual warmest day should reach 29.8c(85.6f) according to the 1971–00 observing period.

Winter temperature inversions can also occur given the correct conditions allowing very low minima to occur. Nonetheless, on average the region is one of the warmest non-coastal areas in the UK, with overall night time minima in particular rivalling more urban areas. Indeed, despite the notable low absolute minima (several weather-observing sites nearby having fallen below −20 °C in the past) the annual average frost ratio is a mere 33 days per year (1971–00), actually lower than more urbanised weather station locations such as London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport. A new absolute minimum of −19.5 °C (−3.1 °F) was recently set during the record cold month December 2010. Prior to this the coldest nights were recorded in the winter of 1981/82; -18.1 °C (−0.6 °F) in December 1981, −18.0 °C (−0.4 °F) in January 1982.

The sunniest year was 2003, when 1776 hours of sunshine were recorded.
Rainfall averages around 740mm per year with over 1 mm being recorded on 123 days of the year.
Snowfall is highly variable. When winter low pressure systems move from south-west to north-east the Malvern area is often on the northern flank, meaning heavy snowfall while areas further south and east receive rain or no precipitation at all. However, when snowfall arrives by means of convective showers driven by northerly, north–westerly or north–easterly winds the area tends to be one of the least snowy parts of the UK, owing to its sheltered positioning.

==Demography==
At the 2011 UK census, the civil parish of Malvern had a population of 29,626. Together with the neighbouring parishes of West Malvern, Malvern Wells, Little Malvern and Newland (the settlements of which largely unite with that of Malvern) the population of the wider &quot;Malverns&quot; urban area is 34,517 (as of 2011).

For the purposes of statistical reporting the Office for National Statistics groups the population of the North Malvern ward of the Malvern civil parish with that of the West Malvern civil parish. For every 100 females, there were 91.7 males. The average household size was 2.4. Of those aged 16–74 in Malvern, 48.1% had no academic qualifications or one General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), above the figures for all of the Malvern Hills local government district (39.7%) and England (45.5%). According to the census, 2.3% were unemployed and 35.0% were economically inactive. 19.7% of the population were under the age of 16 and 11.5% were aged 75 and over; the mean age of the people of the civil parish was 41.5. 66.8% of residents described their health as &quot;good&quot;, similar to the average of 69.1% for the wider district.

===Ethnicity===
The 2011 census found the White British ethnic group to be by far the largest in Malvern with 93.2% identifying as such. The next largest ethnic group was White Other, which accounted for 3.2% of the population, followed by the Asian and Mixed Race categories, which made up 1.9% and 1.2% of the population. Black ethnic groups made up 0.3% and the Other group constituted 0.2% of the population.

===Population development===

The area remained a village and cluster of manors and farms until &quot;taking of the water&quot; in Malvern became popularised by Dr. Wall in 1756. By the 1820s the Baths and the Pump Room were opened; in 1842 Drs. James Wilson and James Manby Gully opened up water cure establishments in the town centre. By the middle of the 19th century, with the arrival of the railway, bath houses and other establishments catering for the health tourists flourished. By the early 20th century Malvern had developed from a small village centred on its priory to a town with many large hotels and Victorian and Edwardian country villas.

Malvern&#x27;s population grew in 1942 when the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) moved to Malvern, bringing 2,500 employees, increasing to around 3,500 by 1945. In the early 1950s, several large housing estates were built in Malvern by the government to provide accommodation for the staff and their families. A significant proportion of the current population of Malvern are present and former employees of the facility (now called QinetiQ), and its previously attached military contingent from REME and other units of all three British armed forces.

Malvern had already become an overspill for the nearby city of Worcester, and the new motorways constructed in the early 1960s brought the industrial Midlands within commuting distance by car. With this development came the construction of large private housing developments. The town continues to swell as increasingly more farmland, especially in the Malvern Link area between the villages of Guarlford and Newland, is turned over to housing projects creating new communities and suburbs.

Due to frequent merging of parishes and changes in boundaries, accurate figures based on specific areas are not available.

==Economy==
===Research and development===
Since 1942, research and development into defence physics and electronics has been the major source of employment in Malvern, when, during World War II, the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) moved there from Worth Matravers on the south coast, for safety from enemy action. The Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE) was moved to Malvern at the same time. Initially, TRE was housed at Malvern College.

TRE was the main United Kingdom research and development organization for radio navigation, radar, infrared detection for heat-seeking missiles, and related work for the Royal Air Force (RAF), during World War II and the years that followed. It was regarded as &quot;the most brilliant and successful of the English wartime research establishments&quot; under &quot;[Albert] Rowe, who saw more of the English scientific choices between 1935 and 1945 than any single man&quot;. TRE and RRDE merged in 1953 to form the Radar Research Establishment (RRE), which was further renamed to Royal Radar Establishment (also RRE) in 1955. In 2001, the facility was partly transferred from governmental ownership to private ownership, and became QinetiQ. The DSTL, which is the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, has since closed down, with the remaining staff moving to other DSTL sites.

With the recognised science and technology developments in the Malvern area, Malvern Hills Science Park was built in 1999, and is now home to over 30 science and technological businesses, including, UTC Aerospace Systems (formerly Goodrich Corporation), and Textlocal.

===Manufacturing===
Other manufacturing and service industries are mainly grouped in the Spring Lane Industrial Estate that was developed in the 1960s and the adjoining Enigma Business Park that was begun in the 1990s.

Pipe organs have been built in Malvern since 1841 by Nicholson Organs. Nicholson organs can be found in Gloucester and Portsmouth Cathedrals, and Great Malvern Priory. Cars have been constructed in Malvern since 1894 by Santler (Britain&#x27;s first petrol car) and 1910 by the Morgan Motor Company, one of the world&#x27;s longest-existing private constructors of automobiles produced in series. The Morgan Motor Car is a traditional sports roadster and over the years has become a &#x27;cult&#x27; vehicle, exported all over the world from the factory in Malvern Link. Specialist glass tubing and microscope slides are produced by Chance Brothers in their factory in Malvern next door to the Morgan Motor works.

===Agriculture and horticulture===
Malvern is a centre for agricultural industry. The Three Counties Showground, operated by the Three Counties Agricultural Society, is a few miles to the south of Malvern on the road to Upton upon Severn. It has been the permanent venue for the Royal Three Counties Show, held each year in June, since 1958. Representing the counties of Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire, it is one of the most important agricultural shows in the UK, and can be traced back to 1797. It attracts an average of 93,000 visitors over its three-day event, and the event almost doubles the town&#x27;s local population. The showground also hosts the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Spring Gardening Show, followed by many other events throughout the year including other regular gardening shows. The &quot;Lobelia&quot; pioneers William Crump and Dr. Brent Elliott worked in Malvern and were awarded the Victoria Medal of Honour of the Royal Horticultural Society. A tea rose was named for the Malvern rose grower Mrs. Foley Hobbs in 1910 (see page 119 of cited work). As well as agricultural and horticultural shows, the showground holds regular antique and flea markets throughout the year. These have become some of the largest in the UK, attracting thousands of visitors each year.

==Culture==
===Architecture===

The town centre and its environs contain many examples of Regency, Victorian and Edwardian villas and hotels. Many of the houses were built during the Industrial Revolution and Malvern&#x27;s boom years as a spa town by wealthy families from the nearby Birmingham area. Following the collapse of the spa industry, many of the hotels and villas became schools, and some have since been further converted to apartments, while some of the smaller hotels are now retirement homes. The Imperial Hotel in red brick with stone dressings, which later became a school, is one of the largest buildings in Malvern. It was built in 1860 by the architect E. W. Elmslie who also designed the Great Malvern railway station, and the Council House on the plot where Dr. Gully&#x27;s original house stood. The Grove in Avenue Road in 1867, originally to be his private residence in 1927 became part of the Lawnside School for girls, and in 1860 Whitbourne Hall, a Grade II* listed building, in Herefordshire. The Imperial was the first hotel to be lit by incandescent gas. It was equipped with all types of baths, and brine was brought specially by rail from Droitwich.

Much architecture and statuary in the town centre is dedicated to Malvern water, including the St Ann&#x27;s Well, which is housed in a building dating from 1813.

===Music===
Sir Edward Elgar, British composer and Master of the King&#x27;s Musick, lived much of his life around Malvern. His &quot;Pomp and Circumstance, March No. 1&quot;, composed in 1901 and to which the words of &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; were later set, was first performed in the Wyche School next to the church in the presence of Elgar. A sculpture group by artist Rose Garrard comprising the &quot;Enigma&quot; fountain together with a statue of Elgar gazing over Great Malvern stands on Belle Vue Terrace in the town centre. The &quot;Elgar Route&quot;, a drive passing some key landmarks from Elgar&#x27;s life, passes through Malvern.
Malvern Concert Club, founded in 1903 by Elgar, holds concerts held in the Forum Theatre, Malvern Theatres. Its programmes focus on renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic and contemporary music.

The Chandos Symphony Orchestra, under the professional direction of Michael Lloyd, has over 100 players. It specialises in performances of major works of the 19th and 20th Centuries. The &quot;Autumn in Malvern Festival&quot; is an annual event featuring performances of artists of music, poetry, writers and film makers held during October every year. The Colwell and other brass bands of the early century were part of the music of the town. The British violinist Nigel Kennedy lived in Malvern for many years and gives concerts in the town&#x27;s culture venue.
 Julius Harrison (1885–1963), lived in Pickersleigh Road for most of the 1940s and was music director at Malvern College and director of the early Elgar Festivals in Malvern.

In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the Malvern Winter Gardens was a major regional venue for concerts by popular rock bands, including The Rolling Stones, Dave Berry, T-Rex, The Jam, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, The Undertones, and Joy Division. Many of the 1960s concerts were staged by Bannister promotions while later events were promoted by Cherry Red, a London-based independent record label formed in 1978.

===Drama===

Malvern Theatres, housed in the Winter Gardens complex in the town centre, is a provincial centre for the arts. The first Malvern Drama Festival, which took place in 1929, was dedicated to Bernard Shaw and planned by Sir Barry Jackson. A number of works have had their first performances at Malvern, six by Shaw including In &quot;Good King Charles&#x27;s Golden Days&quot;, the 1929 English première of &quot;The Apple Cart&quot;, and the world première of &quot;Geneva&quot; in 1938. In 1956 Malvern held a Shaw centenary week. In February 1965 a Malvern Festival Theatre Trust was set up, and extensive refurbishment was undertaken. J. B. Priestley presided over the opening ceremony of the first summer season. In 1998, a further £7.2 million major redesign and refurbishment took place with the help of contributions from the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF), administered by the government Department for Culture, Media and Sport. As part of a government funded £20 million extension planned for completion in 2026, a £2.25 million extension including a modern frontage was opened in July 2023.

The Theatre of Small Convenience entered the &quot;Guinness World Records &quot; in 2002 as the smallest theatre in the world. Housed in a former Victorian public convenience in the centre of the town in Edith Walk, the theatre had a capacity of 12 people. Before closing in 2017, the theatre regularly hosted puppetry, professional and amateur actors, drama, poetry, storytelling, and opera.

===Literature===
William Langland&#x27;s famous 14th-century poem &quot;The Visions of Piers Plowman&quot; (1362) was inspired by the Malvern Hills and the earliest poetic allusion to them occurs in the poem &quot;And on a Maye mornynge on Malverne hylles&quot;. Langland, the reputed writer, was possibly educated at the priory of Great Malvern. Several roads and buildings in Malvern are named after him.

Malvern entered the writings and lives of several 17th–19th century poets. These include
:Michael Drayton: &quot;While Malvern, king of hills, Severn overlooks&quot;, (&quot;Poly-Olbion&quot;, 1613, song 7),
:John Dyer: &quot;By the blue steeps of distant Malvern wall&#x27;d&quot; (&quot;The fleece&quot;, 1757, about sheep farming),
:Thomas Warton: &quot;Health opes the healing power her chosen fount/ In ... Malvern&#x27;s ample mount&quot;, (1790, &quot;Ode on his Majesty&#x27;s birthday&quot;),
:Thomas Gray visited in 1770 during his final travels,
:Joseph Cottle: &quot;As I climb ... One mass of glory ... A fairy vision!&quot; (&quot;The Malvern Hills&quot;, 1798),
:William Wordsworth: church bells ring as &quot;high as Malvern&#x27;s cloudy crest&quot; (1835, &quot;St. Catherine of Ledbury&quot;),
:Patrick Tytler died in Great Malvern, in 1849,
:Lord Macaulay: &quot;Till twelve fair counties saw the blaze on Malvern&#x27;s lonely height&quot; (&quot;The Armada&quot;).

C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien are among the authors that have frequented Malvern. Legend states that, after drinking in a Malvern pub one winter evening, they were walking home when it started to snow. They saw a lamp post shining out through the snow and Lewis turned to his friends and said &quot;that would make a very nice opening line to a book&quot;. The novel &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; by Lewis later used that image as the characters enter the realm of Narnia. Tolkien found inspiration in the Malvern landscape which he had viewed from his childhood home in Birmingham and his brother Hilary&#x27;s home near Evesham. He was introduced to the area by Lewis, who had brought him here to meet George Sayer, the Head of English at Malvern College. Sayer had been a student of Lewis, and became his biographer, and together with them Tolkien would walk the Malvern Hills. Recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; were made in Malvern in 1952, at the home of George Sayer. The recordings were later issued on long-playing gramophone records. In the liner notes for &quot;J.R.R Tolkien Reads and Sings his The Hobbit &amp; The Fellowship of the Rings&quot;, George Sayer wrote that Tolkien would relive the book as they walked and compared parts of the Malvern Hills to the White Mountains of Gondor.

The poet W. H. Auden taught for three years in the 1930s at The Downs School, in the Malvern Hills. He wrote many poems there, including: &quot;This Lunar Beauty&quot;; &quot;Let Your Sleeping Head&quot;; &quot;My Love, Fish in the Unruffled Lakes&quot;; and &quot;Out on the Lawn I Lie in Bed&quot;. He also wrote the long poem about the hills and their views, called simply &quot;The Malverns&quot;.

In his 1941 novel &quot;Mr Lucton&#x27;s Freedom&quot; Halesowen-born novelist Francis Brett Young describes sleeping out on the Malvern Hills and seeing the sunrise over the town.

===Art===

Works of art in Malvern include fountains, statues, and Malvern water spouts by the sculptor Rose Garrard. Among her sculptures are the statue of Sir Edward Elgar and the &quot;Enigma Fountain&quot; (Unveiled by Prince Andrew, Duke of York on Belle Vue Terrace, Malvern on 26 May 2000). and the drinking spout, &quot;Malvhina&quot;, also on Belle Vue Terrace, which was unveiled on 4 September 1998.
Garrard&#x27;s &quot;Hand of Peace&quot; war memorial, a sculpture in Portland stone is in the Barnards Green suburb of Malvern.

Paintings of Malvern include &quot;Little Malvern Church&quot; by Joseph Farington now held by the Royal Academy, and a squared drawing by the art historian Robert Witt in the collection of the Courtauld Institute, Joseph Powell&#x27;s &quot;Great Malvern Priory ... from the North East&quot; (1797), now in the British Watercolours collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

David Prentice, artist and one of the founder members of Birmingham&#x27;s Ikon Gallery, has lived and worked in Malvern since 1990. He started painting the Malvern Hills when he retired in 1983.

A sculpture of two buzzards by Walenty Pytel was installed in Rosebank Gardens, Great Malvern to commemorate the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in November 2012.

===Television===
&quot;Elgar&quot;, a drama documentary made in 1962 by the British director Ken Russell, was filmed on location in Malvern and Worcester. Several scenes were filmed in Malvern at locations including &#x27;Forli&#x27; in Alexandra Road, &#x27;Craeg Lea&#x27; in Malvern Wells and St Ann&#x27;s Well in Great Malvern. Made for BBC Television&#x27;s long-running &quot;Monitor&quot; programme, it dramatised the life of the composer Edward Elgar. The film significantly raised the public profile of the composer.

The Malvern landscape forms the backdrop for &quot;Penda&#x27;s Fen&quot;, a 1974 British television play written by David Rudkin and directed by Alan Clarke for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; series. It tells the story of Stephen, a vicar&#x27;s son who has visions of angels, Edward Elgar, and King Penda, the last pagan ruler of England. The final scene of the play, where the protagonist has an apparitional experience of King Penda and the &quot;mother and father of England&quot; and King Penda, is set on the Malvern Hills.

The Tank Quarry on North Hill and West of England Quarry on the Worcestershire Beacon were used as locations in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Krotons&quot;, starring Patrick Troughton. The serial was broadcast in four weekly parts from 28 December 1968 to 18 January 1969.

Great Malvern railway station featured in 1975 as the commuter-belt railway station in the first episode of Survivors (1975 TV series), the post-apocalyptic fiction drama television series created by Terry Nation and produced by Terence Dudley at the BBC.

===Local media===
Regional TV news is provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from either the Sutton Coldfield and local relay transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Hereford and Worcester, Heart West Midlands, Radio Wyvern, Capital Mid-Counties, Greatest Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire, Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire, and Smooth West Midlands.

The Malvern Gazette and &quot;Malvern Observer&quot; are the town&#x27;s local newspapers.

===Malvern water===
Malvern spring water flows freely from a number of fountains or spouts throughout the Malvern area. Upkeep of these historical springs is funded by several organisations, including the Town Council, the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Malvern Spa Association, and the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The water became famous for containing &quot;nothing at all&quot;. It was the reason for Malvern becoming a spa town and has formed a part of both local and national culture since Queen Elizabeth I made a point of drinking it in public in the 16th century, and Queen Victoria refused to travel without it. It is also a bottled water used by Queen Elizabeth II Until November 2010 when the plant was closed due to lack of profitability, millions of litres of Malvern water were bottled annually by Coca-Cola Enterprises under the Schweppes brand in a factory near Malvern and distributed worldwide. Malvern water is still being bottled from the original source by a family-run business under the name Holywell Spring Water.

===Twin town===
Malvern has since 2013 been twinned with Mariánské Lázně, a spa town in the Czech Republic, and since 2016 also with Bagnères-de-Bigorre, a spa town in France.

==Places of worship==
In addition to the 12th century priory, during and shortly after Malvern&#x27;s expansion throughout the second half of the 19th century over twenty Christian churches were built. Many of these are reproductions of 13th and 14th century architecture including Church of St Matthias, Malvern Link (C of E) begun in 1843, which has a full set of ten ringing bells on which the first full peal of Grandsire Triples was rung on 1 June 1901. One of the most recent buildings is St Mary&#x27;s Church (C of E), in Sherrards Green, a modern church built in 1958.

Pevsner mentions the following 19th and early 20th century churches in Malvern in his book on Worcestershire: 
* All Saints, (The Wyche), 1903, by Nevinson and Newton (or possibly Troyte Griffith);

Malvern has a community hospital on Worcester Road in Malvern Link. The hospital was constructed on the grounds of a former independent preparatory school, Seaford Court, and began operation in 2010. It was officially opened by The Princess Royal in March 2011. This replaced the former community hospital on Lansdowne Crescent.

Major health facilities are provided by hospitals in Worcester. The town has seven health centres, including a health complex in Malvern Link and a group practice on Pickersleigh Road. Malvern also has several nursing and retirement homes for the care of senior citizens. The Malvern area is covered by the Midlands Air Ambulance service, which has operated from the site of Strensham motorway services since 1991.

Malvern is served by the West Midlands Ambulance Service operated by the NHS Trust. The ambulance station is in Victoria Road, Great Malvern, near the town centre.

Other emergency services are provided by West Mercia Police from a station in Victoria Road, and the Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service that has a station in Worcester Road, Malvern Link.

==Transport==
Major road access to the area is provided by the A449 road that runs through the centre of Malvern, connecting it to Worcester and Ledbury. The M5 motorway (West Bromwich, north-west of Birmingham to Exeter in Devon) is accessible at junctions 7 and 8 to the east of Malvern. The M50 motorway (Tewkesbury to Ross-on-Wye), also known as the &quot;Ross Spur&quot; to the south is accessed at junction 1 on the A38 road between Tewkesbury and Malvern.

Two railway stations approximately one mile (1.6 km) apart at Great Malvern and Malvern Link. Great Western Railway and West Midlands Trains operate services as far as Hereford, Birmingham New Street, and London Paddington.

Malvern bus services include several circular urban routes connecting the main residential and commercial areas and out-of-town shopping malls. Other routes serve the surrounding villages and Worcester city centre. Most services are operated by First Midland Red.

Air services operate from Birmingham Airport, about an hour&#x27;s drive away on the M5 and M42 motorways. Gloucestershire Airport, at Staverton, in the borough of Tewkesbury, is a busy general aviation airport, used mainly for private charter and scheduled flights to such destinations as the islands of Jersey and Guernsey and the Isle of Man, for pilot training, and by the aircraft of emergency services.

Taxi services are provided by numerous local firms.

==Education==
===Primary schools===
Elementary education is provided by thirteen primary schools in the town and its suburbs including eight Church of England, one Roman Catholic, and four non-denominational state schools. With the exception of The Grove (1962), Poolbrook Primary School (1977), and Northleigh (1991) that replaced the Cowleigh C of E school destroyed by arson in 1989, all the Malvern primary schools were established between 1836 and 1916, during and shortly after the town&#x27;s rapid development as a spa.

===High schools===
The Chase School in the suburb of Barnards Green near the town centre is a secondary school with around 1300 pupils. It is a specialist Technology, Language and Science college under the specialist schools programme, previously designated a Beacon School.

Dyson Perrins Church of England Academy in the northern part of the large suburb of Malvern Link, a Church of England school with almost 1000 pupils, is a specialist Sports College.

Hanley Castle High School, with around 1000 pupils, including its sixth form centre, is a specialist Language College and was founded in 1326 as a chantry school, making it one of the oldest schools in England. Although the school is in the village of Hanley Castle, about from the town, many of its pupils come from the Malvern area.

===Independent schools===

Two large independent &#x27;public&#x27; schools – Malvern College for boys and girls and Malvern St James for girls – now remain following mergers of Malvern&#x27;s many private primary and secondary schools.

Malvern College is a coeducational public school, founded in 1865. Until 1992, it was a school for boys aged 13 to 18. Following a merger with Ellerslie School for Girls in 1992 it became coeducational. Among its alumni are two Nobel Laureates (James Meade and Francis William Aston), an Olympic Gold medalist (Arnold Jackson), and leading politicians. Further acquisition of Hillstone and merger with The Downs (in nearby Colwall) preparatory schools has established an independently run coeducational feeder school, The Downs Malvern, for pupils up to 13 years old.

Malvern St James was formed in 2006 by the merger of Malvern Girls&#x27; College and St James&#x27;s School, West Malvern (formerly St James&#x27;s and The Abbey) and other mergers with local private schools over the last thirty years. It is now the last of the independent girls&#x27; schools in the Malvern area. The main building of Malvern St James on the campus of the former Malvern Girls&#x27; College is the former Imperial Hotel, built in the second half of the 19th century. Hatley St James, a Victorian mansion on Albert Road South, and former residence of the Seton-Karr family, was used as a house for the school.

The Abbey College is an international boarding school providing education mainly for students from countries outside the United Kingdom. Founded in 1974, it provides pre university preparation for mixed gender students aged 14 to 20.

===Further education===
Malvern Hills College is a centre for further education providing government certificate vocational courses for adults and post 14-year-old students. Malvern also has an active University of the Third Age that was founded at Malvern Hills College in 1995. Its inaugural meeting was attended by around 150 members of the public, and by 2011 it had over 80 interest groups and 1,100 members.

==Leisure==

The Priory Park with its adjoining Malvern Splash pool and Winter Gardens complex occupies a large area in the centre of the town. The Winter Gardens complex is home to the Malvern Theatres, a cinema, a concert venue/banqueting room, bars and cafeterias. For almost half a century, the Malvern Winter Gardens has also been a leisure centre and a major regional venue for classical music, and concerts by major rock bands of the 60s, 70s and 80s. The Splash Leisure Complex flanks the eastern boundary of Priory Park and has an indoor swimming pool and gymnasium. In the town centre is also an extensive public Library that includes access to the Internet and many community services.

The Worcestershire Way, a waymarked long-distance trail in Worcestershire, runs from Bewdley to Great Malvern.

==Sport==
The Manor Park Club multi-sports complex, close to the town centre, provides the area with indoor and outdoor sports facilities including tennis, squash, indoor bowls, racketball, archery and table tennis. It is assisted by grants from various bodies, including the Malvern Hills District Council, the Sport England Lottery, and the Lawn Tennis Association. In 2010, a new indoor facility was unveiled at the club by tennis player Tim Henman. Traditional outdoor bowls is played on a green in Priory Park. Other public areas such as Victoria Park in Malvern Link provide space for field sports and tennis. Malvern Town FC has a football first team that plays in the Hellenic Football League and which has twice reached the third qualifying round of the FA Cup. The Malvern Hills are a popular launching site for hang gliding and paragliding and Malvern has a local hang gliding club. Cricket is provided for at Barnards Green Cricket Club, a professional class ground.

==Notable people==
In addition to those born in Malvern, many notable people came to the town to provide or partake of its Hydrotherapy, to be educated or to teach at the large number of independent boarding schools such as Malvern College with its long list of notable alumni, and its elementary school, The Downs, and Malvern St James for girls, that still remain active into the 21st century.

A significant number of people were scientists at the Telecommunications Research Establishment, and its successor the Royal Radar Establishment, the country&#x27;s largest secret defence research facility with around 4,000 civil servants and military personnel, and the quango it became (as of 2011), QinetiQ.

<text>A retriever is a type of gun dog that retrieves game for a hunter. Generally gun dogs are divided into three major classifications: retrievers, flushing spaniels, and pointing breeds. Retrievers were bred primarily to retrieve birds or other prey and return them to the hunter without damage; retrievers are distinguished in that nonslip retrieval is their primary function. As a result, retriever breeds are bred for soft mouths and a great willingness to please, learn, and obey. A soft mouth refers to the willingness of the dog to carry game in its mouth without biting into it. &quot;Hard mouth&quot; is a serious fault in a hunting dog and is very difficult to correct. A hard-mouthed dog renders game unpresentable or at worst inedible.

The retriever&#x27;s willingness to please, patient nature and trainability have made breeds such as the Labrador retriever and Golden retriever popular as a disability assistance dog. The outstanding reputation of the retriever has landed both the Labrador and the Golden retriever among the top 10 best dogs for children and families around the world.

==Skills==


To carry out the duties of a gun dog, a retriever should be trained to perform these tasks:

* Remain under control: Retrievers are typically used for waterfowl hunting. Since a majority of waterfowl hunting employs the use of small boats in winter conditions, retrievers are trained to remain under control sitting calmly and quietly until sent to retrieve. This is often referred to as &quot;steadiness&quot;. Steadiness helps to avoid an accidental capsizing, disrupting the hunter&#x27;s aim or the possible accidental discharge of a firearm which could cause serious harm or death to others in the hunting party or to the dog itself. A steady dog is also better able to “mark” downed game.
* Mark downed game: Marking is the process of watching for a falling bird or multiple birds. When the command &quot;mark&quot; is given, the dog should look up for incoming birds and remember where each bird falls. Well-trained retrievers are taught to follow the direction the gun barrel is pointing to mark where the birds fall. Once the game is downed, the handler will command the dog to retrieve the game. The dog&#x27;s ability to remember multiple “marks” is extremely important, and trainers use techniques to improve a dog&#x27;s marking and memory ability.
* Perform a blind retrieve: When hunting waterfowl, a retriever&#x27;s primary job is to retrieve downed birds. At times, a dog will not see the game fall, so retrievers are trained to take hand, voice, and whistle commands from the handler directing the dog to the downed game for retrieval. This is called a “blind retrieve”. Precision between the dog and handler is extremely useful and desired so as to minimize retrieval time and limit the disturbance of surrounding cover. The majority of blind retrieves in the field are made within 30-80 yards of the gun, but a good retriever/handler team can perform precise blind retrieves out to 100+ yards and more.
* Retrieve to hand: Although some hunters prefer to have a bird dropped at their feet, the majority of handlers require the dog to deliver the game to hand, meaning once the dog has completed the retrieve, it will gently but firmly hold the bird until commanded to release it to the handler&#x27;s hand. Delivery to hand reduces the risk of a crippled bird escaping, as the bird remains in the dog&#x27;s mouth until the handler takes hold of it.
* Honoring: When hunting with multiple dogs, a retriever should remain under control while other dogs work, and wait its turn. This is important because having multiple dogs retrieving game simultaneously can cause confusion. This is one reason why many handlers use the dog&#x27;s name as the command to retrieve.
* Shake on command: Following a retrieve, a well-trained dog will not shake off excess water from its fur until after the delivery is complete. A dog shaking water from its fur in a small boat at worst risks capsizing the craft in cold winter conditions and at best will most likely shower hunters and equipment. Also, a dog shaking while still holding the game in its mouth could damage the bird to the point of making it unfit for the table. To avoid these mishaps, trainers use a distinct command releasing a dog to shake.
* Quarter: Retrievers are often used in a secondary role as an upland flushing dog. Dogs must work in a pattern in front of the hunter seeking upland game birds. The retriever must be taught to stay within gun range to avoid flushing a bird outside of shooting distance.
* Remain steady to wing and shot: When hunting upland birds, the flushing dog should be steady to wing and shot, meaning it sits when a bird rises or a gun is fired. It does this to mark the fall and to avoid flushing other birds by unnecessarily pursuing a missed bird.

Although most individual retrievers have the raw capacity to be trained to perform as a gun dog, a significant amount of thought and effort is given to breeding in specific desired traits into dogs from field bred lines that greatly enhance the training process. When breeding retrievers for field work, extensive consideration is given to:

* Biddableness: Because producing a well-trained retriever capable of performing the tasks outlined above requires a significant amount of time and effort, an intelligent, controllable, and open-to-learning (biddable) retriever is of utmost importance.
* Desire and drive: These traits covers a broad range of behaviors exhibited by the “good retriever”. Most notably, they demonstrate the desire to retrieve almost to the point of manic behavior and take on significant obstacles to make a retrieve. They also demonstrate an exceptional interest in birds, bird feathers, and bird scent, which is termed “birdiness”.
* Marking and memory: Eyesight and depth perception are of paramount importance to a dog&#x27;s ability to mark downed game. Remembering each fall is also critical. While retriever trainers use special techniques to help a dog to mark and remember downed game, a good retriever is born with these “raw tools”.
* Nose: Dogs are led primarily by their nose. A good retriever uses its nose to find downed game in heavy cover and while quartering a field to locate and flush upland game birds.
* Soft mouth: A soft-mouthed dog is needed to ensure retrieved game is fit for the table. A soft-mouthed dog picks up and holds game softly but firmly on the retrieve. Dogs that unnecessarily drop birds, crunch on, chew, or even eat the bird before delivery to the handler are considered “hard-mouthed” or are described as having “mouth problems”. While training can overcome most “mouth problems”, a dog with an inherently soft mouth is more desirable when starting the training process.
* Hardiness: Waterfowl hunting is a cold-weather sport undertaken across a wide variety of locations and conditions, from thick, flooded timber in the south US, to icy and ice-covered ponds in the Midwest to frigid seas along upper the New England coast. A good retriever willingly re-enters the water and makes multiple retrieves under these and other extreme conditions.

== Lifespan ==
The average lifespan of a retriever is about 10–12 years. Some may live up to 15 years.

== Retriever breeds ==
* Chesapeake Bay Retriever
* Curly Coated Retriever
* Flat Coated Retriever
* Golden Retriever
* Labrador Retriever 
* Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever

<text>PMQ (formerly, Police Married Quarters) is the historic site of the old Hollywood Road Police Married Quarters, which is now a mixed-use arts and design venue in Hong Kong, between Aberdeen Street, Staunton Street, Hollywood Road, and Shing Wong Street. 

The site occupies what was originally the grounds of Queen&#x27;s College, which was built on the site in 1889. After damage during World War II, it was repurposed as quarters for married junior policemen. The compound has been listed as a Grade III historic building since 2010. In 2014, after nearly 15 years of disuse, it was renamed PMQ and opened to the public. Its residential units were turned into exhibitions spaces, studios, shops and offices for creative enterprises. 

==History==
The Central Government School was built on Gough Street in 1862 and was the first government primary and secondary school in Hong Kong which provided Western education to the public. In 1889, due to the increasing number of students, the school relocated to a new campus on Hollywood Road. Later on the school was renamed &#x27;Victoria College&#x27;, then Queen&#x27;s College in 1894. At that time, the school was one of the largest and most expensive buildings in Hong Kong. Many local leaders and talent were nurtured at this school, including the Father of Modern China, Dr Sun Yat-sen, and business tycoons such as Sir Robert Ho Tung. However, during the Japanese occupation in 1941, the building was destroyed. In 1948, the remaining building was demolished. In 1951, in order to increase police recruitment in response to the influx of Chinese immigrants after the Chinese Civil War, PMQ provided 140 single room units and 28 double room units for the rank and file officers serving at the nearby Central Police Station. Former Hong Kong Chief Executives C.Y. Leung and Donald Tsang have both lived there. In 2000, the building was emptied. In 2009, the &#x27;Conserving Central&#x27; project mentioned in the Policy Address that eight heritage sites in Central including PMQ should be renovated. In April 2014, PMQ started to operate as a creative hub.

==Features==

The original site area was around 6,000 square meters. After the revitalization, the total floor areas became 18,000 square meters. Because the location is near galleries and boutiques along Hollywood Road and SoHo, it was successful in attracting around 100 design galleries, shops, bookstores and office units. Moreover, there are 15 ‘pop- up’ units for design exhibitions and outlets. The 1,000-square-meter central courtyard has held events like &quot;Panda-mania&quot; in 2014, with 1,600 paper versions of the endangered animal. To promote the historic background of PMQ, a tunnel allows visitors to go through the foundation of the former Victoria College.

==Conservation policy==

Between 2005 and 2007, the Antiquities and Monuments Office (AMO) investigated the remnants of PMQ. They found the remains of the Central School, including granite shafts and plinths of the boundary walls and the retaining wall; the quoin stones at the corners of the site; and the steps. The AMO rated PMQ as Grade III Historic Building in 2010.

In 2008, the government underwent a public engagement exercise on PMQ. In response, the government based revitalisation plans on six principles: 

*Preserve historic relics
*Emphasize the cultural and historical value and the original ambience
*Give it a new lease of life by gathering creative industries to make it a landmark for local residents and visitors
*Contribute to the urban planning along Hollywood Road and the surrounding area on the proposed ‘spot, line and area’ heritage conservation methods
*Respond to community concerns about the development density and the building height
*Fulfill community expectations of having more public space

==Architecture==


PMQ consists of two, seven-storey blocks of the former Hollywood
Road Police Married Quarters, named Stauton and Hollywood, and the former Central Junior Police Call Clubhouse. The former clubhouse now houses restaurants. One additional feature, named &#x27;QUBE&#x27;, was added as the linkage between the two blocks, with a rooftop garden called &#x27;PLATEAU&#x27; on the fourth floor.

Some modern designs were deployed, such as a UV-protective glass ceiling. 

Heritage can be found in the main entrance of the quarters. The granite steps and rubble retaining wall, entrance at Staunton Street were from the Central school. Guests can take the free Underground Interpretation Area Walk-in Tour or the PMQ Heritage Interpretation Guided Tour. 

==Special events==
PMQ organizes free arts programs, events and workshops every month. 

One special event is the monthly night market, which is divided into three parts: live band show, product design and food stalls. 

Some international exhibitions are held in PMQ also. Previously, there were an international exhibition called “1600 Pandas” organized by WWF. In order to raise people&#x27;s awareness of protecting the environment, the exhibition displayed 1600 paper-made pandas.
