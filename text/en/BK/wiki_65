<text>Jay Campbell Buhner (born August 13, 1964), nicknamed &quot;Bone&quot;, is an American former professional baseball right fielder. He played for the New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball from 1987 to 2001. Noted for his shaved head, thick goatee, and patch of pine tar on the right hip of his uniform, he is regarded as one of the most popular players in Mariners&#x27; history.

==Early life==
Born in Louisville, Kentucky, Buhner was raised in Texas and attended Clear Creek High School in League City, southeast of Houston, where he played baseball under coach Jim Mallory. His nickname, &quot;Bone&quot;, came after an incident where Buhner lost a ball in the lights. The ball hit him in the skull, but he shook it off. Mallory came out to see if Buhner was OK and commented it was a good thing Buhner had such a bony head, and the name stuck.

Buhner graduated from high school in 1982 and played college baseball at McLennan Community College in Waco. In his freshman season in 1983, the Highlanders made their fourth consecutive trip to the junior college world series in Grand Junction, Colorado, and won their first national title. He was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the ninth round (230th overall) of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft, but opted not to sign.

==Professional career==
===Pittsburgh Pirates (1984)===
During his sophomore year, in January 1984, Buhner was taken in the second round of the secondary phase of the free-agent draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates. He signed in late May and played the 1984 season for the short season Single-A Watertown Pirates in the New York–Penn League, batting .323 with nine home runs and 58 RBI in 65 games.

===New York Yankees (1985–1988)===
====Minor leagues====
On December 20, 1984, Buhner was traded to the New York Yankees with infielder Dale Berra as part of a five-player deal for outfielder Steve Kemp and shortstop Tim Foli, a former Pirate. He played the next two seasons in the Class-A Florida State League with the Fort Lauderdale Yankees, then moved up to Triple-A in 1987 with the Columbus Clippers in the International League. In 134 games with the Clippers, Buhner hit .279 with 31 home runs and 85 RBI. Managed by Bucky Dent, Columbus finished second in the regular season, but swept both series in the four-team playoffs to take the league title and Governors&#x27; Cup.

====Major leagues====
When the minor league playoffs concluded, Buhner was recalled by the Yankees on September 10, 1987. He made his major league debut the next night, finishing the game 0-for-4 with an RBI in a 6–5 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. Buhner appeared in seven games with the Yankees to close out the year, batting .227 with two doubles and one RBI. In 1988, Buhner was back and forth between Columbus and New York. In a partial season with the Yankees he hit .188 with three home runs and 13 RBI in 25 games.

===Seattle Mariners (1988–2001)===
On July 21, 1988, the Yankees traded Buhner, along with career minor leaguers Rich Balabon and Troy Evers, to the Seattle Mariners for designated hitter Ken Phelps. Buhner played in 60 games with the Mariners to finish the season, batting .224 with 10 home runs and 25 RBI. He then split the next two seasons between the Mariners and their Triple-A affiliate, the Calgary Cannons.

Buhner&#x27;s career began an upwards turn in 1991, as he finished the season batting .244 with 27 home runs with 77 RBI in 137 games. On July 25, 1991, Buhner hit a massive 457-foot home run in Seattle&#x27;s 6–5 win against his former team, the Yankees, at Yankee Stadium. He would go on to have continued success against the Yankees throughout his career. In an extra-inning home game against the Oakland Athletics on June 23, 1993, he became the first Mariner to hit for the cycle. Buhner began his cycle with a grand slam in the first inning, and hit a triple in the 14th inning to complete it. He subsequently scored the winning run on a wild pitch. Buhner became a free agent following the 1994 season and was pursued by the Baltimore Orioles, but he chose to remain in Seattle, signing a three-year, $15.5 million contract on December 21, 1994.

In 1995, Buhner had a career season, batting .262 with 40 home runs and 121 RBI in just 126 games, helping the Mariners to their first American League West title. In the 1995 American League Division Series (ALDS) against the Yankees, Buhner batted .458 with a hit in every game, including three games with at least three hits. In Game 4, he hit his first career postseason home run capping off a five-run eighth inning in Seattle&#x27;s 11–8 win. He finished the game 3-for-4 with two runs scored, an RBI and a walk. The Mariners went on to defeat the Yankees in Game 5 and advanced to the 1995 American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians. In Game 3 of the series, Buhner hit two home runs, including the game-winning three-run home run in the 11th inning against reliever Eric Plunk to give Seattle a 5–2 win and a 2–1 series lead. The Mariners, however, would lose the next three games, ending their season. Buhner played in all 11 of Seattle&#x27;s postseason games, batting .383 with four home runs and 8 RBI. After the season, he finished fifth in American League Most Valuable Player voting.

Buhner had continued success in 1996, finishing with a .271 average and setting career-highs with 44 home runs and 138 RBI in 150 games. His 159 strikeouts also led the American League. On July 2, Buhner was selected to the All-Star Game for the only time in his career. On August 3, he hit his 200th career home run in Seattle&#x27;s 9–3 win over the Detroit Tigers. At the end of the season, Buhner won his first career Gold Glove Award.

On February 7, 1997, Buhner signed a two-year, $13 million extension with the Mariners, keeping him in Seattle through 1999. On September 24 against the Anaheim Angels, Buhner hit a 484-foot, three-run home run for his 40th home run of the season, giving the 1997 Mariners the single-season record for home runs by a team with 258. The Mariners went on to win the game, 4–3, giving them the AL West division title. In 157 games, Buhner hit .243 with 40 home runs and 109 RBI while striking out 175 times to lead the majors. In the 1997 ALDS, Buhner homered in Games 1 and 3, but hit just .231 in the series as the Mariners lost to the Baltimore Orioles in four games.

On April 6, 1998, Buhner injured his left knee while making a sliding catch in a game against the Yankees, causing him to undergo surgery. After missing two months, he returned to the Mariners lineup on June 11. He was limited to 72 games, and finished the season batting .242 with 15 home runs and 45 RBI. After the season, he underwent surgery on his right elbow, but returned in time for the start of the 1999 season.

Buhner was again limited by injury in 1999, missing nearly two months on the disabled list with a strained left hamstring. In 87 games, he hit just .222 with 14 home runs and 38 RBI. His .388 on-base percentage (OBP) was second on the team behind Edgar Martínez. On December 6, 1999, Buhner signed a one-year deal to return to the Mariners in 2000. On July 25, 2000, Buhner hit his 300th career home run against the Oakland Athletics. He went on to play in 112 games in 2000, batting .253 with 26 home runs and 82 RBI.

On December 7, 2000, Buhner signed another one-year contract with the Mariners for the 2001 season. However, he did not play for the team in spring training due to plantar fasciitis in his left foot and began the season on the disabled list. He returned on September 1, and played out the last month of the season, batting .222 with two home runs and 5 RBI in 19 games.

While well known for his tendency to strike out, Buhner also developed a patience at the plate which allowed him to walk 100 times in a season twice (1993 and 1997) and to post a career OBP of .359. By the mid-1990s, he had developed into one of the premier offensive players in the game, hitting over 40 home runs in three consecutive seasons (1995, 1996, and 1997), becoming just the tenth player to do so (and the first since Frank Howard in 1970).

==Retirement and legacy==

===Mariners legacy===
After a 116-win 2001 season, Buhner retired at age 37 in December of that year.

During his career, the Mariners hosted a popular promotion, &quot;Buhner Buzz Night&quot;, where visitors would receive free admission in the right field seats if they had a shaved head. Free buzz cuts were provided for people who showed up with hair. Buhner himself participated in giving fans of all ages buzz cuts, which also included women. The club revived the promotion for its 30th anniversary in 2024, with Buhner giving catcher Cal Raleigh a buzz cut.

George Thorogood&#x27;s song &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; was used as Buhner&#x27;s at-bat music during home games. 

Although Buhner&#x27;s jersey number 19 has not been issued since, it has not been officially retired, per the team&#x27;s policy regarding retired numbers. The Mariners require a player to have spent at least five years with the team and be elected to the Hall of Fame or narrowly miss election after spending substantially his entire career with the team. 

Buhner holds the Mariners&#x27; career record for strikeouts with 1,375 and is in the top 10 in many offensive categories. He ranks fifth in games played for the team. He also has the lowest career stolen base percentage of any MLB player since 1954 with at least four stolen bases: he stole six stolen bases and was caught stealing 24 times for a success rate of 20 percent. (Caught stealing counts are not complete until the 1954 season, when Major League Baseball began maintaining official records.)

===1988 trade and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;===
Buhner&#x27;s July 1988 trade from the Yankees to the Mariners, often considered one of the Yankees&#x27; worst and one of the Mariners&#x27; best trades in baseball history, was referenced on the television sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in the January 1996 episode &quot;The Caddy&quot;. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner appears at the home of George Costanza&#x27;s parents to mistakenly inform them that their son is dead. The only response from Frank Costanza (played by Jerry Stiller) is, &quot;What the hell did you trade Jay Buhner for?! He had 30 home runs, over 100 RBIs last year! He&#x27;s got a rocket for an arm… You don&#x27;t know what the hell you&#x27;re doing!&quot; (Steinbrenner, voiced by Larry David, replies, &quot;Well, Buhner was a good prospect, no question about it. But my baseball people love Ken Phelps&#x27;s bat. They kept saying, &#x27;Ken Phelps! Ken Phelps!&#x27;&quot;) The clip was played at Safeco Field when Buhner was inducted into the Mariners&#x27; Hall of Fame in August 2004.

=== Popularity in music ===
Buhner is the namesake of Korean-American k-pop idol, Jay Park, from the group Enhypen. He is referenced by Action Bronson in the song &quot;Red Dot Music&quot; by Mac Miller, where Bronson references their similarly shaved heads saying &quot;my look is Jay Buhner.&quot;

==Personal life==
Buhner and his family remained in the Seattle area, in Sammamish, following his playing career. His son, Gunnar, played baseball for Lewis–Clark State College, for the Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; Gulf Coast League team in 2017, and in independent baseball until 2022.

<doc id="385925" wikidata="Q452447" url="?curid=385925" title="Pulaski Skyway">
<text>The Pulaski Skyway is a four-lane bridge-causeway in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey, carrying a freeway designated U.S. Route 1/9 (US 1/9) for most of its length. The structure has a total length of . Its longest bridge spans . Traveling between Newark and Jersey City, the roadway crosses the Passaic and Hackensack rivers, Kearny Point, the peninsula between them, and the New Jersey Meadowlands.

Designed by Sigvald Johannesson, the General Casimir Pulaski Skyway opened in 1932 as the last part of the Route 1 Extension, one of the first freeways or &quot;super-highways&quot; in the United States, to provide a connection to the Holland Tunnel. One of several major projects built during the reign of Hudson County political boss Frank Hague, its construction was a source of political and labor disputes. The viaduct is listed in the state and federal registers of historic places.

Unpredictable traffic congestion and its functionally obsolete design make the Skyway one of the most unreliable roads in the United States. , the bridges handle about 74,000 crossings per day, none of which were by trucks since they had been barred from the road in 1934. The bridges have been altered little since opening. In 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) began a rehabilitation program, which it estimated would cost more than $1 billion and required intermittent closures. The Skyway was closed to eastbound traffic from 2014 to 2018.

== Description ==

Sources differ on the length and terminal points of the skyway, which was built as part of the long Route 1 Extension. The National Bridge Inventory identifies the Hudson County section as long and the Essex County section as . In a historic roadway and bridge study for NJDOT, it was described as long. NJDOT has indicated the overall length of the bridge structures to be and identified the Hudson County section as long. Other sources, along with the National Register of Historic Places, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;, describe it as being long.

The four-lane skyway carries the US 1/9 concurrency for most its length, and a short section of Route 139 for the rest. While the skyway generally runs east–west between Newark and Jersey City, US 1 and US 9 are generally north–south routes. The west end of the skyway begins as US 1/9 roadway ascends and passes over Raymond Boulevard in Newark&#x27;s Ironbound neighborhood. At Tonnele Circle, US 1/9 exits to grade and follows Tonnele Avenue north towards the Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge as Route 139 begins on the skyway, over the traffic circle. While the road continues to the Holland Tunnel, the skyway soon comes to its eastern end at a cut in Bergen Hill, just west of John F. Kennedy Boulevard, where Route 139 runs under the viaduct of Route 139U (the upper level). In addition to crossing the Hackensack and the Passaic, the skyway also passes over, not under, the Chaplain Washington-Harry Laderman Bridges and the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95), with which it has no interchange. Under most of the skyway in Newark is other vehicular, rail, maritime, and industrial infrastructure built on landfilled wetlands of the New Jersey Meadowlands.

Some maps, including one of Newark (1938) and one of Elizabeth (1967), labeled the US 1/9 southern approach starting north of Newark Airport as the Pulaski Skyway. An NJDOT single line diagram (2010) shows the General Pulaski Skyway starting at mile post 49.00 of U.S. 1/9, which is just north of the renamed Newark Liberty International Airport. Google Maps includes the Route 139 eastern approach.

There is limited intermediate access to the skyway: two single-lane ramps rise to the inner lanes of the elevated structure, requiring traffic to enter or exit from the left providing access at the Marion Section (southbound entrance and northbound exit only) of Jersey City and South Kearny (northbound entrance and southbound exit only).

Trucks have been prohibited for the &quot;safety and welfare of the public&quot; since 1934 because of the state&#x27;s approval of a local ordinance that was championed by Frank Hague, mayor of Jersey City. They are detoured to use U.S. Route 1/9 Truck, along the route of the Lincoln Highway that carried traffic before the skyway&#x27;s construction. Pedestrians and cyclists cannot use the road as there are no dedicated bicycle lanes or sidewalks. The speed limit on the skyway is , but is generally not enforceable as there is nowhere for police to pull over speeders because of the absence of shoulders.

In 2011, the Texas Transportation Institute determined that the Skyway was the sixth-most unreliable road in the United States because of the unpredictability of traffic congestion and therefore travel times.

== Design and construction ==
Except for crossings over Jersey City rail lines and the Hackensack and the Passaic, the main part of the skyway is a steel deck truss cantilever bridge, supported by concrete piers. Each of the two river crossings is a combination of a subdivided (K-shaped) through Pratt truss between the supports and a basic Pratt truss structure connecting each end to the deck truss part of the skyway. Spanning the rivers, they reach a clearance height of . In Jersey City, three short Pratt through truss spans take the roadway over rail lines, the westernmost passing over the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) rapid transit line and the Conrail Passaic and Harsimus Line. The two easternmost Pratt through truss spans are in the vicinity of Marion Junction, one of which passes over the Marion Running Track, to the east of which the skyway is low enough to use simple vertical supports.

Design began in 1919 for the Holland Tunnel, the first fixed roadway connection between New Jersey and New York City; construction began in 1922, and the tunnel opened in late 1927. To provide for a continuous highway connection on the New Jersey side, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill in 1922 authorizing the extension of Route 1 from its end at Elizabeth through Newark and Jersey City to the proposed tunnel. It was conceived as the nation&#x27;s first &quot;super-highway&quot;. State highway engineer Hugh L. Sloan appointed old acquaintance Fred Lavis, a consulting engineer who had worked on foreign rail lines and the Panama Canal and written four books on locating and designing rail lines, to design this Route 1 Extension. Sigvald Johannesson designed the Skyway portion.

Frank Hague, mayor of Jersey City and boss of the state&#x27;s political machine, directed the state to avoid the open cuts that were already common where the railroads crossed Bergen Hill, and to include an access ramp in Kearny to spur industrial development. Construction of the highway, which was mostly raised on embankments and passed through Bergen Hill in a cut, began in mid-1925. The two major eastern and western sections in Jersey City and Newark—including the viaduct leading to the &quot;covered roadway&quot; (Route 139) and the embankments in eastern Newark—were opened on December 16, 1928, about a year after the tunnel opened. Traffic was still required to use the Lincoln Highway to cross the Hackensack and the Passaic on the since-replaced drawbridges that frequently stopped traffic to allow ships to pass.
Lavis&#x27;s design for the final viaduct passageway, which would be raised on concrete piers across the Meadowlands, included two vertical-lift bridges above the Passaic and Hackensack rivers, sufficient for the majority of ships to pass underneath. He resigned in 1928, believing his task was complete, but in January 1929 the War Department objected to the continued existence of the Lincoln Highway bridges once the skyway was complete. Since the Route 1 Extension was not intended for local traffic, and replacing the vertical-lift bridges with tunnels would have been expensive, a compromise was worked out by late 1929 to raise the river bridges to while allowing the Lincoln Highway drawbridges to remain in place. The concrete jacketing of the steel was removed from the plans since it would make the taller fixed bridges heavier. This resulted in more maintenance.

Four companies—the American Bridge Company, McClintic-Marshall Company, Phoenix Bridge Company, and Taylor-Fichter Steel Construction Company—were awarded contracts for the so-called &quot;Diagonal Highway&quot;, with construction to start in April 1930. The two river bridges, McClintic-Marshall&#x27;s portion, were completed first, and the $21 million road was opened at 8:00 a.m. on November 24, 1932, after an official ceremony the previous day on the Kearny ramp. Owing to the Great Depression and problems with funding, Governor A. Harry Moore directed the Highway Commission on October 25, 1932 to make a formal request to the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads to charge tolls on the Diagonal Highway. It was thought that tolls would be illegal because of the use of $600,000 of federal aid to build the road, but that it might be possible to transfer this funding to other projects. A bill was introduced into the state legislature on May 1, 1933, to add tolls to the road (then known as the &quot;sky way&quot;), at a rate of 10 cents for cars and 20 cents for trucks. The legal obstacle to federal aid was resolved by gaining approval to transfer the funds.
During planning and construction, and for about half a year after opening, the road had no official name and was known as the Diagonal Highway, Newark–Jersey City Viaduct, or High-Level Viaduct. On May 3, 1933, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Eugene W. Hejke of Jersey City naming the road the General Casimir Pulaski Memorial Skyway after Casimir Pulaski, the Polish military leader who helped train and lead Continental Army troops in the American Revolutionary War. An official ceremony was held on October 11, 1933, including the unveiling of signs with an abbreviated designation, Gen. Pulaski Skyway.

Surveys taken during 1932 and 1933 proved that the skyway saved time on the new and old routes. Not only was the distance shortened by , but it took at least six minutes less to travel the new route during regular traffic. Trucks gained even more time, saving anywhere from five to eleven minutes. During times of previous traffic congestion on weekends on the old route, the viaduct saved around 25 minutes or more from the elimination of traffic congestion. In addition, the new route did not have the much longer delays and traffic back-ups that were caused whenever the bridges on the old highway were opened. It was found that the skyway also diverted a good deal of traffic from other routes.

== Labor issues ==
Pulaski Skyway construction ended up causing a dispute between Mayor of Jersey City Frank Hague, who ran a statewide political machine, and Theodore M. Brandle, a &quot;labor czar&quot; allied with Hague. Brandle and Hague had become friends through Hague&#x27;s efforts to get approval of unions. Brandle helped organize Branleygran Company, a construction bond underwriter, which Hague channeled construction projects towards. During the mid-1920s redevelopment of Journal Square, Brandle&#x27;s Labor National Bank, founded in June 1926, acquired a new 15-story headquarters, the Labor Bank Building. Essentially Brandle controlled any construction projects in northern New Jersey, and any strikes he might call would be backed by Hague&#x27;s police.

The relationship between Hague and Brandle started to go bad in late 1931, during construction of Jersey City Medical Center, an important project to Hague. Leo Brennan, a contractor approved by Hague without consulting Brandle, who was building a backup power station for the hospital, refused to work with Brandle&#x27;s card-file system, by which he kept track of union members and blacklisted those whom he disliked. The annoyed Brandle called a strike, but Brennan&#x27;s workers refused; the police shut down the site after a brawl, but Brennan got court approval to continue. To placate Brandle, who threatened a strike that would stop all construction work on the center, Hague paid off Brennan and hired another contractor that Brandle had approved.

For the construction of the Pulaski Skyway, which began in April 1930, Hague chose four members of the National Erectors&#x27; Association, an organization of &quot;open shop&quot; (non-union) steel contractors. Performance bonds were paid in cash, bypassing Branleygran, and the companies hired Foster&#x27;s Industrial and Detective Bureau to guard the site against Brandle&#x27;s threat to &quot;unionize this job or else&quot;. Brandle organized picket lines of loyal union men, and the two sides frequently fought in the streets or in the work area. Brandle&#x27;s sole victory was a five-day stoppage in July 1931 by 165 non-union workers, who were interested in higher pay and afraid of the ongoing fights, but decided against joining the union. During the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee hearings, it was discovered that, in order to save about $50,000 in salary, the American Bridge Company, one of the four contractors, spent almost $300,000 on keeping its &quot;open shop&quot;.
The first casualty of the labor battle was a picketer, shot and temporarily paralyzed by a perimeter guard on November 14, 1931, for throwing stones at workers. Several months later, on February 27, 1932, a car carrying six workers to the construction site was surrounded by union men, who began to beat them with iron bars. One of the workers, William T. Harrison, was dead by the next morning; Hague broke all ties with Brandle and ordered the police to &quot;wage relentless war against the Brandle gang-rioters&quot;. In April 1932, 21 ironworkers were indicted as suspects in the Harrison murder. The trial was held on December 6, 1932, two weeks after the completion of the skyway. Every defendant was found not guilty, since county prosecutor John Drewen was unable to place any of them at the scene of the crime, and witnesses and defendants testified that they had been forced under torture or the threat of prosecution to sign affidavits and confessions. In addition to William T. Harrison&#x27;s death, 14 lives were claimed by work-related accidents during construction.

Hague refused to allow Brandle and the unions to win, and began to force unions to foreclose through his control of the courts. On the public side, Hague attacked the &quot;labor racketeers&quot; with words, and the local newspapers gladly went along. In 1937 and 1938, Hague turned Jersey City into a police state to fight the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which was trying to inform workers of their rights under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act. Socialist Norman Thomas was prevented from speaking in Jersey City and Newark by Hague and his friends. This and other similar cases turned the national spotlight on Hague, and he was attacked by the &quot;New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; in early 1938. Finally, in 1947, Governor Alfred E. Driscoll cut off Hague&#x27;s judicial power, and the mayor retired.

== Truck and other safety issues ==

The slippery concrete surfacing, steep left-side ramps, center breakdown lane, and wide-open alignment built for high speeds all contributed to a high number of crashes. Jersey City Mayor Frank Hague passed an ordinance in November 1933 banning trucks from its section of the skyway, which effectively banned them from the whole road. Enforcement began on January 15, 1934, when Jersey City police began arresting truck drivers using the skyway. The New Jersey State Highway Commission approved the ban on January 23.

As a result of controversy caused by the ban, 300,000 ballots were distributed on February 6 to motorists on the skyway, asking whether trucks should be banned. Mayor Hague promised to go with the majority, which agreed with the ban. The matter was also taken to court, with one of the convicted truck drivers arguing that the ban was an unreasonable restraint of interstate commerce, and that since the federal government contributed money towards the road, Jersey City lacked the power to ban trucks. On August 14, Justice Thomas W. Trenchard of the New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the ban, stating that &quot;the court is not at liberty to substitute its judgment for that of the municipality&#x27;s as to the best and most feasible manner of curing traffic evils and traffic congestion where such regulation bears a direct relationship to public safety and is reasonable and not arbitrary.&quot; The Tonnele Circle Viaduct, a new offramp allowing westbound trucks from the Holland Tunnel to bypass Tonnele Circle to southbound US 1/9 Truck, which now also leads to Interstate 280 (I-280), opened on September 14, 1938. The Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-78) opened in September 1956, allowing trucks to bypass the old surface road, US 1/9 Truck.

On May 21, 1952, large numbers of trucks were spotted by Jersey City police entering the city on the skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they were told that the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, since there was no state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.
When the skyway first opened, it carried five lanes; the center one was intended as a breakdown lane, but was used as a &quot;suicide lane&quot; for passing slower traffic. By the 1950s, the skyway was seeing over 400 crashes per year; an aluminum median barrier was added in mid-1956, in addition to a new pavement coating designed to make the road less slippery.
The skyway was a constraint in the building of the New Jersey Turnpike in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby Passaic River. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway&#x27;s trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the turnpike bridge by , without shutting it to traffic.

== Rehabilitation ==
By the 2000s, the Pulaski Skyway was considered functionally obsolete since its design did not meet highway bridge standards. In 2007, it was rated structurally deficient. The 2007 collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis raised concerns about the stability of the skyway, which was one of eight New Jersey bridges with similar design features. Within days of the collapse, NJDOT announced that it would start a previously planned one-year, $10-million project to make critical repairs. The work was the first phase of a planned 10-year, $200-million interim renovation project, and marked the skyway&#x27;s first significant repairs since 1984.

After work began, it was determined that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2 billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that it would take a decade before the state could afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region&#x27;s Core rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8 billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and Route 139, replace Wittpenn Bridge, and extend US 1/9 Truck, all part of the larger distribution network in the Port of New York and New Jersey.

In January 2013, NJDOT announced that work on the $335 million projects for repaving and restoration of the roadway would begin at the end of 2013 by the state owned China Construction America Company. To facilitate the work, the eastbound lanes (northbound US 1/9) would close for two years after the Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014 at the nearby Meadowlands Sports Complex. The proposal was opposed by local politicians, who contended that it did not satisfactorily address the effect on local traffic and called for more thorough investigation into alternatives. The closure date was postponed by NJDOT to more completely work out comprehensive traffic and travel options.

The roadway remained open through the use of alternate lane closures during the work until April 12, 2014, affecting the 74,000 daily crossings. The rehabilitation project, with an estimated cost of $1.2–1.5 billion, is being done in phases and spread out over ten contracts, the first of which began in 2012, and the last, for final painting of the steel structure, planned for completion in 2020. The improvements are expected to extend the life of the bridge until at least 2095.
The skyway was closed for eastbound (northbound US 1/9) traffic on April 12, 2014, for two years in order to replace the entire bridge deck. The midway access ramps in South Kearny and Jersey City were closed to regular traffic, but would be available to emergency responders. In April 2015, NJDOT said that unforeseen additional repairs would be made, extending the scheduled April 2016 completion date to sometime later that year and adding $14 million in costs. In March 2018, after several construction delays, it was announced that the Pulaski Skyway was set to be reopened to all traffic that spring. The skyway reopened to all traffic on June 30, 2018, two days earlier than NJDOT had originally announced. Auxiliary projects, such as rehabilitation of ramps onto the skyway and reconstruction of Route 139, are expected to continue at least through 2026.

=== Travel alternatives ===
NJDOT worked with New Jersey Transit (NJT) to bolster public transportation, encouraged car and van pooling, worked with local community officials, employers, truckers, local port employees, and the public to alleviate problems and address flexible working hours, and publicized alternate transportation options through television, radio, social media, news media, and its skyway website.

To ease congestion, the Turnpike Authority converted a shoulder of the Newark Bay-Hudson County Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike to a traveling lane. Temporary lane control lights on of the extension would indicate that extra lane is open during peak hours, at which time the speed limit would be reduced. This set-up would be able to handle 1,900 vehicles an hour in addition to the slightly more than 4,000 vehicles per hour on the existing lanes during peak periods. To reduce delays, variable message signs would provide motorists with daily traffic alerts and an adaptive traffic signal system would be installed and monitored by the Meadowlands Commission to synchronize traffic lights at 15 intersections along US 1/9 Truck and Route 440 in Kearny Point and Jersey City. They are part of a larger &quot;intelligent transportation system&quot;, the Meadowlands Adaptive Signal System, a network of traffic-controlled intersections with vehicle detectors in the Meadowlands. In anticipation of traffic overflow onto local Jersey City streets, off-duty police officers would be hired to direct traffic heading to the Holland Tunnel during rush hours.

To promote public transportation, NJT and PATH offered more frequent peak hour train services to Newark, Hoboken and Jersey City on the Hudson Waterfront, and Manhattan. NJT added a new bus route for peak hour service between Watchung and Newark Penn Station, along the US 22 corridor, and their bus schedules accommodated additional passengers on existing routes.

=== Funding controversy ===
On June 12, 2014, the PANYNJ acknowledged that the Securities and Exchange Commission, New York County District Attorney, and United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey were investigating its diversion of $1.8 billion to fund the Pulaski Skyway and other New Jersey roadway rehabilitation projects. These inquiries were related to how this funding, which was made at the urging of the Christie administration, was potentially misrepresented in documents related to bond sales. State laws require the PANYNJ to spend money only related to its own facilities, unless it gets approval from lawmakers in New Jersey and New York. The PANYNJ documents state that the Pulaski Skyway was designated as also providing access to the Lincoln Tunnel, even though it is miles from the tunnel and does not connect to it directly. In December 2014, United Airlines filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration that claims that since 2004 the PANYNJ has diverted more than $2 billion from the metro area airports to non-airport uses and that in 2014 alone it spent $181 million to repair the Pulaski Skyway and $60 million on the Wittpenn Bridge, NJDOT-owned and -operated structures.

== In popular culture ==
The Pulaski Skyway is the subject of &quot;The Last Three Miles&quot;, a book written by Steven Hart published in 2007. The Skyway has been used in radio, film, television, and at least one video game. In the 1938 radio drama &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, one of the Martian machines straddles the skyway (a scene replicated in the 2005 film wherein the first machine appears in the shadow of the bridge). It was featured in the 1979 film &quot;Hair&quot;. Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1943 film &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; and the 1999–2007 television drama &quot;The Sopranos&quot; include shots of the bridge in the opening montages. Clutch included the track &quot;Pulaski Skyway&quot; on its 2005 release &quot;Robot Hive/Exodus.&quot;

<text>The ALCO Century Series locomotives were a line of road switcher locomotives produced by Alco, the Montreal Locomotive Works and AE Goodwin under license in Australia.

Production of the Century Series began in 1963 and ended in 1972. MLW and Goodwin continued to build Century locomotives after Alco ended locomotive production and shut down in early 1969. A total of 841 locomotives, in eleven variants, were produced over the ten years of production.

==Background and development==
During the 1950s, EMD had become the major player in the North American diesel locomotive market, with Alco relegated to second place. This was largely due to its 244 diesel engine suffering from significant reliability issues. In response to these issues a new engine design, the ALCO 251, was approved for development in 1951. This engine was put through nearly five years of testing before entering domestic production in four sizes (, , , and ) in a new line of locomotives.

By 1956 General Electric had launched its first Universal Series road locomotives primarily as export units. The U25B followed in 1961 and rapidly propelled GE into second place in the locomotive market, behind EMD.

Faced with this market situation, Alco in 1962 completely redesigned its road locomotive line, creating what would become the Century Series. The locomotives were designed to equal and surpass competitors&#x27; products in terms of both features and performance. To meet that end, the new locomotives included, among other features, a redesign of the air system, an improved traction control system, and improved accessibility and maintainability.

The series was first introduced on January 29, 1963, in Chicago, Illinois, consisting of three locomotives, the 2,000-horsepower B-B model C420, 2,400-horsepower B-B model C424, and the 2,400-horsepower C-C model C624, which was subsequently abandoned in favor of a more powerful model, the 2,750-horsepower C628. During speeches at the event, Alco executives promoted the new locomotives&#x27; reduced operating costs, a major effort in the design of the machines. Combined with unit reduction through higher powered locomotives, as well as liberal trade-in terms, Alco claimed operating cost could be reduced as much as 44%.

==Production models==
===C420===
The C420 was one of the first models launched, and was powered by a 2,000-horsepower, 12-cylinder, Model 251C engine. It was launched at the inaugural event for the Century series in 1963, and remained in production until 1968. A total of 131 units were built, including 22 passenger models for the Long Island Rail Road in 1963, supplemented in 1968 by an additional order of eight more with Alco&#x27;s Hi-Ad trucks.

===C424===
The C424 was another of the initial models launched, and was powered by a 2,400-horsepower, 16-cylinder, Model 251B engine. It remained in production until 1967. A total of 190 units were built, although only 53 went to domestic customers; the remainder went to Mexican or Canadian customers.

===C628===
The C628 was intended as a replacement for the C624, announced at the Chicago launch event, but never produced due to being made rapidly obsolete by improvements in engine technology. The C628 was powered by a 2,750-horsepower, 16-cylinder, Model 251C engine. It was launched in 1963, and remained in production until 1968. A total of 186 units were produced, including five exported to Hamersley Iron, Australia.

===C425===
The C425 was launched in 1964 in response to a request from Erie-Lackawanna for a 2,500-horsepower B-B locomotive, and was powered by a 2,500-horsepower, 16-cylinder Model 251C engine. It remained in production until December 1966, just five months before the final C424 was delivered in May 1967. A total of 91 units were built.

===C855===
The C855 was launched in 1964 in response to a request from Union Pacific for a dual engine unit to replace up to ten first-generation locomotives. It was powered by two Model 251C 16-cylinder engines, producing 5,500 horsepower. Only three were built, all in 1964. Two of the units had control cabs and one was a booster unit. Ultimately, poor performance led to their retirement after less than eight years in service.

===C630===
The C630 was launched in 1965, prompted by the impending launches of locomotives by both GE and EMD of equivalent size, and was the first production locomotive to use AC technology, as DC generators were too large and complex to be used at such high powers. It was powered by a 3,000-horsepower, 16-cylinder, Model 251E engine. It was launched in 1965, and remained in production until 1967, with 77 units produced.

===C630M===
The C630M was the Canadian version of the C630. It was built by MLW from 1967 to 1969. A total of 56 units were produced.

===C430===
The C430 was a four-axle equivalent of the C630, and used the same AC equipment and engines. It was launched in 1966 as the latest update of B-B locomotives, and introduced Alco&#x27;s new high-adhesion truck, offered as an option on the C630, but standard on the C430. Production ended in 1967, after 16 were produced.

===C415===
The C415 was launched in 1966 as a new switcher, designed for operation by a single person. It used a 1,500-horsepower, 8-cylinder, Model 251E engine, configured as a V8. It remained in production until 1968, with 26 units built.

===C636===
The C636 was launched in 1967 in response to the introduction of the EMD SD45, which offered more power than anything in production at the time. The C636 was powered by a 3,600-horsepower, 16-cylinder, Model 251F engine. Alco built 34 units through 1968. AE Goodwin built 31 units in Australia under licence from Alco between 1968 and 1972. Total production was 65 units.

===C643DH===
Alco built three hydraulic drive locomotives for Southern Pacific in 1964. These units were equipped with the Voith hydraulic drive system and a pair of 12-cylinder 251 engines producing 2,150 horsepower each for a combined total of 4,300 horsepower.

==Unproduced models==

===C624===
The C624 was one of the original models announced at the launch event, but never went into production, its design having been eclipsed by rapid advances in engine technology. The successor to it was the C628.

===C620===
The C620 would have been a 2,000-horsepower, six-axle locomotive, powered by the same engine as the C420. The design was proposed to several railroads, but no orders were placed.

===C428===
The C428 would have been a 2,750-horsepower, four-axle locomotive, powered by the same engine as the C628. Due to the complexity of DC generators at this level of power, the AC powered C430 was developed instead.

===C636P and C636F===
The C636P and C636F would have been cowled (full-width enclosed carbody) units based on the C636. The C636P was a dual service design, and the C636F was Alco&#x27;s response to a request by the Santa Fe Railroad for a cowled locomotive in both cab and booster form.

===C650DH===
This was a proposed 5,000-horsepower hydraulic-drive twin diesel-engined locomotive.

<text>In mathematics, the Pontryagin classes, named after Lev Pontryagin, are certain characteristic classes of real vector bundles. The Pontryagin classes lie in cohomology groups with degrees a multiple of four.

== Definition ==
Given a real vector bundle formula_1 over formula_2, its formula_3-th Pontryagin class formula_4 is defined as 
:formula_5
where:
*formula_6 denotes the formula_7-th Chern class of the complexification formula_8 of formula_1, 
*formula_10 is the formula_11-cohomology group of formula_2 with integer coefficients.

The rational Pontryagin class formula_13 is defined to be the image of formula_4 in formula_15, the formula_11-cohomology group of formula_2 with rational coefficients.

== Properties ==
The total Pontryagin class 
:formula_18
is (modulo 2-torsion) multiplicative with respect to 
Whitney sum of vector bundles, i.e., 
:formula_19
for two vector bundles formula_1 and formula_21 over formula_2. In terms of the individual Pontryagin classes formula_23, 
:formula_24
:formula_25
and so on.

The vanishing of the Pontryagin classes and Stiefel–Whitney classes of a vector bundle does not guarantee that the vector bundle is trivial. For example, up to vector bundle isomorphism, there is a unique nontrivial rank 10 vector bundle formula_26 over the 9-sphere. (The clutching function for formula_26 arises from the homotopy group formula_28.) The Pontryagin classes and Stiefel-Whitney classes all vanish: the Pontryagin classes don&#x27;t exist in degree 9, and the Stiefel–Whitney class formula_29 of formula_26 vanishes by the Wu formula formula_31. Moreover, this vector bundle is stably nontrivial, i.e. the Whitney sum of formula_26 with any trivial bundle remains nontrivial. 

Given a formula_33-dimensional vector bundle formula_1 we have 
:formula_35
where formula_36 denotes the Euler class of formula_1, and formula_38 denotes the cup product of cohomology classes.

=== Pontryagin classes and curvature ===
As was shown by Shiing-Shen Chern and André Weil around 1948, the rational Pontryagin classes 
:formula_39
can be presented as differential forms which depend polynomially on the curvature form of a vector bundle. This Chern–Weil theory revealed a major connection between algebraic topology and global differential geometry.

For a vector bundle formula_1 over a formula_41-dimensional differentiable manifold formula_2 equipped with a connection, the total Pontryagin class is expressed as 
:formula_43

where formula_44 denotes the curvature form, and formula_45 denotes the de Rham cohomology groups.{{fact|date=November 2024}}

=== Pontryagin classes of a manifold ===
The Pontryagin classes of a smooth manifold are defined to be the Pontryagin classes of its tangent bundle.

Novikov proved in 1966 that if two compact, oriented, smooth manifolds are homeomorphic then their rational Pontryagin classes formula_46 in formula_47 are the same. If the dimension is at least five, there are at most finitely many different smooth manifolds with given homotopy type and Pontryagin classes.

=== Pontryagin classes from Chern classes ===
The Pontryagin classes of a complex vector bundle formula_48 is completely determined by its Chern classes. This follows from the fact that formula_49, the Whitney sum formula, and properties of Chern classes of its complex conjugate bundle. That is, formula_50 and formula_51. Then, this given the relationformula_52for example, we can apply this formula to find the Pontryagin classes of a complex vector bundle on a curve and a surface. For a curve, we haveformula_53so all of the Pontryagin classes of complex vector bundles are trivial. On a surface, we haveformula_54showing formula_55. On line bundles this simplifies further since formula_56 by dimension reasons.

=== Pontryagin classes on a Quartic K3 Surface ===
Recall that a quartic polynomial whose vanishing locus in formula_57 is a smooth subvariety is a K3 surface. If we use the normal sequenceformula_58we can findformula_59showing formula_60 and formula_61. Since formula_62 corresponds to four points, due to Bézout&#x27;s lemma, we have the second chern number as formula_63. Since formula_64 in this case, we have

formula_65. This number can be used to compute the third stable homotopy group of spheres.

== Pontryagin numbers ==
Pontryagin numbers are certain topological invariants of a smooth manifold. Each Pontryagin number of a manifold formula_2 vanishes if the dimension of formula_2 is not divisible by 4. It is defined in terms of the Pontryagin classes of the manifold formula_2 as follows:

Given a smooth formula_69-dimensional manifold formula_2 and a collection of natural numbers 
:formula_71 such that formula_72,
the Pontryagin number formula_73 is defined by
:formula_74
where formula_23 denotes the formula_3-th Pontryagin class and formula_77 the fundamental class of formula_2.

=== Properties ===
#Pontryagin numbers are oriented cobordism invariant; and together with Stiefel-Whitney numbers they determine an oriented manifold&#x27;s oriented cobordism class.
#Pontryagin numbers of closed Riemannian manifolds (as well as Pontryagin classes) can be calculated as integrals of certain polynomials from the curvature tensor of a Riemannian manifold.
#Invariants such as signature and formula_79-genus can be expressed through Pontryagin numbers. For the theorem describing the linear combination of Pontryagin numbers giving the signature see Hirzebruch signature theorem.

== Generalizations ==
There is also a &quot;quaternionic&quot; Pontryagin class, for vector bundles with quaternion structure.

<doc id="385946" wikidata="Q2595720" url="?curid=385946" title="Hierarchy of genres">
<text>A hierarchy of genres is any formalization which ranks different genres in an art form in terms of their prestige and cultural value.

In literature, the epic was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by Samuel Johnson in his &quot;Life of John Milton&quot;: &quot;By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions.&quot; Below that came lyric poetry, and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for drama. The novel took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.

In music, lyrical settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the Baroque period, and opera retained a superior status for much longer. The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those written for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increased its popularity.

The hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century. These were formalized and promoted by the academies in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French Académie de peinture et de sculpture, which held a central role in Academic art. The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:

*History painting, including historically important, religious, mythological, or allegorical subjects
*Portrait painting
*Genre painting or scenes of everyday life
*Landscape and cityscape art (landscapists were called &quot;common footmen in the Army of Art&quot; by the Dutch theorist Samuel van Hoogstraten)
*Animal painting
*Still life

The hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to &quot;render visible the universal essence of things&quot; (&quot;imitare&quot; in Italian) and that which merely consisted of &quot;mechanical copying of particular appearances&quot; (&quot;ritrarre&quot;). Idealism was privileged over realism in line with Renaissance Neo-Platonist philosophy.

The term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the High Renaissance onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art. This had not been the case in Medieval art and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view. The Raphael Cartoons are a clear example of the continuing status of tapestry, the most expensive form of art in the 16th century. In the Early Medieval period, lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century. Until the 19th century, the most extravagant objets d&#x27;art remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings. Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.

==Renaissance art==

The hierarchy grew out of the struggle to gain acceptance of painting as one of the liberal arts, and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with architecture and sculpture. These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as Leon Battista Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci, and Giorgio Vasari. Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters&#x27; art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances. In his &quot;De Pictura&quot; (&quot;About Painting&quot;) of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.

Theorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of Michelangelo, who was strongly influenced by neoplatonism. By the time of Mannerist theorists such as Gian Paolo Lomazzo and Federico Zuccari (both also painters) this was far less of a priority. Both emphasized beauty as &quot;something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions&quot;, a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism. In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status. Ideas of decorum also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.

During the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects. For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the Medici in his Medici Chapel sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort Gainsborough is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe).

Many portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter&#x27;s vanity; the theorist Armenini claimed in 1587 that &quot;portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [&quot;maniera&quot;] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses&quot;. On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.

The question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the decrees on art of the Council of Trent of 1563. Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased. Until the challenge of Caravaggio at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.

==17th and 18th century art==
The new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class. Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of Dutch Golden Age painting and Flemish Baroque painting. However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by Karel van Mander, Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten, Gerard de Lairesse and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.

The hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as Jan Steen, Karel Dujardin and Vermeer produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell. The unhappy history of Rembrandt&#x27;s last history commission, &quot;The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis&quot; (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience. In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life. Often the different elements were painted by different artists; Rubens and Frans Snyders often co-operated in this way.

The size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a &quot;landscape with...&quot;, a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish world landscapes of Joachim Patinir in the early 16th century. Flemish Baroque painting was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.

An influential formulation of 1667 by André Félibien, a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d&#x27;un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement; &amp; comme la figure de l&#x27;homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l&#x27;imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n&#x27;a pas encore cette haute perfection de l&#x27;Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l&#x27;honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d&#x27;une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble; il faut traiter l&#x27;histoire &amp; la fable; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.

He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled. For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal&quot;.

Allegorical painting was raised above other types of history painting; together they were the &quot;grand genre&quot;, including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjects—they embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the French Revolution, history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.

After history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: portraits, scenes of everyday life (called &quot;scènes de genre&quot;, or &quot;genre painting&quot;, and also &quot;petit genre&quot; to contrast it with the &quot;grande genre&quot;), landscapes, animal painting, and finally still lifes. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintings—neither ideal in style, nor elevated in subject—were admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art.

The hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes. This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental &quot;The Young Bull&quot; of the Dutch artist Paulus Potter, as well as the larger of the two &quot;Butchers&#x27; Shop&quot; canvases of Annibale Carracci. But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits. Rubens&#x27; largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.

The use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later dissenting theorists, such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, held that this focus on allegory was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the Horatian dictum ut pictura poesis (&quot;as is painting so is poetry&quot;).

The British painter Sir Joshua Reynolds in his &quot;Discourses&quot; of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter&#x27;s access to central forms, those products of the mind&#x27;s generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body&#x27;s essence or ideal.

Though Reynolds agreed with Félibien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: &quot;Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of Virgil, that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to Titian; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance.&quot;

Though European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the Grand Manner, where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. Jean-Antoine Watteau invented a genre that was called fêtes galantes, where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian settings; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them.

Claude Lorrain practised a genre called the ideal landscape, where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term &quot;historical landscape&quot; which received official recognition in the Académie française when a for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.

==19th century==
Romanticism greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in British art and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the Style Troubadour in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American Hudson River School and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.

Until the middle of the 19th century, women were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic training—that of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.

Toward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the Académie française, including the status accorded to history painting, which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy. In Britain the Pre-Raphaelite movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts. Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects. New artistic movements included the Realists and Impressionists, which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattached from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.

<text>André Michaux ([[André Michaux|[[André Michaux|; sometimes [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] as ]]Andrew Michaud&quot;&#x27;; 8 March 174611 October 1802) was a French botanist and explorer. He is most noted for his study of North American [[flora]]. In addition Michaux collected specimens in England, Spain, France, and even Persia. His work was part of a larger European effort to gather knowledge about the natural world. Michaux&#x27;s contributions include &quot;Histoire des chênes de l&#x27;Amérique&quot; (1801; &quot;The Oaks of North America&quot;) and &quot;Flora Boreali-Americana&quot; (1803; &quot;The Flora of North America&quot;) which continued to be botanical references well into the 19th century. His son, [[François André Michaux]], also became an authoritative botanist.
==Biography==
Michaux was born in Satory, part of [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], [[Yvelines]], where his father managed farmland on the king&#x27;s estate. Michaux was trained in the agricultural sciences in anticipation of his one-day assuming his father&#x27;s duties, and received a basic classical 18th century education, including Latin and some Greek, until he was fourteen. In 1769, he married Cecil Claye, the daughter of a prosperous farmer; she died a year later giving birth to their son, François André. Michaux then took up the study of botany and became a student of [[Bernard de Jussieu]]. In 1779 he spent time studying botany in England, and in 1780 he explored [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], the [[Pyrenees]] and northern Spain. In 1782 he was sent by the French government as secretary to the French consul on a botanical mission to [[Iran|Persia]]. His journey began unfavourably, as he was robbed of all his equipment except his books; but he gained influential support in Persia after curing the shah of a dangerous illness. After two years he returned to France with a fine herbarium, and also introduced numerous Eastern plants into the botanical gardens of France.
André Michaux was appointed by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] as Royal botanist under the General Director of the [[Bâtiments du Roi]] and sent to the United States in 1785 with an annual salary of 2000 &quot;livres&quot;, to make the first organized investigation of plants that could be of value in French building and carpentry, medicine and agriculture. He traveled with his son François André Michaux (1770–1855) through Canada and the United States. In 1786, Michaux attempted to establish a horticultural garden of thirty acres in Bergen&#x27;s Wood on the [[Hudson Palisades]] near [[Hackensack, New Jersey]]. The garden, overseen by [[Pierre-Paul Saunier]] from the [[Jardin des Plantes]], Paris, who had emigrated with Michaux, failed because of the harsh winters. In 1787, Michaux established and maintained for a decade a botanical garden of 111 acres near what is now Aviation Avenue in [[North Charleston, South Carolina]], from which he made many expeditions to various parts of North America.
Michaux described and named many North American species during this time. Between 1785 and 1791 he shipped ninety cases of plants and many seeds to France. At the same time he introduced many species to America from various parts of the world, including &quot;[[Camellia]]&quot;, [[sweet osmanthus|tea-olive]], and [[crepe myrtle]].

===Proposed expedition that almost happened===

After the collapse of the French monarchy, Michaux, who was a royal botanist, lost his source of income. He solicited support for an American-funded exploration under the auspices of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

In 1793, a decade before the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], with no federal funding available, [[David Rittenhouse]] (1732–1796), President of the [[American Philosophical Society]] asked [[Thomas Jefferson]] to draft a &quot;subscription list&quot; to raise funds to Explore the interior of North America, from the [[Mississippi River]] along the [[Missouri River|Missouri]], and westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Jefferson personally drew it up and secured 30 signatures, himself included, of influential, wealthy supporters, pledging various amounts to finance it:

<doc id="385963" wikidata="Q6781673" url="?curid=385963" title="Maryon Pearson">
<text>Maryon Elspeth Pearson (née Moody; December 13, 1901 – December 26, 1989) was the wife of Lester B. Pearson, the 14th Prime Minister of Canada.

== Life ==
Maryon Elspeth Moody was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on December 13, 1901. Her father was a doctor and her mother was superintendent of nurses at a hospital.

Maryon and Lester Pearson met at the University of Toronto, where he was a teacher and she was a student. The two married on August 22, 1925.

They had one son, Geoffrey, and one daughter, Patricia. Geoffrey was married to former Canadian Senator Landon Pearson. Geoffrey and Landon&#x27;s daughter is &quot;USA Today&quot; journalist Patricia Pearson (not to be confused with her aunt, of the same name, who did not maintain a public career).

== Reputation ==
Maryon Pearson was best known for her sharp-tongued wit, developing a reputation as an outspoken figure who freely spoke her mind and had little use for the demure and quiet image fostered by many wives of previous prime ministers.

It was reportedly also at Maryon Pearson&#x27;s behest that the practice of curtseying to the Governor General and his consort was discontinued—apparently because Pearson refused to act deferentially toward her longtime friend Norah Michener.

Among her most famous quotations:&quot;Behind every successful man, there stands a surprised woman.&quot;

&quot;We lost everything. We even won our own constituency.&quot;

&quot;The big problem is to find suitable hats. I don&#x27;t care for them all that much, but you have to wear them in politics.&quot;

&quot;On the retired former prime minister&#x27;s greater time at home:&quot; &quot;I married him for better or worse. I didn&#x27;t marry him for lunch.&quot;

&quot;On being asked during an election campaign by a reporter, &quot;Is there anything you&#x27;d like to bring up, Mrs. Pearson?&quot;:&quot; &quot;Yes, three doughnuts and six cups of coffee.&quot;

&quot;On being asked for her opinion of a speech given by Lester&quot;: &quot;You missed several opportunities to sit down.&quot;

<doc id="385967" wikidata="Q473670" url="?curid=385967" title="January Uprising">
<text>The January Uprising was an insurrection principally in Russia&#x27;s Kingdom of Poland that was aimed at putting an end to Russian occupation of part of Poland and regaining independence. It began on 22 January 1863 and continued until the last insurgents were captured by the Russian forces in 1864.

It was the longest-lasting insurgency in partitioned Poland. The conflict engaged all levels of society and arguably had profound repercussions on contemporary international relations and ultimately transformed Polish society.

A confluence of factors rendered the uprising inevitable in early 1863. The Polish nobility and urban bourgeois circles longed for the semi-autonomous status they had enjoyed in Congress Poland before the previous insurgency, a generation earlier in 1830, and youth encouraged by the success of the Italian independence movement urgently desired the same outcome. Russia had been weakened by its Crimean adventure and had introduced a more liberal attitude in its internal politics which encouraged Poland&#x27;s underground National Government to plan an organised strike against their Russian occupiers no earlier than the spring of 1863. They had not reckoned with Aleksander Wielopolski, the pro-Russian archconservative head of the civil administration in the Russian partition. In an attempt to derail the Polish national movement, he brought forward to January the conscription of young Polish activists into the Imperial Russian Army for 20-year service. That decision is what triggered the January Uprising of 1863, the very outcome that Wielopolski had wanted to avoid.
The rebellion by young Polish conscripts was soon joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and members of the political class. The insurrectionists, as yet ill-organised, were severely outnumbered and lacking sufficient foreign support and forced into hazardous guerrilla tactics. Reprisals were swift and ruthless. Public executions and deportations to Siberia eventually persuaded many Poles to abandon armed struggle. In addition, Tsar Alexander II hit the landed gentry hard and, as a result, the whole economy, with a sudden decision in 1864 for finally abolishing serfdom in Poland. The ensuing breakup of estates and destitution of many peasants convinced educated Poles to turn instead to the idea of &quot;organic work&quot;, economic and cultural self-improvement.

==Background==

Despite the Russian Empire&#x27;s loss of the Crimean War and weakened economic and political state, Alexander II warned in 1856 against further concessions with the words &quot;forget any dreams&quot;. There were two prevailing streams of thought among the population of the Kingdom of Poland. One had patriotic stirrings within liberal-conservative usually landed and intellectual circles, centered around Andrzej Zamoyski and hoped for an orderly return to the constitutional status before 1830; they became characterized as the &quot;Whites&quot;. The alternative tendency, characterized as the &quot;Reds&quot;, represented a democratic movement uniting peasants, workers and some clergy. For both streams central to their dilemma was the &quot;peasant question&quot;. However, estate owners tended to favour the abolition of serfdom in exchange for compensation, but the democratic movement saw the overthrow of the Russian yoke as entirely dependent on an unconditional liberation of the peasantry.
Just as the democrats organized the first religious and patriotic demonstrations in 1860, covert resistance groups began to form among educated youth. Blood was first to shed in Warsaw in February 1861, when the Russian Army attacked a demonstration in Castle Square on the anniversary of the Battle of Grochów. There were five fatalities. Fearing the spread of spontaneous unrest, Alexander II reluctantly agreed to accept a petition for a change in the system of governance. Ultimately, he agreed to the appointment of Aleksander Wielopolski to head a commission to look into Religious Observance and Public Education and announced the formation of a State Council and self-governance for towns and powiats. The concessions did not prevent further demonstrations. On 8 April, there were 200 killed and 500 wounded by Russian fire. Martial law was imposed in Warsaw, and brutally-repressive measures were taken against the organisers in Warsaw and Vilna by deporting them deep into Russia.

In Vilna alone, 116 demonstrations were held in 1861. That autumn, Russians had introduced a state of emergency in Vilna Governorate, Kovno Governorate and Grodno Governorate.

The events led to a speedier consolidation of the resistance. Future leaders of the uprising gathered secretly in St. Petersburg, Warsaw, Vilna, Paris and London. Two bodies emerged from those consultations. By October 1861, the urban &quot;Movement Committee&quot; (Komitet Ruchu Miejski) had been formed, followed in June 1862, by the Central National Committee (&quot;CNC&quot;). Its leadership included Stefan Bobrowski, Jarosław Dąbrowski, Zygmunt Padlewski, Agaton Giller and Bronisław Szwarce. The body directed the creation of national structures that were intended to become a new secret Polish state. The CNC had not planned an uprising before the spring of 1863 at the earliest. However, Wielopolski&#x27;s move to start conscription to the Russian Army in mid-January forced its hand to call the uprising prematurely on the night of 22–23 January 1863.

==Call to arms in the Kingdom of Poland==

The uprising broke out at a moment when general peace prevailed in Europe, and although there was vociferous support for the Poles, powers such as France, Britain and Austria were unwilling to disturb the international calm. The revolutionary leaders did not have sufficient means to arm and equip the groups of young men hiding in forests to escape Alexander Wielopolski&#x27;s order of conscription into the Russian Army. Initially, about 10,000 men rallied around the revolutionary banner. The volunteers came chiefly from city working classes and minor clerks, but there was also a significant number of the younger sons of the poorer &quot;szlachta&quot; (nobility) and a number of priests of lower rank. Initially, the Russian government had at its disposal an army of 90,000 men, under Russian General Anders Edvard Ramsay, in Poland.

It looked as if the rebellion might be crushed quickly. Undeterred, the CNC&#x27;s provisional government issued a manifesto in which it declared &quot;all sons of Poland are free and equal citizens without distinction of creed, condition or rank&quot;. It decreed that land cultivated by the peasants, whether on the basis of rent or service, should become their unconditional property, and compensation for it would be given to the landlords out of State general funds. The provisional government did its best to send supplies to the unarmed and scattered volunteers, who, in February, had fought in eighty bloody skirmishes with the Russians. Meanwhile, the CNC issued an appeal for assistance to the nations of Western Europe that was received everywhere with supportive sentiments from Norway to Portugal. The Confederate States of America sympathized with the Polish-Lithuanian rebels and viewed their struggles analogous. Italian, French and Hungarian officers answered the call. Pope Pius IX was against the 1863 uprising of which he informed Wsyslaw Czartoryski. The historian Jerzy Zdrada records that by the late spring and the early summer of 1863, there were 35,000 Poles under arms facing a Russian Army of 145,000 in the Polish Kingdom.

== Uprising spreads to Lithuania ==
On 1 February 1863, the uprising erupted in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In April and May, it had spread to Dinaburg, Latvia and Witebsk, Belarus, to the Kiev Governorate, northern Ukraine, and to the Wolynian Voivodship. Volunteers, weapons and supplies began to flow in over the borders from Galicia, in the Austrian Partition, and from the Prussian Partition. Volunteers also arrived from Italy, Hungary, France and Russia itself. The greatest setback was that in spite of the liberation manifesto from the KCN, without prior ideological agitation, the peasantry could not be mobilized to participate in the struggle except in those regions that were dominated by Polish units, which saw a gradual enrollment into the uprising of agricultural workers.

===Secret State===
The secret Polish state was directed by the Rada Narodowa (RN, National Council) to which the civil and military structures on the ground were accountable. It was a &quot;virtual coalition government&quot; formed of the &quot;Reds&quot; and the &quot;Whites&quot; and was led by Zygmunt Sierakowski, Antanas Mackevičius and Konstanty Kalinowski. The latter two supported their counterparts in Poland and adhered to common policies.

Its diplomatic corps was centered on Paris under the direction of Wladyslaw Czartoryski. The eruption of armed conflict in the former Commonwealth of Two Nations had surprised western European capitals, even if public opinion responded with sympathy for the rebel cause. It had dawned on Paris, London, Vienna and Saint Petersburg that the crisis could plausibly turn into an international war. For their part, Russian diplomats considered the uprising an internal matter, and European stability was generally predicated on the fate of Poland&#x27;s aspiration.

===International repercussions===

The uncovering of the existence of the Alvensleben Convention, signed on 8 February 1863 by Prussia and Russia in St. Petersburg, to suppress the Poles jointly, internationalized the uprising. It enabled Western powers to take the diplomatic initiative for their own ends. Napoleon III of France, already a sympathizer with Poland, was concerned to protect his border on the Rhine and turned his political guns on Prussia with a view to provoking a war with it. He was simultaneously seeking an alliance with Austria. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, sought to prevent a Franco-Prussian war and to block an Austrian alliance with France and so looked to scupper any rapprochement between France and Russia. Austria was competing with Prussia for the leadership of the German territories but rejected French approaches for an alliance and spurned any support of Napoleon III as acting against German interests. There was no discussion of military intervention on behalf of the Poles, despite Napoleon&#x27;s support for the continuation of the insurgency.France, the United Kingdom and Austria agreed to a diplomatic intervention in defense of Polish rights and in April issued diplomatic notes that were intended to be no more than persuasive in tone. The Polish RN hoped that the evolution of the insurgency would ultimately push western powers to adopt an armed intervention, which was the flavour of Polish diplomatic talks with those powers. The Polish line was that the establishment of continued peace in Europe was conditional on the return of an independent Polish state.

With the threat of war averted, St. Petersburg left the door open for negotiations but was adamant in its rejection of any western rights to armed conflict. In June 1863, western powers iterated the conditions: an amnesty for the insurgents, the creation of a national representative structure, the development of autonomous concessions across the Kingdom, a recall of a conference of Congress of Vienna (1815) signatories and a ceasefire for its duration. That fell well below the expectations of the leadership of the uprising. While concerned by the threat of war, Alexander II felt secure enough with the support of his people to reject the proposals. Although France and Britain were insulted, they did not proceed with further interventions, which enabled Russia to extend and finally to break off negotiations in September 1863.

==Outcome on the ground==

Apart from the efforts of Sweden, diplomatic intervention by foreign powers on behalf of Poland was on the balance unhelpful in drawing attention away from the aim of Polish national unity towards its social divisions. It alienated Austria, which had maintained friendly neutrality towards Poland and not interfered with Polish activities in Galicia. It prejudiced public opinion among radical groups in Russia that until then had been friendly because they regarded the uprising as a social, rather than a national, insurgency. It also stirred the Russian government to ever more brutal suppression of hostilities and repression against its Polish participants, who had grown in strength.

In addition to the thousands who fell in battle, 128 men were hanged under the personal supervision of Mikhail Muravyov &#x27;Muravyov the Hangman&#x27;, and 9,423 men and women were exiled to Siberia, 2,500 men according to Russia&#x27;s own estimates. The historian Norman Davies gives the number as 80,000 and noted it was the single largest deportation in Russian history. Whole villages and towns were burned down. All economic and social activities were suspended, and the &quot;szlachta&quot; was ruined through the confiscation of property and exorbitant taxes. Such was the brutality of Russian troops that their actions were condemned throughout Europe. Count Fyodor Berg, the newly appointed governor, Namiestnik of Poland, and the successor to Muravyov, employed harsh measures against the population and intensified systematic Russification in an effort to eradicate Polish traditions and culture.

===Social and ethnic divisions laid bare===
Insurgents of landed background constituted 60% of the uprising&#x27;s participants (in Lithuania and Belarus around 50%, in Ukraine some 75%). Records indicate that 95% of those punished for participation in the uprising were Catholic, which corresponded to the general proportion of participants.

Despite outreach to Rus (Ruthenian) peasants by the Polish gentry (szlachta), comparatively few partook in the January Uprising. In some cases they assisted the Russian forces in catching rebels. This has been cited as one of the primary reasons for the failure of the uprising.

During the first 24 hours of the uprising, armouries across the country were looted, and many Russian officials were executed on sight. On 2 February 1863, was the start of the first major military engagement of the uprising between Lithuanian peasants armed mostly with scythes and a squadron of Russian hussars outside Čysta Būda, near Marijampolė. It ended with the massacre of the unprepared peasants. While there was still hope of a short war, insurgent groups merged into larger formations and recruited new volunteers.

== Evolution of events ==
The provisional government had counted on an insurgency erupting in Russia, where wide discontent with the autocratic regime then seemed to be brewing. It also counted on the active support of Napoleon III, particularly after Prussia, expecting the inevitable armed conflict with France, had made overtures to Russia sealed in the Alvensleben Convention and offered assistance in suppressing the Polish uprising. Arrangements had already been completed on 14 February and the British Ambassador to Berlin, Sir Alexander Malet, informed his government that a Prussian military envoy

has concluded a military convention with the Russian Government, according to which the two governments will reciprocally afford facilities to each other for the suppression of the insurrectionary movements which have lately taken place in Poland and Lithuania. The Prussian railways are also to be placed at the disposal of the Russian military authorities for the transportation of troops through Prussian territory from one part of the former Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth to another.

That step by Otto von Bismarck led to protests from several governments and incensed the several constituent nations of the former Commonwealth. The result was the transformation of a relatively insignificant uprising into another &quot;national war&quot; against Russia. Encouraged by promises made by Napoleon III, all provinces of the erstwhile Commonwealth, acting on the advice of Władysław Czartoryski, had taken to arms. Moreover, to Indicate their solidarity, all Commonwealth citizens holding office under the Russian government, including the Archbishop of Warsaw, Zymunt Feliński, resigned their positions and signed their allegiance to the newly constituted Government, which was composed of the five most prominent representatives of the &quot;Whites&quot;. The &quot;Reds&quot;, meanwhile, criticised the Polish National Government for being reactionary with its policy to incentivise Polish peasants to fight in the uprising. The government justified its inaction on the back of hopes of foreign military intervention promised by Napoleon III that never materialised.

===Romuald Traugutt===
It was only after Polish General Romuald Traugutt had taken matters into his own hands on 17 October 1863 to unite all classes under a single national banner that the struggle could be upheld. His restructuring in preparation for an offensive in spring 1864 was banking on a European-wide war. On 27 December 1863, he enacted a decree of the former provisional government by granting peasants the land they worked. The land was to be provided by compensating the owners through state funds after the successful conclusion of the uprising. Traugutt called upon all Polish classes to rise against Russian oppression for the creation of a new Polish state. The response was moderate since the policy came too late. The Russian government had already begun working among peasants to grant them generous parcels of land for the asking. The peasants who had been bought off did not engage with Polish revolutionaries to any extent or provide them with support.

Fighting continued intermittently during the winter of 1863–1864 on the southern edge of the Kingdom, near the Galician border, from where assistance was still forthcoming. In late December in the Lublin Voivodeship, General Michał Heydenreich&#x27;s unit was overwhelmed. The most determined resistance continued in the Świętokrzyskie Mountains, where General Józef Hauke-Bosak distinguished himself by taking several cities from the vastly superior Russian forces. However, he too succumbed to a crushing defeat on 21 February 1864 which presaged the end of the armed struggle. On 29 February, Austria imposed martial law, and on 2 March, the tsarist authorities brought in the abolition of serfdom in the Polish Kingdom. Both events neutralised Traugutt&#x27;s concept of developing the uprising with a general mobilisation of the population in the Russian partition and reliance on assistance from Galicia. In April 1864, Napoleon III abandoned the Polish cause. Władysław Czartoryski wrote to Traugutt: &quot;We are alone, and alone we shall remain&quot;.

Arrests eliminated key positions in the secret Polish state, and those who felt threatened sought refuge abroad. Traugutt was taken on the night of 10 April. After he and the last four members of the National Council, Antoni Jezioranski, Rafał Krajewski, Józef Toczyski and Roman Żuliński, had been apprehended by Russian troops, they were imprisoned and executed by hanging on 5 August at the Warsaw Citadel. That marked the symbolic closure of the Uprising. Only Aleksander Waszkowski, the head of the Warsaw insurgency eluded the police till December 1864, but he too joined the list of &quot;the lost&quot; in February 1865. The war consisting of 650 battles and skirmishes with 25,000 Polish and other insurgents killed, had lasted 18 months. The insurgency persisted in Samogitia and Podlasie, where the Greek Catholic population, outraged and persecuted for their religious observance, &quot;&quot;Kryaki&quot; (those baptised into the Greek Orthodox Church), and others like the commander and priest Stanisław Brzóska, clung the longest to the revolutionary banner until the spring of 1865.

==Decades of reprisals==
After the collapse of the uprising, harsh reprisals followed. According to official Russian information, 396 persons were executed and 18,672 were exiled to Siberia. Large numbers of men and women were sent to the interior of Russia and to the Caucasus, Urals and other remote areas. Altogether over 60,000 persons were imprisoned and subsequently exiled from Poland and consigned to distant regions of Russia.

The abolition of serfdom in early 1864 was deliberately enacted in a move designed specifically to ruin the &quot;szlachta&quot;. The Russian government confiscated 1,660 estates in Poland and 1,794 in Lithuania. A 10% income tax was imposed on all estates as a war indemnity. Only in 1869 was the tax reduced to 5% on all incomes. It was the only time that peasants paid the market price for the redemption of the land (the average for the Russian Empire was 34% above the market price). All land taken from Polish peasants since 1864 was to be returned without rights of compensation. Former serfs could sell land only to other peasants, not to &quot;szlachta&quot;. Ninety percent of the ex-serfs in the empire who actually gained land after 1861 were confined to the eight western provinces. Along with Romania, Polish landless or domestic serfs were the only people who were eligible for land grants after serfdom had been abolished.

All of that was to punish the &quot;szlachta&quot; for its role in the uprisings of 1830 and 1863. In addition to the land granted to the peasants, the Russian government gave them a forest, pasture and other privileges, known under the name of &quot;servitutes&quot;, which proved to be a source of incessant irritation between the landowners and peasants over the ensuing decades and impeded economic development. The government took over all church estates and funds and abolished monasteries and convents. With the exception of religious instruction, all teaching in schools was ordered to be in Russian. That also became the official language of the country, to be used exclusively in all offices of central and local government. All traces of former Polish autonomy were removed, and the Kingdom was divided into ten provinces, each with an appointed Russian military governor under the control of the Governor-General in Warsaw. All former Polish government functionaries were deprived of their positions and replaced by Russian officials. According to George Kennan, &quot;thousands of Polish insurgents&quot; were transported to the &quot;Nerchinsk silver-mining district... after the unsuccessful insurrection of 1863&quot;.

==Legacy==
These measures of cultural eradication proved to be only partially effective. In 1905, 41 years after Russia crushed the uprising, the next generation of Poles rose once again in the Łódź insurrection, which too failed.

The January Uprising was one in a centuries-long series of Polish uprisings. In its aftermath, two new movements began to evolve that set the political agenda for the next century. One, led by the descendant of Lithuanians, Józef Piłsudski emerged as the Polish Socialist Party. The other, led by Roman Dmowski, became the National Democracy movement; sometimes referred to as &quot;Endecja&quot;, its roots lay in Catholic conservatism that sought national sovereignty, along with the reversal of forced Russification and Germanisation by the Polonisation of the partitioned territories in the former Commonwealth.

==Influence on art and literature==
Falling into the late romantic period, the events and figures of the uprising inspired many Polish painters, including Artur Grottger, Juliusz Kossak and Michał Elwiro Andriolli, and marked the delineation with the positivism that followed.

* The Polish poet Cyprian Norwid wrote a famous poem, &quot;Chopin&#x27;s Piano,&quot; describing the defenestration of the composer&#x27;s piano during the January 1863 Uprising, when Russian soldiers maliciously threw the instrument out of a second-floor Warsaw apartment. Chopin had left Warsaw and Poland forever shortly before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising.
* Eliza Orzeszkowa, a leading Polish positivist writer and nominee for the Nobel Prize in Literature wrote &quot;Nad Niemnem&quot; a novel set in and around the city of Grodno after the 1863 January Uprising.
* Józef Jarzębowski has put together material from unknown people who lived through the uprising in his &quot;Mówią Ludzie Roku 1863: Antologia nieznanych i małoznanych Głosów Ludzi współczesnych&quot;. London: Veritas, 1963. (&quot;Voices from 1863: An Anthology of unknown and little known contemporary Perspectives&quot;).
* In the initial draft of &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; by Jules Verne but not in the published version, Captain Nemo was a Polish nobleman whose family had been brutally murdered by the Russians during the January 1863 Uprising. Since France had only recently signed an alliance with the Russian Empire, for the novel&#x27;s final version, Verne&#x27;s editor, Pierre-Jules Hetzel, made him obscure Nemo&#x27;s motives.
* In Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s novel &quot;Pierre et Jean&quot;, the protagonist Pierre has a friend, an old Polish chemist who is said to have come to France after the bloody events in his motherland. The story is believed to refer to the January Uprising.

<text>In its strictest sense, tmesis (; plural tmeses ; Ancient Greek: &quot;tmēsis&quot; &quot;a cutting&quot; &lt; &quot;temnō&quot;, &quot;I cut&quot;) is a word compound that is divided into two parts, with another word infixed between the parts, thus constituting a separate word compound. Example: &quot;un-freaking-believable&quot; (an emphatic way to say &quot;unbelievable&quot;). In a broader sense, &quot;tmesis&quot; is a recognizable phrase (such as a phrasal verb) or word that is divided into two parts, with one or more words interpolated between the parts, thus creating a separate phrase.

==Verbs==
Tmesis of prefixed verbs (whereby the prefix is separated from the simple verb) was thought to be an original feature of the Ancient Greek language, common in Homer (and later poetry), but not used in Attic prose. Such separable verbs are also part of the normal grammatical usage of some modern languages, such as Dutch and German.

===Ancient Greek===

Tmesis in Ancient Greek is something of a misnomer, since there is not necessarily a splitting of the prefix from the verb; rather the consensus now seems to be that the separate prefix or pre-verb reflects a stage in the language where the prefix had not yet joined onto the verb. There are many examples in Homer&#x27;s epics, the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, both of which preserve archaic features. One common and oft-cited example is (&quot;kata dakrua leibōn;&quot; &quot;shedding tears&quot;), in which the pre-verb/prefix &quot;kata-&quot; &quot;down&quot; has not yet joined the verbal participle &quot;leibōn&quot; &quot;shedding&quot;. In later Greek, these would combine to form the compound verb &quot;kataleibōn&quot; &quot;shedding (in a downwards direction)&quot;.

===Latin===
Tmesis is found as a poetic or rhetorical device in classical Latin poetry, such as Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Words such as &quot;circumdare&quot; (&quot;to surround&quot;) are split apart with other words of the sentence in between, e.g. &quot;circum virum dant&quot;: &quot;they surround the man&quot; (circumdant (circum- prefix + dant)). This device is used in this way to create a visual image of surrounding the man by means of the words on the line. In the work of the poet Ennius, the literal splitting of the word &quot;cerebrum&quot; creates a vivid image: &quot;saxo cere comminuit brum&quot; &quot;he shattered his brain with a rock.&quot;

===Old Irish===
Tmesis can be found in some early Old Irish texts, such as Audacht Morainn (The Testament of Morann). Old Irish verbs are found at the beginning of clauses (in a VSO word order) and often possess prepositional pre-verbal particles, e.g. &quot;ad-midethar&quot; (ad- prefix) &quot;evaluates, estimates&quot;. Tmesis occurs when the pre-verbal particle is separated from the verbal stem and the verbal stem is placed in clause final position while the pre-verbal particle/prefix remains at the beginning of the clause. This results in an abnormal word order, e.g. &quot;ad- cruth caín -cichither&quot; &quot;[the] fair form will be seen&quot; (where &quot;ad-chichither&quot; is the future third-person singular passive of &quot;ad-cí&quot; &quot;sees&quot;).

===Old Norse===
Examples of tmesis have been found in skaldic poetry. In addition to the use of kennings, skalds used tmesis to obscure the meaning of the poem. One use of tmesis was to divide the elements of personal names.

===English===
Colloquial examples include &quot;un-bloody-believable&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and several variants. Numerous English words are joined with the vulgar infix &quot;&quot;, such as &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;. Tmesis at arbitrary points in words is not grammatically proper, e.g., no other location in un·be·liev·a·ble is quite as suitable for the infix -fucking-. Another example is &quot;&quot;.

English employs a large number of phrasal verbs, consisting of a core verb and a particle. A phrasal verb is written as two words that are analyzed semantically as a unit, but the unit may be separable under certain circumstances. For example, regarding a phrasal verb that has a transitive sense: 
:&quot;Turn off&quot; the light OR &quot;Turn&quot; the light &quot;off&quot;. (optional tmesis)
:&quot;Hand in&quot; the application OR &quot;Hand&quot; it &quot;in&quot;. (optional tmesis)

Similarly, tmesis can occur regarding a phrasal verb that has an intransitive sense. For example:
:&quot;Come back&quot; tomorrow OR &quot;Come&quot; on &quot;back&quot; tomorrow. (adjunctive tmesis)
:Let&#x27;s &quot;head out&quot; OR Let&#x27;s &quot;head&quot; right &quot;out&quot;. (adjunctive tmesis)

The intervention of an adverb or transitive object in the middle of the phrasal verb can be viewed as a form of tmesis even though the semantic unit being separated is written as two words even when not separated.

<text>The Free University of Brussels ( or ULB; , later &quot;Vrije Universiteit Brussel&quot;) was a university in Brussels, Belgium. It existed between 1834 and 1969 when it split along linguistic lines.

Founded in 1834 on the principle of &quot;free inquiry&quot; (), its founders envisaged the institution as a freethinker reaction to the traditional dominance of Catholicism in the country&#x27;s education system. It was avowedly secular and particularly associated with political liberalism during the era of pillarisation. The Free University was one of Belgium&#x27;s major universities, together with the Catholic University of Leuven and the state universities of Liège and Ghent.

The &quot;Linguistic Wars&quot; affected the Free University, which split along language lines in 1969 in the aftermath of student unrest at Leuven the previous year. Today, two institutions carry the &quot;Free University of Brussels&quot; name: the French-speaking (ULB) and the Dutch-speaking Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). Although separate, both institutions continue to collaborate under the auspices of an umbrella organisation known as Brussels University Alliance since 2013.

==History==

===Establishment of a university in Brussels===
The Free University of Brussels was founded as the Free University of Belgium (&quot;Université libre de Belgique&quot;) on 20 November 1834 in the aftermath of Belgium&#x27;s independence in 1830. Belgium had possessed three State universities at Leuven, Ghent, and Liège under Dutch rule. Still, teaching had been extensively disrupted by the revolution and continued hostilities with the Dutch. As early as 1831, Belgian freemasons of the &quot;Les Amis philanthropes&quot; lodge had considered founding a new private university. News of the imminent creation of the Catholic University of Mechelen revived the initiative among those with anti-clerical ideas, especially freemasons, liberals, and other freethinkers. Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen and Auguste Baron led the fundraising for the new institution from April 1834. It was officially founded on 20 November 1834 in the former Palace of Charles of Lorraine in Brussels with the help of the liberal mayor Nicolas-Jean Rouppe. The date of its establishment is still commemorated annually, by students of its successor institutions, as a holiday called Saint Verhaegen (often shortened to &quot;St V&quot;) for Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen.

The motivating principle behind the new institution was &quot;free inquiry&quot; () which denoted freethinking ideas inherited from the European Enlightenment. This hostility to political and religious authority led to hostility from the Catholic Church and Catholic Party politicians, increasingly associated with the Mechelen university&#x27;s successor, the Catholic University of Leuven founded in 1835. Under the system of pillarisation, the Free University became one of the principle institutions in the Liberal &quot;pillar&quot;. It was renamed the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Free University of Brussels&quot;) in 1842.

After its establishment, the Free University faced difficult times, since it received no subsidies or grants from the government; yearly fundraising events and tuition fees provided the only financial means. Verhaegen, who became a professor and later head of the new university, gave it a mission statement which he summarised in a speech to King Leopold I: &quot;the principle of &quot;free inquiry&quot; and academic freedom uninfluenced by any political or religious authority.&quot; In 1858, the Catholic Church established the Saint-Louis Institute in the city, which subsequently expanded into a university in its own right.

===Growth, internal tensions and move===
The Free University grew significantly over the following decades. In 1842, it moved to the Granvelle Palace, which it occupied until 1928. It expanded the number of subjects taught and, in 1880, became one of the first institutions in Belgium to allow female students to study in some faculties. In 1893, it received large grants from Ernest, Alfred Solvay, and Raoul Warocqué to open new faculties in the city. A disagreement over an invite from the rector Hector Denis to the anarchist geographer Élisée Reclus to speak at the university in 1893 led to some of the liberal and socialist faculty splitting away from the Free University to form the New University of Brussels (&quot;Université nouvelle de Bruxelles&quot;) in 1894. However, the institution failed to displace the Free University and closed definitively in 1919.

In 1900, the Free University&#x27;s football team won the bronze medal at the Summer Olympics. After Racing Club de Bruxelles declined to participate, a student selection with players from the university was sent by the Federation. The team was enforced with a few non-students. The Institute of Sociology was founded in 1902, then in 1904 the Solvay School of Commerce, which would later become the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management. In 1911, the university obtained its legal personality under the name &quot; - Vrije Hogeschool te Brussel&quot;.

The German occupation during World War I led to the suspension of classes for four years in 1914–1918. In the aftermath of the war, the Free University moved its principal activities to the &quot;Solbosch&quot; in the southern suburb of Ixelles, and a purpose-built university campus was created, funded by the Belgian American Educational Foundation.

The university was again closed by the German occupiers during World War II on 25 November 1941. Students from the university were involved in the Belgian Resistance, notably establishing the sabotage-orientated network Groupe G.

===Splitting of the university===
Courses at the Free University were taught exclusively in French until the early 20th century. After Belgian independence, French was widely accepted as the language of the bourgeoisie and upper classes and was the only medium in law and academia. As the Flemish Movement gained prominence among the Dutch-speaking majority in Flanders over the late 19th century, the lack of provision for Dutch speakers in higher education became a major source of political contention. Ghent University became the first institution in 1930 to teach exclusively in Dutch.

Some Free University&#x27;s Faculty of Law courses began being taught in French and Dutch as early as 1935. Nevertheless, it was not until 1963 that all faculties offered their courses in both languages. Tensions between French- and Dutch-speaking students in the country came to a head in 1968 when the Catholic University of Leuven split along linguistic lines, becoming the first of several national institutions to do so.

On 1 October 1969, the French and Dutch entities of the Free University separated into two distinct sister universities. This splitting became official with the act of 28 May 1970, of the Belgian Parliament, by which the French-speaking (ULB) and the Dutch-speaking Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) officially became two separate legal, administrative and scientific entities.

<doc id="385977" wikidata="Q10925" url="?curid=385977" title="Alphabetical order">
<text>Alphabetical order is a system whereby character strings are placed in order based on the position of the characters in the conventional ordering of an alphabet. It is one of the methods of collation. In mathematics, a lexicographical order is the generalization of the alphabetical order to other data types, such as sequences of numbers or other ordered mathematical objects.

When applied to strings or sequences that may contain digits, numbers or more elaborate types of elements, in addition to alphabetical characters, the alphabetical order is generally called a lexicographical order.

To determine which of two strings of characters comes first when arranging in alphabetical order, their first letters are compared. If they differ, then the string whose first letter comes earlier in the alphabet comes before the other string. If the first letters are the same, then the second letters are compared, and so on. If a position is reached where one string has no more letters to compare while the other does, then the first (shorter) string is deemed to come first in alphabetical order.

Capital or upper case letters are generally considered to be identical to their corresponding lower case letters for the purposes of alphabetical ordering, although conventions may be adopted to handle situations where two strings differ only in capitalization. Various conventions also exist for the handling of strings containing spaces, modified letters, such as those with diacritics, and non-letter characters such as marks of punctuation.

The result of placing a set of words or strings in alphabetical order is that all of the strings beginning with the same letter are grouped together; within that grouping all words beginning with the same two-letter sequence are grouped together; and so on. The system thus tends to maximize the number of common initial letters between adjacent words.

==History==
Alphabetical order was first used in the 1st millennium BCE by Northwest Semitic scribes using the abjad system. However, a range of other methods of classifying and ordering material, including geographical, chronological, hierarchical and by category, were preferred over alphabetical order for centuries.

Parts of the Bible are dated to the 7th–6th centuries BCE. In the Book of Jeremiah, the prophet utilizes the Atbash substitution cipher, based on alphabetical order. Similarly, biblical authors used acrostics based on the (ordered) Hebrew alphabet.

The first effective use of alphabetical order as a cataloging device among scholars may have been in ancient Alexandria, in the Great Library of Alexandria, which was founded around 300 BCE. The poet and scholar Callimachus, who worked there, is thought to have created the world&#x27;s first library catalog, known as the Pinakes, with scrolls shelved in alphabetical order of the first letter of authors&#x27; names.

In the 1st century BC, Roman writer Varro compiled alphabetic lists of authors and titles. In the 2nd century CE, Sextus Pompeius Festus wrote an encyclopedic epitome of the works of Verrius Flaccus, &quot;De verborum significatu&quot;, with entries in alphabetic order. In the 3rd century CE, Harpocration wrote a Homeric lexicon alphabetized by all letters. 

The 10th century saw major alphabetical lexicons of Greek (the &quot;Suda&quot;), Arabic (Ibn Faris&#x27;s &quot;al-Mujmal fī al-Lugha&quot;), and Biblical Hebrew (Menahem ben Saruq&#x27;s &quot;Mahberet&quot;). Alphabetical order as an aid to consultation flourished in 11th-century Italy, which contributed works on Latin (Papias&#x27;s &quot;Elementarium&quot;) and Talmudic Aramaic (Nathan ben Jehiel&#x27;s &quot;Arukh&quot;). 

In the second half of the 12th century, Christian preachers adopted alphabetical tools to analyse biblical vocabulary. This led to the compilation of alphabetical concordances of the Bible by the Dominican friars in Paris in the 13th century, under Hugh of Saint Cher. Older reference works such as St. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Interpretations of Hebrew Names&quot; were alphabetized for ease of consultation. The use of alphabetical order was initially resisted by scholars, who expected their students to master their area of study according to its own rational structures; its success was driven by such tools as Robert Kilwardby&#x27;s index to the works of St. Augustine, which helped readers access the full original text instead of depending on the compilations of excerpts which had become prominent in 12th century scholasticism. The adoption of alphabetical order was part of the transition from the primacy of memory to that of written works. The idea of ordering information by the order of the alphabet also met resistance from the compilers of encyclopaedias in the 12th and 13th centuries, who were all devout churchmen. They preferred to organise their material theologically – in the order of God&#x27;s creation, starting with &quot;Deus&quot; (meaning God).

In 1604 Robert Cawdrey had to explain in &quot;Table Alphabeticall&quot;, the first monolingual English dictionary, &quot;Nowe if the word, which thou art desirous to finde, begin with (a) then looke in the beginning of this Table, but if with (v) looke towards the end&quot;. Although as late as 1803 Samuel Taylor Coleridge condemned encyclopedias with &quot;an arrangement determined by the accident of initial letters&quot;, many lists are today based on this principle.

==Ordering in the Latin script==

===Basic order and examples===
The standard order of the modern ISO basic Latin alphabet is:
:A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y-Z

An example of straightforward alphabetical ordering follows:
*As; Aster; Astrolabe; Astronomy; Astrophysics; At; Ataman; Attack; Baa
Another example:
*Barnacle; Be; Been; Benefit; Bent
The above words are ordered alphabetically. &quot;As&quot; comes before &quot;Aster&quot; because they begin with the same two letters and &quot;As&quot; has no more letters after that whereas &quot;Aster&quot; does. The next three words come after &quot;Aster&quot; because their fourth letter (the first one that differs) is &quot;r&quot;, which comes after &quot;e&quot; (the fourth letter of &quot;Aster&quot;) in the alphabet. Those words themselves are ordered based on their sixth letters (&quot;l&quot;, &quot;n&quot; and &quot;p&quot; respectively). Then comes &quot;At&quot;, which differs from the preceding words in the second letter (&quot;t&quot; comes after &quot;s&quot;). &quot;Ataman&quot; comes after &quot;At&quot; for the same reason that &quot;Aster&quot; came after &quot;As&quot;. &quot;Attack&quot; follows &quot;Ataman&quot; based on comparison of their third letters, and &quot;Baa&quot; comes after all of the others because it has a different first letter.

===Treatment of multiword strings===
When some of the strings being ordered consist of more than one word, i.e., they contain spaces or other separators such as hyphens, then two basic approaches may be taken. In the first approach, all strings are ordered initially according to their first word, as in the sequence:
*&quot;Oak; Oak Hill; Oak Ridge; Oakley Park; Oakley River&quot;
*:where all strings beginning with the separate word &quot;Oak&quot; precede all those beginning with &quot;Oakley&quot;, because &quot;Oak&quot; precedes &quot;Oakley&quot; in alphabetical order.

In the second approach, strings are alphabetized as if they had no spaces, giving the sequence:
*&quot;Oak; Oak Hill; Oakley Park; Oakley River; Oak Ridge&quot;
*:where &quot;Oak Ridge&quot; now comes after the &quot;Oakley&quot; strings, as it would if it were written &quot;Oakridge&quot;.

The second approach is the one usually taken in dictionaries, and it is thus often called &quot;dictionary order&quot; by publishers. The first approach has often been used in book indexes, although each publisher traditionally set its own standards for which approach to use therein; there was no ISO standard for book indexes (ISO 999) before 1975.

In French, modified letters (such as those with diacritics) are treated the same as the base letter for alphabetical ordering purposes. For example, &quot;rôle&quot; comes between &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;rose&quot;, as if it were written &quot;role&quot;. However, languages that use such letters systematically generally have their own ordering rules. See below.

====Ordering by surname====
In most cultures where family names are written after given names, it is still desired to sort lists of names (as in telephone directories) by family name first. In this case, names need to be reordered to be sorted correctly. For example, Juan Hernandes and Brian O&#x27;Leary should be sorted as &quot;Hernandes, Juan&quot; and &quot;O&#x27;Leary, Brian&quot; even if they are not written this way. Capturing this rule in a computer collation algorithm is complex, and simple attempts will fail. For example, unless the algorithm has at its disposal an extensive list of family names, there is no way to decide if &quot;Gillian Lucille van der Waal&quot; is &quot;van der Waal, Gillian Lucille&quot;, &quot;Waal, Gillian Lucille van der&quot;, or even &quot;Lucille van der Waal, Gillian&quot;.

Ordering by surname is frequently encountered in academic contexts. Within a single multi-author paper, ordering the authors alphabetically by surname, rather than by other methods such as reverse seniority or subjective degree of contribution to the paper, is seen as a way of &quot;acknowledg[ing] similar contributions&quot; or &quot;avoid[ing] disharmony in collaborating groups&quot;. The practice in certain fields of ordering citations in bibliographies by the surnames of their authors has been found to create bias in favour of authors with surnames which appear earlier in the alphabet, while this effect does not appear in fields in which bibliographies are ordered chronologically.

====&quot;The&quot; and other common words====
If a phrase begins with a very common word (such as &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;, called articles in grammar), that word is sometimes ignored or moved to the end of the phrase, but this is not always the case. For example, the book &quot;The Shining&quot; might be treated as &quot;Shining&quot;, or &quot;Shining, The&quot; and therefore before the book title &quot;Summer of Sam&quot;. However, it may also be treated as simply &quot;The Shining&quot; and after &quot;Summer of Sam&quot;. Similarly, &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; might be treated as &quot;Wrinkle in Time&quot;, &quot;Wrinkle in Time, A&quot;, or &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot;. All three alphabetization methods are fairly easy to create by algorithm, but many programs rely on simple lexicographic ordering instead.

====&quot;Mac&quot; prefixes====

The prefixes &quot;M&quot; and &quot;Mc&quot; in Irish and Scottish surnames are abbreviations for &quot;Mac&quot; and are sometimes alphabetized as if the spelling is &quot;Mac&quot; in full. Thus &quot;McKinley&quot; might be listed before &quot;Mackintosh&quot; (as it would be if it had been spelled out as &quot;MacKinley&quot;). Since the advent of computer-sorted lists, this type of alphabetization is less frequently encountered, though it is still used in British telephone directories.

====&quot;St&quot; prefix====
The prefix &quot;St&quot; or &quot;St.&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;Saint&quot;, and is traditionally alphabetized as if the spelling is &quot;Saint&quot; in full. Thus in a gazetteer &quot;St John&#x27;s&quot; might be listed before &quot;Salem&quot; (as if it would be if it had been spelled out as &quot;Saint John&#x27;s&quot;). Since the advent of computer-sorted lists, this type of alphabetization is less frequently encountered, though it is still sometimes used.

====Ligatures====
Ligatures (two or more letters merged into one symbol) which are not considered distinct letters, such as Æ and Œ in English, are typically collated as if the letters were separate—&quot;æther&quot; and &quot;aether&quot; would be ordered the same relative to all other words. This is true even when the ligature is not purely stylistic, such as in loanwords and brand names.

Special rules may need to be adopted to sort strings which vary only by whether two letters are joined by a ligature.

===Treatment of numerals===

When some of the strings contain numerals (or other non-letter characters), various approaches are possible. Sometimes such characters are treated as if they came before or after all the letters of the alphabet. Another method is for numbers to be sorted alphabetically as they would be spelled: for example &quot;1776&quot; would be sorted as if spelled out &quot;seventeen seventy-six&quot;, and as if spelled &quot;vingt-quatre...&quot; (French for &quot;twenty-four&quot;). When numerals or other symbols are used as special graphical forms of letters, as &quot;1337&quot; for leet or the movie &quot;Seven&quot; (which was stylised as &quot;Se7en&quot;), they may be sorted as if they were those letters. Natural sort order orders strings alphabetically, except that multi-digit numbers are treated as a single character and ordered by the value of the number encoded by the digits.

In the case of monarchs and popes, although their numbers are in Roman numerals and resemble letters, they are normally arranged in numerical order: so, for example, even though V comes after I, the Danish king Christian IX comes after his predecessor Christian VIII.

===Language-specific conventions===

Languages which use an extended Latin alphabet generally have their own conventions for treatment of the extra letters. Also in some languages certain digraphs are treated as single letters for collation purposes. For example, the Spanish alphabet treats &quot;ñ&quot; as a basic letter following &quot;n&quot;, and formerly treated the digraphs &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;ll&quot; as basic letters following &quot;c&quot; and &quot;l&quot;, respectively. Now &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;ll&quot; are alphabetized as two-letter combinations. The new alphabetization rule was issued by the Royal Spanish Academy in 1994. These digraphs were still formally designated as letters but they are no longer so since 2010. On the other hand, the digraph &quot;rr&quot; follows &quot;rqu&quot; as expected (and did so even before the 1994 alphabetization rule), while vowels with acute accents (&quot;á, é, í, ó, ú&quot;) have always been ordered in parallel with their base letters, as has the letter &quot;ü&quot;.

In a few cases, such as Arabic and Kiowa, the alphabet has been completely reordered.

Alphabetization rules applied in various languages are listed below.
* In Arabic, there are two main orders of the 28 letter alphabet used today. The standard and most commonly used is the &quot;hijāʾī&quot; order, which was created by the early Arab linguist Nasr ibn &#x27;Asim al-Laythi and features a visual ordering method where letters are ordered based on their shapes. For example &quot;bāʾ&quot; (ب), &quot;tāʾ&quot; (ت), &quot;thāʾ&quot; (ث) are grouped as they have the same base shape or &quot;rasm&quot; (ٮ) and are differentiated only by consonant pointing known as &quot;iʻjām&quot;. The original &quot;ʾabjadī&quot; order, which phonetically resembles that of other Semitic languages as well as Latin, is still in use today, usually limited for ordering lists in a document, analogous to Roman Numerals. When the &quot;ʾabjadī&quot; order is used in numbering, letters are written in a modified form to distinguish them from letters used in words and from numerals. For example, &quot;ʾalif&quot; (ا) which looks identical to the Eastern Arabic numeral one (١), a small oval loop extends clockwise of the letter&#x27;s bottom, followed by a short tail (𞺀). Although these characters are rarely used digitally they are encoded in Unicode under Arabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols. A less common order, the &quot;&quot; order, is collated phonetically and was created by al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi.
* In Azerbaijani, there are eight additional letters to the standard Latin alphabet. Five of them are vowels: i, ı, ö, ü, ə and three are consonants: ç, ş, ğ. The alphabet is the same as the Turkish, with the same sounds written with the same letters, except for three additional letters: q, x and ə for sounds that do not exist in Turkish. Although all the &quot;Turkish letters&quot; are collated in their &quot;normal&quot; alphabetical order like in Turkish, the three extra letters are collated arbitrarily after letters whose sounds approach theirs. So, q is collated just after k, x (pronounced like a German &quot;ch&quot;) is collated just after h and ə (pronounced roughly like an English short &quot;a&quot;) is collated just after e.
* In Breton, there is no &quot;c&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;x&quot; but there are the digraphs &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;c&#x27;h&quot;, which are collated between &quot;b&quot; and &quot;d&quot;. For example: « buzhugenn, chug, c&#x27;hoar, daeraouenn » (earthworm, juice, sister, teardrop).
* In Czech and Slovak, accented vowels have secondary collating weight – compared to other letters, they are treated as their unaccented forms (in Czech, A-Á, E-É-Ě, I-Í, O-Ó, U-Ú-Ů, Y-Ý, and in Slovak, A-Á-Ä, E-É, I-Í, O-Ó-Ô, U-Ú, Y-Ý), but then they are sorted after the unaccented letters (for example, the correct lexicographic order is baa, baá, báa, báá, bab, báb, bac, bác, bač, báč [in Czech] and baa, baá, baä, báa, báá, báä, bäa, bäá, bää, bab, báb, bäb, bac, bác, bäc, bač, báč, bäč [in Slovak]). Accented consonants have primary collating weight and are collated immediately after their unaccented counterparts, with exception of Ď, Ň and Ť (in Czech) and Ď, Ĺ, Ľ, Ň, Ŕ and Ť (in Slovak), which have again secondary weight. CH is considered to be a separate letter and goes between H and I. In Slovak, DZ and DŽ are also considered separate letters and are positioned between Ď and E.
* In the Danish and Norwegian alphabets, the same extra vowels as in Swedish (see below) are also present but in a different order and with different glyphs (..., X, Y, Z, Æ, Ø, Å). Also, &quot;Aa&quot; collates as an equivalent to &quot;Å&quot;. The Danish alphabet has traditionally seen &quot;W&quot; as a variant of &quot;V&quot;, but today &quot;W&quot; is considered a separate letter.
* In Dutch the combination IJ (representing Ĳ) was formerly to be collated as Y (or sometimes as a separate letter: Y &lt; IJ &lt; Z), but is currently mostly collated as 2 letters (II &lt; IJ &lt; IK). Exceptions are phone directories; IJ is always collated as Y here because in many Dutch family names Y is used where modern spelling would require IJ. Note that a word starting with ij that is written with a capital I is also written with a capital J, for example, the town IJmuiden, the river IJssel and the country IJsland (Iceland).
* In Esperanto, consonants with circumflex accents (ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ), as well as ŭ (u with breve), are counted as separate letters and collated separately (c, ĉ, d, e, f, g, ĝ, h, ĥ, i, j, ĵ ... s, ŝ, t, u, ŭ, v, z).
* In Estonian õ, ä, ö and ü are considered separate letters and collate after w. Letters š, z and ž appear in loanwords and foreign proper names only and follow the letter s in the Estonian alphabet, which otherwise does not differ from the basic Latin alphabet.
* The Faroese alphabet also has some of the Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish extra letters, namely Æ and Ø. Furthermore, the Faroese alphabet uses the Icelandic eth, which follows the D. Five of the six vowels A, I, O, U and Y can get accents and are after that considered separate letters. The consonants C, Q, X, W and Z are not found. Therefore, the first five letters are A, Á, B, D and Ð, and the last five are V, Y, Ý, Æ, Ø
* In Filipino (Tagalog) and other Philippine languages, the letter Ng is treated as a separate letter. It is pronounced as in &quot;sing&quot;, &quot;ping-pong&quot;, etc. By itself, it is pronounced &quot;nang&quot;, but in general Filipino orthography, it is spelled as if it were two separate letters (n and g). Also, letter derivatives (such as Ñ) immediately follow the base letter. Filipino also is written with diacritics, but their use is very rare (except the tilde).
* The Finnish alphabet and collating rules are the same as those of Swedish.
* For French, the &quot;last&quot; accent in a given word determines the order. For example, in French, the following four words would be sorted this way: cote &lt; côte &lt; coté &lt; côté. The letter e is ordered as e é è ê ë (œ considered as oe), same thing for o as ô ö.
* In German letters with umlaut (Ä, Ö, Ü) are treated generally just like their non-umlauted versions; ß is always sorted as ss. This makes the alphabetic order Arbeit, Arg, Ärgerlich, Argument, Arm, Assistant, Aßlar, Assoziation. For phone directories and similar lists of names, the umlauts are to be collated like the letter combinations &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;oe&quot;, &quot;ue&quot; because a number of German surnames appear both with umlaut and in the non-umlauted form with &quot;e&quot; (Müller/Mueller). This makes the alphabetic order Udet, Übelacker, Uell, Ülle, Ueve, Üxküll, Uffenbach.
* The Hungarian vowels have accents, umlauts, and double accents, while consonants are written with single, double (digraphs) or triple (trigraph) characters. In collating, accented vowels are equivalent with their non-accented counterparts and double and triple characters follow their single originals. Hungarian alphabetic order is: A=Á, B, C, Cs, D, Dz, Dzs, E=É, F, G, Gy, H, I=Í, J, K, L, Ly, M, N, Ny, O=Ó, Ö=Ő, P, Q, R, S, Sz, T, Ty, U=Ú, Ü=Ű, V, W, X, Y, Z, Zs. (Before 1984, &quot;dz&quot; and &quot;dzs&quot; were not considered single letters for collation, but two letters each, d+z and d+zs instead.) It means that e.g. &quot;nádcukor&quot; should precede &quot;nádcsomó&quot; (even though &quot;s&quot; normally precedes &quot;u&quot;), since &quot;c&quot; precedes &quot;cs&quot; in the collation. Difference in vowel length should only be taken into consideration if the two words are otherwise identical (e.g. &quot;egér, éger&quot;). Spaces and hyphens within phrases are ignored in collation. &quot;Ch&quot; also occurs as a digraph in certain words but it is not considered as a grapheme on its own right in terms of collation.
*:A particular feature of Hungarian collation is that contracted forms of double di- and trigraphs (such as from &quot;gy + gy&quot; or from &quot;dzs + dzs&quot;) should be collated as if they were written in full (independently of the fact of the contraction and the elements of the di- or trigraphs). For example, &quot;kaszinó&quot; should precede &quot;kassza&quot; (even though the fourth character &quot;z&quot; would normally come after &quot;s&quot; in the alphabet), because the fourth &quot;character&quot; (grapheme) of the word &quot;kassza&quot; is considered a second &quot;sz&quot; (decomposing &quot;ssz&quot; into &quot;sz + sz&quot;), which does follow &quot;i&quot; (in &quot;kaszinó&quot;).
* In Icelandic, Þ is added, and D is followed by Ð. Each vowel (A, E, I, O, U, Y) is followed by its correspondent with acute: Á, É, Í, Ó, Ú, Ý. There is no Z, so the alphabet ends: ... X, Y, Ý, Þ, Æ, Ö.
** Both letters were also used by Anglo-Saxon scribes who also used the Runic letter Wynn to represent /w/.
** Þ (called thorn; lowercase þ) is also a Runic letter.
** Ð (called eth; lowercase ð) is the letter D with an added stroke.
* Kiowa is ordered on phonetic principles, like the Brahmic scripts, rather than on the historical Latin order. Vowels come first, then stop consonants ordered from the front to the back of the mouth, and from negative to positive voice-onset time, then the affricates, fricatives, liquids, and nasals:
:: A, AU, E, I, O, U, B, F, P, V, D, J, T, TH, G, C, K, Q, CH, X, S, Z, L, Y, W, H, M, N
* In Lithuanian, specifically Lithuanian letters go after their Latin originals. Another change is that Y comes just before J: ... G, H, I, Į, Y, J, K...
* In Maltese alphabet the digraphs GĦ and IE are treated as single letters, and each is listed after the first character of the pair. The dotted letters (Ċ Ġ Ż) are collated before their originals, while Ħ is after H. Accents, apostrophes and hyphens are ignored. However, when two words sort identically these diacritics are taken into consideration, such that accented letters follow non-accented.
* In Polish, specifically Polish letters derived from the Latin alphabet are collated after their originals: A, Ą, B, C, Ć, D, E, Ę, ..., L, Ł, M, N, Ń, O, Ó, P, ..., S, Ś, T, ..., Z, Ź, Ż. The digraphs for collation purposes are treated as if they were two separate letters.
* In Pinyin alphabetical order, where words have the same basic letters in pinyin and differ only in modifying diacritics, the unmodified letter comes before the modified letter. For example, comes before (額 (&quot;è&quot;) before 欸 (&quot;ê̄&quot;)), and comes before and (路 (&quot;lù&quot;) before 驢 (&quot;lǘ&quot;) and 努 (&quot;nǔ&quot;) before 女 (&quot;nǚ&quot;)). Characters with the same pinyin letters (including modified letters and ) are arranged according to their tones in the order of &quot;first tone (i.e., &quot;flat tone&quot;), second tone (rising tone), third tone (falling-rising tone), fourth tone (falling tone), fifth tone (neutral tone)&quot;, for example &quot;媽 (&quot;mā&quot;), 麻 (&quot;má&quot;), 馬 (&quot;mǎ&quot;), 罵 (&quot;mà&quot;), 嗎 (&quot;ma&quot;)&quot;.
* In Portuguese, the collating order is just like in English: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Digraphs and letters with diacritics are not included in the alphabet.
* In Romanian, special characters derived from the Latin alphabet are collated after their originals: A, Ă, Â, ..., I, Î, ..., S, Ș, T, Ț, ..., Z.
* In Serbo-Croatian and other related South Slavic languages, the five accented characters and three conjoined characters are sorted after the originals: ..., C, Č, Ć, D, DŽ, Đ, E, ..., L, LJ, M, N, NJ, O, ..., S, Š, T, ..., Z, Ž.
* Spanish treated (until 1994) &quot;CH&quot; and &quot;LL&quot; as single letters, giving an ordering of &quot;, , &quot; and &quot;, , .&quot; This is not true any more since in 1994 the RAE adopted the more conventional usage, and now LL is collated between LK and LM, and CH between CG and CI. The six characters with diacritics Á, É, Í, Ó, Ú, Ü are treated as the original letters A, E, I, O, U, for example: &quot;, , , , .&quot; The only Spanish-specific collating question is Ñ () as a different letter collated after N.
* In the Swedish alphabet, there are three extra vowels placed at its end (..., X, Y, Z, Å, Ä, Ö), similar to the Danish and Norwegian alphabet, but with different glyphs and a different collating order. The letter &quot;W&quot; has been treated as a variant of &quot;V&quot;, but in the 13th edition of &quot;Svenska Akademiens ordlista&quot; (2006) &quot;W&quot; was considered a separate letter.
* In the Turkish alphabet there are six additional letters: ç, ğ, ı, ö, ş, and ü (but no q, w, and x). They are collated with ç after c, ğ after g, ı &quot;before&quot; i, ö after o, ş after s, and ü after u. Originally, when the alphabet was introduced in 1928, ı was collated after i, but the order was changed later so that letters having shapes containing dots, cedilles or other adorning marks always follow the letters with corresponding bare shapes. Note that in Turkish orthography the letter I is the majuscule of dotless ı, whereas İ is the majuscule of dotted i.
* In many Turkic languages (such as Azeri or the Jaꞑalif orthography for Tatar), there used to be the letter Gha (Ƣƣ), which came between G and H. It is now in disuse.
* In Vietnamese, there are seven additional letters: ă, â, đ, ê, ô, ơ, ư while f, j, w, z are absent, even though they are still in some use (like Internet address, foreign loan language). &quot;f&quot; is replaced by the combination &quot;ph&quot;. The same as for &quot;w&quot; is &quot;qu&quot;.
* In Volapük ä, ö and ü are counted as separate letters and collated separately (a, ä, b ... o, ö, p ... u, ü, v) while q and w are absent.
* In Welsh the digraphs CH, DD, FF, NG, LL, PH, RH, and TH are treated as single letters, and each is listed after the first character of the pair (except for NG which is listed after G), producing the order A, B, C, CH, D, DD, E, F, FF, G, NG, H, and so on. It can sometimes happen, however, that word compounding results in the juxtaposition of two letters which do &quot;not&quot; form a digraph. An example is the word LLONGYFARCH (composed from LLON + GYFARCH). This results in such an ordering as, for example, LAWR, LWCUS, LLONG, LLOM, LLONGYFARCH (NG is a digraph in LLONG, but not in LLONGYFARCH). The letter combination R+H (as distinct from the digraph RH) may similarly arise by juxtaposition in compounds, although this tends not to produce any pairs in which misidentification could affect the ordering. For the other potentially confusing letter combinations that may occur – namely, D+D and L+L – a hyphen is used in the spelling (e.g. AD-DAL, CHWIL-LYS).

==Automation==

Collation algorithms (in combination with sorting algorithms) are used in computer programming to place strings in alphabetical order. A standard example is the Unicode Collation Algorithm, which can be used to put strings containing any Unicode symbols into (an extension of) alphabetical order. It can be made to conform to most of the language-specific conventions described above by tailoring its default collation table. Several such tailorings are collected in Common Locale Data Repository.

==Similar orderings==

The principle behind alphabetical ordering can still be applied in languages that do not strictly speaking use an alphabet – for example, they may be written using a syllabary or abugida – provided the symbols used have an established ordering.

For logographic writing systems, such as Chinese hanzi or Japanese kanji, the method of radical-and-stroke sorting is frequently used as a way of defining an ordering on the symbols. Japanese sometimes uses pronunciation order, most commonly with the Gojūon order but sometimes with the older Iroha ordering.

In mathematics, lexicographical order is a means of ordering sequences in a manner analogous to that used to produce alphabetical order.

Some computer applications use a version of alphabetical order that can be achieved using a very simple algorithm, based purely on the ASCII or Unicode codes for characters. This may have non-standard effects such as placing all capital letters before lower-case ones. See ASCIIbetical order.

A rhyming dictionary is based on sorting words in alphabetical order starting from the last to the first letter of the word.

<doc id="385981" wikidata="Q919122" url="?curid=385981" title="Joaquim Agostinho">
<text>Joaquim Fernandes Agostinho, (7 April 1943 – 10 May 1984) was a Portuguese professional bicycle racer. He was champion of Portugal in six successive years. He rode the Tour de France 13 times and finished all but once, winning on Alpe d&#x27;Huez in 1979, and finishing third twice. All total he finished in the top 10 of a Grand Tour eleven times, made three podiums and won a total of seven stages between the Vuelta and Tour.

==Youth==
Agostinho was born in a small village, near Torres Vedras. He lived for several years in Casalinhos de Alfaiata. Out for a ride as a youth, he encountered Sporting Clube de Portugal&#x27;s cycling team on a road near Casalinhos de Alfaiata – Torres Vedras. He began an impromptu race; the team could not catch him, even though Agostinho was riding a standard steel bicycle.

Agostinho fought for three years with the Portuguese army in Angola and Mozambique during the Portuguese Colonial War of 1961–1974. Jean-Pierre Douçot, who became his mechanic as a professional, said: 
&quot;It was his captain during the war in Mozambique who discovered him. When he carried messages on a heavy bike, he took two hours to ride 50km when the others took five.&quot;

==Racing career==

Joaquim Agostinho started racing as an amateur at the age of 25 years in some Portuguese races, wearing some borrowed cycling wear lent by João Roque. After winning some races, Agostinho signed a professional contract with Sporting Clube de Portugal. Then, when racing with the Sporting Clube de Portugal cycling team in São Paulo, Agostinho – a rider &quot;of average height but with the build of a rhinoceros&quot;, according to the historian Pierre Chany – left Jean de Gribaldy, a team manager and former cyclist, in awe of him. They met in Brazil in 1968, when Agostinho won the Tour de São Paulo. De Gribaldy was managing an amateur team in the race. That year Agostinho rode the world professional road championship at Imola and came 16th after initiating the move which brought victory for the Italian, Vittorio Adorni. De Gribaldy and Agostinho became lifelong friends. De Gribaldy said in 1980:

&quot;At the end of my life, if I had to recall a single place in the world, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate long. I would choose the little Brazilian hotel, insignificant, discreet, in São Paulo, where I had arranged to meet Joaquim. It was in 1968. I had noticed him two months earlier at Imola, at the world championship, but it was in São Paulo that I spoke to him for the first time. I asked him simply: &#x27;Do you want to come and race in France?&#x27; He didn&#x27;t know a word of French but in his smile I understood immediately what he was trying to answer. What a long way we went together afterwards. What memories we created together.&quot;

De Gribaldy asked him to join his Frimatic team in France, promising a ride in the 1969 Tour de France. Agostinho was already 26, a late age to turn professional, he won two stages that year. He also had one of the heavy falls that characterised his career, crashing on the cinder track at Divonne-les-Bains and being carried away with concussion, amnesia and cuts. He restarted next morning and rode as far as Paris, finishing the race eighth. He rode 13 Tours de France from 1969 to 1983, came third in 1978 and 1979 and won four stages. He finished 12 times.

Agostinho stayed with de Gribaldy as his teams were successively sponsored by Frimatic, Hoover, and Van Cauter Magniflex. In 1973 he left de Gribaldy to ride for Bic and then Teka before re-associating with de Gribaldy when he joined Flandria&#x27;s French team in 1978.

Raphaël Géminiani said: &quot;Joaquim Agostinho didn&#x27;t know his own strength. He was a ball of muscles of out-of-the-ordinary power. He was built like a cast-iron founder. Having come to cycling fairly late, he had trouble integrating with it. It&#x27;s a shame he didn&#x27;t want to dedicate himself 100 per cent to being a professional cyclist. Now and then he showed his very great physical powers, but no more often than that. He didn&#x27;t want to do more. The peloton scared him, which is why he fell so often. More than that, Tinho was never aggressive enough to impose himself totally. He had a legendary kindness and his only ambition was to be good, gentle Tinho. If he&#x27;d been ambitious, he would easily have written his name into the records of the Tour de France.&quot;

Pierre Martin said in &quot;International Cycle Sport&quot;: He was a man of strange contradictions. Built like a sprinter, he was no good at sprinting. He was one of the great climbers. Eddy Merckx said in 1969, the year when he and Agostinho made their debuts in the Tour de France, that Agostinho was the rival who worried him most, indeed the only rival who had worried him at all.&quot;

Agostinho was Portuguese champion in six successive years, from 1968 to 1973. He was a gifted climber and a consistent leader in both in the Vuelta a España and the Tour de France where he was a winner at Alpe d&#x27;Huez. Martin said:

&quot;He loved the Tour de France. There were few other races which he took seriously, indeed he raced relatively little during an average season – enough to pay for and maintain life&#x27;s dream, but no more. On the roads of the Tour, nobody ever knew when he would suddenly burst into action. He might be quiet for days on end, when suddenly the racing fever would grip him, not always in the mountains, and away he went. When he went, those with serious ambitions went with him, knowing that, otherwise, they would see him no more until the end of the stage. He didn&#x27;t take cycling too seriously. It had brought him wealth and security, had allowed him to buy and stock a large farm about 20 miles from Lisbon. The farm and his family were his life; cycling was his hobby. When he was riding the Tour d&#x27;Indre-et-Loire once, news reached him that 20 cows had been stolen. Off he went, in mid-race, back to Portugal to organise a posse to hunt the cattle, chartering a light plane for himself to direct the search.

In 1982 he took a whole year off to look after his farm, demoralised by a fall in form the previous season.

==Doping==
Joaquim Agostinho was caught three times in drugs checks: in the Tour of Portugal in 1969 and 1973, and the Tour de France of 1977.

==Death==
Agostinho was leading the Tour of the Algarve at Quarteira in April 1984 when a dog ran into the road a few hundred metres before the finish. Agostinho hit it and fell to the ground, hitting his head. He remounted and crossed the line accompanied by other riders. He was dazed but seemed otherwise unhurt. He walked to an ambulance, holding his head. He then went to a hotel, where his head was dressed in ice. Two hours later he was taken to hospital in Faro, where an X-ray showed he had broken the parietal bone in his skull. He was conveyed by ambulance, four hours after the fall, 280 km to Lisbon, the nearest city that could treat him. He fell into a coma in the ambulance and subsequently died.

==Monuments &amp; tributes==

* In Torres Vedras, on top of the Parque Verde da Várzea, there is a monument built in honour of Joaquim Agostinho.
* In the gardens of Silveira a monument was inaugurated on 14 May 1989.
* The &#x27;Avenida Joaquim Agostinho&#x27; (avenue) leads to the centre the Santa Cruz Beach.
* In France, on the 14th curve of the Alpe d&#x27;Huez, a bronze bust (1.70 m high, 70 cm wide and weighing 70 kg), mounted on a granite pedestal three feet high, commemorates his stage victory in 1979.
* In 2000 the journalists of &quot;A Bola&quot; selected Agostinho as the 4th most important Portuguese Sportsman of the 20th Century, behind Eusébio (1st), Carlos Lopes (2nd) and Rosa Mota (3rd).
* In 1984 Agostinho was made an Officer of the Order of Prince Henry the Navigator, by then President of Portugal Ramalho Eanes.

<doc id="385982" wikidata="Q13690522" url="?curid=385982" title="Irreducible representation">
<text>In mathematics, specifically in the representation theory of groups and algebras, an irreducible representation formula_1 or irrep of an algebraic structure formula_2 is a nonzero representation that has no proper nontrivial subrepresentation formula_3, with formula_4 closed under the action of formula_5.

Every finite-dimensional unitary representation on a Hilbert space formula_6 is the direct sum of irreducible representations. Irreducible representations are always indecomposable (i.e. cannot be decomposed further into a direct sum of representations), but the converse may not hold, e.g. the two-dimensional representation of the real numbers acting by upper triangular unipotent matrices is indecomposable but reducible.

==History==

Group representation theory was generalized by Richard Brauer from the 1940s to give modular representation theory, in which the matrix operators act on a vector space over a field formula_7 of arbitrary characteristic, rather than a vector space over the field of real numbers or over the field of complex numbers. The structure analogous to an irreducible representation in the resulting theory is a simple module.

==Overview==

Let formula_8 be a representation i.e. a homomorphism formula_9 of a group formula_10 where formula_6 is a vector space over a field formula_12. If we pick a basis formula_13 for formula_6, formula_8 can be thought of as a function (a homomorphism) from a group into a set of invertible matrices and in this context is called a matrix representation. However, it simplifies things greatly if we think of the space formula_6 without a basis. formula_8 is d-dimensional if the vector space formula_6 it acts over has dimension formula_19.

A linear subspace formula_20 is called formula_10-invariant if formula_22 for all formula_23 and all formula_24. The co-restriction of formula_8 to the general linear group of a formula_10-invariant subspace formula_20 is known as a subrepresentation. A representation formula_9 is said to be irreducible if it has only trivial subrepresentations (all representations can form a subrepresentation with the trivial formula_10-invariant subspaces, e.g. the whole vector space formula_6, and {0}). If there is a proper nontrivial invariant subspace, formula_8 is said to be reducible.

===Notation and terminology of group representations===

Group elements can be represented by matrices, although the term &quot;represented&quot; has a specific and precise meaning in this context. A representation of a group is a mapping from the group elements to the general linear group of matrices. As notation, let denote elements of a group with group product signified without any symbol, so is the group product of and and is also an element of , and let representations be indicated by . The representation of &quot;a&quot; is written as

:formula_32

By definition of group representations, the representation of a group product is translated into matrix multiplication of the representations:

:formula_33

If is the identity element of the group (so that , etc.), then is an identity matrix, or identically a block matrix of identity matrices, since we must have

:formula_34

and similarly for all other group elements. The last two statements correspond to the requirement that is a group homomorphism.

=== Reducible and irreducible representations ===
A representation is reducible if it contains a nontrivial G-invariant subspace, that is to say, all the matrices formula_35 can be put in upper triangular block form by the same invertible matrix formula_36. In other words, if there is a similarity transformation:
:formula_37
which maps every matrix in the representation into the same pattern upper triangular blocks. Every ordered sequence minor block is a group subrepresentation. That is to say, if the representation is, for example, of dimension 2, then we have:
formula_38

where formula_39 is a nontrivial subrepresentation. If we are able to find a matrix formula_40 that makes formula_41 as well, then formula_35 is not only reducible but also decomposable.

Notice: Even if a representation is reducible, its matrix representation may still not be the upper triangular block form. It will only have this form if we choose a suitable basis, which can be obtained by applying the matrix formula_43 above to the standard basis.

===Decomposable and indecomposable representations===

A representation is decomposable if all the matrices formula_35 can be put in block-diagonal form by the same invertible matrix formula_36. In other words, if there is a similarity transformation:

:formula_37

which diagonalizes every matrix in the representation into the same pattern of diagonal blocks. Each such block is then a group subrepresentation independent from the others. The representations and are said to be equivalent representations. The (&quot;k&quot;-dimensional, say) representation can be decomposed into a direct sum of matrices:

:formula_47

so is decomposable, and it is customary to label the decomposed matrices by a superscript in brackets, as in for , although some authors just write the numerical label without parentheses.

The dimension of is the sum of the dimensions of the blocks:

:formula_48

If this is not possible, i.e. , then the representation is indecomposable.

Notice: Even if a representation is decomposable, its matrix representation may not be the diagonal block form. It will only have this form if we choose a suitable basis, which can be obtained by applying the matrix formula_43 above to the standard basis.

=== Connection between irreducible representation and indecomposable representation ===
An irreducible representation is by nature an indecomposable one. However, the converse may fail.

But under some conditions, we do have an indecomposable representation being an irreducible representation.

* When group formula_10 is finite, and it has a representation over field formula_51, then an indecomposable representation is an irreducible representation.
* When group formula_10 is finite, and it has a representation over field formula_7, if we have formula_54, then an indecomposable representation is an irreducible representation.

==Examples of irreducible representations==

===Trivial representation===
All groups formula_10 have a zero-dimensional, irreducible trivial representation by mapping all group elements to the identity transformation.

=== One-dimensional representation ===
Any one-dimensional representation is irreducible since it has no proper nontrivial invariant subspaces.

===Irreducible complex representations===

The irreducible complex representations of a finite group G can be characterized using results from character theory. In particular, all complex representations decompose as a direct sum of irreps, and the number of irreps of formula_10 is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of formula_10.

* The irreducible complex representations of formula_58 are exactly given by the maps formula_59, where formula_60 is an formula_61th root of unity.
* Let formula_6 be an formula_61-dimensional complex representation of formula_64 with basis formula_65. Then formula_6 decomposes as a direct sum of the irreps formula_67 and the orthogonal subspace given by formula_68 The former irrep is one-dimensional and isomorphic to the trivial representation of formula_64. The latter is formula_70 dimensional and is known as the standard representation of formula_64.
* Let formula_10 be a group. The regular representation of formula_10 is the free complex vector space on the basis formula_74 with the group action formula_75, denoted formula_76 All irreducible representations of formula_10 appear in the decomposition of formula_78 as a direct sum of irreps.

===Example of an irreducible representation over ===
*Let formula_10 be a formula_80 group and formula_81 be a finite dimensional irreducible representation of G over formula_82. By Orbit-stabilizer theorem, the orbit of every formula_6 element acted by the formula_80 group formula_10 has size being power of formula_80. Since the sizes of all these orbits sum up to the size of formula_10, and formula_88 is in a size 1 orbit only containing itself, there must be other orbits of size 1 for the sum to match. That is, there exists some formula_89 such that formula_90 for all formula_91. This forces every irreducible representation of a formula_80 group over formula_93 to be one dimensional.

==Applications in theoretical physics and chemistry==

In quantum physics and quantum chemistry, each set of degenerate eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator comprises a vector space for a representation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, a &quot;multiplet&quot;, best studied through reduction to its irreducible parts. Identifying the irreducible representations therefore allows one to label the states, predict how they will split under perturbations; or transition to other states in . Thus, in quantum mechanics, irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the system partially or completely label the energy levels of the system, allowing the selection rules to be determined.

== Lie groups ==

===Lorentz group===
The irreps of and , where is the generator of rotations and the generator of boosts, can be used to build to spin representations of the Lorentz group, because they are related to the spin matrices of quantum mechanics. This allows them to derive relativistic wave equations.

<doc id="385989" wikidata="Q1057416" url="?curid=385989" title="Eisenstein's criterion">
<text>In mathematics, Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion gives a sufficient condition for a polynomial with integer coefficients to be irreducible over the rational numbers – that is, for it to not be factorizable into the product of non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients.

This criterion is not applicable to all polynomials with integer coefficients that are irreducible over the rational numbers, but it does allow in certain important cases for irreducibility to be proved with very little effort. It may apply either directly or after transformation of the original polynomial.

This criterion is named after Gotthold Eisenstein. In the early 20th century, it was also known as the Schönemann–Eisenstein theorem because Theodor Schönemann was the first to publish it.

==Criterion==

Suppose we have the following polynomial with integer coefficients:
formula_1

If there exists a prime number such that the following three conditions all apply:

* divides each for ,
* does &quot;not&quot; divide , and
* does &quot;not&quot; divide ,

then is irreducible over the rational numbers. It will also be irreducible over the integers, unless all its coefficients have a nontrivial factor in common (in which case as integer polynomial will have some prime number, necessarily distinct from , as an irreducible factor). The latter possibility can be avoided by first making primitive, by dividing it by the greatest common divisor of its coefficients (the content of ). This division does not change whether is reducible or not over the rational numbers (see Primitive part–content factorization for details), and will not invalidate the hypotheses of the criterion for (on the contrary it could make the criterion hold for some prime, even if it did not before the division).

==Examples==

Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion may apply either directly (i.e., using the original polynomial) or after transformation of the original polynomial.

===Direct (without transformation)===

Consider the polynomial . In order for Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion to apply for a prime number it must divide both non-leading coefficients and , which means only could work, and indeed it does since does not divide the leading coefficient , and its square does not divide the constant coefficient . One may therefore conclude that is irreducible over (and, since it is primitive, over as well). Note that since is of degree 4, this conclusion could not have been established by only checking that has no rational roots (which eliminates possible factors of degree 1), since a decomposition into two quadratic factors could also be possible.

===Indirect (after transformation)===

Often Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion does not apply for any prime number. It may however be that it applies (for some prime number) to the polynomial obtained after substitution (for some integer ) of for . The fact that the polynomial after substitution is irreducible then allows concluding that the original polynomial is as well. This procedure is known as applying a &quot;shift&quot;.

For example consider , in which the coefficient 1 of is not divisible by any prime, Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion does not apply to . But if one substitutes for in , one obtains the polynomial , which satisfies Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion for the prime number . Since the substitution is an automorphism of the ring , the fact that we obtain an irreducible polynomial after substitution implies that we had an irreducible polynomial originally. In this particular example it would have been simpler to argue that (being monic of degree 2) could only be reducible if it had an integer root, which it obviously does not; however the general principle of trying substitutions in order to make Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion apply is a useful way to broaden its scope.

Another possibility to transform a polynomial so as to satisfy the criterion, which may be combined with applying a shift, is reversing the order of its coefficients, provided its constant term is nonzero (without which it would be divisible by anyway). This is so because such polynomials are reducible in if and only if they are reducible in (for any integral domain ), and in that ring the substitution of for reverses the order of the coefficients (in a manner symmetric about the constant coefficient, but a following shift in the exponent amounts to multiplication by a unit). As an example satisfies the criterion for after reversing its coefficients, and (being primitive) is therefore irreducible in .

=== Cyclotomic polynomials ===

An important class of polynomials whose irreducibility can be established using Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion is that of the cyclotomic polynomials for prime numbers . Such a polynomial is obtained by dividing the polynomial by the linear factor , corresponding to its obvious root (which is its only rational root if ):
formula_2

Here, as in the earlier example of , the coefficients prevent Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion from applying directly. However the polynomial will satisfy the criterion for after substitution of for : this gives
formula_3
all of whose non-leading coefficients are divisible by by properties of binomial coefficients, and whose constant coefficient is equal to , and therefore not divisible by . An alternative way to arrive at this conclusion is to use the identity which is valid in characteristic (and which is based on the same properties of binomial coefficients, and gives rise to the Frobenius endomorphism), to compute the reduction modulo of the quotient of polynomials:
formula_4
which means that the non-leading coefficients of the quotient are all divisible by ; the remaining verification that the constant term of the quotient is can be done by substituting (instead of ) for into the expanded form .

==History==

Theodor Schönemann was the first to publish a version of the criterion, in 1846 in Crelle&#x27;s Journal, which reads in translation

That will be irreducible to the modulus when to the modulus does not contain a factor .

This formulation already incorporates a shift to in place of ; the condition on means that is not divisible by , and so is divisible by but not by . As stated it is not entirely correct in that it makes no assumptions on the degree of the polynomial , so that the polynomial considered need not be of the degree that its expression suggests; the example , shows the conclusion is not valid without such hypothesis. Assuming that the degree of does not exceed , the criterion is correct however, and somewhat stronger than the formulation given above, since if is irreducible modulo , it certainly cannot decompose in into non-constant factors.

Subsequently Eisenstein published a somewhat different version in 1850, also in Crelle&#x27;s Journal. This version reads in translation

When in a polynomial in of arbitrary degree the coefficient of the highest term is , and all following coefficients are whole (real, complex) numbers, into which a certain (real resp. complex) prime number divides, and when furthermore the last coefficient is equal to , where denotes a number not divisible by : then it is impossible to bring into the form formula_5 where , , and all and are &quot;whole&quot; (real resp. complex) numbers; the equation is therefore irreducible.

Here &quot;whole real numbers&quot; are ordinary integers and &quot;whole complex numbers&quot; are Gaussian integers; one should similarly interpret &quot;real and complex prime numbers&quot;. The application for which Eisenstein developed his criterion was establishing the irreducibility of certain polynomials with coefficients in the Gaussian integers that arise in the study of the division of the lemniscate into pieces of equal arc-length.

Remarkably Schönemann and Eisenstein, once having formulated their respective criteria for irreducibility, both immediately apply it to give an elementary proof of the irreducibility of the cyclotomic polynomials for prime numbers, a result that Gauss had obtained in his &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot; with a much more complicated proof. In fact, Eisenstein adds in a footnote that the only proof for this irreducibility known to him, other than that of Gauss, is one given by Kronecker in 1845. This shows that he was unaware of the two different proofs of this statement that Schönemann had given in his 1846 article, where the second proof was based on the above-mentioned criterion. This is all the more surprising given the fact that two pages further, Eisenstein actually refers (for a different matter) to the first part of Schönemann&#x27;s article. In a note (&quot;Notiz&quot;) that appeared in the following issue of the Journal, Schönemann points this out to Eisenstein, and indicates that the latter&#x27;s method is not essentially different from the one he used in the second proof.

==Basic proof==

To prove the validity of the criterion, suppose satisfies the criterion for the prime number , but that it is nevertheless reducible in , from which we wish to obtain a contradiction. From Gauss&#x27; lemma it follows that is reducible in as well, and in fact can be written as the product of two non-constant polynomials (in case is not primitive, one applies the lemma to the primitive polynomial (where the integer is the content of ) to obtain a decomposition for it, and multiplies into one of the factors to obtain a decomposition for ). Now reduce modulo to obtain a decomposition in . But by hypothesis this reduction for leaves its leading term, of the form for a non-zero constant , as the only nonzero term. But then necessarily the reductions modulo of and also make all non-leading terms vanish (and cannot make their leading terms vanish), since no other decompositions of are possible in , which is a unique factorization domain. In particular the constant terms of and vanish in the reduction, so they are divisible by , but then the constant term of , which is their product, is divisible by , contrary to the hypothesis, and one has a contradiction.

A second proof of Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion also starts with the assumption that the polynomial is reducible. It is shown that this assumption entails a contradiction.

The assumption that 
formula_6
is reducible means that there are polynomials 
formula_7
Such that
formula_8
The coefficient of the polynomial can be divided by the prime but not by . Since , it is possible to divide or by , but not both. One may without loss of generality proceed 

*with a coefficient that can be divided by and
*with a coefficient that cannot be divided by .

By the assumption, formula_9 does not divide formula_10. Because , neither nor can be divided by . Thus, if formula_11 is the formula_12-th coefficient of the reducible polynomial formula_13, then (possibly with formula_14 in case formula_15)
formula_16
wherein formula_17 cannot be divided by formula_9, because neither formula_19 nor formula_20 can be divided by formula_9.

We will prove that formula_22 are all divisible by . As formula_11 is also divisible by (by hypothesis of the criterion), this implies that 
formula_24 
is divisible by , a contradiction proving the criterion.

It is possible to divide formula_25 by formula_9, because formula_27 can be divided by formula_9.

By initial assumption, it is possible to divide the coefficient of the polynomial by . Since
formula_29
and since is not a multiple of it must be possible to divide by . Analogously, by induction, formula_30 is a multiple of formula_9 for all formula_32, which finishes the proof.

==Advanced explanation==

Applying the theory of the Newton polygon for the -adic number field, for an Eisenstein polynomial, we are supposed to take the lower convex envelope of the points

where is the -adic valuation of (i.e. the highest power of dividing it). Now the data we are given on the for , namely that they are at least one, is just what we need to conclude that the lower convex envelope is exactly the single line segment from to , the slope being .

This tells us that each root of has -adic valuation and hence that is irreducible over the -adic field (since, for instance, no product of any proper subset of the roots has integer valuation); and &quot;a fortiori&quot; over the rational number field.

This argument is much more complicated than the direct argument by reduction mod . It does however allow one to see, in terms of algebraic number theory, how frequently Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion might apply, after some change of variable; and so limit severely the possible choices of with respect to which the polynomial could have an Eisenstein translate (that is, become Eisenstein after an additive change of variables as in the case of the -th cyclotomic polynomial).

In fact only primes ramifying in the extension of generated by a root of have any chance of working. These can be found in terms of the discriminant of . For example, in the case given above, the discriminant is so that is the only prime that has a chance of making it satisfy the criterion. Modulo , it becomes — a repeated root is inevitable, since the discriminant is . Therefore the variable shift is actually something predictable.

Again, for the cyclotomic polynomial, it becomes

the discriminant can be shown to be (up to sign) , by linear algebra methods.

More precisely, only totally ramified primes have a chance of being Eisenstein primes for the polynomial. (In quadratic fields, ramification is always total, so the distinction is not seen in the quadratic case like above.) In fact, Eisenstein polynomials are directly linked to totally ramified primes, as follows: if a field extension of the rationals is generated by the root of a polynomial that is Eisenstein at then is totally ramified in the extension, and conversely if is totally ramified in a number field then the field is generated by the root of an Eisenstein polynomial at .

==Generalization==

===Generalized criterion===

Given an integral domain , let
formula_33
be an element of , the polynomial ring with coefficients in .

Suppose there exists a prime ideal of such that

* for each ,
* , and
* , where is the ideal product of with itself.

Then cannot be written as a product of two non-constant polynomials in . If in addition is primitive (i.e., it has no non-trivial &quot;constant&quot; divisors), then it is irreducible in . If is a unique factorization domain with field of fractions , then by Gauss&#x27;s lemma is irreducible in , whether or not it is primitive (since constant factors are invertible in ); in this case a possible choice of prime ideal is the principal ideal generated by any irreducible element of . The latter statement gives original theorem for or (in Eisenstein&#x27;s formulation) for .

===Proof===

The proof of this generalization is similar to the one for the original statement, considering the reduction of the coefficients modulo ; the essential point is that a single-term polynomial over the integral domain cannot decompose as a product in which at least one of the factors has more than one term (because in such a product there can be no cancellation in the coefficient either of the highest or the lowest possible degree).

===Example===

After , one of the basic examples of an integral domain is the polynomial ring in the variable over the field . In this case, the principal ideal generated by is a prime ideal. Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion can then be used to prove the irreducibility of a polynomial such as in . Indeed, does not divide , does not divide , and divides and . This shows that this polynomial satisfies the hypotheses of the generalization of Eisenstein&#x27;s criterion for the prime ideal since, for a principal ideal , being an element of is equivalent to being divisible by .

<text>The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) is the principal security agency of Russia and the main successor agency to the Soviet Union&#x27;s KGB; its immediate predecessor was the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK) which was reorganized into the FSB in 1995. The three major structural successor components of the former KGB that remain administratively independent of the FSB are the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), the Federal Protective Service (FSO), and the Main Directorate of Special Programs of the President of the Russian Federation (GUSP).

The primary responsibilities are within the country and include counter-intelligence, internal and border security, counterterrorism, surveillance and investigating some other types of serious crimes and federal law violations. It is headquartered in Lubyanka Square, Moscow&#x27;s center, in the main building of the former KGB. The director of the FSB is appointed by and directly answerable to the president of Russia. Being part of Russia&#x27;s executive branch formally, the FSB has significant, if not decisive, power over it.

In 2003, the FSB&#x27;s responsibilities were expanded by incorporating the Border Guard Service and a major part of the Federal Agency of Government Communication and Information (FAPSI); this would include intelligence activities in countries that were once members of the Soviet Union, work formerly done by the KGB&#x27;s Fifth Service. The SVR had in 1992 signed an agreement not to spy on those countries; the FSB had made no such commitment.

==History==
===Initial recognition of the KGB===

The Federal Security Service (FSB or FSS) ( [ФСБ, ФСБ России], ) is one of the successor organizations of the Soviet Committee of State Security (KGB). Following the attempted coup of 1991—in which some KGB units as well as the KGB head Vladimir Kryuchkov played a major part—the KGB was dismantled and ceased to exist from November 1991.

In December 1991, two government agencies answerable to the Russian president were created by President Yeltsin&#x27;s decrees on the basis of the relevant main directorates of the defunct KGB: Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia) (SVR, the former First Main Directorate) and the Federal Agency of Government Communications and Information (FAPSI, merging the functions of the former 8th Main Directorate and 16th Main Directorate of the KGB). In January 1992, another new institution, the Ministry of Security, took over domestic and border security responsibilities. Following the 1993 constitutional crisis, the Ministry of Security was reorganized on 21 December 1993 into the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service (FSK). The FSK was headed by Sergei Stepashin. Before the start of the First Chechen War&#x27;s main military activities, the FSK was responsible for the covert operations against the separatists led by Dzhokhar Dudayev.

===Creation of the FSB===

In 1995, the FSK was renamed and reorganized into the Federal Security Service (FSB) by the Federal Law &quot;On the Federal Security Service&quot; (the title of the law as amended in June 2003) signed by the president on 3 April 1995. The FSB reforms were rounded out by decree No. 633, signed by Boris Yeltsin on 23 June 1995. The decree made the tasks of the FSB more specific, giving the FSB substantial rights to conduct cryptographic work, and described the powers of the FSB director. The number of deputy directors was increased to eight: two first deputies, five deputies responsible for departments and directorates and one deputy director heading the Moscow City and Moscow regional directorate. Yeltsin appointed Colonel-General Mikhail Ivanovich Barsukov as the new director of the FSB. In 1998, Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin, a KGB veteran who would later succeed Yeltsin as federal president, as director of the FSB. Putin was reluctant to take over the directorship, but once appointed conducted a thorough reorganization, which included the dismissal of most of the FSB&#x27;s top personnel. Putin appointed Nikolai Patrushev as the head of FSB in 1999.

===Role in the Second Chechen War===
After the main military offensive of the Second Chechen War ended and the separatists changed tactics to guerilla warfare, overall command of the federal forces in Chechnya was transferred from the military to the FSB in January 2001. While the army lacked technical means of tracking the guerrilla groups, the FSB suffered from insufficient human intelligence due to its inability to build networks of agents and informants. In the autumn of 2002, the separatists launched a massive campaign of terrorism against the Russian civilians, including the Dubrovka theatre attack. The inability of the federal forces to conduct efficient counterterrorist operations led to the government to transfer the responsibility of &quot;maintaining order&quot; in Chechnya from the FSB to the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) in July 2003.

===Putin reforms===

After becoming president, Vladimir Putin launched a major reorganization of the FSB. First, the FSB was placed under direct control of the President by a decree issued on 17 May 2000. The internal structure of the agency was reformed by a decree signed on 17 June 2000. In the resulting structure, the FSB was to have a director, a first deputy director and nine other deputy directors, including one possible state secretary and the chiefs of six departments: Economic Security Department, Counterintelligence Department, Organizational and Personnel Service, Department of activity provision, Department for Analysis, Forecasting and Strategic Planning, Department for Protection of the Constitutional System and the Fight against Terrorism.

In 2003, the agency&#x27;s responsibilities were considerably widened. The Border Guard Service of Russia, with its staff of 210,000, was integrated to the FSB via a decree signed on 11 March 2003. The merger was completed by 1 July 2003. In addition, The Federal Agency of Government Communication and Information (FAPSI) was abolished, and the FSB was granted a major part of its functions, while other parts went to the Ministry of Defense. Among the reasons for this strengthening of the FSB were the enhanced need for security after increased terror attacks against Russian civilians starting with the Moscow theater hostage crisis; the need to end the permanent infighting between the FSB, FAPSI and the Border Guards due to their overlapping functions; and the need for more efficient response to migration, drug trafficking and illegal arms trading. In addition, the FSB was the sole power base of the new president, so the restructuring strengthened his position (see Political groups under Vladimir Putin&#x27;s presidency).

On 28 June 2004, in a speech to high-ranking FSB officers, Putin emphasized three major tasks of the agency: neutralizing foreign espionage, safeguarding the economic and financial security of the country, and combating organized crime. In September 2006, the FSB was shaken up by a major reshuffle. Combined with some earlier reassignments – most notably those of FSB Deputy Directors Yury Zaostrovtsev and Vladimir Anisimov in 2004 and 2005 – the changes were widely believed to be linked to the Three Whales Corruption Scandal that had slowly unfolded since 2000. Some analysts considered the changes to be an attempt to undermine FSB Director Nikolay Patrushev&#x27;s influence, as his team from the Karelian KGB Directorate of the late 1980s  to early 1990s suffered most, and he had been on vacations during the events.

By 2008, the agency had one Director, two First Deputy Directors and 5 Deputy Directors. It had the following 9 divisions:
#Counter-Espionage
#Service for Defense of Constitutional Order and Fight against Terrorism
#Border Service
#Economic Security Service
#Current Information and International Links
#Organizational and Personnel Service
#Monitoring Department
#Scientific and Technical Service
#Organizational Security Service

===Counterterrorist operations===
Beginning with the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002, Russia was faced with increased levels of terrorism. FSB Spetsnaz units Alpha Group and Vympel played a key role in hostage rescue operations during the Moscow theater siege and the Beslan school siege. Their performance was criticised due to the high number of hostage casualties. In 2006, the FSB successfully killed Shamil Basayev, who was behind the Beslan tragedy and several other high-profile terrorist acts. According to the FSB, the operation was planned over six months and made possible due to the FSB&#x27;s increased activities in foreign countries that were supplying arms to the terrorists. Basayev was tracked via surveillance of this arms trafficking. He and other militants were preparing to carry out a terrorist attack in Ingushetia when FSB agents destroyed their convoy; 12 militants were killed.

During the last years of the Vladimir Putin&#x27;s second presidency (2006–2008), terrorist attacks in Russia dwindled, falling from 257 in 2005 to 48 in 2007. Military analyst Vitaly Shlykov praised the effectiveness of Russia&#x27;s security agencies, saying that the experience learned in Chechnya and Dagestan had been key to the success. In 2008, the American Carnegie Endowment&#x27;s Foreign Policy magazine named Russia as &quot;the worst place to be a terrorist&quot; and highlighted especially Russia&#x27;s willingness to prioritize national security over civil rights. By 2010, Russian forces led by the FSB had managed to eliminate the top level leadership of the Chechen insurgency, except for Dokka Umarov.

===Increased terrorism and expansion of the FSB&#x27;s powers===

Starting from 2009, the level of terrorism in Russia increased again, particularly suicide attacks. Between February 2005 and August 2008, no civilians were killed in such attacks. In 2008, at least 17 were killed, and in 2009 the number rose to 45.

In March 2010, Islamist militants organised the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings, which killed 40 people. One of the two blasts took place at Lubyanka station, near the FSB headquarters. Militant leader Doku Umarov—dubbed &quot;Russia&#x27;s Osama Bin Laden&quot;—took responsibility for the attacks.

In July 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev expanded the FSB&#x27;s powers in its fight against terrorism. FSB officers received the power to issue warnings to citizens on actions that could lead to committing crimes and arrest people for 15 days if they fail to comply with legitimate orders given by the officers. The bill was harshly criticized by human rights organizations.

===Role in Ukraine===
Since 2014, the FSB devoted substantial resources to preparing for a Russian takeover of Ukraine. Although Russia&#x27;s SVR and GRU (foreign and military intelligence services) were also involved, FSB had a lead role on &quot;intelligence and influence operations&quot;.

The FSB&#x27;s Fifth Service, also referred to as the &quot;Department for Operational Information&quot; and &quot;Operational Information and International Relations Service&quot; is stated by the BBC and Radio Free Europe as counterintelligence in former territories of the Soviet Union, work formerly done by the KGB&#x27;s Fifth Service. Its Ninth Directorate of the Fifth Service targets Ukraine. Putin was persuaded to invade Ukraine by a small group of his closest associates, especially Nikolai Patrushev, Yury Kovalchuk and Alexander Bortnikov. According to some experts, Bortnikov played a key role in Putin&#x27;s decision to invade Ukraine.

According to a report of the Royal United Services Institute citing interviews officers and analysts of Security Service of Ukraine, the FSB Ukraine team greatly expanded July 2021, and by February 2022 it had &quot;around 200 officers&quot; although most teams consist of only 10–20. Before the 2022 invasion, intelligence agencies in Ukraine, Germany, the UK, and the US reported that the FSB planned to replace elected leaders of Ukraine with Ukrainians now living in Russia.

In 2014, according to a Russian military analyst, the FSB badly misled Putin with claims that Ukrainians would welcome a Russian invasion of Crimea to free them from &quot;fascists&quot;. According to &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot;, in 2022, the FSB again promised easy victory if Russia invaded Ukraine.
With the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian counterintelligence has repeatedly asserted that the FSB suffered failures of operations security, including acts of insubordination and possible sabotage. In March 2022, Russia&#x27;s encrypted communication system in Ukraine became useless after the Russian military destroyed cellphone towers; unencrypted phone calls from the FSB in Ukraine to superiors in Moscow discussing the death of Vitaly Gerasimov were tapped and released publicly. Ukrainian intelligence reported that FSB members were leaking intelligence to them, including the location of the Chechen commandos sent to assassinate Zelensky. In late March, Ukrainian intelligence posted online the names, addresses, phone numbers, and more of 620 people they identified as FSB agents. None of these reports have been confirmed by the FSB.

Media outlets of Ukraine, its allies in the West, and Russian dissidents report that Vladimir Putin has blamed setbacks in the military operations on the FSB and the Fifth Service. On 11 March 2022, investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov reported that Fifth Service head Sergey Beseda and his deputy, Anatoly Bolyukh were under house arrest due to Putin&#x27;s discontent with intelligence failures regarding the invasion of Ukraine. A U.S. official interviewed by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described the arrest report as &quot;credible&quot;.

On 11 April 2022, the &quot;Times of London&quot;, citing unnamed sources who had spoken to Bellingcat executive director Christo Grozev, reported that Beseda was transferred to Lefortovo Prison, the scene of mass executions during Stalin&#x27;s purges. The same report claims that up over 100 FSB agents from the Fifth Service had been sacked. The &quot;Times of London&quot; also reports that &quot;it is thought that&quot; the Fifth Service is now headed by Beseda&#x27;s former subordinate, Grigory Grishaev.

According to an article in the 11 April 2022 issue of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;:Several current and former officials described the Russian security service as rife with corruption, beset by bureaucratic bloat and ultimately out of touch. A Ukrainian intelligence official said the FSB had spent millions recruiting a network of pro-Russian collaborators who ultimately told Putin and his top advisers, among them the current FSB director, what they wanted to hear.

A series of alleged leaked letters from FSB analysts, made public after the invasion began, report the same kind of problem. For example: &quot;You have to write the analysis in a way that makes Russia the victor ... otherwise you get questioned for not doing good work.&quot;

Russian-American ballet dancer Ksenia Karelina was arrested in early 2024 in Yekaterinburg and charged with &quot;treason&quot; for sending $51.80 to Razom, a New York City-based nonprofit organization that sends humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. The FSB accused Karelina of taking part in &quot;public actions to support the Kyiv regime.&quot; She initially faced life in prison, but pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years in prison. 

In August 2024, a &quot;counter-terrorism&quot; operational regime under the FSB was introduced in Kursk, Bryansk and Belgorod Oblasts. This means in practice that &quot;movement is restricted, vehicles can be seized, phone calls can be monitored, areas are declared no-go zones, checkpoints introduced, and security is beefed up at key infrastructure sites.&quot;

==Function==
===Counterintelligence===

In 2011, the FSB said it had exposed 199 foreign spies, including 41 professional spies and 158 agents employed by foreign intelligence services. The number has risen in recent years: in 2006 the FSB reportedly caught about 27 foreign intelligence officers and 89 foreign agents. Comparing the number of exposed spies historically, the then-FSB Director Nikolay Kovalyov said in 1996: &quot;There has never been such a number of spies arrested by us since the time when German agents were sent in during the years of World War II.&quot; The 2011 figure is similar to what was reported in 1995–1996, when around 400 foreign intelligence agents were uncovered during the two-year period.

In a high-profile case of foreign espionage, the FSB said in February 2012 that an engineer working at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia&#x27;s main space center for military launches, had been sentenced to 13 years in prison on charges of state treason. A court judged that the engineer had sold information about the testing of new Russian strategic missile systems to the American CIA.

A number of scientists have been accused of espionage and illegal technology exports by the FSB since it was established; instances include researcher Igor Sutyagin, physicist Valentin Danilov, physical chemist Oleg Korobeinichev, academician Oskar Kaibyshev, and physicist Yury Ryzhov. Ecologist and journalist Alexander Nikitin, who worked with the Bellona Foundation, was accused of espionage. He published material exposing hazards posed by the Russian Navy&#x27;s nuclear fleet. He was acquitted in 1999 after spending several years in prison (his case was sent for re-investigation 13 times while he remained in prison). In August 2021, the FSB arrested plasma physics-expert Alexander Kuranov, chief designer of the Hypersonic Systems Research Center (NIPGS in Russian) in St. Petersburg. Kuranov is suspected of passing secret information to a foreigner about hypersonic technology; he oversaw concept design on the Ayaks/Ajax hypersonic aircraft and has run a Russia-US scientific symposium for several years.

Other instances of prosecution are the cases of investigative journalist and ecologist Grigory Pasko, Vladimir Petrenko, who described danger posed by military chemical warfare stockpiles, and Nikolay Shchur, chairman of the Snezhinskiy Ecological Fund.

Other arrested people include Viktor Orekhov, a former KGB officer who assisted Soviet dissidents, Vladimir Kazantsev, who disclosed illegal purchases of eavesdropping devices from foreign firms, and Vil Mirzayanov, who had written that Russia was working on a nerve-gas weapon.

===Counterterrorism===

In 2011, the FSB prevented 94 &quot;crimes of a terrorist nature&quot;, including eight terrorist attacks. In particular, the agency foiled a planned suicide bombing in Moscow on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The agency failed to prevent terrorists perpetrating the Domodedovo International Airport bombing. Over the years, FSB and affiliated state security organizations have killed all presidents of the separatist Chechen Republic of Ichkeria including Dzhokhar Dudaev, Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, Aslan Maskhadov, and Abdul-Khalim Saidullaev. During the Moscow theater hostage crisis and Beslan school hostage crisis, all hostage-takers were killed on the spot by FSB spetsnaz forces. Only one of the suspects, Nur-Pashi Kulayev, survived and was convicted later by the court. It is reported that more than 100 leaders of terrorist groups have been killed during 119 operations on North Caucasus during 2006. On 28 July 2006, the FSB presented a list of 17 terrorist organizations recognized by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, to newspaper, which published the list that day. The list had been available previously, but only through individual request. Commenting on the list, Yuri Sapunov, head of counterterrorism at the FSB, named three main criteria necessary for organizations to be listed.

===Foreign intelligence===
According to some unofficial sources, since 1999, the FSB has also been tasked with the intelligence-gathering on the territory of the CIS countries, wherein the SVR is legally forbidden from conducting espionage under the inter-government agreements. Such activity is in line with Article 8 of the Federal Law on the FSB.

According to the Royal United Services Institute, FSB&#x27;s Department for Operational Information &quot;is responsible for compiling data on Russia&#x27;s &#x27;near abroad, having taken over the work of KGB&#x27;s Fifth Service, which ran counterintelligence inside territories of the Soviet Union.

===Targeted killing===
In the summer of 2006, the FSB was given the legal power to engage in targeted killing of terrorism suspects overseas if ordered by the president.

===Border protection===
The Federal Border Guard Service (FPS) has been part of the FSB since 2003. Russia has of sea and land borders, of which is with Kazakhstan, and with China. One kilometer (.62 miles) of border protection costs around 1 million rubles per year.

===Export control===
The FSB is engaged in the development of Russia&#x27;s export control strategy and examines drafts of international agreements related to the transfer of dual-use and military commodities and technologies. Its primary role in the nonproliferation sphere is to collect information to prevent the illegal export of controlled nuclear technology and materials.

===Surveillance===
In September 2017, WikiLeaks released &quot;Spy Files Russia&quot;, revealing how a company called Peter-Service helped state entities gather data on Russian mobile phone users as part of an online surveillance system called the System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM) with close collaboration with the FSB. SORM-1 is for wiretapping phones. SORM-2 intercepts electronic correspondence and Internet traffic. Beginning in the summer of 2014, SORM-3 has been &quot;on guard&quot; and integrates all telecommunication services in real time.

=== Cyber Units ===
In recent years, the FSB has expanded its mission to include foreign intelligence collection and offensive cyber operations. Cyber analysts have referred to FSB hackers as Berserk Bear, Energetic Bear, Gamaredon, TeamSpy, Dragonfly, Havex, Crouching Yeti, and Koala.

The FSB reportedly has two primary centers overseeing its information security and cyber operations. The first is the 16th Center, which houses most of the FSB&#x27;s signals intelligence capabilities. The FSB also includes the 18th Center for Information Security, which oversees domestic operations and security but conducts foreign operations as well. The U.S. government indicted 18th Center FSB officers in 2017 for breaching Yahoo and millions of email accounts. In 2021, Ukrainian intelligence released information and recordings of 18th Center FSB officers based in Crimea as part of the &quot;Gamaredon&quot; hacking group.

Media reporting indicates FSB units are capable of manufacturing their own advanced malware tools and have been documented manipulating exposed malware to mimic other hacking teams and conceal their activities. Reporting indicates the FSB oversees training and research institutes, which directly support the FSB&#x27;s cyber mission.

One FSB team reportedly focuses on penetrating infrastructure and energy sector targets. Most operations linked to this team appear to be reconnaissance or clandestine surveillance. The targeting of the energy sector has raised concern within the U.S. government. The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have documented the unit&#x27;s reconnaissance and noted the possibility of inserting malware to cause future damage in an attack. The U.S. government also has linked the unit to attempts to penetrate state and local government networks in 2020.

Media reporting has documented close connections between the FSB and criminal and civilian hackers, which the FSB reportedly uses to augment and staff its cyber units. DOJ has indicted multiple Russian hackers for a variety of criminal and state-sponsored cyber activities. Many of these indictments describe the close relationship between criminal hackers and the FSB.

==Criticism==

The FSB has been criticised for corruption, human rights violations and secret police activities. Some Kremlin critics such as Alexander Litvinenko have claimed that the FSB is engaged in suppression of internal dissent; Litvinenko died in 2006 as a result of polonium poisoning. Litvinenko, along with a series of other authors such as Yury Felshtinsky, David Satter, Boris Kagarlitsky, Vladimir Pribylovsky, Mikhail Trepashkin, have claimed that the 1999 apartment bombings in Moscow and other Russian cities were a false flag attack coordinated by the FSB in order to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya and boost former FSB director and then prime minister Vladimir Putin&#x27;s popularity in the lead-up to parliamentary elections and presidential transfer of power. The FSB has been further criticized by some for failure to bring Islamist terrorism in Russia under control. In the mid-2000s, the pro-Kremlin Russian sociologist Olga Kryshtanovskaya claimed that the FSB played a dominant role in the country&#x27;s political, economic and even cultural life.

After the annexation of Crimea, the FSB may also have been responsible for the forced disappearances and torture of Crimean Tatar activists and public figures. According to the United Nations, in occupied Crimea, the FSB used torture with elements of sexual violence against pro-Ukrainian activists, forcing them to confess to crimes related to terrorism. The detainees were, allegedly, beaten, tortured with electric shocks in the genitals and threatened with rape. Some, such as Oleh Sentsov, have been detained and accused in politically motivated kangaroo courts. The FSB spied on and filmed a gathering of members of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses while they were about to undergo baptism rites, with the videos used as evidence in a trial against the defendants in 2021; Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses have been banned as a group in Russia since 2017 for &quot;extremism&quot;.

In spite of various anti-corruption actions of the Russian government, FSB operatives and officials are routinely found in the center of various fraud, racket and corruption scandals. FSB officers have been frequently accused of torture, extortion, bribery and illegal takeovers of private companies, often working together with tax inspection officers. Active and former FSB officers are also present as &quot;curators&quot; in &quot;almost every single large enterprise&quot;, both in public and private sectors. Several unnamed current and former officials described the FSB as less effective than the KGB, describing it as &quot;rife with corruption, beset by bureaucratic bloat and ultimately out of touch&quot;, in a report by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2022.&quot;

On 29 December 2016, the White House accused and sanctioned the FSB and several other Russian companies for what the US intelligence agencies said was their role in helping the Russian military intelligence service, the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) disrupt and spread disinformation during the 2016 US presidential election. In addition, the State Department also declared 35 Russian diplomats and officials persona non-grata and denied Russian government officials access to two Russian-owned installations in Maryland and New York.

An investigation by Bellingcat and &quot;The Insider&quot; implicated FSB agents in the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny in August 2020, where he became ill during a flight.

It was reported that during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, FSB officers carried out filtration activities in Mariupol, which were accompanied by searches, interrogations, forced deportations to Russia, beatings and torture.

According to an investigative report by , some of the suspicious deaths of Russian businesspeople in 2022–2023 may possibly be connected to large scale accounting fraud by Gazprom executives, who may have funneled money to a network of businesses owned by friends and family members with ties to the FSB and Russian military.

===Role in the Russian doping scandal===

Following the broadcast of a documentary film alleging systematic doping in Russia, World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president Craig Reedie authorized an Independent Commission (IC) to investigate the issues brought up by the documentary in 2015. The IC authorized a review of practices on whether there were any breaches by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency. The report found direct interference into the laboratory&#x27;s operations by the Russian State undermined the laboratory&#x27;s independence and that tests conducted by the laboratory were highly suspect. The report elaborates on the role of the FSB:

In January 2016, the head of Russia&#x27;s anti-doping laboratory Grigory Rodchenkov fled Russia and exposed the doping program, which included members of the FSB replacing tainted urine samples with older, clean ones. As a result of the scandals the International Association of Athletics Federations suspended Russia from all international athletic competitions including the 2016 Summer Olympics.

In July 2016, the first McLaren Report found that &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; the Russian Ministry of Sport, the Centre of Sports Preparation of the National Teams of Russia, the FSB, and the WADA-accredited laboratory in Moscow &quot;operated for the protection of doped Russian athletes&quot; within a &quot;state-directed failsafe system&quot; using &quot;the disappearing positive [test] methodology&quot;. In a second McLaren Report released December 2016, it was found that In the period before the Sochi Games, a &quot;clean urine bank&quot; was established at the FSB Command Centre, which was situated immediately adjacent to the Sochi Laboratory. Inside that building a dedicated room containing several large freezers was set up for the purpose of storing the clean urine samples.

===Crocus City Hall attack===
On 7 March the United States Embassy in Moscow warned that &quot;extremists have imminent plans to target large gatherings in Moscow, to include concerts&quot; That day, the US also privately warned Russian officials of the danger of an impending attack from IS–KP from intelligence gathered earlier in March, under the US intelligence community&#x27;s &quot;duty to warn&quot; requirement, specifically mentioning the Crocus City Hall venue. Ten days after the attack it was reported that Iran had also warned Russia that a major &quot;terrorist operation&quot; was being planned, based on information gathered from IS militants arrested after the 2024 Kerman bombings.

Three days before the Crocus City Hall attack, President Vladimir Putin told the board of the FSB that Western warnings of a potential attack inside Russia were &quot;provocative&quot; and &quot;resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilise our society&quot;.

On 22 March 2024, four Tajik ISIS–K gunmen launched an attack on a concert hall in Krasnogorsk, Russia, with rifles and incendiaries. The attack, claimed by ISIS–K, killed 144 and injured 551 and marked the deadliest attack on Russian soil since the Beslan school siege in 2004. Putin and the FSB suggested that Ukraine was involved in the attack, without offering evidence. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB, said that &quot;radical Islamists&quot; prepared the attack with help from Ukrainian and Western &quot;special services&quot;. Bortnikov claimed that the US warning was &quot;of a general nature&quot;.

IS-affiliated Amaq News Agency published a video filmed by one of the attackers. Ukraine denied any involvement in the attack, and described the FSB&#x27;s claims that the perpetrators of the Crocus City Hall attack tried to escape to Ukraine as &quot;very doubtful and primitive&quot; disinformation, recalling that the border is heavily guarded by soldiers and drones, mined in many areas, and constantly shelled from both sides. A short video on Telegram allegedly showed one of the suspects being tortured by FSB agents, who cut off his ear and forced him to eat it.

Navalny associate Ivan Zhdanov criticized Russian security services for their &quot;catastrophic incompetence&quot; and the FSB for being &quot;busy with everything except its direct responsibilities – killing their political opponents, spying on citizens and prosecuting people who are against the war.&quot; Another associate, Leonid Volkov, said that the FSB &quot;can&#x27;t do the only job it really should be doing: preventing a real, nightmarish terrorist attack.&quot; &quot;Novaya Gazeta Europe&quot;″s chief editor, Kirill Martynov, criticized Putin for dismissing Western intelligence warnings and focusing resources on &quot;LGBT extremists&quot; and the war with Ukraine instead of guarding against &quot;real threats&quot;.

===Ukrainian invasion of the Kursk Oblast===

In August 2024, Ukrainian forces crossed the border into Kursk Oblast during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine resulting in part of the oblast becoming under Ukrainian occupation. All legal national borders of Russia are controlled by the FSB Border Guard under the command of FSB director Alexander Bortnikov. Since most of the best Russian troops were deployed in Ukraine, most of the men guarding the border in the Kursk Oblast were young, inexperienced conscripts from the FSB Border Service and lightly equipped army infantry units (all male citizens of Russia aged 18–30 are subject to conscription for 1 year of active duty military service), who suffered heavy losses in combat with experienced Ukrainian troops. Some of the conscripts stationed on the border with Ukraine were even purportedly unarmed.

<text>The  (French, ; lit. Free University of Brussels; abbreviated ULB) is a French-speaking research university in Brussels, Belgium. It has three campuses: the &quot;Solbosch&quot; campus (in the City of Brussels and Ixelles), the &quot;Plaine&quot; campus (in Ixelles) and the &quot;Erasmus&quot; campus (in Anderlecht).

The Université libre de Bruxelles was formed in 1969 by the splitting of the Free University of Brussels, which was founded in 1834 by the lawyer and liberal politician Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen. The founder aimed to establish a university independent from state and church, where academic freedom would prevail. This is still reflected in the university&#x27;s motto , or &quot;Conquering darkness through science&quot;.

One of the leading Belgian universities open to Europe and the world, the ULB now has about 24,200 students, 33% of whom come from abroad, and an equally cosmopolitan staff.

==Name==
Brussels has two universities whose names mean &quot;Free University of Brussels&quot; in English: the French-speaking (ULB) and the Dutch-speaking (VUB). Neither uses the English translation, since it is ambiguous.

==History==
===Establishment of a university in Brussels===
The history of the is closely linked with that of Belgium itself. When the Belgian State was formed in 1830 by nine breakaway provinces from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, three state universities existed in the cities of Ghent, Leuven and Liège, but none in the new capital, Brussels. Since the government was reluctant to fund another state university, a group of leading intellectuals in the fields of arts, science, and education — amongst whom the study prefect of the Royal Athenaeum of Brussels, Auguste Baron, as well as the astronomer and mathematician Adolphe Quetelet — planned to create a private university, which was permitted under the Belgian Constitution.

In 1834, the Belgian episcopate decided to establish a Catholic university in Mechelen with the aim of regaining the influence of the Catholic Church on the academic scene in Belgium, and the government had the intent to close the university at Leuven and donate the buildings to the Catholic institution. The country&#x27;s liberals strongly opposed to this decision, and furthered their ideas for a university in Brussels as a counterbalance to the Catholic institution. At the same time, Auguste Baron had just become a member of the freemasonic lodge &quot;Les Amis Philantropes&quot;. Baron was able to convince Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen, the president of the lodge, to support the idea for a new university. On 24 June 1834, Verhaegen presented his plan to establish a free university.

After sufficient funding was collected among advocates, the &quot;Université libre de Belgique&quot; (&quot;Free University of Belgium&quot;) was inaugurated on 20 November 1834, in the Gothic Room of Brussels Town Hall. The date of its establishment is still commemorated annually, by students of its successor institutions, as a holiday called Saint Verhaegen (often shortened to &quot;St V&quot;) for Pierre-Théodore Verhaegen. In 1836, the university was renamed the &quot;Université libre de Bruxelles&quot; (&quot;Free University of Brussels&quot;).

After its establishment, the Free University faced difficult times, since it received no subsidies or grants from the government; yearly fundraising events and tuition fees provided the only financial means. Verhaegen, who became a professor and later head of the new university, gave it a mission statement which he summarised in a speech to King Leopold I: &quot;the principle of &quot;free inquiry&quot; and academic freedom uninfluenced by any political or religious authority.&quot; In 1858, the Catholic Church established the Saint-Louis Institute in the city, which subsequently expanded into a university in its own right.

===Growth, internal tensions and move===
The Free University grew significantly over the following decades. In 1842, it moved to the Granvelle Palace, which it occupied until 1928. It expanded the number of subjects taught and, in 1880, became one of the first institutions in Belgium to allow female students to study in some faculties. In 1893, it received large grants from Ernest and Alfred Solvay and Raoul Warocqué to open new faculties in the city. A disagreement over an invite to the anarchist geographer Élisée Reclus to speak at the university in 1893 led to some of the liberal and socialist faculty splitting away from the Free University to form the New University of Brussels (&quot;Université nouvelle de Bruxelles&quot;) in 1894. The institution failed to displace the Free University, however, and closed definitively in 1919.

In 1900, the Free University&#x27;s football team won the bronze medal at the Summer Olympics. After Racing Club de Bruxelles declined to participate, a student selection with players from the university was sent by the Federation. The team was enforced with a few non-students. The Institute of Sociology was founded in 1902, then in 1904 the Solvay School of Commerce, which would later become the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management. In 1911, the university obtained its legal personality under the name &quot;Université libre de Bruxelles - Vrije Hogeschool te Brussel&quot;.

The German occupation during World War I led to the suspension of classes for four years in 1914–1918. In the aftermath of the war, the Free University moved its principle activities to the &quot;Solbosch&quot; in the southern suburb of Ixelles and a purpose-built university campus was created, funded by the Belgian American Educational Foundation.

The university was again closed by the German occupiers during World War II on 25 November 1941. Students from the university were involved in the Belgian Resistance, notably establishing the sabotage-orientated network Groupe G.

===Splitting of the university===
Courses at the Free University were taught exclusively in French until the early 20th century. After Belgian independence, French was widely accepted as the language of the bourgeoisie and upper classes and was the only medium in law and academia. As the Flemish Movement gained prominence among the Dutch-speaking majority in Flanders over the late 19th century, the lack of provision for Dutch speakers in higher education became a major source of political contention. Ghent University became the first institution in 1930 to teach exclusively in Dutch.

Some courses at the Free University&#x27;s Faculty of Law began being taught in both French and Dutch as early as 1935. Nevertheless, it was not until 1963 that all faculties offered their courses in both languages. Tensions between French- and Dutch-speaking students in the country came to a head in 1968 when the Catholic University of Leuven split along linguistic lines, becoming the first of several national institutions to do so.

On 1 October 1969, the French and Dutch entities of the Free University separated into two distinct sister universities. This splitting became official with the act of 28 May 1970, of the Belgian Parliament, by which the French-speaking (ULB) and the Dutch-speaking (VUB) officially became two separate legal, administrative and scientific entities.

==Campuses==
The ULB comprises three main campuses: the &quot;Solbosch&quot; campus, on the territories of the City of Brussels and Ixelles municipalities in the Brussels-Capital Region, the &quot;Plaine&quot; campus in Ixelles, and the &quot;Erasmus&quot; campus in Anderlecht, beside the Erasmus Hospital.

The main and largest campus of the university is the &quot;Solbosch&quot;, which hosts the administration and general services of the university. It also includes most of the faculties of the humanities, the &quot;École polytechnique&quot;, the large library of social sciences, and among the museums of the ULB, the Museum of Zoology and Anthropology, the &quot;Allende&quot; exhibition room and the Michel de Ghelderode Museum-Library.

The &quot;Plaine&quot; campus hosts the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Pharmacy. There are also the Experimentariums of physics and chemistry, the Museum of Medicinal Plants and Pharmacy and student housing. This site is served by Delta station.

The &quot;Erasmus&quot; campus houses the Erasmus Hospital and the &quot;Pôle Santé&quot;, the Faculty of Medicine, the School of Public Health and the Faculty of Motor Sciences. There is also the School of Nursing (with the Haute école libre de Bruxelles – Ilya Prigogine), the Museum of Medicine and the Museum of Human Anatomy and Embryology. This site is served by Erasme/Erasmus metro station.

The university also has buildings and activities in the Brussels municipality of Auderghem, and outside of Brussels, in Charleroi on the Aéropole Science Park and Nivelles.

==Research==
At the heart of the Free University of Brussels there are at least 2000 PhD students and around 3600 researchers and lecturers who work around different scientific fields and produce cutting-edge research.

The projects of these scientists span thematics that concern exact, applied and human sciences and researchers at the heart of the ULB have been awarded numerous international awards and recognitions.

The research carried out at the ULB is financed by different bodies such as the European Research Council, the Walloon Region, the Brussels Capital Region, the National Fund for Scientific Research, or one of the foundations that are dedicated to research at the ULB; the ULB Foundation or the Erasme Funds. 

Since the early 2000s, the &quot;MAPP&quot; project has started studying political party membership evolution through the time.

<text>Northeastern University (NU or NEU) is a private research university with its main campus in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. Established in 1898, it was founded by the Boston Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association as an all-male institute before being incorporated as Northeastern College in 1916, gaining university status in 1922. With more than 38,000 students, Northeastern is the largest university in Massachusetts by enrollment.

Northeastern is a large, highly residential university which is composed of ten colleges, including the Northeastern University School of Law. The university&#x27;s main campus in Boston is located within the center of the city along Huntington Avenue and Columbus Avenue near the Fenway–Kenmore and Roxbury neighborhoods. It offers undergraduate and graduate programs, and most undergraduates participate in a cooperative education program. Northeastern is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education and is a member of the Boston Consortium for Higher Education. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

Northeastern maintains satellite campuses in Charlotte, North Carolina; Seattle, Washington; San Jose, California; Oakland, California; Portland, Maine; Burlington, Massachusetts; Miami, Florida; London; and Toronto and Vancouver in Canada. In 2019, it purchased the New College of the Humanities, establishing an additional campus in London, England. The university&#x27;s sports teams, the Northeastern Huskies, compete in NCAA Division I as members of the Coastal Athletic Association (CAA) in 18 varsity sports. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey teams compete in Hockey East, while the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rowing teams compete in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC) and Eastern Association of Women&#x27;s Rowing Colleges (EAWRC), respectively.

==History==

=== Early development ===

In May 1896, directors of the Boston Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association, the first in the U.S., established an Evening Institute for Younger Men, to merge, coordinate and improve its classes that had evolved over the past 40 years. Included among roughly 30 courses offered were algebra, bookkeeping, literature, French, German, Latin, geography, electricity, music, penmanship and physiology. In addition, a banjo club, camera club, orchestra, and weekly parliamentary debates and discussions were promoted. A good education for &quot;any young man of moral character&quot; with a YMCA membership was promised. Located in a new headquarters building at the corner of Boylston and Berkeley streets in Boston, the institute held its first classes in 1898. After a fire, a new YMCA building was constructed on Huntington Avenue in 1913.

The School of Law was also formally established in 1898 with the assistance of an advisory committee, consisting of James Barr Ames, dean of the Harvard Law School; Samuel Bennett, dean of the Boston University School of Law; and Judge James R. Dunbar. In 1903, the first Automobile Engineering School in the country was established, followed by a Polytechnic School in 1904 and a School of Commerce and Finance in 1907. Day classes began in 1909. In 1916, a bill was introduced into the Massachusetts Legislature to incorporate the institute as Northeastern College. After considerable debate and investigation, it was passed in March 1916.

In 1909, the Polytechnic School began offering co-operative engineering courses to eight students. A four-year daytime program had been established consisting of alternating single weeks of classroom instruction and practical work experience with mostly railroad companies that agreed to accept student workers. In 1920, the Co-operative School of Engineering, which later became the College of Engineering, was first authorized to grant degrees in civil, chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. The cooperative program, the second of its kind in the U.S. after one in Cincinnati, Ohio, was eventually adopted by all departments.

On March 30, 1917, veteran educator Frank Palmer Speare, who had served as director of the institute, was inaugurated as the first president of the newly incorporated Northeastern College. Five years later the college changed its name to Northeastern University to better reflect the increasing depth of its instruction. In March 1923, the university secured general (A.B. and B.S.) degree-granting power from the Legislature, with the exception of the medical and dental degrees.

The College of Liberal Arts was added in 1935. Two years later the Northeastern University Corporation was established, with a board of trustees composed of 31 university members and 8 from the YMCA. Following World War II, Northeastern began admitting women. In 1948, Northeastern separated itself completely from the YMCA. By 1959, when Carl Ell who had expanded the university stepped down as president, Northeastern had a local identity as an independent technical university serving a commuter and adult population.

That reputation began changing during the presidency of Asa S. Knowles, from 1959 to 1975. Facing a postwar educational boom, the university broadened undergraduate offerings, increased graduate offerings, modernized administrative and faculty structures, created a Faculty Senate, launched its first-ever capital campaign, reorganized and expanded adult and continuing education, and increased the number of colleges. The university created the College of Education (1953), University College (1960), now called the College of Professional Studies, and the colleges of Pharmacy and Nursing (1964), which both later merged into the Bouvé College of Health Sciences. The creation of the College of Criminal Justice (1967) followed, and then the Khoury College of Computer Sciences (1982), the first college in the United States dedicated to the field of computer science.

Between 1959 and 1975, Northeastern&#x27;s student population not only grew considerably larger, but also more diverse. At the beginning of this period, most of the student body was composed of white males from New England, the majority of whom came from the Boston-area public schools and primarily studied business or engineering. By 1974–75, women accounted for 33 percent of the nearly 14,000 undergraduates students, while 5 percent were black. Over 900 students came from different foreign countries. Of the graduating class of 2,238, 513 were in Liberal Arts, 462 in Engineering, 389 in Business, 227 in Pharmacy and Allied Health, and the remainder were roughly divided among Education, Boston-Bouvé, Nursing and Criminal Justice.

To attract more women, the university refurbished existing facilities, constructed new women&#x27;s dormitories and encouraged their participation in all programs. The merger with Boston-Bouvé, a women&#x27;s college dedicated to physical health, and the creation of the College of Nursing, traditionally a female profession, also contributed to the increase. Though there was an explicit nondiscrimination policy on the books, throughout its history Northeastern had only a handful of black students. In the early 1960s, with financial assistance from the Ford Foundation in New York in the form of scholarships and co-ops to black high school students, Northeastern began actively recruiting black students. By 1975, black student-led organizations included the Afro-photo Society, Student Grill, Health Careers Club, The Onyx (a black student newspaper), Muhindi Literary Guild, the Outing Club, Black Engineering Society, and the first recognized black fraternity at the university, the Omicron chapter of Iota Phi Theta. In addition, the number of foreign students increased from 170 in the 1950s and 1960s to 960 by 1974–75.

=== Recent history ===
By the early 1980s, under President Kenneth G. Ryder, the one-time night commuter school had grown into one of the largest private universities in the nation at around 55,000 students. In 1990, the first class with more live-on campus rather than commuter students was graduated. After Ryder&#x27;s retirement in 1989, the university adopted a slow and more thoughtful approach to change. Following an economic downturn, a 1991 trustee committee report described the situation as &quot;life threatening to Northeastern,&quot; warning of a $17 million budget gap with no funding mechanisms to cover it. That year President John A. Curry formulated a new strategy of transforming Northeastern into a &quot;smaller, leaner, better place to work and study,&quot; describing unacceptable compromises in the quality and reputation of the university that had been made in the quest for more students. Staff were terminated and admissions targets were reduced, with applicant numbers beginning to rise and attrition rates fall by the end of Curry&#x27;s tenure.
When Curry left office in 1996, the university population had been systematically reduced to about 25,000. Incoming President Richard M. Freeland decided to focus on recruiting the type of students who were already graduating as the school&#x27;s prime demographic. Freeland focused on improving academics and restructuring the administration with a goal of &quot;creating the country&#x27;s premier program of practice oriented education&quot;. In the early 1990s, the university began a $485 million construction program that included residence halls, academic and research facilities, and athletic centers. During the university&#x27;s transition, Freeland reorganized the co-operative education system, decentralizing it into a department-based system to allow better integration of classroom learning with workplace experience. Full-time degree programs shifted from a four-quarter system to two traditional semesters and two summer &quot;minimesters,&quot; allowing students to both delve more deeply into their academic courses and have longer and more substantive co-op placements, forcing departments to redesign aging programs to fit the longer format. Freeland also created a marketing department, uncommon for universities at the time, and expanded the university advancement office, while setting an ambitious $200 million fundraising target with the goal of reducing dependency on tuition.

Between 1995 and 2007, average SAT exam scores increased more than 200 points, retention rates rose dramatically, and applications doubled. In 1998, Freeland set an admissions target of 2,800 freshman per year, allowing for adequate tuition income without compromising on education. Throughout the transformation, his oft-repeated goal was to crack the top 100 of the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s&quot; rankings of America&#x27;s best universities. With this accomplished by 2005, the transformation goal from commuting school to nationally recognized research university was complete. Freeland stepped down on August 15, 2006, and was followed by President Joseph E. Aoun, a former dean at the University of Southern California.

As part of a five-year, $75 million Academic Investment Plan that ran from 2004 to 2009, the university concentrated on undergraduate education, core graduate professional programs, and centers of research excellence. Faculty was originally to be bolstered by 100 new tenured and tenure-track professors, later expanded to include 300 additional tenure and tenure-track faculty in interdisciplinary fields. Aoun also placed more emphasis on improving community relations by reaching out to leaders of the neighborhoods surrounding the university. In addition, Aoun created more academic partnerships with other institutions in the Boston area, including Tufts University, Hebrew College and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts.

During this period, Northeastern rapidly advanced in national rankings. It placed 42nd in the 2014–15 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;&#x27;s best colleges and universities rankings, a 7 position jump from 2013 to 2014 and a 27 place gain since 2010–11. Critics have argued that Northeastern&#x27;s rise in the rankings shows that the university has &quot;cracked the code&quot; to academic rankings, while others suggested it figured out how to &quot;game the system.&quot; The positive feedback effect of its placement, in turn, allowed the institution to significantly increase its endowment, admit a more-competitive student body, hire new faculty, add to its campuses and expand its flagship co-op program.

The Empower Campaign was launched in May 2013 for student support, faculty advancement/expansion, innovation in education and research. Its goal was to raise $1 billion by 2017, with half of that being from philanthropic support and the other half from industry and government partnerships. The goal was raised to $1.25 billion in 2015. The campaign was inspired by Richard D&#x27;Amore and Alan McKim&#x27;s $60 million donation to the university&#x27;s business school in 2012. In October 2017, Northeastern revealed that the final total of the Empower campaign was $1.4 billion. More than 100,000 individuals and over 3,800 organizations donated to Empower, from 110 countries.

In 2021, the Hillel at Northeastern University, which serves as the school&#x27;s Jewish student center, experienced an incident of antisemitic vandalism: a sacred ornament known as a mezuzah was torn down from the building&#x27;s rear entrance. The mezuzah was torn down following the invitation by Hillel of reformed neo-Nazi TM Garret, a human rights advocate who has dedicated his work to anti-racism and anti-violence programs. The Hillel at Northeastern University felt Garret was &quot;an ally of the Jewish people&quot;. University president Joseph Aoun condemned the act in an email sent to the school community. A security camera video was taken of the individual performing the vandalism, but no suspect was ever caught.

Northeastern University&#x27;s Experiential Technologies lab contains, among others, virtual reality equipment. On September 12, 2022, police responded to an incident at the lab, claiming that a pressurized case, accompanied by a note that critiqued the school and its relationship with VR developers, had exploded. The explosion injured Jason Duhaime, a 45-year-old university employee. Police became skeptical after finding several inconsistencies in Duhaime&#x27;s testimony, such as a lack of physical evidence of an explosion. Additionally, it was discovered that the note attached to the explosive device was composed on Duhaime&#x27;s computer only a day earlier. Although a second device of similar construction was found elsewhere on campus, the threat was neutralized; Northeastern resumed normal academic activities the next day. The following month, federal prosecutors determined that Jason Duhaime, the Northeastern employee who claimed to be the sole witness of the explosion and was seemingly injured by it, had concocted the event as a hoax. Duhaime was subsequently charged with a fine of $250,000 and a five year in prison sentence. He was also fired from his position within the university.

In May 2024 it was announced that Marymount Manhattan College would merge with Northeastern University, which was to be renamed Northeastern University-New York City. The merger would not be finalized until it received regulatory approval, which could take up to two years.

Northeastern University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

===Colleges and schools===
Northeastern University has eight degree-granting colleges:

* College of Arts, Media and Design
* Khoury College of Computer Sciences
* College of Engineering
* Bouvé College of Health Sciences
* College of Professional Studies
* College of Science
* College of Social Sciences and Humanities
* Mills College at Northeastern University (since 2023)

These colleges house schools and departments. There are also two separate schools, not housed within the other colleges: 
* D&#x27;Amore-McKim School of Business
* Northeastern University School of Law

===Honors Program===
The University Honors Program selects students from the regular applicant pool with no separate application and represent the applicants with the highest GPA and SAT/ACT scores that year. The program includes specialty work in a major field through college-specific choices including specialized advanced honors seminars and an independent research project. Students in the Honors Program exclusively can live in a Living-Learning Community housed in West Villages C and F. 2017 also marked the beginning of the Honors Discovery course and the introduction of the Student Assessed Integrated Learning (SAIL) app.

===Co-op/internship program===
Launched in 1909, Northeastern has one of the largest and oldest cooperative education (co-op) programs in the world. In the co-op program, students alternate periods of academic study with periods of professional employment (usually paid) related to their major. Students can choose to complete one or two co-op experiences to graduate in four years, or they can choose to complete three co-ops to graduate in five years. Students on co-op do not pay tuition and students not living on campus do not pay room and board. The co-op program typically begins the spring of the second year or fall of the third year (after a more traditional program for the first semesters on campus). Students usually take anywhere between one and three with 96% participating in one and 78% participating in two or more.

50% of Northeastern students receive a job offer from a previous co-op employer .

===Study abroad===
Northeastern has semester-long study abroad programs with placements in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America. Some participating schools include: University of Cambridge and London School of Economics, England; University of Edinburgh, Scotland; Reims Management School, France; European School of Business, Germany; University of Cape Town, South Africa; University of Auckland, New Zealand; Swinburne University of Technology, Australia; University of Tokyo, Japan; American College of Thessaloniki, Greece and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Chile and also Antarctica.

Northeastern&#x27;s International Business program is a member of the International Partnership of Business Schools. Through this program International Business students have the opportunity to be awarded a dual-degree from Northeastern as well as from a sister school abroad.

===Research===
The university provides undergraduate students with an opportunity to engage in research through the Center for Experiential Education, CenSSIS Research Experience for Undergraduates, Honors Research, Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program, and Provost&#x27;s Office research grants. In FY 2007, annual external research funding exceeded $78 million. In FY 2009–10, the research funding is close to $82 million. In 2002, Northeastern&#x27;s Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems was designated an NSF Engineering Research Center. In 2004, Northeastern was one of six institutions selected by the National Science Foundation as a center for research in nanotechnology. In 2010, Northeastern was granted $12 million by an alum for a Homeland security research facility, to be named the George J. Kostas Research Institute for Homeland Security, after its chief benefactor.

==Undergraduate admissions==

For undergraduate students, Northeastern&#x27;s 2023 acceptance rate was 5.6%. Of the record-large pool of 96,327 applicants, only ~5,389 were admitted. The sharp rise in applications and drop in admission is attributed to an over enrollment issue that the admission office attempted to fix. 2020 acceptance rate was 18.1%. For the Class of 2024, Northeastern received 64,459 applications, with 13,199 students accepted. In 2018, the record number of applications led to a drop in acceptance rate, eight percentage points lower than the previous year. Additionally, Northeastern was one of the top ten most applied to colleges in 2018.

For the Class of 2022 (enrolling fall 2018), Northeastern received 62,272 applications, accepted 12,042 (19%), and enrolled 2,746. For the freshmen who enrolled, the middle 50% range of SAT scores was 670–750 for reading and writing, 690–790 for math, while the middle 50% range ACT composite range was 32–34.

Of those who applied in 2016, 9,500 were international students, up from 1,128 international applicants in 2006. Of those who enrolled, 20% were international students. In the Power of International Education&#x27;s 2017 Open Doors report, Northeastern was ranked as the fourth-highest institution in the United States to host international students.

The number of international students totals over 12,000 representing 138 different nations and over half of the student body. The number of international students at Northeastern has steadily increased by about 1,000 students every year since 2008.

==Rankings==
In the 2024 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings, Northeastern was tied for 53rd in the National Universities category. The 2021 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Northeastern 49th in its annual ranking of national universities. In 2014, &quot;College Prowler&quot; gave Northeastern an &quot;A+&quot; rating for the quality of classes, professors, and overall academic environment. A 2008 Reader&#x27;s Digest survey ranked NU as the second safest school in the United States after Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.

== Campus ==
Northeastern University&#x27;s main campus is located on mostly along Huntington Avenue and Columbus Avenue in an area known as the Fenway Cultural District, part of Boston&#x27;s Fenway and Roxbury neighborhood, near the Museum of Fine Arts, Symphony Hall, New England Conservatory, and Christian Science Center.

In 2019, the campus was officially designated as an arboretum by ArbNet, making it the only campus in Boston to receive the designation.

The first baseball World Series took place on the Huntington Avenue Grounds, now part of the campus. The site is commemorated in front of Churchill Hall by a statue of Cy Young.

In 2014, Northeastern officially launched a Public Art Initiative to place a series of murals and other art around the Boston campus. Among those whose work has been commissioned are French artist Jef Aérosol, Houston-born artist Daniel Anguilu, Los Angeles-based El Mac and Charleston, South Carolina-born artist Shepard Fairey, known for his 2008 Barack Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster.

===Campus development===

During the Great Depression in the 1930s, as enrollment grew to over 4,600 students, President Frank Palmer Speare announced that Northeastern would build a new campus. Coolidge Shepley Bulfinch and Abbott, a Boston-based architectural firm, was selected to design the campus near the Huntington Avenue YMCA building that continued to house library and classroom spaces. Richards Hall, which housed classrooms, laboratories and administrative offices, was the first building completed in October 1938. Its light gray, glazed brick exterior with vertical strips of windows was replicated in other buildings of what later became known as the 1944 master plan. A mix of Beaux-Arts and Bauhaus architectural styles defined by stripped-down classicism and open courtyards that resembled that of Massachusetts Institute of Technology across the Charles River. In a June 14, 1934 article, the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot; described the campus design as &quot;modernistic classical.&quot;

In 1961, under President Asa Knowles, the university purchased a 7-acre red brick industrial complex once owned by the United Drug Company to build athletic facilities. Three of the buildings facing Forsyth Street were demolished, but due to a need for more office and lab space, the remaining buildings were divided into four sections now called Lake Hall, Holmes Hall, Nightingale Hall and Meserve Hall.

During the last few years, major developments include Northeastern becoming recognized as an arboretum, opening a $225 million research and laboratory complex known as the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex (ISEC), launching the Institute for Experiential Artificial Intelligence with a $50 million donation, as well as renaming the College of Computer and Information Science to the Khoury College of Computer Sciences with another $50 million donation from Amin Khoury.

EXP, another large research facility created to support Northeastern&#x27;s work in autonomous vehicles, drones, and humanoid robots recently opened for the 2023–2024 school year. This building is approximately , including a 15,000 square foot makers space for students of all colleges and degree levels.

In early 2024, Northeastern University installed Cicely Carew&#x27;s art piece, &quot;Rooted.&quot; Massive student pushback surfaced, including a student-founded petition that gained almost two-thousand signatures, citing that the installation obscured the iconic Krentzman Quadrangle. In particular, students in the Northeastern University Class of 2024 expressed that &quot;Rooted&quot; obscured their graduation photos and were likened to &quot;loofah trees&quot; or from the Lorax movie. In response, the Northeastern University Student Government Association, passed legislation in October 2024 to have it removed or relocated to another area of campus.

===Sustainability===

The 2011 Sustainable Endowments Institute&#x27;s College Sustainability Report Card issued Northeastern a grade of &quot;A−&quot; for its environmental sustainability efforts and programs. Additionally, the Princeton Review rated Northeastern as one of the top 15 &quot;Green Colleges&quot; in the nation in 2010. In 2011, the GreenMetric World University ranking evaluated Northeastern as the second greenest university in the world, and first in the US. Northeastern placed first in the rankings again in 2014.

In accordance with a Boston zoning code amendment in 2007, International Village residence hall was certified as a LEED Gold building in 2010. Dockser Hall was the first building on campus to achieve LEED certification, also Gold, with the completion of its renovation in 2010. East Village was rated LEED Silver in 2016 and the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex was rated LEED Gold in 2018. The university affiliated LightView apartment building is targeting a LEED Platinum certification, the first in student housing in the City of Boston.

In 2004, Northeastern was awarded the gold medal by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society for its Dedham Campus.

===Public transportation===
The MBTA subway Orange Line and Green Line E branch pass through the Northeastern campus. Five stations serve the campus: and on the Orange Line; and , , and on the Green Line. The Green Line is paralleled by MBTA bus route . Ruggles station is also served by the Needham, Providence/Stoughton, and Franklin/Foxboro Lines of the MBTA Commuter Rail system and is a major transfer point for MBTA bus routes.

===Landmarks===

====Centers and commons====
Facing Huntington Avenue, Krentzman Quadrangle is the main quadrangle on the campus of Northeastern. It is recognizable by the &quot;Northeastern University&quot; brick sign in front. The quad lies at the heart of the original campus between Ell, Dodge and Richards halls, and serves as a gathering space for community members and outdoor activities. It was named after Harvey Krentzman, a businessman and 1949 alumnus.

Centennial Common is a lawn created to mark the 100th anniversary of Northeastern University in 1998. The grassy area borders Shillman Hall, Ryder Hall, Meserve Hall, Leon Street, Forsyth Street and Ruggles Station, and serves as a gateway to the West Campus. The area is a popular gathering spot frequently used by students for recreational purposes and outdoor activities by student organizations.

The Marino Recreation Center, named after 1961 alumnus Roger Marino, co-founder of EMC Corporation, is an indoor fitness center that opened in the Fall of 1996.

====Halls and auditoriums====

Ell Hall, completed in 1947, is one of the oldest buildings on campus and is centered on Krentzman Quadrangle. It contains administrative offices, classrooms, art display space, a 992-seat auditorium and the Northeastern Bookstore. Like Dodge Hall, Ell Hall has five floors and also connects to the tunnel network. The tunnels interconnect the major administrative and traditional academic buildings for use in inclement weather. Ell Hall was named for Carl Ell, president of Northeastern from 1940 to 1959, who is credited with expanding the campus and making cooperative education an integral part of the university-wide curriculum.

Blackman Auditorium, Northeastern&#x27;s largest event space, hosts many different types of events for classes, theater groups, dance teams, musical groups, choral groups, fraternities, sororities, and orchestral ensembles. Blackman has hosted many talented individuals from Maya Angelou to Seth Meyers.

Gallery 360 is Northeastern University&#x27;s art gallery, which is free and open to the public throughout the year. The space houses temporary exhibits of artworks by visiting artists, students, faculty, and the surrounding community. Some larger exhibits also include the adjacent hallways for additional space. Curation and administration is under the supervision of the College of Arts Media and Design (CAMD).Dodge Hall sits on Krentzman Quadrangle and primarily serves as the home of Northeastern&#x27;s D&#x27;Amore-McKim School of Business. The building was completed in 1952 and named for Robert Gray Dodge, a former chairman of Northeastern&#x27;s board of trustees. It has five floors. From 1953 until Snell Library opened in 1990, Dodge Hall&#x27;s basement served as the university&#x27;s main library.

Originally known as West Building, Richards Hall borders Krentzman Quadrangle and was the first building constructed on campus in October 1938. Its light gray brick and vertical window strips design was the work of alumnus Herman Voss and was replicated in other surrounding buildings. Richards Hall was named for Boston industrialist James Lorin Richards, a former board trustee.

====Interdisciplinary Science &amp; Engineering Complex====
On February 21, 2014, Northeastern had its groundbreaking ceremony for the new Interdisciplinary Science &amp; Engineering Complex (ISEC) on Columbus Avenue. Completed in 2017, the building provides research and educational space for students and faculty from the College of Science, Bouvé College of Health Sciences, College of Engineering, and Khoury College of Computer Sciences. The centerpiece of the complex includes a large atrium, a spiral staircase, and a 280-seat auditorium.

====Matthews Arena====
Opened in 1910 and originally known as the Boston Arena, Matthews Arena is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving indoor ice hockey arena. Located on the eastern edge of Northeastern University&#x27;s campus, it is home to the Northeastern Huskies men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey teams, and men&#x27;s basketball team as well as the Wentworth Institute of Technology&#x27;s men&#x27;s hockey team. The arena is named after former university Board of Trustees Chairman George J. Matthews, a 1956 graduate, and his wife, the late Hope M. Matthews, who helped fund a major renovation in 1982. The arena is the original home of the NHL Boston Bruins and the WHA New England Whalers (now the NHL Carolina Hurricanes). It was also the secondary home to the NBA Boston Celtics in the 1940s. It has hosted all or part of the America East Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament a total of seven times and hosted the 1960 Frozen Four. The arena also served as the original home to the annual Beanpot tournament between Boston&#x27;s four major college hockey programs.

====Dorms and housing====
East Village is Northeastern&#x27;s newest dorm building and only houses freshmen and upperclassmen who are in the University Honors Program. The building is located at 291 St. Botolph Street and opened in January 2015. Honors freshman live in its suite-style rooms whereas upperclassmen can choose full apartments with kitchen facilities. The building also contains 5 classrooms in the basement and an event space on the 17th Floor.

There are current plans to build a new 23 story dorm that has been approved and would provide housing for an additional 1,300 students.In 2008, West Village Building F was recognized in American Institute of Architects New England 2008 Merit Awards for Design Excellence.

====South Campus (Columbus Avenue)====
Northeastern&#x27;s southernmost section of campus is located along Columbus Avenue in Roxbury, parallel to the Orange line. The university expanded south into Roxbury at the same time as they were building West Village. In 2001, Davenport Commons was opened, providing 585 students housing in two residence halls while 75 families representing a range of incomes have been able to purchase a condo or townhouse at or below Boston&#x27;s market value. Davenport Commons also created commercial space on Tremont Street.

During the summer of 2006, Northeastern proposed a new residence hall further away from the main campus, at the corner of Tremont Street and Ruggles Street. Construction began in late February 2007. In the spring of 2009, the complex was named International Village and opened later that summer. It consists of three interconnected residential towers, an office tower, administration building, and a gym. A 400-seat dining hall is available to all members of the Northeastern community as well as the public.

Lightview was launched in 2019, which was Boston&#x27;s first developer-led, equity-financed student housing project built and financed by American Campus Communities exclusively for Northeastern students. The building is 20 stories tall and includes a fitness area as well as social and recreational spaces.

====Library facilities====
Northeastern University Libraries include the Snell Library and the John D. O&#x27;Bryant African-American Institute Library. The NU School of Law Library is separately administered by the NU School of Law. The NU Libraries received federal depository designation in 1963.

The Snell Library opened in 1990 at a cost of $35 million. It is also home to the Northeastern University Archives and Special Collections department, which includes the Benjamin LaGuer papers collection. The Special Collections focus on records of Boston-area community-based organizations that are concerned with social justice issues. In June 2016, the library staff adopted an open-access policy to make its members&#x27; professional research publicly accessible online.

==Network campuses==
In addition to Northeastern&#x27;s main Boston campus, the university operates a number of satellite locations in Massachusetts, including the George J. Kostas Research Institute in Burlington, a Financial District campus in the Hilton Hotel near Faneuil Hall in downtown Boston, a Dedham Campus in Dedham, and a Marine Science Center in Nahant. The Kostas Research Institute for Homeland Security, which opened in 2011, contains the Laboratory for Structural Testing of Resilient and Sustainable Systems (STReSS Laboratory). The laboratory is &quot;equipped to test full-scale and large-scale structural systems and materials to failure so as to explore the development of new strategies for designing, simulating, and sensing structural and infrastructure systems&quot;.The university has also launched a number of full-service remote network campuses in North America, including in Charlotte, North Carolina, in October 2011, Seattle, in January 2013, San Jose, California, in March 2015, Toronto, in 2016 and Vancouver, British Columbia in 2019. In January 2020, Northeastern announced that it was opening the Roux Institute in Portland, Maine, a new research institute focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning in digital and life sciences. The decision came after Northeastern was selected for a $100 million donation by David Roux, in hopes of turning the city into a new tech hub and in an attempt to spark economic growth in the region.

More recently, the university has continued to focus on global expansion. In late 2018, Northeastern announced the acquisition of the New College of the Humanities, a small private London-based college founded by the philosopher A. C. Grayling. The move was seen as unorthodox as most U.S. colleges have typically chosen to build new campus branches abroad, rather than purchasing existing ones.

On July 1, 2022, Mills College in Oakland, California was renamed to Mills College at Northeastern University through a merger between the university and the liberal arts college, which had financial troubles.

On May 29, 2024, Northeastern and Marymount Manhattan College in New York City announced a merger that will create Northeastern University – New York City.

==Student organizations==
Northeastern has more than 16 varsity teams competing in the NCAA, over 30 club sports teams and over 400 student clubs and organizations. Among the student-run organizations are: Resident Student Association (RSA), Student Government Association (SGA), &quot;The Huntington News&quot;, Northeastern Television (NUTV), Northeastern Shakespeare Society (NSS), Fraternity and Sorority Life (FSL), Social Justice Resource Center (SJRC), and the Council for University Programs (CUP) organize activities for Northeastern students as well as the surrounding community.

Northeastern hosts six student-run a cappella groups on campus: three mixed ensembles (Distilled Harmony, The Downbeats, and The Nor&#x27;easters), two treble ensembles (Pitch, Please! and Treble on Huntington), and one TTBB ensemble (UniSons). All groups regularly compete in the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA). The Nor&#x27;easters have performed at ICCA finals in New York City three times and won the ICCA title in 2013 and 2017. Pitch, Please! competed at ICCA finals in 2019.

===Athletics===

Since 1927, Northeastern University&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams have been known as the &quot;Huskies&quot;. Prior to 1927, Northeastern had no official mascot. A committee was formed to choose a mascot and members eventually settled on the Siberian Husky. In February 1927, a pup was selected from legendary Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race competitor Leonhard Seppala&#x27;s kennel in Poland Springs, Maine. On March 4, 1927, King Husky I arrived at Northeastern in a campus celebration for which classes were canceled. Since then, live mascots have been a Siberian Husky breed, but after losing two mascots in three months in the early 1970s and after upheaval due to having live canine mascots, the university&#x27;s administration was reluctant to continue the live mascot tradition. In 2005, the university resumed the live mascot tradition; the current live mascot is named Moses. The university&#x27;s official costumed mascot is Paws.

The university&#x27;s official colors are Northeastern red and black, with white often used as an alternate color. The university fight song, &quot;All Hail, Northeastern,&quot; was composed by Charles A. Pethybridge, class of 1932. Since 2005, 14 of 18 Northeastern varsity sports teams primarily compete in NCAA Division I&#x27;s Colonial Athletic Association (CAA).

During its first decades, Northeastern initially had seven athletics teams: basketball, cross country, indoor track, outdoor track, crew and football.

Northeastern sponsors the following sports teams:
* (M) Baseball
* (M), (W) Basketball
* (M), (W) Cross country
* (W) Field hockey
* (M), (W) Ice hockey (in Hockey East)
* (M), (W) Rowing (in Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges and Eastern Association of Women&#x27;s Rowing Colleges)
* (M), (W) Soccer
* (W) Swimming and diving
* (M), (W) Track and field
* (W) Volleyball
The baseball, soccer, lacrosse and rugby teams compete at Parsons Field, a multipurpose facility located in Brookline, a mile and a half from the campus. The field&#x27;s baseball diamond was named Friedman Diamond in 1988. The field hockey team, along with the Huskies&#x27; track and field teams, compete at a sports complex about away from campus in Dedham. Matthews Arena, which opened 1910, is home to the hockey and basketball programs. The 4,666-seat arena is located close to campus, just off Massachusetts Avenue. It is considered the world&#x27;s oldest multi-purpose athletic building. Henderson Boathouse is home to the Huskies&#x27; men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s rowing squads. The Henderson Boathouse is located on the Charles River near Soldiers Field Road in Allston. The university also maintains the Cabot Physical Education Center, which opened in 1954 and includes a basketball court; an indoor track and natatorium; the Gries Center for Sports Medicine and Performance Center; a squash facility; and the William E. Carter Playground, a renovated community park on Columbus Avenue.

The baseball team was founded in 1921 and has since competed in one College World Series and played in the NCAA regionals seven times. In the 2008 National Championship, the team made the Grand Finals and placed fourth behind University of Wisconsin–Madison, University of Washington, and University of California, Berkeley, while defeating Brown University, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University.

In 2009, Northeastern eliminated its 74-year-old football program. From 1933 to 2009, the Northeastern Huskies football program&#x27;s all-time record was 290-365-17 (.444), it produced 20 All-Americans and won the 2002 Atlantic 10 Conference championship. Citing sparse attendance, numerous losing seasons and the expense to renovate Parsons Field to an acceptable standard, the university&#x27;s board of trustees voted on November 20, 2009, to end the football program. According to President Joseph Aoun, &quot;Leadership requires that we make these choices. This decision allows us to focus on our existing athletic programs.&quot;

In addition to intercollegiate athletics, Northeastern offers 40 club sports, including sailing, judo, rugby, lacrosse, Olympic-Style taekwondo, alpine skiing, squash, cycling, and ultimate Frisbee. In 2005 the women&#x27;s rugby team finished third in the nation in Division II, while in the same year the men&#x27;s rugby team won the largest annual tournament in the United States. Recently, the women&#x27;s rugby team competed and placed 11th at the Collegiate Rugby Championship. In the 2008–09 academic year the Northeastern Club Field Hockey and Women&#x27;s Basketball teams won their respective National Championships. From 2007 to 2009, the Northeastern Club Baseball team won three straight New England Club Baseball Association championships. The Club Taekwondo team placed 1st overall in Division II for the 2018–19 Season in the Eastern Collegiate Taekwondo Conference.

On May 25, 2010, the club baseball team defeated Penn State to win the National Club Baseball Association Division II World Series and the national championship.

===Ice hockey===
The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey teams compete in the Hockey East conference. Northeastern defeated Boston College, 4–2, to win the 2019 Beanpot. and in 2020, Northeastern beat Boston University, 5–4, in overtime to win the Beanpot for the third year in a row before losing in 2022 in the finals to Boston University. Northeastern also won the 2023 Beanpot in a shootout against Harvard and again in 2024 in a 4-3 OT win against Boston University. In addition to winning the Beanpot title, Northeastern took home both awards with the award for most valuable player being presented to Adam Gaudette and the Eberly Award being presented to Cayden Primeau who had a save percentage of .974 (making him the goalie with second highest save percentage to win the award in the 44 years the award has been given).

=== Traditions ===

==== Underwear (&quot;Undie&quot;) Run ====
Started in 2005, the Underwear Run is a Northeastern-sponsored event around fall midterm season in which students strip down to their underwear and run a track around campus and near parts of the city. The Northeastern University Police Department (NUPD) supervises the event to maintain the flow of traffic through the city. Students have described it as a &quot;liberating experience&quot; that &quot;brings a sense of community and builds school spirit.&quot; Though the event was officially cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19 concerns, it was unofficially organized by students in fall of 2021.

==== Husky Hunt ====
Organized by the Resident Student Association, Husky Hunt is a 24-hour city-wide scavenger hunt that has 50 teams of students roaming around the Greater Boston area in search of locations that correspond to clues, games, puzzles, and riddles. The scavenger hunt starts with a preliminary qualifying quiz of which only 1/3 of the total group of participating teams progress to the hunt.

<doc id="386003" wikidata="Q140295" url="?curid=386003" title="Zager and Evans">
<text>Zager and Evans was an American rock-pop duo active during the late 1960s and early 1970s, comprising Denny Zager (born February 14, 1944, Wymore, Nebraska) and Rick Evans (born January 20, 1943, Lincoln, Nebraska; died February 2018, Santa Fe, New Mexico). They are best known for their 1969 No. 1 hit single &quot;In the Year 2525&quot;, which earned them one-hit wonder status.

==History==

Denny Zager and Rick Evans met at Nebraska Wesleyan University in 1962. They were joined by drummer Danny Schindler (later of the Benders) in the Nebraska band the Eccentrics until Schindler&#x27;s tour of Vietnam in 1965. Evans also left in 1965 and reunited with Zager in 1968.

As Zager and Evans, the duo were backed by another Nebraska native, Mark Dalton, on bass. Their first drummer, Paul Maher, was later replaced by another Nebraskan, Dave Trupp. Trupp and Dalton were also the rhythm section in the Liberation Blues Band and backed Evans on some solo demo material prior to Zager and Evans&#x27;s recording of &quot;In the Year 2525&quot; in 1968.

==&quot;In the Year 2525&quot;==

Written by Evans, &quot;In the Year 2525 (Exordium &amp; Terminus)&quot; warned of the dangers of technology, portraying a future in which the human race was destroyed by its own technological and medical innovations. The last stanzas of the song suggest mankind undergoes a continuing cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.

&quot;In the Year 2525&quot; hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1969, ultimately claiming the top spot for six weeks. It also hit #1 in the UK and #2 in Australia. The song topped the charts at the time of two major cultural events: the first Moon landing on July 20, 1969 and the Woodstock Music Festival a month later. The record sold over four million copies by 1970 and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July 1969.

&quot;2525&quot; was originally written in 1964, but not recorded or released until 1968 on the Truth Records label. After radio stations in Lincoln and Omaha made &quot;2525&quot; a regional &quot;break-out&quot; hit record, RCA Records signed the duo and released the song with &quot;Little Kids&quot;, also written by Evans, as the B-side nationwide. Zager and Evans also immediately recorded an album of the same name, again using Trupp and Dalton as the primary rhythm section. Sales of the original hit recording, including singles sales, album usage and compilation inclusions, are estimated at over ten million worldwide. In Italy, the duo released an Italian version on RCA Victor 1583: &quot;Nell&#x27;anno 2033&quot; b/w &quot;Donna&quot; (&quot;Woman&quot;).

==Later recordings==
Zager and Evans are considered to be the archetypal one-hit wonder artists. Despite the success of &quot;2525&quot;, the follow-up single, &quot;Mr. Turnkey&quot;, failed to chart in the US and UK, as did subsequent releases. For many years, the duo was the only act to have a chart-topping hit on both sides of the Atlantic and never have another chart single in &quot;Billboard&quot; or the UK (until the Canadian band Magic! in 2013). Their third single, &quot;Listen to the People&quot;, appeared on the Cashbox chart at #100, while &quot;Mr. Turnkey&quot;/&quot;Cary Lynn Javes&quot; (double A-side) and &quot;Help One Man Today&quot; both charted in Australia, at #86 and #94 respectively.

After the success of &quot;2525&quot;, White Whale Records released an LP titled &quot;The Early Writings of Zager &amp; Evans and Others&quot; featuring recordings of the Eccentrics on side one and a band called J.K. and Co., who had no connection to Zager and Evans, on side two. After releasing two albums on RCA, Zager and Evans moved to Vanguard Records in 1971 for a final record, titled &quot;Food for the Mind&quot;.

Evans later released an album for Truth Records titled &quot;I Need This Song,&quot; a duet with Pam Herbert. In the late 1970s, he formed his own label, Fun Records, and released an album titled &quot;Fun Songs, Think Songs&quot; containing both new material and re-recordings of Zager and Evans material.

==Today==
Zager now builds custom guitars at Zager Guitars in Lincoln, Nebraska. 

Evans largely retired from public life but he continued to chat online with Dalton and his best friend, Nashville producer Gary Earl, until his death in February 2018.
Drummer Dave Trupp died in November 2015 at the age of 72. 

Mark Dalton still performs on bass in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.

<doc id="386009" wikidata="Q5421260" url="?curid=386009" title="Expletive infixation">
<text>Expletive infixation is a process by which an expletive or profanity is inserted into a word, usually for intensification. It is similar to tmesis, but not all instances are covered by the usual definition of &quot;tmesis&quot; because the words are not necessarily compounds.

The most commonly inserted English expletives are adjectival: either participles (&quot;fucking&quot;, &quot;mother-fucking&quot;, &quot;freaking&quot;, &quot;blooming&quot;, &quot;bleeding&quot;, &quot;damned&quot;, &quot;wretched&quot;) or adjectives (&quot;bloody&quot;).

== Rules of formation in English ==
Judgments of which formations of expletive infixation are acceptable are remarkably consistent. This suggests that the rules for the placement of the expletive are not arbitrary, but instead derive from fundamental aspects of English phonology.

A simple rule is that the insertion occurs at a syllable boundary, usually just before the primary stressed syllable. Thus, one hears &quot;abso-fuckin&#x27;-lutely&quot; rather than *&quot;ab-fuckin&#x27;-solutely&quot;. This rule is insufficient to describe examples such as &quot;un-fuckin&#x27;-believable&quot;, however, so that some modifications to this rule are proposed, such as morpheme boundaries taking precedence over stress. Counterexamples to this exception do exist: &quot;unbe-fuckin&#x27;-lievable&quot;.

A more fundamental theory due to John McCarthy is based on prosody. Its basic principle is that &quot;the metrical stress tree of the host is minimally restructured to accommodate the stress tree of the infix&quot;. For example, although &quot;unbelievable&quot; and &quot;irresponsible&quot; have identical stress patterns and the first syllable of each is a separate morpheme, the preferred insertion points are different: &quot;un-fuckin&#x27;-believable&quot;, but &quot;irre-fuckin&#x27;-sponsible&quot;. McCarthy explains this by saying they have different prosodic structures: un(be((lieva)ble)) but (irre)((sponsi)ble). The infix cannot fall between the syllables &quot;ir&quot; and &quot;re&quot; because they form a single prosodic foot.

== Examples in popular culture ==
* &quot;abso-bloomin&#x27;-lutely&quot; in &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Loverly&quot;, a song from &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;
* &quot;E-motherfucking-T!&quot; in &quot;Rosetta Stoned&quot;, a song by the band &quot;Tool&quot;
* &quot;Guaran-fucking-teed!&quot; in &quot;Contractor&quot;, a song by the band &quot;Lamb of God&quot;
* &quot;Viet-fuckin&#x27;-nam!&quot; from Abbie Hoffman (portrayed by Richard D&#x27;Alessandro) in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;
* &quot;Out-bloody-rageous&quot;, the title of a track in the album &quot;Third&quot; by the band Soft Machine
* &quot;un-bloody-hinged&quot; from the movie &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot;
* “Shomer-fucking-Shabbos” from the movie &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;

<doc id="386014" wikidata="Q234201" url="?curid=386014" title="Anna Chlumsky">
<text>Anna Maria Chlumsky ( ; born December 3, 1980) is an American actress. She began acting as a child, and first became known for playing Vada Sultenfuss in the film &quot;My Girl&quot; (1991) and its sequel, &quot;My Girl 2&quot;. Following her early roles, she went on hiatus from 1999 to 2005 to attend college.
Chlumsky returned to acting with roles in several independent films, including &quot;Blood Car&quot; (2007) and &quot;In the Loop&quot; (2009). She portrayed Amy Brookheimer on the HBO television series &quot;Veep&quot; (2012–2019), which earned her six nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, among other accolades.

==Early life==
Chlumsky was born in Chicago, the daughter of Nancy (), a singer, actress, and former flight attendant and Frank Chlumsky Jr. (a chef and saxophonist). She was raised in a Catholic family, and is of Czech and Croatian descent.

==Career==
Chlumsky entered show business at an early age, modeling with her mother in an advertising campaign; it was her lead roles in &quot;My Girl&quot; (1991) and &quot;My Girl 2&quot; (1994) that earned her praise for her acting. Her initial film role was a bit part in the family comedy &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; (1989), starring John Candy and her eventual &quot;My Girl&quot; co-star Macaulay Culkin. She also appeared in &quot;Trading Mom&quot; (1994) with Sissy Spacek, and in &quot;Gold Diggers: The Secret of Bear Mountain&quot; (1995) with Christina Ricci. Throughout the 1990s, Chlumsky starred in several films and TV series.

Chlumsky took a break from acting to attend the University of Chicago, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies in 2002. After college, she was hired as a fact-checker for the Zagat Survey and moved to New York City, which was followed by a position as an editorial assistant for a HarperCollins science fiction-fantasy imprint. However, she felt her career in the publishing industry was lackluster and unsatisfying, and ultimately returned to acting after she completed formal training at the Atlantic Acting School in Manhattan.

Chlumsky appeared as Mary Calvin in a 2007 episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;; and as Lisa Klein in 2010 episode. She appeared in the &quot;30 Rock&quot; episode &quot;The Fighting Irish&quot; as Liz Lemler, a romantic rival of protagonist Liz Lemon, who receives flowers meant for Lemler. Chlumsky was in four episodes of the ABC dramedy &quot;Cupid&quot; in 2009. Later that year, she starred in the Lifetime movie &quot;12 Men of Christmas&quot; as Jan Lucas.

She starred in the Off Broadway production of &quot;Unconditional&quot; by Brett C. Leonard at The Public Theater, which opened in February 2008; it was produced by the LAByrinth Theater Company. She also starred in Lanford Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot; in 2005 at the American Theatre of Actors in New York City.

In 2009, she appeared in Armando Iannucci&#x27;s BBC Films political satire &quot;In The Loop&quot;, co-starring with Peter Capaldi, Tom Hollander, Chris Addison, James Gandolfini, and Mimi Kennedy, a quasi-spinoff of Iannucci&#x27;s BBC TV series &quot;The Thick of It&quot;. She plays Liza, a State Department assistant in the movie. 

From 2012 to 2019, Chlumsky played Amy Brookheimer, aide to Julia Louis-Dreyfus&#x27;s character in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Veep&quot;, also produced by Iannucci. In June 2012, she starred in the world premiere of David Adjmi&#x27;s 3C at the Rattlestick Playwrights Theater in New York.

Dan Aykroyd, who played her father in the two &quot;My Girl&quot; films, has said that a script for a third film has been in development since 2003. In 2012, Chlumsky &quot;put to rest&quot; any rumors that such a film was in development. In addition to her role on &quot;Veep&quot;, Chlumsky has appeared in multiple television series between 2011 and 2013, including &quot;White Collar&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and NBC&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Hannibal&quot;.

Chlumsky has appeared on Broadway in &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot;, and beginning in 2015 as editor Iris Peabody in the comedy &quot;Living on Love&quot;, with Renee Fleming, Jerry O&#x27;Connell and Douglas Sills.

In 2017, Chlumsky appeared in the fourth season of AMC Networks&#x27; &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot; as Dr. Katie Herman, the love interest of Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy).

Chlumsky had a main role alongside Julia Garner in Shonda Rhimes&#x27; Netflix limited drama series &quot;Inventing Anna&quot;. Chlumsky voices Charlotte Pickles in the 2021 Paramount+ revival of &quot;Rugrats&quot;.

==Personal life==
In October 2007, Chlumsky announced her engagement to Army Reserve member Shaun So, who served a tour of duty in Afghanistan. They met as students at the University of Chicago in 2000. They married on March 8, 2008, in Brooklyn, and have two daughters, born July 2013 and August 2016.

<doc id="386023" wikidata="Q156058" url="?curid=386023" title="George F. Kennan">
<text>George Frost Kennan (February 16, 1904 – March 17, 2005) was an American diplomat and historian. He was best known as an advocate of a policy of containment of Soviet expansion during the Cold War. He lectured widely and wrote scholarly histories of the relations between the USSR and the United States. He was also one of the group of foreign policy elders known as &quot;The Wise Men&quot;.

During the late 1940s, his writings confirmed the Truman Doctrine and inspired the U.S. foreign policy of containing the USSR. His &quot;Long Telegram&quot; from Moscow in 1946 and the subsequent 1947 article &quot;The Sources of Soviet Conduct&quot; argued that the Soviet regime was inherently expansionist and that its influence had to be &quot;contained&quot; in areas of vital strategic importance to the United States. These texts provided justification for the Truman administration&#x27;s new anti-Soviet policy. Kennan played a major role in the development of definitive Cold War programs and institutions, notably the Marshall Plan.

Soon after his concepts had become U.S. policy, Kennan began to criticize the foreign policies that he had helped articulate. By late 1948, Kennan became confident that the US could commence positive dialogue with the Soviet government. His proposals were dismissed by the Truman administration, and Kennan&#x27;s influence waned, particularly after Dean Acheson was appointed Secretary of State in 1949. Soon thereafter, U.S. Cold War strategy assumed a more assertive and militaristic quality, causing Kennan to lament what he believed was an abrogation of his previous assessments.

In 1950, Kennan left the State Department—except for a brief ambassadorial stint in Moscow and a longer one in Yugoslavia—and became a realist critic of U.S. foreign policy. He continued to analyze international affairs as a faculty member of the Institute for Advanced Study from 1956 until his death in 2005 at age 101.

== Early life ==
Kennan was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Kossuth Kent Kennan, a lawyer specializing in tax law, and Florence James Kennan. His father was a descendant of impoverished Scots-Irish settlers from 18th-century Connecticut and Massachusetts, and had been named after the Hungarian patriot Lajos Kossuth (1802–94). His mother died two months later due to peritonitis from a ruptured appendix, though Kennan long believed that she died after giving birth to him. The boy always lamented not having a mother. He was never close to his father or stepmother; however, he was close to his older sisters.

At the age of eight, he went to Germany to stay with his stepmother in order to learn German. During the summers of 1915 and 1916, he attended Camp Highlands in Sayner, Wisconsin, then known as the Wisconsin Highlands Summer Camp. He attended St. John&#x27;s Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin, and arrived at Princeton University in the second half of 1921. Unaccustomed to the elite atmosphere of the Ivy League, the shy and introverted Kennan found his undergraduate years difficult and lonely.

==Diplomatic career==
===First steps===
After receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree in history in 1925, Kennan considered applying to law school, but decided it was too expensive and instead opted to apply to the newly formed United States Foreign Service. He passed the qualifying examination and after seven months of study at the Foreign Service School in Washington, he obtained his first job as a vice consul in Geneva, Switzerland. Within a year, he was transferred to a post in Hamburg, Germany. In 1928, Kennan considered quitting the Foreign Service to return to a university for graduate studies. Instead, he was selected for a linguist training program that would give him three years of graduate-level study without having to quit the service.

In 1929, Kennan began his program in history, politics, culture, and the Russian language at the Oriental Institute of the University of Berlin. In doing so, he followed in the footsteps of his grandfather&#x27;s younger cousin, George Kennan (1845–1924), a major 19th century expert on Imperial Russia and author of &quot;Siberia and the Exile System&quot;, a well-received 1891 account of the Czarist prison system. During the course of his diplomatic career, Kennan would master a number of other languages, including German, French, Polish, Czech, Portuguese, and Norwegian.

In 1931 Kennan was stationed at the legation in Riga, Latvia, where, as third secretary, he worked on Soviet economic affairs. From his job, Kennan &quot;grew to mature interest in Russian affairs&quot;. When the U.S. began formal diplomacy with the Soviet government during 1933 after the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Kennan accompanied Ambassador William C. Bullitt to Moscow. By the mid-1930s, Kennan was among the professionally trained Russian experts of the staff of the United States Embassy in Moscow, along with Charles E. Bohlen and Loy W. Henderson. These officials had been influenced by the long-time director of the State Department&#x27;s division of East European Affairs, Robert F. Kelley. They believed that there was little basis for cooperation with the Soviet Union, even against potential adversaries. Meanwhile, Kennan studied Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, which would affect his opinion of the internal dynamics of the Soviet regime for the rest of his life.

===At the Soviet Embassy===
Kennan found himself in strong disagreement with Joseph E. Davies, Bullitt&#x27;s successor as ambassador to the Soviet Union, who defended the Great Purge and other aspects of Stalin&#x27;s rule. Kennan did not have any influence on Davies&#x27; decisions, and Davies himself even suggested that Kennan be transferred out of Moscow for &quot;his health&quot;. Kennan again contemplated resigning from the service, but instead decided to accept the Russian desk at the State Department in Washington. A man with a high opinion of himself, Kennan began writing the first draft of his memoirs at the age of 34 when he was still a relatively junior diplomat. In a letter to his sister Jeannette in 1935, Kennan expressed his disenchantment with American life, writing: “I hate the rough and tumble of our political life. I hate democracy; I hate the press... I hate the ‘peepul’; I have become clearly un-American&quot;.

===Prague and Berlin===
By September 1938, Kennan had been reassigned to a job at the legation in Prague. After the occupation of the Czechoslovak Republic by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II, Kennan was assigned to Berlin. There, he endorsed the United States&#x27; Lend-Lease policy but warned against any notion of American endorsement of the Soviets, whom he considered unfit allies. He was interned in Germany for six months after Germany, followed by the other Axis states, in December 1941.

===Lisbon calls===
In September 1942 Kennan was assigned to the legation in Lisbon, Portugal, where he begrudgingly performed a job administering intelligence and base operations. In July 1943 Bert Fish, the American Ambassador in Lisbon, suddenly died, and Kennan became chargé d&#x27;affaires and the head of the American Embassy in Portugal. While in Lisbon Kennan played a decisive role in getting Portugal&#x27;s approval for the use of the Azores Islands by American naval and air forces during World War II. Initially confronted with clumsy instructions and lack of coordination from Washington, Kennan took the initiative by personally talking to President Roosevelt and obtained from the President a letter to the Portuguese premier, Salazar, that unlocked the concession of facilities in the Azores.

===Second Soviet posting===
In January 1944, he was sent to London, where he served as counselor of the American delegation to the European Advisory Commission, which worked to prepare Allied policy in Europe. There, Kennan became even more disenchanted with the State Department, which he believed was ignoring his qualifications as a trained specialist. However, within months of beginning the job, he was appointed deputy chief of the mission in Moscow upon request of W. Averell Harriman, the ambassador to the USSR.

==== The &quot;Long Telegram&quot; ====
In Moscow, Kennan again felt that his opinions were being ignored by President Truman and policymakers in Washington. Kennan tried repeatedly to persuade policymakers to abandon plans for cooperation with the Soviet government in favor of a sphere of influence policy in Europe to reduce the Soviets&#x27; power there. Kennan believed that a federation needed to be established in western Europe to counter Soviet influence in the region and to compete against the Soviet stronghold in eastern Europe.

Kennan served as deputy head of the mission in Moscow until April 1946. Near the end of that term, the Treasury Department requested that the State Department explain recent Soviet behavior, such as its disinclination to endorse the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Kennan responded on February 22, 1946, by sending a lengthy 5,363-word telegram (sometimes cited as being more than 8,000 words), commonly called &quot;The Long Telegram&quot;, from Moscow to Secretary of State James Byrnes outlining a new strategy for diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The ideas Kennan expressed in the Long Telegram were not new but the argument he made and the vivid language he used in making it came at an opportune moment. At the &quot;bottom of the Kremlin&#x27;s neurotic view of world affairs is the traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity&quot;. After the Russian Revolution, this sense of insecurity became mixed with communist ideology and &quot;Oriental secretiveness and conspiracy&quot;.

Soviet international behavior depended mainly on the internal necessities of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s regime; according to Kennan, Stalin needed a hostile world in order to legitimize his autocratic rule. Stalin thus used Marxism-Leninism as a &quot;justification for the Soviet Union&#x27;s instinctive fear of the outside world, for the dictatorship without which they did not know how to rule, for cruelties they did not dare not to inflict, for sacrifice they felt bound to demand  ... Today they cannot dispense with it. It is the fig leaf of their moral and intellectual respectability&quot;.

The solution was to strengthen Western institutions in order to render them invulnerable to the Soviet challenge while awaiting the mellowing of the Soviet regime. Using propaganda and culture was vital to Kennan, it was important that America presented itself correctly to foreign audiences and the Soviets would limit the cultural cross contamination of America and USSR.

Kennan&#x27;s new policy of containment, in the words of his later &#x27;X&#x27; article, was that Soviet pressure had to &quot;be contained by the adroit and vigilant application of counterforce at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points&quot;.

===At the National War College===
The long telegram dispatch brought Kennan to the attention of Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, a major advocate of a confrontational policy with regard to the Soviets, the United States&#x27; former wartime ally. Forrestal helped bring Kennan back to Washington, where he served as the first deputy for foreign affairs at the National War College and then strongly influenced his decision to publish the &quot;X&quot; article.

Meanwhile, in March 1947, Truman appeared before Congress to request funding for the Truman Doctrine to fight Communism in Greece. &quot;I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.&quot;

==== &quot;X&quot; ====

Unlike the &quot;long telegram,&quot; Kennan&#x27;s well-timed article appearing in the July 1947 issue of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;X&quot;, titled &quot;&quot;, did not begin by emphasizing &quot;traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity&quot;; instead, it asserted that Stalin&#x27;s policy was shaped by a combination of Marxist–Leninist ideology, which advocated revolution to defeat the capitalist forces in the outside world and Stalin&#x27;s determination to use the notion of &quot;capitalist encirclement&quot; in order to legitimize his regimentation of Soviet society so that he could consolidate his political power. Kennan argued that Stalin would not (and moreover could not) moderate the supposed Soviet determination to overthrow Western governments. Thus:

The goal of his policy was to withdraw all U.S. forces from Europe. &quot;The settlement reached would give the Kremlin sufficient reassurance against the establishment of regimes in Eastern Europe hostile to the Soviet Union, tempering the degree of control over that area that the Soviet leaders felt it necessary to exercise&quot;.

Kennan further argued that the United States would have to perform this containment alone, but if it could do so without undermining its own economic health and political stability, the Soviet party structure would undergo a period of immense strain eventually resulting in &quot;either the break-up or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power.&quot;

The publication of the &quot;X&quot; article soon began one of the more intense debates of the Cold War. Walter Lippmann, a leading American commentator on international affairs, strongly criticized the &quot;X&quot; article. Lippmann argued that Kennan&#x27;s strategy of containment was &quot;a strategic monstrosity&quot; that could &quot;be implemented only by recruiting, subsidizing, and supporting a heterogeneous array of satellites, clients, dependents, and puppets&quot;. Lippmann argued that diplomacy should be the basis of relations with the Soviets; he suggested that the U.S. withdraw its forces from Europe and reunify and demilitarize Germany. Meanwhile, it was soon revealed informally that &quot;X&quot; was indeed Kennan. This information seemed to give the &quot;X&quot; article the status of an official document expressing the Truman administration&#x27;s new policy toward Moscow.

Kennan had not intended the &quot;X&quot; article as a prescription for policy. For the rest of his life, Kennan continued to reiterate that the article did not imply an automatic commitment to resist Soviet &quot;expansionism&quot; wherever it occurred, with little distinction of primary and secondary interests. The article did not make it obvious that Kennan favored employing political and economic rather than military methods as the chief agent of containment. &quot;My thoughts about containment,&quot; said Kennan in a 1996 interview to CNN, &quot;were of course distorted by the people who understood it and pursued it exclusively as a military concept; and I think that that, as much as any other cause, led to [the] 40 years of unnecessary, fearfully expensive and disoriented process of the Cold War&quot;.

Additionally, the administration made few attempts to explain the distinction between Soviet influence and international Communism to the U.S. public. &quot;In part, this failure reflected the belief of many in Washington,&quot; writes historian John Lewis Gaddis, &quot;that only the prospect of an undifferentiated global threat could shake Americans out of their isolationist tendencies that remained latent among them.&quot;

In a PBS television interview with David Gergen in 1996, Kennan again reiterated that he did not regard the Soviets as primarily a military threat, noting that &quot;they were not like Hitler.&quot; Kennan&#x27;s opinion was that this misunderstanding
The &quot;X&quot; article meant sudden fame for Kennan. After the long telegram, he recalled later, &quot;My official loneliness came in fact to an end  ... My reputation was made. My voice now carried.&quot;

==== Influence under Marshall ====
Between April 1947 and December 1948, when George C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan was more influential than he was at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and had him create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department&#x27;s internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare policy recommendations. Kennan played a central role in the drafting of the Marshall Plan.

Although Kennan regarded the Soviet Union as too weak to risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in Western Europe, which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War. To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan&#x27;s solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and Western Europe to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so, the United States would help to rebuild the balance of power. In June 1948, Kennan proposed covert assistance to left-wing parties not oriented toward Moscow and to labor unions in Western Europe in order to engineer a rift between Moscow and working-class movements in Western Europe. In 1947, Kennan supported Truman&#x27;s decision to extend economic aid to the Greek government fighting a civil war against Communist guerrillas, though he argued against military aid. The historian John Iatrides argued that Kennan&#x27;s claim that the Soviet Union would go to war if the United States gave military aid to Greece is hard to square with his claim that the Soviet Union was too weak to risk war, and the real reason for his opposition to military aid was that he did not regard Greece as very important.

As the United States was initiating the Marshall Plan, Kennan and the Truman administration hoped that the Soviet Union&#x27;s rejection of Marshall aid would strain its relations with its Communist allies in Eastern Europe. Kennan initiated a series of efforts to exploit the schism between the Soviets and Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia. Kennan proposed conducting covert action in the Balkans to further decrease Moscow&#x27;s influence.

The administration&#x27;s new vigorously anti-Soviet policy also became evident when, at Kennan&#x27;s suggestion, the U.S. changed its hostility to Francisco Franco&#x27;s anti-communist regime in Spain in order to secure U.S. influence in the Mediterranean. Kennan had observed during 1947 that the Truman Doctrine implied a new consideration of Franco. His suggestion soon helped begin a new phase of U.S.–Spanish relations, which ended with military cooperation after 1950. Kennan played an important role in devising the plans for American economic aid to Greece, insisting upon a capitalist mode of development and upon economic integration with the rest of Europe. In the case of Greece, most of the Marshall Plan aid went towards rebuilding a war-devastated country that was already very poor even before World War II. Though Marshall Plan aid to Greece was successful in building or rebuilding ports, railroads, paved roads, a hydro-electricity transmission system, and a nationwide telephone system, the attempt to impose &quot;good government&quot; on Greece was less successful. The Greek economy was historically dominated by a &quot;rentier&quot; system in which a few wealthy families, a highly politicized officer corps and the royal family controlled the economy for their own benefit. Kennan&#x27;s advice to open up the Greek economy was completely ignored by the Greek elite. Kennan supported France&#x27;s war to regain control of Vietnam as he argued that control of Southeast Asia with its raw materials was critical to the economic recovery of Western Europe and Japan, but by 1949, he changed his views, becoming convinced that the French would never defeat the Communist Viet Minh guerrillas.

In 1949, Kennan suggested what became known as &quot;Program A&quot; or &quot;Plan A&quot; for the reunification of Germany, stating the partition of Germany was unsustainable in the long run. Kennan argued that the American people would sooner or later grow tired of occupying their zone in Germany and would inevitably demand the pull-out of U.S. troops. Or alternatively Kennan predicted the Soviets would pull their forces out of East Germany, knowing full well that they could easily return from their bases in Poland, forcing the United States to do likewise, but as the Americans lacked bases in other Western European nations, this would hand the advantage to the Soviets. Finally, Kennan argued that the German people were very proud and would not stand having their nation occupied by foreigners forever, making a solution to the &quot;German question&quot; imperative. Kennan&#x27;s solution was for the reunification and neutralization of Germany; the withdrawal of most of the British, American, French and Soviet forces from Germany with the exception of small enclaves near the border that would be supplied by sea; and a four-power commission from the four occupying powers that would have the ultimate say while allowing the Germans to mostly govern themselves.

==== Differences with Acheson ====
Kennan&#x27;s influence rapidly decreased when Dean Acheson became Secretary of State, succeeding the ailing George Marshall during 1949 and 1950. Acheson did not regard the Soviet &quot;threat&quot; as chiefly political, and he saw the Berlin Blockade starting in June 1948, the first Soviet test of a nuclear weapon in August 1949, the Communist revolution in China a month later, and the beginning of the Korean War in June 1950, as evidence. Truman and Acheson decided to delineate the Western sphere of influence and to create a system of alliances. Kennan argued in a paper that the mainland of Asia be excluded from the &quot;containment&quot; policies, writing that the United States was &quot;greatly overextended in its whole thinking about what we can accomplish and should try to accomplish&quot; in Asia. Instead, he argued that Japan and the Philippines should serve as the &quot;cornerstone of a Pacific security system&quot;.

Acheson approved Program A shortly after he took up office as Secretary of State, writing in the margin of Kennan&#x27;s paper that the &quot;division of Germany was not an end onto itself&quot;. However, Plan A encountered massive objections from the Pentagon, who saw it as abandoning West Germany to the Soviet Union, and from within the State Department, with the diplomat Robert Murphy arguing that the mere existence of a prosperous and democratic West Germany would be destabilizing to East Germany, and hence the Soviet Union. More important, Plan A required the approval of the British and French governments, but neither was in favor of Program A, complaining it was far too early to end the occupation of Germany. Both public opinion in Britain and even more so in France were afraid of what might happen if the Allies loosened their control over Germany just four years after the end of World War II, and for reasons of geography and history, did not share Kennan&#x27;s assurance that a reunified Germany would cause difficulties only for the Soviets. In May 1949, a distorted version of Plan A was leaked to the French press with the principal distortion being that the United States was willing to pull out of all of Europe in exchange for a reunified and neutral Germany. In the ensuing uproar, Acheson disallowed Plan A.

Kennan lost influence with Acheson, who in any case relied much less on his staff than Marshall had. Kennan resigned as director of policy planning in December 1949 but stayed in the department as counselor until June 1950. In January 1950, Acheson replaced Kennan with Nitze, who was much more comfortable with the calculus of military power. Afterwards, Kennan accepted an appointment as Visitor to the Institute for Advanced Study from fellow moderate Robert Oppenheimer, director of the institute. In October 1949, the Chinese Communists under Mao Zedong won the Chinese Civil War and proclaimed the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The &quot;Loss of China&quot;, as it has become known in the United States, prompted a fierce right-wing backlash led by Republican politicians such as Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, who used the &quot;loss of China&quot; as a convenient club with which to beat the Democratic Truman administration. Truman, Acheson, and other high officials such as Kennan were all accused of being criminally negligent at best in permitting the supposed loss. One of Kennan&#x27;s closest friends, the diplomat John Paton Davies Jr. found himself under investigation in November 1949 as a Soviet spy for his role in the process, an allegation that would destroy his career and which horrified Kennan. What especially disturbed Kennan was that Paton Davies was accused of treason for predicting in a report that Mao would win the Chinese Civil War, which in the climate of hysteria caused by the &quot;loss of China&quot; was enough to lead the FBI to begin investigating him as a Soviet spy. Speaking of the Paton Davies case, Kennan warned that &quot;We have no protection against this happening again&quot;, leading him to wonder what diplomat would be investigated next for treason.

Kennan found the atmosphere of hysteria, which was labeled as &quot;McCarthyism&quot; in March 1950 by cartoonist Herbert Block, to be deeply uncomfortable.

Acheson&#x27;s policy was realized as NSC 68, a classified report issued by the United States National Security Council in April 1950 and written by Paul Nitze, Kennan&#x27;s successor as Director of Policy Planning. Kennan and Charles Bohlen, another State Department expert on Russia, argued about the wording of NSC68, which became the basis of Cold War policy. Kennan rejected the idea that Stalin had a grand design for world conquest implicit in Nitze&#x27;s report and argued that he actually feared overextending Russian power. Kennan even argued that NSC68 should not have been drafted at all, as it would make U.S. policies too rigid, simplistic, and militaristic. Acheson overruled Kennan and Bohlen, endorsing the assumption of Soviet menace implied by NSC68.

Kennan opposed the building of the hydrogen bomb and the rearmament of Germany, which were policies encouraged by the assumptions of NSC68. During the Korean War (which began when North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950), when rumors started circulating in the State Department that plans were being made to advance beyond the 38th parallel into North Korea, an act that Kennan considered dangerous, he engaged in intense arguments with Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East Dean Rusk, who apparently endorsed Acheson&#x27;s goal to forcibly unite the Koreas.

====Memo to Dulles====
On 21 August 1950, Kennan submitted a long memo to John Foster Dulles who at the time was engaged in working on the U.S-Japanese peace treaty in which he went beyond American-Japanese relations to offer an outline of his thinking about Asia in general. He called U.S. policy thinking about Asia as &quot;little promising&quot; and &quot;fraught with danger&quot;. About the Korean War, Kennan wrote that American policies were based upon what he called &quot;emotional, moralistic attitudes&quot; which &quot;unless corrected, can easily carry us toward real conflict with the Russians and inhibit us from making a realistic agreement about that area&quot;. He supported the decision to intervene in Korea, but wrote that &quot;it is not essential to us to see an anti-Soviet Korean regime extended to all of Korea.&quot; Kennan expressed much fear about what General Douglas MacArthur might do, saying he had &quot;wide and relatively uncontrolled latitude...in determining our policy in the north Asian and western Pacific areas&quot;, which Kennan viewed as a problem as he felt MacArthur&#x27;s judgement was poor.

====Criticism of American diplomacy====
Kennan&#x27;s 1951 book &quot;American Diplomacy, 1900–1950&quot;, strongly criticized American foreign policy of the last 50 years. He warned against U.S. participation and reliance on multilateral, legalistic and moralistic organizations such as the United Nations.

Despite his influence, Kennan was never really comfortable in government. He always regarded himself as an outsider and had little patience with critics. W. Averell Harriman, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow when Kennan was deputy between 1944 and 1946, remarked that Kennan was &quot;a man who understood Russia but not the United States&quot;.

=== Ambassador to the Soviet Union ===
In December 1951, President Truman nominated Kennan to be the next United States ambassador to the USSR. His appointment was endorsed strongly by the Senate.

In many respects (to Kennan&#x27;s consternation) the priorities of the administration emphasized creating alliances against the Soviets more than negotiating differences with them. In his memoirs, Kennan recalled, &quot;So far as I could see, we were expecting to be able to gain our objectives  ... without making any concessions though, only &#x27;if we were really all-powerful, and could hope to get away with it.&#x27; I very much doubted that this was the case.&quot;

At Moscow, Kennan found the atmosphere even more regimented than on his previous trips, with police guards following him everywhere, discouraging contact with Soviet citizens. At the time, Soviet propaganda charged the U.S. with preparing for war, which Kennan did not wholly dismiss. &quot;I began to ask myself whether  ... we had not contributed  ... by the overmilitarization of our policies and statements  ... to a belief in Moscow that it was war we were after, that we had settled for its inevitability, that it was only a matter of time before we would unleash it.&quot;

In September 1952, Kennan made a statement that cost him his ambassadorship. In an answer to a question at a press conference, Kennan compared his conditions at the ambassador&#x27;s residence in Moscow to those he had encountered while interned in Berlin during the first few months of hostilities between the United States and Germany. While his statement was not unfounded, the Soviets interpreted it as an implied analogy with Nazi Germany. The Soviets then declared Kennan &quot;persona non grata&quot; and refused to allow him to re-enter the USSR. Kennan acknowledged retrospectively that it was a &quot;foolish thing for me to have said&quot;.

===Criticism of diplomacy under Truman===
Kennan was very critical of the Truman administration&#x27;s policy of supporting France in Vietnam, writing that the French were fighting a &quot;hopeless&quot; war, &quot;which neither they nor we, nor both of us together, can win.&quot; About what he called the &quot;rival Chinese regimes&quot; (i.e. the People&#x27;s Republic of China on the mainland and the Republic of China on Taiwan), Kennan predicated that the U.S. policy of supporting the Kuomintang government in Taiwan would &quot;strengthen Peiping [Beijing]–Moscow solidarity rather than weaken it&quot;. Anticipating playing the &quot;China card&quot; strategy, Kennan argued that the United States should work to divide the Sino-Soviet bloc which had the potential to dominate Eurasia, and to this end should give China&#x27;s seat on the UN Security Council to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In the atmosphere of rage and fury caused by the &quot;loss of China&quot; in 1950, it was politically impossible for the Truman administration to recognize the government in Beijing, and giving China&#x27;s United Nations seat to the People&#x27;s Republic was the closest the United States could go in building a relationship with the new government. About the ostensible subject of his paper, Kennan called Japan the &quot;most important single factor in Asia&quot;. Kennan advocated a deal with the Soviet Union where in exchange for ending the Korean War the United States would ensure that Japan would remain a demilitarized and neutral state in the Cold War.

Kennan&#x27;s basic concept governing his thinking on foreign policy was that of the &quot;five industrialized zones&quot;, the control of majority of which would make for the dominant world power. The &quot;five industrialized zones&quot; were the United States; Great Britain; the area around the Rhine river valley, namely the Rhineland and the Ruhr regions of Germany, eastern France, and the Low Countries; the Soviet Union and Japan. Kennan argued that if the &quot;industrialized zones&quot; except for the Soviet Union were aligned with the United States, then his country would be the world&#x27;s dominant power. As such, &quot;containment&quot; applied only to the control of the &quot;industrialized zones&quot; of the world. Kennan had considerable disdain for the peoples of the Third World, and he viewed European rule over much of Asia and Africa as natural and normal. These views were typical of American officials in the late 1940s, but Kennan was unusual in retaining these views for the rest of his life; by the 1950s, many officials such as the Dulleses had come to feel that the perception that the average white American disliked non-white peoples was hurting America&#x27;s image in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, and this in turn was giving the advantage to the Soviet Union. Kennan felt that the United States should in general not be involved in the Third World as he felt there was nothing worth having there. There were some exceptions as Kennan regarded Latin America as being in the American sphere of influence as he felt that Washington should inform the leaders of the Latin American republics that they should &quot;be careful not to wander too far from our side&quot;. Acheson was so offended by a report Kennan wrote in March 1950 in which he suggested that miscegenation between Europeans, Indians and African slaves was the root cause of Latin America&#x27;s economic backwardness that he refused to have it distributed to the rest of the State Department. Kennan felt that both the oil of Iran and the Suez Canal were important to the West, and he recommended the United States should support Britain against the demands of Mohammad Mosaddegh and Mostafa El-Nahas to respectively take control of the Iranian oil industry and the Suez Canal. Kennan wrote that Abadan (the center of the Iranian oil industry) and the Suez Canal were crucial for the West for economic reasons, which justified the use of &quot;military strength&quot; by the Western powers to keep control of these places.

=== Kennan and the Eisenhower administration ===
Kennan returned to Washington, where he became embroiled in disagreements with Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s hawkish Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. Even so, he was able to work constructively with the new administration. During the summer of 1953 President Eisenhower asked Kennan to manage the first of a series of top-secret teams, dubbed Operation Solarium, examining the advantages and disadvantages of continuing the Truman administration&#x27;s policy of containment and of seeking to &quot;roll back&quot; existing areas of Soviet influence. Upon completion of the project, the president seemed to endorse the group&#x27;s recommendations.

By lending his prestige to Kennan&#x27;s position, the president tacitly signaled his intention to formulate the strategy of his administration within the framework of its predecessor&#x27;s, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower&#x27;s concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.

In 1954, Kennan appeared as a character witness for J. Robert Oppenheimer during the government&#x27;s efforts to revoke his security clearance. Despite his departure from government service, Kennan was frequently still consulted by the officials of the Eisenhower administration. When the CIA obtained the transcript of Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;Secret Speech&quot; attacking Stalin in May 1956, Kennan was one of the first people to whom the text of the &quot;Secret Speech&quot; was shown.

On 11 October 1956, Kennan testified to the House Committee of Foreign Affairs about the massive protests going on in Poland that Soviet rule in Eastern Europe was &quot;eroding more rapidly than I ever anticipated&quot;. The fact that a nationalist faction of the Polish Communist Party led by Władysław Gomułka overthrew the Stalinist leadership in Warsaw over the objections of Khrushchev, who was forced to reluctantly accept the change in leadership, led Kennan to predicate that Poland was moving in a &quot;Titoist&quot; direction as Gomułka for his all commitment to Communism also made it clear that he wanted Poland to be more independent of Moscow. In 1957, Kennan departed the United States to work as the George Eastman Professor at Balliol College at Oxford. Sir Isaiah Berlin wrote that Kennan expected the Fellows of Balliol College to be engaged in conversation &quot;polished by deep tradition, refinement, moral quality&quot; and was instead disgusted to find that Fellows were engrossed in &quot;a lot of idle gossip about local affairs, academic titles. He was horrified about that. Profound disappointment. England was not as he thought. An idealised image has been shattered&quot;. Kennan wrote about the Fellows of Balliol College in a letter to Oppenheimer: &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen such back-biting, such fury, such fractions in all my life&quot;. In the same letter, Kennan wrote that the only Fellow with whom he could have a &quot;serious conversation&quot; was Berlin, and the rest were all obsessed with spreading malicious gossip about each other. However, Kennan was popular with the students at Balliol College as his twice weekly lectures on international relations were as he put it &quot;tremendously successful&quot;, indeed to such an extent that he had to be assigned a larger lecture hall as hundreds of students lined up to hear him speak.

In October 1957, Kennan delivered the Reith lectures on the BBC under the title &quot;Russia, the Atom and the West&quot;, stating that if the partition of Germany continued, then &quot;the chances for peace are very slender indeed&quot;. Kennan defended the partition of Germany in 1945 as necessary, but went on to say: To resolve the &quot;German question&quot;, Kennan advocated a version of his &quot;program A&quot; of 1949 calling for the complete withdraw of most of the British, French, American and Soviet forces from Germany as a prelude to German reunification and for the neutralization of Germany. Besides his call to a solution to the &quot;German question&quot;, Kennan also predicated that Soviet rule in Eastern Europe was &quot;shaky&quot;, and the best thing the Western powers could do was to pursue a firm, but essentially non-confrontational policy towards the Soviet Union to persuade Khrushchev it would not be dangerous for him to let Eastern Europe go. The Reith lectures caused much controversy, and involved Kennan in a very public war of words with Acheson and the vice president Richard Nixon about the correct solution to the &quot;German question&quot;. The West German foreign minister, Heinrich von Brentano, stated about Kennan&#x27;s Reith lectures: &quot;Whoever says these things is no friend of the German people&quot;.

=== Ambassador to Yugoslavia ===
During John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1960 presidential election campaign Kennan wrote to the future president to offer some suggestions on how his administration should improve the country&#x27;s foreign affairs. Kennan wrote, &quot;What is needed is a succession of  ... calculated steps, timed in such a way as not only to throw the adversary off balance but to keep him off it, and prepared with sufficient privacy so that the advantage of surprise can be retained.&quot; He also urged the administration to &quot;assure a divergence of outlook and policy between the Russians and Chinese,&quot; which could be accomplished by improving relations with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev who had wanted to distance himself from the Communist Chinese. He wrote: &quot;We should  ... without deceiving ourselves about Khrushchev&#x27;s political personality and without nurturing any unreal hopes, be concerned to keep him politically in the running and to encourage the survival in Moscow of the tendencies he personifies&quot;. Additionally, he recommended that the United States work toward creating divisions within the Soviet bloc by undermining its power in Eastern Europe and encouraging the independent propensities of satellite governments.

Although Kennan had not been considered for a job by Kennedy&#x27;s advisers, the president himself offered Kennan the choice of ambassadorship in either Poland or Yugoslavia. Kennan was more interested in Yugoslavia, so he accepted Kennedy&#x27;s offer and began his job in Yugoslavia during May 1961.

Kennan was tasked with trying to strengthen Yugoslavia&#x27;s policy against the Soviets and to encourage other states in the Eastern bloc to pursue autonomy from the Soviets. Kennan found his ambassadorship in Belgrade to be much improved from his experiences in Moscow a decade earlier. He commented, &quot;I was favored in being surrounded with a group of exceptionally able and loyal assistants, whose abilities I myself admired, whose judgment I valued, and whose attitude toward myself was at all times  ... enthusiastically cooperative  ... Who was I to complain?&quot; Kennan found the Yugoslav government treated the American diplomats politely, in contrast from the way in which the Russians treated him in Moscow. He wrote that the Yugoslavs &quot;considered me, rightly or wrongly, a distinguished person in the U.S., and they were pleased that someone whose name they had heard before was being sent to Belgrade&quot;.

Kennan found it difficult to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy&#x27;s decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito&#x27;s confidence in the American foreign policy establishment, but his efforts were compromised by a pair of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.

Relations between Yugoslavia and the United States quickly began to worsen. In September 1961, Tito held a conference of nonaligned nations, where he delivered speeches that the U.S. government interpreted as being pro-Soviet. According to historian David Mayers, Kennan argued that Tito&#x27;s perceived pro-Soviet policy was in fact a ploy to &quot;buttress Khrushchev&#x27;s position within the Politburo against hardliners opposed to improving relations with the West and against China, which was pushing for a major Soviet–U.S. showdown&quot;. This policy also earned Tito &quot;credit in the Kremlin to be drawn upon against future Chinese attacks on his communist credentials&quot;. While politicians and government officials expressed growing concern about Yugoslavia&#x27;s relationship with the Soviets, Kennan believed that the country had an &quot;anomalous position in the Cold War that objectively suited U.S. purposes&quot;. Kennan also believed that within a few years, Yugoslavia&#x27;s example would cause states in the Eastern bloc to demand more social and economic autonomy from the Soviets.

By 1962, Congress had passed legislation to deny financial aid grants to Yugoslavia, to withdraw the sale of spare parts for Yugoslav warplanes, and to revoke the country&#x27;s most favored nation status. Kennan strongly protested the legislation, arguing that it would only result in a straining of relations between Yugoslavia and the U.S. Kennan came to Washington during the summer of 1962 to lobby against the legislation but was unable to elicit a change from Congress. President Kennedy endorsed Kennan privately but remained noncommittal publicly, as he did not want to jeopardize his slim majority support in Congress on a potentially contentious issue.

In a lecture to the staff of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade on 27 October 1962, Kennan came out very strongly in support of Kennedy&#x27;s policies in the Cuban Missile Crisis, saying that Cuba was still in the American sphere of influence and as such the Soviets had no right to place missiles in Cuba. In his speech, Kennan called Fidel Castro&#x27;s regime &quot;one of the bloodiest dictatorships the world has seen in the entire postwar period&quot;, which justified Kennedy&#x27;s efforts to overthrow the Communist Cuban government. Against Khrushchev&#x27;s demand that American missiles be pulled out of Turkey as the price for pulling Soviet missiles out of Cuba, Kennan stated Turkey was never in the Soviet sphere of influence whereas Cuba was in the American sphere of influence, which for him made it legitimate for the United States to place missiles in Turkey and illegitimate for the Soviet Union to place missiles in Cuba.

In December 1962 when Tito visited Moscow to meet with Khrushchev, Kennan reported to Washington that Tito was a Russophile as he lived in Russia between 1915 and 1920, and still had sentimental memories of the Russian Revolution of 1917, which had converted him to Communism. However, Kennan observed from his dealings with Tito that he was very firmly committed to keeping Yugoslavia neutral in the Cold War, and his expressions of affection for Russian culture during his visit to Moscow did not mean that he wanted Yugoslavia back into the Soviet bloc. Accordingly, to Kennan, the Sino-Soviet split had caused Khrushchev to want a reconciliation with Tito to counter the Chinese charge that the Soviet Union was a bullying imperialist power, and Tito was willing to accept better relations with the Soviet Union to improve his bargaining power with the West. Kennan also described Tito&#x27;s championing of the non-aligned movement as a way of improving Yugoslavia&#x27;s bargaining power with both West and East, as it allowed him to cast himself as a world leader who spoke for an important bloc of nations instead of being based on the &quot;intrinsic value&quot; of the non-aligned movement (which was actually little as most of the non-aligned nations were poor Third World nations). In this regard, Kennan reported to Washington that senior Yugoslav officials had told him that Tito&#x27;s speeches praising the non-aligned movement were just diplomatic posturing that should not be taken too seriously.

However, many in Congress did take Tito&#x27;s speeches seriously, and reached the conclusion that Yugoslavia was an anti-Western nation, much to Kennan&#x27;s chagrin. Kennan argued that since Tito wanted Yugoslavia to be neutral in the Cold War, that there was no point in expecting Yugoslavia to align itself with the West, but Yugoslav neutrality did serve American interests as it ensured that Yugoslavia&#x27;s powerful army was not at the disposal of the Soviets and the Soviet Union had no air or naval bases in Yugoslavia that could be used to threaten Italy and Greece, both members of NATO. More importantly, Kennan noted that Yugoslavia&#x27;s policy of &quot;market socialism&quot; gave it a higher standard of living than elsewhere in Eastern Europe, that there was greater freedom of expression there than in other Communist nations, and the very existence of a Communist nation in Eastern Europe that was not under the control of the Kremlin was very destabilizing to the Soviet bloc as it inspired other communist leaders with the desire for greater independence. With U.S.–Yugoslav relations getting progressively worse, Kennan tendered his resignation as ambassador during late July 1963.

== Academic career and later life ==
In 1957 Kennan was invited by the BBC to give the annual Reith Lectures, a series of six radio lectures which were titled &quot;Russia, the Atom and the West&quot;. These covered the history, effect, and possible consequences of relations between Russia and the West.

After the end of his brief ambassadorial post in Yugoslavia during 1963, Kennan spent the rest of his life in academe, becoming a major realist critic of U.S. foreign policy. Having spent 18 months as a scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) between 1950 and 1952, Kennan joined the faculty of the institute&#x27;s School of Historical Studies in 1956, and spent the rest of his life there.

===Opposition to the Vietnam War===
During the 1960s, Kennan criticized U.S. involvement in Vietnam, arguing that the United States had little vital interest in the region. In February 1966, Kennan testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the request of the committee&#x27;s chairman, Senator J. William Fulbright, where he stated that the &quot;preoccupation&quot; with Vietnam was undermining U.S. global leadership. He accused the administration of Lyndon Johnson of distorting his policies into a purely military approach. President Johnson was so annoyed by the hearings called by his friend-turned-foe Fulbright that he tried to upstage them by holding a sudden and unannounced summit in Honolulu starting on 5 February 1966 with Chief of State Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and Prime Minister Nguyễn Cao Kỳ of South Vietnam, where he declared that the United States was making excellent progress in Vietnam and was committed to social and economic reforms.

Kennan testified that were the United States not already fighting in Vietnam that: &quot;I would know of no reason why we should wish to become so involved, and I could think of several reasons why we should wish not to&quot;. He was opposed to an immediate pull-out from Vietnam, saying &quot;A precipitate and disorderly withdrawal could represent in present circumstances a disservice to our own interests, and even to world peace&quot;, but added that he felt &quot;there is more respect to be won in the opinion of this world by a resolute and courageous liquidation of unsound positions than by the most stubborn pursuit of extravagant and unpromising objectives.&quot; In his testimony, Kennan argued that Ho Chi Minh was &quot;not Hitler&quot; and everything he had read about him suggested that Ho was a Communist, but also a Vietnamese nationalist who did not want his country to be subservient to either the Soviet Union or China. He further testified that to defeat North Vietnam would mean a cost in human life &quot;for which I would not like to see this country be responsible for&quot;. Kennan compared the Johnson administration&#x27;s policy towards Vietnam as being like that of &quot;an elephant frightened by a mouse&quot;.

Kennan ended his testimony by quoting a remark made by John Quincy Adams: &quot;America goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.&quot; Kennan then stated: &quot;Now, gentlemen, I don&#x27;t know exactly what John Quincy Adams had in mind when he spoke those words. But I think that, without knowing it, he spoke very directly and very pertinently to us here today.&quot; The hearings were aired live on television (at the time a rare occurrence), and Kennan&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;Father of Containment&quot; ensured that his testimony attracted much media attention, all the more so as the Johnson administration professed to be carrying out in Vietnam &quot;containment&quot; policies. Thus Johnson pressured the main television networks not to air Kennan&#x27;s testimony, and as a result, the CBS network aired reruns of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; while Kennan was before the Senate, provoking the CBS director of television programming, Fred Friendly, to resign in protest . By contrast, the NBC network resisted the presidential pressure and did air the proceedings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. To counter Kennan&#x27;s testimony, Johnson sent Secretary of State Dean Rusk before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where he testified that the war in Vietnam was a morally just struggle to stop &quot;...the steady extension of Communist power through force and threat.&quot;

Despite expectations, Kennan&#x27;s testimony before the Senate attracted high ratings on television. Kennan himself recalled that in the month afterward he received a flood of letters, which led him to write about the public response: &quot;It was perfectly tremendous. I haven&#x27;t expected anything remotely like this.&quot; The columnist Art Buchwald described being stunned to see that his wife and her friends had spent the day watching Kennan testify instead of the standard soap operas, saying that he did not realize that American housewives were interested in such matters. Fulbright&#x27;s biographer wrote that testimony of Kennan together with General James Gavin was important because they were not &quot;irresponsible students or a wild-eyed radicals,&quot; which made it possible for &quot;respectable people&quot; to oppose the Vietnam War. Kennan&#x27;s testimony in February 1966 was the most successful of his various bids to influence public opinion after leaving the State Department. Before he appeared before the Senate, 63% of the American public approved of Johnson&#x27;s handling of the Vietnam War; after his testimony, 49% did.

===Critic of the counterculture===
Kennan&#x27;s opposition to the Vietnam War did not mean any sympathy for the student protests against the Vietnam War. In his 1968 book &quot;Democracy and the Student Left&quot;, Kennan attacked the left-wing university students demonstrating against the Vietnam War as violent and intolerant. Kennan compared the &quot;New Left&quot; students of the 1960s with the &quot;Narodnik&quot; student radicals of 19th century Russia, accusing both of being an arrogant group of elitists whose ideas were fundamentally undemocratic and dangerous. Kennan wrote that most of the demands of the student radicals were &quot;gobbledygook&quot; and he charged that their political style was marked by a complete lack of humor, extremist tendencies and mindless destructive urges. Kennan conceded that the student radicals were right to oppose the Vietnam War, but he complained that they were confusing policy with institutions as he argued that just because an institution executed a misguided policy did not make it evil and worthy of destruction.

Kennan blamed the student radicalism of the late 1960s on what he called the &quot;sickly secularism&quot; of American life, which he charged was too materialistic and shallow to allow understanding of the &quot;slow powerful process of organic growth&quot; which had made America great. Kennan wrote that what he regarded as the spiritual malaise of America had created a generation of young Americans with an &quot;extreme disbalance in emotional and intellectual growth.&quot; Kennan ended his book with a lament that the America of his youth no longer existed as he complained that most Americans were seduced by advertising into a consumerist lifestyle that left them indifferent to the environmental degradation all around them and to the gross corruption of their politicians. Kennan argued that he was the real radical as: &quot;They haven&#x27;t seen anything yet. Not only do my apprehensions outclass theirs, but my ideas of what would have to be done to put things right are far more radical than theirs.&quot;

In a speech delivered in Williamsburg on 1 June 1968, Kennan criticized the authorities for an &quot;excess of tolerance&quot; in dealing with student protests and rioting by Afro-Americans. Kennan called for the suppression of the New Left and Black Power movements in a way that would be &quot;answerable to the voters only at the next election, but not to the press or even the courts&quot;. Kennan argued for &quot;special political courts&quot; be created to try New Left and Black Power activists as he stated that this was the only way to save the United States from chaos. At the same time, Kennan stated that based upon his visits to South Africa: &quot;I have a soft spot in my mind for &quot;apartheid&quot;, not as practiced in South Africa, but as a concept.&quot; Although Kennan disliked the petty, humiliating aspects of &quot;apartheid&quot;, he had much praise for the &quot;deep religious sincerity&quot; of the Afrikaners whose Calvinist faith he shared while he dismissed the capacity of South African blacks to run their country. Kennan argued in 1968 that a system similar to &quot;apartheid&quot; was needed for the United States as he doubted the ability of average black American male to operate &quot;in a system he neither understands nor respects,&quot; leading him to advocate the Bantustans of South Africa to be used as a model with areas of the United States to be set aside for Afro-Americans. Kennan did not approve of the social changes of the 1960s. During a visit to Denmark in 1970, he came across a youth festival, which he described with disgust as &quot;swarming with hippies—motorbikes, girl-friends, drugs, pornography, drunkenness, noise. I looked at this mob and thought how one company of robust Russian infantry would drive it out of town.&quot;

===Establishment of Kennan Institute===
Always a student of Russian affairs Kennan, together with Wilson Center Director James Billington and historian S. Frederick Starr, initiated the establishment of the Kennan Institute at the academic institution named for Woodrow Wilson. The institute is named to honour the American George Kennan, a scholar of the Russian Empire, and a relation of the subject of this article. Scholars at the Institute are meant to study Russia, Ukraine and the Eurasian region.

=== Critic of the arms race ===
Containment, when he published the first volume of his memoirs in 1967, involved something other than the use of military &quot;counterforce&quot;. He was never pleased that the policy he influenced was associated with the arms build-up of the Cold War. In his memoirs, Kennan argued that containment did not demand a militarized U.S. foreign policy. &quot;Counterforce&quot; implied the political and economic defense of Western Europe against the disruptive effect of the war on European society. According to him, the Soviet Union exhausted by war posed no serious military threat to the US or its allies at the beginning of the Cold War but was rather an ideological and political rival. Kennan believed that the USSR, Britain, Germany, Japan, and North America remained the areas of vital U.S. interests. During the 1970s and 1980s, as détente was ended particularly under President Reagan, he was a major critic of the renewed arms race.

=== Politics of silence ===
In 1989, President George H. W. Bush awarded Kennan the Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s greatest civilian honor. Yet he remained a realist critic of recent U.S. presidents, urging in a 1999 interview with the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; the U.S. government to &quot;withdraw from its public advocacy of democracy and human rights,&quot; saying that the &quot;tendency to see ourselves as the center of political enlightenment and as teachers to a great part of the rest of the world strikes me as unthought-through, vainglorious and undesirable&quot;.

=== Opposition to NATO enlargement ===
A key inspiration for American containment policies during the Cold War, Kennan would later describe NATO&#x27;s enlargement as a &quot;strategic blunder of potentially epic proportions&quot;. Kennan opposed the Clinton administration&#x27;s war in Kosovo and its expansion of NATO (the establishment of which he had also opposed half a century earlier), expressing fears that both policies would worsen relations with Russia.

During a 1998 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; after the U.S. Senate had just ratified NATO&#x27;s first round of expansion, he said &quot;there was no reason for this whatsoever&quot;. He was concerned that it would &quot;inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic&quot; opinions in Russia. &quot;The Russians will gradually react quite adversely and it will affect their policies,&quot; he said. Kennan was also bothered by talks that Russia was &quot;dying to attack Western Europe&quot;, explaining that, on the contrary, the Russian people had revolted to &quot;remove that Soviet regime&quot; and that their &quot;democracy was as far advanced&quot; as the other countries that had just signed up for NATO then.

===Last years===
Kennan remained vigorous and alert during the last years of his life, although arthritis had him using a wheelchair. During his later years, Kennan concluded that &quot;the general effect of Cold War extremism was to delay rather than hasten the great change that overtook the Soviet Union&quot;. At age 98, he warned of the unforeseen consequences of waging war against Iraq. He warned that attacking Iraq would amount to waging a second war that &quot;bears no relation to the first war against terrorism&quot; and declared efforts by the Bush administration to associate Al-Qaeda with Saddam Hussein &quot;pathetically unsupportive and unreliable&quot;. Kennan went on to warn:

In his final years, Kennan embraced the ideals of the Second Vermont Republic, a secessionist movement incorporated in 2003. Noting the large-scale Mexican immigration to the Southwestern United States, Kennan said in 2002 there were &quot;unmistakable evidences of a growing differentiation between the cultures, respectively, of large southern and southwestern regions of this country, on the one hand&quot;, and those of &quot;some northern regions&quot;. In the former, &quot;the very culture of the bulk of the population of these regions will tend to be primarily Latin American in nature rather than what is inherited from earlier American traditions ... Could it really be that there was so little of merit [in America] that it deserves to be recklessly trashed in favor of a polyglot mix-mash?&quot; It&#x27;s argued that Kennan represented throughout his career the &quot;tradition of militant nativism&quot; that resembled or even exceeded the Know Nothings of the 1850s. Kennan also believed American women had too much power.

In February 2004 scholars, diplomats, and Princeton alumni gathered at the university&#x27;s campus to celebrate Kennan&#x27;s 100th birthday. Among those in attendance were Secretary of State Colin Powell, international relations theorist John Mearsheimer, journalist Chris Hedges, former ambassador and career Foreign Service officer Jack F. Matlock, Jr., and Kennan&#x27;s biographer, John Lewis Gaddis.

Kennan died on March 17, 2005, at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, aged 101. He was survived by his Norwegian wife Annelise, whom he married in 1931, and his four children, eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. Annelise died in 2008 at the age of 98.

In an obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Kennan was described as &quot;the American diplomat who did more than any other envoy of his generation to shape United States policy during the cold war&quot; to whom &quot;the White House and the Pentagon turned when they sought to understand the Soviet Union after World War II&quot;. Of Kennan, historian Wilson D. Miscamble remarked &quot;[o]ne can only hope that present and future makers of foreign policy might share something of his integrity and intelligence&quot;. &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; described Kennan as &quot;the most influential diplomat of the 20th century&quot;. Henry Kissinger said that Kennan &quot;came as close to authoring the diplomatic doctrine of his era as any diplomat in our history&quot;, while Colin Powell called Kennan &quot;our best tutor&quot; in dealing with the foreign policy issues of the 21st century.

== Published works ==
During his career at the IAS, Kennan wrote seventeen books and scores of articles on international relations. He won the Pulitzer Prize for History, the National Book Award for Nonfiction, the Bancroft Prize, and the Francis Parkman Prize for &quot;Russia Leaves the War&quot;, published in 1956. He again won a Pulitzer and a National Book Award in 1968 for &quot;Memoirs, 1925–1950&quot;. A second volume, taking his reminiscences up to 1963 was published in 1972. Among his other works were &quot;American Diplomacy 1900–1950&quot;, &quot;Sketches from a Life&quot;, published in 1989, and &quot;Around the Cragged Hill&quot; in 1993.

His properly historical works amount to a six-volume account of the relations between Russia and the West from 1875 to his own time; the period from 1894 to 1914 was planned but not completed. He was chiefly concerned with:
* The folly of the First World War as a choice of policy; he argues that the costs of modern war, direct and indirect, predictably exceeded the benefits of eliminating the Hohenzollerns.
* The ineffectiveness of summit diplomacy, with the Conference of Versailles as a type-case. National leaders have too much to do to give any single matter the constant and flexible attention which diplomatic problems require.
* The Allied intervention in Russia in 1918–19. He was indignant with Soviet accounts of a vast capitalist conspiracy against the world&#x27;s first worker&#x27;s state, some of which do not even mention the First World War; he was equally indignant with the decision to intervene as costly and harmful. He argues that the interventions, by arousing Russian nationalism, may have ensured the survival of the Bolshevik state.

Kennan had a low opinion of President Roosevelt, arguing in 1975: &quot;For all his charm, political skill, and able wartime leadership, when it came to foreign policy Roosevelt was a superficial, ignorant dilettante, a man with a severely limited intellectual horizon.&quot;

==Awards, honors and legacy==
During his career, Kennan received a number of awards and honors. As a scholar and writer, Kennan was a two-time recipient of both the Pulitzer Prizes and the National Book Award, and had also received the Francis Parkman Prize, the Ambassador Book Award and the Bancroft Prize.

Among Kennan&#x27;s numerous other awards and distinctions were his election to both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1952), the Testimonial of Loyal and Meritorious Service from the Department of State (1953), Princeton&#x27;s Woodrow Wilson Award for Distinguished Achievement in the Nation&#x27;s Service (1976), the Order of the Pour le Mérite (1976), the Albert Einstein Peace Prize (1981), the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade (1982), the American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal (1984), the American Whig-Cliosophic Society&#x27;s James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service(1985), the Franklin D. Roosevelt Foundation Freedom from Fear Medal (1987), the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1989), the Distinguished Service Award from the Department of State (1994), and the Library of Congress Living Legend (2000).

Kennan had also received 29 honorary degrees and was honored in his name with the George F. Kennan Chair in National Security Strategy at the National War College and the George F. Kennan Professorship at the Institute for Advanced Study.

In June 2022, a memorial plaque honoring Kennan was unveiled in Belgrade, Serbia at the site of the former U.S. embassy. Kennan had served in the country when it was part of Yugoslavia, from 1961 to 1963.

==Academic criticism==
Russell argues that a school of thought known as political realism formed the basis of Kennan&#x27;s work as a diplomat and historian and remains relevant to the debate over American foreign policy, which since the 19th century has been characterized by a shift from the Founding Fathers&#x27; realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations. According to the realist tradition, security is based on the principle of a balance of power, whereas Wilsonianism (considered impractical by realists) relies on morality as the sole determining factor in statecraft. According to the Wilsonians the spread of democracy abroad as a foreign policy is important and morals are valid universally. During the Presidency of Bill Clinton, American diplomacy represented the Wilsonian school to such a degree that those instead in favor of realism likened President Clinton&#x27;s policies to social work. According to Kennan, whose concept of American diplomacy was based on the realist approach, such moralism without regard to the realities of power and the national interest is self-defeating and will result in the decrease of American power.

In his historical writings and memoirs, Kennan laments in great detail the failings of democratic foreign policy makers and those of the United States in particular. According to Kennan, when American policymakers suddenly confronted the Cold War, they had inherited little more than rationale and rhetoric &quot;utopian in expectations, legalistic in concept, moralistic in [the] demand it seemed to place on others, and self-righteous in the degree of high-mindedness and rectitude  ... to ourselves&quot;. The source of the problem is the force of public opinion, a force that is inevitably unstable, unserious, subjective, emotional, and simplistic. Kennan has insisted that the U.S. public can only be united behind a foreign policy goal on the &quot;primitive level of slogans and jingoistic ideological inspiration&quot;.

Miscamble argues that Kennan played a critical role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan did not hold a vision for either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the balance of power between the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble concedes that although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.

<text>The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (New Mexico Tech or NMT), formerly New Mexico School of Mines, is a public university in Socorro, New Mexico, United States.

It offers over 30 bachelor of science degrees in technology, the sciences, engineering, management, and technical communication, as well as graduate degrees at the masters and doctoral levels.

== History ==
With 1,244 undergraduate students as of 2021, New Mexico Tech is a relatively small university focused on science and engineering. It was founded by the New Mexico Territorial Legislature in 1889 as the New Mexico School of Mines, with the goal of boosting the territorial economy by teaching mining specialties at the college level. 

During the 1930s, petroleum engineering and technology also became an important field of study at the institute. In 1946, New Mexico Tech began offering graduate degrees. The institute adopted its current name in 1951, but the change was not legally effective until 1960, through an amendment of the New Mexico State Constitution, Art. XII, Section 11.

==Research and teaching==

New Mexico Tech&#x27;s well-known areas of research and teaching include hydrology, astrophysics, atmospheric physics, geophysics, information technology, information security, Earth Science, energetic materials engineering, and petroleum recovery.

In 2003, with funds from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, New Mexico Tech purchased the town of Playas, New Mexico, and the surrounding to develop the Playas Training and Research Center, operated by the school&#x27;s EMRTC, which provides training and research for the university&#x27;s first responders, counterterrorism, and Air Force programs.

===Affiliated science and engineering centers===
* New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources
* Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center
* Institute for Complex Additive Systems Analysis
* The EarthScope Primary Instrument Center (EPIC, formerly the IRIS PASSCAL Instrument Center)
* Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research
* Magdalena Ridge Observatory
* National Cave and Karst Research Institute
* National Radio Astronomy Observatory (a National Science Foundation facility operated by Associated Universities, Inc. located on the New Mexico Tech campus)
* Petroleum Recovery Research Center
* Playas Training and Research Center

==Student life==

NMT hosts an annual Performing Arts Series that is free to students, and, along with the broader Socorro community, city, and county, supports a great number of special events each year. New Mexico Tech is located approximately an hour south of Albuquerque in a region of high deserts to subalpine mountains that offers considerable outdoor recreation opportunities, including rock climbing, road and mountain biking, a triathlon, and hiking opportunities. New Mexico Tech also hosts numerous active student clubs, a Part 15 AM radio station, and a biweekly student newspaper, &quot;Paydirt&quot;. The campus includes an 18-hole championship golf course.

The campus population has historically been predominantly male, but it has moved increasingly towards a balance between the sexes. The gender distribution at New Mexico Tech is 68% male and 32% female.

<doc id="386031" wikidata="Q6086323" url="?curid=386031" title="Isospectral">
<text>In mathematics, two linear operators are called isospectral or cospectral if they have the same spectrum. Roughly speaking, they are supposed to have the same sets of eigenvalues, when those are counted with multiplicity.

The theory of isospectral operators is markedly different depending on whether the space is finite or infinite dimensional. In finite-dimensions, one essentially deals with square matrices.

In infinite dimensions, the spectrum need not consist solely of isolated eigenvalues. However, the case of a compact operator on a Hilbert space (or Banach space) is still tractable, since the eigenvalues are at most countable with at most a single limit point &quot;λ&quot; = 0. The most studied isospectral problem in infinite dimensions is that of the Laplace operator on a domain in R2. Two such domains are called isospectral if their Laplacians are isospectral. The problem of inferring the geometrical properties of a domain from the spectrum of its Laplacian is often known as hearing the shape of a drum.

==Finite dimensional spaces==

In the case of operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces, for complex square matrices, the relation of being isospectral for two diagonalizable matrices is just similarity. This doesn&#x27;t however reduce completely the interest of the concept, since we can have an isospectral family of matrices of shape &quot;A&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;M&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)−1&quot;AM&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) depending on a parameter &quot;t&quot; in a complicated way. This is an evolution of a matrix that happens inside one similarity class.

A fundamental insight in soliton theory was that the infinitesimal analogue of that equation, namely

:&quot;A&quot; = [&quot;A&quot;, &quot;M&quot;] = &quot;AM&quot; − &quot;MA&quot;

was behind the conservation laws that were responsible for keeping solitons from dissipating. That is, the preservation of spectrum was an interpretation of the conservation mechanism. The identification of so-called Lax pairs (P,L) giving rise to analogous equations, by Peter Lax, showed how linear machinery could explain the non-linear behaviour.

== Isospectral manifolds ==

Two closed Riemannian manifolds are said to be isospectral if the eigenvalues of their Laplace–Beltrami operator (Laplacians), counted multiplicities, coincide. One of fundamental problems in spectral geometry is to ask to what extent the eigenvalues determine the geometry of a given manifold.

There are many examples of isospectral manifolds which are not isometric. The first example was given in 1964 by John Milnor. He constructed a pair of flat tori of 16 dimension, using arithmetic lattices first studied by Ernst Witt. After this example, many isospectral pairs in dimension two and higher were constructed (for instance, by M. F. Vignéras, A. Ikeda, H. Urakawa, C. Gordon). In particular , based on the Selberg trace formula for PSL(2,R) and PSL(2,C), constructed examples of isospectral, non-isometric closed hyperbolic 2-manifolds and 3-manifolds as quotients of hyperbolic 2-space and 3-space by arithmetic subgroups, constructed using quaternion algebras associated with quadratic extensions of the rationals by class field theory. In this case Selberg&#x27;s trace formula shows that the spectrum of the Laplacian fully determines the &quot;length spectrum&quot;, the set of lengths of closed geodesics in each free homotopy class, along with the twist along the geodesic in the 3-dimensional case.

In 1985 Toshikazu Sunada found a general method of construction based on a covering space technique, which, either in its original or certain generalized versions, came to be known as the Sunada method or Sunada construction. Like the previous methods it is based on the trace formula, via the Selberg zeta function. Sunada noticed that the method of constructing number fields with the same Dedekind zeta function could be adapted to compact manifolds. His method relies on the fact that if &quot;M&quot; is a finite covering of a compact Riemannian manifold
&quot;M&quot;0 with &quot;G&quot; the finite group of deck transformations and &quot;H&quot;1, &quot;H&quot;2 are subgroups of &quot;G&quot; meeting each conjugacy class of &quot;G&quot; in the same number of elements, then the manifolds &quot;H&quot;1 \ &quot;M&quot; and &quot;H&quot;2 \ &quot;M&quot; are isospectral
but not necessarily isometric. Although this does not recapture the arithmetic examples of Milnor and Vignéras, Sunada&#x27;s method yields many known examples of isospectral manifolds. It led C. Gordon, D. Webb and S. Wolpert to the discovery in 1991 of a counter example to Mark Kac&#x27;s problem &quot;Can one hear the shape of a drum?&quot; An elementary treatment, based on Sunada&#x27;s method, was later given in .

Sunada&#x27;s idea also stimulated the attempt to find isospectral examples which could not be obtained by his technique. Among many examples, the most striking one is a simply connected example of . On the other hand, Alan Reid proved that certain isospectral arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds in are commensurable.

<text>New World orioles are a group of birds in the genus Icterus of the blackbird family. Although they are not closely related to Old World orioles of the family Oriolidae, they are strikingly similar in size, diet, behavior, and strongly contrasting plumage. As a result, the two have been given the same vernacular name.

Males are typically black and vibrant yellow or orange with white markings, females and immature birds duller. They molt annually. New World orioles are generally slender with long tails and a pointed bill. They mainly eat insects, but also enjoy nectar and fruit. The nest is a woven, elongated pouch. Species nesting in areas with cold winters are strongly migratory, while subtropical and tropical species are more sedentary.

The name &quot;oriole&quot; was first recorded (in the Latin form &quot;oriolus&quot;) by the German Dominican friar Albertus Magnus in about 1250, which he stated to be onomatopoeic, from the song of the European golden oriole.

One of the species in the genus, Bahama oriole, is considered endangered, formerly critically endangered, by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The genus &quot;Icterus&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the Venezuelan troupial as the type species. The name is the Latin word for a yellow bird, probably the Eurasian golden oriole.

The genus name &quot;Icterus,&quot; as used by classical authors, referred to a bird with yellow or green plumage. &quot;Icterus&quot; is from Greek ἴκτερος (&quot;íkteros&quot;, “jaundice”); the &quot;ictērus&quot; was a bird the sight of which was believed to cure jaundice, perhaps the Eurasian golden oriole. Brisson re-applied the name to the New World birds because of their similarity in appearance.

==Species list==
The genus contains 32 extant species.

One extinct species, the Talara troupial (&quot;Icterus turmalis&quot;), is known from fossil remains recovered from the Talara Tar Seeps of northwestern Peru, and likely went extinct during the late Quaternary. It may have been a close associate of Pleistocene megafauna communities, and may have gone extinct following their collapse in populations.

<doc id="386053" wikidata="Q17004785" url="?curid=386053" title="Holiness Baptist Association">
<text>The Holiness Baptist Association is a Holiness Pentecostal body of Christians with Baptist historical roots.

==Holiness movement==
In 19th century America, the Holiness movement developed out of the Methodist emphasis of the Wesleyan teachings of holiness. John Wesley taught that holiness (also known as entire sanctification or Christian perfection), was a definite and instantaneous second work of grace received by faith. Methodists, inclusive of the holiness movement, equated entire sanctification with baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Early in the 20th century, some in the Holiness movement also embraced Pentecostalism, which taught a third work of grace, whose outward sign was speaking in tongues. Holiness Pentecostals taught that it was the third work of grace, not the second work of grace, that was the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Those in the holiness movement (such as the Free Methodist Church and Church of the Nazarene) were critical of the Holiness Pentecostals for this reason and rejected the Parhamian-Seymourian doctrine of speaking in tongues. The following bodies have primary roots in the Holiness movement and secondary roots in Pentecostalism.

==Holiness Baptists in Georgia==
The holiness movement among Baptists in south Georgia began late in the 19th century in Wilcox County among ministers in the Little River Baptist Association. At the annual session of the association in 1893, fellowship was withdrawn from two churches &quot;because of their doctrine of holiness or carnal perfection&quot;.¹ The two excluded churches and two newly formed churches met in 1894 to organize the &quot;Holiness Baptist Association&quot;. The association was organized upon the same articles of faith and rules of decorum as the Little River Association. In 1905, the association adopted new articles of faith and decorum, bringing their statements in line with their holiness beliefs. More changes were made to the articles and decorum in 1916. They have since remained relatively the same. In 1916, the Holiness Baptists agreed to form two separate associations, and continued in that manner until they consolidated in 1925. A periodical called &quot;The Gospel Standard&quot; was started in 1918 by J. N. Salter, and has continued as the &quot;Holiness Baptist Association&quot; publication to the present. Over the years the Holiness Baptists of Georgia moved away from Baptist polity, proceeding through a Presbyterian form to a Methodist form of government, while gradually including Pentecostal distinctives, such as speaking in tongues, within their services. Their greatest period of growth was from 1905 to 1945, after which they began to decline. In 1949, the association built a camp ground and tabernacle in Coffee County near Douglas, Georgia. Annual meetings of the association are held at the tabernacle. There is one member church in Florida.

In 1934, the Baptist Purity Association was formed by members excluded from the &quot;Holiness Baptist Association&quot; for teaching and practicing the substitution of water for grape juice in the Lord&#x27;s supper.

In 1977, discontented members withdrew and formed the Calvary Holiness Association.

According to historian Robert G. Gardner of Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, these three Holiness Baptist bodies currently have about 50 churches with about 1,582 members. Like many other Holiness groups, they maintain strict standards of dress, require long hair for women and short hair for men, and abstain from tobacco, intoxicating beverages, dancing provocatively, gambling, television, etc.

== Holiness Baptist Churches of Southwestern Arkansas ==
William Jethro Walthall (1858–1931) was ordained as a Missionary Baptist preacher on May 29, 1887. In 1895 he became familiar with the holiness revival, and felt it spoke to what he believed he had already experienced. These teachings were at odds with the local Baptist teachings. Walthall was excluded from his church in 1896 and ostracized by the Red River Baptist Association. In 1899, minister J. C. Kelly and his church were excluded from the Red River Association. Walthall and Kelly continued to preach and formed new churches, mostly in southwestern Arkansas, but a few in Oklahoma Territory and Texas. By 1903 these churches had founded the &quot;Holiness Baptist Churches of Southwestern Arkansas&quot;. The first annual session was held November 6–8, 1903 at Sutton, Arkansas. This Holiness Baptist group continued until 1917. In that year, Walthall joined the Assemblies of God and brought all 36 congregations of the &quot;Holiness Baptist Churches of Southwestern Arkansas&quot; into the Assemblies of God.

== North Carolina and South Carolina ==
Early in the 19th century, Holiness Baptist churches at Greenville, South Carolina and Hendersonville, North Carolina corresponded with the &quot;Holiness Baptist Association of Georgia&quot;. A church at Burlington, North Carolina was a member of the Georgia association for a few years. The status of these churches is unknown, though they likely were absorbed into other holiness or Pentecostal bodies.

== Kentucky and Tennessee ==
The Church of God Mountain Assembly, though not named &quot;Holiness Baptist&quot;, began as a holiness movement among Baptists. It was formed in 1907 by ministers and churches excluded from the &quot;South Union Association of United Baptists&quot; for preaching holiness and the danger of apostasy. The &quot;Church of God Mountain Assembly&quot; corresponded with the &quot;Holiness Baptist Association of Georgia&quot; early in the 20th century.

<text>The boreal owl (Aegolius funereus) or Tengmalm&#x27;s owl is a small owl in the &quot;true owl&quot; family Strigidae. It is known as the boreal owl in North America and as Tengmalm&#x27;s owl in Europe after Swedish naturalist Peter Gustaf Tengmalm or, more rarely, Richardson&#x27;s owl after Sir John Richardson.

Due to the boreal owl&#x27;s shyness and evasive reaction to human activities, nocturnal habits and preferred inaccessible taiga forest habitat, it is rarely seen by humans.

==Taxonomy==
The boreal owl was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Linnaeus placed it with all the other owls in the genus &quot;Strix&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Strix funerea&quot;. The Eurasian scops owl is now placed in the genus &quot;Aegolius&quot; that was introduced in 1829 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup with the boreal owl as the type species. The genus name is Latin for a screech owl, the word came from the Ancient Greek &quot;aigōlios&quot; meaning &quot;a bird of ill omen&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;funereus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;funereal&quot;.

=== Related species ===
Congeners include northern saw-whet owl (&quot;A. acadicus&quot;), unspotted saw-whet owl (&quot;A. ridgwayi&quot;), and buff-fronted owl (&quot;A. harrisii&quot;), all found in the New World.

=== Subspecies ===
Seven subspecies are recognized: 
*&quot;A.f. richardsoni&quot; (Bonaparte, 1838) – Alaska, north Canada and north United States
*&quot;A.f funereus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – nominate subspecies, from Scandinavia down south to the Pyrenees and east to the Urals, but not the Caucasus Mountains
*&quot;A.f. magnus&quot; (Buturlin, 1907) – northeast Siberia
*&quot;A.f. sibiricus&quot; (Buturlin, 1910) – southeast and south Siberia
*&quot;A.f. pallens&quot; (Schalow, 1908) – west and central Siberia
*&quot;A.f. caucasicus&quot; (Buturlin, 1907) – Caucasus Mountains
*&quot;A.f. beickianus&quot; Stresemann, 1928 – northwest India to southwest China

=== Fossil History ===
Remains of the boreal owl dating back to the Pleistocene era were found in a cave in southern New Mexico. Bones were found in a pueblo in north-central New Mexico that has been inhabited from around A.D. 1250 to the present.

==Description==
The boreal owl is small with a large head and long wings. Both sexes are similar in appearance, though females are larger. Males typically measure 21–25 cm (8.3-9.8 in) in length, with a wingspan of 55–58 cm (21.7-22.8 in), while females are larger – 25–28 cm (9.8–11 in) – with a wingspan of 59–62 cm (23.2-24.4 in). A female is heavier than a male bird and weighs 132-215 g (4.7-7.6 oz) compared to 93-139 g (3.3-4.9 oz) for a male bird.

=== Adult identification ===
The plumage is brown above, with white flecking on the shoulders and whitish underparts with rust-colored streaks. Its large head has yellow eyes and an olive-brown crown with small white droplets and larger central spots. The dull white facial disc is framed with a dark border and white “eyebrows” often described as giving the owl a &quot;surprised&quot; expression. The underparts are cream-white with russet-brown streaks, while the tail has olive-brown feathers with narrow bars. Flight feathers are dark olive-brown with contrasting white spots. The primaries typically have up to five rows of white spots, while the tail has three distinct rows of spots. Unlike other owl species, these spots remain separated even when the tail is folded closely together. The beak is light yellow, rather than dark like its relative the northern saw-whet owl. The ears are asymmetrical in multiple bones, which enhances their hunting success. The boreal owl&#x27;s flight is relatively noiseless and straight.

=== Juvenile identification ===

Juvenile boreal owls, at about 3 weeks old, have a completely dull, chocolate-brown upperparts and underparts, with a dark brown facial disc bordered by black and white markings near the bill. Upon fledging, their plumage remains similar but with white markings on the neck, scapulars, flight feathers, and tail. They develop a broad white &quot;X&quot; between the eyes and distinct white streaks along the face, with cream-colored belly and flanks streaked in dark gray-brown.

=== Moults ===
Boreal Owls have two primary moulting phases. The Prebasic I molt occurs around the age of two months, between August and September. It only affects the head, body, and wing coverts. The flight feathers, tertials, greater primary coverts, and tail are unaffected. The Definitive Prebasic molt is also partial, affecting all of the head, body, and wing coverts, as well as the tail, but only a portion of the flight feathers, which are replaced in a specific order each year. Males in Idaho moult from June to October, while females do so from May to October.

=== Vocalizations ===
Vocalizations and related functions can be challenging to interpret because of their nocturnal and evasive lifestyle. Starting at one week old, young owls produce a harsh &quot;peep&quot; or &quot;chirp&quot; that softens after fledging. Comprehensive studies in North America has found 8 different types of vocalizations that play an important role in communication, mating, and territorial behaviour:

* The Primary Song - loud trill sung by males to attract females and establish territory 
* The Prolonged Song - softer courtship melody sung by males from beginning of courtship to incubation to strengthen bonds
* The Delivery Call - soft call by male to signal the transfer of prey to a female or young 
* The Screech - a load contact call made while flying or from a perch 
* The Peeping Call - soft vocalization by females throughout breeding to respond to males&#x27; calls
* The Weak Call - single note repeated rapidly from females in nest after hatching 
* The Chuuk Call - harsh response call by females on male&#x27;s territory 
* The Hiss Call - defensive call by females when the nest is disturbed

Bill clapping is used as a protective sound by both adults and juveniles, and is frequently associated with vocal hiss. Young develop bill clapping at least one week before fledging. Adults reply with a bill clap when humans handle them or enter the nest cavity.

Calls are similar in sound to the &quot;winnowing&quot; of the North American Wilson&#x27;s snipe.

==Distribution and habitat==
The boreal owl breeds in dense boreal, subalpine forest as well as mixed woodland. The preferred habitats are old-growth forests as they provide shelter from avian predators and an abundant number of preys. Breeding habitats include boreal forests of black and white spruce, birch and aspen across northern North America and the Palearctic, and in mountain ranges such as the Alps and the Rockies. Nests can be found in aspen and mixed forests, while individuals roost in conifers of about 6 meters high. This species can travel long distances but are known to breed within 500 meters of their natal sites. Males have a higher site fidelity than females and occupy stable year-long home ranges. However, northern populations may migrate south in response to snow depth and poor prey availability, but eventually return to their breeding grounds.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===

Boreal owls are monogamous and raise a single brood once they reach one year of age. The breeding begins with a lengthy courtship process where males sing for up to 102 days, starting from mid-February to mid-April, depending on environmental factors like prey availability and weather. The nest is usually a hole in a tree often made by a woodpecker, but the birds also readily use nest-boxes. Nesting period last for 28–36 days. The clutch is usually 3-7 eggs which are laid at 2-day intervals. They are glossy white and measure and weigh around . The eggs are incubated only by the female beginning with the second egg and incubation lasts on average 29 days for the first egg and 2.6 days less for the last one. They hatch asynchronously after 25–32 days. Females take care of the young and brood the nestlings for an average of 21 days. Food is brought by males during the first 3 weeks to the nest and female will tear apart the food for 2 weeks until young are able to eat unassisted. The young fledge after 28–36 days and become independent at 3 to 6 weeks outside the nest cavity. Breeding densities fluctuate based on prey availability, ranging from 0.6 to 26 nests per square kilometer across different regions.

=== Food and feeding behaviour ===
This small owl eats mainly voles and other mammals (such as mice, chipmunks, other squirrels, gophers, moles, shrews and bats), but also birds as well as small amphibians, insects (such as beetles) and other invertebrates. In North America, they have been observed preying on southern red-backed voles, western heather voles, jumping mice, northern pocket gophers and northern flying squirrels. Birds preyed upon include dark-eyed juncos, American robins and common redpolls. It is largely nocturnal, though in the northernmost parts of its range, it has to hunt during daylight because of the very short nights in summer. This species is a sit-and-wait predator meaning it does not pursue animals within 10 meters of its hunting perch. Their extreme asymmetrical skulls leads to sound localization in both horizontal and vertical directions and allow them to capture preys under snow and dense vegetation.

=== Threats ===

==== Biological resource use - timber harvest ====
Logging activities have a negative impact on prey availability, foraging efficiency and suitable nesting sites. Since the 1990s, significant population declines in northern Europe have been attributed to clear-cutting. Moreover, pesticides from agriculture and forestry effluents are damaging to the species&#x27; health. The slow forest succession in spruce-fir ecosystems disrupts the recovery of critical habitat which impacts the species&#x27; ability to thrive. The black woodpecker (&quot;Dryocopus martius&quot;) population decline in Eurasia has also led to a reduced number of nesting cavities.

==== Predation ====
Marten species (Martes spp.) and tawny owls (&quot;Strix aluco&quot;) are the predominant predators of boreal owl owlets and adult females at nest locations, with martens preying on 48% of Norwegian clutches. Other predators include pine squirrels (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;), cooper&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Astur cooperii)&quot;, northern Goshawk, great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus)&quot; and ural owl (&quot;Strix uralensis&quot;). Moreover, nuthatches (&quot;Sitta europaea&quot;) have been observed blocking the entrance of nests with mud, occasionally trapping females inside and starving them to death.

===Mortality===
Boreal owl mortality rates vary by region and age. In Idaho, adult annual survival rate was 46%, while in Finland, first-year males had a survival rate of 50%, and adult males 67%. Most fledgling males (78%) died before their first breeding attempt. Overall, adult survival ranges from 62% to 72% across studies. Moreover, the average lifespan of breeding males is 3.5 years, and can go up to 11 years. Banded boreal owls have been known to live up to 16 years.

== Conservation status ==
The current population trend is stable with 730,000 - 1,810,000 mature individuals: the species is currently listed under Least Concerned under CITES Appendix II, the EU Birds Directive Appendix I, and Raptors MOU Category 3. Nevertheless, the species&#x27; lifestyle makes it hard to monitor the decline in some subpopulations. The USDA Forest Service Regions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9 designated the species as a &quot;sensitive species&quot;. In Europe, systematic breeding surveys are being conducted in order to monitor its population status. Nest boxes are implemented to create suitable nesting sites and ensure reproductive success. The preservation of old-growth forests - with selective tree harvest to allow tree removal while maintaining suitable habitats - and protection black woodpeckers (&quot;Dryocopus martius&quot;), that provide nesting cavities, are mandatory for the species&#x27; long-term survival.

<text>Franklin&#x27;s gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan) is a small (length 12.6–14.2 in, 32–36 cm) gull. The genus name &quot;Leucophaeus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;leukos&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, and &quot;phaios&quot;, &quot;dusky&quot;. The specific &quot;pipixcan&quot; is a Nahuatl name for a type of gull. The English common name was given to commemorate the arctic explorer Sir John Franklin, who led an expedition in 1825 on which the type was collected.

==Description==
It breeds in central provinces of Canada and adjacent states of the northern United States. It is a migratory bird, wintering in Argentina, the Caribbean, Chile, and Peru.

The summer adult&#x27;s body is white and its back and wings are much darker grey than all other gulls of similar size except the larger laughing gull. The wings have black tips with an adjacent white band. The bill and legs are red. The black hood of the breeding adult is mostly lost in winter.

Young birds are similar to the adult but have less developed hoods and lack the white wing band. They take three years to reach maturity.

Measurements:

* Length: 12.6–14.2 in (32–36 cm)
* Weight: 8.1–10.6 oz (230–300 g)
* Wingspan: 33.5–37.4 in (85–95 cm)

==Distribution==
Although the bird is uncommon on the coasts of North America, it occurs as a rare vagrant to northwest Europe, south and west Africa, Australia and Japan, with a single record from Eilat, Israel, in 2011 (Smith 2011), and a single record from Larnaca, Cyprus, July 2006. At the beginning of 2017 has been observed also in Southern Romania, southeast Europe.

==Behaviour==
They are omnivores like most gulls, and they will scavenge as well as seeking suitable small prey. In the spring, on rivers such as the Bow River large groups will float with the current, sipping the emerging insect hatch. The behaviour includes floating through a particular stretch and returning repeatedly to the same section.

===Reproduction===
The birds breed in colonies near prairie lakes with the nest constructed on the ground, or sometimes floating. The two or three eggs are incubated for about three weeks.

==Naming==
The bird was named after the Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin, who led an 1823 expedition in which the first specimen of Franklin&#x27;s gull was taken.

== Status ==
This species has a wide distribution range and a large population which is currently increasing, and is therefore classified as &quot;Least Concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List.

Wetlands International estimated at 2018 the global population at 1,000,000-1,490,000 individuals.

<doc id="386062" wikidata="Q8154361" url="?curid=386062" title="Wishful thinking">
<text>Wishful thinking is the formation of beliefs based on what might be pleasing to imagine, rather than on evidence, rationality, or reality. It is a product of resolving conflicts between belief and desire. Methodologies to examine wishful thinking are diverse. Various disciplines and schools of thought examine related mechanisms such as neural circuitry, human cognition and emotion, types of bias, procrastination, motivation, optimism, attention and environment. This concept has been examined as a fallacy. It is related to the concept of wishful seeing.

Some psychologists believe that positive thinking is able to positively influence behavior and so bring about better results. This is called the &quot;Pygmalion effect&quot;. Christopher Booker discussed wishful thinking in terms of &quot;the fantasy cycle&quot;, which he described as &quot;a pattern that recurs in personal lives, in politics, in history – and in storytelling.&quot; He added: &quot;When we embark on a course of action which is unconsciously driven by wishful thinking, all may seem to go well for a time, in what may be called the &#x27;dream stage&#x27;. But because this make-believe can never be reconciled with reality, it leads to a &#x27;frustration stage&#x27; as things start to go wrong, prompting a more determined effort to keep the fantasy in being. As reality presses in, it leads to a &#x27;nightmare stage&#x27; as everything goes wrong, culminating in an &#x27;explosion into reality&#x27;, when the fantasy finally falls apart.&quot;

Studies have consistently shown that holding all else equal, subjects will have unrealistic optimism and predict positive outcomes to be more likely than negative outcomes. Research also suggests that under certain circumstances, such as when threat increases, a reverse phenomenon occurs.

==As a fallacy==
In addition to being a cognitive bias and a poor way of making decisions, wishful thinking is commonly held to be a specific informal fallacy in an argument when it is assumed that because we wish something to be true or false, it &quot;is&quot; actually true or false. This fallacy has the form &quot;I wish that P were true/false; therefore, P is true/false.&quot; Wishful thinking, if this were true, would rely upon appeals to emotion, and would also be a red herring.

Wishful thinking may cause blindness to unintended consequences.

==Wishful seeing==
Wishful seeing is the phenomenon in which a person&#x27;s internal state influences their visual perception. People have the tendency to believe that they perceive the world for what it is, but research suggests otherwise. Currently, there are two main types of wishful seeing based on where wishful seeing occurs—in categorization of objects or in representations of an environment.

The concept of wishful seeing was first introduced by the New Look approach to psychology. The New Look approach was popularized in the 1950s through the work of Jerome Bruner and Cecile Goodman. In their classic 1947 study, they asked children to demonstrate their perception of the size of coins by manipulating the diameter of a circular aperture on a wooden box. Each child held the coin in their left hand at the same height and distance from the aperture and operated the knob to change the size of the aperture with their right hand. The children were divided into three groups, two experimental and one control, with ten children in each group. The control group was asked to estimate the size of coin-sized cardboard discs instead of actual coins. On average, the children of the experimental groups overestimated the size of the coins by thirty percent. In a second iteration of the experiment, Bruner and Goodman divided the children into groups based on economic status. Again, both the &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;rich&quot; groups were asked to estimate the size of real coins by manipulating the diameter of the aperture. As was expected, both groups overestimated the size of the coins, but the &quot;poor&quot; group overestimated the size by as much as fifty percent, which was up to thirty percent more than the &quot;rich&quot; group. From these results Bruner and Goodman concluded that poorer children felt a greater desire for money and thus perceived the coins as larger. This hypothesis formed the basis of the New Look psychological approach which suggests that the subjective experience of an object influences the visual perception of that object. Some psychodynamic psychologists adopted the views of the New Look approach in order to explain how individuals might protect themselves from disturbing visual stimuli. The psychodynamic perspective lost support because it lacked a sufficient model to account for how the unconscious could influence perception.

Although some further research was able to replicate the results found by Bruner and Goodman, the New Look approach was mostly abandoned by the 1970s because the experiments were riddled with methodological errors that did not account for confounding factors such as reporter bias and context. Recent research has brought about a revival of New Look perspectives, but with methodological improvements to resolve the outstanding issues that plagued the original studies.

==Reverse wishful thinking and seeing==
This process occurs when threat increases. The Ebbinghaus illusion has been used to measure reverse wishful seeing, with participants observing negative flanker targets underestimated less than positive or neutral targets. Feelings of fear also lead to perception of the feared object as closer just as prior research suggests that desired objects are perceived as closer.
Furthermore, some people are less inclined to wishful thinking/seeing based on their emotional states or personality.

==Underlying mechanisms==
===Cognition===
Concrete cognitive mechanisms underlying wishful thinking and wishful seeing are unknown. Since these concepts are still developing, research on the mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon is still in progress. However, some mechanisms have been proposed.
Wishful thinking could be attributed to three mechanisms: attentional bias, interpretation bias or response bias. Therefore, there are three different stages in cognitive processing in which wishful thinking could arise. First, at the lowest stage of cognitive processing, individuals selectively attend to cues. Individuals can attend to evidence that supports their desires and neglect contradictory evidence. Second, wishful thinking could be generated by selective interpretation of cues. In this case, an individual is not changing their attention to the cue but the attribution of importance to the cue. Finally, wishful thinking can arise at a higher stage of cognitive processing, such as when forming a response to the cue and inserting bias.

Wishful seeing can be attributed to the same mechanisms as wishful thinking because it involves the processing of situational cues, including visual cues. However, with preconscious processing of visual cues and their associations with desirable outcomes, interpretation bias and response bias are not plausible since they occur in conscious cognitive processing stages. Therefore, a fourth mechanism called perceptual set can also explain this phenomenon. This mechanism proposes that mental states or associations activated before an object comes into view subtly guide the visual system during processing. Therefore, cues are readily recognized when they are related to such a mental state or association.

Some speculate that wishful seeing results from cognitive penetrability in that higher cognitive functions are able to directly influence perceptual experience instead of only influencing perception at higher levels of processing. Those that argue against cognitive penetrability feel that sensory systems operate in a modular fashion with cognitive states exerting their influence only after the stimuli has been perceived. The phenomenon of wishful seeing implicates cognitive penetrability in the perceptual experience.
Wishful seeing has been observed to occur in early stages of categorization. Research using ambiguous figures and binocular rivalry exhibit this tendency. Perception is influenced by both top-down and bottom-up processing. In visual processing, bottom-up processing is a rigid route compared to flexible top-down processing. Within bottom-up processing, the stimuli are recognized by fixation points, proximity and focal areas to build objects, while top-down processing is more context sensitive. This effect can be observed via priming as well as with emotional states. The traditional hierarchical models of information processing describe early visual processing as a one-way street: early visual processing goes into conceptual systems, but conceptual systems do not affect visual processes. Currently, research rejects this model and suggests conceptual information can penetrate early visual processing rather than just biasing the perceptual systems. This occurrence is called conceptual or cognitive penetrability. Research on conceptual penetrability utilize stimuli of conceptual-category pairs and measure the reaction time to determine if the category effect influenced visual processing, The category effect is the difference in reaction times within the pairs such as &quot;Bb&quot; to &quot;Bp&quot;. To test conceptual penetrability, there were simultaneous and sequential judgments of pairs. The reaction times decreased as the stimulus onset asynchrony increased, supporting categories affect visual representations and conceptual penetrability. Research with richer stimuli such as figures of cats and dogs allow for greater perceptual variability and analysis of stimulus typicality (cats and dogs were arranged in various positions, some more or less typical for recognition). Differentiating the pictures took longer when they were within the same category (doga-dogb) compared between categories (dog-cat) supporting category knowledge influences categorization. Therefore, visual processing measured by physical differential judgments is affected by non-visual processing supporting conceptual penetrability.

===Neural circuitry===
The areas of the brain that motivate wishful seeing and thinking are associated with the same regions that underlie social identification and reward. A study looked at these structures using MRI while participants estimated the winning probabilities for a series of football teams. Prior to this estimation, the individuals specified their favorite, neutral and least favorite NFL teams. Wishful thinking has been associated with social identity theory where individual seem to prefer in-group members over out-group members. In this case, these individuals preferred the football team they most identified.

During wishful thinking tasks, differential activity was found in three areas of the brain: dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, the parietal lobe, and the fusiform gyrus in the occipital lobe. Differential activity in the occipital and parietal areas suggests a mode of selective attention to the cues presented; therefore, supporting a lower-level cognitive processing or attention bias. However, differential activity in the prefrontal cortex also suggests higher-cognitive processing. The prefrontal cortex activity is related to preferences involved in social identification. As a result, when cues are relevant to an individual, such as a favorite football team, the prefrontal cortex is activated. This identification of self carries hedonic value which in turn stimulates the reward system. Differential activation of the reward system areas was only seen in conjunction with the activation of occipital lobe. Thus, the activation of the reward system with an identification of self could lead to guidance of visual attention.

Magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) pathways, which feed into the orbitofrontal cortex, play important roles in top-down processes that are susceptible to cognitive penetrability. Magnocellular processing biased stimuli deferentially activates the orbitofrontal cortex; fast magnocellular projections link early visual and inferotemporal object recognition and work with the orbitofrontal cortex by helping generate early object predictions based on perceptual sets. Stimuli were M-biased with low-luminance, achromatic line drawings or P-biased with isoluminate, chromatic line drawings and participants were asked if the drawing was larger or smaller than a shoebox. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to monitor brain activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and ventrotemporal regions to determine which pathway aided faster object recognition. The results supported that magnocellular neurons play a vital role in low-resolution object recognition as the neurons aid in quickly triggering top-down processes that provide initial guesses that lead to faster object recognition.

==Attention==

Humans have a physiologically limited visual field that must be selectively directed to certain stimuli. Attention is the cognitive process that allows this task to be accomplished and it might be responsible for the phenomenon of wishful seeing. Expectations, desires and fears are among the various factors that help direct attention. Consequently, these cognitive experiences have the opportunity to influence the perceptual experience. In turn, attention can organize planned movement, providing a mechanism through which visual stimuli can influence behavior.

Attentional deficits can also lead to altered perceptual experiences. Inattentional blindness, where unexpected events go by undetected, is one such deficit. Using an inattentional blindness paradigm, researchers, White and Davies, had participants fixate on a cross in the center of the screen. First, a number cue denoting the number of letters that would appear on the arms of the cross appeared in the center of the cross. Following the cue, the actual letters would appear on the arms of the cross. Over four trials, the number of letters matched the number that was cued. On the fifth trial, half of the participants were cued to expect a smaller number of letters and half were cued to expect the correct number of letters. The letters then appeared on the screen accompanied by an unexpected stimulus. Participants were asked which letters appeared and whether they had seen any additional object. Participants cued to expect fewer letters were more susceptible to inattentional blindness as they failed to detect the unexpected stimulus more often than participants who had been cued to expect the correct number of stimuli. These results indicate that attentional capacity is affected by expectations. This provides further evidence that cognitive processes converge in order to help construct the perceptual experience.

Although attention can lead to enhanced perceptual processing, the lack of attention to stimuli can also lead to a perceived enhanced perception of the stimuli. Participants were pre-cued that indicated the diagonal to which they should be attending. They were then presented with stimuli (gratings with different textures) and then a response cue that indicated the diagonal for which the participants had to judge their perception. 70% of the time the response cue matched the pre-cue and 30% of the time did not match the pre-cue. The participants were asked to report the texture of the gratings that appeared in the response-cue and discriminate its visibility. This set-up allowed them to compare the perception of attended (cued) and non-attended stimuli (uncued). Higher visibility was reported for stimuli that was unattended. Therefore, inattention lead to an overestimation of perception sensitivity. This study suggests attention bias, a mechanism of wishful thinking, does not only rely on what individuals fixate upon, but the unattended stimuli as well.

===Interpretation of emotion===
Emotion is often interpreted through visual cues on the face, body language and context. However, context and cultural backgrounds have been shown to influence the visual perception and interpretation of emotion. Cross-cultural differences in change blindness have been associated with perceptual set, or a tendency to attend to visual scenes in a particular way. For example, eastern cultures tend to emphasize the background of an object, while western cultures focus on the central objects in a scene. Perceptual sets are also the result of cultural aesthetic preferences. Therefore, cultural context can influence how people sample information from a face, just like they would do in a situational context. For example, Caucasians generally fixate around eyes, nose and mouth, while Asians fixate on eyes. Individuals from different cultural backgrounds who were shown a series of faces and asked to sort them into piles in which every face showed the same emotion. Fixation on different features of the face leads to disparate reading of emotions. Asians&#x27; focus on the eyes lead to the perception of startled faces as surprise rather than fear. As a result, previous associations or customs of an individual can lead to different categorization or recognition of emotion. This particular difference in visual perception of emotion seems to suggest an attention bias mechanism for wishful seeing, since certain visual cues were attended to (e.g. nose, eyes) and the others were ignored (e.g. mouth).

===Optimism===
Wishful seeing is also linked to optimism bias through which individuals tend to expect positive outcomes from events despite such expectations having little basis in reality. In order to determine the neural correlates underlying optimism bias, one functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study imaged the brains of individuals as they recalled autobiographical moments related to life events and then rated their memories on several scales. These ratings revealed that participants viewed future positive events as more positive than past positive events and negative events as more temporally distant. The active brain regions, compared to a fixation point, were the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and the right amygdala. Both of these areas became less active when imagining negative future events. The rACC is implicated in assessing emotional content and has strong connections to the amygdala. It is suggested that the rACC regulates activation in brain regions associated with emotion and autobiographical memory, thus allowing for the projection of positivity onto images of future events.

It is important to consider physical aspects such as eye movement and brain activity and their relationship to wishful thinking, wishful seeing, and optimism. Isaacowitz (2006) investigated the motivational role of gaze, which he claims is highly correlated to an individual&#x27;s interests and personality. In his study, participants who embodied varying levels of self-reported optimism were directed to look at images of skin cancer, line drawings that were similar to the cancer pictures, and neutral faces. Using a remote eye tracking system that measured the movement of the participants gaze, Isaacowitz found that more optimistically minded young adults gazed less on the skin cancer images when compared to the less optimistically minded participants. This data was replicated in a follow-up study in which participants were screened for their genetically based risk for contracting skin cancer (even though some participants were more at risk than others, higher levels of optimism were correlated with a less fixated gaze on the skin cancer images despite the fact that the images were relevant to some participants).

==Methodology==
Wishful thinking is often studied in the context of psychology through the application of ambiguous figure studies, the hypothesis being that when presented with an ambiguous stimuli, the participant will interpret the stimuli in a certain way depending on the conditions or priming the participant experiences.

Balcetis and Dunning (2013) investigated wishful seeing by conducting two experiments, one involving two ambiguous stimuli that could be perceived as &quot;B&quot; or &quot;13&quot;, and the other either a horse or a seal. The second experiment was a binocular rivalry test in which the participants were presented simultaneously with the letter &quot;H&quot; or number &quot;4&quot; (one stimuli in each eye). In each experiment, the experimenters associated one of the stimuli with desirable outcomes, and the other with a negative outcome (i.e. the &quot;B&quot; was associated with freshly squeezed orange juice while the &quot;13&quot; was associated with an undesirable health food smoothie, and in the binocular rivalry experiment, letters were associated with economic gain while numbers were associated with economic loss). The results of the experiment demonstrated that participants were more likely to perceive the stimulus that was associated with a positive situation or outcome than the stimulus associated with negative situations. This strong correlation between perception and positive versus negative stimuli demonstrates that we tend to see the world based on our own desires. The concept of wishful seeing hints towards a motivation-based perception process.

Balcetis and Dale (2007) further considered that we view the world in biased ways in their four-prong study, one part of which addressed motivated object interpretation using a situation involving the interpretation of an ambiguous object (i.e. a Necker cube) that lacks the language based labels that the priming information may suggest to the participants. Many studies claim that what humans perceive or see is based on our internal motivation and goals, but it is important to consider that some priming situations in certain studies, or even the internal views of the participant, can affect the interpretation of a stimulus. With these considerations in mind, Balcetis and Dale (2007), divided 124 Cornell University undergraduates into three groups which were each asked to imagine one of three detailed conditions: an upward-looking condition (participants were asked to imagine looking up at a large building), a downward-looking position (looking into a deep canyon), and a neutral/flat condition (standing in a flat field). The participants were then shown an ambiguous Necker cube on a computer screen and were told to click one of the two blue lines that seemed the closest to them. The line the participants chose depended on whether they determined the cube to be facing upwards or downwards. The results of the study demonstrated that the majority of participants in the upward-looking condition saw the cube as facing upwards, the majority of downwards-looking conditioned patients saw the cube as facing downwards, and the participants in the neutral condition were evenly divided. These results show that the priming stimulus language influenced object identification. Motivation-affected object identification was observed in each condition.

Similar results were seen in a study conducted by Changizi and Hall (2001), which addressed wishful thinking and goal-oriented object identification by investigating levels of thirst among participants in relation to their tendency to identify an ambiguously transparent stimulus as transparent (the study states that transparency is a natural yet unobvious quality directly related to water, a typically clear substance). The results of the study showed a clear tendency for the thirsty participants (who were directed to eat a bag of potato chips immediately preceding the study) to interpret the ambiguous stimuli as transparent. Furthermore, the participants who were not thirsty (they were directed to drink water before the study until they reported themselves as not thirsty) were less likely to interpret the ambiguous stimuli as transparent. The study concludes that an alteration of a biological state, in this case the participants&#x27; level of thirstiness, that inspires wishful thinking, can directly affect the perception of visual stimuli.

Bastardi, Uhlmann, and Ross (2011), showed the effects of wishful thinking when they presented parents with two fictional studies involving day care versus home care for their children. The parents who were conflicted (planned to use day care despite believing home care to be superior) more positively rated the &quot;study&quot; that claimed day care as superior and more negatively rated the study that claimed home care was better. The unconflicted parents (those that thought home care was superior to day care and planned to use only home care) rated the study that claimed home care was better more positively. The parents rated the studies that claimed what they actually planned for their children was the superior action, even though (in the case of the conflicted parents) the study may have been in opposition to their original beliefs. In a post-experiment evaluation, the conflicted parents changed their initial beliefs and claimed to believe that home care was no better than day care, and the unconflicted parents continued to claim home care to be superior, though to a lesser degree.

Balcetis and Dunning (2012) used the natural ambiguity found in judging distances to measure the effects of wishful seeing. During the study participants judged the distance to various stimuli while the experimenters manipulated the desirability of the stimuli. In one study, participants had their thirst intensified by consuming a large portion of their daily sodium intake or quenched by drinking to satiety. They were then asked to estimate the distance to a bottle of water. Those participants who were thirstier ranked the bottle of water as more desirable and viewed it as closer than less thirsty participants. Another study performed by Balcetis and Dunning had participants estimate the distance to test results that contained either positive or negative feedback and to $100 gift cards that they had the possibility of either winning or not. Participants viewed the forms as closer when they contained positive feedback and the $100 gift cards as closer when there was a possibility that they might win them. Balcetis and Dunning took into account the possible influence of positive mood by measuring creativity through a word creation task, and arousal by physiological markers. The experimenters also eliminated reporter bias in one of their studies by having participants throw a beanbag toward a gift card adhered to the floor. Underthrowing the beanbag indicated that the participant perceived the gift card as closer, while overthrowing the beanbag indicated that the participant perceived the gift card as further away. Their results suggest that there is a positivity bias in the perception of distance.

The relationship between distance perception and positivity may be more complicated than originally thought because context can also influence the distortion of perception. In fact, in threatening situations, positivity bias may be put aside to enable an appropriate response. In turn, the perceptual exaggerations brought on by threatening stimuli can be negated by psychosocial resources. Psychosocial resources are defined by the Resources and Perception Model (RPM) as social support, self-worth, self- esteem, self-efficacy, hope, optimism, perceived control and self-disclosure. The participants reported distance measures while the experimenters manipulated the self-worth of the participants through mental imagery exercises, as well as their exposure to threatening (a tarantula) or non-threatening (a cat toy) stimuli. An effect of self-worth was only observed upon exposure to the threatening stimuli, when increased self-worth was correlated with a more realistic estimate of the distance to the threatening stimuli.

===Representations of environment===
Another common area in which wishful seeing can be observed is through environmental representations. Many studies have supported that desire or motivations affect estimates of size, distance, speed, length and slope of environments or targets. For example, people will perceive desired objects as closer. Wishful seeing also affects athletes&#x27; perception of balls and other equipment. For example, softball players who see the ball as bigger, hit better; tennis players who return better, see the net as lower and the ball as moving slower.

Distance and slope perception is affected by energy levels. Subjects with a heavier load see hills as steeper and distances as farther. Targets placed uphill seem farther away than those on flat ground. Fit people perceive hills as shallower while fatigued runners see hills as steeper. This perception is modulated by what has been coined as &quot;efficient energy expenditure.&quot; In other words, perceived increase in effort (a steeper slope) when physically exhausted, might prompt individuals to rest rather than expend more energy.

Distance perception is also affected by cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance was manipulated by high choice groups which were led to believe they chose to wear a Carmen Miranda outfit to walk across campus versus a low choice group which was told they had to wear the outfit. To reduce cognitive dissonance in high choice groups the subjects changed their attitude to match the situation. Thus, they perceived their environment in a less extreme way (shorter distance) than low choice groups. Similar results followed with a perception of slope test, in which participants were in high and low choice groups to push themselves up a slope on skateboard with only their arms. Again, the high choice group perceived the slope as shallower than the low choice in order to reduce cognitive dissonance. Both of these studies suggest that intrapsychic motives play a role in perception of environments in order to encourage the perceiver to engage in behaviors that lead them either to acquire a desired object or be able to complete a desired task.

==Procrastination and motivation ==
Sigall, Kruglanski, and Fyock (2000) found that people who were assessed to be high wishful thinkers were more likely to procrastinate when motivated to do so (by being told that the task they were about to do was unpleasant). When told the task was going to be pleasant, there was little difference in the amount of procrastination, showing that when motivated, wishful thinkers may consider themselves more capable of doing the task in a lesser amount of time, therefore exhibiting wishful thinking and considering themselves more capable than they are, and as a result, put off working on the unpleasant task.

<text>The Royal College of Physicians of London, commonly referred to simply as the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), is a British professional membership body dedicated to improving the practice of medicine, chiefly through the accreditation of physicians by examination. Founded by royal charter from King Henry VIII in 1518, as the College of Physicians, the RCP is the oldest medical college in England. 

The RCP&#x27;s home in Regent&#x27;s Park is one of the few post-war buildings to be listed at Grade I. In 2016 it was announced that the RCP was to open new premises in Liverpool at The Spine, a new building in the Liverpool Knowledge Quarter. The Spine opened in May 2021.

==History==

The college was incorporated as &quot;the President and College or Commonalty of the Faculty of Physic in London&quot; when it received a royal charter in 1518, affirmed by Act of Parliament in 1523. It is not known when the name &quot;Royal College of Physicians of London&quot; was first assumed or granted. It came into use after the charter of 1663, and was used to make reference to the college in the Medical Act 1858. It was legally authorised as the college&#x27;s corporate name by the Royal College of Physicians of London Act 1960, the function of which was primarily to move the premises of the college outside the cities of London or Westminster to Regent&#x27;s Park.

The college was based at three sites in the City of London near St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, before moving to Pall Mall East (overlooking Trafalgar Square), and then to its current location in Regent&#x27;s Park.

The first Harveian Librarian was Christopher Merret, a fellow of the college and a friend of Harvey. He was set up with a lifetime appointment that compensated him with room and board and a small stipend. In 1666, the Great Fire of London destroyed many of the rooms and most of the books, so they tried to break the contract with Merret, but he fought them at the King&#x27;s Court, claiming it was a lifetime appointment. He eventually lost the case, was expelled from the Fellowship, had to seek private lodgings and return the books he had rescued from the fire. 

The college became the licensing body for medical books in the late seventeenth century, and sought to set new standards in learning through its own system of examinations. The college&#x27;s tradition of examining continues to this day and it is still perhaps how the college is best known to the general public.

The Royal College of Physicians celebrated its 500-year anniversary in 2018.

==Membership and fellowship==
===Membership===
The MRCP(UK) postnominal is used by doctors who have passed the examinations for the Diploma of Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of the United Kingdom, which are held jointly by all of the UK Royal Colleges of Physicians. Holders of the MRCP(UK) may also become &quot;Collegiate Members&quot; of the London College (using the additional post-nominal MRCP(Lond)) and/or of the other two UK colleges. Affiliate membership of the Royal College of Physicians is a similar level of membership as collegiate membership, but is awarded to senior doctors without MRCP(UK). Both Collegiate Members and Affiliate Members may be considered for advancement to fellowship of the college.

The college also has associate, medical student, and foundation doctor levels of membership.

===Fellowship===

Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians (who use the post-nominal FRCP) are elected mostly from the general membership (collegiate or affiliate), but also occasionally from among the members of the more specialised faculties within the Royal Colleges of Physicians, e.g. Occupational Medicine (MFOM), Pharmaceutical Medicine (MFPM), and Forensic and Legal Medicine (MFLM), etc.
There are also fellows who are elected &quot;de jure&quot; (usually medical experts from other countries) and &quot;honoris causa&quot; (dignitaries, members of the Royal Family, etc.).

Physicians from the Royal College of Physicians published a series of works containing biographical entries of the fellows called Munk&#x27;s Roll.

==Library==
The library aims to support the learning and information needs of the members, students, and staff of the college. The unique collections may also used for research by members of the public. An enquiry service provides information on the current role and functions of the RCP as well as its history. The library holds books on a range of subjects including:
* history of medicine
* genealogy
* health and social policy
* medical education

===Rare book collections===
The Royal College of Physicians has had a library collection since its foundation in 1518, although most of the original books were destroyed during the Great Fire of London in 1666. The rare books and special collections are diverse in coverage, reflecting the collecting habits of earlier fellows and the need to provide the broad educational base considered suitable for physicians. The rare books are normally available to the general public, by appointment, Monday to Friday 10 am – 5 pm.

Books and journals—new and old—display a continuum of change and development in the RCP&#x27;s specialties, as well as in the medical profession. Highlights include:
* approximately 130 books printed before 1502, including some of the earliest printings of the classical medical texts by Greek, Roman and Arabic doctors
* books belonging to and annotated by the Elizabethan astrologer and occultist John Dee
* approximately 3,000 books, dated up to 1688, in the Dorchester collection, on a variety of subjects including architecture, science and travel
* over 4,500 tracts from the 17th to the 19th century covering a wide range of subjects, both medical and scientific
* the Evan Bedford collection, which includes almost every significant text in the history of cardiology up to 1970

Highlights of the 20th-century collection include:
* books relating to the history of the RCP&#x27;s specialties
* biographies of fellows and prominent figures in medicine
* books relating to the formation of the National Health Service (NHS) and its continuing history
* books relating to the history of hospitals in the UK
* books relating to medical ethics and the status and role of the physician
* every item published by the RCP, including reports and pamphlets.

The book collections are displayed in regularly changing exhibitions.

In December 2020 the college&#x27;s Board of Trustees (BoT) discussed in detail the RCP&#x27;s financial position, which, like so many charities, had been impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. All aspects of RCP activity had come under review and a range of cost reduction and income generation options considered, including the possible sale of non-medical books from its collection. The BoT recognised that this had caused concern for some quarters of the membership and agreed to delay such a sale for the immediate future.

==Museum collections==
The museum collections at the Royal College of Physicians relate to the history of the college, and the history of the Physician&#x27;s profession. They help to place the history and development of medicine and health care in its widest context. The collections include: portraits, silver, medical instruments, the Symons Collection, commemorative medals and anatomical tables.

The collection of c. 250 portraits provides a pictorial and sculptural record of presidents, Fellows and other physicians associated with it from its foundation in 1518 to the present day. It includes pieces by well-known artists, such as a bust of Baldwin Hamey Junior (1600–1676) by Edward Pierce and one of Richard Mead (1673–1754) by Louis François Roubiliac. There are portraits, such as that of Richard Hale (1670–1728) by Jonathan Richardson. In 1964 a volume on the &quot;Portraits&quot; of the college was published by Gordon Wolstenholme in which they were described by David Piper.

The silver collection has few pieces pre-dating the Great Fire of London (1666) because of a robbery during the previous year. Baldwin Hamey&#x27;s inkstand bell and William Harvey&#x27;s whalebone demonstration rod, tipped with silver, are two that survive. Many pieces of silver are used to this day for formal occasions in the college. Special objects include the President&#x27;s staff of office, the caduceus and the silver-gilt College mace.

The college also owns six 17th-century anatomical tables, probably made by drying and mounting the actual blood vessels and nerves of the human body onto blocks of wood and then varnishing them. They would have been used as a teaching aid for teaching anatomy, because it was difficult to obtain cadavers for dissection.

The Symons Collection of medical instruments is displayed within the college building. It began as a collection of objects relating to self-care in Georgian times and expanded to include items that would have been used by physicians when treating patients, mostly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The collections can be searched via an online catalogue and items on display are open to the general public Monday to Friday 9 am – 5 pm. The Royal College of Physicians is a member of the London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine.

==Archives==
The archive collections date back to the foundation of the Royal College of Physicians in 1518 and include the original Royal charter granted by King Henry VIII. The activities of the college are preserved in official minutes and other institutional records dating from the 16th century to the present.

Over 200 collections of personal papers reflect the experiences of practitioners and patients over the last 500 years. These collections include items dating back to the 13th century which relate to the history of medicine and science in Europe.

In the 19th century, William Munk, a fellow with a keen interest in medical biography started collection information about all the physicians who had either been licensed by the College or became a member. After years of research the resulting biographies were compiled into 3 volumes which included everyone who was a member of, or licensed by the college up to 1825. These volumes, published between 1861 and 1878 were the start of a series, known as Munk&#x27;s Roll after the original compiler. Later volumes focussed on fellows and the series is now online with regular updates ensuring there is a biography for every past fellow from 1518 to the present.

The archive continues to collect records that demonstrate the developing roles of physicians, including oral recordings of practitioners reflecting on their lives and careers. The collections can be searched via an online catalogue, and are available to the general public by appointment. The &#x27;Voices of medicine&#x27; oral histories are available to listen to via the library catalogue.

==Facility==

The college is located in St. Andrews Place, which is at the north end of the road running up the east side of Regent&#x27;s Park, Park Square East. The college&#x27;s previous headquarters, on Pall Mall East/Trafalgar Square, is now Canada House, part of the Canadian high commission in London. The college had a number of other locations prior to Pall Mall East, in the City of London.

The current College building was designed by architect Sir Denys Lasdun, opening in 1964 and has since been recognised as a building of national importance: it is a Grade I listed building, one of a very select band of post-war buildings sharing this distinction. Lasdun&#x27;s use of mosaic clad concrete was extremely influential on many later public buildings. An interesting feature of the building was a &#x27;Moving Wall&#x27;, weighing five tons (5080 kg) and capable of being hydraulically lifted ten feet (3050 mm) to unite or sub-divide a hall of sixty-two feet (18.9 m) width, which was the interior width of the building. The hydraulic equipment and the steel framework for the Moving Wall were produced by Merryweather &amp; Sons Ltd of Greenwich, hydraulic engineers. Although better known for fire fighting equipment it was not the company&#x27;s first installation of this kind.

==Publications==
The college publishes two peer-reviewed medical journals. &quot;Clinical Medicine&quot; and &quot;Future Healthcare Journal&quot;. In addition, it publishes regular reports, clinical guidelines, policy papers and online resources. &quot;Occupational and Environmental Medicine&quot; is the official journal of the Faculty of Occupational Medicine.

&quot;Commentary&quot; is the membership magazine. It is published every 2 months. 

==Faculties==
The Royal College of Physicians hosts six training faculties: the Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine, the Faculty for Pharmaceutical Medicine, the Faculty of Occupational Medicine the Faculty of Public Health, the Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine and the Faculty of Physician Associates.

=== Forensic and Legal Medicine ===
The Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine (FFLM) was established as a faculty of the RCP in 2006 to develop and maintain the highest possible standards of competence and professional integrity in forensic and legal medicine. The specialty covers professionals working in three related disciplines: forensic medical practitioners (forensic physicians, forensic nurses and paramedics, forensic pathologists, sexual assault examiners, and child physical and sexual assault examiners); medico-legal advisers; and medically qualified coroners. The FFLM holds a number of exams for professionals working in Forensic and Legal Medicine. It is recognised as the authoritative body for the purpose of consultation in matters of educational or public interest concerning forensic and legal medicine.

===Pharmaceutical Medicine===
The Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine (FPM) of the royal colleges of physicians of the UK (Edinburgh, Glasgow and London) aims to advance the science and practice of pharmaceutical medicine by working to develop and maintain competence, ethics and integrity and the highest professional standards in the specialty for the benefit of the public.

===Occupational Medicine===
The Faculty of Occupational Medicine was inaugurated as a specialist faculty of the RCP in 1978. The FOM is the professional and educational body for occupational medicine in the UK and seeks to ensure the highest standards in the practice of occupational medicine.

=== Public Health ===
The Faculty of Public Health (FPH) is a joint faculty of the three royal colleges of physicians of the United Kingdom (London, Edinburgh and Glasgow). It is a membership organisation for nearly 4,000 public health professionals across the UK and around the world. Its role is to improve the health and wellbeing of local communities and national populations.

=== Sport and Exercise Medicine ===
The Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine (FSEM) UK is the governing body for the specialty of sport and exercise medicine (SEM) in the UK. It is an intercollegiate faculty of the RCP and the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.

===Physician Associates===
The Faculty of Physician Associates was founded in 2015 with the collaboration of the RCP and the UK Association of Physician Associates (UKAPA). The Faculty is the professional membership body for physician associates in the UK, and sets standards for the education and training of physician associates, publishes the PA national curriculum and oversees the running of the PA national certification examinations. It oversees the PA managed voluntary register.

On 13 March 2024 the RCP held an Extraordinary General Meeting, the third in its history, to debate the issue of physician associates and their role, scope of practice, and regulation. The controversy resulted in the resignation of the College&#x27;s President in June 2024.

==Lecture series==
The college holds an annual lecture, commonly referred to as the &quot;Lumleian Lectures&quot;, which were named in honour of Lord Lumley and established as part of the Lumleian Trust. The trust and lectures were established in 1582 by Richard Caldwell, a former president of the college. The subject matter of the lectures was initially in surgery, which was later changed to in medicine. The first lecture was given by Richard Forster, and the lectures continue to today.

Once a year, traditionally on St Luke&#x27;s Day (18 October), a Fellow is appointed to deliver the Harveian Oration to the assembled college in memory of William Harvey. The oration seeks to honour the founders and benefactors of the college and encourage a spirit of experimentation amongst the members.

Other annual lectures are the Bradshaw Lecture, the Croonian Lecture, the Goulstonian Lecture, the Fitzpatrick Lecture, and the Milroy Lectures.

==Awards==

The Bisset Hawkins Medal is a triennial award founded in 1899 in honour of Francis Bisset Hawkins, a fellow of the college, to recognise work done in the preceding ten years in advancing sanitary science or promoting public health. The Baly Medal is a biennial award, founded by a gift from Frederick Daniel Dyster (1809?–93) received in 1866, confirmed by deed 1930 – in memory of William Baly: £400 to provide a gold medal for the person deemed to have most distinguished himself in the science of physiology, especially during the previous two years.

<text>Fea&#x27;s petrel (Pterodroma feae) is a small seabird in the gadfly petrel genus, &quot;Pterodroma&quot;. It was previously considered to be a subspecies of the soft-plumaged petrel (&quot;P. mollis&quot;), but they are actually not closely related at all. However, &quot;P. feae&quot; is very closely related to Zino&#x27;s petrel and Desertas petrel, two other species recently split from &quot;P. mollis&quot;. The gadfly petrels are named for their speedy weaving flight, as if evading horseflies. The flight action is also reflected in the genus name &quot;Pterodroma&quot;, from Ancient Greek &quot;pteron&quot;, &quot;wing&quot; and &quot;dromos&quot;, &quot; runner&quot;. This species is named after the Italian zoologist Leonardo Fea (1852-1903).

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The first known recording of the &quot;soft-plumaged petrel&quot; appears to have been in October 1768 off the coast of West Africa during Captain Cook&#x27;s first voyage. While no description was published at the time, a drawing of the specimen produced by Sydney Parkinson can be recognised as the form breeding on the Cape Verde Islands. This specimen was later described as a distinct species by the Italian zoologist Tommaso Salvadori in 1900 with the binomial name &quot;Oestrelata feae&quot;, named after the Italian ornithologist Leonardo Fea and was later reclassified again as &quot;Pterodroma feae&quot;.

The gadfly petrels in the genus &quot;Pterodroma&quot; are seabirds of temperate and tropical oceans. Many are little-known and poorly studied, and their often similar appearance has meant that the taxonomy of the group has been rather fluid. The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the southern hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel &quot;P. mollis&quot;, but differences in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour and mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that the northern birds are not closely related to &quot;P. mollis&quot;, and that the Bermuda petrel or cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Sangster recommended establishing Zino&#x27;s petrel on Madeira and Fea&#x27;s petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003. More recently, some authorities have further split Fea&#x27;s petrel, separating the Desertas Islands breeding birds from those in the Cape Verde archipelago.

Sangster estimated that the two Macaronesian species diverged at the end of the Early Pleistocene, 850,000 years ago, although the methodology used to establish this time scale has subsequently been questioned. An analysis of feather lice from Fea&#x27;s petrels &quot;Pterodroma feae deserti&quot; from Bugio Island and Zino&#x27;s petrels from the Madeiran mainland showed that there were marked differences between the two seabirds in terms of the parasites they carried, suggesting that they have long been isolated, since lice can normally only be transferred through physical contact in the nest. The species on Zino&#x27;s petrel are most similar to those of the Bermuda petrel, whereas Fea&#x27;s petrel&#x27;s lice are like those of Caribbean and Pacific &quot;Pterodromas&quot;. This suggests that despite the close physical proximity of the two species of gadfly petrel found in the Madeiran archipelago, they may have arisen from separate colonisations of mainland Madeira and, later, the Desertas Islands.

==Description==
This long-winged petrel is 33–36 cm in length with an 86–94 cm wingspan. It has a grey back and wings, with a dark &quot;W&quot; marking across the wings. The undersides of the wings are dark and the belly is white. It has a fast impetuous flight. It picks planktonic food items from the ocean surface. This species is very similar to the Zino&#x27;s petrel, but is larger and has a thicker black bill.

As all three species in the &quot;Pterodroma feae/madeira/desertae&quot; complex were once believed to be subspecies of a single species: &quot;Pterodroma mollis&quot;, the extreme difficulty in telling them apart is easily understood. A summary of data from a morphological study sheds light on the issue:
* In overall size &quot;feae&quot; is closer to &quot;deserta&quot; and both are bigger than &quot;madeira&quot; (wing length - &quot;f&quot;:262, &quot;d&quot;: 264, &quot;m&quot;: 248; tarsus - &quot;f&quot;:34.7, &quot;d&quot;: 35.2, &quot;m&quot;: 32.7).
* Bill length once again similar in &quot;feae&quot; and &quot;deserta&quot; and both larger than &quot;madeira&quot; (&quot;f&quot;:29.0, &quot;d&quot;: 28.6, &quot;m&quot;: 26.3).
* Bill depth by far biggest in &quot;deserta&quot;, lowest in &quot;madeira&quot;, and intermediate in &quot;feae&quot; (&quot;f&quot;:11.9, &quot;d&quot;: 12.9, &quot;m&quot;: 10.5).
In terms of ratios:
* (Bill length/wing length) (&quot;f&quot;:11.1%, &quot;d&quot;: 10.8%, &quot;m&quot;: 10.6%) is rather similar in the three taxa.
* (Bill length/bill depth) (&quot;f&quot;: 2.44, &quot;d&quot;: 2.22, &quot;m&quot;: 2.53) is lowest in &quot;deserta&quot;, and highest in &quot;madeira&quot;. In &quot;feae&quot; it is intermediate, but more than twice closer to &quot;madeira&quot; than to &quot;deserta&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds on four islands of Cape Verde in the eastern Atlantic Ocean: Fogo, Santo Antão, São Nicolau and Santiago.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
This seabird is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by gulls. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow. This endangered species nests in colonies in burrows in spring and autumn. It lays a single white egg.

<text>Zino&#x27;s petrel (Pterodroma madeira) or the freira, is a species of small seabird in the gadfly petrel genus, endemic to the island of Madeira. This long-winged petrel has a grey back and wings, with a dark &quot;W&quot; marking across the wings, and a grey upper tail. The undersides of the wings are blackish apart from a triangle of white at the front edge near the body, and the belly is white with grey flanks. It is very similar in appearance to the slightly larger Fea&#x27;s petrel, and separating these two Macaronesian species at sea is very challenging. It was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the soft-plumaged petrel, &quot;P. mollis&quot;, but they are not closely related, and Zino&#x27;s was raised to the status of a species because of differences in morphology, calls, breeding behaviour and mitochondrial DNA. It is one of Europe&#x27;s most endangered seabirds, with breeding areas restricted to a few ledges high in the central mountains of Madeira.

Zino&#x27;s petrel nests in burrows which are visited only at night, when they give their haunting calls. The single white egg is incubated by both adults, one sitting during the day while the other feeds on fish and squid at sea. Eggs, chicks and adults have been subject to predation by introduced cats and rats, and in the past have been taken for food by local shepherds. Predator control, and other measures such as the removal of grazing animals that trample the burrows, have enabled the population to recover to 65–80 breeding pairs; the species remains listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. However, conservation efforts had a major setback in August 2010 when fires killed three adults and 65 percent of the chicks. The population eventually recovered and was stable at 160 individuals by 2018.

==Taxonomy==
The gadfly petrels in the genus &quot;Pterodroma&quot; are seabirds of temperate and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance have caused the taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid. The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the Southern Hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel, &quot;P. mollis&quot;, but mitochondrial DNA analysis, and differences in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour, showed that the northern birds are not closely related to &quot;P. mollis&quot;, and that the Bermuda petrel or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Ornithologist George Sangster recommended establishing Zino&#x27;s petrel on Madeira and Fea&#x27;s petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003.

Nunn and Zino estimated that the two Macaronesian species diverged at the end of the Early Pleistocene, 850,000 years ago. An analysis of feather lice taken from Fea&#x27;s petrels, &quot;Pterodroma feae deserti&quot;, from Bugio Island, and from Zino&#x27;s petrels from the Madeiran mainland showed that there were marked differences between the two seabirds in terms of the parasites they carried, suggesting that they have long been isolated since lice can normally only be transferred through physical contact in the nest. The species on Zino&#x27;s petrel are most similar to those of the Bermuda petrel, whereas Fea&#x27;s petrel&#x27;s lice are like those of Caribbean and Pacific &quot;Pterodroma&quot; species. This suggests that despite the close physical proximity of the two species of gadfly petrel found in the Madeiran archipelago, they may have arisen from separate colonisations of mainland Madeira and, later, the Desertas Islands. Although their reproductive isolation has allowed the separate evolutionary development of the two species, genetic evidence shows the three Macaronesian petrels are each other&#x27;s closest relatives.

The petrels breeding in the high central mountains of Madeira were first recorded in 1903 by German naturalist and priest Ernst Johann Schmitz, who failed to realise that they were different from the Fea&#x27;s petrels he had seen in the Desertas. The species was formally described as a race of soft-plumaged petrel by Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1934. Following the recognition of the Madeiran birds as a full species, they were named after the British ornithologist, Paul Alexander Zino, who was instrumental in their conservation during the latter half of the twentieth century. The genus name &quot;Pterodroma&quot; is derived from Greek &quot;πτερον&quot;, &quot;pteron&quot;, &quot;a wing&quot;, and &quot;δρομος&quot;, &quot;dromos&quot;, &quot;running&quot;, and refers to the bird&#x27;s swift erratic flight. The specific &quot;madeira&quot; refers to the island on which it breeds. The Portuguese name &quot;Freira&quot; means &quot;nun&quot;; the inhabitants of Curral das Freiras (Nun&#x27;s Valley) near the breeding site claimed that the nocturnal wailing of the petrels in the breeding season were the calls of the suffering souls of the nuns. The sisters had taken refuge in the valley from attacks on the island by French pirates in 1566 that lasted for 15 days.

&quot;Pterodroma&quot; petrel remains dated between 60,000 and 25,000 years BP were found in two cave sites in Gibraltar. They consist of a more abundant form similar in size to Zino&#x27;s, and a larger, less common type. It is uncertain whether they represent the site of a former breeding colony, or are the result of a seabird wreck in which storms blow birds inland. They do suggest, however, that members of the genus were formerly more widespread.

==Description==

This long-winged petrel is long with an , and an average weight of 290 g (10.3 in). It has a grey , grey wings with a dark &quot;W&quot; marking across them, and a grey upper tail. The undersides of the wings are blackish, apart from a triangle of white at the front edge near the body, and the is white with grey . The head has a mottled whitish-brown , a dark cap, and a dark spot below and behind the brown eye. The is black and the legs are flesh pink, the colour continuing onto the first third of the feet, the rest of the toes and webs being black-brown. It gives the general impression of a small Cory&#x27;s or great shearwater, with a fast flight; in strong winds it shears high above the surface with angled wings. Nothing is known of the fresh juvenile or the moult sequence, and age assessment is currently not feasible.

This species is very similar in appearance to the Fea&#x27;s petrel, but is smaller. The size difference and lighter flight may not be apparent at sea, especially with lone birds, but a recent study helped to clarify other useful features. Zino&#x27;s has a diagnostically small, delicate, often rather long and slender bill, which may be obvious in the most slender-billed examples, which are probably mostly females, but can be difficult to determine in larger-billed, probably adult male, birds. Another useful feature is a large whitish panel on the . The wing panel is exclusive to Zino&#x27;s but is only shown by 15% of the birds. Zino&#x27;s has a more rounded wing tip, but &quot;P. feae deserti&quot; sometimes shows a rounded wing tip, so this feature is not diagnostic. Previously suggested criteria such as head, upper wing and flank patterns were found to be inconclusive. Off the eastern United States and the Azores, both Macaronesian petrels are easily distinguished from the larger Bermuda petrel by that species&#x27; , which are uniformly dark but for a pale grey .

This species at its breeding sites gives a long mournful call like the hooting of a tawny owl, and a much less frequent sound like the whimpering of a pup. It is silent at sea. The breeding calls are very similar to those of Fea&#x27;s petrel, and Bretagnolle&#x27;s analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms &quot;madeira&quot;, &quot;feae&quot; and &quot;deserti&quot; all as subspecies of Fea&#x27;s petrel.

===&quot;Snowy-winged petrel&quot;===
The Hadoram Shirihai expeditions to the Madeira archipelago in 2008, 2009, and 2010 each had sightings of a &quot;Pterodroma&quot; petrel (possibly the same bird) with largely white underwings, but upper wings like Zino&#x27;s or Fea&#x27;s. This plumage does not correspond to any known &quot;Pterodroma&quot; species. It may have been an unusual variant of Zino&#x27;s but this is unlikely since no similar bird has been seen amongst the more than 100 caught at the nest. It may alternatively be a single aberrant individual, a hybrid or an unknown taxon from Madeira or elsewhere. No conclusion is possible on current knowledge.

==Distribution and habitat==

Zino&#x27;s petrel is endemic to the main island of Madeira, where it breeds on inaccessible and well-vegetated ledges in the central mountains between Pico do Arieiro and Pico Ruivo. The typical ledge plants are endemic hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes, but grasses may also be present. It nests at heights above . It was formerly more widespread, since subfossil remains have been found in a cave in eastern Madeira, and on nearby Porto Santo Island. The breeding ledges have to be inaccessible to introduced goats so that they remain rich in endemic flora. The vegetation ensures that there is sufficient earth on the ledges to allow the birds to burrow and make their nests, and trampling by grazing animals reduces the soil cover.

This petrel is only present in Madeiran waters during the breeding season. Its distribution at sea during the rest of the year is poorly known due to the rarity of the species and the difficulty of separating it from other &quot;Pterodroma&quot; petrels at sea. Birds identified as either Zino&#x27;s or Fea&#x27;s have been recorded from both sides of the North Atlantic, and in Ireland and Britain there has been a large increase in the number of reports, perhaps because global warming brings increasing numbers of tropical species into temperate waters. The timing of the reports, mainly in late spring and summer in the western North Atlantic, and in late summer and early autumn in the east, has suggested that birds follow a clockwise route around the North Atlantic after leaving their breeding sites. However, the few birds that have been identified with certainty have all been Fea&#x27;s. Zino&#x27;s petrel may have a similar strategy since preliminary results from geolocation studies indicate widespread dispersal over the North Atlantic central ridge during the breeding season and migration towards the Brazilian coast in the non-breeding period. &quot;Pterodroma&quot; petrels have been recorded in the Canary Islands and the Azores on surprisingly few occasions; a claim of possible Zino&#x27;s from South Africa is now thought to be erroneous.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===

Zino&#x27;s petrel breed two months earlier than the Fea&#x27;s petrel on Bugio, only away. The birds return from sea to their breeding grounds in late March or early April and courting occurs over the main breeding area during the late evening and early morning hours. The nest is a shallow burrow or old rabbit tunnel up to long in thick soil on vegetated ledges. The length of the burrow is related to the age of the pair that uses it, young birds making shorter tunnels, which are extended in subsequent years. The oval white egg is laid from mid-May to mid-June in a chamber at the end of the burrow and for 51–54 days, each parent alternating between sitting on the nest and feeding at sea. The young fledge about 85 days later in late September and October. This petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by gulls. It stays offshore during the day, coming to land in darkness. It calls from about 30 minutes after nightfall until dawn, including on moonlit nights.

This species mates for life and pairs return to the same burrow year after year. The single egg is not replaced if lost. This is a long-lived species: one individual was observed to return to its burrow for ten consecutive years, and the lifespan is estimated to be about 16 years. The age of first breeding is unknown but assumed to be four or more years. Despite the proximity of their breeding sites, Zino&#x27;s and Fea&#x27;s petrels have never been found at each other&#x27;s nesting areas, and Zino&#x27;s is not known to hybridise with any other species.

===Feeding===
Zino&#x27;s petrel, like its relatives, feed on small squid and fish. The vomited stomach contents of one bird contained cephalopods, the bioluminiscent fish &quot;Electrona risso&quot; and small crustaceans. Like other small petrels, Zino&#x27;s does not normally follow ships.

===Predators and parasites===
Their nocturnal approach to the breeding sites means that Zino&#x27;s petrels avoid the attentions of gulls or diurnal raptors, and the only owl on the island, the barn owl, is a rodent hunter. Other than bats, there are no native land mammals on Madeira, although there are a number of introduced species, two of which will take birds or chicks. These are brown rats and feral domestic cats. Even the high mountain nest sites of the Zino&#x27;s petrel are not safe from these adaptable predators, ten adults being killed by cats in 1990. Feather lice found on Zino&#x27;s petrels include &quot;Trabeculus schillingi&quot;, &quot;Saemundssonia&quot; species and an unnamed species of &quot;Halipeurus&quot;.

==Conservation status==
Zino&#x27;s petrel has a very restricted range on the mountaintops of a single island and is one of Europe’s most endangered seabirds. The birds, already confined to a limited area when discovered, were thought to be extinct by the mid-twentieth century. Two freshly fledged juveniles were found within the walls of the governor&#x27;s palace in Funchal in the early 1940s, presumably attracted there by lights, but the species was not seen again until 1969. In 1969, Paul Zino played a tape of Fea&#x27;s petrel from Bugio to a shepherd from Curral das Freiras; he immediately recognised the call and led the researchers to the remaining nesting area. Predation by introduced rats meant that breeding success in the small population was low, and no young at all fledged in 1985. The Freira Conservation Project was founded in 1986 with the aim of increasing the population of Zino&#x27;s petrel by controlling rats and human interference; the control was extended to cats after the mass predation of 1990.

There are now 130–160 known individuals (65–80 breeding pairs) confirmed to breed on just six ledges. There may be some disturbance from visitors at night and from the construction of a NATO radar station on the summit of Mount Arieiro, and in the longer term climate change may have an adverse effect, since all nests are within of the top of the highest mountain in the breeding area. Formerly, shepherds collected nestlings for food, and egg collectors have raided burrows. Currently, the main threats continue to be predation of eggs and chicks by rats, and of nesting adults by feral cats, although at much reduced levels due to trapping.

Zino&#x27;s petrel is protected under the EU&#x27;s Wild Birds Directive, and its breeding sites lie within the Parque Natural da Madeira national park. Following the purchase of about of land around the main breeding site, all livestock has been removed from the breeding areas, allowing the vegetation to recover, although breeding still only occurs on ledges that were never accessible to grazing animals. The research and predator control by the Freira Conservation Project and the national park which started in 1986 was expanded in 2001 with additional EU funding. The increase in productivity (29 chicks fledged in 2004) meant that this species was downgraded from critically endangered to endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2004. Its population appeared to be stable or increasing slightly up to the summer of 2010.

A disaster struck the colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire swept through the breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. The action plan also included the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the vegetation recover, and the use of anti-erosion materials. By 2018, the colony had recovered and was stable at 160 adults.

<doc id="386074" wikidata="Q315170" url="?curid=386074" title="Seán O'Casey">
<text>Seán O&#x27;Casey ( ; born John Casey; 30 March 1880 – 18 September 1964) was an Irish dramatist and memoirist. A committed socialist, he was the first Irish playwright of note to write about the Dublin working classes.

== Early life ==
O&#x27;Casey was born at 85 Upper Dorset Street, Dublin, as John Casey, the son of Michael Casey, a mercantile clerk (who worked for the Irish Church Missions), and Susan Archer. His parents were Protestants and he was a member of the Church of Ireland, baptised on 28 July 1880 in St. Mary&#x27;s parish, confirmed at St John the Baptist Church in Clontarf, and an active member of St. Barnabas&#x27; Church on Sheriff Street until his mid-20s, when he drifted away from the church. There is a church called &#x27;Saint Burnupus&#x27; in his play &quot;Red Roses For Me&quot;.

O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s father died when Seán was just six years of age, leaving a family of thirteen. The family lived a peripatetic life thereafter, moving from house to house around north Dublin. As a child, he suffered from poor eyesight, which interfered somewhat with his early education, but O&#x27;Casey taught himself to read and write by the age of thirteen.

He left school at fourteen and worked at a variety of jobs, including a nine-year period as a railwayman on the GNR. O&#x27;Casey worked in Eason&#x27;s for a short while, in the newspaper distribution business, but was sacked for not taking off his cap when collecting his wage packet.

From the early 1890s, O&#x27;Casey and his elder brother, Archie, put on performances of plays by Dion Boucicault and William Shakespeare in the family home. He also got a small part in Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;The Shaughraun&quot; in the Mechanics&#x27; Theatre, which stood on the site of what was to be the Abbey Theatre.

== Politics ==
As his interest in the Irish nationalist cause grew, O&#x27;Casey joined the Gaelic League in 1906 and learned the Irish language. At this time, he Gaelicised his name from John Casey to Seán Ó Cathasaigh. He also learned to play the Uilleann pipes and was a founder and secretary of the St. Laurence O&#x27;Toole Pipe Band. He joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and became involved in the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, which had been established by Jim Larkin to represent the interests of the unskilled labourers who inhabited the Dublin tenements. He participated in the Dublin lock-out but was blacklisted and could not find steady work for some time.

In March 1914, he became General Secretary of Larkin&#x27;s Irish Citizen Army, which would soon be run by James Connolly. On 24 July 1914 he resigned from the ICA, after his proposal to ban dual membership in both the ICA and the Irish Volunteers was rejected.

One of his first satirical ballads, &quot;The Grand Oul&#x27; Dame Britannia&quot;, was published in &quot;The Workers&#x27; Republic&quot; on 15 January 1916 under his penname An Gall Fada.
== After the Easter Rising ==
In 1917, his friend Thomas Ashe died in a hunger strike and it inspired him to write. He wrote two laments: one in verse and a longer one in prose. Ballads authored around this time by O&#x27;Casey featured in the two editions of &quot;Songs of the Wren&quot;, published by Fergus O&#x27;Connor in 1918; these included &quot;The Man from the Daily Mail&quot;, which, along with &quot;The Grand Oul&#x27; Dame Britannia&quot;, became Irish rebel music staples. A common theme was opposition to the possible introduction of conscription in Ireland by the British government during World War I.

He spent the next five years writing plays. In 1918, when both his sister and mother died (in January and September, respectively), the St Laurence O&#x27;Toole National Club commissioned him to write the play &quot;The Frost in the Flower&quot;. He had been in the St Laurence O&#x27;Toole Pipe Band and played on the hurling team. The club declined to put the play on out of fear that its satirical treatment of several parishioners would cause resentment. O&#x27;Casey then submitted the play to the Abbey Theatre, which also rejected it but encouraged him to continue writing. Eventually, O&#x27;Casey expanded the play to three acts and retitled it &quot;The Harvest Festival&quot;.

O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s first accepted play, &quot;The Shadow of a Gunman&quot;, was performed at the Abbey Theatre in 1923. This was the beginning of a relationship that was to be fruitful for both theatre and dramatist but which ended in some bitterness.

The play deals with the impact of revolutionary politics on Dublin&#x27;s slums and their inhabitants, and is understood to be set in Mountjoy Square, where he lived during the 1916 Easter Rising. It was followed by &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; (1924) and &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; (1926). The former deals with the effect of the Irish Civil War on the working class poor of the city, while the latter is set in Dublin in 1916 around the Easter Rising. Both plays deal realistically with the rhetoric and dangers of Irish patriotism, with tenement life, self-deception, and survival; they are tragi-comedies in which violent death throws into relief the blustering masculine bravado of characters such as Jack Boyle and Joxer Daly in &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; and the heroic resilience of Juno herself or of Bessie Burgess in &quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot;. &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; became a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock.

&quot;The Plough and the Stars&quot; was not well received by the Abbey audience and resulted in scenes reminiscent of the riots that greeted J. M. Synge&#x27;s &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot; in 1907. There was a riot reported on the fourth night of the show. His depiction of sex and religion offended even some of the actors, who refused to speak their lines. The full-scale riot occurred partly because the play was thought to be an attack on the men in the rising and partly in protest in opposition to the animated appearance of a prostitute in Act 2. W. B. Yeats got onto the stage and roared at the audience: &quot;You have disgraced yourselves again.&quot; The takings of the play were substantial compared with the previous week. O&#x27;Casey gave up his job and became a full-time writer.

After the incident, even though the play was well liked by most of the Abbey goers, Liam O&#x27;Flaherty, Austin Clarke and F. R. Higgins launched an attack against it in the press. O&#x27;Casey believed it was an attack on Yeats, that they were using O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s play to berate Yeats.

In 1952 he appeared in a play by Irish playwright Teresa Deevy, &quot;The Wild Goose&quot;, in which he played the part of Father Ryan. O&#x27;Casey was involved in numerous productions with the Abbey; these can be found in the Abbey Archives.

== England ==
While in London to receive the Hawthornden Prize and supervise the West End production of &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;, O&#x27;Casey fell in love with Eileen Carey. The couple were married in 1927 and remained in London until 1938, when they moved to Totnes.

In 1928, W. B. Yeats rejected O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s fourth play, &quot;The Silver Tassie&quot; for the Abbey. It was an attack on imperialist wars and the suffering they cause. The Abbey refused to perform it. The premier production was funded by Charles B. Cochran, who took only eighteen months to put it on stage. It was put on at the Apollo Theatre but lasted for only twenty-six performances. It was directed by Raymond Massey, starred Charles Laughton and with an Act II set design by Augustus John. George Bernard Shaw and Lady Gregory had a favourable opinion of the show.

Denis Johnston, who knew O&#x27;Casey and spent time with him in London in the 1920s, is certain that the Abbey was right not to stage &quot;The Silver Tassie&quot;: &quot;Its expressionist second act was at that time far beyond the scope of the Abbey Theatre.&quot; A year later Johnston&#x27;s own &quot;The Old Lady Says &quot;No!&quot;&quot; was similarly rejected, for the same reason. Nevertheless O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s resentment over this persisted for many years.
The plays O&#x27;Casey wrote after this included the darkly allegorical &quot;Within the Gates&quot; (1934), which is set within the gates of a busy city park based on London&#x27;s Hyde Park. Although it was highly controversial, Eugene O&#x27;Neill responded positively to it. The play was originally going to be a film script for Alfred Hitchcock. O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s widow described it in her memoir, &quot;Sean&quot; (1971):Originally he had imagined it as a film in which everything, from flower-beds to uniforms, would be stylised. Beginning at dawn and ending at midnight, to the soft chime of Big Ben in the distance, it would be &quot;geometrical and emotional, the emotions of the living characters to be shown against their own patterns and the patterns of the Park.&quot; Having got so far, he wrote to Alfred Hitchcock, and when Hitchcock and his wife dined with us Sean explained his ideas to an apparently responsive hearer. Hitchcock and he talked excitedly. They parted on the same terms, with the prospect of another immediate meeting, and Sean never heard again.

The play was unsuccessful in Northern Ireland and was not produced in the south until 2010. In the autumn of 1934, O&#x27;Casey went to the United States to visit the New York City production of &quot;Within the Gates&quot;, which he admired greatly. It was directed by actor Melvyn Douglas and starred Lillian Gish. This is when he befriended Eugene O&#x27;Neill, Sherwood Anderson and George Jean Nathan.

&quot;The Star Turns Red&quot; (1940) is a four-act political allegory in which the Star of Bethlehem turns red. The story follows Big Red (who was based on O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s friend, James Larkin) who is a trade-union leader. The union takes over the unnamed country despite the ruthless efforts of the Saffron Shirts, a fascist organisation openly supported by the Roman Catholic hierarchy of the country. It was staged by the Unity Theatre in London during 1940 (later, in 1978 by the Abbey in Dublin).

&quot;Purple Dust&quot; (1943) follows two wealthy, materialistic English stockbrokers who buy an ancient Irish mansion and attempt to restore it with their wrong notions of Tudor customs and taste. They try to impose upon a community with vastly different customs and lifestyles that are much closer to ancient Gaelic ways and are against such false values.

The Englishmen set their opposing standards against those represented by the men employed to renovate the house. In the resulting confrontation the English are satirised and in the end disappointed when a symbolic storm destroys their dream of resettling the old into the present. The hint that is enforced by the conclusion is that the little heap of purple dust that remains will be swept away by the rising winds of change, like the residue of pompous imperialism that abides in Ireland. The show has been compared to Shaw&#x27;s &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot;, which was one of O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s favourites, but aside from a few similarities, there are no real grounds for comparison.

He also wrote &quot;Red Roses for Me&quot; (1943), which saw him move away from his early style in favour of more expressionistic means and overtly socialist content to his writing. It went up at Dublin&#x27;s Olympia Theatre (which was the first one produced in Ireland in seventeen years). It would move on to London in 1946, where O&#x27;Casey himself was able to see it. This was the first show of his own he saw since &quot;Within The Gates&quot; in 1934.

&quot;Oak Leaves and Lavender&quot; (1945) is a propaganda play commemorating the Battle of Britain and Britain&#x27;s heroism in the anti-Nazi crusade. It takes place in a manor with shadowy 18th-century figures commenting on the present.

These plays have never had the same critical or popular success as the early trilogy. After the Second World War he wrote &quot;Cock-a-Doodle Dandy&quot; (1949), which is perhaps his most beautiful and exciting work. From &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Bonfire&quot; (1955) O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s late plays are studies on the common life in Ireland, &quot;Irish microcosmos&quot;, like &quot;The Drums of Father Ned&quot; (1958).

His play &quot;The Drums of Father Ned&quot; was supposed to go up at the 1958 Dublin Theatre Festival, but the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid, refused to give his blessing (it has been assumed because works of both James Joyce and O&#x27;Casey were in the festival). After Joyce&#x27;s play was quietly dropped, massive changes were required for &quot;The Drums of Father Ned&quot;, a devious way to get O&#x27;Casey to drop. After this, Samuel Beckett withdrew his mime piece in protest.

== Later life ==

In 1959, O&#x27;Casey gave his blessing to a musical adaptation of &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; by American composer Marc Blitzstein. The musical, retitled &quot;Juno&quot;, was a commercial failure, closing after only 16 Broadway performances. It was also panned by some critics as being too &quot;dark&quot; to be an appropriate musical, a genre then almost invariably associated with light comedy. However, the music, which survives in a cast album made before the show opened, has since been regarded as some of Blitzstein&#x27;s best work. Although endorsed by the then 79-year-old O&#x27;Casey, he did not contribute to the production or even see it during its brief run. Despite general agreement on the brilliance of the underlying material, the musical has defied all efforts to mount any successful revival.

Also in 1959, George Devine produced &quot;Cock-a-Doodle Dandy&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre and it was also successful at the Edinburgh International Festival and had a West End run.

His eightieth birthday occurred in 1960, and to celebrate, David Krause and Robert Hogan wrote full-length studies. The Mermaid Theatre in London launched the &quot;O&#x27;Casey Festival&quot; in 1962, which in turn made more theatre establishments put on his works, mostly in Britain and Germany. It is in the late years that O&#x27;Casey put his creative energy into his six-volume &quot;Autobiography.&quot;

On 18 September 1964 at the age of 84, O&#x27;Casey died of a heart attack, in Torquay, Devon. He was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium.

In 1965, his autobiography &quot;Mirror in My House&quot; (the umbrella title under which the six autobiographies he published from 1939 to 1956 were republished, in two large volumes, in 1956) was turned into a film based on his life called &quot;Young Cassidy&quot;. The film was directed by Jack Cardiff (and John Ford) featuring Rod Taylor (as O&#x27;Casey), Flora Robson, Maggie Smith, Julie Christie, Edith Evans and Michael Redgrave.

== Personal life ==
O&#x27;Casey was married to Irish actress Eileen Carey Reynolds (1903–1995) from 1927 to his death. The couple had three children: two sons, Breon and Níall (who died in 1957 of leukaemia), and a daughter, Shivaun.

== Archival collection ==
In 2005, David H. Greene donated a collection of letters he received from O&#x27;Casey from 1944 to 1962 to the Fales Library at New York University. Also in the collection are two letters written by Eileen O&#x27;Casey and one letter addressed to Catherine Greene, David Greene&#x27;s spouse.

O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s papers are held in the New York Public Library, the Cornell University Library, the University of California, Los Angeles Library System, the University of London Library, the National Library of Ireland, Colby College, Boston College and the Fales Library.

== Legacy ==
In Dublin, a foot bridge on the Liffey is named after him, as is Sean O&#x27;Casey Avenue in Summerhill and &#x27;Sean O&#x27;Casey Community Centre&#x27; in East Wall.

There is a plaque dedicated to O&#x27;Casey at the site of his former house on Dorset Street, Dublin and also at the building where he stayed in a flat in Wandsworth, London in England.

<doc id="386075" wikidata="Q1264430" url="?curid=386075" title="Black-capped petrel">
<text>The black-capped petrel (Pterodroma hasitata), also known as the diablotín, is a small seabird native to the West Indies in the genus &quot;Pterodroma&quot;. It is a long-winged petrel with a grey-brown back and wings, with a white nape and rump. Underparts are mainly white apart from a black cap (that in some individuals extends to cover the eye) and some dark underwing markings. It picks food items such as squid from the ocean surface.

==Description==
The black-capped petrel is large compared to other gadfly petrels, with a length of about 16 inches (40.5 cm) and 37 inches (94 cm) wingspan. The most similar species within its range is the Bermuda petrel, which is smaller and has a narrower white rump patch and an extensive gray cowl. The great shearwater is also superficially similar. The critically endangered or possibly extinct Jamaica petrel (&quot;P. caribbaea&quot;) was a related dark form. The local Spanish name, &quot;Diablotín&quot;, means &quot;little devil&quot; because of its night-time habits and odd-sounding mating calls, which suggested to locals the presence of evil spirits in the dark. The petrel will occasionally utter other croaks and sounds while foraging at sea.

The black-capped petrel is nocturnal on its breeding grounds, possibly to avoid predation by gulls, hawks or crows. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the nest burrow.

==Taxonomy==
There are two variants of the black-capped petrel; a dark or black-faced form, and a light or white-faced form. Genetic evidence of divergence suggests that these two color morphs represent distinct breeding populations. However, it is unclear whether these populations represent separate species or subspecies. Intermediate birds showing features of both populations are known to exist.

==Distribution and habitat==

===Range===
Although this seabird once bred on steep mountainsides of the Greater Antilles, only three confirmed breeding areas remain in the high mountains of Hispaniola (in Sierra de Bahoruco and Valle Nuevo National Park in the Dominican Republic, and Massif de la Selle and Massif de la Hotte in Haiti). In 2015, birds were also confirmed nesting on a second island (Dominica), which had long been suspected given historical nesting there. A mountain peak where it formerly bred in Haiti (and another in Dominica) is still named &quot;Mont Diablotin&quot; in reference to the &quot;little devil&quot; moniker.

The warm waters of the Gulf Stream serve as the primary foraging area for this species. Most birds during the non-breeding season are concentrated off the United States coast between Florida and North Carolina, though they have been known to wander far to the north and east toward Europe. The species has been seen year-round in the Gulf Stream. The birds that visit these waters during the breeding season either represent non-breeders or are making long foraging trips away from the nest. The black-capped petrel is almost strictly pelagic away from the breeding grounds and is known to join loose flocks with other seabirds such as shearwaters and terns.

===Nesting===
Like other gadfly petrels, the black-capped petrel nests in burrows in remote highland areas of islands. These burrows are typically located on forested cliffs, and are very difficult to locate. They visit burrows at night, so as to avoid detection by predators. Eggs are typically laid in January, which will subsequently hatch sometime in March. Fledglings will then depart the nest in either June or July.

==Conservation==
The species, once abundant in the Caribbean, has declined significantly and is now one of the most endangered seabirds in the North Atlantic along with the Bermuda petrel. In the early 20th century, there was speculation that the black-capped petrel was extinct or nearing extinction, but more current population estimates range from 2,000 to 4,000 individuals. In 1963, an expedition led by David Wingate discovered 11 breeding colonies in Haiti. Most of the threats facing the black-capped petrel are on its nesting grounds, where causes for its demise include habitat loss, introduced predators, and direct harvesting by humans. Human predation appears to have become more limited in scope than in historic times, due in part to the species&#x27; current scarcity. Deforestation from wildfires and direct human use have likely decreased the amount of suitable nesting habitat available to the black-capped petrel. This is especially true in Haiti, which has suffered severe loss of forest cover in recent years.

Current conservation plans for the petrel largely involve preserving forest cover around known nesting areas as well as monitoring and searching for burrows. There are also concerns that hydrocarbon exploration off of the Southeast United States could negatively affect the species&#x27; continued survival. In 2018, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the black-capped petrel as threatened. On 1 May 2023, a new 30-day comment period was opened due to concerns that threats to the species are greater than previously assessed.

<text>The Jamaican petrel (Pterodroma caribbaea) is a small possibly extinct seabird in the gadfly petrel genus, &quot;Pterodroma&quot;. It is related to the black-capped petrel (&quot;P. hasitata&quot;).

==Conservation==
This species was last collected in 1879, and was searched for without success between 1996 and 2000. However, it cannot yet be classified as extinct because nocturnal petrels are notoriously difficult to record, and it may still occur on Dominica and Guadeloupe. If it is extinct, the most likely cause is due to predation by introduced mongooses and rats.

==Parasites==
Several species of lice are known to have parasitized the Jamaica and black-capped petrels. If the former is extinct, one of these lice, the phtilopterid &quot;Saemundssonia jamaicensis&quot; may be coextinct, as it has not been found on other birds.

==History==
===1860s origins===
John Lewis opened a drapery shop at 132 Oxford Street, London, in 1864. Born in Shepton Mallet in Somerset in 1836, he had been apprenticed at 14 to a linen draper in Wells. He came to London in 1856 and worked as a salesman for Peter Robinson, an Oxford Street draper, rising to be his silk buyer. In 1864, he declined Robinson&#x27;s offer of a partnership, and rented his own premises on the north side of Oxford Street, on part of the site now occupied by the department store which bears his name. There he sold silk and woollen cloth and haberdashery. His retailing philosophy was to buy good quality merchandise and sell it at a modest &#x27;mark up&#x27;. Although he carried a wide range of merchandise, he was less concerned about displaying it and never advertised it. His skill lay in sourcing the goods he sold, and most mornings he would go to the City of London, accompanied by a man with a hand barrow. Later he would make trips to Paris to buy silks.

Lewis spurned holidays and games and devoted himself entirely to the business, which was successful. He invested the money he made from it in residential and small retail properties, many of which he never visited. He expanded the Oxford Street business by renting neighbouring properties on Oxford Street and then along Holles Street, and gradually moved into other classes of merchandise: first the new area of ready-made women&#x27;s apparel, and later children&#x27;s wear and furniture. He never held &#x27;sales&#x27;, saying that he was intent on building a sound, permanent business.

In 1884, aged 48, Lewis married Eliza Baker, a schoolmistress with a university education, who was 18 years his junior. They set up home in a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, for which Lewis made up the name Spedan Tower after his aunt, Ann Speed, and when Eliza bore a son in 1885, he was called John Spedan Lewis. A second son, Oswald Lewis, was born in 1887. After Westminster School, both sons joined Lewis in the business, and he gave each of them a quarter share of it on their twenty-first birthdays.

===1900s family disagreements===
There was constant quarrelling between Lewis and his sons. By 1909, Oswald wanted out, and Lewis senior reluctantly agreed to buy back Oswald&#x27;s quarter share of the business for £50,000 (equivalent to about £4.5 million in 2010). Oswald went to read Law at Oxford, qualified as a barrister, and became a cavalry officer in 1914. He was injured and discharged in 1916, whereupon he accepted an invitation from his father to rejoin the business.

Lewis had several run-ins with Lord Howard de Walden, his Oxford Street landlord, and in 1903 he spent three weeks in Brixton Prison for defying a court order obtained by de Walden. In 1911, de Walden sued him for libel. Lewis was found guilty, but the jury awarded damages of just a farthing.

In 1906, Lewis bought a controlling interest in the Sloane Square-based business Peter Jones Limited, the eponymous founder of which had died the previous year. Lewis walked from Oxford Street with the £20,000 purchase price in banknotes.

===1910s===
In the next 13 years, the Peter Jones business was unprofitable – no dividends were paid to Lewis and the external shareholders and in desperation, in 1914 Lewis appointed his son Spedan as chairman of Peter Jones. This gave Spedan Lewis complete control, and he decided that the underlying problem was that the staff had no incentive to do a good day&#x27;s work because their own interests were not in line with those of the business. He shortened their working day and instituted a system of commission for each department, paying selling staff amounts based on turnover. He held regular meetings at which staff could air any grievances directly with him. In 1916, after a disagreement with his father, Spedan Lewis exchanged his 25% interest in the Oxford Street business for Lewis&#x27;s shares in Peter Jones Limited. He made improvements in staff conditions, including granting a third week&#x27;s paid holiday each year. He had hot and cold running water installed in the staff bedrooms over the shop. In 1918, he started publishing a fortnightly newspaper telling staff how the business was faring. In 1919, he instituted a staff council meeting, the first decision of which was that staff should be paid weekly instead of four-weekly. The business prospered: there was a profit of £20,000 in 1920. Spedan Lewis&#x27;s radical idea was that the profits generated by the business should not be paid solely to shareholders as a reward for their capital. Shareholders should receive a reasonable but limited return, and labour should be the recipient of the excess. His concept of &#x27;fairer shares&#x27; involved sharing gain, knowledge, and power. In 1920, Spedan started distributing Peter Jones preference shares to staff, who were referred to as &quot;Partners&quot;.

===1920s===
The early 1920s were not successful for Peter Jones. Dividends on preference shares, many of which were held by employees, were not paid. In 1924, there was a reconciliation between John Lewis and Spedan Lewis. Trade at Oxford Street had fared better, and John Lewis made a cash injection into the Sloane Square business.

In 1925, Spedan Lewis devised the slogan &#x27;never knowingly undersold&#x27; at Peter Jones. Intended mainly as a control on sourcing merchandise, it also meant that customers could shop knowing that they were not paying more at Peter Jones than they could buy identical goods for at other stores. This principle, which was refined several times, most notably to exclude retailers who trade only online and to include extended insurance and delivery charges when comparing prices, was honoured until August 2022, when it was replaced with a general commitment to providing competitive value on their own-label merchandise.

By 1926, Lewis senior was 90, Spedan was impatient to gain control of John Lewis in Oxford Street so that he could implement his radical ideas there, and Oswald again wanted out. Without telling their father, Spedan took out a bank loan and bought out Oswald&#x27;s inheritance. After going around the world, Oswald embarked on a political career, becoming Conservative Party MP for Colchester in 1929, and holding the seat until 1945. Spedan Lewis became the sole owner in the Oxford Street business after John Lewis died aged 92 in 1928.

In 1929, Spedan Lewis signed a deed of settlement, which transferred shares in John Lewis &amp; Co. Limited and Peter Jones Limited to trustees. The profits of the combined business would be distributed to its employees, either as cash or as fixed-interest stock in the new company: John Lewis Partnership Limited.

===1930s expansion===
In 1933, JLP started acquiring other retail businesses, buying Jessop &amp; Son of Nottingham, and Lance &amp; Lance of Weston-super-Mare. In 1934, it acquired Knight &amp; Lee in Southsea, and Tyrrell &amp; Green in Southampton. It also started rebuilding Peter Jones to a modern design. In 1937, it bought Waitrose, which operated ten counter-service grocery shops in London and the home counties.

===1940s and the Second World War===
The biggest acquisition came in 1940 when JLP paid £30,000 for Selfridge Provincial Stores Limited, which owned 16 shops: John Barnes in Hampstead, Blinkhorn &amp; Son in Gloucester and Stroud, Bon Marché in Brixton, Buckleys in Harrogate, A H Bull in Reading, Caleys in Windsor, Cole Brothers in Sheffield, Holdrons in Peckham, Jones Brothers in Holloway, George Henry Lee in Liverpool, Pratts in Streatham, Quin &amp; Axten in Brixton, Robert Sayle in Cambridge, Thomsons in Peterborough and Trewin Brothers in Watford, substantially increasing the size of the business.

The Second World War took its toll, and several stores were damaged by bombing, notably the &#x27;west house&#x27; of John Lewis in Oxford Street (on the west side of Holles Street), which was lost completely in September 1940.

===1950s===
In 1950, Spedan Lewis executed a second deed of settlement, which passed ownership of JLP to trustees to hold for the benefit of those who worked in the business. He continued to manage it as if he were still the owner, saying in 1957 that it was necessary to concentrate management in one pair of hands.

Spedan Lewis also retained for himself the right to choose his successor when he retired on his 70th birthday in 1955. He had originally intended that Michael Watkins, his right-hand man for many years, would succeed him as chairman, but Watkins died in 1950. Spedan asked his son, Edward Lewis, if he would fill the role, but he declined. Spedan appointed a loyal, long-serving lieutenant, Bernard Miller, but expressed the hope that in due course Edward would succeed Miller as chairman. In the event, Miller was succeeded by Peter Lewis, the son of Oswald Lewis.

In 1953 JLP sold several small stores but acquired two large ones: Heelas in Reading and Bainbridge in Newcastle upon Tyne. The rebuilt store on Oxford Street was reopened in 1960, and the sculpture &quot;Winged Figure&quot; by Barbara Hepworth was added in 1963.

===2000s===
To accommodate national advertising, in 2002, the company began the process of renaming department stores not branded as John Lewis (Tyrrell &amp; Green, Heelas, etc.) with the nationally recognisable name. Peter Jones in London remains the sole exception to this policy. The company experimented with smaller format stores, adding 12 At Home shops and 2 Convenience-driven stores, alongside 3 more full-line department stores (Leeds, Stratford, Birmingham).

John Lewis faced a series of strikes in 2012 and 2013 by cleaners, who had been outsourced, regarding pay.

The group made its first-ever half-year operating loss of £26 million in the first half of 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 16 loss-making John Lewis stores were closed.

=== Senior leadership ===
The company is overseen by the chairman, who is responsible for the overall success of the business. 

==== Chairmen ====
# John Spedan Lewis (1929–1955)
# Sir Bernard Miller (1955–1972)
# Peter Lewis (1972–1993)
# Sir Stuart Hampson (1993–2007)
# Sir Charlie Mayfield (2007–2020)
# Dame Sharon White (2020–2024)
# Jason Tarry (since September 2024)

==== Chief executives ====
In March 2023, a chief executive was hired for the first time, making Nish Kankiwala responsible for day-to-day operations of the partnership as delegated by the chairman. However, this role was eliminated in October 2024 by new chairman Jason Tarry, with Kankiwala due to complete his two-year contract and step down in March 2025.

==Employee representation within JLP==
The highest level of the JLP&#x27;s democratic structure is the Partnership Council, a directly elected body of 58 Partners who both represent opinions from across the Partnership and hold the Chairman to account for their running of the business. Partnership Councillors are company insiders with voting rights, and the only body within the company&#x27;s governance structures with the power to remove the Chairman from office. Biannually the Council conducts a &quot;Holding to Account&quot; session where the Chairman fields questions from representatives in an open meeting, following which a vote is held which indicates whether or not Councillors support the Chairman&#x27;s leadership and the progress of the business.

Further to this structure, the Partnership Council elects three directors to the &quot;Partnership Board&quot;. The three Elected Directors join the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Executive Director Finance, and two further Non-Executive Directors to form the Partnership Board. The Council also elects three individuals to act as Trustees of the John Lewis Partnership.

Employees of JLP usually receive an annual bonus, akin to a share of the profit. It is calculated as a percentage of salary, with the same percentage awarded to all employees. The bonus is dependent on the profitability of JLP each year, varying historically between 5% and 20% of Partners&#x27; annual salaries, but falling to 3% in 2019 in light of tough trading conditions. The annual bonus dropped to 2% in 2020 and it was confirmed that no bonus would be paid in 2021 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the first time since 1953 that the bonus had not been paid. The bonus returned in 2022 paid at a rate of 3%.

In 1999, in response to a fall in profits, there were calls from some employees for the business to undertake an initial public offering and float on the stock market. If this had gone through, each employee stood to receive a windfall averaging £100,000. A company-wide ballot was held regarding the matter which did not approve the proposals.

In 2023, the early stages of a plan to sell shares were explored but no action was taken.

==Retail operations==

===John Lewis &amp; Partners===
In 2012, the John Lewis division operated 30 full-line department stores, one John Lewis Click and Commute at St Pancras railway station, one John Lewis convenience store at Heathrow Airport, 10 John Lewis at Home Stores, and a web store. The stores are in a mixture of city centre and out-of-town shopping centre locations. The flagship Oxford Street store in London remains the largest John Lewis outlet in the UK.

&#x27;John Lewis at Home&#x27; stores cater for areas which have no large John Lewis department store near them. The first store opened in Poole in October 2009. They are around a third the size of a normal department store, and have both Home and Electrical departments with services such as a cafe and &#x27;click and collect&#x27; also available. A new &#x27;flexible format&#x27; store was trialled in Exeter in 2012, with a full line of stock in a smaller physical store, relying heavily on &#x27;click and collect&#x27; or next day delivery, both in-store and to homes.

===Peter Jones===

Peter Jones is a large department store in central London. It is a store of JLP and is located on Sloane Square, at the junction of King&#x27;s Road and Sloane Street, in the Chelsea district, close to the Belgravia and Knightsbridge districts. Peter Jones was founded as an independent store but was bought by John Lewis, owner of the eponymous store in Oxford Street, in 1905. In 1929 Lewis&#x27;s son, John Spedan Lewis, who then owned both businesses, combined them into a single business.

===Waitrose &amp; Partners===
JLP also owns Waitrose &amp; Partners, an upmarket supermarket chain that had 332 branches and 78,000 employees as of early 2021. Waitrose trades mainly in London and the south of England, and was originally formed by Wallace Waite, Arthur Rose, and David Taylor. The company was taken over by JLP in 1937.

==Other services and operations==
===John Lewis Finance===
In June 2004, JLP launched their own credit card, branded Partnership Card, provided by HSBC UK. The card was launched to complement the existing John Lewis and Waitrose account cards. It was announced in May 2022 that the white-label agreement with HSBC would end later that year, with new and existing Partnership Card accounts migrated to a reshaped service run by British financial services company NewDay.

The company has provided insurance products since it launched Greenbee in October 2006. Later, the Greenbee brand was retired and the services rebranded John Lewis Finance. Initially, it offered home, travel, wedding and events insurance as well as a travel and tickets service. It subsequently expanded to offer other services including car insurance and policies for second homes. John Lewis Finance later branched out into providing pet insurance, as well as creating John Lewis Investments, in partnership with Nutmeg.

In October 2021, John Lewis Finance released a home insurance advertisement showing a boy in make-up and a dress vandalising his house. The advertisement was banned by the Financial Conduct Authority as misleading, because the insurance plan did not include deliberate damage, as portrayed.

===Telecoms===
John Lewis offered broadband and home telephone services via a white-label agreement with Plusnet. The service closed to new customers in October 2022 and, following this, to existing customers when they reached the end of their contract.

===Manufacturing===
JLP currently operates one manufacturing business, Herbert Parkinson, in Darwen, Lancashire. This company, established as a weaver of jacquard fabrics in 1934, was acquired by the Partnership in 1953. Herbert Parkinson currently produces John Lewis own-brand fabrics and curtains as well as filled furnishing products such as cushions and pillows. The company operates a wholesale business to outside customers in addition to supplying John Lewis branches.

Until September 2007, the Partnership also owned two further textile production businesses: Carlisle-based printer Stead McAlpin (founded c. 1875, 200 workers) and Haslingden, Lancashire-based weaver J. H. Birtwistle.

The manufacture and sale of furnishing textiles was organised by the business Cavendish Textiles, produced under the trade name of &#x27;Jonelle&#x27; from 1937, dropped in 2000 in favour of &#x27;John Lewis&#x27;. Designers included many associated with Heal&#x27;s, such as Lucienne Day and Pat Albeck, as well as Jacqueline Groag.

==Ocado==

John Lewis Partnership helped finance the creation of Ocado, an independent online supermarket, and later transferred its interest to its pension fund, which owned 29% of Ocado. The pension fund fully divested itself of its final 10.4% share ownership in February 2011 for £152 million, which represented a total profit from the company&#x27;s investment in Ocado of about £220 million. In September 2020, the Partnership&#x27;s relationship with Ocado came to an end.

<doc id="386086" wikidata="Q1424486" url="?curid=386086" title="Common grackle">
<text>The common grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) is a species of large icterid bird found in large numbers through much of North America. First described in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, the common grackle has three subspecies. Adult common grackles have a long and dark bill, pale yellow eyes, and a long tail. Adults often have an iridescent appearance on their head, especially males. Common grackles can be found widely across North America east of the Rocky Mountains.

==Taxonomy==
The common grackle was first described in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, as &quot;Gracula quiscula&quot;. It was assigned to the genus &quot;Quiscalus&quot; by French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in his 1816 &quot;Dictionnaire d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot;.

Three subspecies are recognized:

*the Florida grackle (&quot;Q. q. quiscula&quot;) (Linnaeus 1758), the nominate subspecies
*the purple grackle (&quot;Q. q. stonei&quot;) (Chapman, 1935)
*the bronzed grackle (&quot;Q. q. versicolor&quot;) (Vieillot, 1816)

==Description==
Adult common grackles measure from in length, span across the wings, and weigh . Common grackles are less sexually dimorphic than larger grackle species, but the differences between the sexes can still be noticeable. The male, which averages , is larger than the female, at an average of . Adults have a long, dark bill, pale yellowish eyes, and a long tail; their feathers appear black with purple, green, or blue iridescence on the head, and primarily bronze sheen in the body plumage. Adult females, beyond being smaller, are usually less iridescent; their tails in particular are shorter, and unlike the males, do not keel (display a longitudinal ridge) in flight and are brown with no purple or blue gloss. Juveniles are brown with dark brown eyes.

When grackles are in a group, they are referred to as a &quot;plague&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The breeding habitat is open and semiopen areas across North America east of the Rocky Mountains. The nest is a well-concealed cup in dense trees (particularly pine) or shrubs, usually near water; sometimes, the common grackle nests in cavities or in man-made structures. It often nests in colonies, some being quite large. Bird houses are also a suitable nesting site. Four to seven eggs are in a clutch.

This bird is a permanent resident in much of its range. Northern birds migrate in flocks to the Southeastern United States. The distribution of the common grackle is largely explained by annual mean temperature, and the species has expanded its range by greater than three-fold since the last glacial maximum, approximately 22,000 years ago.

==Ecology and behavior==

=== Foraging and diet ===

The common grackle forages on the ground, in shallow water, or in shrubs; it may steal food from other birds. It is omnivorous, eating insects, minnows, frogs, eggs, berries, seeds, grain, and even small birds and rodents. Grackles at outdoor eating areas often wait eagerly until someone drops some food. They rush forward and try to grab it, often snatching food out of the beak of another bird. Grackles prefer to eat from the ground at bird feeders, making scattered seed an excellent choice of food for them. Grackles can be regularly seen foraging for insects, especially after a lawn trimming.

Grackles have a unique adaptation in the keel within their bill which allows them to crack and cut hard nuts or kernels. The keel projects downward from the horny palate and is sharper and more abrupt anterior. It extends below the level of the tomium and is used in a sawing motion to score open acorns or dried kernels. Larger adductor muscles within their jaw compared to those of other icterids make this adaptation even more useful for opening hard seeds and acorns.

Along with some other species of grackles, the common grackle is known to practice &quot;anting&quot;, rubbing insects on its feathers possibly to apply liquids such as formic acid secreted by the insects.

=== Vocals ===
The grackle&#x27;s song is particularly harsh, especially when these birds, in a flock, are calling. Songs vary from year-round &quot;chewink chewink&quot; to a more complex breeding season &quot;ooo whew, whew, whew, whew, whew&quot; call that gets faster and faster and ends with a loud &quot;crewhewwhew!&quot; It also occasionally sounds like a power line buzzing. The grackle can also mimic the sounds of other birds or even humans, though not as precisely as the mockingbird, which is known to share its habitat in the Southeastern United States.
=== Breeding ===
In the breeding season, males tip their heads back and fluff up feathers to display and keep other males away. This same behavior is used as a defensive posture to attempt to intimidate predators. Male common grackles are less aggressive toward one another, and more cooperative and social, than the larger boat-tailed grackle species.

==Relationship with humans==
The range of this bird expanded west as forests were cleared. In some areas, it is now considered a pest by farmers because of its large numbers and fondness for grain. Despite a currently robust population, a recent study by the National Audubon Society of data from the Christmas Bird Count indicated that populations had declined by 61% to a population of 73 million from historic highs of over 190 million birds. As a result, it is now classified by the IUCN as Near Threatened.

Unlike many birds, the common grackle benefits from the expansion of human populations due to its resourceful and opportunistic nature. Common grackles are considered to be a serious threat to crops by some, and are notoriously difficult to control; this usually requires the use of hawks or similar large birds of prey.

== Proposed magnetoreceptivity ==
Though the exact mechanism is poorly understood, several studies have examined the ability of the common grackle to interpret the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field—or in this case, the variability of it. The common grackle (like most of its &quot;Quiscalus&quot; relatives) has been found to be attuned to a dynamic magnetic field to a scientifically significant degree.

<doc id="386090" wikidata="Q771734" url="?curid=386090" title="Waitrose">
<text>Waitrose Limited, trading as Waitrose &amp; Partners, is a British supermarket chain, founded in 1904 as Waite, Rose &amp; Taylor, later shortened to Waitrose. In 1937, it was acquired by the John Lewis Partnership, the UK&#x27;s largest employee-owned business, which continues to operate the brand. The company&#x27;s head offices are in Bracknell, Berkshire.

As of April 2023, Waitrose &amp; Partners operates 329 shops across Great Britain and the Channel Islands, including 65 &quot;little Waitrose&quot; convenience shops. They also export products to 52 countries and have locations in the Middle East.

Known for its &quot;upmarket&quot; reputation, as described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Waitrose has been positioned as a premium supermarket. However, former managing director Mark Price has noted that its prices are competitive with those of Tesco, a mid-market chain. The company holds a royal warrant to supply groceries, wine, and spirits to King Charles III.

== History ==
Founded in 1904 by Wallace Waite, Arthur Rose and David Taylor, Waitrose &amp; Partners began as a small grocery, Waite, Rose &amp; Taylor, in Acton, West London. In 1908, two years after David Taylor had left the business, the name &quot;Waitrose&quot;, from the remaining founders&#x27; names, was adopted. In 1937, the company, consisting of ten shops and 160 employees, was taken over by the John Lewis Partnership. In 1944, the partnership purchased the South Essex grocery business Schofield and Martin, which had 12 shops in its chain.

In 1955, the chain opened its first Waitrose supermarket in Streatham, London, and continued to expand throughout London and the South East of England during the 1960s. In the 1970s, Waitrose opened branches in Hampshire, Bedfordshire, Essex and Cambridgeshire. On 16 June 2016 the shop&#x27;s most southerly branch opened in Truro, Cornwall.

In the early 21st century, Waitrose continued its expansion, which included purchasing shops from Somerfield, Morrisons and Woolworths.

In 2009 the firm signed a deal with Alliance Boots which allowed Boots to operate branded pharmacies in Waitrose shops and Boots shops to sell Waitrose food products. The partnership between the companies ended in 2012 having been deemed unsuccessful, which led to Boots replacing Waitrose products with items from Irish retailer Musgrave&#x27;s SuperValu chain.

Profitability issues at the end of the decade resulted in John Lewis announcing the closure of five Waitrose shops in 2018 and the sale of a further five Waitrose shops to other retailers in 2019.

==Brand and marketing==
Waitrose sponsored Reading Football Club from 2008 to 2015, and the England cricket team for three years from 2013 to 2016.

In March 2010, Waitrose released a series of adverts, in print, online, and on national television, featuring celebrity chefs Delia Smith and Heston Blumenthal.
===Waitrose Duchy Organic===

In 1983 Waitrose became the first major supermarket chain to sell organic food, and by 2008 it had an 18% share of the organic food market. In September 2009, Duchy Originals, the struggling organic food business started by King Charles III was rescued by Waitrose, which agreed to an exclusive deal to stock the range, and to pay a small fee to his charity. In August 2010, the Duchy range was relaunched with many new lines under the &quot;Duchy Originals from Waitrose&quot; (later &quot;Waitrose Duchy Organic&quot;) brand.

===Product ranges===
* Essential Waitrose: Aware that Waitrose risked being seen as a food retailer for special occasions rather than everyday shopping, the chain launched its value range of products as &quot;essential Waitrose&quot; in March 2009. The marketing used the tagline: &quot;Quality you&#x27;d expect at prices you wouldn&#x27;t&quot;. 1,400 products were branded with this name using simple white-based packaging. Some people poked fun at the range for selling products that are not essential, such as ratatouille Provençal and limoncello desserts. Nevertheless, the range was highly successful. By 2016 it had over 2,000 items and £1.1 billion annual sales, making it one of only five food and drink brands in Britain worth over £1 billion.
* No 1 Waitrose is a range of around 650 premium lines with black packaging.
* Cooks Ingredients are spices, herbs and related products with colourful packaging.
* Heston for Waitrose is a range of prepared foods such as pies and cakes developed by celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal.

===myWaitrose loyalty card===
In late 2011 the supermarket introduced its first loyalty card scheme, &quot;myWaitrose&quot;. It differed from supermarket loyalty schemes like Tesco Clubcard and Nectar, giving cardholders access to exclusive competitions and offers instead of allowing them to collect points.

It later began to give cardholders 10% off selected products, as well as free tea or coffee in store and money off their shopping for purchasing selected newspapers. Former Managing director Mark Price has said that this offer has made Waitrose the second largest provider of coffee in the UK, calling it a &quot;phenomenal&quot; response that showed other schemes offering the different system of loyalty points to be meaningless. He told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;: &quot;Giving free coffee or free newspapers is disruptive to the market, but I think that is what customers want, I don&#x27;t think they want a point. I mean, what is a point? I think it&#x27;s meaningless. It doesn&#x27;t have the richness, it doesn&#x27;t have the affinity you can gauge if you engage with your customers in a different way. It is about what do consumers value today, not what did they value historically. So green shield stamps, or points, were a response to what happened post-war...I just don&#x27;t think that is where the world is now.&quot;

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; also later reported that Waitrose has faced &quot;complaints from disgruntled middle-class shoppers who claim its free coffee offer is attracting the wrong kind of customer&quot;.

===Price matching===
In 2010, Waitrose began a price guarantee, matching prices of 1,000 items with Tesco. In 2012, it extended this campaign to 7,000 items.

===&quot;Waitrose Kitchen&quot; magazine===
In February 2015, &quot;Waitrose Kitchen&quot; magazine included an advertising pamphlet, &quot;Taste of Israel&quot;, submitted by the Israeli government, in which traditional Arabic foods were referred to as Israeli. The advert prompted a social media backlash against Waitrose.

==Corporate practices==

Waitrose and its related brands are owned by the John Lewis Partnership (JLP), which is itself owned by its employees, referred to within the organization as &quot;partners.&quot; Employee shares are held in trust by the Partnership—their shares cannot be sold by the individual partners. The partners&#x27; economic rewards are achieved through the payment of bonuses, based on the JLP&#x27;s annual profits. As such, they receive certain benefits, most notably the Partnership bonus, usually around 10–20% of a Partner&#x27;s yearly salary in a lump sum paid in March (the highest bonus percentage in recent years has been 20%). However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Partnership bonus was suspended in both the 2020 and 2021 financial years, angering many Partners as they felt their hard work was not recognised.

Waitrose donates a portion of its profits to a group of charities on a proportional basis, whilst individual Waitrose branches manage their own charitable donations and local decisions are made on which charities are to be supported. This is a system called &quot;Community Matters&quot;, where customers are invited to choose to whom they want money to be donated.

The supermarket launched the Waitrose Foundation in 2005, providing funds for education, worker facilities, and health services among other things for fruit growers in South Africa. This was expanded to Ghana and Kenya in 2009.

==Shops==
Traditionally, Waitrose branches were largely concentrated in the south-east of England and Greater London; even as recently as 2003, its northernmost English branch was in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire. However, the company&#x27;s expansion northwards and into Scotland since the mid-2000s has changed this significantly: the most northerly Waitrose shop is now located in Stirling, which opened in January 2013. Waitrose opened its 300th shop in Helensburgh on the River Clyde on 23 October 2013.

Waitrose shops vary considerably in size. For example, the smallest branch, little Waitrose at King&#x27;s Cross station, London, occupies only of retail space.

Some Waitrose shops incorporate an in-house restaurant selling hot and cold food sourced in the main from the shop. The myWaitrose card, which customers can obtain online, offers free hot drinks from the store&#x27;s self-service machines with a purchase of goods; this was withdrawn due to the COVID-19 pandemic but as of February 2023 the coffee offer has returned.

Internationally, Waitrose holds a licensing agreement with Spinneys of Dubai, United Arab Emirates, which operate two purpose-built branches, of which the first opened in the Dubai Mall in October 2008. In the United Arab Emirates, it is an official grocery supplier to the royal family, the House of Maktoum. 

===Convenience shops and little Waitrose===
Announcing its foray into the convenience sector in July 2008, Waitrose opened its first convenience shop in Nottingham in December of that year. In September 2009, it was announced that a large scale rollout of the concept was planned, opening up to 300 shops in 5 to 10 years. The new arm will operate in a two-tier environment, with the majority of sites expected to trade from and some trading from a larger floor plate. A trial of a &#x27;little Waitrose&#x27; fascia on smaller floor plate shops may yet lead to brand differentiation of some or all of the convenience estate.

Shell operates a series of Little Waitrose stores at selected petrol stations in the UK.

In August 2024, Waitrose announced plans to open 100 new convenience shops over the next five years.

===Welcome Break===
In May 2009, Waitrose started a franchise deal with the motorway service station operator Welcome Break.

===Closed / sold stores===
Waitrose closed four convenience shops and one supermarket in the UK in 2018. This was followed by the announcement of twelve further store closures in 2019. In September 2020, a further four stores, Caldicot, Ipswich, Shrewsbury and Wolverhampton, were announced as closing, the latter having been sold to Tesco.

==Online presence==
===Ocado===
In April 2000, the online food retailer Ocado was launched, with the Ocado service being only available in certain areas of Britain. John Lewis Partnership came on board as a principal supplier and part owner in October 2000, although the relationship between the two began formally in January 2002. In August 2020, Waitrose announced they would cease operations with Ocado, which ended on 1 September 2020. Ocado partnered with Waitrose&#x27;s rival store Marks &amp; Spencer. Arrangements were amended in 2010 to a ten-year agreement to supply products to Ocado. In February 2011, John Lewis Pension trust divested itself of its Ocado shares.

===Waitrose.com===
Waitrose operates its own delivery service, Waitrose.com (previously WaitroseDeliver), which originally was only available in certain shops, delivering goods ordered through the internet and serviced from the local branch. Not to be confused with Ocado, which is an unrelated business, which formerly had a licence to distribute Waitrose items until 1 September 2020, when Waitrose ended its relationship with Ocado, to instead operate deliveries solely by itself from centralised fulfilment centres. As well as ordinary online groceries shopping, Waitrose.com also hosts the online ordering system for Waitrose&#x27;s special order food and cakes service &quot;Waitrose Entertaining&quot;. Waitrose became the first supermarket to abolish all delivery charges as of May 2009.

In October 2011, Waitrose opened a &quot;Dotcom Fulfilment Centre&quot; in Acton, West London, less than two miles from its original shop. The shop employs over 200 Partners and provides Waitrose internet food deliveries for most of west and central London from a dedicated site. The shop, whilst not open to the public, is laid out in a similar manner to a regular shop and even offers service counter lines, much like a normal Waitrose supermarket.

In March 2020, Waitrose announced that it was to add its Waitrose.com online delivery service to 24 more of its stores across the UK in preparation for its split with Ocado in September 2020.

== Animal welfare ==
Instances of animal abuse and neglect have been documented in the Waitrose supply chain. In 2020, The Independent reported goats were &quot;punched, kicked and painfully slammed onto conveyor belts&quot; at a farm in Yorkshire. Animals were seen being pulled along by their ears, having their tails twisted and being held by their necks.

Undercover footage captured at a slaughterhouse in the Waitrose supply chain showed distressed ducks being roughly put on to shackles before being sent to an electrical bath to be stunned. Live shackling has been condemned by the Farm Animal Welfare Committee.

In 2024, it was reported staff at a slaughterhouse supplying Waitrose repeatedly hit pigs with paddles before they were killed in a carbon dioxide gas chamber. Some animals had visible injuries, lameness, wounds, abnormal growths and other deformities.

==Awards and acclaims==
Waitrose has received a number of awards. Its wines have been given awards by &quot;Decanter&quot; magazine and the International Wine and Spirit Competition. The supermarket chain has also received awards for its retail service, including awards from &quot;Which?&quot; magazine. Compassion in World Farming and the RSPCA have given Waitrose awards for animal welfare.

<text>Sir George Jessel, (13 February 1824 – 21 March 1883) was a British barrister, politician, and judge. He was one of the most influential commercial law and equity judges of his time, and served as the Master of the Rolls. He was the first Jew to be a regular member of the Privy Council and to hold high judicial office.

==Early life and education==
Born in Savile Row, London, Jessel was the son of Zadok Aaron Jessel, a Jewish merchant, and his wife Mary, &quot;née&quot; Harris. He was educated at Mr Neumegen&#x27;s School for Jews at Kew, and being prevented by religious disabilities from proceeding to the University of Oxford or Cambridge, went to University College London, matriculating in 1840. He entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn as a student in 1842, and a year later took his BA at the University of London, becoming MA and gold medallist in mathematics and natural philosophy in 1844. In 1846 he was elected a fellow of University College, London.

He entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1842 as a student and was called to the bar in 1847, taking chambers in Stone Buildings. He read in the chambers of the conveyancer Peter Bellinger Brodie, and was the pupil of Edward John Lloyd and of Barnes Peacock.

==Legal and political career==

Jessel&#x27;s earnings during his first three years at the bar were 52, 346, and 795 guineas, from which it will be seen that his rise to a tolerably large practice was rapid. His work, however, was mainly conveyancing, and for long his income remained almost stationary. By degrees, however, he got more work, and was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1865, becoming a bencher of his Inn in the same year and practising in the Court of Chancery. Jessel entered Parliament as Liberal Party member for Dover in 1868, and although neither his intellect nor his oratory was of a class likely to commend itself to his fellow-members, he attracted William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s attention by two learned speeches on the Bankruptcy Bill which was before the house in 1869, with the result that, in 1871, he was appointed Solicitor General. In 1872, he was knighted.

His business, in addition to that on behalf of the Crown, became very large, and his income for three years before he was raised to the bench amounted to nearly £25,000 per annum.

== Master of the Rolls ==
In 1873, Jessel succeeded Lord Romilly as Master of the Rolls, the Attorney-General (J. D. Coleridge) having refused the office. On accepting from office, he resigned from Parliament, and was sworn of the Privy Council.

From 1873 to 1881, Jessel sat as a judge of first instance in the rolls court, being also a member of the Court of Appeal and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

In November 1874, the first Judicature Act came into effect, and in 1881 the Judicature Act of that year made the Master of the Rolls the ordinary president of the first Court of Appeal, relieving him of his duties as a judge of first instance. In the Court of Appeal Jessel presided almost to the day of his death.

On 22 February 1878, Jessel survived an assassination attempt by Henry John Dodwell, a disturbed clergyman. For some time before 1883 he suffered from diabetes with chronic disorder of the heart and liver, but struggled against it; on 16 March 1883 he sat in court for the last time, and five days later he died, aged 59, at his residence in London, the immediate cause of death being cardiac syncope. The following day, the Court of Appeal adjourned in his honour.

==Legacy==
As a judge of first instance Jessel was a revelation to those accustomed to the proverbial slowness of the chancery courts and of the Master of the Rolls who preceded him. He disposed of the business before him with rapidity combined with correctness of judgment, and he not only had no arrears himself, but was frequently able to help other judges to clear their lists. His knowledge of law and equity was wide and accurate, and his memory for cases and command of the principles laid down in them extraordinary. In the rolls court he never reserved a judgment, not even in the Epping Forest case (&quot;Commissioners of Sewers v Glasse&quot;, L.R. 19 Eq.; &quot;The Times&quot;, 11 November 1874), in which the evidence and arguments lasted twenty-two days (150 witnesses being examined in court, while the documents went back to the days of King John), and in the Court of Appeal he did so only twice, and then in deference to the wishes of his colleagues.

The second of these two occasions was the case of &quot;Robarts v The Corporation of London&quot; (49 &quot;Law Times&quot; 455; &quot;The Times&quot;, 10 March 1883), and those who may read Jessel&#x27;s judgment should remember that, reviewing as it does the law and custom on the subject, and the records of the city with regard to the appointment of a remembrancer from the 16th century, together with the facts of the case before the court, it occupied nearly an hour to deliver, but was nevertheless delivered without notes this, too, on 9 March 1883, when the judge who uttered it was within a fortnight of his death. Never during the 19th century was the business of any court performed so rapidly, punctually, and satisfactorily as it was when Jessel presided.

He was Master of the Rolls at a momentous period of legal history. The Judicature Acts, completing the fusion of law and equity, were passed while he was judge of first instance, and were still new to the courts when he died. His knowledge and power of assimilating knowledge of all subjects, his mastery of every branch of law with which he had to concern himself, as well as of equity, together with his willingness to give effect to the new system, caused it to be said when he died that the success of the Judicature Acts would have been impossible without him.

Jessel sat on the royal commission for the amendment of the Medical Acts, taking an active part in the preparation of its report. He actively interested himself in the management of London University, of which he was a fellow from 1861, and of which he was elected vice-chancellor in 1880. He was one of the commissioners of patents, and trustee of the British Museum. He was also chairman of the committee of judges which drafted the new rules rendered necessary by the Judicature Acts. He was treasurer of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1883, and vice-president of the council of legal education. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society.

Jessel&#x27;s career marks an epoch on the bench, owing to the active part taken by him in rendering the Judicature Acts effective, and also because he was the last judge capable of sitting in the House of Commons, a privilege of which he did not avail himself. He was the first Jew who, as solicitor-general, took a share in the executive government of his country, the first Jew who was sworn a regular member of the privy council, and the first Jew who took a seat on the judicial bench of Great Britain.

==Family==
Jessel married in 1856 Amelia Moses, daughter of Joseph Moses, who survived him together with three daughters and two sons, the elder of whom, Charles, was made a baronet shortly after the death of his distinguished father and in recognition of his services (see Jessel Baronets). Jessel&#x27;s younger son Herbert Jessel was elevated to the peerage as Baron Jessel in 1924.

A great-nephew of Jessel, Richard Frederick Jessel, was a naval hero of the Second World War. Richard&#x27;s son, Toby Jessel, was Conservative MP for Twickenham from 1970 until 1997. Richard&#x27;s daughter, Camilla Jessel, was the second wife of the Polish composer Andrzej Panufnik.

He was the second cousin once removed of the American vaudeville star and comedian George Jessel, who was named after him.

<text>The Type 42 or &quot;Sheffield&quot; class was a class of fourteen guided-missile destroyers that served in the Royal Navy. A further two ships of this class were built for and served with the Argentine Navy.

The first ship of the class was ordered in 1968 and launched in 1971. Two of the class (&quot;Sheffield&quot; and &quot;Coventry&quot;) were lost to enemy action during the Falklands War of 1982. The Royal Navy used this class of destroyer for 38 years between 1975 and 2013.

No ships of this class remain active in the Royal Navy and both have also been retired from the Argentine Navy. The Royal Navy has replaced them with Type 45 destroyers.

==History==

The class was designed in the late 1960s to provide fleet area air defence. In total fourteen vessels were constructed in three batches. In addition to the Royal Navy ships, two more ships were built to the same specifications as the Batch 1 vessels for the Argentine Navy. &quot;Hércules&quot; was built in the UK and &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; in the AFNE Rio Santiago shipyard in Buenos Aires.

 and were lost in the Falklands War to enemy action. This was the first conflict where surface warships of the same design have been on opposite sides since World War II, when four s built for France in 1939 were taken over by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in 1940. The final ship of the class (&quot;Edinburgh&quot;) decommissioned on 6 June 2013. One Argentine Navy ship () remains in service, the other vessel () sank whilst alongside in Puerto Belgrano Naval Base in early 2013.

When the Type 82 air-defence destroyers were cancelled along with the proposed CVA-01 carrier by the Labour Government of 1966, the Type 42 was proposed as a lighter and cheaper design with similar capabilities to the Type 82. The class is fitted with the GWS30 Sea Dart surface-to-air missile first deployed on the sole Type 82 destroyer, . The Type 42s were also given a flight deck and hangar to operate an anti-submarine warfare helicopter, greatly increasing their utility compared to the Type 82, which was fitted with a flight deck but no organic aviation facilities.

The design was budgeted with a ceiling of £19 million per hull but soon ran over budget. The original proposed design (£21 million) was similar to the lengthened &#x27;Batch 3&#x27; Type 42s. To cut costs, the first two batches had 47 feet removed from the bow sections forward of the bridge, and the beam-to-length ratio was proportionally reduced. These early, batch 1 Type 42s performed poorly during the contractor&#x27;s sea trials, particularly in heavy seas, and the hull was examined for other problems. Batch 2 vessels (&quot;Exeter&quot; onwards) embodied better sensor fits and slight layout modifications. The ninth hull, &quot;Manchester&quot;, was lengthened in build, as part of a design review. This proved a better hull form at sea and later hulls were built to this specification. Strengthening girders were later designed into the weather deck structure in the batch 1 and 2 ships, and the batch 3 ships received an external &#x27;strake&#x27; to counter longitudinal cracking.

==Design==
The first batch had the 965 or 966 surveillance radar, which had a &quot;slow data-rate&quot;. The Type 992Q radar used to designate targets for the gun and missiles lacked Moving Target Indiction (MTI). Though &quot;British radar manufacturers [had] offered to retrofit MTI to these radars... nothing was done.&quot; Without MTI, the Type 992Q had difficulty in tracking aircraft when land was behind the aircraft or when there was snow or rain showers. The Type 42 also had &quot;insufficient space for an efficient operations room&quot;.

The Type 42 was also equipped with a 4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun and earlier vessels had six Ships Torpedo Weapon System (STWS) torpedo launchers. Two Phalanx Mk 15 close-in weapon systems (CIWS) were fitted to British Type 42s after the loss of &quot;Sheffield&quot; to an Exocet missile in 1982.

There have been three batches of ships, batch 1 and 2 displacing 4,820 tonnes and batch 3 (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Manchester&quot; class) displacing 5,200 tonnes. The batch 3 ships were heavily upgraded, though the proposed Sea Wolf systems upgrades were never fitted. Because of their more general warfare role, both Argentine ships were fitted with the MM38 Exocet, and not with a CIWS.

The electronics suite included one Type 1022 D band long-range radar with Outfit LFB track extractor or one Type 965P long-range air surveillance radar, one Type 996 E band/F band 3D radar for target indication with Outfit LFA track extractor or type 992Q surface search, two Type 909 I/J-band fire-control radars and an Outfit LFD radar track combiner.

All ships were propelled by Rolls-Royce TM3B Olympus and Rolls-Royce RM1C Tyne marinised gas turbines, arranged in a COGOG (combined gas or gas) arrangement, driving through synchronous self-shifting clutches into a double-reduction, dual tandem, articulated, locked-train gear system and out through two five-bladed controllable pitch propellers. All have four Paxman Ventura 16YJCAZ diesel generators, each generating 1 megawatt of three-phase electric power (440 V 60 Hz).

The first of class, &quot;Sheffield&quot;, was initially fitted with exhaust deflectors on her funnel tops to guide the high-temperature exhaust efflux sidewards and minimise damage to overhead aerials. As this provided a prominent target for then-new infrared homing missiles, only &quot;Sheffield&quot; and both the Argentinian &quot;Hércules&quot; and &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; had these. All subsequent engine uptakes were fitted with &#x27;cheese graters&#x27; that mixed machinery space vent air with the engine exhaust to reduce infrared signatures.

==Availability and use of the Type 42==

This class was originally conceived to be a stopper for long-range strategic bombers from the former Soviet Long Range Aviation/A-VMF and as area defence for carrier battle groups. Seven of the class took part in the Falklands War (Operation Corporate) and the immediate aftermath. The Type 42 provided a capable long-range defence against Argentine air force assets, scoring three confirmed kills. However, &quot;Sheffield&quot; was hit and disabled by a long-range first-generation air-to-surface missile (Exocet) and sank six days later, &quot;Coventry&quot; was sunk by conventional iron bombs, and &quot;Glasgow&quot; was disabled by a single bomb that passed straight through her aft engine room without exploding; an extensive rethink was conducted and future iterations were adopted. Later uses included The Gulf War, when &quot;Gloucester&quot; shot down a land-based surface-to-surface missile. Type 42s were called upon to carry out fleet contingency ship duties such as West Indies counter drugs operations and Falkland Islands patrol, NATO Mediterranean and Atlantic task group operations, and Persian Gulf patrols. The deployment of Type 23s in lieu of Type 42s to high-intensity mission areas became more prevalent as serviceability and reliability issues dogged Type 42s availability, as did obsolescence of their combat and machinery system equipment.

==Construction programme==

In May 1982, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Jerry Wiggin) stated that the current replacement cost of a Type 42 destroyer of the &quot;Sheffield&quot; class was &quot;about £120 million.&quot; In July 1984, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (John Lee) stated: &quot;the average cost of the three Type 42 destroyers currently under construction is £117 million at 1983–84 price levels.&quot;

==Running costs==

===Not including major refits and upgrades===
===Including refits and upgrades===
In May 2000, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (John Spellar) stated: &quot;The running costs of each of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 42 destroyers for each of the past five years are contained in the following table. This includes repair and maintenance, manpower, fuel, and other costs such as port and harbour dues. Year-on-year variations are largely attributable to refit periods.&quot;

==Availability==
In February 1998, the Minister of State for Defence, Dr Reid said: &quot;Type 42 destroyers achieved approximately 84 to 86 per cent average availability for operational service in each of the last five years. This discounts time spent in planned maintenance.&quot;

==Fate of ships==


The surviving Argentine Type 42, &quot;Hércules&quot;, was based at Puerto Belgrano Naval Base, Argentina, and converted into an amphibious command ship through the addition of a new aft superstructure and hangar. She was originally fitted with four single Exocet missile launchers, two on either side of the funnel facing forward but these were removed during refit. As of 2020, &quot;Hércules&quot; was reported to be non-operational. The other Argentine vessel, &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;, capsized and sank alongside her berth at Puerto Belgrano on 22 January 2013, reportedly as a result of poor maintenance and negligence leading to a burst seawater main and catastrophic flooding. She was formally taken out of service in 2024.

Prior to her demise, &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; was extensively cannibalised for spare parts for her more active sister ship. In December 2015, she was refloated and placed in drydock to evaluate the cost of restoration as a museum ship. Finally, due to the very high cost required, it was decided to scrap her in 2016.

==Replacement==

The UK ships are all now decommissioned. By 2007 none of the batch 1 vessels remained in commission. Initially, the UK sought to procure replacements first in collaboration with seven other NATO nations under the NFR-90 project and then with France and Italy through the Horizon CNGF programme. However, both these collaborative ventures failed and the UK decided to go it alone with a national project.

The UK Type 42s are succeeded by six Type 45 destroyers. , , , , and are all in commission. The Type 42 class suffered from cramped accommodation, a problem for crew safety and comfort, and also when finding space for upgrades. The Type 45s are considerably larger, displacing 7,500 tonnes, compared to the Type 42 displacement of 3,600 tonnes.

<doc id="386100" wikidata="Q900183" url="?curid=386100" title="Microscope slide">
<text>A microscope slide is a thin flat piece of glass, typically 75 by 26 mm (3 by 1 inches) and about 1 mm thick, used to hold objects for examination under a microscope. Typically the object is mounted (secured) on the slide, and then both are inserted together in the microscope for viewing. This arrangement allows several slide-mounted objects to be quickly inserted and removed from the microscope, labeled, transported, and stored in appropriate slide cases or folders etc.

Microscope slides are often used together with a cover slip or cover glass, a smaller and thinner sheet of glass that is placed over the specimen. Slides are held in place on the microscope&#x27;s stage by slide clips, slide clamps or a cross-table which is used to achieve precise, remote movement of the slide upon the microscope&#x27;s stage (such as in an automated/computer operated system, or where touching the slide with fingers is inappropriate either due to the risk of contamination or lack of precision).

==History==

The origin of the concept was pieces of ivory or bone, containing specimens held between disks of transparent mica, that would &quot;slide&quot; into the gap between the stage and the objective. These &quot;sliders&quot; were popular in Victorian-era England until the Royal Microscopical Society introduced the standardized glass microscope slide.

==Dimensions and types==

A standard microscope slide measures about 75 mm by 25 mm (3″ by 1″) and is about 1 mm thick. A range of other sizes are available for various special purposes, such as 75 x 50 mm for geological use, 46 x 27 mm for petrographic studies, and 48 x 28 mm for thin sections. Slides are usually made of common glass and their edges are often finely ground or polished.

Microscope slides are usually made of optical quality glass, such as soda lime glass or borosilicate glass, but specialty plastics are also used. Fused quartz slides are often used when ultraviolet transparency is important, e.g. in fluorescence microscopy.

While plain slides are the most common, there are several specialized types. A concavity slide or cavity slide has one or more shallow depressions (&quot;wells&quot;), designed to hold slightly thicker objects, and certain samples such as liquids and tissue cultures. Slides may have rounded corners for increased safety or robustness, or a cut-off corner for use with a slide clamp or cross-table, where the slide is secured by a spring-loaded curved arm contacting one corner, forcing the opposing corner of the slide against a right angled arm which does not move. If this system were used with a slide which did not incorporate these cut-off corners, the corners would chip and the slide could shatter.

A graticule slide is marked with a of lines (for example, a 1 mm grid) that allows the size of objects seen under magnification to be easily estimated and provides reference areas for counting minute objects. Sometimes one square of the grid will itself be subdivided into a finer grid. Slides for specialized applications, such as hemocytometers for cell counting, may have various reservoirs, channels and barriers etched or ground on their upper surface. Various permanent markings or masks may be printed, sand-blasted, or deposited on the surface by the manufacturer, usually with inert materials such as PTFE.

Some slides have a frosted or enamel-coated area at one end, for labeling with a pencil or pen. Slides may have special coatings applied by the manufacturer, e.g. for chemical inertness or enhanced cell adhesion. The coating may have a permanent electric charge to hold thin or powdery samples. Common coatings include poly-L-lysine, silanes, epoxy resins, or even gold.

==Mounting==

The mounting of specimens on microscope slides is often critical for successful viewing. The problem has been given much attention in the last two centuries and is a well-developed area with many specialized and sometimes quite sophisticated techniques. Specimens are often held into place using the smaller glass cover slips.

The main function of the cover slip is to keep solid specimens pressed flat, and liquid samples shaped into a flat layer of even thickness. This is necessary because high-resolution microscopes have a very narrow region within which they focus.

The cover glass often has several other functions. It holds the specimen in place (either by the weight of the cover slip or, in the case of a wet mount, by surface tension) and protects the specimen from dust and accidental contact. It protects the microscope&#x27;s objective lens from contacting the specimen and vice versa; in oil immersion microscopy or water immersion microscopy the cover slip prevents contact between the immersion liquid and the specimen. The cover slip can be glued to the slide so as to seal off the specimen, retarding dehydration and oxidation of the specimen and also preventing contamination. A number of sealants are in use, including commercial sealants, laboratory preparations, or even regular clear nail polish, depending on the sample. A solvent-free sealant that can be used for live cell samples is &quot;valap&quot;, a mixture of vaseline, lanolin and paraffin in equal parts.
Microbial and cell cultures can be grown directly on the cover slip before it is placed on the slide, and specimens may be permanently mounted on the slip instead of on the slide.

Cover slips are available in a range of sizes and thicknesses. Using the wrong thickness can result in spherical aberration and a reduction in resolution and image intensity. Specialty objectives may be used to image specimens without coverslips, or may have correction collars that permit a user to accommodate for alternative coverslip thickness.

===Dry mount===
In a dry mount, the simplest kind of mounting, the object is merely placed on the slide. A cover slip may be placed on top to protect the specimen and the microscope&#x27;s objective and to keep the specimen still and pressed flat. This mounting can be successfully used for viewing specimens like pollen, feathers, hairs, etc. It is also used to examine particles caught in transparent membrane filters (e.g., in analysis of airborne dust).

===Wet mount or temporary mount===
In a wet mount, the specimen is placed in a drop of iodine or other liquid held between the slide and the cover slip by surface tension. This method is commonly used, for example, to view microscopic organisms that grow in pond water or other liquid media, especially lakes.

===Prepared mount or permanent mount===
For pathological and biological research, the specimen usually undergoes a complex histological preparation that involves fixing it to prevent decay, removing any water contained in it, replacing the water with paraffin, cutting it into very thin sections using a microtome, placing the sections on a microscope slide, staining the tissue using various stains to reveal specific tissue components, clearing the tissue to render it transparent and covering it with a coverslip and mounting medium.

===Strewn mount===
Strewn mounting describes the production of palynological microscope slides by suspending a concentrated sample in distilled water, placing the samples on a slide, and allowing the water to evaporate.

===Mounting media===
The mounting medium is the solution in which the specimen is embedded, generally under a cover glass. Simple liquids like water or glycerol can be considered mounting media, though the term generally refers to compounds that harden into a permanent mount. Popular mounting media include &quot;Permount&quot;, and Hoyer&#x27;s mounting medium and an alternative &quot;glycerine jelly&quot; Properties of a good mounting medium include having a refractive index close to that of glass (1.518), non-reactivity with the specimen, stability over time without crystallizing, darkening, or changing refractive index, solubility in the medium the specimen was prepared in (either aqueous or non-polar, such as xylene or toluene), and not causing the specimen stain to fade or leach.

====Examples of mounting media====

=====Aqueous=====
Popularly used in immunofluorescent cytochemistry where the fluorescence cannot be archived. The temporary storage must be done in a dark moist chamber. Common examples are:
#Glycerol-PBS (9:1) with antiquench, e.g. any of the following
##p-phenylenediamine
##propyl gallate
##1,4-Diazabicyclo (2,2,2)-octane (DABCO) (very popular)
##Ascorbic acid
##Mowiol or Gelvatol
#Gelatin
#Mount
#Vectashield
#Prolong Gold
#CyGEL / CyGEL Sustain (to immobilize living, unfixed cells and organisms)

=====Non-aqueous=====

Used when a permanent mount is required
# Permount (toluene and a polymer of a-pinene, b-pinene, dipentene, b-phellandrene)
# Canada balsam
# DPX (&quot;D&quot;istrene 80 – a commercial polystyrene, a &quot;p&quot;lasticizer e.g. dibutyl phthalate and xylene)
# DPX new (with xylene but free of carcinogenic dibutyl phthalate)
# Entellan (with toluene)
# Entellan new
# Hempstead Halide Hoyer&#x27;s Medium (a proprietary formulation of the traditional Hoyer&#x27;s medium containing 60% Chloral, but free of known carcinogens)
# Neo-Mount (compatible with aliphatic neo-clear but not compatible with aromatic solvents like xylene)

==Contrasting with other types/meanings of &quot;mounting&quot;==
In contrast to mounting necessary for glass coverslips, somewhat similar mounting can be done for bulkier specimen preservation in glass containers in museums. However an entirely different type of mounting is done for sample preparation, which can be for biological or nonbiological materials and is further subdivided into &quot;hot&quot;(compressive) and &quot;cold&quot; (castable) type mounting processes. Though named &quot;mounting&quot;, it is more akin to embedding in histology and should not be confused with the mounting described above. The term mounting in other fields has numerous other meanings.
