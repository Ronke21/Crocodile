<text>The half dollar, sometimes referred to as the half for short or 50-cent piece, is a United States coin worth 50 cents, or one half of a dollar. In both size and weight, it is the largest circulating coin currently minted in the United States, being in diameter and in thickness, and is twice the weight of the quarter. The coin&#x27;s design has undergone a number of changes throughout its history. Since 1964, the half dollar depicts the profile of President John F. Kennedy on the obverse and the seal of the president of the United States on the reverse.

Although seldom used today, half-dollar coins were once common in circulation and saw regular use alongside other denominations of US coinage, but have become uncommon in general circulation for several reasons. Half-dollars were produced in fairly large quantities until the year 2002, when the U.S. Mint reduced production of the coin and ceased minting them for regular circulation. As a result of its decreasing usage, many pre-2002 half dollars remain in Federal Reserve vaults, prompting the change in production. Presently, collector half dollars can be ordered directly from the U.S. Mint, and circulated half dollars minted from 1971-2001 are generally available at most American banks and credit unions. Beginning in 2021, half dollars were again produced for general circulation.

==Circulation==
Half-dollar coins saw heavy circulation until the mid 1960s. For many years, they were (and in many areas still are) commonly used by gamblers at casinos and other venues with slot machines. Rolls of half dollars may still be kept on hand in cardrooms for games requiring 50-cent antes or bring-in bets, for dealers to pay winning naturals in blackjack, or where the house collects a rake in increments. Additionally, some concession vendors at sporting events distribute half-dollar coins as change for convenience.

By the early 1960s, the rising price of silver neared the point where the bullion value of U.S. silver coins would exceed face value. In 1965, the U.S. introduced layered-composition coins made of a pure copper core sandwiched between two cupronickel outer faces. The silver content of dimes and quarters was eliminated, but the Kennedy half-dollar, introduced in 1964, contained silver (reduced from 90% in 1964 to 40% from 1965 to 1970). Even with its reduced silver content, the half dollar attracted widespread interest from speculators and coin collectors, which led to extensive hoarding of half dollars dated 1970 and earlier. In 1971, the composition of the half was changed to match that of the clad dimes and quarters, and with an increase in production, the coin saw a moderate increase in usage; however, by this time many businesses and the public had begun to lose interest in the half dollar and gradually, its usage began to wane. By the end of the 1970s, the half dollar had become uncommon in circulation. Merchants stopped ordering half dollars from their banks, and many banks stopped ordering half dollars from the Federal Reserve, and the U.S. mints sharply reduced production of the coins.

From 2001-2020, half dollars were minted only for collectors, due to large Federal Reserve and government inventories of pre-2001 coins; this was primarily due to a lack of demand and large quantity returns of halves from casinos that switched to using &quot;coin-less&quot; slot machines. Eventually, the reserve supply of halves began to run low and in 2021, the mint resumed production of half dollars for general circulation. 
Modern-date half dollars can be purchased in proof sets, mint sets, rolls, and bags from the U.S. Mint, and existing inventory circulation pieces can be obtained or ordered through most U.S. banks and credit unions. All collector issues since 2001 have had much lower mintages than in previous years. Although intended only for collectors, 2001-2020 half dollars can often be found in circulation.

==Aspects of early history==
On December 1, 1794, the first half dollars, approximately 5,300 pieces, were delivered. Another 18,000 were produced in January 1795 using dies of 1794, to save the expense of making new ones. Another 30,000 pieces were struck by the end of 1801. The coin had the Heraldic Eagle, based on the Great Seal of the United States on the reverse. 150,000 were minted in 1804 but struck with dies from 1803, so no 1804 specimens exist, though there were some pieces dated 1805 that carried a &quot;5 over 4&quot; overdate.

In 1838, half-dollar dies were produced in the Philadelphia Mint for the newly established New Orleans Mint, and ten test samples of the 1838 half dollars were made at the main Philadelphia mint. These samples were put into the mint safe along with other rarities like the 1804 silver dollar. The dies were then shipped to New Orleans for the regular production of 1838 half dollars. However, New Orleans production of the half dollars was delayed due to the priority of producing half dimes and dimes. The large press for half-dollar production was not used in New Orleans until January 1839 to produce 1838 half dollars, but the reverse die could not be properly secured, and only ten samples were produced before the dies failed. Rufus Tyler, chief coiner of the New Orleans mint, wrote to Mint Director Patterson of the problem on February 25, 1839. The Orleans mint samples all had a double stamped reverse as a result of this production problem and they also showed dramatic signs of die rust, neither of which are present on the Philadelphia produced test samples. While eight Philadelphia minted samples survive to this day, there is only one known New Orleans minted specimen with the tell-tale double stamped reverse and die rust. This is the famous coin that Rufus Tyler presented to Alexander Dallas Bache (great grandson of Benjamin Franklin) in the summer of 1839 and was later purchased in June 1894 by A. G. Heaton, the father of mint mark coin collecting. The 1838 Philadelphia-produced half dollars are extremely rare, with two separate specimens having sold for $632,500 in Heritage auctions in 2005 and 2008 respectively. The sole surviving Orleans minted 1838 is one of the rarest of all American coins. In 1840, this mint produced nearly 180,000 half dollars.

In 1861, the New Orleans mint produced coins for three different governments. A total of 330,000 were struck under the United States government, 1,240,000 for the State of Louisiana after it seceded from the Union, and 962,633 after it joined the Confederacy. Since the same die was used for all strikings, the output looks identical. However the Confederate States of America actually minted four half dollars with a CSA (rather than USA) reverse and the obverse die they used had a small die crack. Thus &quot;regular&quot; 1861 half dollars with this crack probably were used by the Confederates for some of the mass striking.

There are two varieties of Kennedy half dollars in the proof set issues of 1964. Initially, the die was used with accented hair, showing deeper lines than the president&#x27;s widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, preferred. New dies were prepared to smooth out some of the details. It is estimated that about 1 to 3% (40,000 to 100,000) of the proof halves are of the earlier type, making them somewhat more expensive for collectors.

<doc id="374704" wikidata="Q313440" url="?curid=374704" title="Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina">
<text>The Stabilisation Force (SFOR) was a NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina after the Bosnian War. Although SFOR was led by NATO, several non-NATO countries contributed troops. It was replaced by EUFOR Althea in December 2004.

==Mission==
The stated mission of SFOR was to &quot;deter hostilities and stabilise the peace, contribute to a secure environment by providing a continued military presence in the Area Of Responsibility (AOR), target and co-ordinate SFOR support to key areas including primary civil implementation organisations, and progress towards a lasting consolidation of peace, without further need for NATO-led forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina&quot;.

==Structure and history==
SFOR was established in Security Council Resolution 1088 on 12 December 1996. It succeeded the much larger Implementation Force IFOR which was deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina on 20 December 1995 with a one-year mandate. The commanders of the SFOR, who each served one-year terms, were General William W. Crouch, General Eric Shinseki, General Montgomery Meigs, Lt. General Ronald Adams, Lt. General Michael Dodson, Lt. General John B. Sylvester, Lt. General William E. Ward, Major General Virgil Packett and Brigadier General Steven P. Schook.

SFOR operated in support of NATO Operation Joint Guard and Operation Joint Forge.

Troop levels were reduced to approximately 12,000 by the close of 2002, and to approximately 7,000 by the close of 2004. During NATO&#x27;s 2004 Istanbul Summit the end of the SFOR mission was announced.

It was replaced by the European Union&#x27;s EUFOR Althea, on 2 December 2004 at NATO HQ, Camp Butmir, Sarajevo, B-H. Operation Joint Forge was succeeded by the EU&#x27;s Operation Althea.

SFOR was divided into three zones of operation: 
*Mostar MND(S) – Italian, French, German, Spanish
*Banja Luka MND(W) – American, British, Canadian, Czech, Dutch. The British code name for their activities in IFOR was Operation Resolute and SFOR was Operation Lodestar (to June 1998) and Operation Palatine (from June 1998). The Canadian mission was named Operation Palladium (1996 to 2004).
*Tuzla MND(N) – American, Turkish, Polish, Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Finnish.

(Some units had troops stationed outside the assigned zone)

The three AOs were known collectively as Multi-National Divisions until the end of 2002 where they were reduced in scope to Multi-National Brigades.

SFOR operated under peace enforcement, not peacekeeping, rules of engagement. For example, it was cleared, in 1997, to neutralise Serb radio-television facilities. During its mandate, SFOR arrested 29 individuals who were charged with war crimes. Those arrested were transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Netherlands. 
U.S. service members serving in SFOR were awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the NATO Medal.

SFOR operated as part of Operation Joint Guard and Operation Joint Forge. As time progressed, the numbers of troops allotted to SFOR declined. On 2 December 2004, SFOR disbanded and its functions were assumed by military units from the European Union organized as European Union Forces (EUFOR).

===Air operations===
Several sequential air operations supported the stabilization efforts.

<doc id="374705" wikidata="Q272239" url="?curid=374705" title="Twisted Sister">
<text>Twisted Sister was an American heavy metal band formed in 1972 in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, and later based on Long Island, New York. Their best-known songs include &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot;, both of which were associated with music videos noted for their sense of slapstick humor. Besides their music, the band is equally remembered for their hairstyles and wearing of female clothing and make-up, leading to a categorization as &quot;glam metal&quot;; lead vocalist Dee Snider rejects the label as inappropriate. 

Twisted Sister evolved from a band named Silver Star, and experienced several membership changes before settling on the classic lineup of Jay Jay French (guitars), Eddie &quot;Fingers&quot; Ojeda (guitars), Dee Snider (lead vocals), Mark &quot;The Animal&quot; Mendoza (bass), and A. J. Pero (drums) in 1982. It was this lineup which recorded the band&#x27;s first four albums. Twisted Sister&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Under the Blade&quot; (1982) and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1983), were critically well-received and earned the band underground popularity. The band achieved mainstream success with their third album, &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; (1984), and its single &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot;, which was their only Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Their next two albums, &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; (1985) and &quot;Love Is for Suckers&quot; (1987), did not match the success of &quot;Stay Hungry&quot;, and Twisted Sister disbanded in 1988.

In the late 1990s, the band briefly reunited before more-permanently reforming in 2003. They released two more albums, &quot;Still Hungry&quot; (2004), a re-recording of their third album, and a Christmas album, &quot;A Twisted Christmas&quot; (2006). Following Pero&#x27;s death in 2015, the band embarked on a farewell tour and subsequently separated again after completing the tour in 2016.

Twisted Sister was ranked at No. 73 on VH1&#x27;s list of &quot;100 greatest artists of hard rock&quot;.

==History==
===Early days (1972–1976)===
In late December 1972, Manhattan resident John Segall (who later renamed himself &quot;Jay Jay French&quot;) auditioned for, and was asked to join, the &quot;glitter band&quot; Silver Star from Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey. Silver Star was formed by drummer Mel Anderson (&quot;Mel Star&quot;) as the &quot;New Jersey version of the New York Dolls&quot;, consisting of Billy Diamond (lead guitar), Wayne Brown (lead vocals and guitar), Tony Bunn (bass) and Steve Guarino (keyboards). Michael O&#x27;Neill took over the lead vocals from Brown, who had left; Segall hated the name &quot;Silver Star&quot;, and pushed to have it changed. O&#x27;Neill came up with the name &quot;Twisted Sister&quot; at a rehearsal on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1973. Along with the name change came stylistic changes that eventually spurred several members to leave the band, amicably, including Bunn and Guarino; Diamond, Star, Segall (now &quot;Johnny Heartbreaker&quot;, soon to change his name permanently to &quot;Jay Jay French&quot;), and new bass player Kenneth Harrison Neill made-up the next lineup of Twisted Sister.

The band found work immediately, and started playing six nights a week. They secured a residency at the Mad Hatter in East Quogue, New York, for the summer of 1973 and played 78 shows there, and another 27 shows elsewhere, for a total of 105 shows from Memorial Day to Labor Day. By December 1974, Jay Jay had already played nearly 600 nights and about 3,000 performances, as the band played five 40-minute shows per night (each with costume changes) some ending as late as 8 AM, the following morning. At this point, the band broke-up and a second iteration brought in a new lead singer (Rick Prince) and guitar player (Keith Angel). After Prince failed to show for a rehearsal in early 1975, Jay Jay took over the lead vocals and management duties. The band split up after Labor Day weekend 1975. In October 1975, the fourth version of the band started to play the club circuit. Jay Jay hired a former high school friend named Eddie Ojeda, who joined as co-lead singer and second guitarist, and got drummer Kevin John Grace after reading an ad that Kevin had put in the Village Voice. Bassist Neill remained and completed the lineup. The band followed a more glam rock direction, influenced by David Bowie, Slade, Mott the Hoople, the Rolling Stones, and the New York Dolls. They played at local clubs, but floundered in relative obscurity.

===Club days (1976–1982)===
In February 1976, at the suggestion of the band&#x27;s agent, Kevin Brenner, Jay Jay was told that the band could only go so far without being able to play Led Zeppelin cover songs and urged Jay Jay to hire Danny Snider (Dee Snider), who had been in the bands Peacock and Heathen. Danny changed his name to Dee at Jay Jay&#x27;s suggestion and thus began line up number six of Twisted Sister. This version lasted just six weeks, with drummer Grace departing. The group took a heavier musical direction in April 1976 with the addition of new drummer Tony Petri, who was heavily influenced by Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Slade, and Alice Cooper. In 1978 Neill became a born-again Christian after a stint in rehab for alcoholism; his parish, however, objected to his participation in the band, which they deemed to be Satanic. After his departure, the band recruited Dictators bassist Mark Mendoza to replace him.

The band moved in a more heavy metal direction in 1978, when the group began to record its demos. Two of their demos found their way to compilation albums by New York classic rock radio station WBAB, and were later re-recorded for the band&#x27;s first two albums.

Having audience participation in the &quot;Sweet Jane Gong Show&quot; and the &quot;Death to Disco&quot; stage routines became legendary. The band broke attendance records at large halls in the Tri-State Area and its growing fan base began to take the name &quot;S.M.F.F.O.T.S.&quot;, for Sick Motherfucking Friends Of Twisted Sister, later shortened to &quot;S.M.F.&quot; for &quot;Sick Mother Fuckers&quot;. NME reported that Twisted Sister had sold out the 3,000 capacity New York Palladium for a March 16 show without a recording contract or radio airplay. Fan hysteria and the seemingly &quot;lost art of entertainment&quot; soon became the hallmark of a TS show. After selling out the Palladium, the group began aggressively pursuing a recording contract, with an aim to get out of the club circuit before its impending collapse due to the upcoming change of the drinking age from 18 to 21.

The band went through three more line up changes between 1979 and 1982. Drummer Joey Brighton replaced Tony Petri, former Dictators drummer Richie Teeter replaced Brighton and, finally, on April 1, 1982, AJ Pero replaced Teeter. Future Shark Island and The Scream drummer Walt Woodward III was also in the band for three days in 1982.

The band started its own T-shirt company and record label. The group released two singles that eventually made it over to the UK and caught the attention of Martin Hooker, the president of indie label Secret Records, a small British label that was mainly a punk outlet. Jay Jay remained as manager through 1981 at which time he hired Mark Puma, a local promoter, to manage the band. This lineup (Dee Snider, Jay Jay French, Eddie Ojeda, Mark Mendoza and A.J. Pero) is considered the &quot;official Twisted Sister line up&quot; because this version is responsible for almost all the studio albums, singles, videos and DVDs. On the suggestion of two reporters from &quot;Sounds&quot; and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazines, Twisted Sister left New York to find a label in the UK. There, in April 1982, they were finally signed by Secret Records. The band also took $22,000 to the UK to appear on the show &quot;The Tube&quot;.

===First two albums (1982–1984)===
In July 1982, the group released its first EP, &quot;Ruff Cutts&quot;, on the Secret Records label, still featuring Tony Petri on the drums. This was followed shortly by the group&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Under the Blade&quot;, produced by Pete Way of UFO. Despite rather low production quality, the album was an underground hit in the UK, providing the band with sufficient name recognition to open for such metal acts as Motörhead. The album had an overall raw metal sound and included &quot;Tear It Loose&quot;, a very fast speed-metal song featuring a guitar solo by &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke of Motörhead. Another single, the future hit &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot;, was planned for release, but Secret Records went out of business before Snider was able to complete the lyrics.

After that appearance on the music TV program &quot;The Tube&quot;, Atlantic Records approached the band and signed them. Atlantic was one of the labels that had turned Twisted Sister down in the &quot;Club Days&quot; period. The band&#x27;s first LP under Atlantic, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, produced by Stuart Epps, was released in 1983 and included the UK No. 18 hit &quot;I Am (I&#x27;m Me)&quot;. From a production standpoint, the album sounded better than its predecessor, and it was every bit as heavy. Upon the success of the album the company decided to promote the band more heavily. A music video was made for the title track of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll&quot;, which was to become the first of a series of comedic videos that popularized the band.

===Mainstream popularity (1984–1985)===
International fame came for Twisted Sister when the band&#x27;s third LP, &quot;Stay Hungry&quot;, hit the stores on May 10, 1984. During the successful tour, a young Metallica supported the band. &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; sold more than two million copies by the summer of 1985, and went on to sell more than three million in subsequent years. It remains the band&#x27;s biggest success.

Videos of hit singles &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; (No. 21 hit in the United States) and &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot; (No. 68 in the United States) ran almost constantly on MTV. The acclaimed surreal comedy film &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; took this further with the band having an appearance making a fictional video for &quot;Burn In Hell&quot; on the Warner Bros. backlot only to be interrupted by Pee-wee Herman passing through. Despite being comedic in nature, the videos featured violence against parents and teachers, which placed the band under heavy criticism by conservative organizations. The group was singled out by the PMRC in 1985. Their songs &quot;Under the Blade&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; were specifically mentioned in the associated Senate hearings. Snider, along with John Denver and Frank Zappa, testified before a Senate committee during these hearings on September 19, 1985.

===Decline and fall (1985–1989)===
On November 9, 1985, the band released its fourth studio album, &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, produced by Dieter Dierks. It was not nearly as successful as its predecessor, although it did earn the band a gold certification for sales of 500,000 copies. Some speculate that the failure was partly due to MTV choosing not to air the video for &quot;Be Chrool to Your Scuel&quot; on the grounds that it was graphically offensive. The song featured such guests as Alice Cooper (who also stars in the video), Brian Setzer, Clarence Clemons and Billy Joel. The tour supporting the album was a near fiasco, with low attendance and many cancelled dates. Not even Atlantic&#x27;s re-release of a remixed &quot;Under the Blade&quot; helped the band recover its popularity. &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; was one of the first CDs to go out of print.

After the tour, Pero left to rejoin Cities. He was replaced by ex-Good Rats drummer Joey &quot;Seven&quot; Franco. The nickname &quot;Seven&quot; comes from his being the band&#x27;s seventh drummer.

In 1986, Snider embarked on a solo project, reportedly approaching future Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers, but this did not work out. Janick recalls it as follows: &quot;He rang me up and we talked but I remember saying, &#x27;There is no way in this world that I am putting on make up or anything like that, I&#x27;m just not into that shit.&#x27; But we had a chat and he seemed like a nice enough guy. But I never heard back from him.&quot;

Snider then recorded an album with Franco programming the drum machine and featuring several session musicians such as Reb Beach on guitar and Kip Winger (just before they formed Winger) and Steve Whiteman of Kix. Atlantic Records refused to release it unless it was labeled as a Twisted Sister album. So, on August 13, 1987 &quot;Love Is for Suckers&quot; made its debut. Although the band had not played in the recording sessions, it was mentioned on the album cover as if the group had, and the band did play some of the songs in subsequent shows. Beau Hill&#x27;s production gave the album a very polished pop metal sound. The band&#x27;s members had also removed the makeup that they had been wearing since their early days. The music video for the lead single &quot;Hot Love&quot;, featuring the band members without their makeup, had moderate success on MTV. Commercially though, the album was a complete failure and many of the band&#x27;s metal fans were disappointed with the pop sound.

On October 12, 1987, almost two months after the release of &quot;Love Is for Suckers&quot;, Snider left the band, the record label cancelled its contract, and Twisted Sister disbanded. The public announcement of the band&#x27;s demise came in January 1988.

===Separation period (1989–1997)===
After the band&#x27;s break-up, former members were involved in different projects:
* Snider formed Desperado, Widowmaker, and SMFs. Joey Franco also played drums in Widowmaker. Snider also wrote and starred in the movie &quot;Strangeland&quot;. 
* Ojeda went on to join Scarerow and then formed Prisoners of War. He also worked as a session guitarist and guitar instructor.
* French stopped performing except for some guest appearances. He formed French Management and produced the alternative metal band Sevendust&#x27;s first self-titled album.
* Mendoza briefly joined Blackfoot. Then he worked as a producer and manager. He also occasionally pursued solo projects.
* Pero was involved in several projects and subsequently toured with Snider&#x27;s SMFs. Pero for a time during this period also worked in a now defunct (as of January 2017) Staten Island, NY audio shop called Clone Audio.
* Franco worked as a session drummer and played with Snider&#x27;s Widowmaker.

In 1992, Atlantic Records, released a &quot;best of&quot; album &quot;Big Hits and Nasty Cuts&quot; that also featured some live performances from the &quot;Under The Blade&quot; period. This album was compiled by French. A live album from the &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; era named &quot;Live At Hammersmith&quot; was released in 1994 by CMC International.

===Reunions and reissues (1998–2014)===

In 1998, the band recorded a song for the soundtrack of Snider&#x27;s movie &quot;Strangeland&quot;.

In 1999, Spitfire Records re-issued the group&#x27;s back catalog, supplemented with previously unreleased tracks. This was followed by &quot;Club Daze Volume 1: The Studio Sessions&quot;, an album containing demo recordings from the pre-&quot;Under the Blade&quot; era, which has three songs that were written by French, this was the first time someone other than Snider was writing songs and &quot;Club Daze Volume 2: Live In The Bars&quot;, a live counterpart.

In 2001, Koch Records released a tribute album under the name &quot;Twisted Forever: A Tribute To The Legendary Twisted Sister&quot;. The album featured a wide range of artists and bands who had been influenced by Twisted Sister, including Lit, Motörhead, Chuck D, Anthrax, Overkill, Cradle of Filth, Joan Jett, Sebastian Bach, and HammerFall. Oddly for a tribute album, Twisted Sister was also present with a cover of AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Sin City&quot;.

In November 2001, the reunited Twisted Sister joined fellow New York metal artists Anthrax, Overkill, Sebastian Bach, and Ace Frehley to headline a benefit concert for NYPD and FDNY Widows and Orphans Fund in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. &quot;New York Steel&quot; raised over $100,000 for the charity, and the reaction to the first Twisted Sister set in 14 years was overwhelming. The demand for more live dates was immediate and the band took the first steps toward returning to the concert stage.

In 2002, a remastered &quot;best of&quot; compilation named &quot;Essentials&quot; was released. Fans generally consider this to be a better compilation than the one previously issued by Atlantic.

2002 also saw the featuring of &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot; as one of the gameplay radio songs on the videogame &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;. The song features in the playlist of the fictional radio station &quot;V Rock&quot;.

In 2003, Snider and Franco collaborated on a Halloween-themed project called Van Helsing&#x27;s Curse. The project&#x27;s first album, &quot;Oculus Infernum&quot;, was released by Koch Records and featured a blend of heavy metal and orchestral elements in the style of Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

Twisted Sister, this time including Mark Mendoza, reunited again for the Sweden Rock Festival in June 2003. The band also appeared in August of that same year at the Wacken Open Air festival. Footage from that show was filmed for a DVD release, which featured former Violent Apathy and Spite member, Tom Fuller.

In March 2004, the band entered the studio to completely re-record the group&#x27;s &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; album for Demolition Records. The band members reported that they were not happy with the original album&#x27;s production, so this time they produced it themselves. The re-recording was released under the name &quot;Still Hungry&quot; and contained seven bonus tracks.

In July 2005, the group played a free concert in Edmonton for the Klondike Days festival. In late 2005, Snider appeared on &quot;Numbers from the Beast: An All-Star Tribute to Iron Maiden&quot;, performing vocals for the Iron Maiden classic &quot;Wasted Years&quot;. Snider was joined by his contemporaries and peers George Lynch, formerly of Dokken, and Bob Kulick. Also in 2005, the band released the 2003 Wacken show on CD and DVD simply titled &quot;Live at Wacken&quot;. It also went on tour with Alice Cooper, acting as the support band but delivering a set similar to a headliner&#x27;s.

In 2006, Snider and French worked with Lordi to produce and play on a few tracks on their new album &quot;The Arockalypse&quot;. Snider was featured on the first track, &quot;SCG3 Special Report&quot;, as the voice of Lordi warning of the upcoming &quot;Arockalypse&quot;. French guest starred on the song &quot;Chainsaw Buffet&quot;. In June 2006, the band announced that it had signed with the American record label Razor and Tie to release a final album, of heavy metal Christmas music, called &quot;A Twisted Christmas&quot;. The album was released on October 17, 2006, and was a commercial success. On July 8, 2006, Twisted Sister played in front of 80,000 people in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The show featured Scorpions as the headliner. It also played a small concert at the Wolverhampton Civic Center.

Before each of the main shows, they would perform as Bent Brother, practicing their set and appearing without makeup, usually at reduced ticket prices.

Twisted Sister was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame on October 15, 2006. On December 13, 2006, Twisted Sister made an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. The group performed its rock version of &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot;, which is arranged in the style of &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot;. On December 22, 2006, Twisted Sister performed the song on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;. On an episode of Snider&#x27;s syndicated radio program &quot;The House of Hair&quot;, he stated that due to the success of the Christmas album, and also due to the response to the tour promoting the album, that Twisted Sister might not retire, and the band&#x27;s future was being discussed.

On July 15, 2007, Twisted Sister performed at metal festival Rocklahoma.

Twisted Sister&#x27;s &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot; was featured in the game &quot;Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s&quot; as a playable song (instead of being a cover like several songs featured in the game, it was the version from the 2004 remake of the group&#x27;s classic album &quot;Stay Hungry&quot;, titled &quot;Still Hungry&quot;).

In 2008, Snider appeared on the CMT television show &quot;Gone Country&quot;. On February 25, 2008, Twisted Sister performed at &quot;Aftermath - The Station Fire 5 years later&quot; in Providence, Rhode Island. On May 10, 2008, Twisted Sister performed a free concert at the Bulgarian town Lovech. On July 13, 2008, Twisted Sister performed at Snatch Rock n Roll Lounge, in Calgary, Alberta. On September 1, 2008, Twisted Sister performed at the Rock The Bayou Festival in Houston, Texas.

On June 4, 2009, Twisted Sister performed &quot;Stay Hungry&quot; in its entirety for the first time at the Sweden Rock Festival. This included never before played songs such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Horror-Teria: Street Justice&quot;.

On July 16, 2009, in an interview on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, Snider said that 2009 was the last year that the band would perform with makeup and costumes.

On February 16, 2010, Twisted Sister were confirmed to play at Bloodstock Open Air 2010.

On July 15, 2011, Twisted Sister were confirmed to play at Masters of Rock.

Twisted Sister performed at Copenhell 2014 in Denmark to an audience of 20,000 as part of the group&#x27;s Stay Hungry 30th Anniversary World Tour. This was the group&#x27;s first show in Denmark in 30 years. The Twisted Sister show was praised as one of the best concert performances. The band was &quot;..As Sharp, Crazy and Witty as 30 years ago&quot; according to the Danish press.

On October 13, 2011, the band announced a five-disc DVD set of live performances over the group&#x27;s entire career entitled &quot;From the Bars to the Stars&quot;, with a release date of November 8.

Former Twisted Sister drummer Richard Teeter, who had played with the band in 1980 and 1981, died from complications due to esophageal cancer on April 10, 2012.

===Death of A. J. Pero and farewell tour (2015–2016)===
On March 20, 2015, drummer A. J. Pero died in his sleep of a heart attack. Twisted Sister released the following statement: &quot;The members of Twisted Sister are profoundly saddened to announce the untimely passing of our brother, AJ Pero. The band, crew and most importantly the family of AJ Pero thank you for your thoughts and prayers at this time.&quot; Shortly thereafter, Adrenaline Mob, which also featured Pero on drums, released a statement revealing that Pero had died while sleeping on the band&#x27;s tour bus.

On April 7, 2015, TMZ.com reported that Twisted Sister would embark on its final tour, dubbed &quot;Forty and Fuck It&quot;, in 2016. Mike Portnoy (of The Winery Dogs and Transatlantic and formerly of Dream Theater and Adrenaline Mob) filled in for Pero on drums on this tour. The band also announced tribute shows in honor of A. J. Pero; the first was in Las Vegas, Nevada, on May 30 and was recorded for the CD/DVD release &quot;Metal Meltdown—Featuring Twisted Sister Live at The Hard Rock Casino—Las Vegas&quot;, released that July. The second was dubbed &quot;Twisted Sister – A Concert to Honor AJ Pero&quot; and held in Sayreville, New Jersey on June 13. On this tour a recording of a drum solo, from one of AJ&#x27;s last concerts with Twisted Sister, was shown on the stage screen, giving the fans one final experience of the classic line-up together. The recording was from the Faroe Islands Summarfestival. The group played its final concert on November 12, 2016 in Monterrey.

===Metal Hall of Fame induction and potential reunion shows (2023–present)===
On January 26, 2023, Twisted Sister reunited as they were inducted into the Metal Hall of Fame at The Canyon Club in Agoura Hills. At the event, they performed a special one-off onstage three–song set once again featuring drummer Mike Portnoy filling in for A. J. Pero and guitarist Keith Robert War, who filled in for Eddie Ojeda after contracting COVID-19.

On April 7, 2023 Dee Snider announced the band will reunite in 2024 for appearances at various Democratic political rallies during the 2024 election season. On April 8, 2024 Snider stated to podcast &quot;The Hook Rocks!&quot; that offers the band are receiving for a reunion are &quot;&quot;getting close to being impossible to refuse&quot;. Although he reiterated that the numbers are &quot;not there yet&quot; but they &quot;sure as hell seem to be going in that direction&quot;&quot;.

Mark Mendoza is currently working on writing for radio and film ( The Song Alliance ) with his partner Marla Adler ( Who do you Love )Bernard Wright , female Lead Vocals..EMI ) 
They have just released several songs including
“I’m Your Christmas Present “ on all platforms.

==Musical style and influences==
Twisted Sister is generally classified as heavy metal, glam metal, and hard rock. They have also been called a shock rock band. Despite its classification as glam metal, Greg Prato of AllMusic compared the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Under the Blade&quot; to early 1980s new wave of British heavy metal. Moreover, despite the disdain that thrash metal musicians and fans in the 1980s had towards glam metal, Twisted Sister bridged the gap and could appeal to both thrash metal and glam metal fans, with thrash metal band Metallica even opening for Twisted Sister in the 1980s, despite Metallica&#x27;s disdain for glam metal music at the time. Thrash metal bands Anthrax and Overkill had covered Twisted Sister songs. Snider spoke about this, saying:

Snider rejected the glam metal label of the band, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t think Twisted Sister is &#x27;Glam&#x27; because that implies glamour, and we&#x27;re not glamorous. We should be called &#x27;Hid&#x27; because we&#x27;re hideous.&quot; In interviews, Dee Snider cited Slade, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, KISS, Grand Funk Railroad, Black Sabbath, the Rolling Stones, Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders, the Monkees, Alice Cooper, Aerosmith, David Bowie, Queen, Van Halen and AC/DC as influences. Snider underscored Slade and said: &quot;If not for the [English glam rock] band Slade, there would be no &#x27;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&#x27;.&quot;

<text>A commemorative coin is a coin issued to commemorate some particular event or issue with a distinct design with reference to the occasion on which they were issued. Many coins of this category serve as collector&#x27;s items only, although some countries also issue commemorative coins for regular circulation.

== Subcategories ==
Commemorative coins can be seen as being of one of three types:

*&quot;Regular issue coinage&quot; are the normal coins intended to be used in commerce every day and are typically issued with the same design for several years, e.g. euro coins.
*&quot;Circulating commemoratives&quot; are intended to be used for commerce, but the design will only be issued for a limited time to commemorate an event, anniversary, person or location, among other items. Examples include the €2 commemorative coins and U.S. 50 State Quarters.
*&quot;Non-circulating legal tender (NCLT)&quot; are coins which are legal tender, and thus can in theory be used to purchase goods or services, but are not intended to be used in such a manner. Rather, they are intended as collector&#x27;s items with numismatic value, and are often produced in gold or silver, either in uncirculated condition or with a proof finish.

== History ==

Historically, the coins issued by any state have always reflected the current political or economic situation. Many ancient and pre-modern coins certainly commemorate events in contemporary times. For instance, Roman coins often have references to military campaigns and the defeat of foreign powers. These reverse types often symbolically represent the subordination of recently conquered territories to Roman authority. Such coins are examples of ancient political propaganda. The Roman Empire may be represented by a proud warrior &#x27;raising&#x27; an undersized figure, representing the defeated enemy.

Throughout history, coins have commonly been issued on special occasions, without necessarily citing that occasion explicitly. In some cases, emergency money have been issued under unfavourable conditions, such as a city under siege. Such emergency coins were issued in Vienna in 1529, while the city was besieged by the troops of the Ottoman Empire. Due to the conditions at the time, such coins are frequently minted on square flans, rather than round ones (it was easier and quicker to produce a square flan than a round one). European square coins of this era are known by their German name &#x27;klippe&#x27;. Coins might also be issued with the specific purpose of financing a military campaign, or for the payment of tribute or war indemnity by a feudal lord to his sovereign.

During recent centuries, specially prepared coins have been issued to proclaim the coronation of a new monarch. Such coins are known as &#x27;largesse&#x27; coins. This type of coins were issued in India during the Mughal era (the &#x27;nisar&#x27; coinage), and in Europe in the age of absolutism. In Europe, such coins were scattered from the royal chariot, to achieve attention and applause from the public. In Sweden, coins of this type were issued as late as 1873 (known as &quot;kastpenning&quot;).

During the era of the formation of the European nation states, the issuance of special coins explicitly commemorating various events became increasingly common. These coins were frequently devised to establish a public notion of nationhood, and also to honor the ruling monarch and his dynasty. During the economically exhausting Napoleonic wars, a one sixth rigsdaler was issued in Denmark from voluntary contributions from the public, intended to finance the creation of a new fleet. Another notable coin is the Prussian thaler of 1871, commemorating the victory of the Franco-Prussian war, opening the gates for the Prussian king to be crowned as Emperor of the unified German nation. After the (political and monetary) unification of Germany, some German states continued issuing separate coins on special occasions, such as the jubilee of a ruling monarch. The issuance of these royal jubilee coins became common throughout Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century. In some cases, these became collector items already at the time of their minting.

Before World War II, commemorative coins were always made of precious metals. The base metal coins were probably not considered appropriate for, or worthy of, honoring the nation or the ruling dynasty. However, during the 20th century, the use of precious metals for circulating currency became increasingly scarce. World War I and the world economic crisis of the 1930s brought about temporary or permanent abolition of the convertibility of bank notes to silver and gold coins. Gradually, the issuance of precious metal coins became increasingly restricted, and definitively abandoned about 1970. While the commemoratives of these decades continued to be issued predominantly in precious metals, their use as circulating currency became scarce or ceased entirely. Thus, the commemoratives developed into a separate class of coins with no immediately recognisable link to the coins and notes used in everyday transactions. This class of coins were collectors items, or in some cases objects for economic investment.

When West Germany replaced the silver 5 mark coin with a copper-nickel one in 1975, the silver 5 mark commemoratives also reverted to copper-nickel (in 1979). Already in 1965, the Soviet Union issued a copper-nickel-zinc rouble commemorating the victory in World War II. This, and the next four commemorative roubles, were issued in several millions of copies, and circulated as regular currency.

In the United Kingdom, before decimalisation of the money system in 1971, the usual commemorative coin was a crown, or five shilling piece. These were issued to mark coronations of monarchs; one was also issued on the occasion of the death of Winston Churchill. Some decimal crowns (worth 25 pence) were issued, but since 1990 the £5 has been the usual non circulating commemorative coin. Other denominations such as the 50 pence and £2 are issued as circulating commemoratives.

 The circulating and non-circulating commemoratives may be issued jointly, but have quite different purposes. Denmark, for instance, has since 1990 developed a pattern of issuing aluminium bronze 20 kroner commemoratives and accompanying silver 200 krone commemoratives. The aluminium bronze coins are circulating along with the non-commemorative 20 krone coins, while the silver coins are never circulated. The circulating commemoratives brings variation into the circulating coin mass, while the silver coins are collectors items and a source of revenue for the state. Likewise, in East Germany, some commemorative coins were issued with a primary purpose of earning foreign currency, while others actually circulated, albeit in smaller quantity than the bank notes of the corresponding denominations.

== Significance of non-circulating commemoratives ==
Many countries issue large quantities of non-circulating legal tender purely for seigniorage as a profit making exercise. The events that these coins commemorate are often chosen based on a perceived market, rather than events of significance to the country. Technology developed for non circulating coins has moved to circulation issues - coloured coins were first issued as non circulating legal tender, but Canada and Australia have issued coloured commemorative coins into circulation.

<text>The Scarecrow of Oz is the ninth book in the Oz series written by L. Frank Baum. Published on July 16, 1915, it was Baum&#x27;s personal favorite of the Oz books and tells of Cap&#x27;n Bill and Trot journeying to Oz and, with the help of the Scarecrow, overthrowing the corrupt King Krewl of Jinxland. Cap&#x27;n Bill and Trot (Mayre Griffiths) had previously appeared in two other novels by Baum, &quot;The Sea Fairies&quot; (1911) and &quot;Sky Island&quot; (1912). 

The plot is a re-working of Baum&#x27;s 1914 silent film, &quot;His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Rinkitink in Oz&quot; (1916).

==Plot summary==

Cap&#x27;n Bill, a sailor with a wooden peg-leg, and his friend, a little girl named Trot, set out from California on a calm day for a short ride in their row-boat. A freak whirlpool capsizes their boat and pulls them under water, where they are carried by mermaids (referred to but not seen) to a cave. They are soon joined by a flying creature called an Ork. Passing through a dark tunnel out of the cave, the three arrive at an island inhabited by a grim man calling himself Pessim the Observer. Cap&#x27;n Bill and Trot reduce their size by eating magic shrinking-berries, and the Ork carries them away from the island to the land of Mo, where they eat another type of magic berries and resume their normal size.

They meet the Bumpy Man, who specializes in serving sugar and molasses and has some of their appearance too. They run into Button Bright, the boy from &quot;The Road to Oz&quot; who has gotten lost again. Cap&#x27;n Bill calls down some of the native birds (who, like all birds in fairy countries, can talk back) and offers them the &quot;growing&quot; berries to make them large enough to carry himself, Trot, and Button-Bright to the land of Oz. When they make it across the desert, Button-Bright, Cap&#x27;n Bill, and Trot are set down in a field and the Ork leaves them to find his own country, which he got lost from on a routine flight.

The place Button-Bright, Cap&#x27;n Bill, and Trot have arrived in, Jinxland, is cut off from the rest of Oz by a range of high mountains and a bottomless crevice. The kingdom has had a turbulent recent history. The rightful king of Jinxland, King Kynd, was removed by his prime minister Phearse, who was in turn removed by his prime minister Krewl who now rules over the land. An unpleasant but wealthy citizen named Googly-Goo seeks to marry King Kynd&#x27;s daughter, Princess Gloria; however, she is in love with Pon, the current gardener&#x27;s boy, who is the son of the first usurper Phearse. King Krewl and Googly-Goo hire a witch named Blinkie to freeze Gloria&#x27;s heart so that she will no longer love Pon. Cap&#x27;n Bill happens on this plot, and to keep him from interfering, Blinkie turns him into a grasshopper. She then freezes Gloria&#x27;s heart. Googly-Goo proposes to her, but now that her heart is frozen, she does not love anyone at all, including Googly-Goo, whose proposal she scornfully declines.

The Scarecrow is at Glinda&#x27;s palace in the Quadling Country and learns about these events from reading Glinda&#x27;s Great Book of Records, a magical volume which transcribes every event in the world at the instant it happens. The Scarecrow wants to help Cap&#x27;n Bill, Button-Bright, and Trot, and Glinda sends him to Jinxland with some of her magic to aid him. The Scarecrow travels to Jinxland and joins forces with Trot, Cap&#x27;n Bill (who is still a grasshopper), and the Ork, who flies off to his homeland for reinforcements. The Scarecrow attempts to depose Krewl and is captured, with Googly-Goo suggesting the Scarecrow be burned, but then the Ork arrives just in time with fifty other Orks, who attack the Jinxlanders and turn the tables on Krewl. The victorious party then arrives at Blinkie&#x27;s and makes her undo her magic on Cap&#x27;n Bill and Princess Gloria by using a magic powder to shrink her in size. When she has undone her evil spells, the Scarecrow stops Blinkie&#x27;s shrinking, but she remains at a small size and loses all her magic powers.

Gloria takes the throne of Jinxland and elevates Pon to be her royal , and the Scarecrow, Button-Bright, Cap&#x27;n Bill, Trot, and the Orks return to the Emerald City for a celebration.

==Background==
The novel is dedicated to &quot;The Uplifters&quot; of Los Angeles. The Lofty and Exalted Order of Uplifters, a select subgroup of the elite Los Angeles Athletic Club, was a social and fraternal organization of prominent southern California businessmen and public figures. Baum had been active in the group since he first moved to Los Angeles in 1909 and served among the Excelsiors, the group&#x27;s governing board. He also wrote and acted in their shows and he played the bass drum in their band.

A small group of Uplifters were the key investors in The Oz Film Manufacturing Company, organized to make movies of Baum books and stories. The investors put up $100,000; Baum was named president, and received a block of stock in the company in payment for the cinema rights to his works. The company&#x27;s first project was a film of &quot;The Patchwork Girl of Oz;&quot; and its second, released in October 1914, was &quot;His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz&quot;, produced at a cost of $23,500, and with a cast (according to the not-always factually reliable Baum) of 130.

Baum hoped that the movie would be a success, and provide a big publicity boost to the &quot;Scarecrow&quot; novel to follow in 1915. Things did not quite work out as the optimistic author hoped; the film did not earn enough to cover its costs. The first edition of the novel sold around 14,300 copies, only a couple hundred more than its predecessor, &quot;Tik-Tok of Oz&quot;—though in the long run &quot;The Scarecrow of Oz&quot; would be one of the more popular installments in the Oz series.

Like &quot;Tik-Tok,&quot; &quot;Scarecrow&quot; contains a significant romantic element—the Rose Princess and Private Files in the former, and Gloria and Pon in the latter—that was not typical of the earlier Oz books. 

Although the journey of an American child to Oz had long been a favorite plot for Baum, this work represented its last appearance: no more children would be inducted into Oz for the duration of his work on the series.

The Ork, voiced by Peter MacNicol, appeared in an episode of &quot;The Oz Kids&quot;.

<text>The United States Mint has minted numerous commemorative coins to commemorate persons, places, events, and institutions since 1848. Many of these coins are not intended for general circulation, but are still legal tender. The mint also produces commemorative medals, which are similar to coins but do not have a face value, and therefore are not legal tender.

==History==

=== Early commemoratives ===
The earliest commemorative coin minted by the US Mint was the 1848 &quot;CAL&quot; quarter eagle, which commemorated the finding of gold in California. These coins were standard quarter eagles that were modified by punching &quot;CAL.&quot; onto the reverse above the eagle.

Most standard US commemorative coin lists begin with the 1892 Columbian half dollar commemorating the 400th anniversary of Columbus&#x27; voyage to America. The following year, the Columbian Exposition quarter dollar featuring Queen Isabella of Spain was issued.

In 1915, the mint issued the Panama–Pacific half union, which had a face value of $50. This was the first time a commemorative coin was produced in a denomination that was not issued for circulation (a half union coin was proposed, but was never released into circulation). The coin was offered in both round and octagonal versions, the latter being the only US coin that is not round.

In 1925, a commemorative 50-cent coin was released that showed Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Money raised from the sale of the coins was combined with money raised by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial Association in order to fund the carving of a Confederate monument at Stone Mountain.

The 1926 United States Sesquicentennial half dollar was the second United States coin to feature a living person at the time of its minting. The obverse of the coin featured busts of George Washington and Calvin Coolidge. (The first was the 1921 Alabama Centennial half dollar, which showed a bust of then-Governor Thomas Kilby.) Coolidge remains the only president depicted on coinage during his lifetime.

Starting in the 1930s, the US Mint was criticized for issuing commemorative coins of dubious recognition and seemingly endless mint runs (the Oregon Trail Memorial 50-cent piece was minted 8 years during a 14-year span). Multiple unrelated commemoratives also were minted in many years, diminishing the significance of commemorative issues. In 1936 alone 19 commemorative half dollars were minted, not including two half dollars that were dated 1936 but were actually minted the following year. Three commemorative half dollars were proposed for issue in 1954, but all were vetoed by president Dwight D. Eisenhower due to the lack of interest expressed by collectors, and the period of early commemoratives ended that year with the 1954 Carver-Washington half dollar.

=== Modern commemoratives ===
In 1982, the US Mint resumed its commemorative coin program with the George Washington 250th Anniversary half dollar. Unlike the original commemoratives, only a few coins are released each year and are more popular with collectors.

The Library of Congress eagle of 2000 was the first bi-metallic coin issued by the US Mint. Later that year, the mint released a 1,000 Icelandic króna coin commemorating the 1,000th anniversary of Leif Ericson&#x27;s discovery of the Americas. This coin was struck on the same planchet as the silver dollar that also commemorated the event.

The year 2017 marked the 225th anniversary of the US Mint. Although no traditional commemorative coins were issued for the occasion, the mint did produce a $100 coin, a special uncirculated mint set featuring coins with an &quot;enhanced&quot; finish, and a circulating penny featuring the &quot;P&quot; mint mark.

== Circulating commemorative coins ==

Circulating commemorative coins have been somewhat more unusual in the United States. These are coins that are minted to commemorate a particular person, place, event, or institution, but are intended to enter general circulation.

All US Bicentennial commemoratives were dated 1776–1976, despite being produced throughout 1975–76.

=== Dollar coins ===

The first commemorative coin of the United States made specifically as a circulation issue was the 1921 Peace dollar. The coin was originally intended to be produced for one year to commemorate the end of World War I, although the design proved popular and continued to be produced until silver dollar production ended in 1935.

In 1975 and 1976, the Eisenhower dollar was issued for circulation, among other commemorative coins in those years.

The Susan B. Anthony dollar was minted from 1979 to 1981, and then again in 1999.

The Dolley Madison silver dollar was available to buy in 1999, made to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Dolley Madison’s death.

The Presidential dollar coins, the first of which was released in 2007, commemorate deceased presidents of the United States. The program ended in 2016 when the last eligible president, Ronald Reagan, was commemorated (a George H. W. Bush coin was released in 2020).

2009 saw the release of the first Native American dollar coin, to depict &quot;images celebrating the important contributions made by Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to the development of the United States and the history of the United States.&quot; The act also called for the removal of the date from the obverse and &quot;&quot; from the reverse of the coin, opting instead to add them to the edge.

In 2018, the American Innovation $1 Coin Program was launched. The program will run from 2019 to 2032, commemorating an inventor or an invention from each state and six territories. An introductory coin was released in 2018. These coins do not circulate as of 2019, as no dollar coins have been minted for circulation since 2012 due to a lack of demand. Should there be a need for more dollar coins before 2032, however, some American Innovation dollars may enter circulation.

=== Half dollars ===

Several issues of commemorative half dollars were released into circulation to initially poor sales. The next planned circulating commemorative coin was a half dollar to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth of George Washington. The coin was to have been struck for one year only in 1932, however, no circulating half dollars were struck from 1930 until 1934 due to a lack of demand caused by the Great Depression. The anniversary was instead commemorated with the Washington quarter, which, like the Peace dollar, later became a regular issue coin.

The Kennedy half dollar, first released in March 1964 as a memorial to the assassinated 35th president of the United States John F. Kennedy, became hoarded by collectors, and those interested in a memento of the late president, and for the silver content of the coin, and were seldom seen in circulation despite increased production and periodic decrease of silver content. A special design for the reverse of the half dollar was issued for the United States Bicentennial, struck. Production of the circulating coin was then ended in 2001, but in 2021 began again to be produced for general circulation.

=== Quarters ===

In 1975 and 1976, the Washington quarter was issued and circulated to commemorate the United States Bicentennial.

In 1999, the State Quarters program began circulating five different commemoratives each year with reverses for each of the 50 States in the order of their admission to the Union. In 2009, six quarters commemorating the District of Columbia, two commonwealths, and three territories were issued.

Beginning in 2010 and continuing through 2021, a series of quarters, the America the Beautiful Quarters, was issued to recognize America&#x27;s National Parks, with five quarters issued per year.

The American Women quarters program, authorized by the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, sponsored by Representatives Barbara Lee and Anthony Gonzalez, will comprise a series featuring notable women in U.S. history, commemorating the centennial of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The United States Mint will issue up to five designs each year from 2022 to 2025 for up to 20 total designs. One woman will be honored on the reverse of each coin, selected for &quot;contributions to the United States in a wide spectrum of accomplishments and fields, including but not limited to suffrage, civil rights, abolition, government, humanities, science, space, and arts.&quot; The obverse will depict George Washington with a new design. Honorees for 2022 are:Maya Angelou - January 2022, Sally Ride - March 2022, Wilma Mankiller - June 2022, Adelina Otero-Warren, and Anna May Wong.

=== Nickels ===

In 2004–2005 the mint issued four commemorative Westward Journey nickels, celebrating the 200th anniversaries of the Louisiana Purchase and the Corps of Discovery.

=== One cent coins ===

In 2009, four commemorative one cent pieces were issued to mark the bicentennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.

<text>&quot;It&#x27;s a &quot;Good&quot; Life&quot; is a short story by American writer Jerome Bixby, written in 1953. In 1970, the Science Fiction Writers of America selected it for &quot;The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One&quot;, as one of the 20 best short stories in science fiction published prior to the Nebula Award. The story was first published in &quot;Star Science Fiction Stories No.2&quot;. The story was adapted in 1961 into an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Anthony Fremont is a three-year-old boy with near-godlike powers: He can transform other people, animals or objects into anything he wishes, think new things into being, teleport himself and others where he wishes, read the minds of people and animals and even revive the dead. His appearance is never completely described; the story mentions his &quot;odd shadow&quot; and &quot;bright, wet, purple gaze&quot;, and the obstetrician at his birth was said to have &quot;screamed and dropped him and tried to kill him&quot;. The town&#x27;s children are told that Anthony is a &quot;nice goblin&quot;, but they must never go near him.

Anthony&#x27;s powers were present at birth, as he was able to kill the obstetrician and then, instinctively, separate his birthplace, the town of Peaksville, Ohio, from the rest of Earth moments after he was born. Nobody knows whether Anthony transported Peaksville somewhere or whether the rest of the world was destroyed and only the town remains.

There is no electricity, and the residents have to make their own things and grow their own food; the latter is somewhat difficult, as Anthony changes the weather according to his whims. The adults must satisfy Anthony&#x27;s every whim, or risk displeasing him. Nobody is safe from Anthony, not even his own family, although they can sometimes influence him slightly; after a &quot;smiling&quot; suggestion from his father, Anthony sends the remains of his victims into graves in the family cornfield, after he has finished with them.

As Anthony can read minds, the town&#x27;s population must not only act content with the situation when near him, but also think they are happy at all times. However, the story does not present Anthony as malevolent or evil; he is simply a three-year-old boy with any young child&#x27;s limited grasp of the world, yet with god-like powers. Even his sincere attempts to help those in need often go horribly awry, which is why everyone acts as if everything is &quot;good&quot; no matter what — any change Anthony makes could be much worse. Since Anthony can act immediately on any whim, those he dislikes can come to a quick and nasty end, even if he regrets it later, and no one dares suggest he undo what he has done, since the results could be worse still.

The story mostly takes place during a surprise birthday party for the Fremonts&#x27; neighbor, Dan Hollis. The residents take turns passing around certain objects, like books, music or furniture, since they cannot acquire anything new from the outside world. Dan receives a newly discovered Perry Como record for his birthday and wants to play it right away, but as Anthony does not like singing, the others advise him to wait until he gets home. Dan gets drunk and begins demanding that they sing, first &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; and then &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;. Angrily he turns on Anthony&#x27;s parents, crying, &quot;You had to go and &quot;have&quot; him&quot;, then he defiantly continues to sing as Anthony appears in the room. Anthony decides Dan is a &quot;bad man&quot; and turns him into something horrific, &quot;something like nothing anyone would have believed possible&quot;, before &quot;thinking&quot; him deep into the cornfield.

Because Anthony&#x27;s Aunt Amy carelessly complained about the heat earlier, the next day Anthony makes it snow, which &quot;killed off half the crops — but it was a &quot;good&quot; day&quot;.

==Reception==
Floyd C. Gale in 1961 called the story a &quot;super-duper topnotcher&quot;. In 1986, it was included in the anthology &quot;Isaac Asimov Presents The Great SF Stories 15&quot; as one of the best science fiction short stories of 1953.

In 2004, the story was a finalist for the 1954 Retro-Hugo Award for Best Short Story.

==Adaptations==
* &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot; (&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;), a 1961 episode of the 1959 TV series
* &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot;, the third segment; a remake of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life&quot; in &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983). In this version, Anthony (no last name given) is depicted as eight (he is three in the original story and six in the original episode). He uses his powers to cater to himself and his &quot;family&quot;, who are revealed to be random people that he has manipulated and held against their will. Anthony&#x27;s real sister is crippled and has no mouth because she made Anthony mad. His real parents wanted to &quot;send Anthony away&quot; and are now simply gone. This depiction of Anthony is a much more sympathetic and tragic character who only wants people not to be afraid of him. He also is shown to love cartoons, making it the only thing everyone watches with televisions in every room in the house. According to Anthony &quot;anything can happen in cartoons&quot; and that he himself &quot;can do anything. ANYthing!&quot;
* &quot;Treehouse of Horror II&quot;, the 7th episode of the third season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The second segment is a parody of the original &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode, with Bart in the role of Anthony.
* &quot;It&#x27;s Still a Good Life&quot;, the 31st episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (2002 TV series) which acts as a sequel to the episode in the 1959 TV series, with Bill Mumy and Cloris Leachman reprising roles from the original episode.
*&quot;Johnny Real Good&quot;, from the 12th episode of the first season of &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; which stands more as a parody of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode. Johnny must babysit a boy with god-like powers who constantly teleports him into a nearby cornfield for thinking bad thoughts.

<text>Ian Ernest Gilmore Evans (né Green; May 13, 1912 – March 20, 1988) was a Canadian–American jazz pianist, arranger, composer and bandleader. He is widely recognized as one of the greatest orchestrators in jazz, playing an important role in the development of cool jazz, modal jazz, free jazz, and jazz fusion. He is best known for his acclaimed collaborations with Miles Davis.

==Early life==
Gil Evans was born in Toronto, Canada, on May 13, 1912, to Margaret Julia McConnachy. Little is known about Evans&#x27;s biological father, although a family friend said that he was a doctor who died before Evans was born. Originally named Gilmore Ian Ernest Green, Evans took the last name of his step-father, John Evans, a miner. The family moved frequently, living in Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon, migrating to wherever Evans&#x27;s father could find work. Eventually, the family ended up in California, first in Berkeley, where Evans attended the ninth and tenth grades, then in Stockton, where he attended Stockton High School, graduating in 1930. During this time, Evans&#x27;s father took a job with the Western Pacific Railroad, and Evans began living with friends, later renting a room in a boarding house. After graduating, Evans attended the College of the Pacific in Stockton, where he founded his first jazz big band, Gil Evans &amp; His Orchestra, in 1933, but then transferred to Modesto Junior College. After a year in Modesto, Evans left and moved back to Stockton.

Evans became interested in music at an early age, listening to Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Fletcher Henderson on the radio and on records. He studied the piano and began learning how to arrange music, and started picking up jobs with local musicians. While in college, he founded his first band, which performed his arrangements, and which became the house band at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa Beach, California, in 1935. The band toured the Pacific Northwest in 1937 and eventually settled in Hollywood, where they regularly performed on Bob Hope&#x27;s radio show. Evans&#x27;s arrangements from this time showed the influence of classical music, and included instruments such as French horns, flutes, and tubas. In 1939, Claude Thornhill was hired for Hope&#x27;s show, and he became a major influence on Evans.

Evans remained a Canadian citizen until he entered the US Army during the second World War. After 1946, he lived and worked primarily in New York City, living for many years at Westbeth Artists Community.

==Career==
Between 1941 and 1948, Evans worked as an arranger for the Claude Thornhill Orchestra. Even then, early in his career, his arrangements were such a challenge to musicians that bassist Bill Crow recalled that bandleader Thornhill would bring out Evans&#x27;s arrangements &quot;when he wanted to punish the band.&quot; Evans&#x27;s modest basement apartment behind a New York City Chinese laundry soon became a meeting place for musicians looking to develop new musical styles outside of the dominant bebop style of the day. Those present included the leading bebop performer, Charlie Parker, as well as Gerry Mulligan and John Carisi. 

In 1948, Evans, with Miles Davis, Mulligan, and others, collaborated on a band book for a nonet. These ensembles, larger than the trio-to-quintet combos, but smaller than big bands which were on the brink of economic unviability, allowed arrangers to have a larger palette of colors by using French horns and tuba. Claude Thornhill had employed hornist John Graas in 1942, and composer-arranger Bob Graettinger had scored for horns and tubas with the Stan Kenton orchestra, but the &quot;Kenton sound&quot; was in the context of a dense orchestral wall of sound that Evans avoided. The Miles Davis-led group was booked for a week at the Royal Roost as an intermission group on the bill with the Count Basie Orchestra. Capitol Records recorded 12 numbers by the nonet at three sessions in 1949 and 1950. These recordings were reissued on a 1957 Miles Davis LP titled &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;.

Later, while Davis was under contract with Columbia Records, producer George Avakian suggested that Davis could work with any of several arrangers. Davis immediately chose Evans. The three albums that resulted from the collaboration are &quot;Miles Ahead&quot; (1957), &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1958), and &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; (1960). Another collaboration from this period, &quot;Quiet Nights&quot; (1962) was issued later, against the wishes of Davis, who broke with his then-producer Teo Macero for a time as a result. Although these four records were marketed primarily under Davis&#x27;s name (and credited to &quot;Miles Davis with Orchestra Under the Direction of Gil Evans&quot;), Evans&#x27;s contribution was as important as Davis&#x27;s. Their work coupled Evans&#x27;s classic big band jazz stylings and arrangements with Davis&#x27;s solo playing. Evans also contributed behind the scenes to Davis&#x27;s classic quintet albums of the 1960s.

The demands of the score for &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; were legendary, from the very first note for the lead trumpet. The limited time allotted for rehearsals revealed that the ability to read such a challenging score was not consistent among jazz musicians, and there are many audible errors. Yet the recording is now regarded by many as one of the greatest reinterpretations of Gershwin&#x27;s music in any musical style, because Evans and Davis were each devoted to going outside the &quot;mainstream&quot; of commercial expectations for jazz musicians. Evans was a great influence on Davis&#x27;s interest in &quot;non-jazz&quot; music, especially orchestral music. Unfortunately, Evans&#x27;s orchestral scores from the &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; sessions were later found to be incomplete (or simply lost), and Quincy Jones and Gil Goldstein attempted to reconstruct these for Miles Davis&#x27;s final 1991 concerts at Montreux, recorded as &quot;Miles &amp; Quincy Live at Montreux&quot;. Davis had relented after years of refusing to revisit this material, but he was clearly ill, recovering from pneumonia, and trumpeter Wallace Roney, who was mentored by Davis, covered many of the challenging passages. Davis died before the release of the album.

From 1957 onwards, Evans recorded albums under his own name. Tubist Bill Barber and trumpeter Louis Mucci from Thornhill&#x27;s band were both stalwarts in Evans&#x27;s early ensembles, with Mucci finding a spot on nearly every pre-1980s Evans recording. Among the featured soloists on these records were Lee Konitz, Jimmy Cleveland, Steve Lacy, Johnny Coles and Cannonball Adderley. In 1965, he arranged the big band tracks on Kenny Burrell&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Forms&quot; album.

Evans was influenced by Spanish composers Manuel de Falla and Joaquín Rodrigo, and by other Latin and Brazilian music, as well as by German expatriate Kurt Weill. His arrangements of pieces already well known to some listeners from their original cabaret, concert hall or Broadway stage arrangements, revealed aspects of the music in a wholly original way. Sometimes in an unexpected contrast to the original atmosphere of the piece, and sometimes taking a dark ballad such as Weill&#x27;s &quot;Barbara Song&quot; into an even darker place. 

The personnel list for &quot;The Individualism of Gil Evans&quot; (1964), not only features Bill Barber and hornists James Buffington and Julius Watkins (along with two others), but each section features the cream of the younger (some more classically trained) musicians who were making their names in jazz. The presence of four of the most acclaimed young bassists (Richard Davis, Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, and Ben Tucker) along with veteran Milt Hinton would ordinarily indicate that each is used individually for separate tracks, but Evans&#x27;s scores usually required at least two bassists on any given track, some playing &quot;arco&quot; (with the bow) and some &quot;pizzicato&quot; (plucking with fingers, the standard jazz method). These arrangements frequently featured greatly slowed-down tempos with polyrhythmic percussion and no prevailing &quot;beat&quot;. To his by-now standard French horns and tuba, Evans&#x27;s scores added alto and bass flutes, double reeds, and harp; orchestral instruments not associated with &quot;swing&quot; bands, providing a larger palette of orchestral colors, and allowing him to attain the ethereal quality heard in his arrangements during his Thornhill days. He frequently wrote a part for the tenor violin of Harry Lookofsky. Yet, this album featured an orchestral arrangement of &quot;Spoonful&quot; by bluesman Willie Dixon, an early indication of Evans&#x27;s breadth and a hint of things to come.

In 1966, he recorded an album with Brazilian singer Astrud Gilberto, &quot;Look to the Rainbow&quot;. He was discouraged by the commercial direction Verve Records was taking with the Gilberto sessions, and he went into a period of hiatus.

During this period while he was somewhat depressed about the commercial and logistical difficulties of his previous scoring requirements, his wife suggested that he listen to the guitarist Jimi Hendrix. Evans developed a particular interest in the work of the rock guitarist. Evans gradually built another orchestra in the 1970s, with none of the coloration instruments from his past arrangements. Working in the free jazz and jazz-rock idioms, he gained a new generation of admirers. These ensembles, rarely more than fifteen and frequently smaller, allowed him to make more contributions on keyboards, and with the development of truly portable synthesizers, he began using these to provide additional color. Hendrix&#x27;s 1970 death precluded a scheduled meeting with Evans to discuss having Hendrix collaborate with a big band led by Evans.
In 1974, he released an album of his, and other band members&#x27;, arrangements of music by Hendrix with guitarists John Abercrombie and Ryo Kawasaki. From then on Evans&#x27;s ensembles featured electric instruments, i.e. guitars, basses, and synthesizers including a collaboration with bassist Jaco Pastorius &quot;Gil Evans &amp; Jaco Pastorius – Live Under The Sky Tokyo &#x27;84&quot;. In contrast to his intricate scores for large ensembles, which required precision orchestral playing accompanying a single soloist, his later arrangements would feature more unison playing by the entire ensemble, such as on Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Little Wing&quot;, with improvisational touches added throughout by the musicians. Live recordings demonstrate that some entire pieces were collaborative efforts, and Evans can be heard giving cues from the keyboard (behind the band) to guide the band. Before the 1970s, his keyboard playing was generally sparse on recordings but after the 1970s he took a more active role in the rhythm section of the band.

&quot;Where Flamingos Fly&quot; (recorded 1971, released 1981) demonstrated his ability to contract the most accomplished musicians, with veterans Coles, Harry Lookofsky, Richard Davis and Jimmy Knepper (who played the solo on the &quot;Where Flamingos Fly&quot; track on 1961&#x27;s &quot;Out of the Cool&quot;) alongside young multi-instrumentalist Howard Johnson, synthesizer player Don Preston (at that time still a member of The Mothers of Invention), and Billy Harper.

In April 1983, the Gil Evans Orchestra was booked into the Sweet Basil Jazz Club (Greenwich Village, New York) by jazz producer and Sweet Basil owner Horst Liepolt. This turned out to be a regular Monday night engagement for Evans for nearly five years and also resulted in the release of a number of successful albums by &quot;Gil Evans and the Monday Night Orchestra&quot;. Evans&#x27;s ensemble featured many of the top-call musicians in New York, many of whom were also in the NBC Saturday Night Live Band and there were many conflicts, so their &quot;deputies&quot; for the night might be other world-class musicians. Yet Evans was also known to let newcomers &quot;sit in&quot; occasionally. The band also performed arrangements by band members, current and past. Stalwarts in this ensemble were Lew Soloff, Alan Rubin, Marvin Peterson, Tom &quot;Bones&quot; Malone, George Adams, David Sanborn, Pete Levin, Hiram Bullock, Mark Egan, drummer Kenwood Dennard, saxophonist Bill Evans (no relation), and Gil Goldstein. 

In 1987, Evans recorded a live album with Sting: &quot;Last Session – Live At Perugia Jazz Festival July 11, 1987&quot;, featuring the Monday Night Orchestra musicians, guest star Branford Marsalis and big band arrangements of songs by and with The Police and Jimi Hendrix. In the same spirit of introducing new talent in his bands, he collaborated with Maria Schneider with her as an apprentice arranger on this and other final projects. His final project was Nov. 3 &amp; 26, 1987, his arrangements for the Laurent Cugny Big Band in Paris, on the recording &quot;Golden Hair&quot; on Emarcy/Polygram.

In 1996, Columbia Record released a box set which besides the masterpieces, featured outtakes and rarities of Miles Davis and Gil Evans.

===Ryan Truesdell presents the Gil Evans Project===
Ryan Truesdell (de) began the Gil Evans Project, which resulted in a 2012 CD entitled &quot;Centennial&quot;, featuring previously unrecorded compositions and arrangements. These were produced with the permission of the Gil Evans estate, who gave Truesdell access to these scores and materials. Miles Evans, Gil&#x27;s son, also led the Gil Evans Orchestra for a centennial concert at New York&#x27;s Highline Ballroom, featuring many of the musicians heard in the orchestra during Evans&#x27;s lifetime.

==Film music==
In 1986, Evans produced and arranged the soundtrack to the film of the Colin MacInnes book &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;, thereby working with such contemporary artists as Sade Adu, Patsy Kensit&#x27;s Eighth Wonder, the Style Council, Jerry Dammers, Smiley Culture, Edward Tudor-Pole, and David Bowie.

He also arranged the music for the 1986 Martin Scorsese film &quot;The Color of Money&quot;.

==Personal life==
Evans first married Lillian Grace following the 1949 &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; recording sessions. Very little is known about this marriage. In 1963, he married again. Evans was survived by his second wife, Anita (Cooper), and two children, Noah and Miles. His son Miles played trumpet in his &quot;Monday Night Orchestra&quot;.

Evans died of peritonitis in Cuernavaca, Mexico, contracting it shortly after a surgery for his prostate and subsequent travel to Mexico to recover. Evans died at the age of 75.

<text>The West Coast Express is a commuter railway serving the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada. It is owned and operated by the region&#x27;s transit authority, TransLink. Opened in 1995, it provides a link between Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley Regional District and is the only commuter railway in Western Canada. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

Service is provided between Downtown Vancouver and the municipalities of Port Moody, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge, and Mission. Along its route, several stations interchange with the SkyTrain metropolitan rail system as well as local bus services. Additionally, Waterfront station in Downtown Vancouver provides a connection to the SeaBus passenger ferry.

==Operation==

The West Coast Express operates from Monday to Friday (excluding holidays) with five trains per day running from Mission to Vancouver in the morning peak hours (5:25am7:25am) and returning to Mission in the evening peak (3:50pm6:20pm). A one-way trip takes 75 minutes, which is faster than driving to Downtown Vancouver.

The commuter railway is owned by TransLink, the transportation authority of the Metro Vancouver region. Metro Vancouver Transit Police officers and transit security officers conduct random fare inspections within the Fare Paid Zones at stations and on board trains. People caught without valid fare are removed from the train and may be fined $173. Contracted commissionaires provide station attendant services and a security presence, even checking fares on occasion at stations. Commissionaires do not conduct fare enforcement.

===Supplementary bus service===
Rail service is supplemented by TransLink&#x27;s 701 bus route, which runs four eastbound and four westbound trips per weekday—one in the morning, one in the afternoon, and two in the evening—between Coquitlam Central station and Mission City station. As with the West Coast Express itself, this bus service does not run on weekends and holidays. TransLink&#x27;s regular one-zone adult/concession fare rates apply to these trips. The eastbound bus makes regular stops until it reaches Haney Place Exchange in Maple Ridge and then runs non-stop for about 26 minutes to Mission City station. This process is reversed for westbound buses. The entire one-way route is completed in 60 to 70 minutes.

===Prior services===

Until December 30, 2016, the West Coast Express ran coach-style &quot;TrainBus&quot; service, which provided additional service when trains were not running. The TrainBus service provided two buses, one from Port Haney station in Maple Ridge and one from Mission City station, to Vancouver in the morning (after all westbound trains had departed) and five buses eastbound (two mid-day, and three after all eastbound trains had departed Waterfront), three of which extended to Mission, stopping only at West Coast Express stations. This service was replaced by the 701 bus service.

==Fares==
Use of the Compass Card on the West Coast Express began on June 8, 2015, along with new card vending machines. Existing paper fares were honoured until July 24, 2015.

West Coast Express fares can also be used as a three-zone fare on other TransLink services. A one-way fare expires 120 minutes from the time of purchase; all other fares work as an all-day pass. See TransLink Fares for more information on the pricing of the West Coast Express&#x27; fares.

, the lowest adult fare is $5.90 for one or two zones traveled excluding Waterfront station and $7.65 for three zones including Waterfront station. A discount is available for Compass Card users, who are also able to load return and monthly passes.

==Rolling stock==

 Denotes wheelchair access

Each train consists of a General Motors/ EMD F59PHI diesel-electric locomotive and between four and ten Bombardier BiLevel passenger coaches. The West Coast Express also operates an MPI MP36PH-3C and EMD F59PH for backup. The total fleet of passenger coaches numbers 44. Each passenger carriage has a seating capacity of 144 people. Like many commuter railways, the West Coast Express uses push–pull operation; instead of moving the locomotive to the other end of the train, it is controlled remotely from a second cab in the last passenger carriage, allowing the train to run &#x27;backwards&#x27;; this occurs during mornings, as during afternoons the locomotive is at the front of train. Passenger amenities include washrooms, power outlets, wheelchair accessibility and space for bicycles.

The coaches and locomotives are maintained by Via Rail and, under the contract, operated by Alstom Transport Canada (formerly Bombardier Transportation) over tracks which belong to the Canadian Pacific Railway. Bombardier began a contract to operate the trains for the next five years, commencing on May 5, 2014. After May 2014, track time is negotiated between TransLink and the Canadian Pacific Railway, which balances the use by the West Coast Express with its mainstay freight operation.

==Future plans==
TransLink&#x27;s 2009 capital plan included upgrades to the Waterfront and Mission stations, and platform extensions to handle longer trains. In the 2009 10-Year Plan, TransLink also proposed a number of other improvements to West Coast Express service, some of the key improvements being:
* Upgrades to Port Haney station passenger drop-off
* Park and ride expansion at Maple Meadows station

The company committed to maintaining the 2011 service levels to 2014. TransLink has been criticized for the low ridership of the West Coast Express and supports its expansion.

A 20-year service agreement between TransLink and the Canadian Pacific Railroad to operate the West Coast Express expired in 2015. Negotiations for renewal were initiated within the time period covered by this Base Plan. A fuller understanding of the future interaction of the service with the Evergreen Line is required, as well as an understanding of the overall market for long distance travel in the corridor. Accordingly, TransLink initiated the development of a West Coast Express Strategy in 2011 to consult with stakeholders and examine the issues. Completion of the strategy is expected in 2012, with subsequent implementation work expected to identify appropriate future service and infrastructure requirements.

A proposal in the 2009 10-Year Plan for a new station in Albion did not appear in the 2012 ten-year plan. Plans for a new station in northern Burnaby to service Simon Fraser University have been indefinitely postponed.

In 2021, the federal and provincial governments announced an upgrade program to extend the life of six of the seven locomotives used for the West Coast Express, with additional upgrades to improve efficiency and allow the future operation of longer trains. The upgrades are expected to be completed by 2026.

<text>The Hallertau or Holledau is an area in Bavaria, Germany. With an area of 178 km2, it is listed as the largest continuous hop-planting area in the world. According to the International Hop Growing Convention, Germany produces roughly one third of the world&#x27;s hops (used as flavoring and stabilizers during beer brewing), over 80% of which are grown in the Hallertau.

Hallertau is roughly located between the cities of Ingolstadt, Kelheim, Landshut, Moosburg, Freising and Schrobenhausen. The region is defined by the hop-planting area in Bavaria.
It is divided into several seal districts:

* Abensberg
* Altmannstein
* Au in der Hallertau
* Geisenfeld
* Hohenwart
* Langquaid
* Mainburg
* Nandlstadt
* Neustadt an der Donau
* Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm
* Pfeffenhausen
* Rottenburg an der Laaber
* Siegenburg
* Wolnzach

== Famous citizens ==
* Johannes Aventinus (4 July 1477 – 9 January 1534), a Bavarian Renaissance humanist, historian, and philologist.
* Christoph Thomas Scheffler (December 20, 1699 – January 25, 1756), a Bavarian painter of the rococo period.
* Roider Jackl (17 June 1906 – 8 May 1975) was a Bavarian performer, singer, and folk singer

<doc id="374748" wikidata="Q4111566" url="?curid=374748" title="The Offenders (1921 film)">
<text>The Offenders is a 1921 American melodrama film directed by Fenwicke L. Holmes. Margery Wilson, the co-star, reportedly co-directed this and two other films between 1921 and 1924.

The film is frequently mis-dated, either as being released in 1922 or 1924. Contemporary documentation states that it was made in the summer of 1921 and released that November. It was filmed in the town of Randolph, Vermont, with various locals acting as extras. Little else is known about the film, which is suspected to be lost.

What is known is limited to the archives kept in the Chandler Theatre in Randolph (which showed the movie) and the newspaper records of the day. At that time, the newspaper in Randolph was &quot;The Herald and Times&quot;, which is now just &quot;The Herald&quot;.

==Plot==
A girl is held at mercy of gang of crooks, her only friend being a &quot;half-wit&quot;. A murder is committed and blame shifted to the girl.

The &quot;half-wit&quot; has seen the murder, but cannot remember. When he is cured, his testimony frees the girl.

<text>Scott Cardelle Bone (February 15, 1860January 26, 1936) was the fourth Territorial Governor of Alaska, serving from 1921 to 1925. A Republican, he was appointed by President Warren G. Harding. He is perhaps best known for making the decision to use dog sleds to transport diphtheria antitoxin 674 miles rather than use a plane in the now-famous 1925 Serum Run, (also known as the &quot;Great Race of Mercy&quot;) from which the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race stems.

Bone was born in Shelby County, Indiana. He led a very productive life, belonged to numerous organizations and held almost as many positions, such as: chairman of the Alaska Bureau of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, delegate-at-large to the Republican National Convention, member (and at one time president of) the Gridiron Club, member of the National Press Association, director of publicity for the Republican National Committee, life member of the Red Cross, the Yacht and Country Club of Tampa, Florida, and the Decorated Order of Sacred Treasure of Japan, and a member of the Elks.

He was the editor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, founded &quot;The Washington Herald&quot; and later was the editor of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;. He was a friend of Pres. Warren G. Harding, Pres. William Howard Taft, Pres. Theodore Roosevelt, and Alice Roosevelt.

He hosted President Harding and his entourage while they visited Alaska in July 1923.

<doc id="374764" wikidata="Q2077423" url="?curid=374764" title="Economy of Quebec">
<text>The economy of Quebec is diversified and post-industrial with an average potential for growth. It is highly integrated with the economies of the rest of Canada and the United States. Manufacturing and service sectors dominate the economy.

The economic heart of Quebec is the Montreal metropolitan area where half of Quebecers live. This region alone accounts for 53.4% of the province&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP), followed by the Quebec City metropolitan area (11.4%), Gatineau (3.2%), Sherbrooke (2.2%), Saguenay (1.9%) and Trois-Rivières (1.8%). In total, Quebec&#x27;s GDP at market prices was CAD 381 billion or 19% of Canada&#x27;s GDP.

For 2022-23, Quebec&#x27;s budget was C$22 billion. This budget planned to provide $8,9 billion more to the healthcare sector over 5 years. Like most industrialized countries, the economy of Quebec is based mainly on the services sector. Quebec&#x27;s economy has traditionally been fuelled by abundant natural resources, well-developed infrastructure, and average productivity. The provincial GDP in 2021 was C$504,5 billion, making Quebec the second largest economy in Canada after Ontario.

The provincial debt-to-GDP ratio peaked at 50.7% in fiscal year 2012–2013, is now resting at 38.1 in 2022, and is projected to decline to 34% in 2023–2024. The credit rating of Quebec is currently Aa2 according to the Moody&#x27;s agency. In June 2017, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s (S&amp;P) rated Quebec as an AA− credit risk, surpassing Ontario for the first time.

Quebec&#x27;s economy has undergone tremendous changes. Firmly grounded in the knowledge economy, Quebec has one of the highest growth rate of GDP in Canada. The knowledge sector represents about 31% of Quebec&#x27;s GDP. In 2011, Quebec experienced faster growth of its research-and-development (R&amp;D) spending than other Canadian provinces. Quebec&#x27;s spending in R&amp;D in 2021 was equal to C$4.1B or, above the European Union average of 1.8%. The percentage spent on research and technology is the highest in Canada and higher than the averages for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and G7 countries. Approximately 1.1 million Quebecers work in the field of science and technology.

==Economic policies==

===Environmental and energy policy===

Since 2006, Quebec has a green plan in order to achieve the objective of the Kyoto protocol on climate change. The &quot;Ministère du Développement durable, de l&#x27;Environnement et des Parcs du Québec&quot; (Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks) is primarily responsible for implementing environmental policy. For its part, the Société des établissements de plein air du Québec (SEPAQ) is the lead agency for the management of national parks and wildlife reserves. Quebec currently protects nearly 8.12% (135,326 km2) of its territory. The first protected area was the creation of Mt. Royal Park in 1876 followed by the Mont-Tremblant National Park in 1894.

The Quebec government has been working to introduce the electric car since 1994, including contributing financing for technologies such as the TM4 MФTIVE, an electric motor designed and manufactured in Quebec. Hydro-Québec has recently tested more than 50 i-MiEV in order to gradually introduce the charging stations across the province. This is the largest pilot test of electric cars in Canada. Quebec was the first province in Canada to allow the ZENN car to drive on the roads. During the inaugural speech of 2011, Jean Charest announced five priorities for the next 30 years including the Plan Nord and called for a revolution in electric cars.

On November 23, 2009, Premier Jean Charest announced targets for reducing greenhouse gases during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. Quebec will cut its emissions by 20% by the year 2020 compared to international reference of 1990. On January 14, 2010, a new law came into force to reduce greenhouse gases from automobiles which represent 40% of Quebec GHGs. This new law stipulates that car manufacturers serving the territory of Quebec must meet an emission ceiling of 187 grams of GHG/km or approximatively 7.7 L/100 km. This level must be reduced annually up to 127 grams of GHG/km or approximatively 5.3 L/100 km in 2016. These standards are as stringent as those in California (United States), according to the Government of Quebec. The provincial government plans to offer up to $8,000 rebate towards the purchase of an electric car. The government hopes that by 2020, a quarter of cars purchased in Quebec will be electric. The plan would position Quebec as a world leader in electrified transportation according to Jean Charest.
Quebec became the first region in North America to set a carbon tax. Since 2007, consumers pay a special tax on gasoline. Since July 2011, Quebec has imposed a carbon tax that affect more than 85% of industries in the province. This tax will be mandatory from 2013. The sectors affected by this carbon tax will have to reduce their carbon dioxide below 25 000 kilotonnes per year. Only the forest industry, agriculture and waste industries are not affected by this tax. In addition, the Quebec government plans to recover 60% of putrescible organic matter by 2015 in order to reduce its emissions. Quebec climate policy has been harshly criticised by the federal government under Prime minister Stephen Harper. In 2010, former minister Jim Prentice has openly criticized Quebec&#x27;s plan to set GHG standards for motor vehicles sold in the province, describing it as &quot;lunatic&quot;. However, ten months later, Prentice successor, John Baird, has praised Quebec as a world leader in GHG abatement.

=== Electric vehicles ===
Quebec is a leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) in Canada and beyond. According to the latest data from Statistics Canada, Quebec had the highest number of EV registrations in the first quarter of 2022, with 7,522 vehicles. This accounted for 9.2% of the total new vehicle registrations in the province. Quebec was followed by Ontario, with 5,688 EV registrations (4.2% of total) and British Columbia, with 5,385 EV registrations (12.5% of total). The latter number includes the territories.

Quebec also led the country in EV market share for the whole year of 2022, with 36.7% of new vehicle registrations being electric. Ontario was second, with 31.5%, and B.C. was third, with 23.9%. These three provinces accounted for over 90% of the total EV registrations in Canada in 2022. Quebec&#x27;s high EV market share can be attributed to several factors, such as its abundant hydroelectricity, its rich mineral resources, its strong government support, and its competitive fuel economy and cost.

The province has set ambitious targets to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, put 1.5 million EVs on the road in Quebec by 2030, and electrify 55% of city buses and 65% of school buses by 20301. To support these goals, the Quebec government has announced various measures in the recent budget for 2022–2023.

One of these measures is a reduction in rebates available for the purchase of EVs, from $8,000 to $6,000 for new vehicles and from $4,000 to $3,000 for used vehicles. This decision reflects the growing demand and affordability of EVs in the province, as well as the need to ensure the sustainability of the program. However, the government has also allocated new funds for EV charging infrastructure and building out the province&#x27;s EV battery supply chain.

Federal Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson announced nearly $30 million in funding for the installation of more than 1,500 new electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Quebec. The Quebec government announced that they are adding more than 116,000 additional charging stations to the province by investing more than $514 million over the next five years (2023-2028). This will increase the accessibility and convenience of EV charging for drivers and reduce range anxiety across the province.

=== Battery supply chain ===

Quebec is on track to become a major player in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, thanks to its ambitious strategy to develop a domestic battery supply chain. The province has several advantages, such as abundant hydroelectricity, rich mineral resources, and strong government support, that make it an attractive destination for EV battery manufacturing and related activities.

The Quebec government has been actively promoting the adoption of EVs in the province and has allocated new funds for EV charging infrastructure and battery supply chain development. Investissement Québec, the province&#x27;s investment arm, acts as a venture capitalist and provides substantial backing for critical mineral projects, giving a vote of confidence and enticing private capital. The province&#x27;s battery sector development strategy, the Stratégie québécoise de développement de la filière batterie, aims to develop a comprehensive battery supply chain in Quebec by acting as a catalyst for the sector&#x27;s value chain.

Quebec has also attracted several major investments from global players in the battery industry. For instance, Northvolt has confirmed its joining Canada&#x27;s EV battery manufacturing ecosystem with a 170-hectare, $7-billion, 60 GWh-capacity site, enough to power roughly one million EVs a year, that will provide 3,000 jobs in the McMasterville and Saint-Basile-le-Grand area. Ford Motor Co and Korean companies EcoProBM and SK On have announced that they will build a C$1.2 billion ($887 million) plant to produce EV battery materials in Becancour. BASF has announced that it plans to build a factory in Quebec to produce cathode active materials with production expected to start by 2025. Finally, the governments of Quebec and Canada are working closely with Volta Energy Solutions Canada Inc. (VESC) on the establishment of a new copper foil facility in Granby. Copper foils are a core, high-value component in EV batteries, and this new installation will yet again reinforce Canada and Quebec&#x27;s position as a key destination for the future of EV manufacturing.

These initiatives will help Quebec achieve its goal of developing its own complete domestic battery ecosystem and supporting clean technologies. Quebec is poised to become a leader in the EV industry and contribute to the global transition towards a low-carbon economy.

==Most productive sectors==

===Aerospace===
Québec is one of the world&#x27;s top three aerospace capitals, along with Seattle and Toulouse. It has major contractors, leading technical centres and world-class equipment manufacturers in this sector. Québec&#x27;s aerospace industry employs over 36,000 people, mostly in the Montréal area, which is home to one of the world&#x27;s largest aerospace clusters. It also has a strong presence in other regions, such as Québec City, Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, Estrie and Mauricie. Québec&#x27;s aerospace industry is recognized for its innovative drive and creativity. It invests over $700 million in R&amp;D annually, which represents 70% of Canada&#x27;s aerospace R&amp;D spending. It has close ties with universities, technical colleges and research centres that train and support the next generation of aerospace professionals. Montreal boasts a wide array of airlines, manufacturers, and international organizations. It hosts the headquarters of Air Canada (the flagship airline of Canada) and Bombardier (the world&#x27;s third largest aircraft manufacturer). Additionally, jet engine companies Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce Canada, defence contractor Lockheed Martin and L-3 Communications, flight simulator builder CAE, helicopter manufacturer Bell Helicopter and SITA have a significant presence in and around the city. Since Montreal is located in the heart of a vast free trade zone governed by the former North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), now called the USMCA, it gives companies access to a market of about 500 million consumers worldwide. Various international organisations have established their headquarters in Quebec, notably the International Air Transport Association and the International Civil Aviation Organization.

=== Video games ===
Quebec is home to over 280 studios, making it one of the top five game development hubs in the world. Canada has around 937 active studios, meaning Quebec accounts for over one-quarter of the country&#x27;s total game dev workforce. On top of that, the study notes that 86 percent of the studios are Quebec-owned. This means that for all of the big-name international companies that have locations in Quebec, including Ubisoft (Assassin&#x27;s Creed)&quot;,&quot; Warner Bros. (&quot;Gotham Knights&quot;) and EA (&quot;Dead Space&quot;), there are many more that are independent or locally owned, including Behaviour, Sabotage (&quot;Sea of Stars&quot;), Red Barrels (&quot;Outlast&quot;) and Manavoid (&quot;Rainbow Billy&quot;). Besides lucrative tax credits to encourage game development in the province, the study notes that the province&#x27;s links to both the United States and Europe, as well as high standards of living and multiculturalism, help make it a natural location for expansion. For example, Ubisoft Montreal, one of the oldest and biggest game development studios in the world, opened in the province in 1997 as an expansion to Ubisoft&#x27;s early France-based operations. Behaviour was another early key player in the Quebec gaming industry in the &#x27;90s.

=== Artificial Intelligence ===
Quebec is a province that has embraced artificial intelligence as a key driver of innovation and economic growth. Its financial capital city, Montreal, is home to a thriving AI ecosystem that includes the world&#x27;s largest concentration of academic researchers in deep learning at Mila, the Quebec artificial intelligence institute. Led by renowned experts such as Yoshua Bengio, Joelle Pineau, Hugo Larochelle, and Irina Rish, Mila collaborates with industry partners and government agencies to advance AI research and applications for the common good and ethics. Montreal is also a global hub for artificial intelligence research with many companies involved in this sector, such as Facebook AI Research (FAIR), Microsoft Research, Google Brain, DeepMind, Samsung Research and Thales Group (cortAIx). The city also hosts Scale AI, Canada&#x27;s AI global innovation cluster that funds and supports AI projects for supply chains, and IVADO, a unique institute that connects researchers and businesses to develop AI solutions. Quebec&#x27;s AI industry has attracted major investments from the Canadian government, such as the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, and from global companies, such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. Quebec&#x27;s AI industry benefits from a strong foundation in academic excellence. Several world-renowned universities, including the Université de Montréal and McGill University, have established themselves as leading centers for AI research. These institutions have been instrumental in nurturing top AI talent, which has played a crucial role in the industry&#x27;s growth.

=== Engineering ===
The engineering industry in Quebec is one of the most important and influential sectors in the province&#x27;s economy and society. It has a long and rich history that dates back to the colonial era, when engineers played a key role in building and developing the infrastructure and public works of the region. Since then, the engineering industry in Quebec has evolved and diversified, offering a wide range of services and expertise in various fields such as transportation, energy, environment, construction, and manufacturing.

Quebec is home to many engineering firms that operate locally and internationally, providing consulting, design, project management, and construction services to clients from different sectors and regions. Some of the largest and most prominent engineering firms in Quebec are WSP Global and AtkinsRéalis (formerly SNC- Lavalin), both headquartered in Montreal. These two firms have been involved in some of the most iconic and complex projects in the world, such as the Samuel De Champlain Bridge, the Réseau express métropolitain, the Line at NEOM, the Marina Bay Sands, Shanghai Tower, One World Trade Center and the Taiwan High Speed Rail line.

Quebec&#x27;s engineering industry stands as a robust sector, actively contributing to the development and innovation across various fields. Its role in the province&#x27;s and the country&#x27;s economic and social progress is significant. Continuously adapting to societal and environmental changes, this industry consistently seeks new opportunities and addresses challenges. With a proud history and a focus on achievements, it maintains an optimistic and forward-looking approach, envisioning a promising future.

===Finance===
The Finance, insurance, real estate and leasing industry employs 218,000 people, including the largest money manager in Canada, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec. The Bank of Montreal, founded in 1817 in Montreal, was Quebec&#x27;s first bank but, like many other large banks, its central branch is now in Toronto. Several banks remain under Quebecois control, including the National Bank of Canada, the Desjardins Group and the Laurentian Bank.

===Transportation===
Quebec&#x27;s ground transportation industry generated $7.2 billion in revenue at the beginning of 2004. It employs some 35,000 people and includes major original equipment manufacturers such as Bombardier, Paccar, Nova Bus, Prévost CAR, Komatsu International, and many suppliers and sub-contractors.

Quebec has eight deepwater ports for merchandise shipping, and in 2003 9.7 million tons of merchandise was carried by 3,886 cargo ships through the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The income created by this traffic is over $90 million per annum.

The Port of Montreal is the second biggest container handling port in Canada. Located on one of the largest navigable rivers in the world, the Saint Lawrence River, it is the third largest port in northeastern North America. Annual revenues of about $2 billion are created, along with 17,600 direct and indirect jobs.

Besides Montreal, other deepwater ports are located in Trois-Rivières and Bécancour, as well as in Sorel-Tracy, Baie-Comeau, Port-Cartier and Sept-Îles. The last four ports specialise in handling bulk cargo and heavy merchandise.

===Information technology===

Quebec&#x27;s information technology employed over 100,000 workers in 2008. Of the total Canadian venture capital funding 52% is managed in Quebec with 61% of available funds invested in technology. Sectors of note include telecommunications, multimedia software, computer services and consulting, microelectronics and components. Its largest city,

Some 10,000 people work for 115 telecommunication companies such as Bell Canada, Ericsson, Motorola, and Mitec.

The multimedia sector was enhanced by Electronic Arts in 2003. Some 11,000 people work for game development companies such as Ubisoft, Microïds, Strategy First, A2M, and Eidos Interactive.

Montreal has two major creators of 3D animation software: Softimage and Autodesk Media and Entertainment Division.

The computer services, software development, and consulting branch employs 60,000 specialized workers.

The microelectronics sector has 110 companies employing 12,900 people.

===Optics and photonics===
In 2004, some 8000 people were employed in the Quebec optics and photonics industries. Research-related jobs are concentrated chiefly in the seven Quebec City region research centres, while production operations are mostly located in the Greater Montreal area. Quebec counts some 20 businesses in the laser, optical fibre, image processing, and related sectors.

===Biotechnology===
The biotechnology sector in Quebec includes more than 450 companies and organizations. Employing over 25,000 individuals and generating $5.6 billion in annual revenues, it encompasses a diverse array of players, from multinationals to small and medium-sized enterprises, research institutes, universities, and healthcare institutions.

Global players, including Pfizer, Moderna, Novartis, and Merck, have strategically established their roots within Quebec&#x27;s borders. Pfizer stands tall in Quebec with its Canadian headquarters nestled in Kirkland, alongside other offices in Montreal, Mississauga, and Brandon. Pfizer&#x27;s legacy in developing small molecules, vaccines, and biologics extends across diverse therapeutic areas, from oncology to rare diseases and immunology. Moderna, a biotech firm, has chosen Quebec as the site for its first-ever plant outside the United States. Novartis boasts a significant Quebec presence through its divisions, including Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc., with headquarters in Kirkland and a Toronto location. Quebec is also home to Sandoz Canada Inc., a generic drug manufacturing subsidiary with an office in Boucherville. Finally, Merck, a global biopharmaceutical juggernaut, maintains two critical divisions in Canada. Merck Canada Inc., headquartered in Kirkland, reinforces Quebec&#x27;s position in the biotechnology landscape, while Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. in Montreal serves as a pivotal research and development center.

===Health industry===
With 381 companies and 24,550 employees in the pharmaceutical, research and development, manufacturing, and related sectors, the Quebec health industry is one of the most important economic stimuli of modern Quebec. With the presence of some 20 multinationals such as Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, Aventis, Novartis, Valeant, Galderma. GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol-Myers Squibb, Montreal ranks eighth in North America for the number of jobs in the pharmaceutical sector.

===Tourism===
Tourism plays an important role in the economy of Quebec. Tourism represents 2.5% of Quebec&#x27;s GDP and nearly 400,000 people are employed in the tourism sector. Nearly 30,000 businesses are related to this industry, of which 70% are located outside of Montreal and Quebec City. In 2011, Quebec welcomed 26 million foreign tourists, most of them from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Mexico and Japan.

The province of Quebec has 22 tourist regions, each of which presents its geography, its history and culture. The capital, Quebec City, is the only fortified city in North America and has its own European cachet. The oldest Francophone city in North America, Quebec City was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985 and has celebrated its 400th anniversary in 2008. Montreal is the only Francophone metropolis in North America and also the second largest Francophone city after Paris in terms of population. This major centre of 4 million inhabitants is a tapestry of cultures from the world over with its many neighbourhoods, including Chinatown, the Latin Quarter, the Gay Village, Little Italy, Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, the Quartier International and Old Montreal. Montreal has a rich architectural heritage, along with many cultural activities, sports events and festivals.

The province of Quebec has over 400 museums including the Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal, which is the oldest museum in Canada and one of the most important art institutions. It is Montreal&#x27;s largest museum and is amongst the most prominent in Canada.

Quebec is also a religious tourism destination. The Basilique Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré and Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal are the most popular religious site in the province. In 2005, the Oratory was added to the List of National Historic Sites of Canada on the occasion of its 100th anniversary. Quebec has over 130 church and Cathedrals. All of which bear witness to the many origins that colonized the region.

In 2003, tourism-related expenditures amounted to C$7.3 billion. Some 27.5 million trips were made in Quebec, 76% of which were made by Quebecers themselves, 13% by other Canadians, 8% from the United States and 3% from other countries. Almost 330,000 people are employed in the tourism sector, working in over 34,000 businesses. Quebec is listed among the top 20 best tourist destinations in the world, and the City of Quebec is the only fortified city in North America north of Mexico.

The most visited cities are Montreal and Quebec City, although a sizeable number also visit the city of Gatineau in the west, which forms part of the federal National Capital Region (Ottawa).

===Energy===
Unlike most other regions of the world, Quebec stands out for its use of renewable energy. In 2008, electricity (more than 99% of which came from renewable energy sources) ranked as the main form of energy used in Quebec (41.6%), followed by oil (38.2%) and natural gas (10.7%).

Quebec produces most of Canada&#x27;s hydroelectricity and is the 2nd biggest hydroelectricity producer in the world (2019) Because of this, Quebec has been described as a potential clean energy superpower. In 2019, Quebec&#x27;s electricity production amounted to 214 terawatt-hours (TWh), 95% of which comes from hydroelectric power stations, and 4.7% of which come from wind energy. Thermal electricity production is almost completely absent from Quebec, except for a few power stations exploiting forest biomass or diesel generators which supply some twenty remote communities.

The public company Hydro-Québec occupies a dominant position in the production, transmission and distribution of electricity in Quebec. Hydro-Québec operates 63 hydroelectric power stations and 28 large reservoirs; they guarantee a stable and flexible supply which adjusts according to demand. Because of the remoteness of Hydro-Québec&#x27;s TransÉnergie division, with its main facilities located in James Bay and on the Côte-Nord, the TransÉnergie division operates the largest electricity transmission network in North America. Their network includes 34,361 km of lines and 17 interconnections with neighbouring markets, allowing for the export of 38.3 TWh in 2018 alone.

As Quebec has few significant deposits of fossil fuels, all hydrocarbons are imported. Refiners&#x27; sourcing strategies have varied over time and have depended on market conditions. In the 1990s, Quebec purchased much of its oil from the North Sea. Since 2015, it now consumes almost exclusively the crude produced in western Canada and the United States. Quebec&#x27;s two active refineries (Valero&#x27;s in Lévis, and Suncor&#x27;s in Montreal) have a total capacity of 402,000 barrels per day, which is greater than local needs, which stood at 365,000 barrels per day in 2018. In 2021, an Ipsos poll found that 43% of Quebecers want their province to develop its own oil resources instead of continuing to import all the oil consumed in the province.

The natural gas consumed in Quebec arrives through the TC Energy transmission network. Since 2016, Quebec&#x27;s main natural gas distributor, the Énergir company, has been getting its supply at the Dawn reception point in southwestern Ontario, instead of at its previous main source the Empress intersection in Alberta. This change has occurred because of an increase in the non-traditional production of shale gas in North America, stimulating competition between the different supply basins operated across the continent. In 2018, 86% of natural gas came from Dawn and 12% from Empress. The rest consists of injections of natural gas produced locally by the recovery of residual materials.

===Agriculture===

The combination of rich and easily arable soils and relatively warm climate make the St. Lawrence River Valley Quebec&#x27;s most prolific agricultural area. Throughout the province, there are 29,380 farm enterprises and 42,265 farmers. It produces meat, dairy products, fruit, vegetables, foie gras, (of which Quebec is the world&#x27;s largest producer), fish, and livestock. In Quebec, agricultural land accounts for only 2% of the province&#x27;s total land area. In France, the figure is 58%, whereas in the United States, it is 45%.

 face many pests and diseases. Among caterpillars the Bruce spanworm, Forest tent caterpillar, and Gypsy moth are most severe. Among fungal diseases the greatest impact is due to Eutypella canker (&quot;E. parasitica&quot;) and Nectria canker (&quot;N. galligena&quot;), and Armillaria ostoyae root disease, Hardwood Trunk Rot, and Tar spot are also significant.

The agri-food industry plays an important role in the economy of Quebec, with meat and dairy products being the two main sectors. It accounts for 8% of the Quebec&#x27;s GDP and generates $19.2 billion. This industry generated 487,000 jobs in agriculture, fisheries, manufacturing of food, beverages and tobacco and food distribution. Quebec is in 1st place for the highest amount of milk produced and biggest amount of farms engaged in the dairy industry (2019). Animal production accounts for more than half of all farms in Quebec. Dairy production is the province&#x27;s most important, accounting for 57% of farm enterprises and 26% of income. It is followed by hog production, which accounts for 15% of total revenue. The most major agricultural output is grain maize (for livestock).

Quebec&#x27;s exports of food products increased by 75% between 1999 and 2002, reaching $3.6 billion. In 2002, more than 150 countries imported these products, 88% of them with three partners: the United States (75.1%), the European Union (5.5%) and Japan (7.4%). The most exported products are pork, various food preparations, and various agricultural and food products.

Quebec sells its products to the Eastern and Asian markets in such large quantities that China is now the second country (after the United States) that imports the most Quebec products with 4% of Quebec exports.

In Quebec, agricultural activities generated $9.1 billion in product sales revenue. The regions of Montérégie (30%), Chaudière-Appalaches (18%), and Centre-du-Québec (14%), account for 61% of total revenue.

 are grown here, the highest for any province or territory. &quot;APFFdQ&quot; recommends cultivars for the province:
For varieties &quot;APFFdQ&quot; recommends Boyne, Killarney, Festival, Nova, Tulameen, Pathfinder, Polana.

===Forestry===
North of the St. Lawrence River Valley, the territory of Quebec has significant resources in its coniferous forests, lakes, and rivers. These include pulp, paper, and lumber. More than half of Quebec (nearly 900,000 km2) is covered in forests, a size nearly twice that of Sweden.

The pulp and paper industry generates annual shipments valued at more than $14 billion. The forest products industry ranks second in exports, with shipments valued at almost $11 billion. It is also the main, and in some circumstances only, source of manufacturing activity in more than 250 municipalities in the province. The forest industry has slowed in recent years because of the softwood lumber dispute. This industry employs 68,000 people in several regions of Quebec. This industry accounted for 3.1% of Quebec&#x27;s GDP. In 2020, it accounted for 8% of Quebec&#x27;s exports, nearly $12 billion of forest products each year, the second largest amount of any province.

Quebec has renewable forest resources extending over an area of nearly and generating an annual allowable cut of about million. In 2021, a study concluded that only 1% of Quebec&#x27;s forests are harvested each year.

===Mining===
Québec has immense mining potential, and in 2021, it was the second highest mineral-producing province by value at $11.9 billion, coming second to British Columbia ($12.9 billion). The Abitibi also has the world&#x27;s largest Archean volcano-sedimentary belt and is known for its gold, copper, zinc, and silver resources. Québec develops 17 metals and 12 nonmetals, giving it Canada&#x27;s most diverse resource base. Without including corporate income tax, the Québec government received $1.3 billion in 2018, while the Government of Canada received an extra $500 million through mining activities.

Approximately 30 minerals are mined, with the most important being iron, gold, nickel, titanium, niobium, zinc, copper, silver, and stone. In 2010, the province was the largest producer of zinc in Canada and the second largest producer of gold and iron. The province is also the world&#x27;s second-largest producer of niobium and the third of titanium dioxide. The province&#x27;s first diamond mine is scheduled to commence operations in 2016. The province has 27 mines, around 200 exploration firms, and 12 primary processing plants. In 2010 the value of mineral shipments from the province was about $6.8 billion.

==Imports and exports==

Quebec exported C$98 billion in 2021, making it Canada&#x27;s third highest exporter out of 13 exporters. Fixed wing aircraft, unladen weight (C$5.36B), aluminium unwrought, not alloyed (C$4.64B), aluminium unwrought, alloyed (C$4.24B), iron ore, concentrate, not iron pyrites, unagglomerate (C$4.22B), and wood; coniferous species, other than of...

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), grants Quebec, among other things, the access to a market of 130 million consumers within . With the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the NAFTA, Quebec is increasing its ability to compete internationally. Following these agreements, trade relations with other countries were boosted. As a result, Quebec has seen its exports increase significantly.

Exports for the year 2022 were 4.5% higher than in 2021

Approximately 85% of Quebec exports are destined for the United States. Economic relations between Quebec and France are important: in 2008, approximately 17,000 Quebecers are employed in 470 French companies in Quebec, and 26,000 French people work in 154 Quebec companies in France.

Several prominent Quebec companies work within the international market: Cascades and AbitibiBowater pulp and paper producers, Agropur milk producer, Bombardier transport manufacturer, CGI information technologies, Cirque du Soleil circus, Couche-Tard convenience stores, Garda security, Énergir power distributor, Cossette marketing firm, Quebecor media and telecommunications, Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton accounting firm, Saputo dairy and food company, Vachon bakery, SNC-Lavalin engineering and construction group, Molson brewery, and many more.

<text>The Genius and the Goddess (1955) is a novel by Aldous Huxley. It is the fictional account of John Rivers, a student physicist in the 1920s who was hired out of college as a laboratory assistant to Henry Maartens.

==Plot summary==
The story begins in 1951. John Rivers is speaking to a friend about his encounter with the Maartens family. In 1921, Rivers, who was extremely sheltered by his widowed mother, is employed as a lab assistant to Henry Maartens, after receiving his PhD. Dr. Maartens is a Nobel Prize–winning, socially awkward physicist. Rivers is invited to live in Henry&#x27;s home until he finds his own place, but the Maartens family soon develops a fondness for Rivers, and insists that he stay with them. Rivers develops respect and fondness for the family, regarding Henry as a genius and his wife Katy as a goddess. As his attraction towards Katy grows, Rivers is simultaneously victimized by her 15-year-old daughter Ruth. After being rejected by a 17-year-old football player and scholarship winner, Ruth tries to be a dramatic poetess. She fantasizes that she is in love with Rivers to find solace and an outlet for her emotions.

Rivers&#x27; experience with the Maartens family takes an important turn when Katy has to leave for a time to care for her dying mother. The unstable, asthmatic Henry becomes an emotional wreck without his much younger wife to care for him. The children, the household, and Henry himself are cared for only by the housekeeper Beluah and Rivers. Ruth takes advantage of her mother&#x27;s absence to entertain her cosmetic interests and act out her imaginary love for Rivers, who just laughs at Ruth&#x27;s poems.

Katy returns sooner than planned because of Henry&#x27;s declining health. She herself has so much vitality that she cannot minister Henry any longer. Learning of her mother&#x27;s death, Katy turns to Rivers for comfort. Their relationship becomes sexual. Having lost his virginity, Rivers feels guilt for betraying his mother and pious background, and also for betraying his sick master Henry Maartens. As Henry recovers, Katy and Rivers continue their affair secretly. Ruth suspects Rivers of being in love with her mother, and presents him with a poem that subtly describes his affair with her mother. Rivers laughs off the poem, says that it reminds him of his father&#x27;s sermons, and hides his true emotions.

Katy and Rivers agree that he must leave. Rivers prepares to leave, saying that his mother is ill, but Katy and Ruth die in a car accident. Rivers is dejected and only recovers because he meets Helen, his future wife, at a party. Henry lives on and marries Katy&#x27;s sister, who dies due to her obesity. After her death, Henry Maartens has a last and fourth marriage to a young redhead named Alicia. Henry dies at the age of 87. The story ends with Rivers, having Henry&#x27;s biography and the memories of his life at the Maartens&#x27;.

<doc id="374778" wikidata="Q1186710" url="?curid=374778" title="Dollar coin (United States)">
<text>The dollar coin is a United States coin with a face value of one United States dollar. Dollar coins have been minted in the United States in gold, silver, and base metal versions. Dollar coins were first minted in the United States in 1794.

Dollar coins have almost never been popular in circulation since their inception. Despite efforts by the U.S. government to promote their use to save the cost of printing one dollar bills, the Anthony Dollar, the Sacagawea Dollar and the Presidential Dollar Series are all seldom seen in circulation, since most Americans prefer to use the dollar bill. For this reason, since December 11, 2011, the Mint has not produced dollar coins for general circulation, and all dollar coins produced after that date have been specifically for collectors. These collector coins can be ordered directly from the Mint, while pre-2012 circulation dollars can be obtained from most U.S. banks.

== Popularity ==

One-dollar coins, both in silver and base-metal forms, have never been popular in circulation from the 19th century to the present, despite several attempts to increase their usage since the 1970s, for various reasons:
* From 1792 to 1803 the $1 coin compared favorably with the Spanish dollar and was accepted at par for overseas purchases. Its coinage was suspended in 1803 since it did not remain long in domestic circulation.
* During the 1850s California gold rush the silver dollar of was internationally worth more than the gold dollar of and was therefore exported (see Gresham&#x27;s law). Likewise, the gold dollar of 1849–1889 was a tiny coin measuring only in diameter, making it difficult to grasp and easy to lose, a serious problem when one dollar was about a day&#x27;s wage.
* While substantial numbers of silver Morgan dollars were minted from 1878 pursuant to the Bland-Allison Act, there also existed an option to hold silver certificates fully backed by silver dollars kept in reserves. The majority of citizens, therefore, opted to use silver certificates while most silver dollars languished inside treasury and bank vaults.

Succeeding base-metal $1 coins minted from 1971 onwards did not circulate widely as well, the most important reason being the continued circulation of the $1 bill.
* The copper-nickel clad Eisenhower dollar minted from 1971 to 1978 was not popular due to its large size relative to its gradually diminishing value;
* The smaller-sized Susan B. Anthony dollar coin minted from 1979 to 1981 and again in 1999, was highly unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters, due to their nearly equal size, color and reeded edge;
* Sacagawea dollars and Presidential dollar coins have been issued since 2000. These coins have a distinct weight, gold color, and smooth edge. Despite these remedies, golden dollars continue to circulate poorly since the $1 bill continues to be produced.

The non-acceptance of $1 coins in the United States contrasts with the practice in most other developed countries where denominations of similar value exist only in coins; for example, the lowest-value pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen notes are the £5 note, €5 note and 1000 yen note respectively; each is worth more than US$5. These high-value coins (such as the €2 coin, Canadian &quot;toonie&quot; or 5 Swiss francs) have largely succeeded because of the removal (or lack) of their corresponding paper issues, whereas the U.S. government has taken no action to remove the $1 bill. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has stated that discontinuing the dollar bill in favor of the dollar coin would save the U.S. government approximately over thirty years primarily through seigniorage. The Federal Reserve has refused to order the coin from the mint for distribution citing a lack of demand, according to ex-Mint director Philip Diehl in November 2012.

Whatever the reason, a U.S. Mint official claimed in a November 2012 meeting that most of the 2.4 billion dollar coins minted in the previous five years were not in circulation.

In 2019, the GAO re-estimated the cost of replacing the $1 bill and found for the first time that it would cause the government to lose between and because physical money was being used less, resulting in dollar bills remaining in circulation longer compared to the 2011 analysis.

== Mint marks ==
The list below is of all mint marks used on the dollar coin:
*C: Charlotte, North Carolina (gold coins only; 1838–1861).
*CC: Carson City, Nevada (1870–1893).
*D: Dahlonega, Georgia (gold coins only; 1838–1861).
*D: Denver, Colorado (1906 to date).
*O: New Orleans, Louisiana (1838–1861; 1879–1909).
*P: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (produced from 1793 to date, mint mark introduced in 1979).
*S: San Francisco, California (1854 to date).
*W: West Point, New York (1984 to date).

== History ==

=== Early dollar coins ===

Before the American Revolutionary War, coins from many European nations circulated freely in the American colonies, as did coinage issued by the various colonies. Chief among these were the Spanish silver dollar coins (also called pieces of eight or eight reales) minted in Mexico and other colonies with silver mined from North, Central and South American mines. These coins, along with others of similar size and value, were in use throughout the colonies, and later the United States, and were legal tender until 1857.

In 1776, several thousand pewter Continental Currency coins were minted. Although unconfirmed, many numismatists believe these to have been pattern coins of a proposed silver dollar coin authorized by the Continental Congress to prop up the rapidly failing Continental Currency—the first attempt by the fledgling U.S. at paper currency. Several examples were also struck in brass and silver, but a circulating coin was not produced, in large part because of the financial difficulties of running the Revolutionary War. The Continental Currency dollar coin bears the date 1776, and while its true denomination is not known, it is generally the size of later dollars, and the name has stuck. The failure of the Continental Currency exacerbated a distrust of paper money among both politicians and the population at large. The letters of Thomas Jefferson indicate that he wished the United States to eschew paper money and instead mint coins of similar perceived value and worth to those foreign coins circulating at the time.
The Coinage Act of 1792 authorized the production of dollar coins from silver. The United States Mint produced silver dollar coins from 1794 to 1803, then ceased regular production of silver dollars until 1836. The first silver dollars, precisely 1,758 of them, were coined on October 15, 1794, and were immediately delivered to Mint Director David Rittenhouse for distribution to dignitaries as souvenirs. Thereafter, until 1804, they were struck in varying quantities. There are two obverse designs: Flowing Hair (1794–1795) and Draped Bust (1795–1804). There are also two reverse designs used for the Draped Bust variety: small eagle (1795–1798) and heraldic eagle (1798–1804). Original silver dollars from this period are highly prized by coin collectors and are exceptionally valuable, and range from fairly common to incredibly rare. Because of the early practice of hand engraving each die, there are dozens of varieties known for all dates between 1795 and 1803.

It is also one of only two denominations (the other being the cent) minted every year from its inception during the first decade of mint operation. Though a new Spanish dollar or 8-real minted after 1772 theoretically contained 417.7 grains of silver of fineness 130/144 (or 377.1 grains fine silver), reliable assays of the period confirmed a fine silver content of for the average Spanish dollar in circulation. 

The new US silver dollar of therefore compared favorably and was received at par with the Spanish dollar for foreign payments, and in 1803 President Thomas Jefferson halted new silver dollars made out of the US Mint&#x27;s limited resources since it failed to stay in domestic circulation. The less-exportable half dollar therefore became the largest US-made silver coin in domestic use for the next several decades. It was only after Mexican independence in 1821 when their peso&#x27;s fine silver content of 377.1 grains was firmly upheld, which the US later had to compete with using a heavier Trade dollar coin of fine silver.

=== The 1804 dollar ===
The 1804 dollar is one of the rarest and most famous coins in the world. Its creation was the result of a simple bookkeeping error, but its status as a highly prized rarity has been established for nearly a century and a half. The silver dollars reported by the mint as being struck in 1804 were dated 1803. (With die steel being very expensive in the early 19th century, dies were used until they were no longer in working condition. This is why many early U.S. coins exhibit various kinds of die cracks, occlusions, cuds, clash marks, and other late-state die wear. Nearly every coin the U.S. struck from 1793 to 1825 has an example that was struck in a year other than that which it bears.) No dollars bearing the date 1804 were ever struck in 1804, though this was unknown to mint officials at the time the 1804 dollar came to be.

The 1804 silver dollar was actually produced in 1834, when the U.S. Department of State decided to produce a set of U.S. coins to be used as gifts to rulers in Asia in exchange for trade advantages. Since 1804 was the last recorded year of mintage for both the dollar and $10 Eagle, it was decided that the set would contain examples of those coins dated 1804, as well as the other denominations currently being produced. Mint officials, not realizing that the 19,000+ dollars recorded as being produced in 1804 were all dated 1803, proceeded to make new dies bearing the date 1804. Only 15 silver dollars with the date of 1804 are known to exist; in 1999, one of them sold at auction for more than $4 million. There are 8 Class I dollars, struck in 1834 for the aforementioned sets, 1 Class II dollar, struck over an 1857 Swiss Shooting Thaler (and now residing in the U.S. Coin Collection at the Smithsonian Institution), and 6 Class III dollars, struck surreptitiously sometime between 1858 and 1860 to meet collector demand for the coin.

=== Seated Liberty dollar (1836–1873) ===
Seated Liberty dollars were introduced in 1836 and were minted in lesser quantities than the sparsely minted Gobrecht dollar that preceded it. The dollars were used in general circulation until 1873. The production of large numbers of U.S. gold coins (The first $1 and $20 gold coins were minted in 1849) from the new California mines lowered the price of gold, thereby increasing the value of silver. By 1853, the value of a U.S. silver dollar contained in gold terms, $1.04 of silver, equal to $ today. With the Mint Act of 1853, all U.S. silver coins, except for the U.S. silver dollar and new 3-cent coin, were reduced by 6.9% as of weight with arrows on the date to denote reduction. The U.S. silver dollar continued to be minted in very small numbers mainly as a foreign trade coin with the Orient.

The international trading partners did not like the fact that U.S. coins were reduced in weight. The use of much more common half dollars became problematic since merchants would have to separate higher value pre-1853 coins from the newer reduced ones. From 1853 onward, trade with Asia was typically done with Mexican coins that kept their weight and purity in the 19th century. This ended in 1874 when the price of silver dropped so that a silver dollar had less than $1.00 worth of silver in it (because of huge amounts of silver coming from the Nevada Comstock Lode mines). By 1876, all silver coins were being used as money and by 1878, gold was at par with all U.S. paper dollars. Beginning in 1878, huge amounts of the Morgan silver dollars were produced but few were used as money. The size was too large to carry on business so Silver Certificates were used instead. The mint made the coins, placed them in their vaults, and issued the Silver Certificates instead. This is the reason so many Morgan and Peace dollars can be purchased in AU or UNC condition (near perfect) since they sat in bank or U.S. Treasury vaults most of the time.

Each Seated Liberty dollar is composed of 0.77344 troy oz of silver. They were minted at Philadelphia, New Orleans, Carson City, and San Francisco. A silver dollar would be worth $1 in silver if the price of silver is . The current silver price (January 29, 2021) is so a silver dollar is worth, in melt value of about .

=== Gold dollar coins (1849–1889) ===
The gold dollar weighing 1.672 g produced from 1849 to 1889 in 90% gold 10% copper. 1849 to 1853 gold dollar coins were 13 mm across and are called Type I. Type II gold dollars were thinner but larger at 15 mm diameter and were produced from 1854 to 1855. The most common gold dollar is the Type III, struck from 1856 until 1889. Production of US$1 gold dollars was high until the Civil War and by 1863, only the larger value gold coins were produced in large quantities. Most gold coins produced from 1863 and onward were produced for imports to pay for enormous amounts of war material and interest on some U.S. Government bonds. Many of these coins from the Civil War and after (silver coins included) are in excellent condition since they saw very limited circulation with greenbacks and postage currency taking their place.

Composed of 90% pure gold, it was the smallest denomination of gold currency ever produced by the United States federal government. When the U.S. system of coinage was originally designed there had been no plans for a gold dollar coin, but in the late 1840s, two gold rushes later, Congress was looking to expand the use of gold in the country&#x27;s currency. The gold dollar was authorized by the Act of March 3, 1849, and the Liberty Head type began circulating soon afterward. Because of the high value of gold, the gold dollar is the smallest coin in the history of U.S. coinage.

While true gold dollars are no longer minted, the Sacagawea, Presidential, and American Innovation dollars are sometimes referred to as golden dollars because of their color. 

=== Trade dollar (1873–1885) ===
The trade dollar was produced in response to other Western powers, such as Great Britain, Spain, France, and particularly Mexico, to compete with these trade coins for use in trade in Asia. While the previous Spanish dollar of contained less fine silver than the standard dollar coin of , Mexican pesos minted after Mexican independence contained a full of fine silver.
The American trade dollar therefore had to contain more silver, at 420 grains of 90% fine silver, fine content , or 0.44 g more fine silver than the regular circulation Seated Liberty Dollars and Morgan Dollars. Most trade dollars ended up in China during their first two years of production, where they were very successful. Many of them exhibit holes or chopmarks which are counterstamps from Asian merchants to verify the authenticity of the coins. Many trade coins of the western powers and large silver coins from China, Korea, and Japan also bear these chopmarks. While most chopmarked coins are generally worth less than those without, some of the more fascinating chopmarks can give the coin a modest premium.

Trade dollars did not circulate in the United States initially, but were legal tender for up to . Things changed, however, in 1876, when the price of silver spiraled downward as western producers dumped silver on the market, making the trade dollar worth more at face value than its silver content. That resulted in trade dollars pouring back into the United States, as they were bought for as little as the equivalent of 80 US cents in Asia, and were then spent at in the United States. This prompted Congress to revoke their legal tender status, and restrict their coinage to exportation demand only. However, this did not stop unscrupulous persons from buying trade dollars at bullion value, and using them for payment as to unsuspecting workers and merchants.

Production of the trade dollar was officially discontinued for business strikes in 1878, and thereafter from 1879 to 1885, produced only as proof examples of the coin. The issues of 1884 and 1885 were produced surreptitiously and were unknown to the collecting public until 1908.

In February 1887, all non-mutilated, non-chopmarked outstanding trade dollars were made redeemable to the United States Treasury for , and approximately 8 million of them were turned in.

=== Morgan dollar (1878–1904, 1921, 2021-present) ===
Morgan silver dollars, all composed of 90% silver and 10% copper (slightly less silver than sterling silver, 92.5%) containing of pure silver, were struck between 1878 and 1904, with a minting in 1921 and a commemorative minting in 2021. The 1921-dated coins are the most common, and there exists a substantial collector market for pristine, uncirculated specimens of the rarer dates and mint marks. Morgan dollars are second only to Lincoln Cents in collector popularity. The coin is named after George T. Morgan, its designer. Morgan dollars were minted at Philadelphia (no mint mark), New Orleans (&quot;O&quot; mint mark), San Francisco (&quot;S&quot; mint mark), Carson City (&quot;CC&quot; mint mark), and (in 1921 only) Denver (&quot;D&quot; mint mark). The mint mark is found on the reverse below the wreath, above the &quot;O&quot; in &quot;DOLLAR&quot;. Production of the Morgan Dollar began again in 2021 and US Mint officials announced an intention to continue producing them in 2023 and beyond.

=== Peace dollar (1921–1928, 1934–1935, 2021-present) ===
Introduced in December 1921 and having the same ratio of silver-to-copper as the Morgan dollar, the Peace dollar, designed by medalist Anthony de Francisci, was promulgated to commemorate the signing of formal peace treaties between the Allied forces and Germany and Austria. These treaties officially ended the Allies&#x27; World War I hostilities with these two countries. In 1922 the Mint made silver dollar production its top priority, causing other denominations to be produced sparingly if at all that year. Production ceased temporarily after 1928; original plans called for only a one-year suspension, but this was extended by the Great Depression. Mintage resumed in 1934, but for only two years.

In May 1965, 316,000+ Peace dollars were minted, all at the Denver Mint and dated 1964-D; however, plans for completing this coinage were abandoned, and most of those already minted were melted, with two known trial strike specimens being preserved (for assay purposes) until 1970, when they too were melted, and none released either for circulation or collection purposes. It is rumored that one or more pieces still exist, most notably any examples obtained by key members of Congress, the president, or mint officials. However, this coin, much like the 1933 $20 gold double eagle (aside from the &quot;exception&quot;, sold in 2002 for over $7 million and the 10 found later), is illegal to own and would be subject to confiscation.

Minting of the Peace Dollar began again in 2021. US Mint officials have announced an intention to continue minting Peace Dollars in 2023 and beyond.

=== Release of dollars by the U.S. Treasury: the GSA sale ===

Because of the size and weight of the dollar coins, they circulated minimally throughout their history, except in the West (especially at casinos in the early-to-mid-20th century, where they were commonly used both at the tables and at slot machines.) As a result, the coins were generally shipped to Washington and stored in the vaults of the U.S. Treasury; at times these stores numbered into the hundreds of millions.

They were very popular as Christmas gifts, however, and from the 1930s to the early 1960s, many bags were annually released to banks nationwide to be distributed as presents. In November 1962, during this annual distribution, it was discovered that there were some rare and valuable dates, still sealed in their original mint bags, all in uncirculated condition, among the millions of dollar coins still in the Treasury vaults. Collectors/investors/dealers lined up to purchase them in $1,000 bags, trading silver certificates for the coins. Before this event, the great rarity of the Morgan series was 1903-O, which was by far the most expensive of the entire set. It was discovered that there were millions of this specific date and mint in the Treasury vaults; an estimated 84% of the entire mintage sat in these bags, untouched for 60 years, all in uncirculated condition. While still relatively expensive in circulated grades, uncirculated examples can be had for a modest amount over common dates.

On March 25, 1964, Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon announced that Silver Certificates would no longer be redeemable for silver dollars. Subsequently, another act of Congress dated June 24, 1967, provided that Silver Certificates could be exchanged for silver bullion for a period of one year, until June 24, 1968.

Following this, the Treasury inventoried its remaining stock of dollar coins and found approximately 3,000 bags containing 3 million coins. Many of the remaining coins were Carson City mint dollars, which even then carried a premium. The coins were placed in special hard plastic holders and the General Services Administration (GSA) was given authorization to sell them to the public in a series of mail-bid sales. Five sales were conducted in 1973 and 1974, but sales were poor, and the results unspectacular. There was much complaining among the coin-buying public, many stating that the United States government should not be in the &quot;coin business&quot;, especially considering that the government had spent little more than a dollar to mint and store each coin. After these sales, more than a million coins were still left unsold.

These sat again until 1979–1980, where, amidst an extraordinarily volatile precious metals market (the attempt by the 3 Hunt brothers to corner the silver market), the remaining coins were sold under chaotic conditions. The GSA, having published minimum bids in November 1979, announced on January 2, 1980, that those minimum bids were no longer valid, and that prospective bidders would have to &quot;call in&quot; to a toll-free number to get current minimum bids. Then, on February 21, 13 days after the bidding process officially began, the maximum number of coins per bidder was changed from 500 to 35. Many bidders, under these confusing conditions, ended up with no coins at all. Complaints again flooded into Congress, but the damage had already been done, and the last silver dollars held by the United States Treasury were gone.

Over the years, many of these GSA dollars have been broken out of their special holders for purposes of grading or otherwise, and now GSA dollars still in the unbroken original holders carry a small premium. Some third-party grading companies have begun to grade coins still in their GSA holders, as a means of preservation, though this is not without controversy.

=== Eisenhower dollar (1971–1978) ===

From 1971 to 1978, the U.S. Mint issued dollar coins with the obverse depicting President Dwight David Eisenhower and the reverse the insignia of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, both designed by Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro. The 1976 Bicentennial commemorative design, produced in 1975 and 1976, featured the Liberty Bell and the Moon on the reverse (designed by Dennis R. Williams) while retaining the Eisenhower obverse, and the dual dates 1776–1976. The Eisenhower dollars minted for general circulation contained no silver or gold but were instead composed of the same copper-nickel clad composition used for the dime, quarter, and half dollar. This made the circulation coins extremely resistant to wear and, like the smaller denominations, they still retain a good deal of shine even when subject to mass usage.

From 1971 through 1976, the Mint also produced dollars composed of 40% silver aimed at the collector market. The 1971–1974 issues appeared in brown boxes or blue packages, depending on whether they were proof or uncirculated. Somewhat different Bicentennial sets were produced in the following two years. All issues remain very common.

The coins were never very popular, primarily because of their large size and weight which made them inconvenient to carry, and the fact that very few vending machines were designed to accept them. They saw the greatest use in casinos, and one-dollar tokens in many United States casinos still approximate the size and weight of the coins. Prior to the withdrawal of the coins, which remain legal tender (and are sometimes available at banks by request), many casinos did not strike their own tokens, but instead used the Eisenhower dollar.

=== Susan B. Anthony dollar (1979–1981; 1999) ===


From 1979 to 1981, and again in 1999, the Mint produced Anthony Dollars depicting women&#x27;s suffrage activist Susan B. Anthony (also designed by Frank Gasparro). Anthony thus became the first historical female person portrayed on circulating U.S. coinage. Many earlier circulating coins had featured images of women via allegorical figures such as Peace or Liberty; Spain&#x27;s Queen Isabella appeared on the 1893 Columbian Exposition quarter dollar but the coin was not intended for general circulation. The Anthony dollars, like the Eisenhower dollars, were made from a copper-nickel clad copper core. The 1981 coins were issued for collectors only but occasionally show up in circulation.

The Anthony dollar, because of its color, size, and design, was often confused with the quarter. It was never popular and production was suspended after 1981. In 1999, it was struck again when Treasury reserves of the coin were low and the Sacagawea dollar was still a year away from production. While reserves of the coins were high, the coins were most often seen in vending machines, transit systems, and post offices.

=== American Silver Eagle (1986–present) ===
The American Silver Eagle is the official silver bullion coin of the United States. It was designed by Adolph A. Weinman and John Mercanti and it was first released by the United States Mint on November 24, 1986. It is struck only in the one troy ounce size, which has a nominal face value of one dollar and is guaranteed to contain one troy ounce of 99.9% pure silver. It is authorized by and codified as (e)-(h). Its content, weight, and purity are certified by the United States Mint. In addition to the bullion version, the United States Mint has produced a proof version and an uncirculated version for coin collectors. The Silver Eagle has been produced at three mints: the Philadelphia Mint, the San Francisco Mint, and the West Point Mint. The American Silver Eagle bullion coin may be used to fund Individual Retirement Account investments.

=== Sacagawea dollar (2000–present) ===

The Sacagawea dollar was authorized by Congress in 1997 because the supply of Anthony dollars in inventory since their last mintage in 1981 was soon expected to be depleted. These coins have a copper core clad in manganese brass. Delays in increasing Sacagawea dollar production led to a final 1999-dated mintage of Susan B. Anthony dollars. Dollar coins are used infrequently in general commerce. They used to be given as change by United States Postal Service (USPS) stamp vending machines, which created a relatively small but significant demand, but the USPS eliminated all those machines by 2011. They were also used in certain subway and public transit systems, such as the Boston subway and New York City Subway ticketing machines.

In 1998, the U.S. Mint conducted a limited design competition for the new dollar, inviting 23 artists to submit designs portraying Sacagawea on the obverse (&quot;heads&quot;) side and an American bald eagle on the reverse (&quot;tails&quot;) side. In November 1998, an exhibit of 123 submitted designs was held at the Casa Italiana Hall in Washington, D.C., to solicit public and private comment. Design concepts were submitted in the form of drawings, renderings, sculpture, and die-struck prototypes.

The obverse was designed by artist Glenna Goodacre. Since no verifiable image of Sacagawea exists, Goodacre used Randy&#x27;L He-dow Teton, a University of New Mexico college student and a Shoshone Indian, as a model for the coin.

There are approximately 1 billion Sacagawea coins in circulation and about 250 million in reserve. The U.S. Mint greatly reduced production of Sacagawea dollars after the 2001 minting, citing sufficient inventory. From 2002 to 2008, the Sacagawea dollar was still minted for collectors and was available in uncirculated rolls, mint sets, and proof sets, but it was not released for general circulation again until the introduction of the Native American series in 2009.

The Mint took great care to create the coin with the same size, weight, and electromagnetic properties as the Anthony dollar, but with a golden color. Unlike most other coins in circulation, the selected alloy has a tendency to tarnish quite severely in circulation, as is the case with most brasses, resulting in a loss of the golden shine, except on raised areas where the &quot;patina&quot; is more frequently rubbed off. While some consider the blackening an undesirable quality, the Mint suggests the uneven tarnishing effect gives the coins an &quot;antique finish&quot; that &quot;accentuate[s] the profile and add[s] a dimension of depth to the depiction of Sacagawea and her child&quot;.

The coin featured a plain edge through 2008, but starting in 2009, incused lettering was applied. The year and mint mark moved from the coin&#x27;s obverse (front) to its edge.

, dollar coins are not widely encountered in U.S. commerce, except in vending machines for rides on mass transit, some pay and display machines, some laundromats, and old-fashioned slot machines. On the other hand, the Sacagawea dollar has achieved popularity in El Salvador, Ecuador, and Panama, where the U.S. dollar is also the official currency.

==== Native American series ====

With the passage of the Native American $1 Coin Act on September 20, 2007, the U.S. Mint began designing a series of Sacagawea dollars with modified reverses to further commemorate &quot;Native Americans and the important contributions made by Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to the development of the United States and the history of the United States&quot;. Four designs were to be minted, each for one year from 2009 to 2012. The first Native American series coin was released in January 2009 and had a reverse that depicted a Native American woman sowing seeds of the Three Sisters, symbolizing the Indian tribes&#x27; contributions to agriculture.

Like the Presidential Dollar, the year of issue, mint mark, and motto &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; are found on the edge of the coin instead of on the obverse or reverse, which allows for more room for the design. Unlike the Presidential $1 coins from before 2009, &quot;In God We Trust&quot; remains on the obverse and the vacant space on the edge lettering has been taken up by thirteen stars, symbolizing the Thirteen Colonies. Also, unlike any other denomination of circulating U.S. coinage (but in common with the Presidential $1 coins), the value is inscribed in numerals on the reverse. The act passed by Congress requires that 20% of the total dollar coins minted in any year during the Presidential $1 Coin Program be Sacagawea dollars bearing the new design.

In January 2010, the second reverse design in the series was released which has the theme of &quot;Government&quot; and the &quot;Great Tree of Peace&quot;. The 2010 Sacagawea reverse depicts the Hiawatha Belt and five arrows bound together representing unity with the inscription &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, a synonym for the Iroquois Confederacy meaning &quot;People of the Longhouse&quot;. Another inscription is found along the lower edge of the reverse spelling &quot;Great Law of Peace&quot; (an English translation of Gayanashagowa, the Iroquois Confederacy constitution). The Great Law of Peace was used as a model for the Constitution of the United States. The four links on the belt are meant to symbolize four of the five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, namely the Mohawk, Oneida, Cayuga and Seneca Nations. The Eastern White Pine tree in the middle of the belt represents the fifth Nation, the Onondaga, and is a depiction of the Tree of Peace.

=== Presidential Dollar Coins (2007–2016; 2020) ===

In December 2005, Congress decided to create a new series of $1 coins that would honor the former U.S. presidents. In 2007, Presidential coins of four different designs were produced. Another four designs will be produced each year, honoring the presidents in order of service. (Grover Cleveland is on two coins since he served two non-consecutive terms.) The Presidential $1 Coin Act is intended to create renewed interest in dollar coins, like that seen during the 50 State Quarters program. At least one-third of all dollar coins produced are still Sacagawea coins, with the remaining coins making up the four presidential coins produced annually. Under federal law (), no coins may be issued featuring a living president, or a president who died less than two years earlier.

The presidential dollar coin is the same size and composition as the Sacagawea dollar. &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, the issue year, and the mint mark appear on the edge. The first dollar, honoring George Washington, was released into circulation on February 15, 2007.
However, became law on December 26, 2007, which moved &quot;In God We Trust&quot; from the edge to the obverse.

A common minting error on this coin, estimated at 80,000, from a mintage of 300,000,000 coins, is the omission of the edge lettering causing a plain outside edge. Because the omission includes the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, some in the popular media have dubbed it the &quot;godless&quot; coin. A false (although at one time widely reported) error is the report that the edge lettering is upside down. The edge lettering does not occur at the same time as the minting of the coins, allowing for the natural occurrence of the lettering in either orientation, except Proof Coins where the date and lettering are all &quot;right-side-up&quot;.

Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins, the production of new presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 11, 2011, by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Further minting of these coins was reserved solely for collectors.

===American Innovation Dollar Coins (2018–2032)===

On July 20, 2018, then-President Donald Trump signed the American Innovation $1 Coin Act into law. The program calls for the release of four new coins each year from 2019 through 2032 &quot;to honor innovation and innovators by issuing $1 coins for each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories – Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands&quot;. An introductory coin, commemorating George Washington signing the country&#x27;s first patent into law, was released in December 2018. The coins are currently only being minted for collectors.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Turners is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London.

The Turners&#x27; Company is one of the oldest Livery Companies in the City of London. Its origins go back to early medieval times: the first reference to a London turner dates to 1189, though the charter is dated 1155. The medieval Company was a trade guild, set up to protect the interests of its members, whose skill was to turn and shape wooden objects on a lathe. They laid down standards for their products; they had a strict system of apprenticeship; they restricted competition from outsiders; and they collected for charity and funeral expenses. Unlike the richer Livery Companies the Turners were craftsmen, not merchants. Yet at a time when many everyday necessities, like chairs, cups and plates, were turned products, successful London turners could make a good living by the standards of the day.
The contemporary Turners&#x27; Company reflects many of the traditions of earlier days. Its main objective remains to promote the craft of turning, which, in the 21st century, encompasses a broad spectrum of styles from the traditional and practical to the intricate and ornate right through to large statement pieces and avant garde works of art. Both professional turners and amateurs are members of the Company.
The Company promotes the craft of turning by running a major exhibition, known as &quot;Wizardry in Wood&quot;, every four years. It holds turning competitions, and offers prizes and bursaries to established and aspirant turners. It supports the Register of Professional Turners, which gives details of leading turners and what they make.

The Company received its royal charter from King James 1st in 1604, and is 51st in the order of precedence of City Livery Companies.

The company motto is &quot;By Faith I Obteigne&quot;, or, in Modern English, &quot;By Faith I Obtain&quot;.

==Masters of the Turners&#x27; Company==
*1783: Onesimus Ustonson
*1818: John Ustonson
*1965: Hugh Lindley-Jones
*1980–1981: Sir Brian Neill
*1987–1988: Sir Leonard Atkinson

<text>Bradgate Park () is a public park in Charnwood Forest, in Leicestershire, England, northwest of Leicester. It covers . The park lies between the villages of Newtown Linford, Anstey, Cropston, Woodhouse Eaves and Swithland. The River Lin runs through the park, flowing into Cropston Reservoir which was constructed on part of the park. To the north-east lies Swithland Wood. The park&#x27;s two well known landmarks, Old John and the war memorial, both lie just above the contour. The park is part of the 399.3 hectare Bradgate Park and Cropston Reservoir Site of Special Scientific Interest, which has been designated under both biological and geological criteria.

Following a fire in April 2017, the owners Bradgate Trust advised that all visitors are expected to be alert to the risk of causing fire, though another fire in June destroyed one of the ancient oaks.

== History ==
The area now enclosed as Bradgate Park was one of a number of parks surrounding Charnwood Forest. Since medieval times it has been part of the Manor of Groby. In the reign of Edward the Confessor, the area was owned by a landowner named Ulf. The manor, along with some 100 others in and around Leicestershire, was awarded to Hugh de Grandmesnil in the eleventh century as reward for his assistance in battle to William I. The name Bradgate is thought to derive from Norse or Anglo-Saxon, meaning &quot;broad road&quot; or &quot;broad gate&quot; respectively. The first mention of Bradgate Park is from 1241, by which time it was laid out as a hunting park, although rather smaller than the current boundary. It was subsequently acquired by the Beaumont family, passing to the de Quincy family and on to William de Ferrers of Groby. It remained in the de Ferrers family until 1445, when it passed to the Grey family after William&#x27;s only surviving daughter married Edward Grey. The inquisition into the estates of de Ferrers, made after his death, mentions the park, with &quot;herbage, pannage and underwood, worth 40 shillings yearly&quot;. The Grey family retained it for the next 500 years, and in the 19th century was opened to the public several days a week. In 1928 it was bought by Charles Bennion and given, as a plaque in the park describes, &#x27;to be preserved in its a natural state for the quiet enjoyment of the people of Leicestershire&#x27;.

===Medieval deer park===
The park was originally enclosed using a bank and ditch topped by vertical pales of oak. These first ditchworks cross the River Lyn east of the Little Matlock Gorge. A parker, living in a moated house, was the only occupant, maintaining stocks of deer for the lord of Groby Manor to hunt. The park was greatly extended by the first marquis in the late 15th century, to occupy land previously farmed by both Newtown Linford and the now lost village of Bradgate. Lichen dating of the dry-stone walls suggest that the north and west boundary walls were built in the 17th and early 18th centuries, when Bradgate was still occupied by the earls of Stamford. The walled spinneys are a later feature, built and planted in the early 19th century as coverts for shooting. The park still has herds of red and fallow deer, which probably have an unbroken occupancy since medieval times.

===Bradgate House===

Edward Grey&#x27;s son Sir John Grey of Groby married Elizabeth Woodville, who after John&#x27;s death married King Edward IV. Their son Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, prepared for building Bradgate House in the late fifteenth century but died before he was able to begin. It was his son Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, who built Bradgate House, the likely completion date being 1520.
There is now some confusion over this completion date however, as an older house has been discovered under the visible walls and findings have suggested that Lady Jane Grey, who wasn&#x27;t born until 12 October 1537, lived in the older house.

Sir Thomas Grey died in 1530 and was succeeded by his son Henry, the 3rd Marquess of Dorset, who was married to Frances, the daughter of the Duke of Suffolk and Mary Tudor, King Henry VIII&#x27;s younger sister. 

Their daughter Lady Jane Grey was born at Bradgate House probably in October 1537. Notably in July 1553, at the age of fifteen, the Duke of Northumberland (her husband&#x27;s father) proclaimed her Queen of England and Ireland, in opposition to Mary Tudor. However Mary had more support, and when the Lord Mayor of London proclaimed Mary queen on 19 July, the Duke of Northumberland lost all support, and he, his son, and Lady Jane Grey, the Nine Days Queen, were beheaded for treason.

There is a longstanding tradition that the oak trees of Bradgate were pollarded at the time of Lady Jane&#x27;s death. Pollarding of the trees was a practice that was undertaken then, as before and since as it kept the new growth high up, away from browsing deer and has enabled the ancient trees to reach their great age. It is not known if the estate workers of 1554 attached any particular significance to the practice. 


===Old John===
A prominent landmark is the folly known as &#x27;Old John&#x27; on the top of the highest hill in the park. Built by the Greys in 1784, the folly is, by local legend, a memorial to John, an estate worker killed in a bonfire accident during celebrations of the 21st birthday of the future sixth Earl of Stamford. It is reputed that the stonework at the side of the tower was altered to look like a handle, perhaps knowing John&#x27;s liking of ale. However he was not 21 until 1786, and a map of 1745 names the hill as &#x27;Old John&#x27;. The tower was used during the 19th century as a viewing point for the horse-racing practice circuit laid out by the seventh earl.

In 2001, Bradgate Park Trust registered the design of the building as a trademark, and in 2018 told a local artist that she would have to pay them if she continued to sell her paintings of it.

===Cropston Reservoir===
Cropston Reservoir was constructed in the south-east corner of the park in 1871, submerging the Head Keeper&#x27;s house and a substantial area of former parkland. It was Leicester&#x27;s second reservoir (after Thornton), built in response to the 1831 and 1841 cholera epidemics. The water level was raised in 1887, to increase capacity and the original steam powered beam engines ran until 1956. A number of pools were also constructed along the course of the River Lin through the park, to allow silt to settle before reaching the reservoir. A second, covered reservoir was added on the northern side of the park in the early 1960s.

===Proposed railway===
In 1899, a Private member&#x27;s Bill was presented to Parliament for the formation and construction of the Leicester, Groby and Bradgate Park Railway. At a distance of 5 miles, 4 furlongs and 1.4 chains long, the railway was planned to run from Newtown Linford, through Sheet Hedges Wood, under Bradgate Road, and then via Cropston to a junction with the Great Central Main Line within Thurcaston parish, to the north of Rothley railway station. The proponents of the bill stated that the primary purpose of the line would be to carry passengers. In reality, the aim of the promoters was for the new railway to take granite from Sheet Hedges Quarry to the Great Central Railway, as well as potentially encourage the opening of quarries in Bradgate Park. The proposal ultimately failed however, as the Commons Committee meeting on 20 March 1899 felt that the argument in favour of building the railway was insufficient.

===Public park===
In 1905 the estate was bequeathed on the death of the 7th Earl of Stamford&#x27;s widow to the earl&#x27;s niece, Mrs Arthur Duncombe. Limited public access had been allowed while the park was in the hands of the Greys. In 1928, the ancient Deer Park with the ruins of Bradgate House was included in the sale of the whole Grey estate and the Park was bought by local businessman and British United Shoe Machinery founder Charles Bennion who gave it in perpetuity to the people of Leicestershire. Plaques on Old John and the main path through the park commemorate the gift. Bennion&#x27;s son subsequently added the gift of an adjacent piece of land, and in 1936 the City Council purchased an additional 46.5 acres of land abutting the park. The nearby Swithland Wood had previously been sold in 1921 to the Leicester timber merchant William Gimson, who began to extract the timber commercially, with the aim of dividing up the land for building plots as it was gradually cleared. Following public concern about the threatened loss of this ancient woodland of importance for its geological, natural history and industrial history features, in 1925 the Rotary Club of Leicester, with the cooperation of William Gimson, bought the whole site of approximately for preservation and to provide access to the public for recreation &quot;as a national heritage&quot;. The Rotary Club established the Swithland Wood Trust, repaired and renewed the fencing of the area, provided car parking and restored the paths, spending around £6,000 on the original purchase, fencing and landscaping. The Club opened Swithland Wood to the public on August Bank Holiday, 2 August 1925, employing its own staff to manage the Wood and visitor services. In 1928 the Club initiated the annual Bluebell Service in the Wood, in partnership with Swithland Parish Church. On 29 December 1929 the Bradgate Park Charity with trustees nominated by the County Council and the National Trust was established to manage Charles Bennion&#x27;s purchase and gift of Bradgate Park, with the appropriate senior officers of the Council providing the necessary professional and administrative services, including land management, legal, secretariat and financial support. Although there does not seem to have been a formal opening of Bradgate Park, public access to the Park became available soon afterwards in 1929. In 1931, once the Bradgate Park Trust was fully operational and established, the Rotary Club approached the County Council and trustees about the possibility of merging the two properties and charities under the Bradgate Park trustees and this was completed in 1931. The park is now administered by the Bradgate Park and Swithland Wood Charitable Trust, with trustees nominated by Leicestershire County Council, Leicester City Council and the National Trust. With the consent of the Charity Commission, the charity has adopted the shorter working title of Bradgate Park Trust.

=== Civil parish ===
It was formerly an extra-parochial tract, in 1858 Bradgate Park became a separate civil parish, on 25 March 1884 the parish was abolished and merged with Newtown Linford, Anstey and Ulverscroft. In 1881 the parish had a population of 6.

== Geology ==

The visible geology in Bradgate Park ranges from some of the oldest (Precambrian) fossil bearing rocks in England to the youngest (Quaternary). The rock outcrops were created in conditions varying from volcanos rising out of the ocean, to magma flowing deep underground and from tropical deserts to Ice sheets. Within the park the outcrops are widely distributed as hillside crags and outcrops, both along the valley sides of the River Lin and on the hilltop of Old John. They include rocks with some of the oldest known developed forms of fossil animal life in Western Europe.

===Precambrian rocks===
The Precambrian outcrops include four &#x27;type-members&#x27; of the Charnian Supergroup, formed some 560 million years ago. Bradgate is one of the few areas of Britain where these ancient basement rocks can be seen at the surface. The oldest of the Charnian rocks within Bradgate Park are the rocks nearest the Old John and memorial summits. This is the Beacon Hill Formation. It appears to have formed in deep water, out of sediments of volcanic ash and other pyroclastic material, which were then subject to slumping and submarine flows, to create rocks with various degrees of stratification. The volcano itself was in the north-west of Charnwood Forest, and the whole area was in the southern tropic, off the coast of the continent of Gondwana. (A modern parallel might be the sea surrounding Montserrat.) Some of the layers show great variation, showing how an initial volcanic eruption would result in larger sediments rapidly settling to create course-grained tuff, followed by settling of much finer material to form much smoother dust-tuffs – smooth light-grey to creamy coloured rocks seen to the north of Old John. The various layers were subsequently deeply buried, subject to vast periods of mountain-building (orogeny), heat, pressure and erosion of overlying material, to expose the hard, jagged outcrops seen in the photograph.

Overlying the Beacon Hill Formation, but found a little further down the hillside to the south, are the Bradgate Formation beds, the most notable of which is the Sliding Stone Slump Breccia rocks. Forming a line of crags below Old John, these are laminated mudstones, with layers of sandstone, mainly of volcanic origin. The beds are substantially warped, contorted and folded. Many of the more intricate folds and &#x27;sag&#x27; patterns are thought to have occurred while the sediments were unconsolidated and water saturated. Suggested causes for these include slumping, earth tremors and fault-movements, trapped water or gases and volcanic bomb impacts. Outcrops of other rocks of the Bradgate Formation are found further down the slope. These are younger than and stratigraphically above the breccia, but the uplift from ancient mountain-building, the dip of the beds and erosion of overlying rocks mean that the younger rocks are encountered at progressively lower altitudes.

The youngest of the Precambrian rocks are the South Charnwood Diorites. These are known locally as granite, (geologically they were formerly described as markfieldite) and are quarried commercially at Groby and Markfield. These are igneous intrusions of magma which formed within the existing Beacon Hill and Bradgate Formations. They cooled slowly and at great depth to create their large crystalline structure, and were subsequently exposed by erosion of the uplifted rocks above. The Diorites are the cliffs and blocks seen along the Lin valley, through the so-called Little Matlock Gorge and near Bradgate House. They are massive blocky outcrops made up of crystals of feldspar, quartz and mafic minerals.

===Cambrian rocks===

An area of rock overlooking Cropston Reservoir is of Hanging Rocks Formation, the only other example being at Hangingstone Hills, near the Outwoods, 4 km to the north. It is unclear if this is late Precambrian or early Cambrian. It is distinguished by conglomerates with well-rounded volcanic pebbles mostly 5–15 mm but some up to 100 mm in diameter, which may have been smoothed on a volcanic shoreline before being washed, along with much finer material, into deeper water. These are younger than the Bradgate Formation, but again at a lower altitude. A possibly explanation is that it formed in a channel cut into the existing sea floor, but a preferred conclusion is that movement along fault-lines has relocated it relative to its surrounding rocks. The relationship between the different outcrops in Bradgate are made more obscure by the overlying peat and Boulder clay, which mean the contacts between adjacent stratigraphic sequences are nowhere exposed.

Previously classed as precambrian, but now accepted as early Cambrian are the Brand Group of rocks which include Swithland Slate, locally important as a source of roof slates and gravestones. The nearby Swithland Wood has extensive outcrops and was one of the principal quarry areas until the mid 19th century. Rocks close in age to the slate can be seen in the &#x27;stable pit&#x27;, a medieval quarry near Bradgate House. This outcrop is part of the Brand Group and is known as the Stable Pit Member, a Quartz arenite rock with a smooth glassy appearance. A metre-wide dyke of diorite also runs through the exposed rocks of the quarry, possibly of late Ordovician age, which places it at a similar age to the Mountsorrel granite formations.

===Triassic rocks===
During the Triassic period, some 350 million years after those ancient rocks were formed, they were exposed due to the erosion of the rocks above. By this point they were part of the Pangea supercontinent and desert conditions resulted in an accumulation of windblown Loess, which now forms the Mercia Mudstone Group. With the subsequent sinking of the East Midlands crust, these deposits became waterlogged and formed into red clay. It is this clay that was used to make the bricks for Bradgate House. The mudstone is only visible where it was extracted, across the stream from Bradgate House. However, it covers much of the valley floor around and beneath Cropston Reservoir, – demonstrating that the present Lin valley was also there 220 million years ago.

===Quaternary deposits===
Bradgate Park and its surrounding areas were heavily overlain in the (geologically) recent past by glacial deposits of Boulder Clay. The Quaternary period includes the last ice age. As the ice melted, some 10,000 years ago, the solid material within the ice settled over the &#x27;natural&#x27; rocks below. This material includes unsorted clay and sand particles, small and large pebbles and large stones and boulders. It travelled great distances within the ice sheets and glaciers, so individual rocks, whether on the ground, or within the great lengths of stone walls of the Park, may be local stone, or may be a specimen from northern Britain or even from northern Europe.

===Precambrian fossils===
The fossils at Bradgate and in other nearby Charnian rocks are the only known Precambrian fossils in Western Europe. Until 1957 it had been thought that complex life forms and perhaps life itself began with the Cambrian Period and that all rocks older than this developed in a world without plants or animals. The 1957 discoveries, by Roger Mason, in rocks near Woodhouse Eaves, subsequently named in his honour as &quot;Charnia masoni&quot;, required a re-evaluation of when life began. It also resulted in the re-classification of other rocks in Southern Australia and Newfoundland, which have similar fossil marks. At Bradgate Park there are some 50 known examples. They mainly take the form of two-dimensional impressions of fronds and disks and have at various times been described as seaweed, jelly fish, corals or sea anemones. They are now described as belonging to the Ediacara biota, with no consensus on which kingdom, current or extinct, they should be placed. The Bradgate examples include &quot;Bradgatia linfordensis&quot; and &quot;Charniodiscus concentricus&quot; as well as &quot;Charnia masoni&quot;. Because of the risk of vandalism and damage, specific locations of these fossils are not disclosed and those wishing to investigate them should first of all seek the permission of the Bradgate Park Trust. None of the rocks in Bradgate Park should be chipped, hammered, or otherwise sampled, replicated or removed.

== Flora and fauna ==

The landscape is rocky moorland with a covering of coarse grass and bracken. Several spinneys of woodland (pine and mixed deciduous) are enclosed by stone walls and are not accessible to the public. There are a number of magnificent specimens of ancient oaks several hundreds of years old. The park is home to herds of red deer and fallow deer. Birdlife is profuse – the reservoir attracts many species of wildfowl, as does the river and the spinneys provide secluded nesting areas for many other species, including large colonies of rooks. Species such as yellowhammer, reed bunting, skylark and meadow pipit are a common sight in the open areas of the park. Deadly nightshade is allowed to grow within the ruins of Bradgate House, having been originally established there during World War II by Leicester Polytechnic&#x27;s School of Pharmacy for medicinal purposes.

===Dogs===
As of 2015 deer numbers were around 450 but concerns have been raised about dogs chasing deer. Trust notices displayed at the entrances now advise that dogs must be on a lead in specified areas near the main footpath. Dogs are allowed off lead in around 75% of the area of the park, so long as they are kept under effective control and do not worry the deer. The Daily Telegraph highlighted Bradgate in an article referencing the busybodies charter though it failed to mention the deer.

==Café and information centres==
In July 2016 a visitor centre opened in the Deer Barn buildings off the main path east of Bradgate House in addition to the existing cafe. The geology section features details of the park&#x27;s formation during its stages of volcanism, glacial erosion and inhabitation by Ediacara biota. It also shows the tracks of a later land based lizard. The archaeology section features work by Leicester University beginning in 2014 and includes evidence of Creswellian sites from 14,500 years ago. 

The Deer Barns café in the centre of the park is open 7 days a week and offers sandwiches, toasties, jacket potatoes and other cold snacks and hot and cold drinks.

There is also a café at the Newtown Linford car park which is operated externally as of 2021.

== Access ==

===Car===
Pay&amp;Display car parks are operated at the Hallgates entrance and Hunts Hill (at the top of the park near Old John). At Newtown Linford an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system is in operation and visitors pay on exit. The park is open from dawn until dusk all year round, though the public footpaths which run through the area mean that in practice the park is always accessible.

===Bus===
A limited service 125 operates by the Newtown Linford entrance Monday to Saturday and Arriva 29B operates an infrequent Sunday service both serve Leicester City Centre and Coalville.

===Walking===
One path is directly opposite the bus stop on Link Road, between Cropston Road and Hazelhead Road. The path is signposted from Link Road and crosses several fields before entering the park proper. Another route, which joins the main path, is accessible from the edge of the village, adjacent to the last houses on Bradgate Road.

===Cycling===
The park is within easy cycling distance from the city centre of Leicester.

<text>Leszek II the Black (c. 1241 – 30 September 1288), was a Polish prince of the House of Piast, Duke of Sieradz since 1261, Duke of Łęczyca since 1267, Duke of Inowrocław in the years 1273-1278, Duke of Sandomierz and High Duke of Poland from 1279 until his death.

== Early years ==

Leszek was the eldest son of Duke Casimir I of Kuyavia and his second wife, Constance, daughter of Henry II the Pious from the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty. His nickname, &quot;Black&quot; (Latin: &quot;Niger&quot;), appears for the first time in the 14th century &quot;Kronika Dzierzwy&quot;, and was probably given to him for his dark hair.

In 1257 his mother died, and shortly after his father married Euphrosyne, daughter of Casimir I of Opole. Leszek&#x27;s stepmother soon caused conflicts in the family with her attempts to obtain territorial benefits for her own children. The eldest of them was the future Polish king Władysław I the Elbow-high. This was to the detriment of Leszek and his younger full-brother, Ziemomysł. Some chronicles even accused Euphrosyne of attempting to poison both stepsons. Leszek and Ziemomysł rebelled against their father and stepmother in 1261 (although the participation of Ziemomysł is debated in historiography). The revolt initially failed because the local nobility, dissatisfied with their adventurous policy, retired their support; however, thanks to the help of a coalition formed with Bolesław V the Chaste, Siemowit I of Masovia, and Bolesław the Pious, Leszek eventually forced his father to give him the district of Sieradz as a separate duchy.

==Duke of Sieradz==

Leszek&#x27;s rule as Duke of Sieradz lasted from 1261 until 1279. His new duchy was formed from one of the less populated lands in the country. However, the colonization policy which he pursued (including the foundation of cities like Nowa Brzeźnica, Lutomiersk, Wolbórz, and Radomsko) and the close cooperation with the Church slowly changed the image of the district.

In 1267 Casimir died, leaving his domains to his five sons. Leszek, as the oldest son and already in possession of Sieradz, only added Łęczyca. One year later, the citizens of Inowrocław rebelled against the pro-German policy of Ziemomysł and called for Bolesław the Pious to be their new ruler. Ziemomysł, however, managed to kept the government until 1271, when Bolesław finally invaded the duchy forcing Ziemomysł to escape. Bolesław kept the district for two years, until 1273, when he gave it to Leszek, who was now unexpectedly Duke of Inowrocław. His government over this land lasted until 1278, when after a meeting at Ląd on 24 August, and thanks to the mediation of Przemysł II of Greater Poland, Leszek returned the duchy to his brother.

==Adoption by Bolesław the Chaste==

After Leszek obtained his political independence in 1261, he rapidly established good relations with Bolesław the Chaste, ruler of Kraków and Sandomierz. The two princes meet for the first time in 1260, on occasion of the expedition against the Kingdom of Bohemia, which was part of a broader action during the Hungarian-Bohemian War for the Babenberg inheritance. Leszek&#x27;s participation in the war against Bohemia and its allies (Henryk IV Probus and Władysław Opolski) continued in later years, with particular intensity between 1271-1273.

The childlessness of Bolesław and his close cooperation with Leszek resulted in the latter&#x27;s expectation to become his heir. The document of adoption was issued in 1265; eight years later, Władysław Opolski organized a military expedition to Kraków because he refused to accept the adoption. On 4 June 1273, the Battle of Bogucin Mały took place, in which the Opole-Racibórz army was defeated. At the end of October, Bolesław made a retaliatory expedition against Opole-Racibórz; however, his forces were limited to destroy only specific areas of the duchy. In 1274 Władysław Opolski and Bolesław the Chaste decided to conclude a peace, under which the former gave up his claims to the throne of Kraków in exchange for some territory adjacent to his duchy, stretching as far as the Skawinka river.

In 1265 Leszek married Gryfina (also known as Agrippina), daughter of the Rurikid prince Rostislav Mikhailovich, Ban of Slavonia and Duke of Macsó. The union was quite unhappy; in 1271 a scandal erupted when she fled to Kraków and publicly accused her husband of impotence, adding that for this reason their marriage had never been consummated. The reconciliation of the couple took place four years later, due to the intervention of Bolesław the Chaste and his wife, Kinga, Gryfina returned to her husband on 6 August 1275. Leszek then decided to follow a treatment from the well-known physician Mikołaj of Kraków. His prescription included eating frogs and snakes, because - as was stated in the &quot;Rocznik Traski&quot; - &quot;the lack of offspring caused a great abomination into the nation&quot;. Ultimately, Leszek and Gryfina never had children.

==Duke of Kraków and Sandomierz==
On 7 December 1279 Bolesław the Chaste died. In accordance with his wishes, the duchies of Kraków and Sandomierz were inherited by Leszek II, who became the new high duke. The succession took place without much difficulty, although it is probable that Leszek was forced to agree to a formal election as Duke of Kraków.

The beginning of his reign was unfortunately not peaceful. Unexpectedly, Leo I of Galicia, with the help of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, planned an invasion of Kraków. With the help of Lithuanians, Tartars, and some Russian principalities, Leo invaded Lublin in February 1280, crossed the Vistula, and besieged Sandomierz, which managed to resist. From that point Leszek was able to unite enough forces to repel the invasion. The final battle took place in Goźlice on 23 February, where the Polish forces (under the command of Peter, voivode of Kraków, and Janusz, voivode of Sandomierz), forced Leo&#x27;s army to flee. Later that year, Leszek organized a retaliatory expedition, which burned and destroyed the border areas up to Lviv.

The following year, Leszek attacked the Duchy of Wrocław, which belonged to Henryk IV Probus. This was in response for the imprisonment of Leszek&#x27;s ally, Przemysł II, after a meeting in probably Barycz. This expedition, besides the significant bounty it brought him, did not yield the expected result.

The following years were also not peaceful. In 1282 the Yotvingians invaded Lublin and plundered several villages. Because of this unexpected attack they were able to advance to Łopiennik Górny. Leszek, after the initial surprise, managed to pursue the invaders and somewhere beyond the Narew river they clashed in a bloody battle. The Yotvingians were slaughtered, and this defeat effectively destroyed the combat strength of the tribe. One year later, the Lithuanians made a retaliatory expedition, but Leszek was able to defeat them in the Battle of Rowiny.

==Conflict with the Bishop of Kraków==

Despite all of his military victories, Leszek&#x27;s position within Kraków-Sandomierz was not that strong. During almost all of his reign he had to fight with internal opposition. The leading opponents to his rule were , Bishop of Kraków, and Janusz Starża, voivode of Sandomierz. The dispute with Bishop Paweł began in the early 1280s, when Leszek II refused to approve the bishop&#x27;s broad immunity. The widow of Bolesław, Kinga of Hungary, also had an important role in this conflict. According to her husband&#x27;s will, she received the district of Stary Sącz as her dower. Because it was on the road to Hungary, this district was strategic and important, and Leszek II considered it to be too valuable to be in her hands. However, another motive may have been that he wanted to give that land to his own wife Gryfina. During 1282-1283, the conflict came to its most dramatic stage, when Bishop Paweł (who fiercely supported Kinga&#x27;s rights) was captured after a meeting at Łagów and imprisoned in Sieradz. The Bishop of Kraków only regained his freedom thanks to the consistent intervention of the Polish Church. A final settlement was signed on 30 November 1286 when Leszek agreed to pay Bishop Paweł 3,000 grzywnas as compensation for damages, return his property, and recognize the Bishopric&#x27;s privileges.

==Knighthood revolts==

The government of Leszek also garnered opposition from the local knights, which would be surprising given the numerous times that they served the High Duke in his victorious expeditions. The first revolt took place in 1282, when the voivode Janusz Starża, using the absence of Leszek II, gave the fortresses of Sandomierz and Radom to Konrad II of Czersk. This rebellion was quickly suppressed, if it ever occurred at all (as the first information about it came from Jan Długosz, and strangely the voivode remained in his post).

A more serious revolt took place three years later, in April 1285, when Otto Toporczyk, voivode of Sandomierz, Janusz Starża, the former voivode and now castellan of Kraków, and Żegota, voivode of Kraków, raised an army against Leszek II, who having been taken by surprise was forced to escape to Hungary. Fortunately for Leszek II, the rebels&#x27; candidate for the throne, Konrad II of Czersk, failed to take the Wawel Castle, which was defended by the faithful local burghers, led by High Duchess Gryfina. On 3 May 1285, a decisive battle took place in Bogucice, where Leszek II, with the help of the Hungarians, obtained a great victory and forced the rebels to leave the country. After overcoming this opposition, Leszek II modified his local policies so that the government was more stable through the end of his reign.

==Final years==

In 1287-1288 the third invasion of the Mongols into Lesser Poland, led by Nogai Khan and Talabuga, took place, causing Leszek to travel to Hungary and ask for help. This time, Lesser Poland was better prepared for the Mongol invasion than for the previous two incursions, with several more fortresses in Kraków and Sandomierz to defend the lands.

It is believed that Leszek II initiated a process for the unification of Poland. According to the theory of historian Oswald Balzer, Leszek II called the First Piast Coalition, formed by four princes: Henryk IV Probus, Przemysł II, Henry III of Głogów, and himself, on or about 1287, whose main purpose was to arrange the order of succession in Lesser Poland. This hypothesis is refuted by modern historiography because of the known bad relations between Leszek II, Przemysł II, and Henryk IV Probus during this period. On the other hand, the apparent national unification could have been a result of the growing cult to Saint Stanislaus of Szczepanów.

Leszek died on 30 September 1288 at Kraków and was buried in the local Dominican Church of the Holy Trinity. After his death a violent dispute erupted among the main Piast rulers for the Seniorate Province. Eventually, Henryk IV Probus became the new high duke in 1289, but his sudden death one year later caused the Seniorate Province to pass to Przemysł II. However, he was deposed soon thereafter (1291) on behalf of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, who claimed Poland. Having no legal grounds to reign, Wenceslaus II managed to obtain a document from his aunt Dowager Duchess Gryfina under which she ceded to him the district of Stary Sącz, which she finally received as her dower, with the doubtful inclusion of all of the Seniorate Province.

<doc id="374815" wikidata="Q5914558" url="?curid=374815" title="House banking scandal">
<text>The House banking scandal broke in early 1992, when it was revealed that the US House of Representatives allowed its members to overdraw their House checking accounts without the risk of being penalized by the House bank, which was actually a clearinghouse.

The scandal also sometimes known as Rubbergate (from the expressions &quot;rubber check&quot; (bounced check) and &quot;Watergate),&quot; but the term is misleading because House checks did not bounce but were honored because the House Bank provided overdraft protection to its account holders, and the Office of the Sergeant at Arms covered the House Bank with no penalties.

It is also sometimes known as the &quot;check-kiting scandal.&quot;

== Description ==
The House banking scandal ultimately involved more than 450 representatives, most of whom did not break any laws. However, 22 members of Congress were singled out by the House Ethics Committee for leaving their checking accounts overdrawn for at least eight months out of a sample of 39 months:
Four ex-representatives, one delegate, and the former House Sergeant at Arms were convicted of wrongdoing as a result of the investigation that followed.

Among them, former Representative Buz Lukens (R-OH) was convicted on bribery and conspiracy charges. Former Representative Carl C. Perkins (D-KY) pleaded guilty to various charges including a check kiting scheme involving several financial institutions including the House Bank. Former Representative Carroll Hubbard (D-KY) pleaded guilty to three felonies. The former Sergeant at Arms, Jack Russ, pleaded guilty to three felonies.


Many US banks, like the House Bank, offered overdraft protection to checking account holders. However, the overdrafts in a regular bank&#x27;s overdraft protection program are always secured by a line of credit with the bank extended under standard lending protocols, including interest charges, if any, linkage of the protected checking account to another account with the necessary funds to pay the overdraft, such as a savings account; or charges made to a credit card held by the depositor.

The credit unions existed long before the scandal. However, the Office of the House Sergeant-at-Arms had offered a much more-convenient clearing house for Members of Congress&#x27; checks, and overdraft protection was managed in a much more lenient (and less expensive) manner than that by the credit unions or, for that matter, any chartered bank.

== Public exposure ==
In the early days of the scandal, when the media began reporting on the loose practices, Republican Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, along with seven freshman Republicans referred to as the Gang of Seven, or &quot;The Young Turks,&quot; made the strategic decision to publicize the scandal in an attempt to sweep representatives with overdrawn accounts, most of whom were Democrats, out of power, although Gingrich himself had 22 overdrawn checks, one being a $9,463 check to the Internal Revenue Service. Jim Nussle, one of the Gang of Seven, came to national attention when he made a speech from the well of the House while he wore a paper bag over his head to protest the &quot;shameful&quot; ethical behavior involved in the scandal.

Gingrich pressured the Speaker of the House, Tom Foley, to ensure that the special counsel appointed to investigate the matter informed the voting public of the overdrafts and the identities of all of the representatives who were responsible.

==Aftermath==
Anger at the House banking scandal led Congress to create the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, a special joint House-Senate tasked with recommending reforms to the Legislative Branch. Resolutions to create the Joint Committee were introduced in summer 1991, but they did not gain traction until after the scandal. Congress created the Joint Committee in August 1992.

The scandal contributed to a perception of corruption and malfeasance and was a contributing factor to major changes in the House in which 77 Representatives resigned or were ousted by the 1994 elections.

<doc id="374816" wikidata="Q808483" url="?curid=374816" title="Barney Oldfield">
<text>Berna Eli &quot;Barney&quot; Oldfield (January 29, 1878 – October 4, 1946) was a pioneer American racing driver. His name was &quot;synonymous with speed in the first two decades of the 20th century&quot;. He was the winner of the inaugural AAA National Championship in 1905.

After success in bicycle racing, Oldfield began auto racing in 1902 and continued until his retirement in 1918. He was the first man to drive a car at 60 miles per hour (96 km/h) on a circular track.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Berna Eli Oldfield was born in York Township, Fulton County, Ohio, near Wauseon and Toledo, on January 29, 1878, to Henry Clay Oldfield, a laborer, and his wife Sarah. He was named after his father&#x27;s bunkmate in the 68th Ohio Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War. He had a sister Bertha.

As of the 1880 United States Census, the Oldfields lived in Wauseon. In 1889, they moved to Toledo, where the father, Henry, got a job at the state mental asylum. In the summer of 1891, Berna worked as a waterboy in order to purchase his first bicycle. According to legend, he spent most of his Sunday afternoons at the local Toledo fire station, hoping for the next call. As the company&#x27;s “mascot,” he was allowed to ride the big red hose wagon, pulled by a pair of horses that raced through the streets. The following year, Berna worked after school selling the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; and &quot;Toledo Bee&quot; newspapers.

Oldfield dropped out of school after the eighth grade in 1892. He started working with his father as a kitchen helper at the mental asylum during the day and a bellhop at the downtown hotel at night. He eventually worked at the hotel full-time, as he preferred it to working around mental patients. Purportedly the bell captain said that &quot;Berna” was &quot;a sissy name,&quot; so he changed it to “Barney.&quot; Oldfield was described as having a &quot;magnetic personality&quot;, and received many tips at the hotel. He used them to buy his first bike, an &quot;Advance Traveller&quot; with pneumatic tires.

=== Bicycle racer ===

Clarence Brigham, who sold the “Cleveland” brand bike, and Edward G. Eager (of Eager &amp; Green Mercantile) who sold the “Columbia” models in his store, organized the Wauseon Cycle Club in their town. They wanted both to increase bicycle sales and draw more people to the town via the Michigan Lake Shore Railroad. Other cycling groups in Swanton, Clyde, Monroe, Adrian, Blissfield, and Toledo were part of the same cycle racing circuit.

Bicyclists raced in half-mile and mile classes on public racetracks usually reserved for horse racing. Other members of the Club included Fred Ballmeyer, Ora Brailey, Curt and Buff Harrison, Doc Myers, Emil Winzeler, Doc Miley, Frank Harper, Dan Raymond (who fixed everyone&#x27;s bikes), Sid Black (a trick cyclist from Cleveland who later became president of the Packard Motor Company), and Barney Oldfield. In October 1892, the second “Silver Tournament” was held in Wauseon.

In 1893, Oldfield began working as an elevator operator at a different hotel. Every night he stored one hotel tenant&#x27;s lightweight &quot;Cleveland&quot; cycle in the basement; he sometimes &quot;borrowed it&quot;, riding it at night.

At age 16, Oldfield began serious bicycle racing in 1894 after officials from the &quot;Dauntless&quot; bicycle factory asked him to ride for the Ohio state championship. Although he came in second, the race was a turning point. Oldfield was hired as a parts sales representative for the Stearns bicycle factory. There he met Beatrice Lovetta Oatis, his future wife; they married in 1896.

By 1896, Oldfield was paid by Stearns, based in Syracuse, New York, to race on its amateur team.

=== Auto racer ===

Oldfield was loaned a gasoline-powered bicycle to race at Salt Lake City. Through fellow racer Tom Cooper, he met entrepreneur Henry Ford, who was at the beginning of his career as an auto manufacturer in Michigan. Ford had prepared two automobiles for racing, and he asked Oldfield if he would like to test one in Michigan. Oldfield agreed and traveled to Michigan for the trial, but neither car started. Although Oldfield had never driven an automobile, he and Cooper bought both test vehicles when Ford offered to sell them for $800. One was &quot;No. 999&quot;, which debuted in October 1902 at the Manufacturer&#x27;s Challenge Cup. Today it is displayed at the Henry Ford Museum in Greenfield Village, Michigan.

Oldfield agreed to drive against the current champion, Alexander Winton. Oldfield was rumored to have learned how to operate the controls of the &quot;999&quot; only the morning of the event. Oldfield won by a half mile in the five-mile (8 km) race. He slid through the corners like a motorcycle racer rather than braking. It was a great victory for Ford and resulted in both Oldfield and Ford becoming nationally known.

John Wilkinson, who designed an air-cooled engine for Franklin Automobile Company and was its chief engineer, raced against Oldfield in 1902. He won the state championship in a record time of 6:54:06.

On June 20, 1903, at the Indiana State Fairgrounds, Oldfield became the first driver to run a mile track in one minute flat, or . Two months later, he drove one mile in 55.8 seconds at the Empire City Race Track in Yonkers, New York.

Alexander Winton hired Oldfield as a professional driver and agreed to supply him with free cars for racing. Oldfield, his manager Ernest Moross, and his agent Will Pickens traveled throughout the United States in a series of timed runs and match races, and he earned a reputation as a showman, racing while holding a cigar in his mouth to cushion the spot where he had broken some molar teeth in a crash. Oldfield was &quot;the first American to become a celebrity solely for his ability to drive a car with great skill, speed, and daring.&quot; He liked to increase the drama in the best of three matches: he would win the first part by a nose, lose the second, and win the third. Oldfield won first place at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on August 21, 1909 in a Mercedes-Benz.

He bought a Benz, and raised his speed in 1910 to while driving his &quot;Blitzen Benz&quot;. Later in 1910, Oldfield reached the speed of . At Daytona Beach, Florida, on March 16, 1910, in his Blitzen Benz, he set the world speed record, driving 131.724 mph, for which he earned the nickname “speed king.”

=== Suspension and later career ===

Oldfield was suspended by the American Automobile Association (AAA) contest board for his &quot;outlaw&quot; racing, and was unable to race at sanctioned events for much of his career. He made his career by being paid to set speed records and conduct match races and exhibitions.

In 1914, his agent Will Pickens staged a &quot;Championship of the Universe&quot;, pitting Oldfield against another of his clients, aviator Lincoln Beachey. Oldfield raced his Fiat car against Beachey&#x27;s biplanes in at least 35 matches, barnstorming the country. In the more remote areas, they raced at county fair horse tracks. The Championship was &quot;extremely successful&quot;, and both Oldfield and Beachey earned more than $250,000 in their barnstorming.

After being reinstated by the AAA, Oldfield competed in the 1914 and 1916 Indianapolis 500, finishing fifth in each attempt. He was the first person to run a 100-mile-per-hour lap. His 1914 Indy finish was in an Indianapolis-built Stutz, and he was the highest-finishing driver in an American car in a race that was dominated by European brands.

Oldfield used the same car in his victory at the Los Angeles to Phoenix off-road race in November 1914. Oldfield also finished second in two major road races that year, the Vanderbilt Cup and the Corona 300. In 1915 he won the Venice, California 300 road race.

In November 1914, Oldfield won the Los Angeles-to-Phoenix Cactus Derby Race; the victor&#x27;s medal proclaimed him “Master Driver of the World”. On May 28, 1916, he became the first person to lap the Indianapolis Speedway at more than 100 mph in the front-wheel-drive &quot;Christie Racer&quot;, designed by John Walter Christie. He used the Blitzen Benz to break the existing mile, two-mile, and kilometer records at the Daytona Beach Road Course at Ormond, Florida. Afterward, he charged $4,000 for each of his appearances at driving races.

In June 1917, Oldfield used his Golden Submarine, designed with a roll bar to protect the driver, to beat fellow racing legend Ralph DePalma in a series of 10- to match races at Milwaukee.

He retired from racing in 1918 but continued to tour and make movies. In what was his last attempt at racing, in 1932 he tried to re-enter speed racing with a new car design, but was unable to find any financial sponsors.

Oldfield died on October 4, 1946, of a heart attack. He had married a total of four times. He was survived by Bessie Gooby Oldfield, whom he had divorced in 1924 and remarried in 1945, making her both his second and fourth wife. When they were first married, they adopted a daughter, Betty (who by his death was married to a Kelly). He was buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

== Beyond racing ==

=== Performances ===

Oldfield starred as himself for ten weeks in the Broadway musical &quot;The Vanderbilt Cup&quot; (1906).

He also appeared in movies, including the silent film &quot;Barney Oldfield&#x27;s Race for a Life&quot; (1913), where he raced against a train to rescue a heroine tied to the train tracks. He was also featured in &quot;The First Auto&quot; (1927) as an early pioneer of the automotive history. He was a technical advisor for the Vanderbilt Cup sequence in the feature film &quot;Back Street&quot; (1941). He starred as himself in a racing film titled &quot;Blonde Comet&quot;, the story of a young woman trying to achieve success as a racecar driver.

=== Racing safety ===

Bob Burman, one of Oldfield&#x27;s rivals and closest friends, was killed in a wreck during a race in Corona, California. Oldfield and Harry Arminius Miller, who developed and built carburetors and was one of the most famous engine builders, worked after that to design a racecar that was not only fast and durable but would protect the driver in the event of an accident. They built a racecar with a roll cage inside a streamlined driver&#x27;s compartment, which completely enclosed the driver, calling it the &quot;Golden Submarine.&quot;

=== Business ventures ===

Oldfield helped fellow racer Carl G. Fisher found the Fisher Automobile Company in Indianapolis. This is widely considered the first automobile dealership in the United States.

Oldfield also developed what was called the Oldfield tire for Firestone. In its slogan, Firestone touted that Oldfield had said, &quot;Firestone Tires are my only life insurance&quot;. In 1924, the Kimball Truck Co. of Los Angeles built the only 1924 Oldfield.

<text>A kart circuit is a race track designed for kart racing or other forms of short-length motor racing, such as small-scale motorcycle racing, pocketbike racing, or radio-controlled model racing. There are several types of kart circuit, depending on the type of use desired.

Unlike regular race tracks intended for auto racing or other forms of motorsports, kart circuits are usually much shorter in length, narrower, and contains numerous turns or corners.

==Circuit types==

===Short circuit===
A short circuit is defined as being an outdoor circuit of less than 1,500 meters in length 

The average length for a serious racing track for karts is around 1,100 - 1,200 meters, 7 to 9 meters in width. Normally custom-built for karting, they resemble road courses, with left and right turns. They generally allow sprint racing for both gearbox and non-gearbox karts.

Temporary circuits can be set in city streets or large parking lots for special events. This is the case for the Junior Monaco Kart Cup, a prestigious event for young drivers taking place each year in the city of Monaco, and the SKUSA SuperNationals, taking place in Las Vegas at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino.

===Long circuit===
A long circuit is defined as being an outdoor circuit of more than 1,500 m in length. Typically they are shared for other motorsport and only have gearbox kart races.

This type of event can see karts (Superkart) reach speeds in excess of 160 mph (250 km/h).

===Indoor===

Normally for casual racers, the indoor circuits can be in any closed space (often old factories), sometimes with a short outdoor section to add interest. Normally they have their own fleet of Go-karts or micro karts, chosen more for economy than out-and-out speed.

In Europe, indoor karting is where most people will sample their first time in a kart. Indoor karting exploded across the UK in the 1990s and had a similar impact in European countries such as France and Belgium. It has made a lesser impact in the United States. Indoor karting still offers a competitive experience for all levels of racers.

The world longest indoor circuit, the Highway Kart Racing GmbH, 1,600 meters, is located in Dortmund, Germany.

===Others===
In this category fall the dirt-tracks, oval tracks and ice rinks.

<doc id="374827" wikidata="Q1362457" url="?curid=374827" title="Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvray">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvray (; 12 June 1760 – 25 August 1797) was a French novelist, playwright and journalist.

==Life==

===Early life and literary works===
Louvet was born in Paris as the son of a stationer and became a bookseller&#x27;s clerk. He first attracted attention with the first part of his novel &quot;Les Amours du chevalier de Faublas&quot; (Paris, 1787; English translation illustrated by etchings by Louis Monzies in 1898), followed in 1788 by &quot;Six semaines de la vie du chevalier de Faublas&quot; and in 1790 by &quot;La Fin des amours du chevalier de Faublas&quot;. The heroine, Lodoiska, was based on the wife of a jeweller in the Palais Royal, with whom Louvet had an affair. She divorced her husband in 1792 and married Louvet in 1793. His second novel, &quot;Émilie de Varmont&quot; (1791), was intended to prove the utility and necessity of divorce and of the marriage of priests, questions raised by the French Revolution; all his works tended to advocate revolutionary ideals.

He attempted to have one of his unpublished plays, &quot;L&#x27;Anoblié conspirateur&quot;, performed at the Comédie-Française, and records that one of its managers, d&#x27;Orfeuil, listened to the reading of the first three acts impatiently, exclaiming at last: &quot;I should need cannon in order to put that piece on the stage&quot;. A sort of farce at the expense of the army of the Royalist &quot;émigrés&quot;, &quot;La Grande Revue des armes noire et blanche&quot;, had, however, better success: it was on stage for twenty-five nights.

===Early activism===
Louvet was first brought into notice as a politician by his &quot;Paris justifié&quot;, in reply to a truly incendiary pamphlet in which Jean Joseph Mounier, after the removal of King Louis XVI from the Palace of Versailles to Paris in October 1789, had attacked the capital (which was still relatively peaceful), and argued that the court should be established elsewhere. This led to Louvet&#x27;s election to the Jacobin Club, for which, as he wrote bitterly in his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, the qualifications were then a genuine &quot;civisme&quot; and some talent.

A self-styled &quot;philosophe&quot; and radical revolutionary, Louvet subsequently campaigned against despotism and reaction, which he identified with the moderate constitutional monarchy advocated by the Marquis de la Fayette, the Abbé Maury, and other disciples of Niccolò Machiavelli.

===Deputy and Girondist===
On 25 December 1791 he presented at the tribune of the Legislative Assembly his &quot;Petition contre les princes&quot;, which would have major influence during the First French Empire. Elected deputy to the Assembly for the &quot;département&quot; of Loiret, he gave his first speech in January 1792.

He attached himself to the Girondists, whose vague deism, sentimental humanitarianism and ardent republicanism he fully shared, and from March to November 1792 he published, at Jean Marie Roland&#x27;s expense, a bi-weekly &quot;journal-affiche&quot;, of which the title, &quot;La Sentinelle&quot;, proclaimed its mission to open all of Europe to the Enlightenment at a time when, after the Habsburg declaration of war on France and the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, a schism between the king and his subjects had become obvious.

On 10 August (the effective fall of the Monarchy), Louvet became editor of the &quot;Journal des Débats&quot; and, both as a journalist and deputy in the National Convention, made himself conspicuous by his attacks on Maximilien Robespierre, Jean-Paul Marat and the other Montagnards, whom he later claimed he would have succeeded in bringing to justice after the September Massacres were it not for the poor support he received from the Girondist leaders. On 29 October he accused Robespierre of creating a personality cult, governing the Paris &quot;Conseil General&quot; and paying the &quot;Septembriseurs&quot;.
R. Scurr considered that Robespierre was taken by surprise by the accusations while the writer of the Brittanica article on Louvet considered Louvet&#x27;s words along with his claims that Robespierre was a “royalist,” Marat “the principal agent of England,” the Montagnards Orleanists in masquerade to have beenn &quot;ill-balanced invective contributed to their [the Girondist leaders] ruin and his own&quot;. Robespierre had to be defended by Danton. Commenting on the control that Robespierre ensured in Paris 1792 French National Convention election in which many candidates were disqualified Louvet said &quot;Almost always at the moment despotism is overthrown agitateurs appear formenting anarchy to oppress and tyranize in their turn&quot;.

His courageous attitude at the king&#x27;s trial, when he supported the appeal to the people over the outright death penalty, added to hostility towards his party. Nonetheless, he defended the Girondists to the last moment, displaying an incriminating courage. After the crisis of 31 May 1793, when François Hanriot and the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; stormed the Convention, he joined his defeated faction in their flight from Paris. His wife Lodoiska, who had actively cooperated in his campaigns, was also placed in danger by the developments.

===Thermidor and directory===
After the onset of the Thermidorian Reaction and the fall of Robespierre (27 July 1794), he was recalled to the Convention, when he was instrumental in bringing Jean-Baptiste Carrier and the others responsible for the drownings at Nantes to justice. His influence became considerable: he was elected a member of the Committee of the Constitution, president of the Assembly, and member of the Committee of Public Safety, against the overgrown power with which he in earlier days protested against.

His conflict with the Montagnards had not made him reactionary: he attacked the &quot;Jeunesse dorée&quot;, and was regarded by many as a pillar of Jacobinism. &quot;La Sentinelle&quot; reappeared, under his auspices, preaching union among republicans. Under the Directory (1795) he was elected a member of the Council of Five Hundred, of which he was secretary, and also a member of the Institut de France.

Meanwhile, he had returned to his trade and set up a bookseller&#x27;s shop in the Palais Royal. But, in spite of the fact that he had once more denounced the Jacobins in &quot;La Sentinelle&quot;, he had come to be seen as a major enemy by the &quot;Jeunesse dorée&quot;. His shop was attacked by the young men with cries of &quot;À bas la Loupe, à bas la belle Ledoiska, à bas les gardes du corps de Louvet!&quot; (&quot;Down with the She-Wolf, down with beautiful Ledoiska, down with Louvet&#x27;s bodyguards!&quot;); he and his wife were insulted in the streets and the theatres: &quot;À bas les Louvets et les Louvetants!&quot; (&quot;Down with the Louvets and the Louvetants!&quot; - a reference to his guards, based on the antiquated senses of the verb &quot;louveter&quot;), and he was forced to leave Paris. The Directory appointed him to the consulship at Palermo, in the Kingdom of Naples, but he died before taking up his post.

==Louvet&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;==
In 1795 Louvet published a portion of his &quot;Memoirs&quot; under the title of &quot;Quelques notices pour l&#x27;histoire et le récit de mes perils depuis le 31 mai 1793&quot;. They were mainly written in the various hiding-places in which Louvet took refuge, and they give a vivid picture of the sufferings of the exiled Girondists. They form a major document for the study of the psychology of the Revolution, as they give insight into the Louvet&#x27;s own states of mind and political choices. The first complete edition of the &quot;Mémoires de Louvet de Couvray&quot;, edited with preface, notes and tables, by François Victor Alphonse Aulard, were published in Paris in 1889.

<text>The Australia national cricket team represents Australia in men&#x27;s international cricket. Along with England, it is the joint oldest team in Test cricket history, playing and winning the first ever Test match in 1877; the team also plays One-Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket, participating in both the first ODI, against England in the 1970–71 season and the first T20I, against New Zealand in the 2004–05 season, winning both games. The team draws its players from teams playing in the Australian domestic competitions – the Sheffield Shield, the Australian domestic limited-overs cricket tournament and the Big Bash League. Australia are the current ICC World Test Championship and ICC Cricket World Cup champions. They are regarded as the most successful national team in the history of cricket.

The national team has played 873 Test matches, winning 419, losing 233, 219 drawn and with 2 tied , Australia is first in the ICC Test Rankings. Australia is the most successful team in Test cricket history, in terms of overall wins, win–loss ratio, and wins percentage. Australia have won the ICC World Test Championship once, defeating India in the final of the 2021–2023 World Test Championship.

Test rivalries centre on The Ashes (with England), the Border–Gavaskar Trophy (with India), the Frank Worrell Trophy (with the West Indies), the Trans-Tasman Trophy (with New Zealand), and matches against South Africa.

The team has played 1,012 ODI matches, winning 614, losing 354, tying 9 and with 35 ending in a no-result. , Australia is ranked second in the ICC Men&#x27;s ODI Team Rankings. Australia is one of the most successful teams in ODI cricket history, winning more than 60 per cent of their matches, with a record eight World Cup final appearances (1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015, and 2023) and have won the World Cup a record six times: 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015, and 2023. Australia is the first (and only) team to appear in four consecutive World Cup finals (1996, 1999, 2003, and 2007), surpassing the old record of three consecutive World Cup appearances by the West Indies (1975, 1979, and 1983) and the first and only team to win 3 consecutive World Cups (1999, 2003, and 2007). The team was undefeated in 34 consecutive World Cup matches until the 2011 Cricket World Cup where Pakistan beat them by 4 wickets in the Group stage. Australia is also the second team to win a World Cup (2015) on home soil, after India (2011). Australia have also won the ICC Champions Trophy twice (2006 and 2009) making them the first and the only team to be back to back winners in the Champions Trophy tournaments.

Australia has played 203 Twenty20 International matches, winning 112, losing 84, tying 3, and with 4 ending in a no-result. , Australia is ranked second in the ICC Men&#x27;s T20I Team Rankings. Australia have won the ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup once, defeating New Zealand in the 2021 Final.

On 12 January 2019, Australia won an ODI against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 34 runs, to record their 1,000th win in international cricket.

Australia are the reigning World Test Champions and World Cup Champions, winning both titles in 2023 against India, the former at The Oval in London and the latter at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.

==History==
===Early history===
The Australian cricket team participated in the first Test match at the MCG in 1877. They defeated England by 45 runs, with Charles Bannerman making the first Test century with a score of 165. Test cricket, which only occurred between Australia and England at the time, was limited by the long distance between the two countries, which took several months by sea. Despite Australia&#x27;s much smaller population, the team was very competitive in early games, producing stars such as Jack Blackham, Billy Murdoch, Fred &quot;The Demon&quot; Spofforth, George Bonnor, Percy McDonnell, George Giffen, and Charles &quot;The Terror&quot; Turner. Most cricketers at the time were either from New South Wales or Victoria, with the notable exception of George Giffen, the star South Australian all-rounder.

One of the highlights of Australia&#x27;s early history was the 1882 Test match against England, which took place at The Oval. In this match, Fred Spofforth took 7/44 in the game&#x27;s fourth innings, saving the match by preventing England from making their 85-run target.

After this match, &quot;The Sporting Times&quot;, a major newspaper in London at the time, printed a mock obituary in which the death of English cricket was proclaimed and the announcement made that &quot;the body was cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.” This was the start of the famous Ashes series, in which Australia and England play a series of Test matches to decide the holder of the Ashes. To this day, the contest is one of the fiercest rivalries in sport.

===Golden age===
The &#x27;Golden Age&#x27; of Australian Test cricket occurred around the end of the 19th century, concluding at the beginning of the 20th century, with the team under the captaincy of Joe Darling, Monty Noble and Clem Hill, winning eight of ten tours. It is considered to have lasted from the 1897–98 English tour of Australia and the 1910–11 South African tour of Australia. Outstanding batsmen such as Joe Darling, Clem Hill, and Reggie Duff, all helped Australia to become the dominant cricketing nation for most of this period.

Victor Trumper became one of Australia&#x27;s first sporting heroes, who was widely considered Australia&#x27;s greatest batsman before Bradman became one of the most popular players. He played a record (at the time) of a number of Tests at 49, and scored 3163 runs at a high for the time average of 39.04. He died in 1915 at the age of 37 from kidney disease, causing national mourning. The &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, in its obituary for him, called him Australia&#x27;s greatest batsman: &quot;Of all the great Australian batsmen Victor Trumper was by general consent the best and most brilliant.&quot; The years leading up to the start of World War were marred by conflict between the players, led by Clem Hill, Victor Trumper and Frank Laver, and the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket, led by Peter McAlister, who was attempting to gain more control of tours from the players.

This led to six leading players (the so-called &quot;Big Six&quot;) walking out on the 1912 Triangular Tournament in England, with Australia fielding what was generally considered a second-rate side. This was the last series before the war, and no more cricket was played by Australia for eight years. Fast bowler Tibby Cotter, who had caused outrage with his bowling during the 1905 tour of England, after first striking W.G. Grace with the ball, before dismissing him the following delivery, was killed during the Battle of Beersheba.

===Inter-war period===

Test cricket resumed in the 1920/21 season in Australia with a touring English team captained by Johnny Douglas losing all five Tests to Australia, captained by the &quot;Big Ship&quot; Warwick Armstrong. Several players from before the war, including Warwick Armstrong, Charlie Macartney, Charles Kelleway, Warren Bardsley and the wicket-keeper Sammy Carter, were instrumental in the team&#x27;s success, as well as new players Herbie Collins, Jack Ryder, Bert Oldfield, the spinner Arthur Mailey and the so-called &quot;twin destroyers&quot; Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald. The team continued its success on the 1921 tour of England, winning three out of the five Tests in Warwick Armstrong&#x27;s last series. The side was, on the whole, inconsistent in the latter half of the 1920s, losing its first home Ashes series since the 1911–12 season in 1928–29.

===Bradman era===

The 1930 tour of England heralded a new age of success for the Australian team. The team, led by Bill Woodfull – the &quot;Great Un-bowlable&quot; – featured legends of the game including Bill Ponsford, Stan McCabe, Clarrie Grimmett and the young pair of Archie Jackson and Don Bradman. Bradman was the outstanding batsman of the series, scoring a record 974 runs, including one century, two double centuries and one triple century, a massive score of 334 at Leeds which including 309 runs in a day. Jackson died of tuberculosis at the age of 23 three years later, after playing eight Tests. The team was widely considered unstoppable, winning nine of its next ten Tests.

The 1932–33 England tour of Australia is considered one of the most infamous episodes of cricket, due to the England team&#x27;s use of bodyline, where captain Douglas Jardine instructed his bowlers Bill Voce and Harold Larwood to bowl fast, short-pitched deliveries aimed at the bodies of the Australian batsmen. The tactic, although effective, was widely considered by Australian crowds as vicious and unsporting. Injuries to Bill Woodfull, who was struck over the heart, and Bert Oldfield, who received a fractured skull (although from a non-bodyline ball), exacerbated the situation, almost causing a full-scale riot from the 50 000 fans at the Adelaide Oval for the third Test. The conflict almost escalated into a diplomatic incident between the two countries, as leading Australian political figures, including the Governor of South Australia, Alexander Hore-Ruthven, protested to their English counterparts. The series ended in a 4–1 win for England but the bodyline tactics used were banned the year after.

The Australian team put the result of this series behind them, winning their next tour of England in 1934. The team was led by Bill Woodfull on his final tour and was notably dominated by Ponsford and Bradman, who twice put on partnerships of over 380 runs, with Bradman once again scoring a triple century at Leeds. The bowling was dominated by the spin pair of Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett, who took 53 wickets between them, with O&#x27;Reilly twice taking seven-wicket hauls.

Sir Donald Bradman is widely considered the greatest player of all time. He dominated the sport from 1930 until his retirement in 1948, setting new records for the highest score in a Test innings (334 vs England at Headingley in 1930), the most runs (6996), the most centuries (29), the most double centuries and the highest Test and first-class batting averages. His record for the highest Test batting average – 99.94 – has never been beaten. It is almost 40 runs per innings above the next highest average. He would have finished with an average of over 100 runs per innings if he had not been dismissed for a duck in his last Test. He was knighted in 1949 for services to cricket. He is generally considered one of Australia&#x27;s all-time greatest sporting heroes, if not the greatest.

Test cricket was again interrupted by war, with the last Test series in 1938 made notable by Len Hutton scoring a world record 364 for England, and with Chuck Fleetwood-Smith conceding 298 runs in England&#x27;s world record total of 7/903. Ross Gregory, a notable young batsman who played two Tests before the war, was killed in the war.

===Post-war era===

The team continued its success after the end of the Second World War with the first Test (also Australia&#x27;s first against New Zealand) being played in the 1945–46 season against New Zealand. Australia was by far the most successful team of the 1940s, being undefeated throughout the decade, winning two Ashes series against England and its first Test series against India. The team capitalised on its ageing stars Bradman, Sid Barnes, Bill Brown and Lindsay Hassett while new talent, including Ian Johnson, Don Tallon, Arthur Morris, Neil Harvey, Bill Johnston and the fast bowling pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, who all made their debut in the latter half of the 1940s, and were to form the basis of the team for a good part of the next decade. The team that Don Bradman led to England in 1948 gained the moniker &quot;The Invincibles&quot;, after going through the tour without losing a single game. Of 31 first-class games played during the tour, they won 23 and drew 8, including winning the five-match Test series 4–0 with one draw. The tour was particularly notable for the fourth Test of the series, in which Australia won by seven wickets chasing a target of 404, setting a new record for the highest run chase in Test cricket, with Arthur Morris and Bradman both scoring centuries, as well as for the final Test in the series, Bradman&#x27;s last, where he finished with a duck in his last innings after needing only four runs to secure a career average of 100.

Australia was less successful in the 1950s, losing three consecutive Ashes series to England, including a horrendous 1956 Tour of England, where the &#x27;spin twins&#x27; Laker and Lock destroyed Australia, taking 61 wickets between them, including Laker taking 19 wickets in the game (a first-class record) at Headingley, a game dubbed Laker&#x27;s Match.

However, the team rebounded to win five consecutive series in the latter half of the 1950s, first under the leadership of Ian Johnson, then Ian Craig and Richie Benaud. The series against the West Indies in the 1960–61 season was notable for the Tied Test in the first game at the Gabba, which was the first in Test cricket. Australia ended up winning the series 2–1 after a hard-fought series that was praised for its excellent standards and sense of fair play. Stand-out players in that series as well as through the early part of the 1960s were Richie Benaud, who took a then-record number of wickets as a leg-spinner and who also captained Australia in 28 Tests, including 24 without defeat;Alan Davidson, who was a notable fast-bowler and also became the first player to take 10 wickets and make 100 runs in the same game in the first Test; Bob Simpson, who also later captained Australia for two different periods of time; Colin McDonald, the first-choice opening batsman for most of the 1950s and early &#x27;60s; Norm O&#x27;Neill, who made 181 in the Tied Test;Neil Harvey, towards the end of his long career; and Wally Grout, an excellent wicket-keeper who died at the age of 41.

===World Series Cricket and Restructuring===
The Centenary Test was played in March 1977 at the MCG to celebrate 100 years since the first Test was played. Australia won the match by 45 runs, an identical result to the first Test match.

In May 1977, Kerry Packer announced he was organising a breakaway competition – World Series Cricket (WSC) – after the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) refused to accept Channel Nine&#x27;s bid to gain exclusive television rights to Australia&#x27;s Test matches in 1976. Packer secretly signed leading international cricketers to his competition, including 28 Australians. Almost all of the Australian Test team at the time were signed to WSC – notable exceptions including Gary Cosier, Geoff Dymock, Kim Hughes and Craig Serjeant – and the Australian selectors were forced to pick what was generally considered a third-rate team from players in the Sheffield Shield. Former player Bob Simpson, who had retired 10 years previously after a conflict with the board, was recalled at the age of 41 to captain Australia against India. Jeff Thomson was named deputy in a team that included seven debutants. Australia managed to win the series 3–2, mainly thanks to the batting of Simpson, who scored 539 runs, including two centuries; and the bowling of Wayne Clark, who took 28 wickets. Australia lost the next series 3–1 against the West Indies, which was fielding a full strength team; and also lost the 1978–79 Ashes series 5–1, the team&#x27;s worst Ashes result in Australia. Graham Yallop was named as captain for the Ashes, with Kim Hughes taking over for the 1979–80 tour of India. Rodney Hogg took 41 wickets in his debut series, an Australian record. WSC players returned to the team for the 1979–80 season after a settlement between the ACB and Kerry Packer. Greg Chappell was reinstated as captain.

The underarm bowling incident of 1981 occurred when, in an ODI against New Zealand, Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor to bowl an underarm delivery to New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie with New Zealand needing a six to tie off the last ball. The aftermath of the incident soured political relations between Australia and New Zealand, with several leading political and cricketing figures calling it &quot;unsportsmanlike&quot; and &quot;not in the spirit of cricket&quot;.

Australia continued its success up until the early 1980s, built around the Chappell brothers, Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson and Rod Marsh. The 1980s was a period of relative mediocrity after the turmoil caused by the Rebel Tours of South Africa and the subsequent retirement of several key players. The rebel tours were funded by the South African Cricket Board to compete against its national side, which had been banned—along with many other sports, including Olympic athletes—from competing internationally, due to the South African government&#x27;s racist apartheid policies. Some of Australia&#x27;s best players were poached: Graham Yallop, Carl Rackemann, Terry Alderman, Rodney Hogg, Kim Hughes, John Dyson, Greg Shipperd, Steve Rixon and Steve Smith amongst others. These players were handed three-year suspensions by the Australian Cricket Board which greatly weakened the player pool for the national sides, as most were either current representative players or on the verge of gaining honours.

===Golden era===
The so-called &#x27;Golden Era&#x27; of Australian cricket occurred around the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. This was a period in which Australian cricket recovered from the disruption caused by World Series Cricket to create arguably the strongest Test team in history.

Under the captaincy of Allan Border and the new fielding standards put in place by new coach Bob Simpson, the team was restructured and gradually rebuilt their cricketing stocks. Some of the rebel players returned to the national side after serving their suspensions, including Trevor Hohns, Carl Rackemann and Terry Alderman. During these lean years, it was the batsmen Border, David Boon, Dean Jones, the young Steve Waugh and the bowling feats of Alderman, Bruce Reid, Craig McDermott, Merv Hughes and to a lesser extent, Geoff Lawson who kept the Australian side afloat.

With the emergence of players such as Ian Healy, Mark Taylor, Geoff Marsh, Mark Waugh, and Greg Matthews in the late 1980s, Australia was on the way back from the doldrums. They went on to win their first ever world title by getting the better of England in the 1987 Cricket World Cup final.Winning the Ashes in 1989, the Australians got a roll on beating Pakistan, Sri Lanka and then followed it up with another Ashes win on home soil in 1991. The Australians went on to the West Indies and had their chances but ended up losing the series. However, they bounced back and beat the Indians in their next Test series; with the retirement of the champion but defensive Allan Border, a new era of attacking cricket had begun under the leadership of firstly Mark Taylor and then Steve Waugh. Australia ended the 20th century by winning the 1999 Cricket World Cup. They defeated Pakistan in the final.

===21st century===

The 1990s and early 21st century were arguably Australia&#x27;s most successful periods, unbeaten in all Ashes series played bar the famous 2005 series and achieving a hat-trick of World Cups.This success has been attributed to the restructuring of the team and system by Border, successive aggressive captains, and the effectiveness of several key players, most notably Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne, Justin Langer, Matthew Hayden, Steve Waugh, Adam Gilchrist, Michael Hussey and Ricky Ponting.

Following the 2006–07 Ashes series which Australia won 5–0, Australia slipped in the rankings after the retirements of key players. In the 2013/14 Ashes series, Australia again defeated England 5–0 and climbed back to third in the ICC International Test rankings. In February/March 2014, Australia beat South Africa, the number one team in the world, 2–1 and overtook them to return to the top of the rankings. In 2015, Australia won the Cricket World Cup, losing just one game for the tournament.

==== 2018 ball-tampering incident ====

On 25 March 2018, during the third Test match against hosts South Africa; players Cameron Bancroft, Steve Smith, David Warner and the leadership group of the team were implicated in a ball tampering scandal. Smith and Bancroft admitted to conspiring to alter the condition of the ball by rubbing it with a piece of adhesive tape containing abrasive granules picked up from the ground (it was later revealed that sandpaper was used). Smith stated that the purpose was to gain an advantage by unlawfully changing the ball&#x27;s surface in order to generate reverse swing. Bancroft had been filmed tampering with the ball and, after being informed he had been caught, he was seen to transfer a yellow object from a pocket to the inside front of his trousers to hide the evidence. Steve Smith and David Warner were stood down as captain and vice-captain during the third Test while head coach, Darren Lehmann was suspected to have assisted Cameron Bancroft to tamper the ball. The ICC imposed a one-match ban and 100%-match-fee fine on Smith, while Bancroft was fined 75 percent of his match fee and received 3 demerit points.
Smith and Warner were both stripped of their captaincy roles by Cricket Australia and sent home from the tour (along with Bancroft). Tim Paine was appointed as captain for the fourth Test. Cricket Australia then suspended Smith and Warner from playing for 12 months and Bancroft for 9 months. Smith and Bancroft could not be considered for leadership roles for 12 months after the suspension, while Warner is banned from leadership of any Cricket Australia team for life. In the aftermath of these events, Darren Lehmann announced his resignation as head coach at the end of the series, with Justin Langer replacing him. On 8 May 2018, Tim Paine was also named as the ODI captain while Aaron Finch was reinstated as T20I captain hours later, although Finch replaced Paine as the ODI captain after the 5–0 ODI series whitewash in England in June 2018.

==== October 2018–present ====
On 7 October 2018, Australia played their first Test match under new coach Justin Langer and a new leadership group, which included Tim Paine as Australia&#x27;s 46th Test captain. After a 1–0 loss to Pakistan in a two match Test series against Pakistan in the UAE and a 2–1 defeat against India in a four match Test series, they found success against Sri Lanka, winning the two Test match series 2–0. In 2019, Australia played in the Cricket World Cup, where they finished second in the group stage before being knocked out by England at Edgbaston in the semi-final. Australia later went on to retain the Ashes during the 2019 Ashes series, the first time on English soil since 2001, by winning the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

In 2020–21, Australia hosted India for 3 ODIs, 3 T20Is, and 4 Tests. They won the ODI series 2–1, but lost the T20I series 2–1. Then, the two teams competed for the Border–Gavaskar Trophy which saw one of the greatest overseas Test triumphs by India in the 4th Test to win the series 2–1, with the 3rd Test being drawn. In 2021, Australia named a 15-member squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup with regular limited overs captain Aaron Finch leading the side. In finals, they would face their trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand and win the match to claim their maiden T20 World Cup Trophy.

On 19 November 2021, Tim Paine resigned from the captaincy due to off-the-field misconduct, and was replaced by Pat Cummins, who became Australia&#x27;s 47th Test captain, with Steve Smith named as his deputy. Under Pat Cummins, Australia retained 2021–22 Ashes at home by winning the series 4–0. Australia then toured Pakistan in March 2022 for the first time since 1998 to play 3 test matches and 3 ODIs and one-off T20. Australia won all the series. Australia failed to advance to knockouts in 2022 T20 World Cup. Australia&#x27;s white ball captain Finch retired from international cricket. Afterwards, Pat Cummins was made ODI captain.

2023 was a memorable year for Australia where they won their maiden ICC World Test Championship title (which made them the first team in history to win all major ICC Trophies across all formats), and retained the Ashes. In November, they won the World Cup for the 6th time, defeating the host India in the final.

==International grounds==

Australia currently plays International cricket at each of the following grounds:

==Team colours==
For Test matches, the team wears cricket whites, with an optional sweater or sweater-vest, with a green and gold V-neck for use in cold weather. The sponsor&#x27;s (currently Toyota for home matches and Qantas for away matches) logo is displayed on the right side of the chest while the Cricket Australia emblem is displayed on the left. If the sweater is being worn the Cricket Australia emblem is displayed under the V-neck and the sponsor&#x27;s logo is again displayed on the right side of the chest. The baggy green, the Australian Test cricket cap, is considered an essential part of the cricketing uniform and as a symbol of the national team, with new players being presented with one upon their selection in the team. The cap and the helmet both prominently display the Australian cricketing coat-of-arms instead of the Cricket Australia emblem. At the end of 2011, ASICS was named the manufacturer of the whites and limited over uniforms from Adidas, with the ASICS logo being displayed on the shirt and pants. Players may choose any manufacturer for their other gear (bat, pads, shoes, gloves, etc.).

In One Day International (ODI) cricket and Twenty20 International cricket, the team wears uniforms usually coloured green and gold, the national colours of Australia. There has been a variety of different styles and layouts used in both forms of the limited-overs game, with coloured clothing (sometimes known as &quot;pyjamas&quot;) being introduced for World Series Cricket in the late 1970s. The Toyota or Qantas logo is prominently displayed on the shirts and other gears. The current T20I kit consists of green as the primary colour and gold as the secondary colour. The ODI is the opposite of the T20I kit, with gold as the primary colour and green as the secondary colour. However, since Australia beat New Zealand at the MCG in the 2015 Cricket World Cup wearing the gold uniform, it has also become their primary colour, with the hats used being called &#x27;floppy gold&#x27;, formerly known as &#x27;baggy gold&#x27;, a limited-overs equivalent to a baggy green. Until the early 2000s and briefly in early 2020, in ODIs, Australia wore yellow helmets, before using green helmets as in test matches.

Former suppliers were Asics (1999), ISC (2000–2001), Fila (2002–2003) and Adidas (2004–2010) among others. Before Travelex (and 3 in test matches), some of the former sponsors were XXXX (1990–1992), Coca-Cola (1993–1998), Fly Emirates (1999) and Carlton &amp; United Breweries (2000–2001).
==Squad==
Cricket Australia released the list of their 2024–2025 national contracts on 28 March 2024. Players can still be upgraded to national contracts throughout the year by receiving 12 upgrade points. A Test is worth five points, while each ODI and T20 international is worth two.

This is a list of every active player who is contracted to Cricket Australia, has played for Australia since February 2024 or was named in the current Test, ODI or T20I squad. Uncapped players are listed in &quot;italics&quot;.

==Traditions==
===Under the Southern Cross I Stand===

The team song is &quot;Under the Southern Cross I Stand&quot;, which is sung by the players after every victory and &quot;treated with reverential consideration and respect&quot; within the team. The official lyrics are as follows, though when it is sung by the players, the word &quot;little&quot; in the last line is instead replaced by &quot;bloody&quot; or the expletive &quot;fucking&quot;.

:&quot;Under the Southern Cross I Stand&quot;
:&quot;A sprig of wattle in my hand,&quot;
:&quot;A native of my native land,&quot;
:&quot;Australia you little beauty.&quot;

The authorship of this &quot;Under the Southern Cross I Stand&quot; is credited to former wicketkeeper Rod Marsh, who was apparently inspired by Henry Lawson&#x27;s 1887 poem, &quot;Flag of the Southern Cross&quot;. Marsh initially had the role of leading the team in singing it and, on his retirement, passed it on to Allan Border. The other players to have taken on the role are David Boon (when Border took over the captaincy), Ian Healy (on Boon&#x27;s retirement), Ricky Ponting (on Healy&#x27;s retirement), Justin Langer (when Ponting took over the captaincy), Michael Hussey (on Langer&#x27;s retirement), Nathan Lyon (on Hussey&#x27;s retirement). With Nathan Lyon&#x27;s departure from the team due to injury after the Second Ashes Test at Lord&#x27;s in 2023 , custody of the song has passed to wicketkeeper Alex Carey.

===Nerds and Julios===

Since the 1990s, team members have identified themselves or their teammates as either &quot;nerds&quot; or &quot;Julios&quot;. The &quot;nerds&quot; have cheap haircuts, are polite off-field, and let their playing performance define them. The Julios have fashionable hairstyles and wear snappy clothes. The term &quot;Julio&quot; is reported to refer to Spanish singer Julio Iglesias. In a 2016 podcast, Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood wrote that the &quot;nerds&quot; tended to be fast bowlers, and gave himself as an example.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Glaziers and Painters of Glass is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The Guild of Glaziers, or makers of Glass, the company&#x27;s forerunner, existed as early as the fourteenth century. It received a royal charter of incorporation in 1638. It is no longer a trade association of glass craftsmen, instead existing, along with a majority of livery companies, as a charitable body.

The original Glaziers Hall was burnt down during the Great Fire of London in 1666. The current Hall was acquired and refurbished in 1977. It is located on the south side of London Bridge on Montague Close in the London Borough of Southwark and has views over the River Thames towards the City of London.

The company ranks fifty-third in the order of precedence for livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Lucem Tuam Da Nobis O Deus&quot;, Latin for &quot;O God, Give Us Your Light&quot;.

The charitable activities of the Glaziers’ Company are mainly, but not exclusively, focused on stained glass, and are managed by the Glaziers&#x27; Foundation, a registered Charity, No 1143700. The foundation has four committees that were previously self-standing charities: the Glaziers&#x27; Trust, the London Stained Glass Repository, the Charity for Relief in Need and the Cutter Trust.
The Glaziers’ Trust has the largest budget and has three principal objects: assisting with the restoration and conservation of historic and important stained glass, supporting the education and training of glass artists and conservators and fostering public information and awareness. The board of the trust sits four times a year to consider applications for stained glass conservation and restoration grants. To maintain the highest professional standards it is a condition of grant that remedial work is carried out by an accredited glazier or glass conservator.

The trust is usually unable to fund the cost of an entire restoration project and normally provides only partial funding. However, such is the depth of knowledge and experience on the board that its approval for a project, even if it results in only a modest award, is regularly used by applicants to help raise funds from other organisations.

The trust also supports other organisations within the stained glass community such as the British Society of Master Glass Painters and the Stained Glass Museum in Ely, Cambridgeshire. Both of these receive an annual grant to help them continue their work. The trust also supports the much-respected publication, “Vidimus”, the only online journal devoted to stained glass.

Through the foundation&#x27;s Craft and Competitions Committee, the trust funds several educational initiatives such as the Stevens Competition. This is a nationwide competition for architectural glass design and we believe it to be the only national competition of its kind. It attracts entries from young artists, which are judged by a panel of prominent craftsmen. Sponsors of the competition regularly commission work from among the entries and the careers of many young artists have been launched by participation in the competition.

The Award for Excellence and the Ashton Hill Awards provide opportunities for those wishing to pursue a practical career in stained glass. They provide the funds for placements in working studios where mentored and supervised work experience takes place. The Award for Excellence provides 40 weeks of placements and the Ashton Hill Awards 10 weeks. The Arthur and Helen Davis Travelling Scholarships provide opportunities for the study of glass outside the UK. Recent awardees have studied in the United States, Iceland, France, Germany and the Czech Republic.

Continuing Professional Development Awards are available for practitioners wishing to broaden their skills either artistically or by attaining accredited conservator status.

The London Stained Glass Repository (LSGR) rescues and relocates good quality stained glass, principally from redundant churches. In addition to building closure, glass may need to be rescued and protected from the threat of vandalism. Rescued glass is available free of charge for installation in any suitable building to which the public has access.

Once vulnerable glass has been identified the Management Committee of the LSGR assesses its artistic merit, state of repair and general condition. When this work has been done negotiations for the release and storage of the glass begin. Once in store, the glass is photographed, catalogued and all relevant information recorded. Only then can a new home be sought with most of the glass going to religious buildings. The LSGR does not limit its activities to the UK, and glass has been relocated in the United States, Australia, the Falkland Islands, and Croatia. Glass can be lent to museums or included in educational projects at home and abroad.

The company awards grants to churches and other public buildings for restoring and conserving stained glass.

<text>Crowsnest Pass (sometimes referred to as Crow&#x27;s Nest Pass, ) is a low mountain pass across the Continental Divide of the Canadian Rockies on the Alberta–British Columbia border.

==Geography==
The pass is located in southeast British Columbia and southwest Alberta, and is the southernmost rail and highway route through the Canadian Rockies. It is the lowest-elevation mountain pass in Canada south of the Yellowhead Pass (); the other major passes, which are higher, being Kicking Horse Pass (), Howse Pass () and Vermilion Pass ().

Crowsnest Pass comprises a valley running east–west through Crowsnest Ridge. On the Alberta side, the Crowsnest River flows east from Crowsnest Lake, eventually draining into the Oldman River and ultimately reaching Hudson Bay via the Nelson River. Summit Lake on the British Columbia side drains via three intermediary creeks into the Elk River, which feeds into the Kootenay River, and finally into the Columbia River to the Pacific.

==Transportation==
Before the arrival of Europeans, Indigenous people used this major breach through the Front Ranges for seasonal migrations, and also for trade between mountain and plains cultures.

The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) built the Crowsnest Route line from Lethbridge, Alberta, to Kootenay Landing, British Columbia, through the Crowsnest Pass between 1897 and 1898. This line was built primarily to access mineral-rich southeastern BC via an all-Canadian rail route, and to assert Canadian (and CPR) sovereignty in an area that U.S. railroads were beginning to build into. It also opened up coal deposits in the Crowsnest and Elk River valleys, which were important to mineral smelting operations and assisted the CPR in its conversion of locomotives from wood to coal. The CPR sought and received construction funding from the federal government, partially in exchange for a freight subsidy on prairie farm exports and equipment imports which came to be called the &quot;Crow&#x27;s Nest Pass Agreement&quot;.

&quot;The Crow Rate&quot;, as the subsidy agreement came to be referred to, was eventually extended from CPR&#x27;s Crowsnest Pass railway line to apply to all railway lines in western Canada, regardless of corporate ownership or geography, creating artificially low freight rates for grain shipments through the Great Lakes ports. The rate also correspondingly limited industrial growth in the western provinces as it was cheaper to produce items in eastern Canada and ship them west under the Crow Rate. This subsidy was finally abolished in 1995.

The first motor vehicle to cross the Canadian Rockies did so via Phillipps Pass in 1910, about 1 km north of Crowsnest Pass, and in 1917 a road was blasted around the shores of Crowsnest Lake and across Crowsnest Pass, renamed Interprovincial Highway Three in 1932. It is also known as the Crowsnest Highway.

On August 7, 1919, Captain Ernest Hoy flew a Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot; through Crowsnest Pass, the first flight across the Canadian Rockies.

==Natural resources==
The Crowsnest Pass area on both sides of the provincial boundary is rich in coal deposits, which were quickly developed after completion of the rail line. All the mines on the Alberta side were closed by the end of the 20th century as cheaper and safer open-pit mines opened on the British Columbia side of the pass. Some logging and oil and gas exploitation also occur in the area and a sulphur plant has been in operation there for several years. Tourism based on the natural and historical resources of the area remains underdeveloped but is slowly growing. The area hosts the world-class Sinister 7 Ultra Marathon, a 161-kilometre foot race that winds through the mountains around the community. Crowsnest Pass also has a local ski hill, Pass Powderkeg, and an outdoor pool.

==History==

*The Crowsnest Pass is the richest archaeological zone in the Canadian Rockies. The oldest relics are stone tools found on a rock ridge outside Frank, Alberta, from the Clovis culture, 11,000 years before present. Other sites include chert quarries on the Livingstone ridge dating back to 1000 BC.

<text>Jean Joseph Mounier (; 12 November 1758 – 28 January 1806) was a French politician and judge.

== Biography==
Mounier was born the son of a cloth merchant in Grenoble in Southeastern France. He studied law, and in 1782 purchased a minor judgeship at Grenoble. He took part in the struggle between the &quot;parlements&quot; and the court in 1788, and promoted the meeting of the estates of Dauphiné at Vizille (20 July 1788), on the eve of the French Revolution. He was secretary of the assembly, and drafted the &quot;cahiers&quot; (&quot;notebooks&quot;) of grievances and remonstrances presented by it to King Louis XVI. Thus brought into prominence, Mounier was unanimously elected deputy of the third estate to the Estates General of 1789; Mounier also founded the Monarchiens party in August 1789.

There, and in the Constituent Assembly, he was at first an upholder of the new ideas, pronouncing himself in favor of the union of the Third Estate with the two privileged orders, proposing the famous Tennis Court Oath, assisting in the preparation of the new constitution, and demanding the return of Jacques Necker. After the Estates General became the National Assembly, Mounier was elected to the committee on the constitution. Despite his skepticism of the abstract declaration of rights and his belief that such a declaration should be accompanied by a written constitution, Mounier was the principal author of the first three articles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, adopted on 6 August. On 28 September 1789 he was elected president of the Constituent Assembly. Being unable to approve the proceedings which followed, Mounier withdrew to Dauphiné, resigned as deputy, and, becoming suspect, took refuge in Switzerland in 1790.

He returned to France in 1801. Napoleon Bonaparte named him prefect of the department of Ille-et-Vilaine, which he reorganized, and in 1805, he was appointed councillor of state. He died in Paris. His principal writings are &quot;Considérations sur les gouvernements&quot; (1789); &quot;Recherches sur les causes qui ont empeché les Français de devenir libres&quot; (1792), and &quot;De l&#x27;influence attribuée aux philosophes, aux francs-maçons et aux illuminés sur la Révolution Française.&quot; (1801).

<doc id="374851" wikidata="Q7860911" url="?curid=374851" title="Typing rule">
<text>In type theory, a typing rule is an inference rule that describes how a type system assigns a type to a syntactic construction. These rules may be applied by the type system to determine if a program is well-typed and what type expressions have. A prototypical example of the use of typing rules is in defining type inference in the simply typed lambda calculus, which is the internal language of Cartesian closed categories.

== Notation ==
Typing rules specify the structure of a &quot;typing relation&quot; that relates syntactic terms to their types. Syntactically, the typing relation is usually denoted by a colon, so for example formula_1 denotes that an expression formula_2 has type formula_3. The rules themselves are usually specified using the notation of natural deduction. For example, the following typing rules specify the typing relation for a simple language of booleans:

:formula_4

Each rule states that the conclusion below the line may be derived from the premises above the line. The first two rules have no premises above the line, so they are axioms. The third rule has premises above the line (specifically, three premises), so it is an inference rule.

In programming languages, the type of a variable depends on where it is bound, which necessitates context-sensitive typing rules. These rules are given by a &quot;typing judgment&quot;, usually written formula_5, which states that an expression formula_2 has type formula_3 under a typing context formula_8 that relates variables to their types. Typing contexts are occasionally supplemented by the types of individual variables; for example, formula_9 can be read as &quot;the context formula_8 supplemented by the information that the expression formula_11 has type formula_12 yields the judgement that expression formula_2 has type formula_14&quot;. This notation can be used to give typing rules for variable references and lambda abstraction in the simply typed lambda calculus:

:formula_15

Similarly, the following typing rule describes the formula_16 construct of Standard ML:

:formula_17

Not all systems of typing rules directly specify a type checking algorithm. For example, the typing rule for applying a parametrically polymorphic function in the Hindley–Milner type system requires &quot;guessing&quot; the appropriate type at which the function should be instantiated. Adapting a declarative rule system to a decidable algorithm requires the production of a separate, algorithmic system that can be proven to specify the same typing relation.

<doc id="374852" wikidata="Q638409" url="?curid=374852" title="Mother's Milk (album)">
<text>Mother&#x27;s Milk is the fourth studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on August 16, 1989, by EMI Records. After the death of founding guitarist Hillel Slovak and the subsequent departure of drummer Jack Irons, vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea regrouped with the addition of guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith. Frusciante&#x27;s influence altered the band&#x27;s sound by placing more emphasis on melody than rhythm, which had dominated the band&#x27;s previous material. Returning producer Michael Beinhorn favored heavy metal guitar riffs as well as overdubbing. Frusciante perceived Beinhorn&#x27;s taste as excessive, and as a result, the two constantly fought over the album&#x27;s guitar sound.

&quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; was a greater commercial success than the band&#x27;s first three albums, peaking at number 52 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It received widespread airplay for the three singles which are the cover of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; and &quot;Taste the Pain&quot;, and it became their first gold record in early 1990. Although it was not met with the same positive critical reception that its predecessor &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot; (1987) had garnered, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; was the first step for the band in achieving international success and, according to Amy Hanson of AllMusic, &quot;turned the tide and transformed the band from underground funk-rocking rappers to mainstream bad boys with seemingly very little effort.&quot;

==Background==
After Red Hot Chili Peppers received a record deal with EMI Records in 1983, the group established themselves as a prominent funk rock band with their 1984 debut album &quot;The Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot;. Disappointed with the results of the production, vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea replaced guitarist Jack Sherman with founding member Hillel Slovak, who had quit his band, What Is This?, several weeks before. The group&#x27;s George Clinton-produced second album, &quot;Freaky Styley&quot; (1985), was Slovak&#x27;s first effort with the band. &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot;, which was released in 1987, saw the return of original drummer Jack Irons who had left the band prior to the recording of their debut album. The album, a critical success that peaked at number 148 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, is the only Red Hot Chili Peppers album the original members recorded together. Shortly following the ensuing tour, Slovak died of a heroin overdose and left the rest of the group in complete shock; Irons, citing an inability to cope with the death, quit. Kiedis and Flea, similarly devastated, were determined to persevere despite the loss of two key members. In September 1988 they chose DeWayne &quot;Blackbyrd&quot; McKnight, a friend of Clinton&#x27;s and former member of the funk band Parliament, to replace Slovak on guitar; D. H. Peligro, formerly of the punk rock outfit, Dead Kennedys, replaced Irons. Band manager Lindy Goetz realized that McKnight and Peligro were not well suited for the Chili Peppers, and the two were fired within several months of joining.

The band was not without a guitarist for long. In October 1988, Kiedis and Flea found a replacement for McKnight in teenage guitarist John Frusciante. Flea had originally directed Frusciante to audition for the band Thelonious Monster. An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, Frusciante was, according to Flea, &quot;a really talented and knowledgeable musician. He [Frusciante] knows all the shit I don&#x27;t know. I basically know nothing about music theory and he&#x27;s studied it to death, inside and out. He&#x27;s a very disciplined musician—all he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes.&quot; Frusciante was also not very familiar with the funk genre: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [Slovak]&#x27;s playing and I just took it sideways from there.&quot; The band was now once again without a drummer and were forced to hold open auditions. The last to audition, Chad Smith, was a six-foot three-inch tall drummer who, according to Flea, &quot;lit a fire under our asses.&quot; Kiedis later said the audition with Smith left &quot;[the band] in a state of frenzied laughter that we couldn&#x27;t shake out of for a half an hour.&quot;

==Recording and production==
Unlike the stop-start sessions for &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot;, where Kiedis would frequently disappear to seek drugs, pre-production for &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; went smoothly. Many of the songs had already been written, and some were even recorded by the time the band started pre-production in January 1989. &quot;Taste the Pain&quot; was recorded before Smith joined, and it featured Philip &quot;Fish&quot; Fisher of Fishbone on drums. The band recorded basic tracks at Hully Gully studios in Silver Lake; songs like &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; were formed from jam sessions without any input from returning producer Michael Beinhorn. According to Flea, the Hully Gully sessions bore fruit: &quot;We played hard and fast more than [at] any other time in our career, I think. A lot of chops were going down [...] we played constantly, got to know each other, and came up with a record.&quot; Kiedis and Flea recognized that Frusciante&#x27;s presence had become a significant influence on the band&#x27;s new material as the Hully Gully sessions were proving to be extremely productive; Flea recalled that &quot;[Frusciante] was an immense new element to the sound of our band and a big opening up for us.&quot;

The band entered the Ocean Way Recording studio in Hollywood in February 1989 to record &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;. &quot;It was weird when I first joined the band because we recorded the album after I&#x27;d been in the band for just a few months and Chad had actually been in for just two weeks,&quot; Frusciante recalled. &quot;I was still a little bit confused about my position and we were just like four individuals. Music is all about welding people into a unit and with all the touring we&#x27;ve been doing we&#x27;re now like an eight-armed cosmic octopus!&quot; Beinhorn pushed the Chili Peppers to produce the best possible takes for each of the record&#x27;s 13 tracks while the band hoped to obtain a hit record.

Although there had been stress and conflict during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the sessions for &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; were uncomfortable thanks to Beinhorn&#x27;s incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled that he and the band were at odds, saying, &quot;Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [with the band] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [them].&quot; Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, &quot;[Beinhorn] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones.&quot; Frusciante was frustrated with Beinhorn&#x27;s attitude, and he resented his playing on the record, thinking that it was too &quot;macho&quot;. Kiedis recalled that, in the end, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn&#x27;t feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him.&quot;

In March 1989, the Chili Peppers embarked on a two-month tour to break-in the new lineup. The &quot;Positive Mental Octopus tour&quot; saw the band play small venues throughout the United States, including several concerts on the East and West Coasts. At this time, Frusciante began asserting more energy and his ego &quot;got a little swollen,&quot; according to Flea. &quot;He was running around being rude to girls and getting them pissed off. But that&#x27;s to be expected, I mean, shit, you&#x27;re 18 years old and you want to get laid really bad and all of a sudden you&#x27;re in a band, the girls want to fuck. You&#x27;re bound to go crazy.&quot; Another incident, following a performance at the George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, caused legal repercussions; a student accused Kiedis of engaging in sexual misconduct and indecent exposure. Kiedis was subsequently arrested and released on bail pending a trial that was to be set for a later date.

==Music==
The band&#x27;s style of music developed with the arrival of Frusciante; producer Michael Beinhorn observed, &quot;It was apparent early on that John was the perfect guitarist for the band—he brought the elements of songwriting and composition to the band which they&#x27;d never truly had prior to his involvement. I believe that John is a pivotal figure in the Chili Peppers, being that he is such a distinctive songwriter.&quot; Frusciante altered the band&#x27;s sound by introducing melodies, harmonies and more-complex song structures. In contrast to the group&#x27;s previous albums, which featured groove and rhythm-based songs, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; contained melodic compositions that reflected the new guitarist&#x27;s influence. Per music journalist Jeff Apter, most of the record, due to Beinhorn&#x27;s presence, is composed of heavy metal guitar riffs and excessive layering. Musically, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; has been described as funk metal, alternative metal, and funk rock.

&quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; features an array of musical styles in its 13 tracks. Among the songs that surfaced from the Hully Gully sessions in early 1989, &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; became one of the most radical shifts in style for the band. The introspective lyrics, which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have on life, were a new approach for Kiedis, who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a hedonistic lifestyle. Kiedis did not, however, want the track to be associated with &quot;anti-drug&quot; sentiments, claiming, &quot;[the song] is about letting your friends know that you need help and then being willing to accept the help of others when you need it, whether it&#x27;s from drugs, or from a number of other personal problems.&quot; According to Apter, the song &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; was &quot;clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with socks hanging off their cocks.&quot; Musically, the track integrates the Chili Peppers&#x27; typical punk influences, but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more alternative territory. &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; was originally recorded to be a duet between Kiedis and Frusciante, but the song was remixed before being released as a single; the new mix inadvertently emphasized Frusciante&#x27;s voice instead of Kiedis&#x27;s.

&quot;Higher Ground&quot; became another song that helped the band achieve international success. Originally written and recorded in 1973 by R&amp;B singer Stevie Wonder, the track was, according to Flea, a perfect cover for the band: &quot;[...] the lyrics are great. Especially as far as the situation that the band has been in, as far as state of mind, for the past few months. That song is really about raising and uplifting yourself spiritually.&quot; Flea said the band covered the song to pay homage to Wonder and the important role he played in popular music. The cover begins with a funk bass-line, followed by multi-layered heavy metal guitar progressions and effects-treated vocals. &quot;Higher Ground&quot;&#x27;s chorus features backing vocals from an array of friends and engineers who worked on the record; the individuals&#x27; competence in singing was irrelevant to the band because they sought to achieve a sense of unity. &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; was composed of a variety of songs that expanded the Chili Peppers&#x27; repertoire. The instrumental &quot;Pretty Little Ditty&quot; was one of the few songs that featured no guitar layering; Apter notes that the song is &quot;a dreamy, sweetly stoned instrumental featured deft picking and strumming from Frusciante, intertwined with blasts of trumpet from Flea.&quot; The eclectic track was originally intended to be more than three minutes long, but was cut to just under two minutes before the album&#x27;s release. The song &quot;Punk Rock Classic&quot; quotes the guitar riff of &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; by Guns N&#x27; Roses. &quot;Taste the Pain&quot; reflects a more meditative and melodic theme, similar to &quot;Knock Me Down.&quot; Frusciante introduces psychedelic guitar progressions in the verse, while the lyrics touch on themes of love and loss. Other tracks such as &quot;Stone Cold Bush&quot; presented topics of prostitution while &quot;Punk Rock Classic&quot; was, in retrospect, an emulation of typical punk rock songs by Black Flag and The Germs—bands that were influential to the Chili Peppers.

Controversy arose when the model Dawn Alane claimed the band did not notify her that she was the one chosen to be on the cover of &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;. Furthermore, several national chains refused to sell the record because they believed the female subject displayed too much nudity. A more strictly censored version was manufactured for some retailers that featured the band members in far larger proportion than the original. The cover of the record was influenced by a promotional poster Kiedis had from the 1960s of Sly and the Family Stone, in which frontman Sly Stone held a miniaturized band in his palm. When Kiedis was finding shots of the band to use on the cover, Frusciante initially refused every photograph Kiedis showed him but settled on one of him sitting down laughing. &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; was affixed with an &quot;explicit language&quot; warning sticker that, according to Kiedis, &quot;Doesn&#x27;t bother me. Our lyrics are very explicit, whether it&#x27;s about sex or friendship or love for life in general.&quot; The cover booklet of the record features a painting by Hillel Slovak. Following the album&#x27;s release, a limited number of promotional posters were issued with the model&#x27;s breasts exposed. Alane had no knowledge of the pressing and sued the band, winning a $50,000 settlement.

The singles for &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; followed a similar artistic theme. The cover of &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; featured the band shirtless, in front of a photograph of an elephant in an African setting. &quot;Higher Ground&quot; was similar in that all four members — photographs of which were taken from the music video — were printed in front of a large image of Kiedis&#x27;s face. &quot;Taste the Pain&quot; featured the band together with a red and yellow background with the Chili Peppers&#x27; asterisk adjacent to the typeface.
==Promotion and release==
A promotional 12&quot; titled &quot;For the Thrashers&quot;, which contained four songs from the album, was released to radio stations to promote the then forthcoming album in the weeks leading up to its release. Director Drew Carolan shot a promotional video for &quot;Good Time Boys&quot; which was released on the 1989 Hard &#x27;n Heavy Vol. 2 collection. The video, which has never been released elsewhere by the band or even acknowledged as an official video, featured the band performing the song with cut away scenes of the band being interviewed discussing the album and their sound. Carolan was also hired to film the music videos for album&#x27;s first two singles, &quot;Higher Ground&quot; and &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; before the release of &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;. The initial premise for &quot;Higher Ground&quot; was to have the song&#x27;s original writer, Stevie Wonder, sit in the lotus position as the Chili Peppers dance around him; however, Wonder declined to be in the video. Kiedis gave full creative license to Carolan on the condition that he &quot;make us [the band] look like the Gods of Funk.&quot; While the video for &quot;Higher Ground&quot; was intended to be upbeat and exuberant, &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; was filmed to be more poignant; Carolan recalls, &quot;It was a very special track for the band and it needed to be treated with the utmost care and respect. Anthony and Flea just wanted it to be real soulful with a sense of urgency.&quot; The videos took a day each to complete and were filmed with relatively small budgets, but the outcome, as Jeff Apter notes, &quot;[B]ecame key elements of [the album&#x27;s] success.&quot; &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; is notable for featuring an appearance by actor Alex Winter, who would co-direct the video for the band&#x27;s third single, &quot;Taste the Pain&quot;. MTV introduced the band&#x27;s videos into their daily rotation, highlighting the band as up-and-coming and &quot;one to watch&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Although more commercially successful than the band&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; received mixed reviews from critics who were unimpressed with the excessive distortion found throughout the album. However, it was praised as well; Amy Hanson of AllMusic called it &quot;a pivotal album for the Red Hot Chili Peppers,&quot; and believed that &quot;if anyone doubted the pulsating power that leapt from the blistering opener, &#x27;Good Time Boys&#x27;, it took only a few bars of the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; outrageous, and brilliant, interpretation of the Stevie Wonder classic &#x27;Higher Ground&#x27; to prove that this new lineup was onto something special. Wrapping up with the aptly titled and truly punked-out &#x27;Punk Rock Classic&#x27; and the band&#x27;s own punched-up tribute to &#x27;Magic Johnson&#x27;, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; was everything the band had hoped for, and a little more besides.&quot; Steve Morse of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called it a &quot;high-octane fusion of metal, funk and rap—sort of Prince meets Jimi Hendrix in the Twilight Zone,&quot; while noting that &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; combined &quot;electrifying musicianship&quot;. &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; commented that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were &quot;the Mothers of Invention for the 1990s.&quot; In 2005, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; was ranked number 359 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

While Carly Darlin of the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; found the album to be &quot;an energetic and fun restatement of the RHCP whiplash funk attitude&quot;, she believed that &quot;with the exception of the dreamy instrumental &#x27;Pretty Little Ditty&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t break any new ground.&quot; She continued by saying that, if anything &quot;&quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; is a slight step away from the party-funk grooves of the last two albums and a return to the band&#x27;s punk-rock roots. They even reprise the cover of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &#x27;Fire&#x27;, which they did as a B-side for their &#x27;Fight Like A Brave&#x27; 12-inch two years ago.&quot; Furthermore, Mark Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said &quot;the polite term for albums like &#x27;Milk&#x27; is &#x27;eclectic&#x27;, but it really sounds as if the band is unraveling [...] Considering the circumstances, it&#x27;s not especially surprising that the album seems to be looking for someone to give it directions.&quot; However, Jenkins did believe Frusciante possessed &quot;solid metal chops and means to show them off.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau mocked the band&#x27;s ability to promote empathy and found the guitar layering in &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; to have been done improperly: &quot;punks who loved Hendrix and P-Funk way way back, they&#x27;re finally cashing in on their good taste, and though unbelievers dis their sincerity, execution&#x27;s the problem. They didn&#x27;t have the chops to bring it off then, and by pushing the guitar up front they sound even cruder now. But they&#x27;re perfectly nice fellas, really—mention &#x27;compassion&#x27; in the very first verse.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
Released on August 16, 1989, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; peaked at number 52 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and number 32 on the U.S. Cash Box album charts. The record failed to chart in the United Kingdom and Europe, but climbed to number 33 in Australia. &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; reached number six on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks whereas &quot;Higher Ground&quot; charted at number eleven; the latter of the two ultimately proved to be more successful, however, by influencing foreign charts at number fifty-four in the UK and forty-five in Australia and France. While &quot;Taste the Pain&quot; did not chart in the U.S., the single reached number twenty-six in the UK—the group&#x27;s first Top 40 single in the region. The success the Red Hot Chili Peppers achieved with &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; was something the group had been working towards since the release of their debut album; Apter notes, &quot;After five hard years, several departures, sackings and one tragic death, the Peppers were now much more than a hometown sensation.&quot; The band had played numerous concerts before the album&#x27;s release and aired new songs weekly to generate interest in it. &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in late March 1990—it is now certified platinum—and was the first Chili Peppers album to ship in excess of 500,000 units. In 2003 the album was re-released through EMI; all tracks were completely remastered and an additional six songs were included as well as hand written liner notes from Flea.

==&quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; tour and aftermath==

&quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; instantly garnered more attention than the band&#x27;s previous records and, as such, the venues the band performed in were able to accommodate far larger crowds. For the first time the band also upgraded to a full-fledged tour bus and added backup musicians and singers. Longtime friend, Keith &quot;Tree&quot; Barry was added to play horns and backup singers Kristen Vigard and Vicki Calhoun (who appeared in the video for &quot;Knock Me Down&quot;) also joined the tour. When the band hit England, roadie Robbie Allen (nicknamed Rob Rule) would open for the band providing a comedy performance in which he would pretend to cut off his own penis. Allen would later become one of the band&#x27;s backup singers on the One Hot Minute tour. The album&#x27;s official launch, however, was held in New York City at a club called Tramps; following this, Red Hot Chili Peppers embarked on an introductory European tour which included a free show in Amsterdam&#x27;s Dam Square that attracted over 10,000 attendees. On September 8, 1989, the band commenced their North American leg in Seattle. The leg saw an overwhelmingly positive response from critics across the country; following a concert in Portland, journalist John Foyston of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; noted the &quot;Hollywood-based quartet fomented an audience reaction that had to be seen to be believed. The stage-divers started rushing the stage from the moment the band walked on. Once on stage, it was an issue of luck and chutzpah.&quot; Todd Caudle of the Colorado Springs newspaper &quot;The Gazette&quot; said the Chili Peppers&#x27; performance at the Colorado Indoor Sports Complex was &quot;the kind of place where kids could be kids, and no one cared if soft drinks stuck to the floor and the rafters shook with a stunning barrage of decibels. People in the audience, steeped in sweat and pressing against the barricade in front of the stage, threw their arms up in unison and barked out approval of one fast, furiously-played song after another.&quot;
By the end of the leg, the band members were having trouble adjusting to their newfound fame as virtually every concert on the tour was sold out and &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; approached 500,000 units sold. &quot;Spin&quot; reported that following a show in Atlanta, Flea invited a woman to his hotel room for sexual intercourse, but locked himself in the bathroom upon arriving because all he could think of were his wife and daughter. Kiedis ended a two-year long relationship with actress Ione Skye, and Frusciante, looking back on the tour years later, admitted, &quot;I was totally abusing the situation [...] partying and screwing a bunch of girls. At 19, I might have looked like a stud but I was a weakling inside. I wasn&#x27;t proud of who I was then.&quot; Shortly before the end of the North American leg, the band filmed a performance at the Long Beach Arena, which was released as &quot;Psychedelic Sexfunk Live from Heaven&quot; in 1990. A concert at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1989 attracted over 10,000 attendees and was considered by band photographer Tony Woolliscroft to be &quot;the biggest [concert] I had seen them play at that point. It gave me a handle on how hard the band had worked in the USA in the years prior to this.&quot;

The tour continued in the United Kingdom, where the band was receiving less attention; Kiedis complained after several shows there, &quot;We&#x27;re huge in the States and it&#x27;s sort of frustrating and confusing that no one knows who we are here.&quot; It was not until after their return from the UK that &quot;Taste the Pain&quot; was released as a single and subsequently charted at number twenty-nine there. In March 1990, the band was asked to perform on MTV&#x27;s coverage of Spring break in Florida. At the event, Flea and Smith attempted to engage the audience by jumping from the stage; the situation got out of hand, and the two were alleged to have sexually assaulted and verbally abused a female audience member. They were arrested several days later on charges of battery, disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit a lascivious act, but released on $2,000 bail. Smith and Flea&#x27;s arrest worsened Kiedis&#x27;s impending charge in Virginia from the &quot;Positive Mental Octopus&quot; tour. He was convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure and sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000 per charge.

The Chili Peppers wound up the &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; tour with a variety of performances that included the 1990 Pinkpop Festival and several other large-scale concerts. Once complete, the band rested, and Frusciante and Flea organized a short-lived side project called H.A.T.E. with Fishbone vocalist Angelo Moore and L.A. Guns drummer Nickey Alexander. EMI capitalized on the recent interest in the Chili Peppers by releasing a music video compilation VHS called &quot;Positive Mental Octopus&quot;, which was named after the tour, in 1990. That same year the band also released &quot;Show Me Your Soul&quot;, a song that was originally a b-side on the &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; single, on the soundtrack to the hit romantic comedy film, &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. The song was a minor hit for the band and a music video was made. For unknown reasons the band also recorded a cover of the Bachman–Turner Overdrive song, &quot;Takin&#x27; Care of Business,&quot; however the song would never be released.

==25th anniversary==
On January 29, 2014, Chad Smith announced that EMI was planning to release a 25th anniversary version of the album later in the year, which would contain bonus material. In an August 2014 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Smith discussed the anniversary and legacy of the album, commenting that a remastered version was still in the works which would likely include a live show recorded in Cleveland, Ohio on a bonus disc. However, he reckoned that many of the outtakes from the record have already been released. , EMI has yet to re-release the album.

<text>Barlaam of Seminara (Bernardo Massari, as a layman), c. 1290–1348, or Barlaam of Calabria () was a Basilian monk, theologian and humanistic scholar born in southern Italy. He was a scholar and clergyman of the 14th century, as well as a humanist, philologist and theologian.

When Gregorios Palamas defended Hesychasm (the Eastern Orthodox Church&#x27;s mystical teaching on prayer), Barlaam accused him of heresy. Three Eastern Orthodox synods ruled against him and in Palamas&#x27;s favor (two Councils of Sophia in June and August 1341, and a Council of Blachernae in 1351).

==Early life==
Barlaam was born in what is now the &quot;comune&quot; of Seminara, Calabria, in a Greek-speaking Eastern Orthodox environment. He was an ethnic Greek.

==Early career==
Bernardo moved to Constantinople in the 1320s, where he soon gained entrance into ecclesiastical and political circles, especially those around the emperor Andronicus III Palaeologus, who gave him a teaching position at the university. He was tonsured a monk at the monastery of Sant&#x27;Elia di Capassino and given the name Barlaam.

Eventually, he was made the Hegumen (abbot) of the Monastery of Our Savior, and two confidential missions on behalf of the emperor were entrusted to him.

Historian Colin Wells characterizes Barlaam as &quot;brilliant but sharp-tongued&quot;, describing him as &quot;thoroughly versed in the classics, an astronomer, a mathematician, as well as a philosopher and a theologian. However, according to Wells, &quot;this formidable learning was coupled with an arrogant, sarcastic manner, so caustic at times that he put off even friends and allies.&quot;

During the years 1333–1334, Barlaam undertook to negotiate the union of churches with the representatives of Pope John XXII. For this occasion he wrote twenty-one treatises against the Latins in which he opposed papal primacy and the filioque doctrine. Emperor Andronicus III sent Barlaam on important diplomatic missions to Robert the Wise in Naples and to Philip VI in Paris. In 1339, he was sent to the exiled Pope Benedict XII at Avignon to suggest a crusade against the Turks and to discuss the union of churches, but he was not successful in this endeavour. On this occasion he met Petrarch.

Returning to Constantinople, Barlaam worked on commentaries on Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite under the patronage of John VI Kantakouzenos.

===Early conflict between Barlaam and Palamas===
Around 1336, Gregory Palamas received copies of treatises written by Barlaam against the Latins, condemning their insertion of the Filioque into the Nicene Creed. Palamas took issue with Barlaam&#x27;s argument in support of it, since Barlaam declared that efforts at demonstrating the nature of God (specifically, the nature of the Holy Spirit) should be abandoned, because God is ultimately unknowable and undemonstrable to humans. Thus, Barlaam asserted that it was impossible to determine from whom the Holy Spirit proceeds. According to Sara J. Denning-Bolle, Palamas viewed Barlaam&#x27;s argument as &quot;dangerously agnostic&quot;. In his response titled &quot;Apodictic Treatises&quot;, Palamas insisted that it was indeed demonstrable that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father but not from the Son. A series of letters ensued between the two but they were unable to resolve their differences amicably.

==The Hesychast controversy==

In contrast to Palamas&#x27; teaching that the &quot;glory of God&quot; revealed in various episodes of Jewish and Christian Scripture (e.g., the burning bush seen by Moses, the Light on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration) was in fact the uncreated Energies of God (i.e., the grace of God), Barlaam held that they were &quot;created&quot; effects, because no part of God whatsoever could be directly perceived by humans. The Eastern Orthodox interpreted his position as denying the renewing power of the Holy Spirit, which, in the words of various Eastern Orthodox hymns, &quot;made apostles out of fishermen&quot; (i.e., makes saints even out of uneducated people). In his anti-hesychastic works Barlaam held that knowledge of worldly wisdom was necessary for the perfection of the monks and denied the possibility of the vision of the divine life.

===Barlaam&#x27;s attack on Hesychasm===
Steven Runciman reports that, infuriated by Palamas&#x27; attacks against him, Barlaam vowed to humiliate Palamas by attacking the Hesychast teaching for which Palamas had become the chief proponent. Barlaam visited Thessalonica, where he made the acquaintance of monks who followed the Hesychast teachings. Runciman describes these monks as ignorant and lacking a real understanding of the Hesychast teaching. Barlaam issued a number of treatises mocking the absurdity of the practices which he reported included, &quot;miraculous separations and reunions of the spirit and the soul, of the traffic which demons have with the soul, of the difference between red lights and white lights, of the entry and departure of the intelligence through the nostrils with the breath, of the shields that gather together round the navel, and finally of the union of Our Lord with the soul, which takes place in the full and sensible certitude of the heart within the navel.&quot; Barlaam said that the monks had claimed to see the divine essence with bodily eyes, which he viewed as sheer Messalianism. When asked about the light which they saw, the monks told him that it was neither of the superessential Essence nor an angelic essence nor the Spirit itself, but that the spirit contemplated it as another hypostasis. Barlaam commented snidely, &quot;I must confess that I do not know what this light is. I only know that it does not exist.&quot;

According to Runciman, Barlaam&#x27;s attack struck home. He had shown that, in the hands of monks who were inadequately instructed and ignorant of the true Hesychast teaching, the psycho-physical precepts of Hesychasm could produce &quot;dangerous and ridiculous results&quot;. To many of the Byzantine intellectuals, Hesychasm appeared &quot;shockingly anti-intellectual&quot; Barlaam nicknamed the Hesychasts &quot;Omphaloscopoi&quot; (the navel-gazers); the nickname has coloured the tone of most subsequent Western writing about the Byzantine mystics. However, Barlaam&#x27;s triumph was short-lived. Ultimately, the Byzantines had a deep respect for mysticism even if they didn&#x27;t understand it. And, in Palamas, Barlaam found an opponent who was more than his equal in knowledge, intellect and expository skills.

===The Triads===
In response to Barlaam&#x27;s attacks, Palamas wrote nine treatises entitled &quot;Triads For The Defense of Those Who Practice Sacred Quietude&quot;. The treatises are called &quot;Triads&quot; because they were organized as three sets of three treatises.

The Triads were written in three stages. The first triad was written in the second half of the 1330s and are based on personal discussions between Palamas and Barlaam although Barlaam is never mentioned by name.

Gregory&#x27;s teaching was affirmed by the superiors and principal monks of Mt. Athos, who met in synod during 1340–1. In early 1341, the monastic communities of Mount Athos wrote the Hagioritic Tome under the supervision and inspiration of Palamas. Although the Tome does not mention Barlaam by name, the work clearly takes aim at Barlaam&#x27;s views. The Tome provides a systematic presentation of Palamas&#x27; teaching and became the fundamental textbook for Byzantine mysticism.

Barlaam also took exception to the doctrine held by the Hesychasts as to the uncreated nature of the light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of Hesychast practice, regarding it as heretical and blasphemous. It was maintained by the Hesychasts to be of divine origin and to be identical to the light which had been manifested to Jesus&#x27; disciples on Mount Tabor at the Transfiguration. Barlaam viewed this doctrine of &quot;uncreated light&quot; to be polytheistic because as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible and an invisible God. Barlaam accuses the use of the Jesus Prayer as being a practice of Bogomilism.

The second triad quotes some of Barlaam&#x27;s writings directly. In response to this second triad, Barlaam composed the treatise &quot;Against the Messalians&quot; linking the hesychasts to the Messalians and thereby accusing them of heresy. In &quot;Against the Messalians&quot;, Barlaam attacked Gregory by name for the first time. Barlaam derisively called the Hesychasts &quot;omphalopsychoi&quot; (men with their souls in their navels) and accused them of the heresy of Messalianism, also known as Bogomilism in the East. According to Meyendorff, Barlaam viewed &quot;any claim of real and conscious experience of God as Messalianism&quot;.

In the third Triad, Palamas refuted Barlaam&#x27;s charge of Messalianism by demonstrating that the Hesychasts did not share the antisacramentalism of the Messalians nor did they claim to physically see the essence of God with their eyes. According to John Meyendorff, &quot;Gregory Palamas orients his entire polemic against Barlaam the Calabrian on the issue of the Hellenic wisdom which he considers to be the main source of Barlaam’s errors.&quot;

===Hesychast councils at Constantinople===
It became clear that the dispute between Barlaam and Palamas was irreconcilable and would require the judgment of an episcopal council. A series of six patriarchal councils was held in Constantinople on 10 June 1341, August 1341, 4 November 1344, 1 February 1347, 8 February 1347, and 28 May 1351 to consider the issues.

The dispute over Hesychasm came before a synod held at Constantinople in May 1341 and presided over by the emperor Andronicus III. The assembly, influenced by the veneration in which the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius were held in the Eastern Church, condemned Barlaam, who recanted. The ecumenical patriarch insisted that all of Barlaam&#x27;s writings be destroyed and thus no complete copies of Barlaam&#x27;s treatise &quot;Against Messalianism&quot; have survived.

Barlaam&#x27;s primary supporter Emperor Andronicus III died just five days after the synod ended. Although Barlaam initially hoped for a second chance to present his case against Palamas, he soon realised the futility of pursuing his cause, and left for Calabria where he converted to the Latin Church and was appointed Bishop of Gerace.

==Later career==
After leaving Constantinople, Barlaam was received into the Latin Church at Avignon in 1342 and was consecrated Bishop of Gerace.

In 1346, he was appointed Papal Ambassador to Constantinople but, his mission having ended in failure, he returned to Gerace where he died in 1348.

==Legacy==

Barlaam, by his upbringing and philosophy, spanned the gap between the Christian East and West. Though he was never able to synthesize both traditions in a satisfactory manner, he did end up influencing both. The Zealots of Thessalonica were influenced by Barlaam&#x27;s teachings, and his arguments affected the dogmatic definition of Hesychasm in the Eastern Church. A master of the Greek language, he taught Petrarch some rudiments of Greek.

Critics see Barlaam&#x27;s elevation of philosophy above theology as being the reason for his condemnation by the Eastern Church:

Barlaam overestimated the significance of philosophy for theology, asserting that only through philosophy could humanity arrive at perfection. He thus denied the renewing power of the Holy Spirit, which makes saints even out of uneducated people, as it made the fishermen apostles. Being a humanist, Barlaam placed emphasis on created means of salvation (e.g., philosophy and knowledge) and reduced the role of the grace of the Holy Spirit.

According to Fr. John Meyendorff, &quot;Gregory Palamas orients his entire polemic against Barlaam the Calabrian on the issue of the &#x27;Hellenic wisdom&#x27; which he considers to be the main source of Barlaam’s errors.&quot; To this day, the issues which Barlaam raised are treated by Eastern Orthodox theologians:

Barlaam&#x27;s views – that we cannot really know Who the Holy Spirit is exactly (an outgrowth of which is agnosticism), that the ancient Greek philosophers are superior to the Prophets and the Apostles (since reason is above the vision of the Apostles), that the light of the Transfiguration is something which is created and can be undone, that the hesychastic way of life (i.e. the purification of the heart and the unceasing noetic prayer) is not essential – are views which express a supra-scholastic and, subsequently, a secularised point of view of theology. Saint Gregory Palamas foresaw the danger that these views held for Orthodoxy and through the power and energy of the Most Holy Spirit and the experience which he himself had acquired as a successor to the Holy Fathers, he confronted this great danger and preserved unadulterated the Orthodox Faith and Tradition.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Horners is one of the livery companies of the City of London. It existed in at least 1284. In 1476, the Leather Bottlemakers merged with the Horners. The company received its royal charter of incorporation in 1638.

Due to the decline of the trade of horn working, the company augmented its ongoing association with the ancient trade by encompassing new trades. In 1943, the company decided to support the plastics industry, as it continues to do. The company also acts as a charitable body.

The Horners&#x27; Company ranks fifty-fourth in the order of precedence for livery companies.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Farriers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. The Farriers, or horseshoe makers, organised in 1356. It received a Royal Charter of incorporation in 1674. Over the years, the Company has evolved from a trade association for horseshoe makers into an organisation for those devoted to equine welfare, including veterinary surgeons. It also supports general charities, as do other Livery Companies.

The Farriers&#x27; Company ranks fifty-fifth in the order of precedence for Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;Vi et Virtute&quot;, Latin for &quot;By Strength and by Virtue&quot;.

Today, the Company is one of the few Livery Companies still to play a formal role in its ancient trade. Section 1 of the Farriers (Registration) Act 1975 enshrined the Farriers&#x27; Company with continuing duties outside the traditional City of London jurisdiction that normally applies to livery companies. It provided, &quot;The Worshipful Company of Farriers (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) shall have the general function of securing adequate standards of competence and conduct among persons engaged in the shoeing of horses (hereinafter referred to as “farriers”) and shall promote, encourage and advance the art and science of farriery and education in connection with the said art and science&quot;.

== Past Masters ==
The Master of the Company serves for one year. The annual installation of a new Master for the Worshipful Company of Farriers takes place in September.

<doc id="374865" wikidata="Q529878" url="?curid=374865" title="50 State quarters">
<text>The 50 State quarters (authorized by ) were a series of circulating commemorative quarters released by the United States Mint. Minted from 1999 through 2008, they featured unique designs for each of the 50 US states on the reverse.

The 50 State Quarters Program was started to support a new generation of coin collectors, and it became the most successful numismatic program in US history, with roughly half of the US population collecting the coins, either in a casual manner or as a serious pursuit. The US federal government so far has made additional profits of $3 billion from collectors taking the coins out of circulation.

In 2009, the US Mint began issuing quarters under the 2009 District of Columbia and US Territories Program. The Territories Quarter Program was authorized by the passage of a newer legislative act, . This program features the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

== Origins ==
The 50 State Quarters program was initially inspired by a 1992 Royal Canadian Mint program, &quot;Canada 125&quot;, marking the 125th anniversary of the country&#x27;s Confederation with a series of commemorative 25-cent pieces representing each of its 12 (at the time) provinces and territories. The Canada 125 program sparked a revival of interest in coin collecting among Canadians, which led American numismatists to advocate for the United States Mint to create a similar series of coins representing U.S. states.

In 1992, Congress passed the 1996 Atlanta Centennial Olympic Games Commemorative Coin Act. In addition to authorizing a series of commemorative coins marking the 1996 Summer Olympics, the law also established the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee (CCCAC) to consider ideas for future releases. After Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen appointed the committee in December 1993, several of its members, led by David Ganz, urged the committee to endorse a state quarters program. Initially, Ganz found support from only Charles Atherton, from the Federal Commission on Fine Arts, and Dan Hoffman, a young numismatist from South Carolina who also served on the CCCAC. However, by 1995, the CCCAC finally endorsed the idea. The committee then sought the support of Representative Michael Castle (R-Delaware), chairman of the House Banking subcommittee with jurisdiction over the nation&#x27;s coinage. Castle&#x27;s initial caution was resolved when Diehl suggested the coins be issued in the order the states entered the Union or ratified the Constitution. Delaware, Castle&#x27;s home state, was the first state to ratify the Constitution, and would thus get to be the first state to have its quarter released. Castle subsequently held hearings and filed legislation to authorize the program.

Despite the support of the director of the mint and the Treasury Secretary-appointed CCCAC, the Treasury Department opposed the 50 States Quarters Program, as commemorative coinage had come to be identified with abuses and excesses. The Mint&#x27;s economic models estimated the program would earn the government between $2.6 billion and $5.1 billion in additional seignorage and $110 million in additional numismatic profits. Diehl and Castle used these profit projections to urge the Treasury&#x27;s support, but Treasury officials found the projections to lack credibility (at the program&#x27;s conclusion, the Mint estimated the program had earned $3 billion in additional seignorage and $136.2 million in additional numismatic profits).

Diehl worked with Castle behind the scenes to move legislation forward despite the Treasury&#x27;s opposition to the program. However, the Treasury suggested to Castle that the department should conduct a study to determine the feasibility of the program. With Diehl&#x27;s advice, Castle accepted the Treasury&#x27;s offer, and the agreement was codified in the United States Commemorative Coin Act of 1996. The act also authorized the Secretary to proceed with the 50 States Quarters Program without further congressional action if the results of the feasibility study were favorable.

The Treasury Department engaged the consulting firm Coopers and Lybrand to conduct the study in 1997, which confirmed the Mint&#x27;s demand, seignorage, and numismatic profit projections for the program. Among other conclusions, the study found that 98 million Americans were likely to save one or more full sets of the quarters (at the program&#x27;s conclusion, the Mint estimated that 147 million Americans collected the 50 state quarters). Nevertheless, the Treasury Department continued to oppose the program and declined to proceed with it without a congressional mandate to do so.

In 1997, Congress issued that mandate in the form of , the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on December 1, 1997.

== 50 State Quarters Program ==
The 50 State quarters were released by the United States Mint every ten weeks, or five each year. They were released in the same order that the states ratified the Constitution or were admitted to the Union. Each quarter&#x27;s reverse commemorated one of the 50 states with a design emblematic of its unique history, traditions, and symbols. Certain design elements, such as state flags, images of living persons, and head-and-shoulder images of deceased persons were prohibited.

The authorizing legislation and Mint procedures gave each state a substantial role and considerable discretion in determining the design that would represent their state. The majority of states followed a process by which the governor solicited the state&#x27;s citizens to submit design concepts and appointed an advisory group to oversee the process. Governors submitted three to five finalist design concepts to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval. Approved designs were returned to the states for selection of a final design.

States usually employed one of two approaches in making this selection. In 33 states, the governor selected the final recommended design, often based on the recommendations of advisory groups and citizens. In the other 17 states, citizens selected the final design through online, telephone, mail, or other public votes. US Mint engravers applied all final design concepts approved by the Treasury Secretary. The media and public attention surrounding this process and the release of each state&#x27;s quarter was intense and produced significant publicity for the program.

In several cases, the process of creating and finalizing a design caused controversy in the represented state, with people and groups expressing disappointment that the design did not properly reflect their state. There were disputes over which state could lay claim to certain design elements that appeared in other states, such as an ear of corn or the Rocky Mountains. The Mint&#x27;s conversion of each state&#x27;s proposal into the final design that was used on the quarter also drew criticism for being overly simplified or poorly rendered. Paul Jackson, whose design was chosen for the Missouri quarter and then pared down by the Mint, led a series of protests which included placing stickers with Jackson&#x27;s original design on the reverses of 250,000 quarters and distributing them nationwide. In response to these criticisms, the Mint established the Artistic Infusion Program in 2003, hiring more professional artists and engravers to create better-looking designs for all commemorative coins.

The 50 State Quarters Program was the most popular commemorative coin program in the United States history; the United States Mint has estimated that 147 million Americans have collected state quarters and 3.5 million participated in the selection of state quarter designs.

By the end of 2008, all of the original 50 States quarters had been minted and released. The official total, according to the US Mint, was 34,797,600,000 coins. The average mintage was 695,952,000 coins per state, but ranged from Virginia&#x27;s 1,594,616,000 to Oklahoma&#x27;s 416,600,000. Demand was stronger for quarters issued early in the program. This was due to weakening economic conditions in later years and the waning of the initial surge of demand when the program was launched. Another factor was the reassertion of the Treasury Department&#x27;s opposition to the program. When the director&#x27;s term ended in 2000, the Treasury proceeded to reduce and finally terminate the most effective elements of the Mint&#x27;s promotional program despite the high return on investment they earned.

== Designs ==

=== District of Columbia and United States Territories release ===
== Additional notes on individual designs ==

*Alabama: The Alabama state quarter is the first coin circulated in the US that features Braille writing.
*Arizona: The banner reading &quot;Grand Canyon State&quot; in the design is intended to split the quarter into two sections and indicate the Grand Canyon and the Saguaro Cactus are in two different Arizona scenes, as the saguaro cactus is not native to the area near the Grand Canyon.
*Connecticut: The Charter Oak on the back of the Connecticut quarter fell during a storm on August 21, 1856. It also appears on a 1936 half dollar commemorating the 300th anniversary of the state&#x27;s settlement by Europeans.
*Georgia: The outline of the state of Georgia on the quarter appears to have accidentally left out Dade County, which is in the extreme northwestern part of the state. In 1860, Dade residents voted to secede from the United States and from the state of Georgia. The county&#x27;s secession was never legally recognized, and Dade residents chose to &quot;rejoin&quot; the United States in 1945.
*Hawaii: The Hawaii quarter features a rendition of the statue of King Kamehameha I, who united the Hawaiian Islands in 1810, with the state outline and motto. This is the first business strike US coin to feature royalty or a monarch of any kind.
*Illinois: The Illinois quarter is the only quarter to directly reference and portray an urban city, with a picture of the Chicago skyline (the Missouri quarter indirectly references the city of St. Louis with its portrayal of the iconic Gateway Arch).
*Indiana: The Indiana quarter—having a problem similar to Georgia&#x27;s quarter—is missing part of its northwestern corner. Lake County is either partially or completely missing (where it borders with Lake Michigan). The error did not garner considerable notice.
*Iowa: When Iowans were debating the design for its state quarter in 2002, there was a grassroots effort to use a design featuring the Sullivan brothers (to honor the five Waterloo siblings who died when the ship they were aboard—the USS &quot;Juneau&quot; (CL-52)—sank during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, 1942). The effort was ultimately unsuccessful, and a Grant Wood design was used, but not before some copyright issues were resolved.
*Maryland: The Maryland Statehouse featured on the coin is the country&#x27;s largest wooden dome built without nails. Some residents complained that the quarter did not feature the state&#x27;s famous blue crab.
*Mississippi: The magnolia blossom design, while recognizable at the high levels of magnification at which it was presented for review, appears at production scale as an amorphous mass recognizable only when the accompanying state nickname inscription suggests the image&#x27;s intended content to the viewer.
*Missouri: The design contest winner for the Missouri quarter, Paul Jackson, has claimed that the Mint engraver needlessly redesigned Jackson&#x27;s original submission. The Mint stated that Jackson&#x27;s design was not coinable, but a private mint later demonstrated that it was. It emerged that Mint engravers may exercise discretion in the final design of US coinage, and the term &quot;design contest&quot; was dropped from solicitations for ideas for later state quarters.
*Nebraska: One of the final concepts for the Nebraska quarter was based on the Ponca leader Standing Bear, who, in a suit brought against the federal government, successfully argued that Native Americans were citizens entitled to rights under the US Constitution.
*New Hampshire: The Old Man of the Mountain, featured on the back of the New Hampshire quarter, collapsed in 2003, less than three years after the quarter&#x27;s release.
*New Jersey. The first coin in history to ever depict George Washington on both sides.
*Ohio: Astronauts John Glenn, Neil Armstrong, James Lovell, and Judith Resnik were all natives of Ohio, as were the Wright Brothers.
*Oregon: Oregon&#x27;s design features a scene of Crater Lake and Wizard Island. This design was chosen by the Oregon Commemorative Quarter Commission. The Quarter Commission was made up of 18 members, including Governor Ted Kulongoski, State Treasurer Randall Edwards, Columbia Sportswear Chairperson Gert Boyle, numismatist Monte Mensing, and Beaverton High School student Laura Davis, along with state legislators Charles Starr, Joan Dukes, Betsy Johnson, and Betsy Close, among others. The Quarter Commission chose the Crater Lake design from three other finalists: a jumping salmon, the Oregon Trail, and Mount Hood.
*Rhode Island: With a mast height of 199 ft (61m) the yacht &quot;Reliance&quot; could not have sailed under the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge, which has a clearance below of 188 ft (57m), although the coin does not show the ship sailing under the bridge. This would also not have happened because &quot;Reliance&quot; was sold for scrap in 1913 and the Pell Bridge opened in 1969. 
*South Dakota: Although South Dakota has the second highest proportion of Native Americans of any state, the South Dakota quarter features three items that are the result of European settlement. These symbols are Mount Rushmore, which honors four U.S. presidents and is carved into the Black Hills which are seen as sacred by the Lakota, a ring-necked pheasant (an introduced species of Asian origin), and wheat, a Eurasian crop which has replaced much of the state&#x27;s native grasslands.
*Tennessee: There has also been some controversy over the Tennessee quarter. Some sources claim that the details on the instruments depicted on the quarter are inaccurate, such as the number of strings on the guitar and the location of the tubing on the trumpet. The number of strings on the guitar-like instrument would be accurate if the instrument was a Mexican vihuela that influenced the country-and-western music prominent in Nashville culture and business. The instrument, however, has six tuning pegs, so is, in fact, a guitar and not a vihuela.
*West Virginia: During the submission process for the design of the West Virginia quarter, there was an apparent movement to put the famous Mothman on the final design.
*Wisconsin:A number of the Wisconsin quarters featured a small mint error: the ear of corn features an extra leaf. Some of the affected coins feature a &quot;low leaf&quot;, others feature a &quot;high leaf&quot;. All of these &quot;error coins&quot; were minted at the Denver mint. It is unclear whether the error was deliberate or accidental, but the error generated considerable initial interest. Sets of the flawed coins once sold on eBay for up to $2,800, although the 2013 edition of R.S. Yeoman&#x27;s &quot;A Guide Book of United States Coins&quot; lists considerably lower prices for uncirculated specimens.
*Wyoming: Some Wyoming quarters were released in 2007 with indications of improper quality control. Many persons, upon first seeing the same cowboy outline design used on the state&#x27;s automobile license plates, have mistakenly believed that the lack of detail is itself a flaw, the result of an incomplete striking. However, evidence of cracks in the die and subsequent hasty repairs have been observed in a few circulation specimens.

In 1997, Congress passed the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act, which instructed the creation of the 50 State quarters series to &quot;honor the unique Federal Republic of 50 States that comprise the United States; and to promote the diffusion of knowledge among the youth of the United States about the individual states, their history and geography, and the rich diversity of the national heritage...&quot;, and to encourage &quot;young people and their families to collect memorable tokens of all of the States for the face value of the coins.&quot;

While mintage totals of the various designs vary widely—Virginia quarters are almost 20 times as abundant as the Northern Marianas quarters—none of the regular circulating issues are rare enough to become a valuable investment.

There was, however, a measure of collector interest over die errors in the Wisconsin quarter. Some designs from the Denver mint feature corn without a smaller leaf, others feature a small leaf pointing upwards, and still others have the leaf bending down. A set of all three quarters sold on eBay in February 2005 for $300 and initially saw significant increases, such as $1500 for individual coins, but as of February 2020 PCGS lists the value of MS-62 specimens from $92 to $130 each.

Another die cast error ran with the first Delaware quarters. Being the first model of state quarter made, the mint gave it a disproportionate weight causing vending machines to not accept it. The quarter die was quickly fixed. Some Delaware quarters appeared without the last &quot;E&quot;, now saying, &quot;THE FIRST STAT&quot;.

A major error occurred in 2000 when the reverse die of a Sacagawea dollar was combined with the obverse die of a state quarter on dollar-coin planchets to form what is known as a &quot;mule&quot;. As of August 2019, only 19 of these specimens, produced on dollar planchets, are known to have escaped from the Mint.

A 2005 Minnesota double die quarter, as well as a 2005 Minnesota quarter with extra trees (another die error), have both triggered numismatic interest. An unusual die break on some 2005 Kansas quarters created a humpback bison. Relatively more common are Kansas quarters bearing the motto &quot;IN GOD WE RUST.&quot;

The United States produces proof coinage in circulating base metal and, since 1992, in separately sold sets with the dimes, quarters, and half-dollars in silver. For the silver issues, the 1999 set is the most valuable, being the first year of the series and with a relatively small mintage, although prices have significantly decreased since the 50 State Quarters Program ended. The set in base metal, of this or any other year, is worth only a fraction as much. The silver proof sets of later years, while having some intrinsic and collector worth, are also priced far lower. The public is cautioned to research prices before buying advertised state quarter year or proof sets.

In general, the program increased interest in quarter and general coin collecting. Large numbers of ads, quarter products and quarter information were available during the years the program ran. Home Shopping Network, Franklin Mint, and Littleton Coin Company were among the most prominent in ad space.

== Seigniorage ==
Since the 50 State Quarters Program was expected to increase public demand for quarters which would be collected and taken out of circulation, the Mint used economic models to estimate the additional seigniorage the program would produce. These estimates established a range of $2.6 billion to $5.1 billion. (At the end of the program, the Mint estimated the actual increase in seigniorage to be $3 billion.) The Mint also estimated the program would earn $110 million in additional numismatic profits. (The final, post-program estimate was $136.2 million.) The Mint used these estimates to support the proposed program, and the legislation enacting the 50 States Quarters program cited these estimates.

== Satire ==

*On July 25, 2001, &quot;The Onion&quot; ran a satirical news story titled &quot;Collecting All 50 State Quarters Senior&#x27;s Only Reason To Remain Alive&quot;. On May 4, 2005, it ran a further story titled &quot;U.S. Mint Gears Up To Issue Commemorative County Pennies&quot;.
*The &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; television show aired several segments about fictional satirical designs for new state quarters.
*Sculptor Daniel Carr, whose designs were used for the New York and Rhode Island state quarters and whose concept was adapted for the Maine state quarter, has created a series of parody quarters making light of the state quarter concept.

<text>Jules Arsène Arnaud Claretie (3 December 1840 – 23 December 1913) was a French literary figure and director of the &quot;Théâtre Français&quot;.

==Biography==
He was born at Limoges. After studying at the lycée Bonaparte in Paris, he became a journalist, achieving great success as dramatic critic to &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and to the &quot;Opinion nationale&quot;. He was a newspaper correspondent during the Franco-Prussian War, and during the Paris Commune acted as staff-officer in the National Guard. In 1885 he became director of the Théâtre Français, and from that time devoted his time chiefly to its administration until his death. During the battle for Octave Mirbeau&#x27;s comedy &quot;Les affaires sont les affaires&quot; (&quot;Business is business&quot;), the Comité de Lecture was abolished, in October 1901, and Jules Claretie obtained sole responsibility for choosing the modern plays to be performed. Claretie retired from the administration of the Théâtre Français in 1913.

He was elected a member of the Académie française in 1888, and took his seat in February 1889, being received by Ernest Renan.

==Works==
The long list of his works includes:
*&quot;Histoire de la révolution de 1870-1871&quot; (5 vols., 1875-1876)
*&quot;Cinq ans après: l&#x27;Alsace et la Lorraine depuis l&#x27;annexion&quot; (1876)
*some annual volumes of reprints of his articles in the weekly press, entitled &quot;La Vie à Paris; La Vie moderne au théâtre&quot; (1868-1869)
*&quot;Molière, sa vie et son œuvre&quot; (1871)
*&quot;Les Prussiens chez eux&quot; (1875)
*&quot;Histoire de la littérature française&quot; (2nd edition 1905)
*&quot;Candidat&quot; (1887), a novel of contemporary life
*&quot;Brichanteau, comédien français&quot; (1896)
&quot;La Vie à Paris&quot; was completed in 1913, and published after his death in 21 volumes in 1914.

Several plays, some of which are based on novels of his own:
*&quot;Les muscadins&quot; (1874)
*&quot;Le régiment de Champagne&quot; (1877)
*&quot;Les Mirabeau&quot; (1879)
*&quot;Monsieur le ministre&quot; (1883), and others

Claretie also wrote three operas for the music of Jules Massenet; &quot;La Navarraise&quot; (1894), based on his novel &quot;La cigarette&quot; and written with Henri Cain, &quot;Thérèse&quot; (1907), and &quot;Amadis&quot; (1922), a work begun by Massenet in 1895, but shelved and finished in the last years of his life and premiered posthumously.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Loriners is one of the ancient Livery Companies of the City of London. The organisation was originally a trade association for makers of metal parts for bridles, harnesses, spurs and other horse apparel; hence the company&#x27;s name, which comes from the Latin word &quot;lorum&quot; through the French word &quot;lormier&quot;.

==History==

The company&#x27;s first ordinances originate from 1261, which predate those of any other existing livery company, although its current ordinances were issued in 1741. The company was incorporated by a royal charter of 1711 in the reign of Queen Anne. It ranks fifty-seventh in the order of precedence of City Livery Companies. The Loriners&#x27; Company is permitted (by the Court of Aldermen) a Livery complement of up to 500 and currently comprises over 400 members (including assistants, liverymen, freemen and apprentices).

Whilst no longer authorised to regulate lorinery business throughout the London area, the company still administers examinations for students of its trade within the United Kingdom. It also acts as a charitable body.

The Loriners&#x27; coat of arms is &quot;Azure on a Chevron Argent, between three Manage-bits Or, as many Bosses Sable, supported asymmetrically by a single Horse, between Foliage of Palm and of Juniper&quot;. Mottoes, not being subject to the laws of English heraldry, have sometimes encouraged masters of the company to display a family motto with the company&#x27;s arms, thus the company has no established motto.

==Notable members==

The Master Loriner for 1992-93 was Anne, Princess Royal. Many other well known equestrians belong to its number including Captain Mark Phillips CVO and Samuel Vestey (Master of the Horse).

<text>The Worshipful Company of Paviors is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The Paviors can trace their history back to medieval times; they were responsible for the paving and maintenance of London&#x27;s streets. It received a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth II in 2004. The company is no longer a trade association for or a regulator of London&#x27;s road constructors. Today, it focuses on the promotion of excellence in all areas of construction.
The Paviors&#x27; Company ranks fifty-sixth in the order of precedence for livery companies.

==Early history==

From medieval times a small part of the City of London was paved, financed by a tax called pavage. In 1316, six Paviors were appointed by the City of London from which they gradually developed into a fellowship. In 1479, the Paviors received a code of ordinances from the City of London Corporation giving them authority for the first time over the “craft of paving”. The Paviors remained a modest company without a hall of its own or livery and its funds were held by a warden. Membership was small, around 20 at the end of the sixteenth century, and its meetings were held in various taverns. One peculiarity was that some Paviors were members of the Goldsmiths Company and there were instances of disputes being referred to the Court of Aldermen. Figures given in 1672 showed the paviors having 56 members and 35 Goldsmiths who were also on the books of the Paviors. One enlightened practice recorded in the sixteenth century was that widows were allowed to carry on the business of their late husbands and become full members of the company.

In 1673 the Paviors were granted a royal charter by King Charles II but it was rejected by the Court of Aldermen, and rejected again in 1679. Records indicated increased evidence of the Paviors exercising control over non-members, but this control eventually faded. A report in 1833 said that the compulsion to belong to the company had long gone, and payments and fines had declined. From the beginning of the Victorian era, “the decadence of the Company gradually developed” and “For over forty years a period of apathy prevailed”. No meeting of the company was held, and no new members were admitted. Eventually, a special meeting was held in 1889 to revive the company. This started with the award of prizes for essays on paving. The company applied for a livery, which was initially rejected by the Court of Aldermen but was finally granted in 1900.

==Charities and education==

The Worshipful Company of Paviors supports the following charities:

* Arkwright Scholarships Trust
* London Construction Academy
* Construction Youth Trust
* Paviors Hall of Road Making at the Amberley Museum &amp; Heritage Centre
* Ironbridge Gorge Museum
* Lord Mayor&#x27;s Appeal Charity
* Mansion House Scholarship Scheme
* Sherriffs&#x27; and Recorder&#x27;s Fund
* Guildhall School Trust

The company also makes regular donations to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral for the United Guilds Service and to St Martin-within-Ludgate Church, where the Paviors Company&#x27;s new Masters&#x27; installation ceremony takes place.

The funds come from the Paviors Company Livery Trust for Charities (Registered Charity No. 1102885) and from fund-raising events.

==Affiliations==
The paviors are affiliated with various groups and organizations.
* Frigate 
* Third Battalion Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment

<text>Lekain was the stage name of Henri Louis Cain (31 March 1728 – 8 February 1778), a French actor.

==Early career==
He was born in Paris, the son of a silversmith. He was educated at the Collège Mazarin, and joined an amateur company of players against which the Comédie-Française obtained an injunction. Voltaire supported him for a time and enabled him to act in his private theatre and also before the duchess of Maine.

==Comédie-Française==
He made his debut at the Comédie-Française on 14 September 1750 in the role of Titus in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Brutus&quot; and performed Seïde in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Mahomet&quot; on 30 September. Owing to the hostility of the actors it was only after a struggle of seventeen months that, by the command of King Louis XV he was accepted at the Comédie-Française (see Troupe of the Comédie-Française in 1752). He had performed the leading role of Orosmane at court in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Zaïre&quot;, causing Louis XV to declare: &quot;He made me weep, and I never weep.&quot; Lekain was made a member of the company on a trial basis at a salary of 12,000 livres per year on 4 January 1751 and was received definitively on 8 February 1752.

His success was immediate. Among his best parts were Herod the Great in &quot;Mariamne&quot;, Nero in &quot;Britannicus&quot; and similar tragic roles, in spite of the fact that he was short, stout, and lacking in good looks.

==Reforms==
His name is connected with several important scenic reforms. It was the practice in most theatres at the time for seating to be placed on the stage, and this was also true at the theatre of the Comédie-Française, the Salle de la rue des Fossés-Saint-Germain-des-Prés. High-priced tickets were sold to privileged spectators, who wanted to be seen but, as a consequence, obstructed the use of realistic scenery. Lekain and Diderot advocated for the actors to remove them; in 1759 Count Lauragais paid the excessive indemnity the actors demanded to compensate for the loss in revenue.
Lekain also protested against the method of sing-song declamation which was prevalent, and endeavoured to correct the costuming of the plays, although unable to obtain the historical accuracy that François Joseph Talma sought.

==Marriage==
Lekain married Christine-Charlotte-Josèphe Sirot on 28 July 1750. His wife made her debut at the Comédie-Française in March 1757 and was received on a trial basis on 25 April, and definitively in 1761. She retired with a pension of 1,000 livres in 1767 and died on 18 August 1775.

==Death==
Lekain died in Paris and was survived by two sons, Bernardin and Louis-Théodore.

His older son published his &quot;Mémoires&quot; (1801) with his correspondence with Voltaire, David Garrick and others. They were reprinted in &quot;Mémoires sur l&#x27;art dramatique&quot; (1825).

<text>Moscow on the Hudson is a 1984 American romantic comedy-drama film, written and directed by Paul Mazursky, starring Robin Williams as a Soviet circus musician who defects while on a visit to the United States. It co-stars María Conchita Alonso (in her American film debut), Elya Baskin as the circus clown, Savely Kramarov as one of two KGB apparatchiks, Alejandro Rey as the musician&#x27;s immigration attorney, and Cleavant Derricks as his first American host and friend.

The film was released on April 6, 1984.

==Plot==
Vladimir Ivanoff, a saxophonist with the Moscow circus, lives in a crowded apartment with his extended family. He stands in lines for hours to buy toilet paper and shoes. When Boris, the apparatchik assigned to the circus, criticizes Vladimir for being late to rehearsal, and warns him that he may miss the approaching trip to New York City, Vladimir gives Boris a pair of shoes from the queue that made Vladimir late. While Ivanoff is riding in his friend Anatoly&#x27;s Lada, Anatoly stops to buy fuel for his car from a mobile black-market gasoline dealer. While the friends wait for the gasoline seller to fill Anatoly&#x27;s jerrycans, the two practice their English.

The circus troupe is sent to perform in New York City. Anatoly, who has talked of little else but defecting, cannot bring himself to go through with it; Vladimir, who had opposed the scheme as reckless and foolhardy, suddenly decides to do it. He runs from his Soviet controllers and hides behind a perfume counter at Bloomingdale&#x27;s under the skirt of the clerk, Lucia Lombardo. When the NYPD and the FBI arrive, Vladimir stands up to his controllers and defects with news cameras rolling. Vladimir is left with nothing but the clothes on his back, the money in his pocket, and a pair of blue jeans that he had planned to buy for his girlfriend in Moscow.

Lionel Witherspoon, a security guard who protected Vladimir from his Russian handlers during the defection, takes him home to Harlem to live with Lionel&#x27;s mother, unemployed father, sister, and grandfather—a living arrangement noticeably similar to Vladimir&#x27;s family back in Moscow.

With the help of a sympathetic immigration attorney and Cuban emigrant, Orlando Ramirez, Vladimir soon adapts to life in the United States. Vladimir attempts to find work despite speaking little English and fearing the threat of his former KGB handlers. He initially works as a busboy, McDonald&#x27;s cashier, sidewalk merchant and limousine driver. Although these jobs enable Vladimir to eventually move into his own apartment, he begins to doubt that he will ever play saxophone professionally again.

Vladimir starts a relationship with Lucia. At a party celebrating Lucia&#x27;s becoming an American citizen, Vladimir proposes to her; but she refuses and, after an argument, breaks up with him. Lionel decides to return to Alabama to be closer to his minor son. However, more bad news comes in a letter from Vladimir&#x27;s family that his grandfather has died.

Grieving, Vladimir goes to a Russian nightclub to ease his mind. When he returns to his apartment building drunk, he is mugged by two youths. He reports the incident to the police with his attorney Orlando present; the two go to a diner, where Vladimir rants about his misfortunes. During a confrontation with a burly man who makes it known that he is also a Russian defector, Vladimir comes to appreciate his good fortune of living in the United States. Soon after, Lucia reunites with Vladimir, telling him that she is not ready for marriage, but would love to live with an immigrant. Lionel moves back from Alabama, and he takes over Vladimir&#x27;s job driving a limousine.

Vladimir encounters his former KGB handler, who is now a street vendor selling hotdogs. He admits that he had to flee the USSR due to his failure to prevent Vladimir&#x27;s defection, but has also come to appreciate New York City. Vladimir soon gets a job in a nightclub, where he again plays saxophone.

==Cast==

* Robin Williams as Vladimir Ivanov
* María Conchita Alonso as Lucia Lombardo
* Cleavant Derricks as Lionel Witherspoon
* Alejandro Rey as Orlando Ramirez
* Savely Kramarov as Boris
* Oleg Rudnik as Yuri
* Elya Baskin as Anatoly Cherkasov
* Yakov Smirnoff as Lev
==Production==
According to director Mazursky, the idea for the film came from Mazursky&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s emigration from Ukraine through Russia nearly 80 years before. When developing the script, the director contacted the Russian immigrant community and made his first trip to Russia. &quot;Most Russians&quot;, noted the director at the time, &quot;are just trying to survive. Yet, all Russians who leave their country leave behind something they treasure and love. It&#x27;s a terrible conflict for them, so the act of bravery is overwhelming.&quot;

After considering many locations for the Moscow portion of the film, Mazursky settled on Munich, based on the flexibility that Bavaria Studios offered him, with full control over an authentic &quot;Eastern European street&quot;.

Williams learned Russian for the film in a crash course, and he also learned to play the saxophone.

===Lawsuit===
The poster, depicting a bird&#x27;s eye view of New York, with Moscow and Russia beyond, prompted a lawsuit by artist Saul Steinberg. Steinberg alleged that the movie poster infringed on the copyright in &quot;View of the World from 9th Avenue&quot;, his famous cover illustration for a 1976 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The district court agreed, and awarded summary judgment to Steinberg in Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 706 (S.D.N.Y. 1987).

==Reception==
The film was moderately successful at the box office, bringing in $25 million in ticket sales.

 On Metacritic, it has a score of 67%, based on 11 reviews.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the film &quot;isn&#x27;t ill conceived; rather, it seems unfinished, not yet thought through&quot;, with Canby opining that the scene of Vladimir&#x27;s defection inside of Bloomingdale&#x27;s to be the film&#x27;s funniest; a &quot;tumultuous sequence, in which prissy floorwalkers, members of the Soviet secret police, the store&#x27;s public-relations personnel, New York City policemen and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents all are working at cross purposes&quot;.

Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that it was &quot;a wonderful comedy about a tragedy&quot;, and that as &quot;imaginative and mellow, this movie displays Mazursky&#x27;s distinctive funky lyricism at its best&quot;, although &quot;the film&#x27;s comic rhythm (though not its mood) falters in the last third&quot;.

<doc id="374886" wikidata="Q2712138" url="?curid=374886" title="Battle of Degsastan">
<text>The Battle of Degsastan was fought around 603 between king Æthelfrith of Bernicia and the Gaels under Áedán mac Gabráin, king of Dál Riada. Æthelfrith&#x27;s smaller army won a decisive victory, although his brother Theodbald was killed. Very little further is known about the battle. The location of the nominal Degsastan is not known, either; Dawstane in Liddesdale, Scotland, is a possibility.

According to Bede&#x27;s account in his &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; (Book I, chapter 34), Æthelfrith had won many victories against the Britons and was expanding his power and territory, and this concerned Áedán, who led &quot;an immense and mighty army&quot; against Æthelfrith. Although Æthelfrith had the smaller army, Bede reports that almost all of Áedán&#x27;s army was slain, and Áedán himself fled. After this defeat, according to Bede, the Irish kings in Britain would not make war against the English again, right up to Bede&#x27;s own time (130 years later).

Áedán&#x27;s army included the Bernician exile Hering, son of the former Bernician king Hussa; his participation is mentioned by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (manuscript E, year 603), and may indicate dynastic rivalry among the Bernicians. Áedán&#x27;s army also included the Cenél nEógain prince Máel Umai mac Báetáin, who is said by Irish sources to have slain Eanfrith, brother of Æthelfrith.

Áedán survived as King of Dál Riata until 608 when he was succeeded by his youngest son Eochaid Buide. Æthelfrith died in battle in 616.

<doc id="374887" wikidata="Q1478737" url="?curid=374887" title="Circulation issue">
<text>A circulation issue or circulation coin, sometimes called a business strike (US), is a coin minted and issued for commerce as opposed to those made as commemorative coins and proof coins. Circulation issue coins are normally produced in relatively large numbers, and are primarily meant to be used as pocket change, not collected. But after their withdrawal from circulation, these coins are highly valued by collectors, especially coins of high quality and without traces of use in trade. Preserved circulation coins are one of the primary sources by which scientists reconstruct the culture, history, and society of the time in which they were used.

Even though special collector coins, such as proof coinage, are produced in smaller numbers, the circulation issue coins are sometimes more valuable in high grade than their proof counterparts. This is because whereas proof coins are almost always carefully preserved by their owners, circulation issue usually are not.

== Officially &quot;unissued&quot; circulation coins ==
The state strictly controls the issuance of coins at mints to prevent counterfeit money&#x27;s distribution. However, collectors find coins that are not listed in the mint records or indicate that the mintage of these coins was destroyed . These coins are especially valuable to numismatists, as each one is associated with a unique story:

=== 5 cent 1913 Liberty Head nickel US ===
The United States Mint&#x27;s official records list no Liberty Head nickels produced that year. However, in December 1919, a previously unknown 1913 Liberty Head nickel was shown at a meeting of the Chicago Coin Club. The circumstances behind their creation are unknown. Only five examples exist. The finest known 1913 Liberty Head Nickel was auctioned in August 2018 at ANA U.S. Stacks Bowers Auction for $4,560,000,

=== 10 centesimi 1938 Vatican City ===
Officially, the coin is &quot;unissued.&quot;  and does not appear in the Mint of Rome&#x27;s records. Due to the death of Pope Pius XI, the circulation coins with the Pope&#x27;s name of 1938 were not issued, and only thanks to the passionate collector Vittorio Emanuele III, King of Italy, was this coin saved. Eight coins have been graded and certified by professional grading services (PCGS, NGC), and the finest known, with a grade of MS65,  has never been offered for sale,

=== 20 dollar 1933 double eagle US ===
Although the Mint records clearly show that no 1933 double eagles were issued, there were allegedly three weeks in March 1933 when 445,500 specimens were minted, none were ever officially circulated, and all but two were ordered to be melted down. These two coins should have been the only 1933 double eagle coins in existence. However, unknown to the mint, a number of the coins were stolen. Now known only 14 specimens, only one of which is privately owned. This coin with a grade of MS65 was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s 8 June 2021 auction for $18,872,250,

These are examples of the most coveted rarities circulation coins in numismatics.

<text>François Joseph Talma (15 January 1763 – 19 October 1826) was a French actor.

==Life==
He was born in Paris. His father, a dentist, moved to London, and saw that his son received a good English education. François Joseph returned to Paris, where for a year and a half he himself practised dentistry. His predilection for the stage was cultivated in amateur theatricals, and on 21 November 1787 he made his debut at the Comédie-Française as Seide in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Mahomet&quot;. His efforts from the first won approval, but for a considerable time he only obtained secondary parts.

It was as a juvenile lead that he first came to prominence, and he only gradually achieved his unrivalled position as the exponent of strong and concentrated passion. Talma was among the earliest advocates of realism in scenery and costume, being aided by his friend, the painter Jacques-Louis David. His first step in this direction was to appear in the small role of Proculus in Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Brutus&quot;, with a toga and short Roman haircut, much to the surprise of an audience accustomed to 18th century costume on stage, regardless of whether it suited the part played. 
He is often credited with having introduced the male Neoclassical hairstyle.

Talma possessed the physical gifts to enable him to excel, a striking appearance and a voice of beauty and power, which he gradually trained to perfection. At first somewhat stilted and monotonous in his manner, he came to be regarded as a model of simplicity. Talma married Julie Carreau, a rich and talented lady whose salon attracted the principal Girondists. The actor was an intimate friend of Napoleon, who delighted in his society - they knew each other even when the latter was an obscure officer in the French Army - and even, on his return from Elba, forgave him for performing before Louis XVIII. In 1808 the emperor had taken him to Erfurt and made him play the &quot;Mort de Cesar&quot; to a company of crowned heads. Five years later he took him to Dresden.

Talma was also a friend of Joseph Chénier, Georges Danton, Camille Desmoulins and other revolutionists. It was in Chenier&#x27;s anti-monarchical &quot;Charles IX&quot;, produced on 4 November 1789, that a prophetic couplet on the destruction of the Bastille made the house burst into a salvo of applause, led by Mirabeau. This play was responsible for the political dissensions in the Comédie-Française which resulted in the establishment, under Talma, of a new theatre.

By the 1820s, Talma was established as &quot;the dominant personality at the Comédie-Française, where he alone could still successfully impose classical tragedy upon the public&quot;. It was at this time that a young Alexandre Dumas, on one of his first visits to Paris, was inspired by a performance by Talma.

Talma made his last appearance on 11 June 1826 as Charles VI in Delaville&#x27;s tragedy, and he died in Paris on 19 October of that year.

In &quot;The Case of Wagner&quot;, Nietzsche references one of Talma&#x27;s dictums while derisively characterizing Wagner as an actor, and not a musician:
 
One is an actor by virtue of being ahead of mankind in one insight: what is meant to have the effect of truth must not be true. The proposition was formulated by Talma; it contains the whole psychology of the actor; it also contains--we need not doubt it--his morality. Wagner&#x27;s music is never true.

 But &quot;it is taken for true&quot;; and thus it is in order.

<doc id="374901" wikidata="Q388013" url="?curid=374901" title="Proof coinage">
<text>Proof coinage refers to special early samples of a coin issue, historically made for checking the dies (as in demonstrating that something is true) and for archival purposes. In modern times, proofs are often struck in greater numbers, especially for coin collectors (numismatists). Nearly all countries have issued proof coinage.

Preparation of a proof striking usually involved polishing of the dies. They can usually be distinguished from normal circulation coins by their sharper rims and design, as well as much smoother &quot;fields&quot;— the blank areas not part of the coin&#x27;s design.

The dies for making modern proof coins are often treated with chemicals to make certain parts of the design take on a frosted appearance, with the polished fields taking on a mirror finish. Several other methods have been used in the past to achieve this effect, including sand blasting the dies, and matte proofs. Proof coins of the early 19th century even appear to be scratched, but it was part of the production process. The term &quot;proof&quot; refers to the process by which the coins are made and not to the condition of the coin. Certification agencies can grade and assign numerical ratings for proof coins. A PR70 coin is the highest grade possible for a proof coin and indicates a perfect example, with PR69 and lower grades reflecting some deficiency in the strike, centering, details, or other aspect of the coin.

Most proof coins are double struck under higher pressure. This does not normally result in doubling that is readily observable, but does result in the devices being struck fully, resulting in intricate elements of the original die being present on the proof that may not be present in such detail on circulation strikes. After being struck, they are separately and individually handled, in contrast to normal coins which are collected in bins.

==Royal Mint proof coins==

William Wellesley Pole undertook the first rigorous attempt to catalog the coinage of Great Britain and Ireland starting in about 1816. Starting that year, proof specimens of coins and medals struck at the Royal Mint were produced for preservation.

Gold coins were omitted from proof sets produced for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

After decimalization, proof sets were heavily marketed internationally.

==United States proof coins==

The U.S. had largely stopped striking proof coins in 1916, although a few later specimens exist. From 1936 to 1942, proof coins could be ordered individually from the United States Mint. Beginning in 1950, customers could order proof coins only as complete sets.
From 1950 to 1955, proof sets were packaged in a box and each of the five coins was sealed in a cellophane bag. 1955 saw both the original &quot;box&quot; packaging and introduced the flat-pack, where the coins were sealed in cellophane and presented in an envelope. The flat-pack packaging continued through 1964, after which the coins were sealed in various styles of hard plasticized cases. (From 1965 to 1967 the production of proof sets was suspended and Special Mint Sets were made in their place. They were made at the San Francisco Assay Office but bore no &quot;S&quot; mint mark.)

Sets struck from 1936 to 1942 (1942 offered a five-coin and a six-coin version, the latter included the silver wartime nickel) and from 1950 to 1972 include the cent, nickel, dime, quarter, and half dollar. 

Since 1975, the San Francisco Mint has been used almost exclusively for proof coinage, with the exception of the Susan B. Anthony dollar from 1979–81 and 1999, and a portion of the mintage of cents in the early 1980s. The dollars and quarters bear a mint mark of an &quot;S&quot;, but the cents are otherwise indistinguishable from those minted at Philadelphia (which bear no mint marks, unlike those years&#x27; proof cents from San Francisco and circulation cents from Denver).

From 1973 through 1981 the dollar was also included, and also from 2000 on. The 1999–2008 proof sets also contain five different 50 State quarters. The 2004–2005 series also contain the two Lewis and Clark nickels. The 2007–2016 proof sets also include Presidential dollars. The 2010–2021 proof sets also contain America the Beautiful quarters, depicting different National Parks and Monuments. Proof sets issued in 2009 contain 18 coins— the most ever included— as that year featured four different reverses for the Lincoln Cent, six quarters issued under the District of Columbia and United States Territories quarters program, four Presidential and one Native American dollar struck that year, and the five cent, dime, and half dollar coins. Proof sets containing only 2009 cents, 50 State quarters, America the Beautiful quarters, Presidential dollars, and American Innovation dollars are also available.

The U.S. Mint has also released special proof sets, such as in 1976, when a proof set of three 40% silver-clad coins: the quarter, half-dollar and dollar coins depicting special reverses to commemorate the U.S. Bicentennial was issued. From 1971 to 1974, proof silver-clad Eisenhower dollars were issued in a plastic case contained in a brown wood-grain finish slipcase box, and are referred to as &quot;Brown Ikes&quot;. Proof Susan B. Anthony dollars were struck in 1999. Although these proof dollars were sold separately and not included in the proof sets for that year, some third parties used the cases from other years to create 1999 proof sets that include the dollar, prompting the U.S. Mint to advise the public that these sets were not government-issued sets. A proof &quot;Coin &amp; Chronicles&quot; set was issued for 2009, which included one each of the 4 different Lincoln Cent designs and a commemorative Lincoln Silver Dollar, presented in special packaging. Other sets, called &quot;Prestige Proof&quot; sets, also contain selected commemorative coins. These sets were sold from 1983 to 1997 (except 1985) at an additional premium. As Legacy Proof sets, the practice was resumed from 2005 to 2008.

Occasionally, there are errors which escape the Mint&#x27;s inspection process, resulting in some very rare and expensive proof sets. This has happened at least seven times: 1968-S, 1970-S and 1975-S and in the 1983-S Prestige set, each with a dime that has no mint mark; a small number of 1971-S sets included a nickel without a mint mark; 1990-S saw both regular and Prestige sets which included a penny with no mint mark.

Not as rare (or as expensive) are proof sets issued with coin varieties that are less common than those found in other sets issued in the same year. These include the 1960 and 1970-S sets, both of which are found in either a &quot;small date&quot; or &quot;large date&quot; variety, which refers to the size and position of the date on the Lincoln cent. The 1979-S and 1981-S sets each come in either a &quot;Type I&quot; or a &quot;Type II&quot; version, where on all coins the &quot;S&quot; mint mark is either &quot;filled&quot; (also known as the &quot;blob&quot; mint mark) or &quot;clear&quot;. 1964 has a design variation where the President&#x27;s portrait on the Kennedy half-dollar has &quot;accented hair&quot;. The design was modified early in the production (reputedly at the request of Jacqueline Kennedy) to give the hair a smoother appearance. This resulted in the &quot;accented hair&quot; variety being somewhat rarer and commanding a premium over the &quot;regular&quot; variety.

Since 1992 the mint has struck proof sets in both silver and base metal. Also, &quot;Silver Premier&quot; sets, featuring deluxe packaging, were offered from 1992 to 1998. U.S. commemorative and bullion platinum, palladium, gold, and silver coins are also often issued in both uncirculated and proof types, sometimes with different mint marks. From 1992 to 2018, the silver coins in silver proof sets contained &quot;coin silver&quot;, 90% silver and 10% copper, the same silver content as coins minted through 1964. Beginning in 2019, silver coins in silver proof sets were issued in &quot;fine silver&quot;, 99.9% silver, the same silver content as silver bullion coins. 

Starting in 1947 the U.S. mint began producing &quot;mint sets&quot;, and because of the terms used there is some confusion over the difference between these and proof sets. These are uncirculated coins that have been specially packaged, and are generally neither as expensive nor as valuable as proofs. There are some exceptions, however. Those produced from 1947 to 1958 (none were made in 1950) were double sets packaged in cardboard holders and have good collector demand. Because mint sets contain specimens from each mint the precious metal value of the coins in a mint set could exceed the value of a proof set for common dates. Another exception is the 1996 mint set, which, in addition to specimens from the Philadelphia and Denver mints, contained a Roosevelt dime from the West Point mint (commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Roosevelt dime) and which was available only in this mint set. From 1965 to 1967 the mint did not sell proof or uncirculated coins, but only a hybrid product, &quot;special mint sets&quot;, none of which are particularly valuable. From 2005 through 2010 the U.S. Mint used a special &quot;satin finish&quot; on the coins in its uncirculated sets, but in 2011 changed to a &quot;brilliant finish&quot; so that contact marks incurred during the normal production process would be less noticeable.

The Philadelphia and Denver mints also sold annual &quot;souvenir sets&quot; from their gift shops since 1973 (1972 for Denver). These are not mint sets and generally not of high collectable value, although the 1982 and 1983 sets are in demand, since no &quot;official&quot; mint sets were issued during those years. Sales of the souvenir sets ended in 1998 with the launch of the 50 State quarters. Finally, individual dealers have made unofficial &quot;year sets&quot;, privately packaging all denominations of a certain date. The latter have no value beyond their individual coins. Members of the public should be careful to understand what products they are being offered, and that, until supplies are exhausted, current and previous mint and proof sets are available directly from the mint.

<text>Irwin Lawrence &quot;Paul&quot; Mazursky (; April 25, 1930 – June 30, 2014) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor. Known for his dramatic comedies that often dealt with modern social issues, he was nominated for five Academy Awards for &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; (1969), &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot; (1978), &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; (1974), and &quot;Enemies, A Love Story&quot; (1989). He is also known for directing the autobiographical &quot;Next Stop, Greenwich Village&quot; (1976), &quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot; (1984), &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; (1986), &quot;Moon over Parador&quot; (1988), and &quot;Scenes from a Mall&quot; (1991).

==Early life and education==
He was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Jean (née Gerson), a piano player for dance classes, and David Mazursky, a laborer. Mazursky&#x27;s grandfather was an immigrant from Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic city of Kobrin (modern Belarus). Mazursky graduated from Brooklyn College in 1951.

==Career==
Mazursky began his film career as an actor in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s first feature, &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; (1953). Mazurksy, who never liked his first name of Irwin, was asked by his then-girlfriend Betty Purdy what name he wanted to use in the credits for the film, as he had told Kubrick to use her as a go-between when he was busy waiting tables at Sunrise Manor. When on the phone with her, she suggested using Paul for his screen name, which he agreed with. Two years later he appeared in a featured position as one of a classroom of teenagers with issues towards authority in &quot;The Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955). His acting career continued for several decades, starting with parts in episodes of television series such as &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;The Rifleman&quot;. He also did shows for nightclubs in the late 1950s, including with Herb Hartig in a comedy act named &quot;Igor and H&quot; before breaking up to do a solo act. He applied unsuccessfully to the Actors Studio, but he took classes from Lee Strasberg, having previously studied under Paul Mann and Curt Conway.
Soon after starting his acting career, Mazursky became a writer on &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot; in 1963 with Larry Tucker, who he had met when Tucker went from managing comedians to being in the Los Angeles The Second City troupe. In 1965, they crafted the script for the pilot of &quot;The Monkees&quot; television series, in which they both also appeared in cameos, although the pilot ended up being their only script for the series. Mazursky&#x27;s debut as a film screenwriter was the Peter Sellers comedy &quot;I Love You, Alice B. Toklas&quot; (1968). The original intent was for Tucker to produce and for Mazursky to direct. Peter Sellers, the star of the film, instead picked Hy Averback to direct. The following year, he directed his first film &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; (1969) produced and written by Mazursky and Larry Tucker), which proved to be a major critical and commercial success. The film was the fifth highest grossing of the year and earned Mazursky his first Oscar nomination.

His career behind the camera continued for two decades as he wrote and directed a prolific string of quirky, dramatic and critically popular films. His most successful films were contemporary dramatic comedies, including the Academy Award-winning &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; (1974), the Best Picture-nominated &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot; (1978), and popular hits such as &quot;Moscow on the Hudson&quot; (1984) and &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; (1986). In light of his comedies that tackled modern social subjects, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that &quot;from the late &#x27;60s through the &#x27;80s, [he] seemed to channel the zeitgeist...&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; stated that &quot;his oeuvre smacks of cultural significance.&quot;
Other films made by Mazursky during this time include the Hollywood satire &quot;Alex in Wonderland&quot; (1970), the cutting Los Angeles relationship comedy &quot;Blume in Love&quot; (1973), and the semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story &quot;Next Stop, Greenwich Village&quot; (1976). Mazursky played supporting roles in &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot; (1972; finished 2015) and &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (1976). He also directed the 1980s New York City-based &quot;Jules and Jim&quot; homage &quot;Willie &amp; Phil&quot; (1980), the contemporary Shakespeare comedy &quot;Tempest&quot; (1982), the Caribbean political farce &quot;Moon over Parador&quot; (1988), and the acclaimed Isaac Bashevis Singer adaptation &quot;Enemies, a Love Story&quot; (1989). Late in his life, Mazursky was developing a Broadway musical adaptation of his 1988 film &quot;Moon over Parador&quot;. He had supporting roles in &quot;History of the World Part I&quot; (1981), &quot;Into the Night&quot; (1985), &quot;Punchline&quot; (1988) and &quot;Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills&quot; (1989). 

Mazursky appeared in supporting roles or cameos in most of his own films. In &quot;Moon over Parador&quot; (1988), with the Rio Opera House available for only three days of shooting, Mazursky cast himself as a dictator&#x27;s mother when Judith Malina was unavailable, playing the character in drag. He also acted in 1990s in projects such as &quot;Man Trouble&quot; (1992), &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; (1993), &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1994), &quot;2 Days in the Valley&quot; (1996), &quot;Miami Rhapsody&quot; (1995), &quot;Crazy in Alabama&quot; (1999), and &quot;I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With&quot; (2006). He performed the voice of the Psychologist in &quot;Antz&quot; (1998). He experienced less success in the 1990s directing &quot;Scenes from a Mall&quot; (1991), starring Woody Allen and Bette Midler. 

Following his filmmaking satire &quot;The Pickle&quot; (1993), which was his last writing credit, Mazursky worked only sporadically as a director on such films as &quot;Faithful&quot; (1996), &quot;Winchell&quot; (1998), and &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; (2003). His final film was the independent documentary &quot;Yippee&quot; (2006). In later years, Mazursky had a small part as &quot;Sunshine&quot; the poker dealer in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. He also appeared in five episodes of season 4 of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; as Mel Brooks&#x27; associate Norm, a role that he later reprised in a season 7 episode. In his autobiography &quot;Show Me the Magic&quot; (1999), Mazursky recounts his experiences in filmmaking and with several well-known screen personalities including Peter Sellers. He was the subject of the 2011 book &quot;Paul on Mazursky&quot; by Sam Wasson. Mazursky appeared as himself in a number of documentaries on film, including &quot;A Decade Under the Influence&quot;, &quot;New York at the Movies&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. From 2011 until his death in 2014, Mazursky served as a film critic for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

== Legacy == 
Every film written and directed by Mazursky used New York City or Los Angeles as one of its settings. In 1991 the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented that &quot;No filmmaker has been wiser or funnier about the L.A. cavalcade than Mazursky. It&#x27;s not simply a matter of being hip to the scene; what makes such L.A. movies as &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; and &quot;Alex in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Blume in Love&quot; and &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; soar is Mazursky&#x27;s wide-eyed infatuation with the city&#x27;s rampant pop nuttiness.&quot; His films received a total of twelve Academy Award nominations, with one win, and nineteen Golden Globe nominations, with two wins. Film critic Roger Ebert was a particular fan of Mazursky&#x27;s work, giving six of his films the optimal four stars in his reviews. In 1986, Ebert stated that &quot;Mazursky has a way of making comedies that are more intelligent and relevant than most of the serious films around.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Mazursky was married to librarian and social worker Betsy Mazursky (née Purdy) from 1953 until his death. They had two daughters, Meg and Jill. Mazursky was an atheist.

Mazursky went into cardiopulmonary arrest and died on June 30, 2014, aged 84, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

<doc id="374909" wikidata="Q7889582" url="?curid=374909" title="United States Bicentennial">
<text>The United States Bicentennial was a series of celebrations and observances during the mid-1970s that paid tribute to historical events leading up to the creation of the United States as an independent republic. It was a central event in the memory of the American Revolution. The Bicentennial culminated on Sunday, July 4, 1976, with the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence by the Founding Fathers in the Second Continental Congress.

==Background==
The nation had always commemorated the founding as a gesture of patriotism and sometimes as an argument in political battles. Historian Jonathan Crider points out that in the 1850s, editors and orators both North and South claimed their region was the true custodian of the legacy of 1776, as they used the Revolution symbolically in their rhetoric.

The plans for the Bicentennial began when Congress created the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission on July 4, 1966. Initially, the Bicentennial celebration was planned as a single city exposition (titled Expo &#x27;76) that would be staged in either Philadelphia or Boston. After 6½ years of tumultuous debate, the Commission recommended that there should not be a single event, and Congress dissolved it on December 11, 1973, and created the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration (ARBA), which was charged with encouraging and coordinating locally sponsored events. David Ryan, a professor at University College Cork, notes that the Bicentennial was celebrated only a year after the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and that the Ford administration stressed the themes of renewal and rebirth based on a restoration of traditional values, giving a nostalgic and exclusive reading of the American past.

==Logo==

Bruce N. Blackburn, co-designer of the modernized NASA insignia, designed the logo. The logo consisted of a white five-point star inside a stylized star of red, white and blue. It was encircled by the inscription &quot;American Revolution Bicentennial 1776–1976&quot; in Helvetica Regular. An early use of the logo was on a 1971 US postage stamp. The logo became a flag that flew at many government facilities throughout the United States and appeared on many other souvenirs and postage stamps issued by the Postal Service. NASA painted the logo on the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center in 1976 where it remained until 1998 when the agency replaced it with its own emblem as part of 40th anniversary celebrations.

== 1973 events ==
===Boston Oil Party===
In 1973, on the shores of Boston Harbor, activists and history enthusiasts recreated the Boston Tea Party. Participants and spectators boasted signs and effigies, but no longer against the English crown and taxes. This protest was a call for &quot;environmental protection, racial justice, an end to corporate profiteering, and the impeachment of Richard Nixon.&quot; Several people threw packages and oil barrels labeled &quot;Gulf Oil&quot; and &quot;Exxon&quot; into Boston Harbor in symbolic opposition to corporate power, in the style of the Boston Tea Party. This reenactment later was termed as the &quot;Boston Oil Party&quot;, and roughly 10,000 people witnessed the dumping of oil conglomerates, as well as the hanging of an effigy of President Nixon.

== 1975 events ==

The official Bicentennial events began April 1, 1975, when the &quot;American Freedom Train&quot; launched in Wilmington, Delaware to start its 21-month, tour of the 48 contiguous states.

On April 18, 1975, President Gerald Ford traveled to Boston to light a third lantern at the historic Old North Church, symbolizing America&#x27;s third century. The following day, April 19, he delivered a major address in Concord, Massachusetts at the Old North Bridge where the &quot;shot heard round the world&quot; was fired, commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord which began the military aspect of the American Revolution. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot; &quot;more than 2,000 spectators were on hand&quot; as canons were fired and a Paul Revere reenactor rode through announcing the arrival of British Troops.

On December 31, 1975, the eve of the Bicentennial Year, Ford recorded a statement to address the American people by means of radio and television broadcasts. Presidential Proclamation 4411 was signed as an affirmation to the Founding Fathers of the United States principles of dignity, equality, government by representation, and liberty.

==1976 events==
1976 festivities included elaborate fireworks in the skies above major US cities. President Ford presided over the display in Washington, D.C., which was televised nationally. Celebrations in cities and towns across the nation opened into full effect including celebrations such as Operation Sail (Op Sail), a large international fleet parade of tall-masted sailing ships gathering first in New York City on Independence Day and then in Boston about one week later. Other large scale events such as reenactments, parades, and booms in commercialized commemoration spread across the nation as the year went on.

===New York===
In addition to the presence of the &#x27;tall ships&#x27;, navies of many nations sent warships to New York harbor for an International Naval Review held the morning of July 4. President Ford sailed down the Hudson River into New York harbor aboard the guided missile cruiser to review the international fleet and receive salutes from each visiting ship, ending with a salute from the British guided-missile destroyer . The review ended just above Liberty Island at around 10:30 am.

===Washington, D.C.===

Johnny Cash served as the Grand Marshal of the US Bicentennial parade.

The event was attended by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. The royal couple made a state visit to the United States, toured the country, and attended other Bicentennial functions with President and Mrs. Ford. Their visit aboard the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; included stops in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Virginia, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.

The Smithsonian Institution opened a long-term exhibition in its Arts and Industries Building replicating the look and feel of the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, including artifacts from earlier exposition. The Bicentennial Festival of American Folklife, a collaboration of the Smithsonian with thousands of national and international scholars, folk artisans, and performers, hosted programs in the western part of the National Mall five days a week for twelve weeks in the summer of 1976. The Smithsonian also opened the new home of the National Air and Space Museum on July 1, 1976.

===Government celebration===
George Washington was posthumously appointed to the grade of General of the Armies of the United States by the congressional joint resolution passed January 19, 1976, with an effective appointment date of July 4, 1976. This restored Washington&#x27;s position as the highest-ranking military officer in US history.

NASA commemorated the Bicentennial by staging a science and technology exhibit housed in a series of geodesic domes in the parking lot of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) called &quot;Third Century America&quot;. An American flag and the Bicentennial emblem were also painted on the side of the VAB; the emblem remained until 1998, when it was painted over with the NASA insignia. NASA planned for &quot;Viking 1&quot; to land on Mars on July 4, but the landing was delayed to July 20, the anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing. On the anniversary of the signing of the Constitution, NASA held the rollout ceremony of the first Space Shuttle (which NASA had planned to name &quot;Constitution&quot; but was, instead, named &quot;Enterprise&quot; in honor of its fictional namesake on the television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;).

===Delaware crossing reenactment===
On November 20 and 21 of 1976, participants immersed themselves in the era by donning period-accurate uniforms and equipping themselves with the tools and weaponry characteristic of that Christmas night over two centuries prior. The reenactment unfolded as a grand spectacle, featuring a flotilla of boats navigating the icy currents of the Delaware River.
Since then, the Crossing the Delaware reenactment has occurred every year to relive and recognize this moment.

===Philadelphia===
While in Philadelphia on July 6, 1976, Queen Elizabeth presented the Bicentennial Bell on behalf of the British people. The bell is a replica of the Liberty Bell, cast at the same foundry—Whitechapel Bell Foundry—and bearing the inscription &quot;For the People of the United States of America from the People of Britain 4 July 1976 LET FREEDOM RING.&quot;

===Los Angeles===
Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World presented &quot;America on Parade&quot;, an elaborate parade celebrating American history and culture, and featured the Sherman Brothers&#x27; song &quot;The Glorious Fourth&quot;. The parade featured nightly fireworks and ran twice daily from June 1975 to September 1976.

Los Angeles observances included the Bicentennial Parade of 1976 on Wilshire Boulevard, and the Los Angeles City Schools Bicentennial Pageant at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, broadcast as part of &quot;Happy Birthday, America&quot; (NBC), hosted by Paul Anka, &quot;Pacific 21&quot;, a bicentennial exhibition and conference center, and Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm bicentennial celebration.

===Professional sports celebrations===
The overall theme of the entertainment of Super Bowl X, held January 18, was to celebrate the Bicentennial. Players on both teams, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Dallas Cowboys, wore a special patch with the Bicentennial Logo on their jerseys; the Cowboys also added red, white, and blue striping to their helmets throughout the 1976 NFL season. The halftime show, featuring the performance group Up with People, was entitled &quot;200 Years and Just a Baby: A Tribute to America&#x27;s Bicentennial&quot;.

The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) initiated bids to host both the 1976 Summer and Winter Olympic Games in celebration of the Bicentennial. Los Angeles bid for the 1976 Summer Olympics but lost to Montreal. Denver was awarded the 1976 Winter Olympics in 1970, but concern over costs led Colorado voters to reject a referendum to fund the games and the International Olympic Committee awarded the games to Innsbruck, Austria, the 1964 host. As a result, there was no Olympics in the United States in 1976 despite a last minute offer from Salt Lake City to host. However, Lake Placid would host the 1980 Winter Olympics, Los Angeles would eventually be awarded the 1984 Summer Olympics, and Salt Lake City would also eventually be awarded the 2002 Winter Olympics.

As site of the Continental Congress and signing of the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia served as host for the 1976 NBA All-Star Game, the 1976 National Hockey League All-Star Game, the 1976 NCAA Final Four, and the 1976 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at which President Ford threw out the first pitch. The 1976 Pro Bowl was an exception and was played in New Orleans, likely due to weather concerns.

===Other===
Local observances included painting mailboxes and fire hydrants red, white, and blue. A wave of patriotism and nostalgia swept the nation and there was a general feeling that the irate era of the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and the Watergate constitutional crisis of 1974 had finally come to an end.
In the summer of 1976, the city of South Bend, Indiana, embarked on a unique project to commemorate the United States Bicentennial: painting its fire hydrants in vibrant colors and patriotic designs. Over four decades later, many of South Bend&#x27;s painted fire hydrants still stand as reminders of America&#x27;s Bicentennial celebration.

Bell Telephone Company commissioned Stanley Meltzoff to create a cover for its 1976 directory to commemorate both the Bicentennial and the centennial of the invention of the telephone. Based on Norman Rockwell&#x27;s &quot;The Gossips&quot;, Meltzoff depicted America&#x27;s great historic and iconic figures using the telephone. It became the biggest selling directory in Bell&#x27;s history.

Many national railroads and shortlines painted locomotives or rolling stock in patriotic color schemes, typically numbered 1776 or 1976, and model railroad manufacturers quickly released bicentennial locomotives which were popular among children and adults. Many military units marked aircraft with special designs in honor of the Bicentennial. John Warner served as ARBA director.

The New Jersey Lottery operated a special &quot;Bicentennial Lottery&quot; in which the winner received $1,776 per week (before taxes) for 20 years (a total of $1,847,040).

The Bicentennial Wagon Train Pilgrimage began a journey from Blaine, Washington on June 8, 1975, concluding at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania on July 4, 1976. The wagon train pilgrimage traced the original covered wagon trade and transportation routes across the United States encompassing the Bozeman Trail, California Trail, Gila Trail, Great Wagon Road, Mormon Trail, Natchez Trace Trail, Old Post Road, Old Spanish Trail, Oregon Trail, Santa Fe Trail, and Wilderness Road.

Karen Steele was the first baby born on July 4, 1976, 12 seconds after midnight, and was referred to as the &quot;Bicentennial Baby&quot;. She was featured on &quot;The Today Show&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and received commemorations from President Ford, New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne, and a host of other notables.

Many commercial products, including sports, apparel and collectibles, appeared in red, white, and blue packages in an attempt to tie them to the Bicentennial. Liberty, a brand of Spanish olives, sold their product in glass jars replicating the Liberty Bell during that time. Products were only permitted to display the trademarked Bicentennial logo by paying a license fee to ARBA.

==Ceremonial coinage==
The US government also commemorated the Bicentennial through the creation of new designs on national currency. The creation of the ceremonial coinage was both a way to get the American public involved in celebrating the bicentennial, and a way to encourage Americans to collect and purchase more bicentennial memorabilia.

The &quot;Bicentennial Minute&quot; was a series of short vignettes aired on CBS from 1974 through the end of 1976 to mark the occasion.

====Saturday morning Bicentennial programs====
In the months approaching the Bicentennial, &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot;, a series of educational cartoon shorts running on ABC between programs on Saturday mornings, created a sub-series called &quot;History Rock&quot;, although the official name was &quot;America Rock&quot;. The ten segments covered various aspects of American history and government. Several of the segments, most notably &quot;I&#x27;m Just a Bill&quot; (discussing the legislative process) and &quot;The Preamble&quot; (which features a variant of the preamble of the Constitution put to music), have become some of &quot;Schoolhouse Rock&quot; most popular segments.

In 1974, CBS aired a new animated Archie series on Saturday mornings called &quot;The U.S. of Archie&quot;; 16 episodes were made and were shown in reruns until September 1976.

===Films===

For the Bicentennial celebration, Hollywood filmmaker John Huston directed a short movie—&quot;Independence&quot; (1976)—for the US National Park Service which continues to screen at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia.

The 1976 film &quot;Rocky&quot; cited the Bicentennial in several scenes, mostly during Apollo Creed&#x27;s entering; Carl Weathers dressed first as George Washington and then as Uncle Sam.

The oversized vehicle in the 1976 film &quot;The Big Bus&quot; had a scene in its Bicentennial Dining Room.

==Gifts for the nation==

A number of nations gave gifts to the US as a token of friendship.

The United Kingdom loaned one of the four existing copies of Magna Carta for display in the US Capitol. The document was displayed in a case designed by artist Louis Osman consisting of gold, stainless steel, rubies, pearls, sapphires, diamonds, and white enamel. This was on a base of pegmatite and Yorkshire sandstone. The document was displayed atop a gold replica from June 3, 1976, until June 13, 1977, when it was returned. The case and gold replica remain on display in the Capitol.

Canada through the National Film Board of Canada produced the book &quot;Between Friends/Entre Amis&quot; which was a photographic essay of life along the US-Canada border. The book was given to libraries across the US and special editions were presented to President Ford and other officials.

The government of France and &quot;Musée du Louvre&quot; assembled an exhibit of paintings in cooperation with the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Metropolitan Museum of Art that traveled to Detroit and New York City after being shown in Paris. The exhibit, entitled &quot;French Painting 1774–1830: The Age of Revolution&quot;, included the work of 94 French artists from that period. Many of the 149 works in the exhibit had never been seen outside France and included &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot; by Eugène Delacroix, &quot;Jupiter and Thetis&quot; by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and a portrait of Maximilien Robespierre by Adélaïde Labille-Guiard.

Japan&#x27;s government constructed and furnished the 513-seat Terrace Theatre of Kennedy Center in Washington. Many of the original furnishings were removed when the theater was renovated between 2015 and 2019. Fifty-three bonsai trees from the Nippon Bonsai Association were donated to the US National Arboretum.

King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofía of Spain presented sculptures of &quot;Bernardo de Gálvez&quot;, a hero of the American Revolutionary War period and later Viceroy of New Spain; and &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, Cervantes&#x27; fictional hero, on June 3, 1976, on behalf of their nation. The Gálvez sculpture is in a park at Virginia Avenue at 21st Street NW, which has been named Galvez Park. The Don Quixote sculpture was installed nearby on the grounds of The Kennedy Center. Spain&#x27;s gift also included an exhibit at the National Gallery of Art of eight Goya masterpieces from the collection of .

King of Norway Olav V, Prime Minister of Norway Odvar Nordli, and the Norwegian government established the Vinland National Health Sports Center in Loretto, Minnesota.

<text>Mega Man 2 (stylized as Mega Man II) is a 1988 action-platform game developed and published by Capcom for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan in 1988 and in North America and PAL regions the following years. &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; continues Mega Man&#x27;s battle against the evil Dr. Wily and his rogue robots. It introduced graphical and gameplay changes, many of which became series staples.

Although sales for the original &quot;Mega Man &quot;were unimpressive, Capcom allowed the team to create a sequel. They worked concurrently on other Capcom projects, using their free time to develop the game, using unused content from the first game. Takashi Tateishi composed the soundtrack, with Yoshihiro Sakaguchi serving as a sound programmer.

&quot;Mega Man 2&quot; is the second best-selling &quot;Mega Man&quot; game, with more than 1.51 million copies sold. Critics praised its audio, visuals, and gameplay as an improvement over the first game. Many publications rank &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; as the best game in the series and one of the greatest video games of all time. The game&#x27;s soundtrack has also been considered one of the greatest video game soundtracks of all time. It has been included in several game compilations such as &quot;Mega Man Legacy Collection&quot;, rereleased for mobile devices, and become a part of console emulation services. A sequel, &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;, was released in 1990.

==Plot==
After his initial defeat, series antagonist Dr. Wily creates his own set of Robot Masters in an attempt to counter Mega Man: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man. He also constructs a new fortress and army of robotic henchmen.
Mega Man is then sent by his creator, Dr. Light, to defeat Dr. Wily and his Robot Masters. Mega Man defeats the eight new Robot Masters and then challenges Wily himself. During the final fight, Dr. Wily flees into the caves beneath his fortress. When Mega Man follows, Dr. Wily attempts to trick Mega Man into thinking he is a space alien. Mega Man defeats the alien, revealing it to be a holographic projection device with Dr. Wily at the controls of the now malfunctioning device. After the scientist begs for mercy, Mega Man spares Wily and returns home.

==Gameplay==

Like its predecessor, &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; is a platform and action game. The player controls Mega Man as he traverses eight stages to defeat the bosses, Dr. Wily&#x27;s Robot Masters: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man. Each Robot Master features a unique weapon and a stage related to their weapon&#x27;s power. For example, Air Man shoots small tornadoes and is fought in a sky-themed level, while Wood Man can use a shield of leaves and is found in a forest-themed stage. After defeating a boss, their signature weapon becomes available to the player. Each Robot Master is weak to the weapons of certain other Robot Masters; therefore, choosing the order in which the levels are played is a vital component of the gameplay. After completing certain stages, Mega Man receives a special item. These items create platforms that allow Mega Man to access areas that he otherwise could not.

After defeating the eight Robot Masters, the player proceeds to Dr. Wily&#x27;s fortress, which consists of six levels that are played linearly. As in the first game, the player is required to fight each Robot Master a second time in Dr. Wily&#x27;s fortress. However, these battles take place in a single room rather than a series of linearly connected rooms. The room contains teleportation devices that lead to each Robot Master. The devices can be entered in any order, but are not labeled. Once the bosses are defeated again, the player must fight Dr. Wily.

&quot;Mega Man 2&quot; features a few gameplay changes from the original &quot;Mega Man&quot;. A new item, the Energy Tank, allows a player to refill Mega Man&#x27;s health at any time. Also introduced is a password system. A password is displayed after defeating each Robot Master, allowing the player to return to that particular point in the game after restarting the system. The password stores the particular list of completed Robot Masters, as well as the number of accumulated Energy Tanks. Unlike the first game, &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; does not feature a score counter, and the player is unable to return to Robot Master levels once completed.

== Development ==


The first &quot;Mega Man&quot; game—released in 1987—was not successful enough to justify the immediate development of a sequel. According to Roy Ozaki, director Akira Kitamura had wanted to make a sequel to &quot;Mega Man&quot;, but producer Tokuro Fujiwara was against it. Kitamura then went to Capcom Vice-President to get permission to make the game. Capcom allowed the development team to create a sequel on the condition that they work concurrently on other projects as well. The staff spent their own time on the project to improve upon the original by adding more levels and weapons, as well as improving the graphics. The project supervisor of the first &quot;Mega Man&quot; invited Inafune to the sequel&#x27;s development crew; Inafune was working on a separate game at the time. On the previous game, Inafune worked as an artist and character designer but became more involved in the production process of the sequel. &quot;Working on [&quot;Mega Man 2&quot;] marked my second year at this, and I even got to mentor a &#x27;new kid&#x27;, which opened up a whole new world of stress for me,&quot; Inafune recounted. The development time for the game was only three to four months.

Due to the limited amount of cartridge space available for the first game, elements such as planned enemy characters were omitted from the final product. The unused content was later transferred to &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;. The team was limited by the graphical capabilities of the Nintendo Entertainment System, and designed characters as pixel art to maintain consistency between the designs and final product; some design elements, however, were lost in the transition. The gameplay system from the original game was kept for &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;, but the team included more traps for the player to navigate. The game&#x27;s three support items were added to aid the player because of complaints from consumers and Capcom&#x27;s marketing department regarding the original game&#x27;s high difficulty. Inafune&#x27;s supervisor was &quot;especially unsure&quot; about the usefulness of the Energy Tanks.

The first game did not have any influence from fans, but for the second game, Kitamura wanted to get ideas from players and put them in. The developers allowed input from the public by including boss designs created by fans. Capcom received 8,370 boss submissions for the game, although even the designs for the final eight Robot Masters were &quot;tweaked&quot;.

Inafune intended his artwork for &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; to be more &quot;anime-ish&quot; than in the first game. A second difficulty setting was added for the North American and European releases. The original version was labeled &quot;difficult&quot;, and a &quot;normal&quot; setting was created that made the &quot;arm cannon&quot; and boss weapons more powerful. Veteran video game cover illustrator Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol instead of his trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained that he was unfamiliar with the game and was directed by the Capcom America creative team to give Mega Man a pistol.

===Soundtrack===

The soundtrack for &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was composed by Takashi Tateishi (credited as Ogeretsu Kun), with &quot;Mega Man&quot; composer Manami Matsumae (credited as Manami Ietel) included for having her work on the credits theme from the first game repurposed for the title screen, and for co-composing a minor part of the melody for Air Man&#x27;s stage. Matsumae had been moved to the arcade division, considered more prestigious at the time, which necessitated a new composer. Matsumae and Tateishi worked closely during their time at Capcom, with Tateishi assisting Matsumae with &quot;U.N. Squadron&quot; in a similar manner during the period, albeit uncredited. Tateishi&#x27;s musical background was unusual compared to his contemporaries at Capcom, in that he had not been classically trained but was instead drawing on his experience performing in a band. He sought to consciously move away from the more classical sounding themes that were common at the time. He was also relatively new to the games industry, having only been hired by Capcom earlier that year for &quot;Mad Gear&quot; (1988). Tateishi would not remain with the franchise after &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;, as he and Kitamura both resigned from Capcom soon afterwards to work on &quot;Cocoron&quot;.

Tateishi&#x27;s initial compositions for the game were of varying moods, with some of them being considered &quot;too cute&quot; by Kitamura, requesting them to be changed to fit in with the rest of the soundtrack. A single fragment of this declined concept remains in the game as Crash Man&#x27;s stage theme. Tateishi has indicated that &quot;no one has&quot; the earlier, softer score. Stylistically the score was influenced by Mezzoforte and Yellow Magic Orchestra.

The widely praised piece used for the first two Wily stages was heavily compromised due to data limitations, with Tateishi being forced to use the first eight measures of the song multiple times throughout it. Tateishi intended to compose a song exclusive to the second stage, but also abandoned this idea for the same reasons. 

As with the previous game, the sound programming was handled by Yoshihiro Sakaguchi, credited as Yuukichan&#x27;s Papa.

== Reception ==
Though the first &quot;Mega Man&quot; game had relatively low sales, &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was a huge success. Since its 1988 release, &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide. The game is the second highest selling in the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series and Capcom&#x27;s 58th highest-selling game.

&quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was critically praised. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s four reviewers—Steve Harris, Ed Semrad, Donn Nauert, and Jim Allee—rated the game favorably, each scoring it 8 out of 10. They stated that it was better than the first &quot;Mega Man&quot;, citing the improved audio-visuals, new power-ups, and password system. Nauert and Allee, however, expressed disappointment that the game was less difficult than the first game. Nadia Oxford of 1UP.com complimented its aesthetics and gameplay. She further stated that &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; improved the gameplay of its predecessor by removing excessively difficult elements. &quot;Mean Machines&quot;″ two reviewers, Julian Rignall and Matt Regan, praised several aspects of the game. Rignall lauded the gameplay, citing its addictiveness and the puzzles. Regan praised the difficulty and called the gameplay balanced. Both reviewers complimented the graphics, calling them detailed and stunning, and described it as a great platform game. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; editor Richard Burton described it as a &quot;must-have&quot; game for the system, comments echoed by two of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s reviewers. Zach Miller writing for &quot;Game Informer&quot; attributed the success of the game to the players&#x27; option to defeat the stages in the order of their choosing. He praised the simple control scheme and the variety of weapons and items. GamesRadar ranked it the second-best NES game ever made, calling it &quot;the pinnacle&quot; of the 8-bit &quot;Mega Man&quot; games.

The game&#x27;s soundtrack has been well received by critics. Joey Becht of IGN listed three stage themes from &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; along with the main title song among the best in the series. In 2008, &quot;Game Informer&quot; listed &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;″s introduction sequence as the fifth-best video game opening, citing the build up of excitement that the music and appearance of the character instills. The &quot;Doctor Wily Stage Theme&quot; was ranked second in ScrewAttack&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Video Game Themes Ever&quot; video. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″ editorial staff praised the music in 2008, stating it is among the best on the platform. In 2009, Gamasutra&#x27;s Brandon Sheffield describe the music as easily recognizable and lamented that contemporary video game music lacked that trait. The opening riff from the &quot;Crash Man&quot; stage&#x27;s theme inspired the theme music for the YTV program &quot;Video &amp; Arcade Top 10&quot;.

&quot;Mega Man 2&quot; is a favorite among &quot;Mega Man&quot; fans, with many calling it the best in the series. Critics have also referred to the game as the series&#x27; best. Oxford considered it one of the most memorable game in the series, and Burton and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; both called the game the best in the series. IGN&#x27;s Levi Buchanan listed three of the game&#x27;s bosses among the &quot;Top 10 &quot;Mega Man&quot; Robot Masters&quot;. Several publications consider the game a critical success and have listed it high on &quot;top game&quot; lists. At the end of 1989, it was the top ranked game on &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s Top 30 list. In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named it the 73rd best console video game of all time, saying it was the most appealing and challenging game in the series. In August 2008, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; as the third best Nintendo Entertainment System video game. The editorial staff praised the polished improvements over the previous game. GameSpot named &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; as one of &quot;The Greatest Games of All Time&quot;. It ranked number 33 in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s &quot;Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever&quot; list and number 60 in &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;″s &quot;100 Best Nintendo Games&quot; list. Miller considered it one of the greatest games of all time. In 2007, IGN&#x27;s three editorial offices—United States, United Kingdom, and Australia—compiled a list of top 100 games. They listed &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; as number 67, citing the action and strategic elements along with the impact it had on the series. &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was placed 4th on IGN&#x27;s list of the Top 100 NES Games. &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was the first game on the cover of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. Game Informer placed the game 32nd on their top 100 video games of all time in 2001.

== Legacy ==

Kitamura chose to leave Capcom and joined the company Takeru, where he worked on the game &quot;Cocoron&quot; instead of &quot;Mega Man 3&quot;.

Keiji Inafune claims the success of &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; is what made the &quot;Mega Man&quot; series a hit that continues to spawn sequels. 1UP.com commented that the game helped establish the series as a prominent and commercially successful video game franchise. IGN cited &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; as helping define the platforming genre. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; credited it with helping the series obtain the global presence that allowed spin-offs and more sequels to be created. Many of the conventions of the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; series were defined by the first game, but &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; added crucial conventions that were retained for the rest of the series. The traditional number of Robot Masters for the series is eight as used in &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;, rather than the six used in the original. It was the first in the series to include an opening cinematic. &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; also introduced the Energy Tank item, special movement items, teleporter room, and password system, which became staples in future games. The Energy Tank became the series&#x27; iconic health refill item and later served as inspiration for a promotional &quot;Rockman E-Can&quot; drink. In developing &quot;Mega Man 9&quot;, producer Inafune and Hironobu Takeshita looked to the first two games in the series for inspiration, with &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; serving as a standard to surpass in order to meet fans&#x27; expectations. &quot;Mega Man Universe&quot; was to feature a remake of &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;″s story campaign, as well as feature customizable characters and levels. However, Capcom has officially announced the game&#x27;s cancellation due to &quot;various circumstances.&quot; In &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;, Wily Castle, as depicted in Mega Man 2, appears as a selectable stage in both versions of the game. The stage returned in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

=== Rereleases and adaptations ===
In 1990, Tiger Electronics produced a handheld electronic version with abridged gameplay. &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was remade in 1994 for the Sega Genesis game &quot;Mega Man: The Wily Wars&quot;, featuring updated graphics and sound. In 1999, &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was rereleased for the PlayStation as the second of six &quot;Rockman Complete Works&quot; discs, though only in Japan and under the original title &quot;Rockman 2&quot;. It is largely identical to the original NES release, but had a number of bonuses, such as a &quot;navi mode&quot; for beginners that presents the player with a slightly remade version of the game, detailed encyclopedic content, image galleries, and remixed music. &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was included with nine other games in the series in &quot;Mega Man Anniversary Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox, released between 2004 and 2005. The game&#x27;s emulation is identical to the re-release contained in &quot;Rockman Complete Works&quot;. Also in 2005, &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was released alongside other Capcom games as part of a &quot;Plug It In &amp; Play TV Games&quot; peripheral by Jakks Pacific. &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; made its way to mobile phones in 2007. The game was added as a part of the Wii Virtual Console service in PAL regions on December 14, 2007. In celebration of the ninth game&#x27;s release in September 2008, Capcom Japan released the game on August 26, 2008 in Japan and a North American release on September 15, 2008. In March 2009, Capcom released the game for iPhone OS, while in September of the same year the Complete Works version of &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was released on the Japanese PlayStation Store, making it available for download on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. Inafune expressed a desire to remake &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;, similar to &quot;Mega Man Powered Up&quot;, but stated that such a project was dependent on the commercial success of the latter. A tech demo for the Nintendo 3DS called &quot;Classic Games&quot; was shown at E3 2010, displaying more than a dozen classic games, including &quot;Mega Man 2&quot;, using 3D effects. Reggie Fils-Aimé announced that the games were slated for release on the 3DS and would possibly use the 3DS&#x27; features, such as 3D effects, analog control, or camera support. The game was released on the 3DS via the Virtual Console in Japan on August 8, 2012 and was released in Europe and North America on February 7, 2013.

&quot;Mega Man 2&quot; was novelized in the &quot;Worlds of Power&quot; series published by Scholastic in 1990. The novel mostly follows the game, even offering game hints at the end of some chapters. Besides the added dialogue, the one major variation in the novel is that Dr. Light fears Mega Man&#x27;s chances against Dr. Wily&#x27;s more powerful new robots and while attempting to duplicate him, accidentally turns him into a human being, a difficulty Mega Man must endure throughout the story. The book&#x27;s cover also lacks the gun depicted on the North American box art of the game, due to a &quot;no weapons&quot; policy that &quot;Worlds of Power&quot; writers had to abide by.

The game was also adapted into the third story arc for the Archie Comics &quot;Mega Man&quot; comic, &quot;The Return of Dr. Wily.&quot; In the arc, the Robot Masters are intended to either defeat Mega Man or infect him with a virus bit by bit as he absorbs their Special Weapons. All the Robot Masters are defeated but Mega Man ends up under Dr. Wily&#x27;s control until the Mega Man Powered Up Robot Masters come to his rescue. Dr. Wily escapes and sets his course for the Lanfront Ruins in South America, foreshadowing an adaptation of &quot;Super Adventure Rockman.&quot;

===Influence on nerd rock scene===

The &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; soundtrack is one of the most widely remixed soundtracks in gaming, and a great many covers were produced in the 2000s by various artists. &quot;Mixdown&quot; magazine described the soundtrack as one that would be &quot;rehashed and reimagined at conventions and festivals until the end of time&quot; and further that covering it had been a rite of passage in the early period of the nerd rock scene. Numerous artists and bands performed all or part of the soundtrack on studio albums in the 2000s, including The NESkimos on &quot;Battle Perfect Selection&quot; (2002), Chromelodeon on &quot;Year 20XX&quot; (2003), The Minibosses on &quot;Brass&quot; (2005), Mega Ran on his self titled album (2007), and The Megas on &quot;Get Equipped&quot; (2008). Many bands of the era additionally drew their stage names from the series, such as Armcannon, The Protomen and DJ Cutman. 

Capcom endorsed some of these groups, officially licensing Mega Ran&#x27;s 2007 cover album and bringing him to San Diego Comic-con that year. In 2010 The Megas were hired by Capcom to produce music for a &quot;Mega Man Universe&quot; trailer. All of these groups performed at the gaming music event MAGFest through the 2000s and 2010s. Tateishi himself appeared at Super MAGfest 2019 and gave an interview on the development of the game. He also introduced Bit Brigade&#x27;s performance of the score and performed on stage with Mega Ran. In a 2023 interview, Tateishi stated that his favourite rendition of the &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; score was JAM Project&#x27;s version. Many covers of &quot;Mega Man 2&quot; tracks appeared on Brave Wave&#x27;s &quot;Giants&quot; album in 2024, which included contributions from Tateishi himself.

<text>A sock puppet, sockpuppet, sock-puppet, or sock poppet is a puppet made from a sock or a similar garment. The puppeteer wears the sock on a hand and lower arm as if it were a glove, with the puppet&#x27;s mouth being formed by the region between the sock&#x27;s heel and toe, and the puppeteer&#x27;s thumb acting as the jaw. The arrangement of the fingers forms the shape of a mouth, which is sometimes padded with a hard piece of felt, often with a tongue glued inside.

The sock is stretched out fully so that it is long enough to cover the puppeteer&#x27;s wrist and part of the arm. Often, the puppeteer hides behind a stand and raises the hand above it so that only the puppet is visible. Sock puppeteers may also stand in full view along with their puppets and hold conversations with them through using ventriloquism.

==Composition==
Sock puppets can be made from socks or stockings of any color. Any sock may be used to create a puppet, but socks that are too tattered may fall apart during a performance, so they are usually bought new. Additions can be glued on in order to give the sock a personality. Streamers and felt strings might be glued on for hair. Buttons or googly eyes (obtained from craft or fabric stores) are used for the puppet&#x27;s eyes.

==Uses==
Sock puppets are often used for the education and entertainment of children. They can be used in elaborate puppet shows or children&#x27;s plays, much as marionettes would be. The process of making sock puppets is popularly taught as a creative activity in elementary schools. Many schools teach children to make sock puppets, which the students use to stage a play or musical.
Sock puppets appear in children&#x27;s television series where they can be used alone on the puppeteer&#x27;s hand, without a complex stage or show. Two orange sock puppets named Fu and Fara are used in teaching German children how to read. In the United States, children&#x27;s entertainer Shari Lewis was known for her television show &quot;Lamb Chop&#x27;s Play-Along&quot; featuring the sock puppets Lamb Chop, Charlie Horse, and Hush Puppy. Sock puppets are often used because they are less intimidating and scary, and, therefore, very child-friendly. In Bo Burnham&#x27;s &quot;Inside&quot;, one of his skits (How the World Works) is a parody of these shows where his sock puppet &quot;Socko&quot; tries to teach children about various injustices and conspiracy theories (such as the FBI killing Martin Luther King or the possibility of an elitist pedophile ring).

Sock puppets have also been used in television programming aimed at adults. The 1980s saw the introduction of the Ed the Sock character on local cable in Toronto, and the &quot;Sifl and Olly&quot; show aired on MTV in the 1990s. Both of these were aimed at teenagers and young adults. Sock puppets have also appeared in advertising geared towards adults. During the late 1990s, the e-commerce company &quot;Pets.com&quot; used a &quot;spokespuppet&quot; in its advertising to much critical acclaim. 

Sock puppets have also been used as the main figures in comedy videos on the internet, mostly to parody other media phenomena such as films and television series. Additionally, sock puppets have been used in a variety of Human Resource videos to aid in the education of employees regarding effective business practices.

Professional wrestler Mick Foley has long used a sock puppet by the name of Mr. Socko as an aid in his finishing maneuver, a nerve hold called the Mandible Claw (or Socko Claw), which is usually preceded by Foley theatrically pulling the sock from somewhere on his person. On World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; program, this has traditionally been a cue for commentator Jerry Lawler to complain about &quot;that stinking, sweaty sock!&quot; Mr. Socko has often served as a sidekick for Foley&#x27;s Mankind character, having been introduced to the world during a skit on WWE television as a means of &quot;cheering up&quot; WWE owner Vince McMahon, who had just been beaten by nemesis Stone Cold Steve Austin. The sock puppet unexpectedly became a hit with wrestling fans, garnering chants from a crowd of more than 10,000 at the following week&#x27;s program.

<doc id="374916" wikidata="Q3375172" url="?curid=374916" title="Yunti, Prince Xun">
<text>Yunti (10 February 1688 – 16 February 1755), born Yinzhen and also known as Yinti before 1722, formally known as [[Prince Xun (恂)|Prince Xun]], was a Manchu prince and military general of the Qing dynasty.
He was trusted by his father, the emperor Kangxi, to lead the imperial forces against the dynasty&#x27;s greatest threat of the time, the Dzungar Khanate. He proved a successful and popular military leader. He was later imprisoned by the new emperor, who was his full-blood brother – Yongzheng. Yongzheng suppressed the evidences of Yinti&#x27;s accomplishments and also possible evidences of his right to the throne.

==Life==
===Kangxi era===
Yunti was born &quot;Yinzhen&quot; () in the Aisin Gioro clan as the 14th son of the Kangxi Emperor. His mother was Empress Xiaogongren, who also bore the Yongzheng Emperor. As Yunti&#x27;s birth name &quot;Yinzhen&quot; was similar to that of his fourth brother, Yinzhen (胤禛), it was changed to &quot;Yinti&quot; (胤禵).

In 1709, Yinti was granted the title of a &quot;beizi&quot;. In 1718, after Dzungar forces defeated a Qing army along the Salween River in Tibet, the Kangxi Emperor appointed Yinti as &quot;Great General Who Pacifies the Frontier&quot; (撫遠大將軍) to lead an army of 300,000 into Tibet to attack the Dzungars and their leader, Tsewang Rabtan. It was believed that this was a sign that the Kangxi Emperor was considering Yinti as a potential heir to his throne. In February 1720, Yinti ordered his deputies Galbi and Yanxin to set out from Xining to take Lhasa, while he remained in Xining to build up support with their Mongol allies and then escort the Seventh Dalai Lama to Lhasa. On 24 September 1720, Yinti&#x27;s army captured Lhasa and returned the Dalai Lama to the Potala Palace.

===Yongzheng era===
On 21 December 1722, just as Yinti was planning for a conquest of the Dzungar Khanate, according to official accounts, he received news of the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s death and was immediately summoned back to the capital, Beijing, to attend his father&#x27;s funeral. His fourth brother, Yinzhen, succeeded their father and became historically known as the Yongzheng Emperor. It is now known, through Yongzheng&#x27;s correspondence, that he was called back either by his own father (presumably to arrange for Yinti&#x27;s succession to the throne), or his brother Yongzheng (under the name of Kangxi and with a forged edict that only mentioned the inheritance matter and not Kangxi&#x27;s death) who wanted to deceive him into renouncing his military powers. Yinti was only informed of his father&#x27;s death when he reached Shanxi. He initially had the idea of returning to his headquarters, but was persuaded not to do so. He then accepted that the throne was lost and decided to return to the capital, fully expecting to be executed by his brother. 

Yinti and his brothers had to change the character &quot;Yin&quot; (胤) in their names to &quot;Yun&quot; (允) to avoid naming taboo, because the reigning emperor&#x27;s personal name contained the character &quot;Yin&quot;.

In 1723, Yunti was promoted from &quot;beizi&quot; to &quot;junwang&quot; (second-rank prince). However, in the following year, he was demoted back to &quot;beizi&quot;. The Yongzheng Emperor perceived Yunti as a potential threat to his throne, so he stripped Yunti of his &quot;beizi&quot; title in 1725 and placed him under house arrest at Shouhuang Palace, in the present-day Jingshan Park. He seemed to have been moved many times. In 1734, he had a daughter with a maid servant somewhere near the Yuanyou Pagoda in the . By the time Yongzheng died in 1735, it was reported by the Korean emissaries that he was kept at the back garden of the Old Summer Palace (where his brother usually lived). They also reported that shortly before his brother died, the security around the prisoner, who was guarded by one thousand armored soldiers, was only increased, even though otherwise his brother, who seemed to fear him the most, treated him well.

At one point, Yongzheng seemed to have offered Yinti freedom in exchange for service but he refused. He angrily retorted that , the man who was sent to persuade him, should be killed before he accepted to serve Yongzheng in any capability (Maersai played an important role in suppressing Yinti during Yongzheng&#x27;s succession or usurption of the throne and after the case of Cai Huaixi, who sent a letter to Yinti to invite him to reclaim the throne).

===Qianlong era===
In 1735, the Yongzheng Emperor died and was succeeded by his fourth son Hongli, who became historically known as the Qianlong Emperor. The Qianlong Emperor released Yunti in the same year after his coronation. In 1737, Yunti was restored to the ranks of nobility as a &quot;fuguo gong&quot; (a lesser duke). Ten years later, in 1747, he was promoted to &quot;beile&quot;. In 1748, he was further promoted back to &quot;junwang&quot; and granted the title &quot;Prince Xun of the Second Rank&quot; (恂郡王).

Yunti died on 16 February 1755 and was posthumously honoured as Prince Xunqin of the Second Rank (恂勤郡王). The Prince Xun peerage was inherited by his second son, Hongming (弘明; 1705–1767), who became a &quot;beile&quot; in 1735.

He finished his impressive season having played in all of Canterbury&#x27;s 27 matches and scoring 10 tries, which was the first time since Terry Lamb that a Canterbury five-eighth had scored more than 10 tries in a season.

===2013===
For game 1 of the 2013 State of Origin series, Reynolds was selected to fill in for the injured Kurt Gidley on the interchange bench but did not get a run on the field. He retained his bench spot for game 2, making his official New South Wales debut in the 26–6 loss at Suncorp Stadium. Reynolds wasn&#x27;t chosen for game 3.

Reynolds was selected to play for NSW City in the City vs Country Origin match playing at , and scored a try in the 26-all draw in Dubbo. Reynolds was chosen as New South Wales five-eighth alongside Bulldogs halves partner Trent Hodkinson for all three games of the 2014 State of Origin series, during which the Blues ended Queensland&#x27;s 8-series winning streak. On 5 October 2014, in the 2014 NRL Grand Final against the South Sydney Rabbitohs, Reynolds played at five-eighth in Canterbury’s 30–6 loss. Reynolds finished the year with 19 matches and 2 tries for the Canterbury club.

===2015===

Reynolds was selected for the City Origin team at five-eighth as an audition for the vacant five-eighth position for New South Wales. He was penalised and placed on report twice in the second half, one for an attempted trip on Country forward Tariq Sims as he scored a try in the 52nd minute, and in the 77th minute for a shoulder charge on fullback David Mead. He was suspended for one week, and not selected for the Blues team. In the week 1 Elimination Final match against the St George Illawarra Dragons, Reynolds kicked a field goal to win the match for Canterbury 11–10 in golden point extra time. He finished the season with 17 matches, scoring three tries and kicking two field goals.

===2016===
In round 4, against the South Sydney Rabbitohs, Reynolds played his 100th NRL career match in Canterbury&#x27;s 42–12 win at ANZ Stadium. In round 8, against the Gold Coast Titans, he kicked a field goal in golden point extra time to win the match for the Canterbury club 21–20. Reynolds finished the season with 8 tries and 2 field goals from 25 matches.

===2017===
In February, Reynolds was captain of Canterbury&#x27;s 2017 Auckland Nines squad. On 26 April, after weeks of speculation where Reynolds would go after the season&#x27;s end, he signed a four-year contract with the Wests Tigers. The value was believed to be around $3 million over four years. It was quoted in many articles that he &quot;felt sick&quot; about leaving the Canterbury club. His influence on teammates also evident when club captain, James Graham, appeared visibly upset on the TV show NRL 360 while talking of Reynolds departure at the end of the year. In Round 18 against the Newcastle Knights, in his final game at Belmore Oval, he was sent off a winner at the death, with Moses Mbye running 70 metres to score the match winning try, afterwards the crowd ran onto the field to celebrate with Reynolds after securing a 20–18 victory. In Round 26 against the St George Illawarra Dragons, Reynolds played his last match in Canterbury colours but injured his ankle in process of scoring his try and sat out most of his farewell match in the 26–20 win at ANZ Stadium. Reynolds finished his last year with Canterbury scoring 5 tries from 17 matches.

===2018===
After the departure of Aaron Woods, Reynolds was named as one of 5 co-captains at Wests Tigers, alongside Benji Marshall, Chris Lawrence, Russell Packer and Elijah Taylor. Coach Ivan Cleary said, &quot;I just think it&#x27;s the right model for us right now. When we started this preseason it was pretty obvious straight away that there was no real pecking order. There was no set culture to adhere to. It was all new.&quot;

Named at five-eighth for round 1, Reynolds was a late withdrawal with a hamstring tear. Reynolds then made his long-awaited debut in round 6 against Manly but suffered a shoulder bone fracture and was ruled out for at least 4–6 weeks. On 17 July, Reynolds was ruled out for the season with a shoulder injury, having scored two tries from his five appearances.

===2019===
Reynolds was not selected for first-grade in the opening rounds, playing for the Western Suburbs Magpies feeder team instead. New coach Michael Maguire said, &quot;He&#x27;s had some issues with his body over the last couple of years and it&#x27;s going to take some time. I just want to see him get out and enjoy his football.&quot; With an injury to Benji Marshall, Reynolds made his return to first grade in round 4, setting up 2 tries and getting a further 2 repeat sets with his kicking game in a Man of the Match performance. After getting a further 2 repeat sets in round 5, commentator Braith Anasta said, &quot;He’s becoming a master at these kicks. He gets the timing and the depth of the kicks and he’s the first one there in the chase.&quot;

In July 2019, Reynolds was told by Wests that he was free to negotiate with other teams for the 2020 season after it was revealed that he wasn&#x27;t in the club&#x27;s plans following the conclusion of the 2019 season.

====Controversy====
On 12 December 2019, it was revealed that Reynolds was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm relating to an alleged domestic violence incident. The matter was handed to the NRL&#x27;s Integrity Unit. Reynolds&#x27; club later read out a statement saying “Wests Tigers have today confirmed that Josh Reynolds has been charged by New South Wales Police with a domestic violence offence. Both Josh and Wests Tigers have previously alerted the police and the NRL to this matter and will continue to work closely with the NRL Integrity Unit and NSW Police as Josh vigorously defends this charge. As this is an ongoing legal matter, Wests Tigers will be making no further comment at this time&quot;.

Reynolds was granted conditional bail to appear at Sutherland Local Court on 18 December 2019.

On 18 December 2019, Reynolds pleaded not guilty to the charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Reynolds argued that bruising found on his ex-partner was not the result of violence, but instead a side-effect of medication she had been taking. The case was later adjourned until 23 July 2020.

On 22 January 2020, Fox Sports released a video which was leaked online showing Reynolds verbally abusing a woman who was at his residence. In the 37 second video, Reynolds can be seen swearing at the woman saying &quot;Give me my phone, where the fuck is it? Get out of my house. I want you out now. I want you out now or I&#x27;m going to fucking flip it. I swear to god I&#x27;m going to flip it&quot;. Reynolds then called the woman a &quot;cunt&quot; and a &quot;dog&quot;. The Wests Tigers then released a statement saying &quot;Both Josh and Wests Tigers have previously alerted the NRL Unit as to this matter and will continue to work closely with them as required. As the subject matter is before the courts, Wests Tigers will be making no further comment&quot;.

On 6 February 2020, Reynolds was cleared to play by the NRL and had his court case in relation to domestic violence charges moved forward to 29 April 2020. It was also revealed by the Nine Network that the woman at the centre of Reynold&#x27;s court case was an alleged con artist with several men coming forward claiming to have had relationships with the woman who had used fake names and had stolen money under false pretences in each individual relationship. It was alleged in Reynold&#x27;s relationship with the woman that she faked being pregnant on three separate occasions. Reynolds also claimed the woman had told him her mother died and she needed money for the funeral when she was in fact alive and well.

On 26 February 2020, Reynolds had all of charges against him dropped and his court case was cancelled, and when Reynolds spoke to the media, he sent a message to the woman involved saying &quot;Arabella, whatever your name is, you said to me that you were going to bring me and my mum down. But we&#x27;re still standing, we&#x27;re still here. So that&#x27;s just a little message to you. You tried to bring me, my family and my mum down – and it didn&#x27;t work&quot;.

===2020===
In round 2 of the 2020 NRL season, Reynolds scored his first try of the year and provided a try assist but it wasn&#x27;t enough as the club were defeated 24–42 by Newcastle at an empty Leichhardt Oval.

On 6 September, it was reported that Reynolds and teammate Russell Packer had left the Wests Tigers round 17 match against Manly-Warringah at half-time which was against team protocols. Wests Tigers CEO Justin Pascoe released a statement saying &quot;The actions are not acceptable from my perspective. We are focused on ensuring every single person, player coach administrator board members actions are in complete alignment with the expectation of higher standards&quot;.

Reynolds played a total of ten games for Wests in the 2020 NRL season scoring one try as the club missed out on the finals by finishing 11th.

On 6 December 2020, it was announced that Reynolds had been released from the remainder of his contract with Wests Tigers, and had signed a two-year deal (with the option of a third) with Betfred Super League side Hull F.C. After signing with Hull, Reynolds spoke
to the media saying “To be fair I was a dud buy for the Tigers because they didn’t get their moneys worth, That’s fine, I’m happy to admit that. But then again I can’t control injury or selection so I don’t know what people want me to do&quot;.

===2021===
In round 1 of the 2021 Super League season, Reynolds made his debut for Hull F.C. and put in a man of the match performance which included scoring a try in a 22–10 win over Huddersfield.

The following week, Reynolds scored two tries in a 35–4 victory over Salford.

===2022===
On 22 June 2022, Hull F.C. released a statement confirming they had reached a mutual agreement with Reynolds to terminate his contract early. This follows a very poor spell with the club which did not live up to the expectations of both the club and its supporters. Reynolds was known to be the clubs highest paid player in their history but the clubs management decided to cut their losses to allow recruitment to begin for a replacement.
On 26 October, Reynolds re-joined his former club Canterbury on a 12-week train and trial contract.

=== 2023 ===
On 28 January, Reynolds was informed he had been elevated to the Top 30 squad for the Canterbury club, with the news being made public on 1 February.
Reynolds was left out of the Canterbury side for their opening round loss against Manly. He instead played for the club&#x27;s NSW Cup team. On 2 April, Reynolds made his return to first-grade for Canterbury, playing off the bench in their 15-14 win over the North Queensland Cowboys.

On July 10, Reynolds announced his retirement from professional rugby league, after it was revealed he selflessly gave up his position in the club’s top 30 squad to allow the club to sign halfback Toby Sexton from the Gold Coast Titans.

== Honours ==
On 18 February 2024, Reynolds was inducted as a life member of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.

<doc id="374924" wikidata="Q1062201" url="?curid=374924" title="The Old Capital">
<text>is a novel by Japanese writer Yasunari Kawabata first published in 1962. It was one of three novels cited by the Nobel Committee in their decision to award Kawabata the 1968 Nobel Prize in Literature.

&quot;The Old Capital&quot; was first translated into English in 1987 by J. Martin Holman. A revised edition of Holman&#x27;s translation was published in February 2006.

==Plot==
Chieko Sada is the daughter of Takichiro and Shige, who operate a wholesale dry goods shop in the Nakagyo
Ward of Kyoto. Now twenty, Chieko has known since she was in middle school that she was a foundling adopted by Takichiro and Shige. However, as told by Shige, they snatched Chieko when she was a baby &quot;Under the cherry blossoms at night at Gion Shrine&quot;. The discrepancy on whether Chieko was a foundling or stolen is part of the plot and is revealed later in the story.

Soon after a chance encounter at Yasaka Shrine, Chieko learns of a twin sister Naeko, who had remained in her home village in Kitayama working in the mountain forests of cryptomeria north of the city. The identical looks of Chieko and Naeko confuse Hideo, a traditional weaver, who is one potential suitor of Chieko. The novel, one of the last that Kawabata completed before his death, examines themes common to much of his literature: aging and decline; old culture in the commercial new Japan; the muted expression of strong yet repressed emotion; the role of accident and misunderstanding in shaping lives.

The story is set in Kyoto, and incorporates various festivals celebrated there. One of these is the Gion festival which occurs in the book during July. As part of the Gion festival, there is a parade of floats constructed by various neighborhoods in Kyoto and one of Chieko&#x27;s fond memories is of Shin&#x27;ichi, who is also interested in Chieko, participating as a festival boy. The Festival of the Ages is another important festival and this is where Hideo takes Chieko&#x27;s twin, Naeko, to view the parade.

==Reception==
Although Kawabata did not consider it his best work, it shares the same themes as his other novels. &quot;The Old Capital&quot; was one of three novels cited by the Nobel Committee in awarding the 1968 Prize for Literature to Kawabata. The other two were &quot;Snow Country&quot; and &quot;Thousand Cranes&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The novel was adapted in 1963 into a Japanese feature film known in English under the title &quot;Twin Sisters of Kyoto&quot;. Directed by Noboru Nakamura, it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. A second film adaptation under the novel&#x27;s original title Koto was made in 1980 by director Kon Ichikawa. Another film adaptation, again titled &quot;Koto&quot;, was directed by Yuki Saito and released in 2016.

<doc id="374927" wikidata="Q758034" url="?curid=374927" title="Attica Correctional Facility">
<text>Attica Correctional Facility is a maximum security prison campus in the Town of Attica, New York, operated by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. It was constructed in the 1930s in response to earlier riots within the New York state prisons.

A CS gas system (chlorobenzylidine malononitrile) installed in the mess hall and industry areas has been used to quell conflicts in these areas. The prison now holds numerous inmates who are serving various types of sentences (short-term to life). They are often sent to this facility because of disciplinary problems in other facilities. The prison is a maximum security facility.

In 1984, immediately adjacent to the Attica prison, the construction of the Wyoming Correctional Facility was completed. The Wyoming prison is a medium security facility.

==Rebellion==

Attica was the site of a prison uprising in September 1971 in which inmates took control of the prison for several days. They were seeking to negotiate to improve conditions and treatment at the overcrowded prison. The uprising and subsequent retaking of the prison by the state resulted in 43 deaths and over 89 injuries. Police killed 39 people, ten of which included correctional officers and civilian employees who had been taken hostage. Three prisoners were killed by other inmates and one guard died later from injuries sustained during the initial uprising.

==Notable inmates==

<text>Marie-Joseph Blaise de Chénier (; 11 February 1764 – 10 January 1811) was a French poet, dramatist and politician of French and Greek origin.

==Biography==
The younger brother of André Chénier, Joseph Chénier was born at Constantinople, but brought up at Carcassonne. He was educated in Paris at the Collège de Navarre. Entering the army at seventeen, he left it two years afterwards; and at nineteen he produced &quot;Azémire&quot;, a two-act drama (acted in 1786), and &quot;Edgar, ou le page supposé&quot;, a comedy (acted in 1785), which both failed. His &quot;Charles IX&quot; was kept back for nearly two years by the censor. Chénier attacked the censorship in three pamphlets, and the commotion aroused by the controversy raised keen interest in the piece. When it was at last produced on 4 November 1789 it was an immense success, due in part to its political suggestion, and in part to François Joseph Talma&#x27;s magnificent portrayal of King Charles IX of France.

Camille Desmoulins said that the piece had done more for the French Revolution than the days of October, and a contemporary memoir-writer, the marquis de Ferrire, says that the audience came away &quot;ivre de vengeance et du tourment d&#x27;un soir de sang&quot; (&quot;drunk with the vengeance and torment of an evening of blood&quot;). The performance was the occasion of a split among the actors of the Comédie-Française, and the new theatre in the Palais Royal, established by the dissidents, was inaugurated with &quot;Henri VIII&quot; (1791), generally recognized as Chénier&#x27;s masterpiece; &quot;Jean Calas, ou l&#x27;école des juges&quot; (&quot;Jean Calas, or the judges&#x27; school&quot;) followed in the same year.

In 1792 he produced his &quot;Caïus Gracchus&quot;, which was even more revolutionary in tone than its predecessors. It was nevertheless proscribed in the next year at the instance of the Montagnard deputy Albitte, for the anti-anarchical hemistich &quot;Des lois et non du sang&quot; (&quot;Laws, and not blood&quot;); &quot;Fénelon&quot; (1793) was suspended after a few representations; and in 1794 &quot;Timoléon&quot;, set to Etienne Méhul&#x27;s music, was also proscribed. This piece was played after the Reign of Terror, but the fratricide of &quot;Timoléon&quot; became the text for insinuations to the effect that by his silence Joseph Chénier had connived at the judicial murder of his brother, André, whom Joseph&#x27;s enemies alluded to as Abel.

In fact, after some fruitless attempts to save his brother, variously related by his biographers, Joseph became aware that André&#x27;s only chance of safety lay in being forgotten by the authorities, and that ill-advised intervention would only hasten the end. Joseph Chénier had been a member of the National Convention and had voted for the death of Louis XVI; he belonged to the committees of general security, and of public safety. He was, nevertheless, suspected of moderate sentiments, and before the end of the Terror had become a marked man.

He had a seat in the Council of Five Hundred, and the tribunat. In 1801 he was one of the educational jury for the Seine &quot;département&quot;. His political career ended in 1802, when he was eliminated with others from the tribunate for his opposition to Napoleon Bonaparte. From 1803 to 1806 he was inspector-general of public instruction. He had allowed himself to be reconciled with Napoleon&#x27;s government, and &quot;Cyrus&quot;, represented in 1804, was written in his honour, but he was temporarily disgraced in 1806 for his &quot;Épître à Voltaire&quot;. In 1806 and 1807 he delivered a course of lectures at the Athéne on the language and literature of France from the earliest years; and in 1808 at the emperor&#x27;s request, he prepared his &quot;Tableau historique de l&#x27;état et du progrés de la littérature française depuis 1789 jusqu&#x27;à 1808&quot; (&quot;Historical view of the state and progress of French literature from 1789 to 1808&quot;), a book containing some good criticism, though marred by the violent prejudices of its author.

The list of his works includes hymns and national songs among others, the famous &quot;Chant du départ&quot;; odes, &quot;Sur la mort de Mirabeau&quot;, &quot;Sur l&#x27;oligarchie de Robespierre&quot;, etc.; tragedies which never reached the stage, &quot;Brutus et Cassius&quot;, &quot;Philippe deux&quot;, &quot;Tibère&quot;; translations from Sophocles and Lessing, from Thomas Gray and Horace, from Tacitus and Aristotle; with elegies, dithyrambics and Ossianic rhapsodies. As a satirist he possessed great merit, though he sins from an excess of severity, and is sometimes malignant and unjust. He is the chief tragic poet of the revolutionary period, and as Camille Desmoulins expressed it, he decorated Melpomene with the tricolour cockade.

<text>The Opel Vectra is a mid-size car (large family car) that was engineered and produced by the German automaker Opel from 1988 until 2010. Available in saloon, hatchback and estate (from model year 1997 onwards) body styles, the Vectra was also sold by the Vauxhall marque in the United Kingdom as the Vauxhall Cavalier from 1988 to 1995 and then as the Vauxhall Vectra from 1995 to 2008, and it was also sold by Holden in Australia as the Holden Vectra, by Chevrolet in Latin America as the Chevrolet Vectra.

The Vectra was introduced in October 1988 as a replacement for the Opel Ascona, and was itself replaced in November 2008 by the new Opel Insignia, the nameplate spanning three generations and almost twenty-one years.


== Vectra A (1988–1995) ==

The first generation Vectra, known as the Vectra A, was introduced in October 1988 for the 1989 model year, as a four-door notchback saloon, replacing the Opel Ascona C. A five-door hatchback version arrived in March 1989, and a coupé based on the Vectra, called the Calibra, was introduced in the end of that year. Both cars were designed by Wayne Cherry, Opel’s design chief at the time. The Vectra name was coined by Manfred Gotta.

Vauxhall Motors, the British GM subsidiary that shared most of its models with Opel, did not use the &quot;Vectra&quot; model name - opting instead to continue the use of the Cavalier nameplate - effectively making the Vectra A a third-generation Cavalier when carrying Vauxhall branding. It was not until the introduction of the Vectra B into the United Kingdom in October 1995 that the Cavalier name was retired in favour of Vectra. However, left hand drive Opel Vectras were produced at Vauxhall&#x27;s Luton plant for export to other European countries.

The 1989 Vectra came in Base, LS, GL, GLS, CD, and GT models, its sister model was the third-generation Cavalier. Engines ranged initially from a 1.4 L to a 2.0 L Family II. The top-of-the-line Vectra 2000 16V arrived in September 1989. Its sixteen valve version of the 2.0 L engine produces and was only available with the sedan bodywork, with available four-wheel drive.

The sixteen-valve engine also appeared in GT (GSi in some markets) models after the facelift, now mainly as a hatchback. Two four-wheel drive versions were added to the lineup in January 1989, with either of the 2-litre engines, and in September 1992 the car received a limited edition turbocharged version with . In , the 4x4 turbo version of the Vectra was used as the Safety Car in Formula One.

Most notably, it was deployed at the San Marino Grand Prix.

The 1.4-litre engine was not available in all markets, and even then, it was generally only available in basic trims (Base/L in United Kingdom, LS/GL in Europe). In markets as Italy, where smaller engines were favored by the taxation system, a better equipped 1.4 GLS was also offered. With the introduction of Euro I emissions regulations, the 1.4 was replaced by a 1.6 L with the same output for most markets.

A 2.5 L V6 engine appeared towards the later stages of the Vectra&#x27;s life, developing 170 PS (125 kW), turning the car into a relaxed motorway cruiser rather than giving it sporty pretensions. There were a choice of two diesel engines; one was an Isuzu 1.7 L 4EE1 inline-four unit, in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged form (1686 cc), this one capable of achieving , and an Opel designed 1.7 &quot;low blow&quot; turbodiesel (1699 cc), and naturally aspirated diesel unit, delivering .

The front suspension was fully independent, with MacPherson struts, pressed steel lower control arms, and an anti-roll bar. The front suspension, together with the major mechanicals (engine and transmission) is remotely mounted on a front subframe. On front wheel drive models, the rear suspension is semi independent, consisting of a torsion beam linked to trailing arms, with double conical coil springs and direct acting telescopic hydraulic shock absorbers, with certain models also having an anti roll bar.

On the four wheel drive GSi, 4x4 and Turbo models, the rear suspension is a subframe mounted fully independent design, with semi trailing arms, double conical coil springs, direct acting gas assisted telescopic shock absorbers, and an anti roll bar. Steering gear is a rack and pinion-type (manual or power assisted, depending on model), mounted on the bulkhead (firewall), with a telescopically deformable steering column.

===Facelift (1992)===
The Vectra also received a refresh in September 1992. The range received new front grilles and a black plastic strip above the rear taillamps, along with an upgrade to the structure for improved crashworthiness. Airbags became available onwards from 1993.


In New Zealand, the Vectra A was offered initially as an Opel between 1989 and 1994, but it wore Holden badges between 1994 and 1996 until the introduction of the Vectra B. It was not sold in Australia, where Holden instead offered a rebadged Toyota Camry called Apollo until 1997. In Japan, the Vectra (and Omega) were the first Opels to be distributed by Isuzu Motors Ltd. rather than long standing importer Toho Motors (東邦モーターズ), beginning in July 1989.

In Egypt, the Opel Vectra A was not introduced until 1994 through GM Egypt dealerships, and started production in the end of 1994 by GM Egypt through the beginning of 1996, with a range of 1.6 GL, 2.0 GL trim and 2.0 GLS trim and only Saloon body style boosting strong sales during this short run. This was similar to the Opel Kadett.

===Chevrolet Vectra (Brazil)===
In Brazil, the Chevrolet badged Vectra A was not introduced until 1993, when it replaced the top versions of Chevrolet Monza, a restyled version of the Ascona C. The first Brazilian model had two engine options: 2.0 8 valve, for the GLS and CD versions and the 2.0 16 valve with 150 hp imported from Germany, the later only available for the GSI version. The assembly of the Vectra A goes until 1996, when the Vectra B was launched. Its production was made from CKD.

=== Engines ===
== Vectra B (1995–2002) ==

The second model, the Vectra B, was introduced in October 1995 for the 1996 model year, at the Frankfurt Motor Show, and the model range came to include an estate version for the first time. This model replaced the Vauxhall Cavalier in the United Kingdom. The five-door estate version premiered in September 1996, with the tagline ‘One step ahead of the Mob’.

The Vauxhall badged Vectra B was the last Vauxhall to be produced at the company&#x27;s Luton plant, where the end of automobile production was announced in December 2000, taking effect just over a year later. Car production at the site finished in March 2002, although production of commercial vehicles continued.

Engines started from the 75 PS (55 kW) 1.6 L, Family 1 but eventually the 8-valve engines were all replaced by 16-valve powerplants. The 2.0 L Family II engine, with 136 PS (100 kW) was developed as a basis for touring car racing (later in Australia, 2.2 L 108 kW), but the top of the line was a 2.5 L V6 with 170 PS (125 kW).

Diesel power came once again from Isuzu, with 1.7 liters and 82 PS, also a 2.0 L Ecotec with either 82 PS or 101 PS and 2.2 L Ecotec with 125 PS. In 2001, the all new 2.2 L petrol engine, as carried over to the Vectra C, was introduced with the 2.5 L petrol in its last incarnation being upgraded to a 2.6 L to accommodate emissions improvements. In April 1999, the Vectra was updated, receiving a mildly modified body (that can be identified by the single piece headlight units and body coloured bumpers) together with somewhat improved handling and better equipment.

Sporting limited edition models included the touring car championship inspired i500, ST200, Super Touring and GSi. The first model was developed in Germany by Opel Motorsport, with the V6 engine&#x27;s power increased to 195 PS (143 kW). 

The ST200 was a limited run car development and built by MSD in Milton Keynes with upgrades over the GSI including AP Racing 4 Pot Calipers and 325mm discs, AP Racing Suretrac LSD, lower final drive, KONI suspension, Speedline wheels and Recaro seat. Power was increased to 200 PS (146 kW). Only 38 ST200s were produced.

The ST200 was based on the GSI which was also developed by MSD.

The Supertouring was a limited edition trim level based on the Vectra SRi. It was available in only three colours - white, black or red. Two engines were offered - the 2.0 16v with 136bhp or the 170bhp 2.5 V6, with an Irmscher sports exhaust system and white 16-inch alloys and GSi front bumpers. 

Only 3,900 2.5 GSi models were ever produced, mostly in saloon and hatchback guise. With only 317 estate versions produced during this time, they became one of the rarest production Vauxhalls ever.

On the 2001 and 2002 model years, a last of the line 2.6 GSi was made also but these were limited to five hundred cars. These were again mostly saloons and hatchbacks, however 37 estates were made. These models received a host of extra upgrades, including to Xenon headlamps, and larger front brakes.

In October 2013, &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine placed the 1995 Vectra on its list of &quot;The 13 Worst Cars Of The Last 20 Years&quot;, describing the car as &quot;so mediocre that Jeremy Clarkson refused to drive it.&quot;

Production of the Vectra B ended in March 2002.

===International production===

;Egypt
In Egypt, the production of the Opel Vectra B commenced during 1996 with two models, initially in GLS trim with a 1.6-litre, 8v engine and a manual transmission, or in CD trim with a 8-valve, 2.0-litre with automatic transmission.

Later in 2000, the revised model was produced with three models: 1.6 (8v) GLS with manual transmission, later replaced by the 1.6 16v GLS trim with automatic transmission, 2.0 16v CD with automatic transmission, and a 2.0 CDX trim (also automatic). Only the saloon body style was offered. In 2002, local production of the Opel Vectra ceased in favour of the Corsa saloon and Astra saloon.

;North America
A related model sold in North America was the Saturn L-Series, introduced in 2000, but dropped from the line up in 2005. It was replaced by the 2007 Saturn Aura, which was built around GM&#x27;s Epsilon architecture, shared with the Vectra C.

;South America
The release of the second generation of the Chevrolet Vectra happened at the same time that the IndyCar series in Brazil, GM made a deal to use the Vectra as a Medical and Safety car for the race. The Vectra B came with the already available 2.0 8-valve engine with on the GL and GLS versions and a national version of the previously 2.0 16 valve with for the CD version.

In 1998, GM introduced a new, torquier 2.2-litre 8 valve engine with for the GL and GLS, and a 16 valve version of the same with and for the CD version.

A facelift was done for the 2000 models, just like the European version. Production ran until 2005, when it was replaced by the new generation Vectra, based on the Opel Astra H Sedan. The Vectra was only offered in a 4-door saloon body in both generations (A &amp; B).


== Vectra C (2002–2010) ==

Built on the new GM Epsilon platform, the Opel Vectra C, released in March 2002 for the 2003 model year was initially available as a four-door notchback saloon and a five-door hatchback, known as the GTS. A five-door estate was added in October 2003. The Vectra C&#x27;s official debut was at the 2002 Geneva Motor Show.

Originally, the Vectra C was due to début with the Saab 9-3 in October 2001, at the Frankfurt Motor Show, but in July 2001, it was announced that delays had forced General Motors to postpone the introduction. The hatchback version premiered in September 2002. The four door notchback saloon version of the Vectra C almost resembled a two-box four door fastback saloon. While the earlier Cavalier and Vectras had been built at the company&#x27;s Luton plant, the second generation Vauxhall Vectra was built at the Ellesmere Port plant from the introduction. Pilot production at Ellesmere Port started in late 2001.

The Vectra C was first seen in November 1999, in a copy of &quot;Auto Express&quot;. At the Frankfurt Motor Show in October 2003, the estate version premièred, which had a slightly longer wheelbase than the hatchback and saloon versions. Sharing the wheelbase of the estate, an &quot;executive hatchback&quot; sold under the Opel/Vauxhall Signum nameplate. The Signum, which was based partly on the Vectra C, featured a completely different layout in the rear.

The engine range was substantially modified to account for the increased curb weight of the Vectra C. The 1.8 litre &quot;Family 1 Ecotec&quot; engine was reserved for the base model, with the main petrol engine for the Vectra C, making up the vast bulk of production, being the Ecotec 2.2 litre chain driven unit producing ; along with a new range topping 3.2 litre &quot;54-Degree&quot; V6, with . From June to July 2002, Ed Harris starred in adverts for the Vauxhall Vectra in the United Kingdom. Pierluigi Collina also starred in adverts across Europe for the Vectra, as well as the Signum, in the end of 2005.

In 2003, a 2.0 litre turbocharged &quot;Ecotec&quot; engine with was also notionally offered. Being a main engine for another GM brand, Saab, it was only ever sold in small numbers in the Vectra. The 2.2 litre was upgraded in 2004, with the &#x27;Direct&#x27; name added to the model line, indicating the new high pressure direct injection update that increased power output to with improved emissions.

Diesel power, which had become important for commercial success in Europe, was provided by CDTI 1.9, 2.0 and 2.2 engines, with a top of the range Isuzu sourced 3.0 litre &quot;DMAX&quot; V6 outputting .

In October 2004, the four cylinder diesel engine was replaced with a Fiat designed 1.9 litre Ecotec CDTI engine capable of producing in 8v form and in 16v form. Handling was reported to be much better than the previous Vectra.

The Vectra C received a facelift in September 2005, with the début at the Frankfurt Motor Show, and it retained a similar line of engines. However, the power of the 3.0 diesel was increased to , and the petrol 3.2 litre V6 engine was replaced by an Australian built turbocharged 2.8 litre &quot;High Feature&quot; V6 unit. This Saab co-developed motor could produce . Opel installed the twin scroll turbo engine in its Signum productline with output.

The version was available for the Vectra later in 2006. Opel also introduced – for the first time – an OPC version of the Vectra, using the VXR name in the United Kingdom. These high performance variants were only available as hatchbacks and estates. In the United Kingdom the power of the &quot;High Feature&quot; V6 engine was increased to , giving a maximum speed approaching 250 km/h (155 mph).

Production of the Vectra C and Signum ended in July 2008.

The Vectra C was branded as the Holden Vectra in Australia and New Zealand. Between 1998 and 2001, Holden in Australia assembled the Vectra for export to other RHD markets in the region, with a view to exporting 60 per cent of output, although this was adversely affected by the Asian economic crisis.

Locally designated the &quot;ZC&quot; series and launched in March 2003, the Vectra C was only available as a sedan and hatchback. Holden did not offer the Vectra C estate due to the presence of the Astra and later Holden Viva (Daewoo Lacetti) estates. The Vectra was dropped and replaced by the Holden Epica, a badge engineered Daewoo Tosca early in 2007.

Due to stockpiling of Vectras from 2005 for the market in Australasia, there was enough supply of the car for deliveries to last through to 2007. As a result, facelifted Vectra Cs were not sold in those markets. In 2008, the Vectra OPC was available with either six speed manual or six speed automatic transmission (Previous Vectra OPC had manual gearbox only). The 2.8L DOHC V6 turbo engine could generate .

;United Kingdom

Sales of the Vectra C in the United Kingdom were not as strong as those of its predecessors. For much of its production life, the original Vectra was the fourth best selling car in the country, but the Vectra C never came higher than tenth in the country&#x27;s car sales charts, though within its own market sector it held on to second place, behind the Ford Mondeo.

In 2007, it finally made the Top 10 of Britain&#x27;s car sales charts, being the nation&#x27;s tenth most popular new car with over 50,000 sales, outselling the Ford Mondeo for the first time since 1999. Also, in January 2007, the estate variant was awarded &quot;Estate Car of the Year 2007&quot;, by &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine.

;South America

While the Vectra C was sold in Mexico and Chile as the Chevrolet Vectra, it was not marketed in Brazil, where Chevrolet opted to sell the Astra H under the Vectra brand from 2006 to 2011. Both local spec cars were powered by the FlexPower SOHC engine originally introduced in 1982 in the Chevrolet Monza.

;Ireland

In Ireland, the Vectra C was produced until February 2010.


==Chevrolet Vectra D (2009–2012)==
The Chevrolet Vectra D is the rebadged Opel Insignia available only in the Chilean market. It is a very rare model of Chevrolet in Chile, with not many found. In June 2013, it was renamed the Opel Insignia along with a facelift, as the Chevrolet brand was being phased out in that market. In February 2017, Opel was sold to the PSA Group.

The Vectra was used in several touring car racing series.

In the 1990s and the early 2000s the Vectra B Super Touring took part in the British Touring Car Championship, the Asia-Pacific Touring Car Championship, the German Super Tourenwagen Cup, the Australian Super Touring Championship, the Japanese Touring Car Championship, the Italian Superturismo Championship, the French Supertouring Championship and the Swedish Touring Car Championship.

Uwe Alzen was third in Super Tourenwagen Cup in 1997 and 1998, and second in 1999; John Henderson was runner up in the 2000 Australian Super Touring Championship; John Cleland was British Touring Car Champion in 1995 and finished third in 1992 and fourth in 1993 and 1994; Yvan Muller was sixth in the 1999 British Touring Car Championship and fourth in 2000; and Nicklas Karlsson was third in the 2002 Swedish Touring Car Championship.

A prototype Vectra C was built to the BTC Touring specifications in 2003 by Triple Eight Race Engineering, with the view to using it in the 2004 BTCC, but it was never raced, despite being shown publicly at the 2004 Birmingham Motor Show as the &#x27;Vectra Diesel Concept&#x27;.

After being replaced by the Astra H in the British Touring Car Championship, the Vauxhall Vectra was introduced in 2007. Fabrizio Giovanardi was champion in 2007 and 2008. VX Racing competed in the season of 2009, with three Vectras, driven by Giovanardi, Matt Neal and Andrew Jordan.

The Vectra has been used as a silhouette racing car: in the Stock Car Brasil in 2000 to 2003 (it was the champion for four seasons) and 2009, in the Argentine Top Race V6 since 2005 (Guillermo Ortelli was 2005 champion), and in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters in 2004 and 2005, with little success.

In 1994, a Vectra A was the official Formula 1 safety car during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix driven by Max Angelelli at the time and was in front of Ayrton Senna for 5 laps before he crashed into Tamburello on lap 7.

==Early life and family==
Abel Smith was born in London on 8 March 1900, the eldest son of Lieutenant Colonel Francis Abel Smith (1861–1908) of Wilford House, Nottinghamshire, and of Coleorton Hall, Leicestershire, and of Selsdon Park, a descendant of the prominent banking Smith family founded by Abel Smith (1717–1788), by his wife Madeline S Maur Seymour (1862–1951), a descendant of Edward Seymour, 8th Duke of Somerset.

His grandparents were Henry Abel Smith (1826–1890) and Elizabeth Mary Pym (1826–1877), a daughter of Francis Pym (1790–1860) and Lady Lucy Leslie-Meville (1796–1848), a daughter of Alexander Leslie-Melville, 9th Earl of Leven. His younger brother was Brigadier Sir Alexander Abel Smith (1904–1980), whose second wife was Henriette Alice Cadogan (d.2005), a descendant of the 4th Earl Cadogan, who between 1949 and 1987 served as a lady-in-waiting to Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II).

==Career==
Abel Smith attended Eton College and subsequently the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where on 17 December 1919 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Horse Guards. Promoted on 17 December 1921 to lieutenant, between 1928 and 1930 he served as aide-de-camp (ADC) to Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, whose daughter he later married. He was promoted to captain on 1 February 1930 and major on 26 June 1934.

Abel Smith served in the Second World War, where from 1941 to 1945 he commanded the 2nd Household Cavalry Regiment, leading it throughout the entire North West Europe Campaign from June 1944 shortly after D-Day to Victory in Europe Day in May 1945. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in February 1945. In 1944 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and in 1946 colonel. He retired as a colonel in 1950. In 1953 he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Berkshire. On 18 March 1958 Abel Smith was appointed Governor of Queensland in Australia and served in that office until 18 March 1966.

<text>Acetobacter is a genus of acetic acid bacteria. Acetic acid bacteria are characterized by the ability to convert ethanol to acetic acid in the presence of oxygen. Of these, the genus &quot;Acetobacter&quot; is distinguished by the ability to oxidize lactate and acetate into carbon dioxide and water. Bacteria of the genus &quot;Acetobacter&quot; have been isolated from industrial vinegar fermentation processes and are frequently used as fermentation starter cultures.

== History of research ==
The acetic fermentation was demonstrated by Louis Pasteur, who discovered the first acetobacter - &quot;Acetobacter aceti&quot; - in 1864.

In 1998, two strains of &quot;Acetobacter&quot; isolated from red wine and cider vinegar were named &quot;Acetobacter oboediens&quot; and &quot;Acetobacter pomorum&quot;.

In 2000, &quot;Acetobacter oboediens&quot; and &quot;Acetobacter intermedius&quot; were transferred to &quot;Gluconacetobacter&quot; on the basis of 16S rRNA sequencing.

In 2002, &quot;Acetobacter cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;Acetobacter malorum&quot; were identified by 16S rRNA sequence analysis of &quot;Acetobacter&quot; strains.

In 2006, a strain of &quot;Acetobacter&quot; isolated from spoiled red wine was named &quot;Acetobacter oeni&quot;.

== Microbiota ==
The genus &quot;Acetobacter&quot; contains species which are important commensal bacteria in the gut microbiome of &quot;Drosophila melanogaster.&quot; The species &quot;A. pomorum&quot; specifically helps uphold the physiology and development of &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; through insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling.

<text>The Ruskin Pottery was an English art pottery studio founded in 1898 by Edward R. Taylor, the first principal of both the Lincoln School of Art and the Birmingham School of Art, to be run by his son, William Howson Taylor, formerly a student there. It was named after the artist, writer and social thinker John Ruskin, as the Taylors agreed with, and followed the tenets of Ruskin. The pottery was situated at 173-174 Oldbury Road, Smethwick, then in Staffordshire (now part of Sandwell, in the West Midlands county).

The pottery produced was notable for the innovative glazes used on a range of brightly coloured pots, vases, buttons, bowls, tea services and jewellery. The ceramic glazes devised by William Howson Taylor included misty soufflé glazes, ice crystal effect glazes - &#x27;crystalline&#x27;, lustre glazes resembling metallic finishes, and the most highly regarded of all, &quot;sang-de-boeuf&quot; and flambé glazes which produced a blood red effect. The sang-de-boeuf glazes were created using reduction of copper and iron oxides at high temperature. This was a difficult technique, first developed in China in the 13th century and reinvented by several art potters in Europe in the late 19th century. William Howson Taylor was one of the principal exponents of &#x27;high fired&#x27; techniques, producing a range of colours and unique &#x27;fissured&#x27; glaze effects.

Having exhibited at home and at international fine art exhibitions, the award of a &quot;grand prize&quot; in 1904 at the St Louis International Exhibition, gave them the recognition they needed. Further awards were gained at other international exhibitions, including Milan 1906; Christchurch, New Zealand, 1907; London 1908; Brussels 1910; Turin 1911; Ghent 1913.
When the studio closed in 1935 the formulae for the glazes and all the pottery documentation were deliberately destroyed, so that the unique Ruskin products could never be replicated.

A large collection of Ruskin Pottery is on public display at Wednesbury Museum and Art Gallery, Wednesbury, about north of the factory. The collection is owned by Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council and is managed by Sandwell Museum Service.

The site of the factory is now an industrial estate, &quot;Ruskin Place&quot;. A blue plaque marking the site, erected by the Smethwick Local History Society, was subsequently stolen.
