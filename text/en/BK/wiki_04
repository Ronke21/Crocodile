<text>Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III (born December 24, 1946) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 84th United States attorney general from 2017 to 2018. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as United States senator from Alabama from 1997 to 2017 before resigning that position to serve as attorney general in the first administration of President Donald Trump. Trump fired Sessions in 2018 due to his inaction and recusal from the Russian collusion probes.

From 1981 to 1993, Sessions served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan nominated Sessions to a judgeship on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. After allegations of racism were made against him in testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, which Sessions denied, the committee voted against advancing his nomination to the Senate floor; the nomination was later withdrawn. Sessions was elected attorney general of Alabama in 1994. In 1996, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, and was re-elected in 2002, 2008 and 2014. During his Senate tenure, Sessions was considered one of the most conservative senators. His Senate voting record includes votes against comprehensive immigration reform (2006), the 2008 bank bailout, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Affordable Care Act (2009) and criminal justice reform (2015).

Sessions was an early supporter of Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign; he was nominated by Trump for the post of U.S. Attorney General. He was confirmed and sworn in as attorney general in February 2017. In his confirmation hearings, Sessions stated under oath that he did not have contact with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign and that he was unaware of any contact between Trump campaign members and Russian officials. However, in March 2017, news reports revealed that Sessions had twice met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in 2016. Sessions later recused himself from any investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. As attorney general, Sessions rescinded a memo issued by one of his predecessors, Eric Holder, that had sought to curb mass incarceration by avoiding mandatory sentencing for drug crimes; he ordered federal prosecutors to begin seeking the maximum criminal charges possible. A staunch opponent of illegal immigration, Sessions adopted a hard line on sanctuary cities and told reporters that cities failing to comply with federal immigration policy would lose federal funding. He also played a key role in the implementation of the Trump administration family separation policy. Trump issued an executive order revoking the cities&#x27; funding, but that order was overturned by a federal court. Sessions also supported Department of Justice prosecutions of medical marijuana providers.

On November 7, 2018, Sessions tendered his resignation at Trump&#x27;s request following months of public and private conflict with President Trump over his recusal from investigations relating to Russian election interference. Sessions ran in the 2020 Senate election in Alabama to reclaim his old seat, but lost in the Republican primary to Tommy Tuberville, who was supported by President Trump.

== Early life and early career ==
Sessions was born in Selma, Alabama, on December 24, 1946, the son of Jefferson Beauregard Sessions Jr. and the former Abbie Powe. Sessions, his father, and his grandfather were named after Jefferson Davis, a U.S. senator and president of the Confederate States of America, and P. G. T. Beauregard, a veteran of the Mexican–American War and a Confederate general who oversaw the Battle of Fort Sumter that commenced the American Civil War. His father owned a general store in Hybart, Alabama, and later owned a farm equipment dealership. Both Sessions&#x27;s parents were primarily of English descent, with some Scots-Irish ancestry. In 1964, Sessions became an Eagle Scout, and later, he earned the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award for his many years of service.

After attending Wilcox County High School in nearby Camden, Sessions studied at Huntingdon College in Montgomery, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1969. He was active in the Young Republicans, the marching band and was student body president. Sessions attended the University of Alabama School of Law and graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1973.

Sessions entered the private practice of law in Russellville and later in Mobile. He also served in the Army Reserve in the 1970s with the rank of captain.

== U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama (1981–1993) ==

Sessions served as an assistant United States attorney in the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama beginning in 1975. In 1981, President Reagan nominated him to be the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama. The Senate confirmed him and he held that position for twelve years. In 1993, Sessions resigned his post after Democrat Bill Clinton was elected President of the United States.

Sessions&#x27;s office filed civil rights charges in the 1981 killing of Michael Donald, a young African American man who was murdered in Mobile, Alabama, by a pair of Ku Klux Klan members. Sessions&#x27;s office did not prosecute the case, as homicide is prosecuted by the state government, but both men were arrested and convicted.

In 1985, Sessions prosecuted three African American community organizers in the Black Belt of Alabama, including Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s former aide Albert Turner, for voter fraud, alleging tampering with 14 absentee ballots. The prosecution stirred charges of selective prosecution of black voter registration. The defendants, known as the Marion Three, were acquitted of all charges by a jury after three hours of deliberation. Historian Wayne Flynt told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; he regarded concerns about tactics employed in the 1984 election and by Turner in particular as legitimate, but also noted Sessions had no history of advocating for black voter rights before 1984. Interviewed in 2009, Sessions said he remained convinced that he did the right thing, but admitted he &quot;failed to make the case&quot;.

== Failed nomination for federal trial court judgeship (1986) ==

In 1986, Reagan nominated Sessions to be a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama. Sessions&#x27;s judicial nomination was recommended and actively backed by Republican Alabama senator Jeremiah Denton. A substantial majority of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which rates nominees to the federal bench, rated Sessions &quot;qualified&quot;, with a minority voting that Sessions was &quot;not qualified&quot;. His nomination was opposed by the NAACP, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and People for the American Way.

At Sessions&#x27;s confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, four Department of Justice lawyers who had worked with Sessions testified that he made racially offensive remarks. One of those lawyers, J. Gerald Hebert, testified that Sessions had referred to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) as &quot;un-American&quot; and &quot;Communist-inspired&quot; (Sessions said he was referring to their support of the Sandinistas) and that they did more harm than good by trying to force civil rights &quot;down the throats of people&quot;. Hebert, a civil rights lawyer, said that he did not consider Sessions a racist, and that Sessions &quot;has a tendency sometimes to just say something, and I believe these comments were along that vein.&quot; Hebert also said that Sessions had called a white civil rights attorney &quot;maybe&quot; a &quot;disgrace to his race&quot;. Sessions said he did not recall making that remark and he did not believe it.

Thomas Figures, a black assistant U.S. attorney, testified that Sessions said he thought the Ku Klux Klan was &quot;OK until I found out they smoked pot&quot;. Sessions later said that the comment was not serious, but did apologize for it, saying that he considered the Klan to be &quot;a force for hatred and bigotry&quot;. Barry Kowalski, a prosecutor in the civil rights division, also heard the remark and testified that prosecutors working such a gruesome case sometimes &quot;resort to operating room humor and that is what I considered it to be&quot;. Another DOJ lawyer, Albert Glenn, said, &quot;It never occurred to me that there was any seriousness to it.&quot; Figures testified that on one occasion, when the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division sent the office instructions to investigate a case that Sessions had tried to close, Figures and Sessions &quot;had a very spirited discussion regarding how the Hodge case should then be handled; in the course of that argument, Mr. Sessions threw the file on a table, and remarked, &#x27;I wish I could decline on all of them, by which Figures said Sessions meant civil rights cases generally. Kowalski, however, testified that he believed &quot;[Sessions] was eager to see that justice was done in the area of criminal civil rights prosecutions.&quot;

Figures also said that Sessions had called him &quot;boy&quot;, which Sessions denied. Figures testified that two assistant prosecutors had also heard Sessions, including current federal judge Ginny Granade. Granade denied this. He also testified that &quot;Mr. Sessions admonished me to &#x27;be careful what you say to white folks.&#x27;&quot; Sessions denied this. In 1992, Figures was charged with attempting to bribe a witness by offering $50,000 to a convicted drug dealer who was to testify against his client. Figures claimed the charge was retaliation for his role in blocking the Sessions nomination. Sessions denied this, saying that he recused himself from the case. Figures was ultimately acquitted.

Hebert, Kowalski and Daniel Bell, deputy chief of the criminal section in the Civil Rights Division, testified that they considered Sessions to have been more welcoming to the work of the Civil Rights Division than many other Southern U.S. attorneys at the time. Sessions has always defended his civil rights record, saying that &quot;when I was [a U.S. attorney], I signed 10 pleadings attacking segregation or the remnants of segregation, where we as part of the Department of Justice, we sought desegregation remedies.&quot; Critics later argued that Sessions had exaggerated his involvement in civil rights cases. Michigan Law professor Samuel Bagenstos, reviewing Sessions&#x27;s claims, argued that &quot;[a]ll this shows is that Sessions didn&#x27;t completely refuse to participate in or have his name on pleadings in cases that the civil rights division brought during his tenure... These four cases are awfully weak evidence of Sessions&#x27;s supposed commitment to civil rights.&quot;

Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee to oppose the nomination. In her letter, she wrote that &quot;Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly black voters.&quot;

On June 5, 1986, the committee voted 10–8 against recommending the nomination to the Senate floor, with Republican senators Charles Mathias of Maryland and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania voting with the Democrats. It then split 9–9 on a vote to send Sessions&#x27;s nomination to the Senate floor with no recommendation, this time with Specter in support. A majority was required for the nomination to proceed. The pivotal votes against Sessions came from his home state&#x27;s Democratic senator Howell Heflin of Alabama. Although Heflin had previously backed Sessions, he began to oppose Sessions after hearing testimony, concluding that there were &quot;reasonable doubts&quot; over Sessions&#x27;s ability to be &quot;fair and impartial&quot;. The nomination was withdrawn on July 31, 1986.

Sessions became only the second nominee to the federal judiciary in 48 years whose nomination was killed by the Senate Judiciary Committee. He was quoted then as saying that the Senate on occasion had been insensitive to the rights and reputation of nominees. A law clerk from the U.S. District Court in Mobile who had worked with Sessions later acknowledged the confirmation controversy, but stated that he observed Sessions as &quot;a lawyer of the highest ethical and intellectual standards&quot;.

When Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania left the GOP to join the Democratic Party on April 28, 2009, Sessions was selected to be the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee. At that time, Specter said that his vote against Sessions&#x27;s 1986 federal judicial nomination had been a mistake, adding that he had later found Sen. Sessions to be an &quot;egalitarian&quot;.

== Alabama attorney general (1995–1997) ==
Sessions was elected attorney general of Alabama in November 1994, unseating incumbent Democrat Jimmy Evans with 57% of the vote. The harsh criticism he had received from Senator Ted Kennedy, who called him a &quot;throw-back to a shameful era&quot; and a &quot;disgrace&quot;, was considered to have won him the support of Alabama conservatives.

As attorney general, Sessions defended the state in a litigation that challenged the funding system for Alabama&#x27;s public schools. The litigation resulted in the creation of a new funding system after &quot;Judge Eugene W. Reese found the state&#x27;s education funding unconstitutional and ordered lawmakers to come up with a system to remedy inequities between rich and poor schools.&quot;

As attorney general in 1995, Sessions defended a newly passed state law denying access to meeting space and student group funding for Gay-Straight Alliances at the state&#x27;s public universities, stating that &quot;an organization that professes to be homosexuals and/or lesbians may not receive state funding or use state-supported facilities to foster or promote those illegal, sexually deviate activities defined in the sodomy and sexual misconduct laws.&quot; The U.S. District court ruled against the state law as a violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in &quot;Gay Lesbian Bisexual Alliance v. Sessions&quot;, 917 F. Supp. 1548 (1996).

== U.S. Senate (1997–2017) ==
In 1996, Sessions won the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, after a runoff, and then defeated Democrat Roger Bedford 53%–46% in the November general election. He succeeded Howell Heflin (a Democrat), who had retired after 18 years in the Senate, making his victory a Republican pickup in the Senate.

In the February 1999 impeachment trial, Sessions voted to convict President Bill Clinton on both articles of impeachment, for perjury and obstruction of justice. However Clinton was acquitted on both charges by the Senate.

Following the Columbine High School massacre in April 1999, Sessions took part in the Senate&#x27;s Subcommittee that investigated the massacre. Sessions blamed violent video games, movies and music, especially that of Marilyn Manson, and parts of culture for the actions of the two shooters.
In 2002, Sessions won reelection by defeating Democratic state auditor Susan Parker. In 2008, Sessions defeated Democratic state senator Vivian Davis Figures (sister-in-law of Thomas Figures, the assistant U.S. attorney who testified at Sessions&#x27;s judicial confirmation hearing) to win a third term. Sessions received 63 percent of the vote to Figures&#x27;s 37 percent. Sessions successfully sought a fourth term in 2014. In 2014, Sessions was uncontested in the Republican primary and was only opposed in the general election by write-in Democratic candidate Victor Sanchez Williams.

Sessions was only the second freshman Republican senator from Alabama since Reconstruction and gave Alabama two Republican senators, a first since Reconstruction. In 2002, he became the first Republican reelected to the Senate from Alabama since Reconstruction (given that his colleague Richard Shelby, who won reelection as a Republican in 1998, had previously run as a Democrat, switching parties in 1994).

Sessions was the ranking Republican member on the Senate Budget Committee, a former ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a senior member of the Armed Services Committee. He also served on the Environment and Public Works Committee.

=== Campaign donors ===

According to OpenSecrets, between 1995 and 2016, Sessions&#x27;s largest donors came from the legal, health, real estate, and insurance industries. From 1995 to 2016, the corporations employing donors who gave the most to his campaign were the Southern Company utility firm, the Balch &amp; Bingham law firm, the Drummond Company coal mining firm, Collazo Enterprises, and Vulcan Materials.

=== 2016 presidential election ===
Sessions was an early supporter of the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump, and was a major policy adviser to the Trump campaign, especially in regard to immigration and national security. He was on the short list to become Trump&#x27;s running mate and was widely seen as a potential Cabinet secretary in a Trump administration.

Sessions donned a &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; cap at a Trump rally in August 2015, and Stephen Miller, Sessions&#x27;s long-time communications director, joined the Trump campaign. On February 28, 2016, Sessions officially endorsed Trump for president. Session&#x27;s endorsement further legitimized Trump&#x27;s campaign, as he was the first and only sitting U.S. Senator to endorse him during the primary. Sessions&#x27;s and Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s appearance was a staple at Trump campaign rallies. Uncorroborated Russian communications intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies discuss Ambassador Sergey Kislyak meeting privately with Sessions at the Mayflower Hotel during a Trump campaign event in April 2016.

==== Transition ====
During the transition, Sessions played a large role in appointments and policy preparation relative to space, NASA and related facilities in Alabama, while Peter Thiel advocated for private spaceflight.

== Attorney General of the United States (2017–2018) ==
=== Nomination and confirmation ===

President-elect Trump announced on November 18, 2016, that he would nominate Sessions to be Attorney General of the United States. Trump would later state in an August 22, 2018, interview with Fox News&#x27; Ainsley Earhardt that the only reason he nominated Sessions was because Sessions was an original supporter during his presidential campaign. The nomination engendered support and opposition from various groups and individuals. He was introduced by Senator Susan Collins from Maine who said, &quot;He&#x27;s a decent individual with a strong commitment to the rule of law. He&#x27;s a leader of integrity. I think the attacks against him are not well founded and are unfair.&quot; More than 1,400 law school professors wrote a letter urging the Senate to reject the nomination. A group of black pastors rallied in support of Sessions in advance of his confirmation hearing; his nomination was supported by Gerald A. Reynolds, an African American former chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Six NAACP activists, including NAACP President Cornell William Brooks, were arrested at a January 2017 sit-in protesting the nomination.

On January 10, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on his nomination began and were interrupted by protesters. The committee approved his nomination February1 on an 11–9 party-line vote. The nomination then went to the full Senate for a confirmation vote. The vote on Sessions was delayed until after the vote on Secretary of Education nominee Betsy DeVos, because his confirmationand subsequent resignation from the Senatewould create a temporary vacancy, which otherwise would have jeopardized DeVos&#x27;s narrow confirmation. On February 7, 2017, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stopped Senator Elizabeth Warren from reading statements opposing Sessions&#x27;s nomination as federal judge that had been made by Ted Kennedy and Coretta Scott King. Warren was then officially rebuked per Senate Rule XIX on a party-line vote for &quot;impugning a fellow senator&#x27;s character&quot;. In silencing Warren, McConnell uttered the phrase &quot;Nevertheless, she persisted&quot;; the phrase was later adopted by the feminist movement in referring to women&#x27;s persistence in breaking barriers. A few hours later Senator Jeff Merkley read without interruption the same letter by King that Warren had attempted to read.

On February 8, 2017, Sessions was confirmed as attorney general by a vote of 52 to 47. The next day, he was sworn in into his new post.

=== Tenure ===
On March 10, 2017, Sessions oversaw the firing of 46 United States attorneys. His acting deputy, Dana Boente, and Deputy Attorney General nominee Rod Rosenstein remained in place after Trump declined their resignations.

On April 10, 2017, Sessions disbanded the National Commission on Forensic Science and ended the department&#x27;s review of forensic accuracy in closed cases.

Sessions imposed a hiring freeze on most of the United States Department of Justice Criminal Division and U.S. attorneys&#x27; offices, and placed a total hiring freeze on the Department&#x27;s Fraud Section. On April 24, 2017, Sessions traveled to an ethics lawyers&#x27; conference to assure them the department would continue prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, regardless of Trump&#x27;s comments that the law is a &quot;horrible law&quot; and that &quot;the world is laughing at us&quot;.

On May 9, 2017, Sessions delivered a memo to the president recommending that Trump fire FBI director James Comey, attaching a memo by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein which called the Director&#x27;s behavior indefensible. Trump fired Comey that day. In March 2017, Sessions had recused himself from investigations into Russia&#x27;s interference in the 2016 presidential election. Comey was leading the investigations prior to his dismissal.

On June 5, 2017, Sessions issued a memo preventing the Justice Department&#x27;s future lawsuit settlements from including funding for third parties. Such settlement funding had been made available for the cleanup of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the Volkswagen emissions scandal.

In a November 2017 overview of his tenure in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Sessions was described as having made &quot;dramatic and controversial changes [which] reflect his nationalist ideology and hard-line views&quot;.

In a speech on 5 December 2017, Sessions described a multi-billion dollar corruption scandal involving a Malaysian state fund (1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal) as the worst form of kleptocracy, and said the DoJ was working to provide justice to the victims. He said: &quot;This is kleptocracy at its worst.&quot;

On December 21, 2017, Sessions rescinded 200 pages of guidance documents. Some of those 25 guidance documents had included warnings to avoid imposing excessive fees on the poor, to refrain from shipping some guns across state lines, and to encourage accommodation of the developmentally disabled. Sessions&#x27;s recessions were criticized by the United States Commission on Civil Rights and prompted a lawsuit by the City Attorney of San Francisco. In 2018, Sessions shuttered the Justice Department&#x27;s Office for Access to Justice, which had focused on legal aid.

On November 7, 2018, Sessions resigned at President Trump&#x27;s behest. It has been reported that his letter of resignation had also been submitted on a prior occasion.

==== Controversies about Russia ====

During Sessions&#x27;s Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on January 10, Senator Al Franken asked him what he would do as attorney general &quot;if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign&quot;. Franken was referring to a news report alleging that Russia had compromising material on Trump, and that Trump surrogates were in contact with the Russian government. Sessions replied that he was &quot;not aware of any of those activities&quot; and said &quot;I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn&#x27;t havedid not have communications with the Russians, and I&#x27;m unable to comment on it.&quot;

A week later, in his responses to written questions presented by Senator Patrick Leahy, Sessions stated that he had not been &quot;in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election&quot;.

On March 1, 2017, reports surfaced that Sessions had contact with Russian government officials during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, even though during his confirmation hearings he denied he had any discussions with representatives of the Russian government. News reports revealed that Sessions had spoken twice with Russia&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. The first communication took place after a Heritage Foundation event at the 2016 Republican National Convention attended by several ambassadors, including Kislyak who spoke with Sessions. The second interaction took place on September 8, 2016, when they met in Sessions&#x27;s office; Sessions said they discussed Ukraine and terrorism. Sessions released a statement on March 1, 2017, saying &quot;I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.&quot; U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said: &quot;There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer. He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaignnot about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee... Last year, the Senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian, German and Russian ambassadors.&quot;

Upon the revelation that Sessions had met twice with the Russian ambassador, Republican senator Lindsey Graham called for Sessions to recuse himself from any investigations into the connections between Russia and the Trump campaign. Several Democratic members of Congress called on Sessions to resign his post as United States attorney general. Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Elijah Cummings and Senator Al Franken accused Sessions of having lied under oath at his confirmation hearing.

On March 20, 2017, FBI director James Comey testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee that since July 2016, the FBI had been conducting a counter-intelligence investigation to assess the extent of Russia&#x27;s interference into the 2016 presidential election and whether Trump associates played a role in Russia&#x27;s efforts. In May 2017 the Justice Department reported that Sessions had failed to disclose meetings with Russian officials during the presidential campaign in 2016, when he applied for his security clearance. Sessions&#x27;s staff had been advised by the FBI that meetings with foreign dignitaries and their staff connected with his Senate activities did not need to be disclosed.

On June 13, 2017, Sessions testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee after canceling testimonies before the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Sessions rejected reports he had met with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during Trump&#x27;s April 2016 speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., testifying that he did not remember any &quot;brief interaction&quot; he may have had with the ambassador. Accused of &quot;stonewalling&quot; by Senator Ron Wyden, Sessions discussed the executive privilege power, and said that he was refusing to answer questions about his conversations with Trump because &quot;I am protecting the President&#x27;s right to assert it if he chooses.&quot; He was being advised by his personal lawyer Charles J. Cooper.

In July 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Kislyak, in communications intercepted by U.S. intelligence, had told his superiors in Moscow that his conversations with Sessions had concerned Trump&#x27;s campaign as well as &quot;Trump&#x27;s positions on Russia-related issues&quot;. Previously, after initially denying having met with Kisylak at all, Sessions had repeatedly asserted that in his meetings with the Russian ambassador he never discussed the campaign and only met with him in his capacity as a U.S. senator. The Department of Justice responded by saying that Sessions stood by his testimony that he &quot;never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election&quot;.

In March 2016, one of Trump&#x27;s foreign policy advisors named George Papadopoulos suggested that he could use personal connections to arrange a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and Sessions rejected the proposed meeting, according to information provided to CNN by a person in attendance. This raised questions on the truthfulness of Sessions&#x27;s testimony and whether Sessions committed perjury during his testimony. Furthermore, on the same day, testimony given by Carter Page to the House intelligence committee contradicted Sessions&#x27;s previous statements by stating that he had told Sessions about plans to visit Russia during the campaign.

Beginning in March 2017, senators asked the FBI to conduct a criminal perjury investigation into Sessions. Deputy Director Andrew McCabe then assigned FBI agents to investigate. According to Sessions&#x27;s personal lawyer, the investigation concluded without charges being brought.

On March 16, 2018, Sessions fired McCabe hours before the deputy director would have qualified for a government pension, citing McCabe&#x27;s lack of candor to the department&#x27;s inspector general.

==== Recusal from election investigation, and relationship with President Trump ====

The idea that Sessions might have to recuse himself from the Russia investigation was raised almost as soon as he took office. Trump was concerned about the implications of such a recusal, reportedly telling aides that he needed a loyalist overseeing the investigation. In early March he told White House counsel Don McGahn to urge Sessions to retain oversight of the investigation, but Sessions told McGahn he intended to follow the advice of Justice Department lawyers.

On March 2, 2017, Sessions announced that he would recuse himself from any investigations into Russia&#x27;s interference in the 2016 presidential election, or any other matters related to the 2016 presidential election. He had been advised to do so by career Justice Department personnel, citing concerns about impartiality given his prominent role in the Trump election campaign. When told that a special counsel had been appointed, the president slumped back in his chair and said, &quot;Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I&#x27;m fucked,&quot; then elaborating, “Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won’t be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.” That same day, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Sessions&#x27; contacts with Russians had been investigated, but it was not clear whether the investigation was ongoing. Sessions said during a televised interview that the recusal was not an admission of any wrongdoing. On June 8, 2017, James Comey, who had been dismissed as FBI director a month earlier, testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that he had expected Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation two weeks before he did so, for classified reasons that made Sessions&#x27;s continued engagement in the investigation &quot;problematic&quot;.

A few days after he announced his recusal, Sessions traveled to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump. Sessions wanted to talk about implementing Trump&#x27;s proposed travel ban, but instead Trump berated him for recusing himself and asked him to reverse his recusal. Sessions refused. In May 2017, Sessions offered to resign after receiving criticism from Trump, but Trump did not accept the resignation.

For the rest of Sessions&#x27;s tenure, Trump continued to be furious with him for his recusal, blaming it for the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Trump publicly attacked Sessions multiple times via Twitter and in public comments, saying he regretted choosing him as attorney general and that he never would have done so if he had known Sessions was going to recuse himself from the investigation. According to Bob Woodward&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, Trump called Sessions &quot;mentally retarded&quot; and described him as a &quot;dumb southerner&quot;. Trump denied ever using &quot;these terms on anyone&quot;, although he had been recorded using the word &quot;retarded&quot; as an insult on two episodes of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;.

In addition to criticizing him, Trump often used Twitter to suggest things he thought Sessions should do or to criticize Justice Department actions. According to Senator Jeff Flake, &quot;the president has been pushing [Sessions] very openly to go after the president&#x27;s enemies and lay off his friends,&quot; adding &quot;And so far, Jeff Sessions, bless his heart, has resisted and maintained that the judiciary needs to be independent.&quot; Trump demanded that Sessions investigate Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and various employees of the FBI and Justice Department. In August 2018 he said that Sessions should &quot;stop&quot; the Mueller investigation. He later tweeted that &quot;Our A.G. is scared stiff and Missing in Action.&quot; In an August interview Trump complained that Sessions &quot;never took control of the Justice Department&quot;, to which Sessions in a rare response said &quot;While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations... I took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in.&quot;

On September 3, 2018, Trump complained on Twitter that &quot;investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time.&quot; Many lawmakers, including Republican senators, said Trump&#x27;s remark was inappropriate, and a spokesperson for House speaker Paul Ryan said the Justice Department &quot;should always remain apolitical&quot;.

Trump often hinted he wanted to fire Sessions, perhaps after the November 2018 elections. Sessions told associates he did not intend to resign, but on November 7, 2018, he submitted a letter of resignation to Chief of Staff John Kelly at President Trump&#x27;s request.

==== Criminal justice ====
On April 3, 2017, Sessions announced that he intended to review consent decrees in which local law enforcement agencies had agreed to Department oversight. U.S. district judge James K. Bredar then denied Sessions&#x27;s request to delay a new consent decree with the Baltimore Police Department.

On May 12, 2017, Sessions ordered federal prosecutors to begin seeking the greatest criminal charges possible in drug cases. The new guidelines rescinded a memo by Attorney General Eric Holder that had sought to reduce mass incarceration by avoiding mandatory sentencing.

On July 19, 2017, Sessions signed an order reviving federally adopted civil asset forfeiture, which allows local law enforcement to bypass state limitations on seizing the property of those suspected but not charged of crimes.

In September 2017, the Justice Department under Sessions stated that it would no longer investigate police departments and publicize their shortcomings in reports, a policy previously enacted under the Obama administration. These reports were the basis of negotiating consent decrees.

On December 22, 2017, Sessions rescinded guidelines intended to warn local courts against imposing excessive fines and fees on poor defendants.

Sessions has brought prominence to prosecutions of the MS-13 gang.

In February 2018, Sessions sent a public letter to Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) opposing the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman&#x27;s bipartisan Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act bill. Sessions opposed White House senior advisor Jared Kushner&#x27;s support for the reforms until Kushner reportedly agreed to focus instead on improving prison conditions.

On March 20, 2018, Sessions signed a memo instructing federal prosecutors to seek capital punishment on major drug dealers.

In November 2018, just before Sessions was fired by Trump, Sessions ordered for consent decrees to be severely restricted.

In June 2020, Sessions asserted that former president Barack Obama had coddled criminals while disrespecting law enforcement. He characterized an episode in which &quot;there&#x27;s a riot, and he has a beer at the White House with some criminal, to listen to him. Wasn&#x27;t having a beer with the police officers.&quot; In July 2009, a brief uproar arose after a black Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates, was arrested by a white police officer as Gates attempted to enter his own home. Obama hosted both men at the White House to discuss the incident over beers.

==== Immigration ====

On March 27, 2017, Sessions told reporters that sanctuary cities failing to comply with policies of the Trump administration would lose federal funding, and cited the shooting of Kathryn Steinle as an example of an illegal immigrant committing a heinous crime.

On April 11, 2017, Sessions issued a memo for federal attorneys to consider prosecuting anyone harboring an illegal immigrant. On the same day, while at an entry border port in Nogales, Arizona, Sessions insisted the new administration would implement policies against those continuing &quot;to seek improper and illegal entry into this country&quot;. On April 21, nine sanctuary cities were sent letters by the Justice Department giving them a deadline of June 30 to provide an explanation of how their policies were not in violation of the law, and Sessions hours later warned &quot;enough is enough&quot; in San Diego amid his tour of the U.S.–Mexico border. Two days later, Sessions said that reducing false tax credits given to &quot;mostly Mexicans&quot; could pay for the U.S.–Mexico border and it would be paid for &quot;one way or the other&quot;.
Sessions attempted to block funding to sanctuary cities. Sessions also threatened to criminally prosecute uncooperative local officials. Federal judges in Chicago, San Francisco, and Philadelphia have rejected Sessions&#x27;s efforts.

On March 6, 2018, Sessions sued the state of California in federal district court, alleging that the state&#x27;s laws regarding prisoner release, workplace inspection, and detention site inspection are preempted by the federal government&#x27;s immigration policy.

Sessions played an important role in implementing the Trump administration family separation policy wherein illegal immigrants were separated from their children. In June 2018, Sessions gave a speech in which he cited the Bible to justify the family separation policy, declaring that people should &quot;obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order.&quot; Christian leaders strongly disagreed with the policy, with Cardinal Daniel DiNardo calling it &quot;immoral&quot;, Reverend Franklin Graham calling it &quot;disgraceful&quot;, and Bishop Kenneth Carter of Session&#x27;s own church (the United Methodist Church) calling it &quot;unnecessarily cruel&quot;. Bible scholar and professor Matthew Schlimm said that history was being repeated as Sessions had taken the quote &quot;completely out of context&quot; just as slave traders and Nazis had misused the Bible in the past. Sessions sought to distance himself from the family separation policy, letting others in the administration take the blame.

On June 11, 2018, Sessions reversed a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals granting a battered woman asylum and announced that victims of domestic abuse or gang violence will no longer qualify for asylum in the United States. He stated that &quot;[t]he mere fact that a country may have problems effectively policing certain crimessuch as domestic violence or gang violenceor that certain populations are more likely to be victims of crime, cannot itself establish an asylum claim.&quot; Domestic violence victims had been eligible for asylum since 2014. According to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, legal experts estimated that &quot;Sessions had single-handedly dismantled between sixty and seventy per cent of asylum jurisprudence from the previous three decades.&quot;

In April 2017, while on a radio talk show, Sessions said that he was &quot;amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power&quot;. This was in reference to Derrick Watson, a judge for the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, blocking an executive order by President Trump. After receiving criticism for the remark, Sessions said there is nothing he &quot;would want to phrase differently&quot; and that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t criticizing the judge or the island&quot;.

==== Marijuana ====

In a May 2017 letter, Sessions personally asked congressional leaders to repeal the Rohrabacher–Farr amendment so that the Justice Department could prosecute providers of medical marijuana. The Rohrabacher–Farr amendment is a 2014 measure that bars the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent states &quot;from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical marijuana&quot;. Sessions wrote in the letter that &quot;I believe it would be unwise for Congress to restrict the discretion of the Department to fund particular prosecutions, particularly in the midst of an historic drug epidemic and potentially long-term uptick in violent crime.&quot; John Hudak of the Brookings Institution criticized the letter, stating that it was a &quot;scare tactic&quot; that &quot;should make everyone openly question whether candidate Trump&#x27;s rhetoric and the White House&#x27;s words on his support for medical marijuana was actually a lie to the American public on an issue that garners broad, bipartisan support.&quot;

On January 4, 2018, Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum, which had prevented federal prosecutors from bringing charges against state legalized marijuana use.

==== Unite the Right rally violence and civil rights investigation ====

Sessions called the fatal vehicle-ramming attack at the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia an act of domestic terrorism, and began a civil rights investigation into the attack to determine if it will be tried in court as a hate crime. Sessions said &quot;You can be sure we will charge and advance the investigation toward the most serious charges that can be brought, because this is an unequivocally unacceptable and evil attack that cannot be accepted in America.&quot;

==== Gender identity ====

In a &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letter issued February 22, 2017, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Education withdrew and rescinded the 2016 &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letter issued jointly by the same organizations. The earlier &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letter, issued on May 13, 2016, had established that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 allows access to sex-segregated facilities (such as restrooms) corresponding to a student&#x27;s gender identity. The 2017 letter argued that the 2016 letter lacked &quot;extensive legal analysis&quot;, did not &quot;explain how the position is consistent with the express language of Title IX&quot;, and it had not undergone &quot;any formal public process&quot;. Sessions issued a statement which said &quot;Congress, state legislatures, and local governments are in a position to adopt appropriate policies or laws addressing this issue.&quot;

On October 4, 2017, Sessions released a Department of Justice (DoJ) memo interpreting Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, stating that Title VII &quot;is ordinarily defined to mean biologically male or female,&quot; but it &quot;does not prohibit discrimination based on gender identity &quot;per se&quot;.&quot; The memo was written to withdraw an earlier DoJ memorandum issued by Eric Holder on December 15, 2014, which aligned the DoJ with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on interpreting Title VII to include gender identity or transgender status as a protected class. At that time, DoJ had already stopped opposing claims of discrimination brought by transgender federal employees. Devin O&#x27;Malley, representing the DoJ, stated &quot;the last administration abandoned that fundamental principle [that the Department of Justice cannot expand the law beyond what Congress has provided], which necessitated today&#x27;s action.&quot; Sharon McGowan, a lawyer with Lambda Legal who previously served in the Civil Rights division of DoJ, rejected that argument, saying &quot;this memo [issued by Sessions] is not actually a reflection of the law as it isit&#x27;s a reflection of what the DOJ wishes the law were&quot; and &quot;[t]he Justice Department is actually getting back in the business of making anti-transgender law in court.&quot;

==== Turkey&#x27;s sanctions against Sessions ====

On August 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on top Turkish government officials who were involved in the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson, who was arrested in October 2016, several months after a failed coup attempt in Turkey. Turkey&#x27;s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ordered Sessions&#x27;s assets in Turkey frozen in retaliation for U.S. sanctions.

=== Resignation ===
On November 7, 2018 (the day after the 2018 midterm elections), Sessions resigned as attorney general at the president&#x27;s request.

== U.S. Senate campaign (2020) ==
In October 2019, Sessions began exploring a potential candidacy for his old Senate seat in the 2020 election. On November 7, 2019, Sessions, the night before the deadline to file in the hyper-competitive Republican race, announced his candidacy. The winner of the Republican primary would challenge incumbent Democrat Doug Jones.

With no candidate acquiring more than 50% of the vote in the Republican primary, Sessions advanced to the run-off originally to be held on March 31, but delayed until July 14 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sessions faced the former head football coach at Auburn University, Tommy Tuberville. During the primary, Alabama&#x27;s senior senator Richard Shelby asked Trump to stay out of the race. However, after the first-round primary Trump endorsed Tuberville. Throughout the campaign, Sessions had called himself an ally and supporter of Trump. However, on April3 the Trump campaign sent a letter to Sessions, objecting and condemning the connections that Sessions has made between him and Trump during the Senate race.

Throughout the campaign Sessions repeatedly defended attacks from the President on Twitter. On May 22, 2020, President Trump tweeted &quot;3 years ago, after Jeff Sessions recused himself, the Fraudulent Mueller Scam began. Alabama, do not trust Jeff Sessions. He let our Country down...&quot; Sessions responded the next day by tweeting: &quot;Mr. President, Alabama can and does trust me, as do conservatives across the country. Perhaps you&#x27;ve forgotten. They trusted me when I stepped out and put that trust on the line for you.&quot; The President responded directly by continuing to deride Sessions, while further encouraging him to drop out of the race entirely.

Sessions lost the Alabama Senate primary to Tommy Tuberville on July 14, 2020. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; headline read, &quot;Sessions loses runoff in Alabama as Trump helps end career of key supporter he came to despise&quot;.

== Political positions ==

During his tenure, Sessions was considered one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate.

=== Immigration ===

Sessions was an opponent of legal and illegal immigration during his time in Congress. He opposed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 and the bi-partisan Gang of Eight&#x27;s Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013. He said that a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants undermines the rule of law, that the inflow of guest workers and immigrants depresses wages and raises unemployment for United States citizens, and that current immigration policy expands an underclass dependent on the welfare state. In a May 2006 floor speech, he said, &quot;Fundamentally, almost no one coming from the Dominican Republic to the United States is coming because they have a skill that would benefit us and that would indicate their likely success in our society.&quot; He is a supporter of E-Verify, the federal database that allows businesses to electronically verify the immigration status of potential new hires, and has advocated for expanded construction of a Southern border fence. In 2013, Sessions said an opt-out provision in immigration legislation before Congress would allow Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to avoid building a border fence. PolitiFact called Session&#x27;s statement false, stating that the provision would allow Napolitano to determine where the fence was built, not to opt out of building it entirely.

Sessions&#x27;s Senate website expressed his view that there is a &quot;clear nexus between immigration and terrorism&quot; and that &quot;Plainly, there is no way to vet these refugees&quot; who would immigrate to the U.S. from Syria in 2016 or who came to the U.S. after September 11, 2001, and were alleged to be involved in terrorism. The news release said that &quot;the absence of derogatory information in our systems about an individual does not mean that admitting that individual carries no risk.&quot; Sessions has expressed the view that the children of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries are &quot;susceptible to the toxic radicalization of terrorist organizations&quot; on the basis of the Orlando and San Bernardino attacks. Sessions supported establishing safe zones as an alternative to immigration from war-torn countries.

Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon talked about Sessions as the leader of the movement for slowing down both legal and illegal immigration before Donald Trump came to the scene, considering his work to kill immigration reform as akin &quot;to the civil rights movement of 1960&quot;. Sessions and his communications director Stephen Miller developed what Miller describes as &quot;nation-state populism&quot; as a response to globalization and immigration.

Immigration is the issue that brought Sessions and Trump together. Trump has credited Sessions as an influential advisor on immigration. After Trump was elected and announced Sessions as his attorney general nominee, Cato Institute immigration analyst Alex Nowrasteh observed &quot;It&#x27;s almost as if Sessions wrote Trump&#x27;s immigration platform.&quot;

On June 18, 2018, a group of more than 600 United Methodist Church clergy and laity announced that they were bringing church law charges against Sessions. The members of the group accused him of &quot;child abuse, immorality, racial discrimination and dissemination of doctrines contrary to the standards of the doctrine of the United Methodist Church&quot;.

According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a woman and her child fled domestic abuse in El Salvador to seek asylum in the U.S. However the mother was removed from her detention facility and likely put on a plane on August 9, 2018, despite Justice Department promises that she and others would not be deported before the judge could rule on their cases. Judge Emmet G. Sullivan demanded, &quot;Turn that plane around.&quot; He threatened to hold those responsible for the removal in contempt of court, starting with Sessions, if the situation was not rectified. A Department of Homeland Security official stated, &quot;We are complying with the court&#x27;s requests... the plaintiffs will not disembark and will be promptly returned to the United States.&quot; An ACLU suit challenged a decision by Sessions to make it nearly impossible for victims of domestic violence and gangs to qualify for asylum in the U.S.

=== Foreign and military policy ===

In 2005, Sessions spoke at a rally in Washington, D.C. in favor of the War in Iraq organized in opposition to an anti-war protest held the day before. Sessions said of the anti-war protesters: &quot;The group who spoke here the other day did not represent the American ideals of freedom, liberty and spreading that around the world. I frankly don&#x27;t know what they represent, other than to blame America first.&quot; The same year, he opposed legislation by Senator John McCain prohibiting the U.S. military from engaging in torture; the amendment passed 90–9.

Sessions opposed the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the 2011 military intervention in Libya, and arming the Syrian rebels. As Attorney General, he reportedly advised President Trump against increasing the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan.

In the 109th Congress, Sessions introduced legislation to increase the death gratuity benefit for families of service members from $12,420 to $100,000. The bill also increased the level of coverage under the Servicemen&#x27;s Group Life Insurance from $250,000 to $400,000. Sessions&#x27;s legislation was accepted in the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2005.

In June 2014, Sessions was one of three senators to vote against additional funding for the VA medical system. He opposed the bill due to cost concerns and indicated that Congress should instead focus on &quot;reforms and solutions that improve the quality of service and the effectiveness that is delivered&quot;.

In September 2016, in advance of a UN Security Council resolution 2334 condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, Sessions signed an AIPAC-sponsored letter urging President Barack Obama to veto &quot;one-sided&quot; resolutions against Israel.

=== Crime and security ===
In 1996, Sessions promoted state legislation in Alabama that sought to punish a second drug trafficking conviction, including for dealing marijuana, with a mandatory minimum death sentence. Sessions&#x27;s views on drugs and crime have since softened.

Sessions supported the reduction (but not the elimination) of the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powdered cocaine, ultimately passed into law with the Fair Sentencing Act 2010.

On October 5, 2005, Sessions was one of nine senators who voted against a Senate amendment to a House bill that prohibited cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment of individuals in the custody or under the physical control of the United States Government.

In November 2010, Sessions was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee when the committee voted unanimously in favor of the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA), and sent the bill to the full Senate for consideration. The proposed law would allow the attorney general to ask a court to issue a restraining order on Internet domain names that host copyright-infringing material.

In October 2015, Sessions opposed Chairman Chuck Grassley&#x27;s (R-IA) Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, a bipartisan bill which sought to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for some nonviolent crimes. The United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary approved the bill by a vote of 15–5. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Sessions, Tom Cotton, and David Perdue &quot;stalled the bill in the Senate and sapped momentum from a simultaneous House effort&quot;. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL), a co-sponsor of the bill, has said Sessions was its top opponent.

Sessions has been a strong supporter of civil forfeiture, the government practice of seizing property when it has allegedly been involved in a crime. Sessions opposes &quot;any reform&quot; of civil forfeiture legislation.

From March 2018 until the end of his service as attorney general, Sessions sat on the Federal Commission on School Safety.

=== Economic issues ===

Sessions voted for the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts, and said he would vote to make them permanent if given the chance. He is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

Sessions was one of 25 senators to vote against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the bank bailout), arguing that it &quot;undermines our heritage of law and order, and is an affront to the principle of separation of powers&quot;.

Sessions opposed the $837billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, calling it &quot;the largest spending bill in the history of the republic&quot;. In late 2011 he also expressed skepticism about the $447billion jobs bill proposed by President Obama, and disputed the notion that the bill would be paid for without adding to the national debt.

=== Higher education and research ===

In 2013, Sessions sent a letter to National Endowment for the Humanities enquiring why the foundation funded projects that he deemed frivolous. He also criticized the foundation for distributing books related to Islam to hundreds of U.S. libraries, saying &quot;Using taxpayer dollars to fund education program grant questions that are very indefinite or in an effort to seemingly use Federal funds on behalf of just one religion, does not on its face appear to be the appropriate means to establish confidence in the American people that NEH expenditures are wise.&quot;

=== Social issues ===

Sessions voted against the Matthew Shepard Act, which added acts of bias-motivated violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity to federal hate-crimes law, commenting that it &quot;has been said to cheapen the civil rights movement&quot;. Sessions &quot;believes that a marriage is union between a man and a woman, and has routinely criticized the U.S. Supreme Court and activist lower courts when they try to judicially redefine marriage&quot;. Sessions voted in favor of advancing the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004 and 2006, a U.S. constitutional amendment which would have permanently restricted federal recognition of marriages to those between a man and a woman. Sessions voted against the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.

Sessions has also said regarding the appointment of a gay Supreme Court justice, &quot;I do not think that a person who acknowledges that they have gay tendencies is disqualified, per se, for the job&quot; but &quot;that would be a big concern that the American people might feelmight feel uneasy about that.&quot;

Sessions is against legalizing marijuana for either recreational or medicinal use. &quot;I&#x27;m a big fan of the DEA,&quot; he said during a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sessions was &quot;heartbroken&quot; and found &quot;it beyond comprehension&quot; when President Obama said that cannabis is not as dangerous as alcohol. In April 2016, he said that it was important to foster &quot;knowledge that this drug is dangerous, you cannot play with it, it is not funny, it&#x27;s not something to laugh about... and to send that message with clarity that good people don&#x27;t smoke marijuana.&quot; In March 2017, prepared remarks for a speech of his called cannabis &quot;only slightly less awful&quot; than heroin, and he argued that &quot;lives [were] at stake&quot; in legalizing the drug.
Sessions believes &quot;that sanctity of life begins at conception&quot;.

Sessions was one of 34 senators to vote against the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007, which was vetoed by President Bush and would have provided funding for human embryonic stem cell research.

=== Health care reform ===

In 2006, Sessions coauthored legislation amending the Ryan White CARE Act to increase the share of HIV/AIDS funding going to rural states, including Alabama.

Sessions opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

Following Senator Ted Cruz&#x27;s 21-hour speech opposing the Affordable Care Act in 2013, Sessions joined Cruz and 17 other senators in a failed vote against cloture on a comprehensive government funding bill that would have continued funding healthcare reform.

=== Energy and environment ===

Sessions rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. He has voted in favor of legislation that would bar the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gases. He has voted to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. Sessions is a proponent of nuclear power.

=== Judicial nominations ===

As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions defended unsuccessful circuit court nominee Charles W. Pickering against allegations of racism, saying he was &quot;a leader for racial harmony&quot;. Sessions rejected criticisms of successful circuit court nominee Dennis Shedd&#x27;s record, saying he &quot;should have been commended for the rulings he has made&quot;. In 2003, Sessions viewed criticisms of Alabama Attorney General William H. Pryor Jr.&#x27;s ultimately successful circuit court appointment as being due to his faith, stating that &quot;Are we not saying that good Catholics need not apply?&quot;

Sessions was a supporter of the &quot;nuclear option&quot;, a tactic considered by then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist in the spring of 2005 to change longstanding Senate rules to stop Democratic filibusters (or, &quot;talking a bill to death&quot;) of some of George W. Bush&#x27;s nominees to the federal courts. When the &quot;Gang of 14&quot; group of moderate senators reached an agreement to allow filibusters under &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;, Sessions accepted the agreement but argued that &quot;a return to the tradition of up-or-down votes on all judicial nominees would... strengthen the Senate.&quot;

While serving as the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee in the 110th Congress, Sessions was the senior Republican who questioned Judge Sonia Sotomayor, President Barack Obama&#x27;s nominee to succeed retiring Justice David Souter. Sessions focused on Sotomayor&#x27;s views on empathy as a quality for a judge, arguing that &quot;empathy for one party is always prejudice against another.&quot; Sessions also questioned the nominee about her views on the use of foreign law in deciding cases, as well as her role in the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund (PRLDEF). On July 28, 2009, Sessions joined five Republican colleagues in voting against Sotomayor&#x27;s nomination in the Judiciary Committee. The committee approved Sotomayor by a vote of 13–6. Sessions also voted against Sotomayor when her nomination came before the full Senate. He was one of 31 senators (all Republicans) to do so, while 68 voted to confirm the nominee.

Sessions also served as the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee during the nomination process for Elena Kagan, President Obama&#x27;s nominee to succeed retired Justice John Paul Stevens. Sessions based his opposition on the nominee&#x27;s lack of experience, her background as a political operative (Kagan had said that she worked in the Clinton White House not as a lawyer but as a policy adviser), and her record on guns, abortion, and gay rights. Sessions pointed out that Kagan &quot;has a very thin record legally, never tried a case, never argued before a jury, only had her first appearance in the appellate courts a year ago&quot;.

Sessions focused the majority of his criticism on Kagan&#x27;s treatment of the military while she was dean of Harvard Law School. During her tenure, Kagan reinstated the practice of requiring military recruiters to coordinate their activities through a campus veterans organization, rather than the school&#x27;s Office of Career Services. Kagan argued that she was trying to comply with a law known as the Solomon Amendment, which barred federal funds from any college or university that did not grant military recruiters equal access to campus facilities. Sessions asserted that Kagan&#x27;s action was a violation of the Solomon Amendment and that it amounted to &quot;demeaning and punishing the military&quot;. He also argued that her action showed a willingness to place her politics above the law, and questioned &quot;whether she had the intellectual honesty, the clarity of mind, that you would expect on the Supreme Court&quot;.

On July 20, 2010, Sessions and five Republican colleagues voted against Kagan&#x27;s nomination. Despite this, the Judiciary Committee approved the nomination by a 13–6 vote. Sessions also voted against Kagan in the full Senate vote, joining 36 other senators (including one Democrat) in opposition. 63 senators voted to confirm Kagan. Following the vote, Sessions remarked on future nominations and elections, saying that Americans would &quot;not forgive the Senate if we further expose our Constitution to revision and rewrite by judicial fiat to advance what President Obama says is a broader vision of what America should be&quot;.

In March 2016, following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and President Obama&#x27;s nomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, Sessions said the Senate &quot;should not confirm a new Supreme Court justice until a new president is elected&quot;.

=== Legislation ===

In 1999, Sessions cosponsored the bill to award Rosa Parks the Congressional Gold Medal.

On December 11, 2013, Sessions cosponsored the Victims of Child Abuse Act Reauthorization Act of 2013, a bill that would reauthorize the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 and would authorize funding through 2018 to help child abuse victims. Sessions argued that &quot;there is no higher duty than protecting our nation&#x27;s children, and this bill is an important step to ensure the most vulnerable children receive the care and support they deserve.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Sessions and his wife Mary have three children and as of March 30, 2020, ten grandchildren. The family attends a United Methodist church. Specifically, Jeff and Mary Sessions are members of the Ashland Place United Methodist Church in Mobile; Jeff Sessions has taught Sunday school there.

<doc id="375238" wikidata="Q236118" url="?curid=375238" title="Southern Cone">
<text>The Southern Cone (, ) is a geographical and cultural subregion composed of the southernmost areas of South America, mostly south of the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the east by the Atlantic Ocean. In terms of geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay, and sometimes includes Brazil&#x27;s four southernmost states (Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and São Paulo). 

The Southern Cone is the subregion in Latin America with the highest Human Development Index, and it has historically had a high standard of living; it is located at latitudes in the southern hemisphere that would correspond in the northern hemisphere to the United States, Canadian provinces, European countries (except the Nordic countries), northern China, the Korean Peninsula and Japan.

==Geography and extent==
=== Countries ===
In most cases, the term &quot;Southern Cone&quot; refers specifically to Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay, due to their geographical, cultural, ethnic, and economic similarities.
=== Other regions ===

==== Brazil ====
Brazil&#x27;s four southernmost states (Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and São Paulo) share characteristics with Argentina, and Uruguay (high standard of living, subtropical and temperate climate, high levels of industrialization and strong European ethnic component due to immigration), the other states are more similar to the other South American countries in these issues.

When the definition is not limited to entire countries, the states of the South Region and the state of São Paulo are generally included.

==== Paraguay ====
Due to the geographical proximity, common history, geography and political cycles, Paraguay is sometimes included in what is meant by Southern Cone, geographically speaking, but excluded due to differences in climate, economy and development, and cultural identity. 
While Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay are located in the southernmost part of South America, with temperate climates and a dominant European ancestry shaping their demographics and culture, Paraguay is a landlocked country further north, with a subtropical climate and a unique cultural identity rooted in its Guaraní heritage.
Economically, Paraguay has a lower Human Development Index (HDI) compared to the Southern Cone countries, which rank among the highest in Latin America. Paraguay’s economy, focused on agriculture and hydroelectric power, is also less diversified and globally integrated.

=== Climate ===
The climates are mostly Mediterranean temperate, but include humid subtropical, highland tropical, maritime temperate, sub-Antarctic temperate, highland cold, desert and semi-arid temperate regions. (Except for the northern regions of Argentina (thermal equator in January), the whole country of Paraguay, the Argentina-Brazil border and the interior of the Atacama Desert). The region rarely suffers from heat. In addition to that, the winter presents mostly cold temperatures. Strong and constant wind and high humidity are what brings low temperatures in the winter. 

One of the most peculiar plants of the region is the &quot;Araucaria&quot; tree, which can be found in Chile, Argentina and parts of Brazil. The only native group of conifers found in the southern hemisphere had its origin in the Southern Cone. &quot;Araucaria angustifolia&quot;, once widespread in Southern Brazil, is now a critically endangered species, protected by law. The prairies region of central Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil is known as the Pampas.

Central Chile has Mediterranean vegetation and a Mediterranean climate, grading southward into an oceanic climate. The Atacama, Patagonian and Monte deserts form a diagonal of arid lands separating the woodlands, croplands and pastures of La Plata basin from Central and Southern Chile. Apart from the desert diagonal, the north–south running Andes form a major divide in the Southern Cone and constitute, for most of its part in the southern cone, the Argentina–Chile border. In the east the river systems of the La Plata basin form natural barriers and sea lanes between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

The Atacama Desert is the driest place on Earth, with some regions having no recorded rainfall in history.

== Culture ==
Besides sharing languages and colonial heritage, in this area, there was extensive European immigration during the 19th- and 20th-centuries, who, with their descendants, have strongly influenced the culture, social life and politics of these countries. Immigration reshaped the modern-day societies of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, countries where the influx of newcomers was massive.

The residents of the states of the Southern Cone are avid players and fans of football, with top-notch teams competing in the sport. Argentina has won the FIFA World Cup three times, while Uruguay has won the cup twice; they are the only national teams along with Brazil outside Europe to have won the cup. Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil have all hosted the World Cup. Additionally, national teams from the region have won several Olympic medals in football. Also, football clubs from the Southern Cone countries have won large numbers of club competitions in South-American competitions, Pan-American competitions, and world-FIFA Club World Cup-level competitions.

&quot;Gauchos&quot; (Argentina and Uruguay) and &quot;Huasos&quot; (Chile) are horsemen that are considered icons of national identity (like cowboys); they are featured in the epic poem &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;.

=== Gastronomy ===
The &quot;Asado&quot; (barbecue) is a culinary tradition typical of the Southern Cone main countries and was developed by &quot;gauchos&quot; and &quot;huasos&quot;. 

Mate is a popular infusion throughout the Southern Cone.

=== Religion ===

Like the rest of Latin America, most residents of the Southern Cone are members of the Catholic Church, with a minority of Protestants, including a significant Lutheran population in South Brazil and South Chile. Other religions also present in the southern cone include Islam, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Buddhism, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Daoism. Jewish communities have thrived in cities of Argentina and Uruguay.

While the Southern Cone has been conservative in some aspects of religion, it has had a tradition of social reform and liberation theology has been followed by many in the Catholic Church. Uruguay, where agnosticism and atheism is common, has a policy of strong separation of church and state; it is one of the most secular countries in the Americas. Uruguay, Chile and Argentina, in that order, have the least religious residents in South America, according to their responses about the significance of religion in their lives. According to the Pew Research Center, 28% of Uruguayans, 43% of Argentines, and 41% of Chileans think of religion &#x27;very important in their lives,&#x27; contrasting with the higher values given by the residents of countries such as Peru (72%), Colombia (77%) and Ecuador (76%).

The Southern Cone produced the first pope from the Western Hemisphere, Pope Francis, elected in 2013, born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
=== Other Cultural ===
In a 2014 social survey, residents rated their countries as &#x27;good places for gay or lesbian people to live;&#x27; the following percentages said &#x27;yes&#x27; in Uruguay (71%), Argentina (68%), and Chile (52%).

==Language==
The overwhelming majority, including those of recent immigrant background, speak Spanish (in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay) or Portuguese in the case of Southern Brazil. The Spanish-speaking countries of the Southern Cone are divided into two main dialects:

*Castellano Rioplatense (River Plate Spanish), spoken in Argentina and Uruguay, where the accent and daily language is heavily influenced by 19th-20th century Italian immigrants, has a particular intonation famously recognized by Spanish speakers from around the world. It is sometimes unofficially referred to as &quot;Castellano Argentino/Argentine Spanish&quot; due to the majority of the speakers (by population) being Argentines. Preliminary research has shown that Rioplatense Spanish has intonation patterns that resemble those of Italian dialects in the Naples region, differing markedly from those of other forms of Spanish. Buenos Aires, Rosario, and Montevideo had a massive influx of Italian immigrant settlers from the mid-19th until mid-20th centuries. Researchers note that the development of this dialect is a relatively recent phenomenon, developing at the beginning of the 20th century with the main wave of Italian immigration.
*Castellano Chileno (Chilean Spanish), spoken in Chile, features multiple accents, but one of its most common characteristics is the omission of the letter &quot;s&quot; when pronouncing words. For example, &quot;Los chilenos&quot; is pronounced as &quot;Lo&#x27; chileno&#x27;.&quot; Additionally, in informal and colloquial speech (especially among close friends), the use of reverential voseo is common. This phenomenon changes phrases like &quot;¿Dónde estás?&quot; (&quot;Where are you?&quot;) into &quot;¿Dónde estáis?&quot;. However, since Chileans often omit the final &quot;s,&quot; the resulting pronunciation is &quot;¿Dónde estai?&quot;

These dialects share common traits, such as a number of Lunfardo and Quechua words.

Minor languages and dialects include Cordobés, Cuyo, and Portuñol, a hybrid between Rioplatense and Brazilian Portuguese that is spoken in Uruguay on the border with Brazil.

===Native American languages===
Some Native American groups, especially in rural areas, continue to speak autochthonous languages, including Mapudungun (also known as Mapuche), Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani. The first is primarily spoken in Araucanía and adjacent areas of Patagonia, in southern Argentina and Chile. Guarani is the official language of Paraguay, the most widely spoken language in that country, and in 2010, the city of Tacuru, in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, adopted Guarani as the official language, besides Portuguese. It is also a co-official language in the northeastern Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Misiones.

===Non-Iberian languages===
Italian (mostly its Northern dialects, such as Venetian), is spoken in rural communities across Argentina, Southern Brazil, and São Paulo where immigrants had settled.

German, in various dialects, is mostly spoken in Southern Chile and Southern Brazil. As well as in the Chaco (Paraguay) by Mennonites. It is the second most spoken mother tongue in Brazil.

The Southern Cone is also known to have high English proficiency compared to other South American countries. This language is spoken in the Falkland Islands, a British Overseas Territory (disputed by Argentina).

Polish, Dutch and Ukrainian are also spoken in Southern Brazil. Dutch is spoken in Chile as well, and Ukrainian is used in Argentina as well. Croatian and other Slavic languages are also spoken in the southernmost areas of Chilean Patagonia, reflecting patterns of immigration and settlement. Yiddish can be heard mainly in Buenos Aires, Argentina and São Paulo, Brazil. In Brazil, Japanese is spoken by immigrant communities in the states of São Paulo and Paraná. By descendants in Argentina and Chile, Welsh is spoken by descendants of immigrants in the Patagonia region.

Comparison of selected words

Below there are selected words to show vocabulary in the dialects of the countries of the Southern Cone and other Spanish-speaking countries in South America and the dialect of Portuguese spoken in Brazil.
==Demography==

The population of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay is 40, 16.8 and 3.6 million respectively. Buenos Aires is the largest metropolitan area at 13.1 million and Santiago, Chile has 6.4 million. Uruguay&#x27;s capital and largest city, Montevideo, has 1.8 million, and it receives many visitors on ferry boats across the Río de la Plata from Buenos Aires, away.

By contrast, the Patagonia region of southern Chile and Argentina is very sparsely populated, with a population density of less than two people per square kilometer.

===Ethnicity===

The population of the Southern Cone has been strongly influenced by waves of immigration from Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. People of direct European descent, make up 88% of total population of Uruguay, 85% of the total population of Argentina and 65% of the total population of Chile. The remainder of the population in these countries consists predominantly of mestizos with a significant proportion of European ancestry. In São Paulo, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina self-identified white people are 61.3%; 70.0%; 82.3%; and 86.8% of the population respectively, with people of Italian, Polish and German ancestry predominating.

Italians started to emigrate to the Southern Cone as early as the second half of the 17th century, and it became a mass phenomenon between 1880 and 1920 when Italy was facing social and economic disturbances. As a consequence of mass Italian immigration, the Southern Cone has the largest Italian diaspora in the world, with people of Italian descent being the majority in many places, with the highest percentage being in Argentina (62.5% Italian), and in the southern Brazilian state of Santa Catarina (60% Italian). Among all Italians who immigrated to Brazil, 70% went to the State of São Paulo. In consequence, the State of São Paulo has more people with Italian ancestry than any region of Italy itself, with São Paulo city being the most populous city with Italian ancestry in the world, of the 10 million inhabitants of São Paulo city, 60% (6 million people) have full or partial Italian ancestry (the largest city of Italy is Rome, with 2.5 million inhabitants). Small towns, such as Nova Veneza, have as much as 95% of their population of Italian descent.

The region also has a large German diaspora (second largest after the United States), with People of German descent being 25% of the population of Rio Grande do Sul and 35% of the population of Santa Catarina. Residents of German descent even predominate in South Chile due to German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue. 

Mestizos make up 15.8% of the population and are a majority in Paraguay. Native Americans make up 3% of the population, living in communities in Araucanía region in Chile. Mulattoes (people of European and African ancestry) mostly in Uruguay (0.2%), and Asians (1.0%), mostly in Argentina, the remaining 1.2%.

There is also a strong Arab presence in the Southern Cone, with people of full or at least partial Arab ancestry being 5% of the population of Uruguay and Chile, 9.8% of the population of Brazil, and 11% of the population of Argentina. Brazil has the largest number of Arabs outside the Middle East, with 20 million Brazilians being descendants of Arabs, while the Palestinian community in Chile is considered the largest outside the Arab world.

===Genetic and historical roots===
Since interethnic marriages are widespread in Latin America, complex ethnic classifications emerged, including more than a dozen of &quot;racial&quot; categories created in 18th century Hispanic America, with notorious examples being &quot;castizo&quot;, &quot;morisco&quot; and . In Brazil, about 190 &quot;racial&quot; categories were detected by the Census of 1976.

A study conducted on 218 individuals in 2010 by the Argentine geneticist Daniel Corach, has established that the genetic map of Argentina is composed of 79% different European ethnicities (mainly Spanish and Italian ethnicities), 18% of different indigenous ethnicities, and 4.3% of African ethnic groups, in which 63.6% of the tested group had at least one ancestor who was Indigenous.
An autosomal DNA study from 2009 found the composition of the Argentine population to be 78.5% European, 17.3% Amerindian, and 4.2% Sub-Saharan African (SSA). Blacks made up 25% of the population of Buenos Aires in 1810, 1822 and 1838. In 1887, the government decided to cease asking Argentine citizens about their race. According to Laura López, it was a way to &quot;hide&quot; the Black population, not only from the Census, but also from public opinion. 

Multiple studies concluded that Whites make 50-65% of the Chilean population and the CIA concluded that 89% are Whites, Castizos and Mestizos. The use of mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome test results show the following: The European component is predominant (91.0%, versus 9.0% of the aboriginal one) in the Chilean upper class, the middle classes, 66.8%-62.3% European component and 37.7%-33.2 of mixed aboriginal and lower classes at 55–52.9% European component and 47.1%-45% mix of Aboriginal.

A DNA study from 2009, published in the American Journal of Human Biology, showed the genetical composition of Uruguay to be mainly European, but with Native American (which varies from 1% to 20% in different parts of the country) and also SSA (7% to 15% in different parts of the country).

Similar to the rest of Latin America, the genetic ancestry of the population of the Southern Cone reflects the history of the continent: the Iberian colonizers were mostly men who arrived without women. European immigration to this part of the world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought more European and Middle Eastern components to the local population.

==Education and standards of living==

The Southern Cone is the most prosperous region in Latin America. The region has relatively high standard of living and quality of life. Chile&#x27;s, Argentina&#x27;s, and Uruguay&#x27;s HDIs — (0.860), (0.849) and (0.830) — are the highest in Latin America, similar to European countries like Croatia, Portugal, Slovakia, Hungary or Romania. 

The region has a high life expectancy, and access to health care and education. In Uruguay, illiteracy technically does not exist. 

From an economic point of view, the Southern Cone countries has been praised for being the most Libertarian and pro Free market in Latin America that gave them the profile of &quot;emerging economies&quot;.

Crime rate is significantly lower in this region compared other countries in Latin America.

Since the return to democracy, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay have experienced significant democratic stability. After enduring military dictatorships during the 1970s and 1980s, each country transitioned to democratic governance, leading to a more open and participatory political environment.
==Politics==
During the second half of 20th century, these countries were in some periods ruled by right-wing juntas, military nationalistic dictatorships.
Around the 1970s, these regimes collaborated in Plan Cóndor against leftist opposition, including urban guerrillas.
However, by the early 1980s Argentina and Uruguay restored their democracies; Chile followed suit in 1990.

<text>Puuc is the name of a region in the Mexican state of Yucatán and a Maya architectural style prevalent in that region. The word &quot;puuc&quot; is derived from the Maya term for &quot;hill&quot;. Since the Yucatán is relatively flat, this term was extended to encompass the large karstic range of hills in the southern portion of the state, hence the terms Puuc region or Puuc hills. The Puuc hills extend into northern Campeche and western Quintana Roo.

The term Puuc is also used to designate the architectural style of ancient Maya sites located within the Puuc hills, hence the term Puuc architecture. This architectural style began at the end of the Late Classic period but experienced its greatest extent during the Terminal Classic period.

==Puuc architecture==
In the florescence of Puuc architecture (such as at the ancient Maya site of Uxmal) buildings were decorated with carefully cut veneer stones set into a concrete core. The lower portion of the façades are blank with a flat surface of rectangular blocks punctuated by doorways, while the upper façade is richly decorated with intricate stone mosaics, often alternating repeated geometric elements with more elaborate figurative sculpture. Long-nosed masks (commonly believed to be of the Maya rain god Chaac) are found on many Puuc buildings.

Beyond the impressive decorative elements of Puuc architecture, the use of a concrete core is also considered an architectural advance beyond the earlier Maya technique of using larger stones (set on top of one another in lime and mud mortar) for structural support. The concrete core-veneer masonry allowed for slightly larger and more stable interior rooms. Many corbelled vaults in the Puuc style remain standing, even when most of the veneer stones have fallen away.

The most famous of the Maya sites exhibiting the Puuc architectural style is Uxmal; other major Puuc-style sites in the region include Labna, Kabah, Sayil and Xlapak. The architectural style is also seen at Kiuic, Bolonchen, Chunhuhub, Xculoc, and many smaller ruins. The transition from earlier Classic Period architecture to Puuc style core-veneer masonry is well documented at the site of Oxkintok. To the south, the style can be found in Edzná; and to the east at Chichen Itza (outside of the Puuc Hills region).

As stated by the Maya explorer Teobert Maler, who explored this zone intensively, the area around the site of Dolores is full of ruins. The recently completed Chunhuaymil project compiled data of the remaining Puuc architecture of 19 archaeological sites located in a 100 square kilometers area.

==Puuc Biocultural State Reserve==
Puuc Biocultural State Reserve, also known as Kaxil Kiuic reserve (Spanish &quot;Reserva Estatal Biocultural del Puuc&quot;) was designated in 2011. It covers an area of 1358.93 km2. The reserve was created to protect the region&#x27;s archeological sites as well as its biodiverse flora and fauna. The reserve is home to 247 bird, 63 mammal, 52 reptile, and 14 amphibian species. Five species of large felines, including jaguars, live in the reserve.

<text>Serpentine subgroup (part of the kaolinite-serpentine group in the category of phyllosilicates) are greenish, brownish, or spotted minerals commonly found in serpentinite. They are used as a source of magnesium and asbestos, and as decorative stone. The name comes from the greenish color and smooth or scaly appearance from the Latin , meaning &quot;snake-like&quot;.

Serpentine subgroup is a set of common rock-forming hydrous magnesium iron phyllosilicate () minerals, resulting from the metamorphism of the minerals that are contained in mafic to ultramafic rocks. They may contain minor amounts of other elements including chromium, manganese, cobalt or nickel. In mineralogy and gemology, serpentine may refer to any of the 20 varieties belonging to the serpentine subgroup. Owing to admixture, these varieties are not always easy to individualize, and distinctions are not usually made. There are three important mineral polymorphs of serpentine: antigorite, lizardite and chrysotile.

Serpentine minerals are polymorphous, meaning that they have the same chemical formulae, but the atoms are arranged into different structures, or crystal lattices. Chrysotile, which has a fibrous habit, is one polymorph of serpentine and is one of the more important asbestos minerals. Other polymorphs in the serpentine subgroup may have a platy habit. Antigorite and lizardite are the polymorphs with platy habit.

Many types of serpentine have been used for jewelry and hardstone carving, sometimes under the name &quot;false jade&quot; or &quot;Teton jade&quot;.

==Properties and structure==

Most serpentines are opaque to translucent, light (specific gravity between 2.2 and 2.9), soft (hardness 2.5–4), infusible and susceptible to acids. All are microcrystalline and massive in habit, never being found as single crystals. Lustre may be vitreous, silky or greasy. Colors range from white to grey, yellow to green, and brown to black, and are often splotchy or veined. Many are intergrown with other minerals, such as calcite and dolomite.

The basic structural unit of serpentine is a polar layer 0.72 nm thick. A Mg-rich trioctahedral sheet is tightly linked on one side to a single tetrahedral silicate sheet, regardless of the 3–5% larger lateral lattice dimensions of the octahedral sheet. The second level of the structure organized into different serpentine species originates partly to compensate the intra-layer stress due to this dimensional misfit. Good compensation results in a nearly constant layer curvature, with the larger octahedral sheet on the convex side. However, such curvature weakens the H-bonding between the layers. H-bonding tries to maintain flat layers, but this competes with the requirements of misfit compensation. As a result, the layers are locally either curved or flat. Antigorite, lizardite and chrysotile have the same chemical composition, but their different layer of curvatures result in lamellar agglomerated antigorite and lizardite and fibrous chrysotile elongated mineral particles.

==Occurrence==
Serpentine minerals are ubiquitous in many geological systems where hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic rocks is possible, in both terrestrial (oceanic hydrothermalism, subduction zones and transform faulting) and extraterrestrial environments. The process of alteration from mafic minerals to serpentine group minerals is called serpentinization. Serpentine minerals are often formed by the hydration of olivine-rich ultramafic rocks at relatively low temperatures (0 to ~600 °C). The chemical reaction turns olivine into serpentine minerals. They may also have their origins in metamorphic alterations of peridotite and pyroxene. Serpentines may also pseudomorphously replace other magnesium silicates. Incomplete alteration causes the physical properties of serpentines to vary widely.

Antigorite is the polymorph of serpentine that most commonly forms during metamorphism of wet ultramafic rocks and is stable at the highest temperatures—to over at depths of or so. In contrast, lizardite and chrysotile typically form near the Earth&#x27;s surface and break down at relatively low temperatures, probably well below . It has been suggested that chrysotile is never stable relative to either of the other two serpentine polymorphs.

Samples of the oceanic crust and uppermost mantle from ocean basins document that ultramafic rocks there commonly contain abundant serpentine. Antigorite contains water in its structure, about 13 percent by weight. Hence, antigorite may play an important role in the transport of water into the earth in subduction zones and in the subsequent release of water to create magmas in island arcs, and some of the water may be carried to yet greater depths.

Occurrence is worldwide, notable localities include New Caledonia, Canada (Quebec), US (northern California, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland and southern Pennsylvania), Afghanistan, Britain (the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall), Ireland, Greece (Thessaly), China, Russia (Ural Mountains), France, Korea, Austria (Styria and Carinthia), India (Assam, and Manipur), Myanmar (Burma), New Zealand, Norway and Italy.

==Uses==
Serpentines find use in industry for several purposes, such as railway ballasts, building materials, and the asbestiform types find use as thermal and electrical insulation (chrysotile asbestos). The asbestos content can be released into the air when serpentine is excavated and if it is used as a road surface, forming a long-term health hazard by breathing. Asbestos from serpentine can also appear at low levels in water supplies through normal weathering processes, but there is as yet no fully proven health hazard associated with use or ingestion, although the EPA states an increased risk of developing benign intestinal polyps can occur. In its natural state, some forms of serpentine react with carbon dioxide and re-release oxygen into the atmosphere.

The more attractive and durable varieties (all of the antigorite) are termed &quot;noble&quot; or &quot;precious&quot; serpentine and are used extensively as gems and in ornamental carvings. The town of Bhera in the historic Punjab province of the Indian subcontinent was known for centuries for finishing a relatively pure form of green serpentine obtained from quarries in Afghanistan into lapidary work, cups, ornamental sword hilts, and dagger handles. This high-grade serpentine ore was known as in Persian, or &#x27;false jade&#x27; in English, and was used for generations by Indian craftsmen for lapidary work. It is easily carved, taking a good polish, and is said to have a pleasingly greasy feel. Less valuable serpentine ores of varying hardness and clarity are also sometimes dyed to imitate jade. Misleading synonyms for this material include &quot;Suzhou jade&quot;, &quot;Styrian jade&quot;, and &quot;New jade&quot;.

New Caledonian serpentine is particularly rich in nickel. The Māori of New Zealand once carved beautiful objects from local serpentine, which they called , meaning &quot;tears&quot;.

The of the Romans, now known as verde antique, or verde antic, is a serpentinite breccia popular as a decorative facing stone. In classical times it was mined at Casambala, Thessaly, Greece. Serpentinite marbles are also widely used: Green Connemara marble (or &#x27;Irish green marble&#x27;) from Connemara, Ireland (and many other sources), and red from Italy. Use is limited to indoor settings as serpentinites do not weather well.

==Potential harm==
Soils derived from serpentine are toxic to many plants, because of high levels of nickel, chromium, and cobalt; growth of many plants is also inhibited by low levels of potassium and phosphorus and a low ratio of calcium/magnesium. The flora is generally very distinctive, with specialized, slow-growing species. Areas of serpentine-derived soil will show as strips of shrubland and open, scattered small trees (often conifers) within otherwise forested areas; these areas are called serpentine barrens.

==Antigorite variety==
Lamellated antigorite occurs in tough, pleated masses. It is usually dark green, but may also be yellowish, gray, brown or black. It has a hardness of 3.5–4 and its luster is greasy. The monoclinic crystals show micaceous cleavage and fuse with difficulty. Antigorite is named after its type locality, the Geisspfad serpentinite, Valle Antigorio in the border region of Italy/Switzerland.

===Bowenite===
Bowenite, a variety of antigorite, is an especially hard serpentine (5.5) of light to dark apple green color, often mottled with cloudy white patches and darker veining. It is the serpentine most frequently encountered in carving and jewelry. The name &#x27;retinalite&#x27; is sometimes applied to yellow bowenite. The New Zealand material is called .

Although not an official species, bowenite is the state mineral of Rhode Island, United States: this is also the variety&#x27;s type locality. A bowenite cabochon featured as part of the &quot;Our Mineral Heritage Brooch&quot;, was presented to U.S. First Lady Mrs. Lady Bird Johnson in 1967.

Williamsite is an American local varietal name for antigorite that is oil-green with black crystals of chromite or magnetite often included. Somewhat resembling fine jade, williamsite is cut into cabochons and beads. It is found mainly in Maryland and Pennsylvania.

===Gymnite===
Gymnite is an amorphous form of antigorite. It was originally found in the Bare Hills of Maryland, and is named from the Greek, , meaning &quot;bare&quot; or &quot;naked&quot;.

==State emblem==
In 1965, the California Legislature designated the mineral serpentine as &quot;the official State Rock and lithologic emblem&quot;.

<doc id="375256" wikidata="Q1191286" url="?curid=375256" title="Successor ordinal">
<text>In set theory, the successor of an ordinal number &quot;α&quot; is the smallest ordinal number greater than &quot;α&quot;. An ordinal number that is a successor is called a successor ordinal. The ordinals 1, 2, and 3 are the first three successor ordinals and the ordinals ω+1, ω+2 and ω+3 are the first three infinite successor ordinals.
==Properties==
Every ordinal other than 0 is either a successor ordinal or a limit ordinal.

==In Von Neumann&#x27;s model==
Using von Neumann&#x27;s ordinal numbers (the standard model of the ordinals used in set theory), the successor &quot;S&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) of an ordinal number &quot;α&quot; is given by the formula

:formula_1

Since the ordering on the ordinal numbers is given by &quot;α&quot; &lt; &quot;β&quot; if and only if &quot;α&quot; ∈ &quot;β&quot;, it is immediate that there is no ordinal number between α and &quot;S&quot;(&quot;α&quot;), and it is also clear that &quot;α&quot; &lt; &quot;S&quot;(&quot;α&quot;).

==Ordinal addition==

The successor operation can be used to define ordinal addition rigorously via transfinite recursion as follows:

:formula_2
:formula_3

and for a limit ordinal &quot;λ&quot;

:formula_4

In particular, . Multiplication and exponentiation are defined similarly.

==Topology==
The successor points and zero are the isolated points of the class of ordinal numbers, with respect to the order topology.

*Limit ordinal
*Successor cardinal

<doc id="375258" wikidata="Q888183" url="?curid=375258" title="Bob Packwood">
<text>Robert William Packwood (born September 11, 1932) is an American retired lawyer and politician from Oregon who served as a member of the United States Senate from 1969 to 1995. He resigned from the U.S. Senate under threat of expulsion, in 1995 after allegations of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and assault of women emerged. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Since the death of Fred R. Harris in November 2024, Packwood is the earliest-serving living U.S. senator, and is the last living former U.S. senator who assumed office in the 1960s.

==Early life and career==
Packwood was born to Frederick William and Gladys Dorothy (Taft) Packwood in Portland, Oregon, graduated from Grant High School in 1950, and in 1954 graduated from Willamette University in Salem.

Packwood is the great-grandson of William Packwood, the youngest member of the Oregon Constitutional Convention of 1857. Packwood had his great-grandfather&#x27;s political bent from his early years. During his undergraduate years, he participated in Young Republican activities and worked on political campaigns, including later Governor and U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield&#x27;s first run for the Oregon House of Representatives. He received the Root-Tilden Scholarship to New York University&#x27;s Law School, where he earned national awards in moot court competition and was elected student body president. After graduating from the NYU Law School in 1957, he was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Portland.

==State legislative career==

In 1960, he was elected Chairman of the Multnomah County, Oregon Republican Central Committee, thus becoming the youngest party chairman of a major metropolitan area in the country. In 1962, he became the youngest member of the Oregon Legislature when he was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives after a campaign waged by what &quot;The Oregonian&quot; called &quot;one of the most effective working organizations in many an election moon in Oregon&quot;. Hundreds of volunteers went door-to-door, distributing leaflets throughout the district, and put up lawn signs that became &quot;literally a geographical feature&quot; of the district. Because of the effectiveness of his own campaigns, Packwood was selected to organize a political action committee that recruited attractive Republican candidates for the Oregon House throughout the state, and trained them in &quot;Packwood-style&quot; campaigning methods. The success of his candidates was credited with the Republican takeover of the Oregon House, thus making Oregon the only state in the Union in which the Republicans were able to score a significant victory in 1964.

Packwood was a member of the Oregon House of Representatives from 1963 to 1968. In 1965, he founded the Dorchester Conference in Seaside, Oregon, an annual political conclave on the Oregon coast that &quot;pointedly ignored state leadership in the Grand Old Party&quot; to bring Republican officeholders and citizens together, to discuss current issues and pass resolutions taking stands on those issues. Initially a forum for liberal politics, it has become an annual networking event for Oregon Republicans.

==U.S. Senator==
In 1968, Packwood was nominated to run for the U.S. Senate in Oregon as the Republican candidate against Democratic incumbent Wayne Morse. Morse had been elected to the Senate as a Republican in 1944 and 1950, then switched parties due to his liberal views, and was easily re-elected as a Democrat in 1956 and 1962. The relatively unknown Packwood was given little chance, but after an 11th-hour debate with the incumbent before the City Club of Portland, which Packwood was generally considered to have won, and a statewide recount in which over 100,000 ballots were challenged by both parties, Packwood was declared the winner by 3,500 votes. Packwood replaced U.S. Senate member Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts as the youngest senator. Packwood was re-elected in 1974, 1980, 1986, and 1992.

Packwood&#x27;s voting record was moderate. He supported restrictions on gun owners and liberal civil rights legislation. Packwood voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a federal holiday, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override Ronald Reagan&#x27;s veto).

Packwood differed with President Richard Nixon on some significant issues. He voted against Nixon&#x27;s Supreme Court of the United States nominees Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell, as well as Nixon&#x27;s proposals for the Rockwell B-1 Lancer, submarines capable of carrying the Trident and the supersonic transport (SST). He became the first U.S. Senate Republican to support the Impeachment process against Richard Nixon, which was unsuccessful. In a White House meeting on November 15, 1973, he told Nixon that the public no longer believed him, and no longer trusted the integrity of the administration.

Two years before the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision by the Supreme Court, Packwood introduced the Senate&#x27;s first abortion legalization bill, but he was unable to attract a co-sponsor for it. His abortion-rights movement stance earned him the loyalty of many feminist groups, and numerous awards, including those from the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (January 10, 1983) and the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus (October 23, 1985). In 1987, Packwood crossed party lines to vote against the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court, and he was one of only two Republicans to vote against the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1991. Both votes were based on the nominee&#x27;s opposition to abortion rights.

He played a major role in the enactment of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area Act, sponsoring a bill which protected scenic Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in North America, by making it into a National Recreation Area on the borders of northeastern Oregon and western Idaho. Environmentalists also praised his advocacy of solar energy, returnable bottles, and bike paths.

Deregulation was another interest of Packwood&#x27;s. In the late 1970s, he became a passionate supporter of trucking deregulation, and a &quot;persuasive spokesman&quot; for reform.

He has been described as an &quot;ardent&quot; pro-Israel supporter. He opposed a sale of F-15s to Saudi Arabia under President Reagan.

He was most noted for his role in the 1986 tax reform, while he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. President Ronald Reagan had proposed the idea of tax reform in 1984, but Packwood&#x27;s initial response was indifferent. However, he played a leading role in fashioning a tax code that would raise business taxes by some $120 billion over five years, and lower personal income taxes by roughly the same amount.

Packwood&#x27;s debating skills were rated A+ by &quot;USA Today&quot; in the issue of July 18, 1986. But his debating and legislative skills could kill bills as well as pass them. His floor management has been credited with killing President Clinton&#x27;s 1993 health care bill. And he could be stubborn; in 1988, he was carried feet-first into the Senate Chamber by Capitol Police for a quorum call on campaign finance reform legislation.

==Resignation==

===Sexual misconduct as a U.S. Senator===
Packwood&#x27;s political career began to unravel in November 1992, when a &quot;Washington Post&quot; story detailed claims of sexual abuse and assault from ten women, chiefly former staffers and lobbyists. Publication of the story was delayed until after the 1992 election, as Packwood had denied the allegations and the &quot;Post&quot; had not gathered enough information about the story at the time. Packwood defeated the Democratic nominee, Representative Les AuCoin, 52.1% to 46.5%–easily his closest race since his initial run for the seat a quarter-century earlier. Eventually, 19 women came forward.

As the situation developed, Packwood&#x27;s diary became an issue. Wrangling over whether the diary could be subpoenaed and whether it was protected by the protection of Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution against self-incrimination ensued. He did divulge 5,000 pages to the United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics but balked when a further 3,200 pages were demanded by the committee. It was discovered that he had edited the diary, removing what were allegedly references to sexual encounters and the sexual abuse allegations made against him. Packwood then made what some of his colleagues interpreted as a threat to expose wrongdoing by other members of Congress. The diary allegedly detailed some of his abusive behavior toward women and, according to a press statement made by Richard Bryan, at that time serving as senator from Nevada, &quot;raised questions about possible violations of one or more laws, including criminal laws&quot;.

===Expulsion recommendation and resignation===
Despite pressure for open hearings from the public and from female Senators, especially Barbara Boxer from California, the Senate ultimately decided against them. The Ethics Committee&#x27;s indictment, running to ten volumes and 10,145 pages, much of it from Packwood&#x27;s own writings, according to a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, detailed the sexual misconduct, obstruction of justice, and ethics charges being made against him. The chairman of the Ethics Committee, Republican senator Mitch McConnell, referred to Packwood&#x27;s &quot;habitual pattern of aggressive, blatantly sexual advances, mostly directed at members of his own staff or others whose livelihoods were connected in some way to his power and authority as a Senator&quot; and said Packwood&#x27;s behavior included &quot;deliberately altering and destroying relevant portions of his diary&quot; that Packwood himself had described in the diary as &quot;very incriminating information&quot;. On September 7, the committee unanimously recommended that Packwood be expelled from the Senate.

The following morning, the committee released its findings. With bipartisan pressure mounting, Packwood announced his resignation from the Senate, saying that he was &quot;aware of the dishonor that has befallen me in the last three years&quot; and his &quot;duty to resign.&quot; Democratic Representative Ron Wyden won the seat in a special election.

After the sexual harassment case came to light, Packwood entered the Hazelden Foundation clinic for alcoholism in Minnesota, blaming his drinking for the harassments.

Four years later, during debate on Impeachment of Bill Clinton, McConnell said that the Republicans knew that it was very likely Packwood&#x27;s seat would fall to the Democrats if Packwood were forced out. However, McConnell said, he and his fellow Republicans felt that it came down to a choice of &quot;retain the Senate seat or retain our honor.&quot;

==After the U.S. Senate==
Soon after leaving the Senate, Packwood founded the lobbying firm Sunrise Research Corporation. The former senator used his expertise in taxes and trade, and his status as a former Senate Finance Committee chairman, to land lucrative contracts with numerous clients, among them being Freightliner Trucks, Marriott International, and the now-defunct Northwest Airlines. Among other projects, he played a key role in the 2001 fight to repeal the estate tax in the United States. In 2015, Packwood returned to the Senate as a witness for the United States Senate Committee on Finance, which was again considering tax reform. He and U.S. Senate member Bill Bradley of New Jersey spoke on the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

<text>The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) is a public research university in Catonsville, Maryland named after Baltimore County. It had a fall 2022 enrollment of 13,991 students, 61 undergraduate majors, over 92 graduate programs (38 master, 25 doctoral, and 29 graduate certificate programs) and the first university research park in Maryland. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity&quot;.

Established as a part of the University System of Maryland in 1966, the university became the first public college or university in Maryland to be inclusive of all races. UMBC has the fourth highest enrollment of the University System of Maryland, specializing in natural sciences and engineering, as well as programs in the liberal arts and social sciences. Its athletic teams are known as the UMBC Retrievers and participate in the America East Conference.

==History==

The planning of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County was first discussed in the 1950s due to the post-World War II baby boom, the expansion of higher education under the GI Bill, and the large amount of growth both in population and industry in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. At this time, the University of Maryland, College Park was the main higher education source in the region, so talks began of adding a branch campus in the Baltimore area. In 1955, Governor Theodore McKeldin issued &quot;The Needs of Higher Education in Maryland,&quot; which recommended the need for university expansion. Three years later, the &quot;Advisory Committee on Higher Education in the State of Maryland&quot; report proposed that the Baltimore branch of the University of Maryland be established as a two-year program, subordinate to the College Park campus. In 1960, the Warfield Commission, appointed by Governor Tawes, issued, &quot;A Plan for Expanding the University of Maryland,&quot; which propelled the idea of creating three additional university centers throughout Maryland.

In 1963, the Maryland Legislature approved the development of several new universities throughout Maryland. By the end of that year, 435 acres were purchased from Spring Grove State Hospital, a psychiatric facility in Catonsville, Maryland. The new campus would be efficiently located in Southwestern Baltimore, and would be able to be accessed from Wilkens Avenue, the Baltimore Beltway and Interstate 95. Architectural design and planning of the new campus was completed at the University of Maryland, College Park. In 1965, Albin Owings Kuhn, an accomplished administrator and professor at College Park was named Vice President of Baltimore Campuses, including both UMBC and the founding campus, University of Maryland, Baltimore. The new campus also included Dr. Homer Schamp of the College Park as the first dean of faculty, David Lewis as the first full-time faculty member and head of Social Sciences, and John Haskell Jr. as the first librarian.

The first classes began on September 19, 1966, with 750 students, 3 buildings, and the older wing of the Biological Sciences building, 45 faculty members, 35 support staff, and 500 parking spaces. As university enrollment increased drastically over the coming years, the university would also coincide with the turbulent changes in society in the 1960s. While undergoing the Civil rights movement and the Vietnam War, UMBC would prove to be a new and different atmosphere with open and peaceful minds during campus protests. In 1971, Albin Owings Kuhn resigned his position as UMBC&#x27;s first chancellor, succeeded by Calvin B. T. Lee. Five years later in 1976, John Dorsey, administrative vice president at the University of Maryland, College Park was appointed as UMBC&#x27;s third chancellor.

By 1980, undergraduate enrollment reached 5,800 students. Also in this year, Homecoming and Quadmania were established as cornerstone events that would become UMBC tradition for years to come. During this decade, the University Center and Sherman Hall were opened, as well as Hillside and Terrace Apartments. In addition, University of Maryland, College Park alum Jim Henson funded the establishment of the Imaging Research Center at UMBC. In 1986, Michael Hooker became chancellor, a post he held until 1992, when he was appointed president of the University of Massachusetts system. In 1988, a proposed merger of UMBC with the University of Baltimore was considered but was voted down by the University System of Maryland Board of Regents.

In 1990, undergraduate enrollment reached over 10,000 students. In 1991, a merger plan between UMBC and the University of Maryland, Baltimore was approved in the Maryland House of Delegates, but was rejected by the Senate. Throughout the last decade of the 20th century, the university opened the Engineering and Computer Science Building and Potomac Hall. UMBC&#x27;s longest-serving president, Freeman A. Hrabowski III, was appointed in 1992. He retired in 2022 and was succeeded by Valerie Sheares Ashby that summer.

The first decade of the 21st century featured many university developments as UMBC approached its 40th anniversary in 2006. Some of these developments included the establishment of the Center for Urban Environmental Research and Education, a new partnership with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to develop the Goddard Earth Science and Technology (GEST) Center, as well as numerous expansions to the campus such as The Commons, the Physics Building, Information Technology &amp; Engineering Building and the Public Policy Building. During this time, UMBC was recognized by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) for being the leading producers of chemistry and biochemistry degrees, and was classified by The Carnegie Foundation as being among the top tier research universities, Doctoral/Research Universities for achieving 50 or more doctoral degrees per year across at least 15 disciplines.

==Academics and research==

UMBC offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in a variety of areas of study. There are 61 majors in 55 distinct programs, 70 minors, and 36 certificate programs offered in its undergraduate program. UMBC&#x27;s Graduate School offers 38 master&#x27;s degree programs, 25 doctoral degree programs, and 29 graduate certificate programs.

==Campus==

===History===

In 1840, the state of Maryland purchased the land where the university is located today. At that time, it was known as the Stabler Estate, owned by the prominent Stabler family of Baltimore County. James P. Stabler, the chief engineer and superintendent of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was connected to the estate. The Baltimore Trade School, an orphan&#x27;s home located on present day Giffen Hill, was established in that same year. The school continued to operate and farm the surrounding acreage up until World War II. The state later added the property to Spring Grove State Hospital, which farmed the land until the university&#x27;s establishment. A few of the original structures were still in use by UMBC for some time, including the Hillcrest Building and a farmhouse. Located off of Walker Avenue, the Hillcrest Building was originally built in 1921 to house patients of Spring Grove State Hospital. The building was historically significant for it was the &quot;first building constructed specifically for the care and treatment of mentally ill prisoners to be built at a state psychiatric hospital anywhere in the United States&quot;. In 1965, the structure was used as UMBC&#x27;s administration building, and later used as the office of residential life and a student union. A common campus urban legend claims that the man that Hannibal Lecter was based on lived in a basement cell of the building. Hillcrest was demolished in 2007 due to toxicity concerns, leaving the farm silo on UMBC Boulevard to be oldest surviving structure on the university&#x27;s campus.

Opened for enrollment in 1966, UMBC was created to serve the overflow of students from the Baltimore area seeking admission to University of Maryland, College Park. From its beginning, the new commuter campus faced a surfeit of problems. Sited on free land taken from a state hospital, the campus was not sponsored or protected by any political constituency. There were already nine other campuses in the metropolitan area. Located a few miles from the University of Maryland, Baltimore campus, there was no chance UMBC could develop the array of professional schools common to research universities. Its County name, an afterthought, was more consistent with two-year schools than a Ph.D. - granting institution. Yet as UMBC continues past its 50th anniversary, it has become a national role model for new American universities. The book &quot;Improbable Excellence: the Saga Of UMBC&quot; chronicles this development.

===Landscape===
UMBC&#x27;s main entrance is approached from Metropolitan Boulevard where there is a UMBC Campus exit that leads to UMBC Boulevard. Soon after the campus exit, UMBC Boulevard intersects Research Park Drive which leads into UMBC&#x27;s Research &amp; Technology Park. UMBC&#x27;s campus is also served by Wilkens Avenue, which provides access to the Baltimore Beltway and Rolling Road. Entrances off of Wilkens Avenue include Hilltop Road and Walker Avenue. Hilltop Road leads towards Catonsville&#x27;s Business District on Frederick Road and Spring Grove Hospital Center. On the other side of the campus, Poplar Avenue gives direct access to Arbutus&#x27;s Business District on East Drive. The campus core is served by Hilltop Circle, which creates a complete circle encompassing the campus.

Academic Row is known to be the central pedestrian concourse and maintenance vehicle highway in the campus that borders along a series of buildings. Beginning south at Administration Drive, the pathway is covered by mature trees on either side. Academic Row is bordered by the Administration Building, the Retriever Activities Center, Janet and Walter Sondheim Hall, Sherman Hall (Previously named Academic IV), University Center, Math and Psychology Building, Biological Sciences Building, and the Meyerhoff Chemistry Building. At the northern end, the walkway is intersected by Schwartz Breezeway leading to the Commons, the university&#x27;s student union. Academic Row terminates at the Albin O. Kuhn Library &amp; Gallery, where multiple paths radiate across Erickson Field towards the Commons, the Physics and Public Policy Buildings, West Hills, Hillside, and Terrace Apartments, as well as additional dormitories.

Taking any of the tree-lined staircases to the next level of campus leads to the ITE, Engineering, and Fine Arts buildings, all of which can also be accessed though shortcuts from any of the multitude of buildings on Academic Row. As of 2015, the new Performing Arts and Humanities building has also been servicing students, which is another short walk up from the Engineering building. New lots have also been constructed outside of the Performing Arts and Humanities building in order to accommodate more commuter students and faculty. Fall of 2015 brings with it two new roundabouts that have been made at the intersection of Administration Drive and Research Park Drive and between Research Park Drive and the entrance ramp on to I-95.

On the southern side of the Commons, a large grassy area known as the Quad is where many student events and activities take place throughout the school year. Another area of student congregation is at UC Plaza in front of the University Center. The University Center houses multiple dining options, the UC Ballroom, as well as additional university event and teaching space.

===Location===

UMBC&#x27;s campus is located on 500 acres. It is approximately 15 minutes from Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor and 60 minutes from Washington, D.C. Baltimore-Washington International Airport is approximately 10 minutes away, as well as Amtrak and Baltimore Light Rail stations (BWI Airport and BWI Business District). In addition, the MARC Penn Line serves the UMBC population at Halethorpe Station, which is located approximately two miles away on Southwestern Boulevard in Arbutus, Maryland. The Halethorpe/Satellite bus transit line transports students to and from the train station. UMBC, three miles outside Baltimore city limits, successfully lobbied the government to use &#x27;Baltimore&#x27; as its address. While its suburban campus has minimal interaction with its surroundings, students variously consider it to be located in the towns of Catonsville (by CDP) or Arbutus (whose street grid it borders). The campus is undercut by a series of tunnels.

Originally UMBC was supposed to be located in Baltimore. However, due to many disputes the university is located in the neighborhood of Southern Catonsville, 1.5 miles south of Catonsville&#x27;s Central Business District along Frederick Road. Catonsville provides a college town atmosphere for UMBC by having numerous restaurants, bars, and other conveniences. The town also provides festivals and farmers&#x27; markets every Sunday from May to November.

UMBC also offers seven undergraduate and four graduate programs at The Universities at Shady Grove, a campus in Rockville, Maryland that is shared by nine Maryland public universities.

===Research and Technology Park===
UMBC Research and Technology Park is a 71-acre development on the campus hosting technology, bioscience and research organizations, many of which are engaged in partnership with the university. The research park, split into two campuses, is the oldest university research park in Maryland. The North Campus focuses primarily on cybersecurity, and includes the Cyber Incubator and a new addition of the CyberHive. The South Campus is a life-science and business incubator, and has graduated over 50 companies through its program. Research Park tenants include the US Geological Survey, US Forestry Service, CardioMed Device Consultants, Audacious Inquiry, Med-IQ, Physician Practice, Inc., Retirement Living TV, Ascentium Corporation, Solvern Innovations, RMF Engineering, Inc., Convergent Technology, Clear Resolution Consulting, Fearless Solutions, Potomac Photonics, and Next Breath.

===Transportation===
UMBC has several bus shuttle lines that are available to UMBC&#x27;s students, faculty, and staff. All but the Wave &#x27;n Ride are free by showing of one&#x27;s campus identification card. The Wave ‘n Ride was historically available to anyone who needs intra-campus transport around Hilltop Circle and UMBC Boulevard, but the service is pending decommission.

In August 2014, service has expanded to two new lines connect the campus to downtown Baltimore. These two lines (Downtown A-B Lines) also connect the campus to the Baltimore Metro Subway by way of Lexington Market Station. The Downtown B Line connects to the Metro as well as MARC Train at Camden Station, and the Baltimore Light Rail by way of Convention Center Station.

The Maryland Transit Administration offers additional service to the UMBC community. Bus lines 35, 77, and 95 offer service to the campus. The MARC Train provides Penn Line rail service two miles from the campus at Halethorpe station, connecting the university to Baltimore and Washington.

The UMBC campus is home to a number of trails for pedestrians and bicyclists as well. Some of these pathways include a walking bridge and path that connects the central campus to the Research Park to the south, as well as an unpaved path from UMBC Boulevard to Selford Road that is frequented by runners and joggers. Nearby, the Short Line Railroad Trail can be accessed through Hilltop Road and Spring Grove Hospital Center. The rail trail provides paved pathway access from downtown Catonsville and Paradise, crossing the Baltimore Beltway. Additionally, cyclists have on-road bike routes from the campus to Halethorpe station via downtown Arbutus.

===Campus police===
UMBC maintains a 24-hour police staff of sworn officers, supplemented by non-sworn security officers and student marshals. Like the campus police of the University of Maryland, College Park and the University of Maryland, Baltimore, the campus police are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. Accreditation is expected by the University System of Maryland mandated 2013 deadline. The UMBC police logs all crime reports and statistics as required by law on the UMBC Police Webpage.

==President==

In May 1992, Freeman A. Hrabowski III began his term as president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. He was named by TIME Magazine as one of the &quot;100 Most Influential People in the World&quot;, and for his work with UMBC was honored as America&#x27;s Top 10 College Presidents in 2009. Under his leadership, UMBC has been ranked the #1 Up and Coming University in the US for six consecutive years (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014) by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; magazine.

On August 1, 2022, following Hrabowski&#x27;s retirement, Valerie Sheares Ashby became president of the university, becoming its first female president.

==Rankings==

The university is ranked tied for 144th in the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings of &quot;National Universities&quot; in the United States, and is ranked tied for 74th nationally among public universities. It was ranked tied for 15th nationally in undergraduate teaching and 14th in innovation. UMBC ranks fourth among U.S. research universities in the production of IT degrees and certificates, according to U.S. Department of Education data. The data shows UMBC ranking #21 in MS, and #31 in PhD IT degree production.

In 2012, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rated UMBC as the 12th most under-performing university, citing a gap between academic reputation and performance in the academic indicators.
The Carnegie Foundation classifies UMBC as a research university with very high research activity.

UMBC has received a rating of 4 out of 5 from Campus Pride&#x27;s LGBT-friendly campus climate index.

==Partnerships==
The university has formed a variety of centers and institutes. It has a partnership with NASA. The Center for Space Science and Technology, Goddard Earth Sciences and Technology Center, and the Joint Center for Earth Systems Technology all are affiliated with the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and share collaboration efforts with the University of Maryland, College Park.

In 2014, the university signed agreements with the United States Army Research Laboratory and the United States Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, for research in information systems, computer science, cybersecurity, networks, sensors, communications, mathematics and statistics, human dimensions, human systems integration, synthetic biology, power, quantum information processing, natural language processing and robotics.

USB and the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) jointly operate the Research &amp; Innovation Partnership Seed Grant program, which aims to promote inter-institutional research collaborations between the two USM institutions and to stimulate joint grant proposals to federal agencies and foundations. This shared program allows students and faculty to receive grants for research, increased collaboration, as well as the ability to use the facilities of both universities.

In February 2015, UMBC formed another partnership with Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan, for research in computer security.

Furthermore, in the spring of 2015 an array of partnerships between UMBC and the US Navy were announced. The two announced the opening of the first Naval ROTC unit in Maryland, on the campus of UMBC, with the US Navy sponsoring a multitude of four year full-ride scholarships for select candidates. In addition, a cybersecurity research partnership between the two institutions was announced, beginning with five collaborative research projects between UMBC faculty and students and the US Navy.

==Sustainability==

In 1997, President Freeman Hrabowski created the Conservation and Environmental Research Areas of UMBC also known as &quot;CERA&quot; on the south end of the campus. The conservation area encompasses 50 acres surrounding Pig Pen Pond and Bwtech@UMBC Research and Technology Park. At the same time as preserving the land, CERA allowed UMBC students to use the land for educational and recreational purposes. CERA contains two parts. The larger tract, covering approximately 45 acres of the south end of the main campus, contains a wide variety of ecological conditions: mature upland forest, early- and mid- successional forest, and riparian and wetland environments. The second, area is much smaller, with an area of about 3 acres. This surrounds Pigpen Pond, which was once actually a pigpen until it filled with water. There are also several areas within CERA where evidence of previous human occupancy and use can be found. In addition to teaching opportunities for faculty, CERA offers a wide range of opportunities for students and faculty to undertake short and long-term research projects in a variety of disciplines. Management of CERA is guided by the need to maintain these landscapes as natural areas to be preserved and protected for approved uses in education, research and wildlife observation.

In 2007, President Freeman Hrabowski signed on to the American College and University President&#x27;s Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) and formed the Climate Change Task Force. 20% of the university&#x27;s emissions comes from renewable energy. Additional sustainable efforts include a green roof on Patapsco Hall, and the construction of new LEED certified buildings such as West Hills Community Center and the Performing Arts and Humanities Building. Preservation has also been a growing focus for UMBC, through the creation of CERA, Conservation Environmental Research Area. &quot;No-mow zones&quot; and stormwater retention ponds have also been added to the campus.

In 2013, UMBC earned Tree Campus USA recognition by the Arbor Day Foundation.

In May 2014, UMBC dedicated 11 acres on the northeastern side of the campus for preservation through the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Also in 2014, the university has opened its first community garden for its students. The garden will give students the chance to grow their own food on campus.

In May 2015, two Prove It! teams went on to win the $10,000 grant for their sustainability driven ideas to improve the life of students. The first, Retriever Treasure, collects unwanted furniture, clothes, and other items from students moving out of dorms and apartments at the end of each school year. They then resell these items at the beginning of the school year to raise funds for other initiatives and donate the remainder of the items not sold. The second, SolarRetrievers, raised an additional $30,000 from UMBC Residential Life, Facilities Management, and The Commons to purchase 4 EnerFusion Solar Power-Dok solar tables. These tables promote the idea of sustainable energy by directly demonstrating how solar panels are used to charge a battery and power devices in areas that normally would not have electricity readily available. The tables are located in the courtyard between Harbor and Chesapeake Hall, The Commons terrace, and two are on the terrace outside of the Retriever Activities Center.

==Mascot==

The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is the state dog of Maryland and has been the mascot of UMBC since weeks after its founding in 1966. The costumed mascot was alternately known as &quot;Fever the Retriever&quot; in the late 1990s. The university also once had a live mascot, upon whom the True Grit statue is based, named Campus Sam. At the beginning of the 2008 fall semester, a Chesapeake Bay retriever puppy was chosen as a new mascot. He attends many athletic events and an online poll was held on the Retriever Activities Center website to choose his name, which was ultimately decided as &quot;Gritty&quot;. The school&#x27;s dining hall is named True Grits.

==Student life==

The Resident Student Association and Student Events Board provide social programming during all academic semesters at UMBC. Over 220 student-run organizations exist on campus.

===LLC (Language Literacy &amp; Culture)===
This unique interdisciplinary doctoral program draws upon faculty from disciplines in the humanities and social sciences from eight departments and programs at UMBC: African Studies; American Studies; Education; English; History; Gender and Women&#x27;s Studies; Modern Languages, Linguistics and Intercultural Communication; and Sociology and Anthropology.

===Student Events Board ===
UMBC holds homecoming in the fall semester during the month of October. Homecoming consists of numerous activities and festivities on campus. Namely, Homecoming includes the 5K Dawg Chase race, and a comedy show. Past performances include Trevor Noah, Jim Gaffigan, B. J. Novak, Nick Offerman, Bo Burnham, and others.

Quadmania serves as the university&#x27;s student festival during the spring semester. The event takes place during April outdoors, near the center of campus on the Quad or Erickson Field. The headliner for the spring of 2012 was Gym Class Heroes. The headliner for the spring of 2013 was Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis and that for the spring of 2014 was Capital Cities.
The 2014 Quadmania was also to have elephant rides, but these were allegedly cancelled due to claims of animal cruelty by some students. In 2015, Kesha performed at the Retriever Activities Center. In spring of 2016, Fetty Wap headlined Quad Mania on April 24.
In the spring of 2017, T-Pain returned to UMBC and headlined the event.

===Greek life===
UMBC has 20 registered sororities and fraternities with nearly 5% of UMBC&#x27;s undergraduate students belonging to one of them.

=== Mock Trial ===
UMBC fields an undergraduate mock trial team within the American Mock Trial Association. As of the 2022–2023 season, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County is ranked #9 in the nation. In 2019, UMBC advanced to the National Championship Tournament, placing eighth in their division. In 2021, UMBC won the American Mock Trial Association (AMTA) National Championship Tournament, defeating Yale University in one of the closest final rounds in AMTA history. In the 2021–2022 season, UMBC again advanced to the National Championship Tournament, but failed to place in their division.

UMBC competitor Sydney Gaskins also competed at Trial by Combat, the one-on-one competition for AMTA competitors hosted by UCLA Law and Drexel Law. As of the 2022 tournament, Gaskins is the only individual to have competed at Trial by Combat three times.

UMBC head coach Benjamin Garmoe hosts the Mock Review, a podcast discussing undergraduate mock trial and associated matters.

==Residential life==

===Campus housing===
There are ten housing areas housing approximately 3,900 students, which are: Potomac Hall, Chesapeake Hall, Erickson Hall, Harbor Hall, Patapsco Hall, Susquehanna Hall, Hillside Apartments, Terrace Apartments, Walker Avenue Apartments, West Hill Apartments.

===Off-campus housing===
Although 71% of first-year undergraduate students are reported to live on campus, UMBC is known as a commuter campus where approximately 65% of the entire student population lives off campus, often in neighboring communities. These students are provided specialized programs and services through the Off Campus Student Services (OCSS) office. Popular locations for students include Catonsville and Arbutus. Popular apartment complexes include the Westland Garden Apartment &amp; Town homes, and the Colony Hill Apartments located 1.5, and 2.5 miles away from campus, respectively. The UMBC Transit lines serves many neighborhoods. Students also live in numerous Baltimore neighborhoods, such as Beechfield, Oaklee, Irvington, Yale Heights, and Edmondson.

==Chess==
UMBC has won the Pan American Chess Tournament 9 times in 13 years (1996–2009). The school provides substantial chess scholarships to outstanding high school graduate players at the International or Grandmaster level. Former UMBC team captain GM Alexander Onischuk has gone on to become US Champion in 2006. Professor of Computer Science Alan Sherman has been instrumental in building up the UMBC chess dynasty by recruiting players from around the world. UMBC hosts two annual open chess tournaments, the UMBC Open (March) and the UMBC Championship (September).

==Athletics==


The Maryland–Baltimore County (UMBC) athletic teams are called the Retrievers. The university is a member of the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the America East Conference since the 2003–04 academic year. The Retrievers previously competed in the Northeast Conference (NEC) from 1998–99 to 2002–03; and in the Big South Conference from 1992–93 to 1997–98; while they also competed in the Mason–Dixon Conference at the NCAA Division II ranks: the first variation of it from 1972–73 to 1977–78; and the second variation from 1983–84 to 1987–88.

UMBC competes in 17 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

===Quick facts===
The school&#x27;s colors are black and gold. The mascot of the university is a Chesapeake Bay Retriever, the state dog of Maryland, named True Grit. Their fight song is the UMBC Riser, and was written by Dr. George LaNoue, a professor of policy sciences.

===Accomplishments===
In 2009, the men&#x27;s lacrosse team secured their fifth consecutive outright or shared America East regular season championship and their third America East tournament championship in four years. UMBC has secured a berth in the NCAA tournament each of the past four seasons. In 2007, the unseeded Retrievers upset seventh-seeded Maryland, 13–9, in the NCAA tournament to advance to the Division I second round for the first, and so far only, time in school history.

In 2010, a contest was launched to find a new logo for Athletics. In May 2010, the UMBC Athletic Department unveiled a new logo for the Retrievers created by Jim Lord.

The school spent $67 million in January 2016 on a new event center completed in Winter 2018. This new event center hosts athletic events such as basketball games, as well as concerts.

The Retrievers’ Men&#x27;s Basketball team, on March 16, 2018, during the 2018 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament became the first No. 16 seed in the history of the competition to defeat a No. 1 seed, defeating the Virginia Cavaliers 74–54. They advanced to the Round of 32 for the first time in school history, where they were eliminated by Kansas State.

===Soccer===
UMBC is the first team in tournament history to win four consecutive road games and to post shutouts in four consecutive games.

UMBC Women&#x27;s Soccer Team went 13–5–2 in their 2013 season, tying for the regular-season conference title then winning the conference tournament. This was their first American East Conference title. They then made their first NCAA tournament appearance in 2013, where they lost to #1-ranked VA Tech 2–0 in the first round. This was an amazing accomplishment considering the team had a cumulative record of 3–39–9 in their previous three years.

<doc id="375260" wikidata="Q964585" url="?curid=375260" title="Len Bias">
<text>Leonard Kevin Bias (November 18, 1963June 19, 1986) was an American college basketball player for the Maryland Terrapins. In the last of his four years playing for Maryland, he was named a consensus first-team All-American. Two days after being selected by the Boston Celtics with the second overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft, Bias died from cardiac arrhythmia induced by a cocaine overdose. In 2021, Bias was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Bias was born and raised in the Prince George&#x27;s County area in Maryland, just outside of Washington, D.C.. He was one of four children born to James Bias Jr. and Dr. Lonise Bias. He had a sister, Michelle, and two brothers, Eric and James III (James III was known as Jay).

Bias graduated from Northwestern High School in Hyattsville, Maryland.

==College career==
Bias attended the University of Maryland. As a freshman for the Terrapins, he was viewed as &quot;raw and undisciplined.&quot; Bias ultimately developed into an All-American player. He led the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in scoring in his junior year and was named the ACC Player of the Year. His senior season was highlighted by his performance in an overtime victory against top-ranked North Carolina, in which he scored 35 points, including seven in the last three minutes of regulation and four in overtime. Bias collected his second ACC Player of the Year award at the end of the year and was named to two All-America teams.

Bias impressed basketball fans with his amazing leaping ability, physical stature and ability to create plays, and he was considered one of the most dynamic players in the nation. By his senior year, scouts from various National Basketball Association teams viewed Bias as the most complete forward in the class of 1986. Celtics scout Ed Badger called Bias an &quot;explosive and exciting kind of player&quot; and compared him to Michael Jordan.

==NBA draft, drug overdose, and death==
On June 17, 1986, Bias was selected by the Boston Celtics as the second overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft, which was held in New York City at Madison Square Garden. Red Auerbach, the Celtics&#x27; president and general manager, had dealt guard Gerald Henderson and cash to the Seattle SuperSonics for the pick in 1984. After the draft, Bias and his family returned to their suburban Maryland home. On June 18, Bias and his father flew to Boston for an NBA club draft acceptance and product endorsement signing ceremony with the Celtics&#x27; coaches and management. Bias had discussions with Reebok&#x27;s sports marketing division regarding a five-year endorsement package worth $1.6 million.

After returning home, Bias returned to the campus of the University of Maryland. He left campus at approximately 2 a.m. on Thursday, June 19, drove to an off-campus gathering and returned to his Washington Hall dormitory between 2:30 and 3 a.m. For the next three to four hours, Bias, with longtime friend Brian Tribble and several teammates, snorted cocaine in the dormitory suite shared by Bias and his teammates. Bias suffered a seizure and collapsed while talking with teammate Terry Long. At 6:32 a.m., when Tribble called 911, Bias was unconscious and not breathing. All attempts by the emergency medical team to restart his heart and breathing were unsuccessful. After additional attempts to revive him at Leland Memorial Hospital in Riverdale, Maryland, Bias was pronounced dead at 8:55 a.m. of a cardiac arrhythmia related to usage of cocaine. It was reported that there were no other drugs or alcohol found in his system. Bias&#x27;s death occurred when crack cocaine was being published across media and his death led to greater coverage, when in reality he died using powdered cocaine. This also helped fuel the war on drugs as politicians began focusing on his death.

More than 11,000 people attended a June 23 memorial service at Cole Field House, the university&#x27;s basketball arena and student center where Bias played for the Terrapins. Those speaking at the service included Auerbach, who said that he had planned to draft Bias for three years. On June 30, 1986, the Celtics honored Bias with a memorial service in which his unused #30 Celtics jersey was given to his mother Lonise.

Bias was interred at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery in Suitland, Maryland.

==Later developments==
===Criminal charges===
On July 25, 1986, a grand jury returned indictments against Brian Tribble for possession of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Bias&#x27;s Maryland teammates Terry Long and David Gregg were charged with possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice. Long and Gregg were suspended from the team on July 31. All three defendants entered not guilty pleas in August.

On October 20, 1986, prosecutors dropped all charges against Long and Gregg in exchange for their testimony against Tribble. On October 30, the grand jury added three more indictments against Tribble—one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice and two counts of obstruction of justice.

Also on October 30, Kenneth Mark Fobbs, Tribble&#x27;s roommate, was charged with perjury for allegedly lying to the grand jury about the last time that he had seen Tribble. The state dropped the perjury charges against Fobbs on March 24, 1987, and a jury acquitted Tribble of all charges related to the Bias case on June 3, 1987.

In October 1990, Tribble pleaded guilty to a drug charge following a two-year undercover sting operation. He cooperated with the government and was sentenced to ten years and one month in prison.

===Family===
On December 5, 1990, Bias&#x27;s younger brother Jay was murdered in a drive-by shooting at age 20. The killing followed a dispute in the parking lot of Prince George&#x27;s Plaza, a Hyattsville shopping mall just a few miles from the University of Maryland. He was pronounced dead at the same hospital where his brother Len had died and was buried next to him at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery.

Following their sons&#x27; deaths, James and Lonise Bias assumed vocal advocacy roles. Lonise Bias became an anti-drug lecturer, while James Bias became an advocate for gun control. Lonise Bias, in the memory of her children, opened the Len and Jay Bias Foundation, which serves to encourage better examples for youth.

===Len Bias Law===
A few weeks after Bias&#x27;s death, committees in the United States House of Representatives began writing anti-drug legislation. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 was signed by President Ronald Reagan on October 27, 1986. The law provides a mandatory minimum prison term of 20 years and a maximum life sentence, along with a fine of up to $2 million, for cases of drug distribution that lead to the death or serious injury of a person. It is also known as the &quot;Len Bias Law.&quot;

===University of Maryland investigation===
The circumstances surrounding Bias&#x27;s death threw the University of Maryland and its athletics program into turmoil. An investigation revealed that Bias was 21 credits short of the graduation requirement despite having attended the university for four full years; in his final semester, he earned no academic credits, failing three courses and withdrawing from two others. On August 26, 1986, state attorney Arthur A. Marshall Jr. stated that in the hours after Bias&#x27;s death, Maryland head basketball coach Lefty Driesell told players to remove drugs from Bias&#x27;s dorm room. Two days later, Bias&#x27;s father James accused the university and Driesell of neglecting their athletes&#x27; academic status.

The controversy prompted athletic director Dick Dull to resign on October 7, 1986, with Driesell following suit on October 29 after 17 years as coach. The grand jury presiding over the Bias case issued a final report on February 26, 1987, criticizing the University of Maryland&#x27;s athletic department, admissions office and campus police.

<doc id="375263" wikidata="Q529294" url="?curid=375263" title="Chuck Grassley">
<text>Charles Ernest Grassley (born September 17, 1933) is an American politician serving as the president pro tempore of the United States Senate. He was also president pro tempore from 2019 to 2021. A member of the Republican Party, Grassley is the senior United States senator from Iowa, serving since 1981. He is in his eighth Senate term. 

Before becoming a senator, Grassley served eight terms in the Iowa House of Representatives (1959–1975) and three terms in the United States House of Representatives (1975–1981). He has served three stints as Senate Finance Committee chairman during periods of Republican Senate majority. Upon the retirement of Orrin Hatch on January 3, 2019, Grassley became the Senate&#x27;s most senior Republican and its president pro tempore. Upon Patrick Leahy&#x27;s retirement in January 2023, Grassley became the most senior member of the Senate. 

At old, Grassley is the oldest sitting United States senator, the longest-serving Republican in congressional history, and the sixth-longest-serving U.S. senator in history. He served as president pro tempore emeritus of the Senate from 2021 to 2025. During his four decades in the Senate, Grassley has chaired the Senate Finance Committee, the Senate Narcotics Caucus, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Senate Aging Committee.

== Early life and education ==
Grassley was born on September 17, 1933 in New Hartford, Iowa. He is the son of Ruth (née Corwin) and Louis Arthur Grassley. Grassley was raised on a farm; his childhood home did not have electricity or indoor plumbing. He graduated from New Hartford Community High School in 1951. At Iowa State Teachers College (now the University of Northern Iowa), he earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1955 and a Master of Arts in political science in 1956. He pursued a Ph.D. in political science at the University of Iowa, but did not complete the degree. During his time as a student, Grassley joined the social-professional Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity.

== Early career ==
In the 1950s, Grassley farmed and worked in factories in Iowa, first as a sheet metal shearer and then as an assembly line worker. From 1967 to 1968, he taught at Charles City College.

Grassley represented parts of Butler County in the Iowa House of Representatives from 1959 to 1975. He then served in the United States House of Representatives from 1975 to 1981.

== U.S. Senate ==

=== Elections ===

==== 1980 ====

Grassley was first elected to the Senate in 1980, defeating Democratic incumbent John Culver.

==== 1986 ====

Grassley was reelected in 1986, defeating the Democratic nominee, attorney John P. Roehrick. He won 98 counties, losing Wapello County.

==== 1992 ====

Grassley was reelected in 1992, defeating Democratic State Senator Jean Hall Lloyd-Jones. He won all 99 counties.

==== 1998 ====

Grassley was reelected in 1998, defeating former State Representative David Osterberg, who won the Democratic nomination unopposed. He won all 99 counties.

==== 2004 ====

Grassley was reelected in 2004, defeating former State Senator Arthur A. Small. He won all 99 counties.

==== 2010 ====

Grassley sought a sixth term in the 2010 election. He was challenged by Democrat Roxanne Conlin, a former United States attorney, and Libertarian John Heiderscheit, an attorney.

Grassley was unopposed in the Republican primary, although conservative Iowans such as Bill Salier and Craig Robinson said he had drifted &quot;too far to the left&quot;.

Grassley was reelected with 718,215 votes to Conlin&#x27;s 371,686. He won 98 counties, losing Johnson County. Heiderscheit received 25,290 votes. Grassley became only the second Iowan to serve six terms in the Senate, the other being William B. Allison.

==== 2016 ====
Grassley sought a seventh term in the 2016 election. He was expected to face a strong challenge from former Democratic lieutenant governor Patty Judge, but won his seventh term with over 60% of the vote as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump won Iowa with over 51% of the vote. He won 98 counties, losing Johnson County again.

==== 2022 ====

In May 2021, Grassley said that he would not decide whether to run for reelection in 2022 until between eight and 12 months before the election. Many believed that an open seat in Iowa would benefit the Democrats as they could convince many Grassley supporters to vote for their nominee. In July 2021, former U.S. representative Abby Finkenauer announced that she would run for the seat regardless of Grassley&#x27;s decision and criticized him and Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell for being &quot;obsessed with power&quot; and not taking a strong stance against those who breached the Capitol in the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

In September 2021, Grassley announced his intention to run for an eighth term. His announcement was viewed as advantageous to Republicans seeking to hold Grassley&#x27;s seat and to retake the Senate majority in 2022. He won the general election, defeating Democratic nominee Michael Franken on November 8, 2022.

=== Tenure ===
==== 1981–1989 ====
In November 1981, Grassley was one of 32 senators to sign a letter to President Reagan supporting Director of the Office of Management and Budget David Stockman. In August 1982, while the Reagan administration tried persuading senators to approve legislation authorizing the creation of a radio station for broadcasting to Cuba, Grassley joined fellow Iowa senator Roger Jepsen and Edward Zorinsky in seeking an amendment to the bill barring the Reagan administration from operating Radio Marti on that frequency or other commercial AM frequencies.

In October 1983, Grassley voted against establishing a legal holiday to commemorate Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s birthday. In 2015, an aide to Grassley said that he voted against the holiday due to an &quot;economic decision both in the cost to the broader economy in lost productivity, and the cost to the taxpayers with the federal government closed&quot;. In 2004, Grassley co-sponsored legislation giving King a posthumous award, which became law on October 25 that year.

On November 1, 1984, Grassley signed a one-page citation of contempt of Congress against Attorney General William French Smith due to Smith&#x27;s not turning over files on an investigation into Navy shipbuilding. Assistant Attorney General Stephen S. Trott called the citation &quot;out of place&quot; since Grassley was not acting at a session of the Judiciary panel he led.

In May 1987, the Senate Appropriations Committee defeated an attempt by Grassley to hasten payments of corn and other feed grain subsidies ahead of the scheduled payment taking place after October 1. Grassley&#x27;s measure was also designed to unravel an accounting device lawmakers had used to make it appear that they were reducing spending for the incoming fiscal year.

In October 1987, during a press briefing, Grassley accused Reagan of being &quot;asleep at the switch&quot; and botching the handling of Robert Bork&#x27;s Supreme Court nomination, adding that Bork&#x27;s nomination had convinced him that the Reagan administration &quot;has been terribly lucky for the last seven years&quot; in other matters, including the economy and foreign policy. Later that month, Grassley likened the groups lobbying against Bork&#x27;s nomination to the McCarthyism of the 1950s: &quot;The big lie is standard operating procedure for some of these groups. All you have to do is repeat the same outrageous charges, and repeat them so often that people believe they are true.&quot; In November, as party leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee met on the Supreme Court nomination of Douglas H. Ginsburg, Grassley released the text of a letter he intended to send to the American Bar Association suggesting the association was dragging its feet in reviewing Ginsburg&#x27;s record. After Ginsburg admitted having smoked marijuana, Grassley said, &quot;You like to think people who are appointed to the Supreme Court respect the law.&quot; Grassley joined Jesse Helms in resisting the nomination of Anthony Kennedy, Reagan&#x27;s next choice for the Supreme Court; he indicated that he would have preferred that Reagan instead nominate Judge Pasco Bowman II or Judge John Clifford Wallace. Grassley expressed distaste for &quot;the people who are committed to changing the judiciary&quot; and taking &quot;the path of least resistance&quot;.

In January 1989, as the Senate voted to schedule a vote within a month on a pay increase, Grassley asked how senators would decline federal program increases &quot;come March and April if the first thing out of the box is a pay raise&quot;. In February, he was one of six senators to testify against the 50% pay increase scheduled to take effect the next week. In October, he was one of nine senators to vote against legislation intended to outlaw flag burning and other forms of flag defacement and joined Bob Dole and Orrin Hatch, the other two Republicans to vote against the bill, in voicing a preference for a constitutional amendment.

==== 1990–1999 ====

In January 1991, Grassley was one of only two Republican senators to vote against joining the international coalition to force Iraq out of Kuwait, the other being Mark Hatfield of Oregon. In August 1991, he became one of six Republicans on the Select Senate Committee on POW-MIA Affairs that would investigate the number of Americans still missing in the aftermath of the Vietnam War following renewed interest. In July 1998, President Bill Clinton listed Grassley among the members of Congress who had made it possible &quot;for me to sign into law today the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act&quot;. On February 12, 1999, Grassley was one of 50 senators to vote to convict and remove Bill Clinton from office.

==== 2000–2009 ====

In May 2001, Grassley met with Democratic senator Max Baucus over the allocation of finances in tax cuts and both reported they were making progress in reaching a bipartisan deal, Grassley adding that the bill would contain all four of the main elements proposed by the Bush administration and the Senate Finance Committee would modify the components of the Bush proposal.

In August 2002, Grassley sent a letter to president and chief executive of the United Way of America Brian Gallagher requesting a detailed explanation on the overseeing of both finances and management of the organization&#x27;s affiliates. Grassley also wrote to chief executive of the United Way of the National Capital Area Norman O. Taylor in regards to allegations of affiliates misappropriating money as well as withholding information the board needed to allow its conducting of oversight.

As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, Grassley has spearheaded many probes into alleged misuse and lack of accountability of federal money. In July 2007, a Grassley-commissioned report was released claiming that more than US$1 billion in farm subsidies were sent to deceased individuals. Grassley was called a &quot;Taxpayer Super Hero&quot; in 2014 by the council for Citizens Against Government Waste. He received a 100 percent rating from the group that year and has a lifetime rating of 78 percent. Grassley was ranked the 5th most bipartisan Senator of the 114th United States Congress and the 7th most bipartisan Senator in the first session of the 115th Congress by the Bipartisan Index, a metric created by the Lugar Center for the Lugar Center and Georgetown&#x27;s McCourt School of Public Policy to rank members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship.

In February 2004, Grassley released an internal report composed by the FBI in 2000 that examined 107 instances of either serious or criminal misconduct by its agents over a 16-year period. In a letter to the FBI, Grassley called the report &quot;a laundry list of horrors with examples of agents who committed rape, sexual crimes against children, other sexual deviance and misconduct, attempted murder of a spouse, and narcotics violations, among many others&quot; and added that the report&#x27;s findings raised questions about whether the FBI handled agents &quot;soon enough and rigorously enough&quot;.

On June 28, 2006, Grassley proposed legislation intended to curb sex trafficking and sexual slavery in the United States by means of strict enforcement of tax laws, for example by requiring a W-2 form be filed for each prostitute managed by a pimp or other employer.

Since 1976, Grassley has repeatedly introduced measures that increase the level of taxation on American citizens living abroad, including retroactive tax hikes. Grassley was eventually able to attach an amendment to a piece of legislation that went into effect in 2006, which increased taxes on Americans abroad by targeting housing and living incentives paid by foreign employers and held them accountable for federal taxes, even though they did not currently reside in the United States. Critics of the amendment felt that the move hurt Americans competing for jobs abroad by putting an unnecessary tax burden on foreign employers. Others felt that the move was only to offset the revenue deficit caused by domestic tax cuts of the Bush Administration.

In March 2009, amid a scandal that involved AIG executives receiving large salary bonuses from the taxpayer-funded bailout of AIG, Grassley suggested that those AIG employees receiving large bonuses should follow the so-called &#x27;Japanese example&#x27;, resign immediately or commit suicide. After some criticism, he dismissed the comments as rhetoric.

In May 2009, Grassley cosponsored a resolution to amend the US Constitution to prohibit flag burning.
When President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party proposed a health reform bill featuring mandated health insurance, Grassley opposed the health insurance mandate, saying that it was a deal breaker. In response to an audience question at an August 12, 2009, meeting in Iowa, about the end-of-life counseling provisions in the House health care bill, , Grassley said people were right to fear that the government would &quot;pull the plug on grandma&quot;. Grassley had previously supported covering end-of-life counseling, having voted for the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which stated: &quot;The covered services are: evaluating the beneficiary&#x27;s need for pain and symptom management, including the individual&#x27;s need for hospice care; counseling the beneficiary with respect to end-of-life issues and care options, and advising the beneficiary regarding advanced care planning.&quot; In December 2009, he voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act). It was later reported that Grassley had notified Obama that he would vote against the Affordable Care Act even had the bill been modified to include all of the proposed modifications Grassley had proposed.

==== 2010–2020 ====
In January 2010, Grassley was one of seven Senate Republicans to sign a letter warning the White House about their serious reservations with Director of the Transportation Security Administration nominee Erroll Southers due to conflicting accounts Southers gave the Senate about his previous tapping of databases for information about his ex-wife&#x27;s boyfriend in the late 1980s.

In December 2010, Grassley was one of 26 senators who voted against the ratification of New START, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads as well as 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.

In April 2013, Grassley opposed a gun control amendment authored by Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey, and instead proposed alternative legislation to increase prosecutions of gun violence and increase reporting of mental health data in background checks.
On March 9, 2015, Grassley was one of 47 senators to sign a letter to Iran led by Tom Cotton to rebuke the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. In June 2015, Grassley introduced legislation to help protect taxpayers from alleged abuses by the Internal Revenue Service. The legislation was proposed in response to recent events involving alleged inappropriate conduct by employees at the IRS but was opposed by Democrats.

Since first taking office in 1981, Grassley has held public meetings in all of Iowa&#x27;s 99 counties each year, even after losing honorarium payments for them in 1994. This has led to the coinage of the term &quot;full Grassley&quot; to describe a presidential candidate visiting all 99 counties of Iowa before the Iowa caucuses.

In 2018, Grassley suggested that no women were serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee because of the heavy workload. The following week, Grassley added that he would &quot;welcome more women&quot; to serve on the Committee &quot;because women as a whole are smarter than most male senators. And they work real hard, too&quot;.

In July 2018, after President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Grassley lauded Kavanaugh as &quot;one of the most qualified Supreme Court nominees to come before the Senate&quot;, and said that critics of Kavanaugh should lessen their confidence in how he would vote given past surprises in voting by members of the Court.

In 2016, Senate Republicans refused to consider Obama&#x27;s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. At the time, Grassley said that the &quot;American people shouldn&#x27;t be denied a voice&quot; in the nomination, which was &quot;too important to get bogged down in politics&quot;. In 2020, after a Supreme Court vacancy arose due to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#x27;s death, Grassley supported a prompt vote on Trump&#x27;s nominee, backing the decision of &quot;the current chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Senate Majority Leader&quot;.

==== 2021–present ====

Grassley was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. He was removed from the Senate chamber and taken to a secure location when rioters entered the building. In the wake of the attack, Grassley said that Trump &quot;displayed poor leadership in his words and actions, and he must take responsibility&quot;. He said efforts to impeach Trump would risk &quot;further disunity&quot; and that &quot;the country must take steps to tone down political rhetoric and mend divisions&quot;. In response, &quot;The Gazette&quot; editorial board wrote that Grassley and other Iowa Republicans &quot;must reckon with why they did the wrong thing for so long&quot;.

=== Senate record for consecutive votes ===
As of November 2015, Grassley had cast 12,000 votes, and as of July 2012, he had missed only 35 votes in his Senate career. In January 2016, he set a record for the most times without a missed roll-call vote, having not missed one since July 1993, when he was touring Iowa with President Bill Clinton to survey flood damage. In November 2020, this streak came to an end after over 27 years and 8,927 votes when he quarantined after being exposed to COVID-19. Grassley broke Senator William Proxmire&#x27;s record for most time without a missed vote, but Proxmire holds the record for most consecutive roll-call votes, with 10,252.

=== Committee assignments ===
Grassley&#x27;s committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:
* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry
** Subcommittee on Commodities, Markets and Trade
** Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy
* Committee on Finance
** Subcommittee on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth (Ranking Member)

=== Caucus membership ===
* Senate Republican Conference

== Political positions ==
=== Abortion ===
Grassley has said that he considers himself pro-life and has expressed concern about the potential for abortions to be paid for with federal funds. In December 1981, he voted for a proposed constitutional amendment by Orrin Hatch that would allow both Congress and the states to ban or regulate abortion. In 2019, he co-sponsored reintroducing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Grassley approved of the 2022 overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, saying it empowered people through their elected representatives to make &quot;commonsense policy decisions&quot;.

=== Agriculture ===
In April 2019, Grassley was one of seven senators to sign a letter led by Debbie Stabenow and Joni Ernst to United States secretary of agriculture Sonny Perdue urging the Agriculture Department to implement conservation measures in the 2018 Farm Bill &quot;through a department-wide National Water Quality Initiative, which would build off the existing initiative housed at the Natural Resource Conservation Service&quot;.

=== Antitrust ===
In October 2021, Grassley and Senator Amy Klobuchar introduced the American Innovation and Choice Online Act (S.2992) . The legislation aims to prevent Big Tech companies from engaging in anti-competitive behavior by &quot;self-preferencing&quot; their products. Grassley voted to confirm Jonathan Kanter as Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice Antitrust Division.

=== Energy and environment ===
Grassley has expressed concern about the impact of regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency on farming. He said the EPA has a &quot;public relations problem&quot; with &quot;the ethanol industry, corn farmers and [himself]&quot;, and that the EPA has &quot;screwed&quot; farmers with 31 biofuel exemptions. On December 19, 2019, after the EPA withdrew a new Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) rule, Grassley criticized the EPA for &quot;playing games and not helping President Trump with farmers&quot;.

In 1992, Grassley authored EPACT 1992, which created the federal wind energy tax credit.

In 2005, Grassley authored the tax title of EPACT 2005 when he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. On June 28, 2005, he voted for the bill. On June 19, 2007, Grassley helped expand tax incentives that produces energy from alternative sources including ethanol, wind, biomass, and biodiesel. On June 21, 2007, Grassley voted for the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which expanded other energy tax incentives through 2013.

In September 2015, Grassley received the Dr. Harold D. Prior &quot;Friend of Iowa Wind Energy&quot; award from the Iowa Wind Energy Association for his commitment to supporting wind energy development in Iowa.

In 2017, the Environmental Working Group stated that Grassley received $367,763 in grain commodity subsidies over 21 years.

Grassley supports federal ethanol subsidies.

In 2017, of the Paris Agreement, Grassley said, &quot;unequal terms put the U.S. economy at a significant disadvantage while letting large economies like China’s and India’s off the hook&quot;. He also said he didn&#x27;t like that the Senate had not voted on the agreement.

=== Estate taxes ===
Grassley is in favor of repealing the estate tax, which is a tax on inherited assets above $5.5 million for individuals and $11 million for couples. He has argued that the estate tax is potentially ruinous for farmers and small business owners. According to the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot;, Grassley&#x27;s argument does not &quot;match the reality found in federal tax data – particularly for Iowa. The estate tax applies to around 5,000 taxpayers across the entire country each year, and very few of them come from Iowa. Of the Iowans subject to the tax, only a fraction are actually farmers, and a vanishingly small number of them face a tax bill requiring them to sell off farmland or other assets... The number of small businesses impacted by the estate tax is similarly small.&quot;

=== Gun law ===

In 2010, Grassley had an &quot;A&quot; rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF), rising to &quot;A+&quot; ratings and endorsements in 2016 and 2022. According to a source from Splinter News, Grassley received $9,900 from the NRA during his 2016 election.

Grassley is a staunch believer that gun laws will not prevent gun deaths or gun-related violence without improved mental health care. Grassley opposed the Manchin-Toomey gun control amendment, and instead proposed alternative legislation to increase prosecutions of gun violence and increase reporting of mental health data in background checks.

In 2016, one month after the Orlando nightclub shooting, Grassley proposed legislation to expand state-to-state access to background check data and to make it illegal for government officials to sell criminals guns as part of sting operations. Both proposals were rejected by the Senate. Additionally, he voted against the Democrats&#x27; Feinstein Amendment, which would make it illegal to sell guns to individuals on the terror watchlist and a Republican-sponsored bill that expanded funding for background checks.

In early 2017, Grassley sponsored legislation that expanded access to firearms by mentally disabled individuals, claiming that the previous ban against mentally ill individuals purchasing guns &quot;mistreats disabled Americans&quot;. In response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, he said it was unlikely that gun laws would change in the wake of the shooting due to Congress being Republican-dominated. A day after the Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, Grassley said the government had not done enough to prevent individuals with a mental illness from obtaining firearms.

=== Health care ===
Grassley opposes the Affordable Care Act and has voted to repeal it. Before its passage, he had supported the individual mandate in health care reform. Grassley engaged in lengthy negotiations with the Obama administration, as it sought health care reform with support from Republican members of Congress. These negotiations produced nothing that Grassley would support, leading Democrats to characterize Grassley&#x27;s efforts as intended to delay or scupper health care reform rather than produce compromise legislation. In Obama&#x27;s memoir, he describes an exchange between him and Grassley in the Oval Office as he sought to reach a compromise with Grassley. Obama asked, &quot;If Max [Baucus] took every one of your latest suggestions, could you support the bill?... Are there &quot;any&quot; changes—any at all—that would get us your vote?&quot;, to which Grassley responded, &quot;I guess not, Mr. President.&quot;

In July 2017, Grassley said that Senate Republicans should be ashamed of not having repealed the ACA, and that this could result in a loss of their majority in the 2018 elections.

In August 2018, Grassley was one of ten Republican senators to cosponsor legislation intended to protect ACA provisions for people with preexisting conditions. Health experts said the bill did not prevent insurers from excluding coverage for people with preexisting conditions.

=== Marijuana legalization ===
In 2015, Grassley voiced his opposition to a bipartisan senate bill, the Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act, that would move cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule II. This bill would allow states with medical cannabis laws to legally prescribe it and allow for more research into its medical efficacy. In 2019, along with Democratic U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Brian Schatz, Grassley introduced the Cannabidiol and Marijuana Research Expansion Act, which would expand research into medical marijuana.

=== Military ===
Grassley has voiced objections to the Special Immigrant Visa program, which resettles translators and their family members who face risks to their lives due to their work with the U.S. Military.

=== Israel Anti-Boycott Act ===
In April 2017, Grassley co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government. In 2019, Grassley was one of 14 Republican senators to sign a letter from Marco Rubio that involved condemning the BDS movement.

=== LGBT rights ===
In 2015, after the Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, Grassley released a statement saying he believed marriage was between one man and a woman and criticized the court for not leaving the issue up to the states. But in 2022, he said in a statement that he supports same-sex marriage. Despite this, Grassley voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, citing religious liberty concerns and calling the legislation unnecessary.

=== Retirement planning ===
In 2019, Grassley was one of the lead Senate co-sponsors of the SECURE Act of 2019. This bill, which became law as part of the fiscal year 2020 federal appropriations law signed in late December 2019, was intended to incentivize retirement planning, diversify the options available to savers, and increase access to tax-advantaged savings programs including 529 plans.

=== Russian interference in 2016 elections ===

In February 2017, Grassley said that while Russian interference in U.S. elections was &quot;bothersome&quot;, the United States did not have clean hands and had, for instance, interfered with the 1948 Italian election. In May 2017 after Trump fired FBI director James Comey, Grassley advised people suspicious of the Trump administration to &quot;Suck it up and move on.&quot;
On October 31, 2017, while a group of Republicans were facing questions from reporters concerning recent indictments, Grassley ignored the questions and left the room.

In January 2018, and in the first known congressional criminal referral in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Grassley, along with Lindsey Graham, recommended charges against Christopher Steele, one of the people who sought to expose Russian interference. Grassley and Graham said that they had reason to believe that Steele had lied to federal authorities. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;It was not clear why, if a crime is apparent in the F.B.I. reports that were reviewed by the Judiciary Committee, the Justice Department had not moved to charge Mr. Steele already. The circumstances under which Mr. Steele is alleged to have lied were unclear, as much of the referral was classified.&quot;

In January 2018, when Grassley and Judiciary Committee Republicans were refusing to release the full transcript of an August 2017 ten-hour interview that the Judiciary Committee had conducted with Glenn Simpson, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, released the full transcript unilaterally. Simpson is the co-founder of the political opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which produced the so-called Steele Dossier on alleged connections between Trump and Russia. Grassley condemned Feinstein, saying that her decision was &quot;confounding&quot; and that it deterred future witnesses in the Russia 2016 investigation. Simpson himself had requested that the full transcript of his interview be released, saying that Republicans had selectively leaked portions of the testimony to conservative media outlets in order to portray Simpson in a negative light and discredit the Steele dossier.

=== Trade ===
In January 2018, Grassley was one of 36 Republican senators to sign a letter to President Trump requesting he preserve the North American Free Trade Agreement by modernizing it for the economy of the 21st century.

=== Whistleblowers ===
The author of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Grassley has campaigned to increase protection and provide support for &quot;whistleblowers&quot;. He has supported a number of FBI whistleblowers, including Coleen Rowley, Sibel Edmonds, and Jane Turner, although not supporting Department of Defense whistleblower Noel Koch.

Grassley received a lifetime achievement award on May 17, 2007, from the National Whistleblower Center.
In April 2014, Grassley announced plans to create a caucus in the Senate dedicated to strengthening whistleblower protections.

Grassley defended the whistleblower in the Trump–Ukraine scandal, breaking with his party line, when he declared on October 1, 2019, that the whistleblower &quot;appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected&quot;.

After whistleblowers Colonel Alexander Vindman and Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified against Donald Trump and were subsequently fired, Grassley defended Trump&#x27;s firing of both whistleblowers on the grounds that their firing was not retaliatory.

===Donald Trump===
On May 28, 2021, Grassley voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Later that year, Grassley campaigned with Donald Trump.

=== Joe Biden ===

After President Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race on July 21, 2024, Grassley posted on X, &quot;The American ppl are sick &amp; tired of the Biden-Harris open border policies + high cost of living crushing family budgets. A change in candidate doesn&#x27;t fool anyone Changing horses midstream isn&#x27;t going to stop the bad policies +reckless agenda at the top of the Democrat ticket&quot;.

== Investigations ==
=== Religious organizations ===

On November 5, 2007, Grassley announced an investigation into the tax-exempt status of six ministries under the leadership of Benny Hinn, Paula White, Eddie L. Long, Joyce Meyer, Creflo Dollar, and Kenneth Copeland by the United States Senate Committee on Finance. In letters to each ministry, Grassley asked for the ministries to divulge specific financial information to the committee to determine whether or not funds collected by each organization were inappropriately utilized by ministry heads. By the December 6, 2007 deadline, only three of the ministries had shown compliance with the Finance Committee&#x27;s request. On March 11, 2008, Grassley and Finance chairman Max Baucus sent follow-up letters to Kenneth Copeland, Creflo Dollar and Eddie Long, explaining that the Senate reserved the right to investigate the finances of their organizations under federal tax laws.

=== Medical research ===
Grassley also began an investigation about unreported payments to physicians by pharmaceutical companies. He led a 2008 Congressional investigation that found that well-known university psychiatrists, who had promoted psychoactive drugs, had violated federal and university regulations by secretly receiving large sums of money from the pharmaceutical companies that made the drugs. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Joseph Biederman of Harvard University had failed to report over $1 million of income he had received from pharmaceutical companies. Weeks later, Grassley alleged that Alan Schatzberg, chair of psychiatry at Stanford University, had underreported his investments in Corcept Therapeutics, a company he founded. Schatzberg had reported only $100,000 investments in Corcept, but Grassley said his investments actually totaled over $6 million. Schatzberg later stepped down from his grant, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Similarly, Charles Nemeroff resigned as chair of the psychiatry department at Emory University after failing to report a third of the $2.8 million in consulting fees he received from GlaxoSmithKline. At the time he received these fees, Nemeroff had been principal investigator of a $3.9 million NIH grant evaluating five medications for depression manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.

In 2008, for the first time, Grassley asked the American Psychiatric Association to disclose how much of its annual budget came from drug industry funds. The APA said that industry contributed 28% of its budget ($14 million at that time), mainly through paid advertising in APA journals and funds for continuing medical education.

=== Fundraising ===
According to the nonpartisan OpenSecrets, in 2010, the industries that have been the largest contributors to Grassley during his political career are health professionals ($1 million in contributions), insurance industry ($997,674), lawyers/law firms ($625,543) and pharmaceuticals/health products ($538,680). His largest corporate donors have been Blue Cross Blue Shield (insurance), Amgen (biotech company) and Wells Fargo (bank).

Grassley is a member of the Family, the organization that organizes the National Prayer Breakfast. His grandson, Pat Grassley, is a member of the Iowa House of Representatives. Grassley is also known for his widely reported, long-running &quot;feud&quot; with the History channel; he has consistently accused the network of featuring little actual history programming.

According to OpenSecrets, Grassley&#x27;s net worth was more than $7.5 million as of 2018.

=== Health ===
In 2023, Grassley fell at his DC town home. On January 11, he underwent surgery to fix a hip fracture. On February 1, he returned to the Senate, using a wheelchair. He was hospitalized for an infection on January 16, 2024, and released on January 18.

=== Awards ===
In 2003, Grassley&#x27;s alma mater, the University of Northern Iowa, selected him for &quot;honoris causa&quot; membership in Omicron Delta Kappa, the National Leadership Honor Society. In 2009, the National Center for Health Research gave Grassley the Health Policy Hero award for his 2004 oversight of legislative reforms and accountability of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 2010, &quot;The Hill&quot; named Grassley and Max Baucus the hardest-working members of Congress.

<text>Little, Big: or, The Fairies&#x27; Parliament is a contemporary fantasy novel by John Crowley, published in 1981. It won the World Fantasy Award in 1982.

==Plot==

Turn-of-the-century American architect John Drinkwater begins to suspect that within this world there lies another (and within that, another and another ad infinitum, each larger than the world that contains it). Towards the center is the realm of the fairies, which his wife, the Englishwoman Violet Bramble, can see and talk with. Drinkwater gathers his thoughts into an ever-evolving book entitled &quot;The Architecture of Country Houses&quot;. Drinkwater designs and builds a house called Edgewood north of New York City. It is a composite of many styles, each built over and across the others, supposedly as a ″sampler″ for customers thinking about employing Drinkwater&#x27;s firm. It has the effect of disorienting visitors and somehow protecting the family, and it proves to be a door leading to the outer realm of Faerie.

At the beginning of the story, well after the deaths of Drinkwater and his wife, their great-granddaughter Daily Alice falls in love with and marries a stranger, ″Smoky″ Barnable, who she meets at the home of her City cousin George Mouse. Smoky gradually realizes that Alice and her sister Sophie claimed to have seen fairies when they were younger and that they and their family see their history as ″the Tale″.

In a flashback, it is revealed that many of the residents of the area surrounding Edgewood are descended from John and Violet&#x27;s son August, who struck a bargain with the fairies that granted him a power over women&#x27;s hearts matched by their own power over his.

Alice and Smoky have three daughters, Tacey, Lily and Lucy, and a son, Auberon. After an affair with Smoky, Sophie gives birth to a daughter, Lilac. She says Smoky is Lilac&#x27;s father, but it is actually George Mouse. Lilac is stolen by the fairies and replaced with a changeling.

Alice and Sophie&#x27;s great-aunt Nora Cloud regularly consults an ancient set of tarot cards to find out about such mundane matters as the weather or how soon a visitor will be arriving at the house. Smoky&#x27;s instructions for his journey to Edgewood to marry Alice were based on one of Nora&#x27;s card readings. Sophie learns how to use them from Aunt Cloud.

The story moves forward to Auberon as a young man venturing to ″the City″ (Manhattan), where he stays in George Mouse&#x27;s gigantic ruinous compound of Old Law tenements, which Mouse has converted into a farmstead. The City is near collapse and rife with crime and poverty. Auberon falls in love with a striking and vivacious young Puerto Rican woman named Sylvie. They live together until Sylvie is lured away into Faerie. Inconsolable at her departure, Auberon takes to drink.

At this juncture, Russell Eigenblick, a charismatic and secretive politician, rises in popularity and becomes the President of the United States. He advocates civil war, but against what or who is unclear. He is opposed by a covert group of wealthy businessmen and politicians called the Noisy Bridge Rod and Gun Club. They are working with the mage Ariel Hawksquill, a distant relation of the Drinkwater family. Hawksquill divines that Eigenblick is the re-awakened Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and that he has been called from sleep to protect Faerie. Although he has not realized it, his enemy is humanity, which has unknowingly driven the fairies deeper and deeper into hiding. She announces this to the Club, but the members have decided to proceed without her. She becomes Eigenblick&#x27;s adviser.

Hawksquill meets Auberon and teaches him architecture-based techniques of the art of memory. She recognizes that the cards he mentions are the pack that Eigenblick seeks, as they were made to foretell his return, and she induces him to tell her how to get to Edgewood. In return she gives him her key to a private park (designed by his great-great-grandfather), where he practices the art of memory on his time with Sylvie.

He sinks further into alcoholism. After a drunken sexual encounter with Sylvie’s brother Bruno, which Auberon considers a degradation, he lives on the streets. Eventually Lilac appears to him and persuades him to begin a recovery. He moves back into George Mouse’s farm and becomes the writer for a soap opera, taking much of his material from his grandfather ″Doc″ Drinkwater’s animal stories for children and his mother’s letters with stories of her extended family.

Hawksquill goes to Edgewood, where she steals Sophie’s tarot cards, recognizing that they are somehow the map describing the route into Faerie. She returns to the City and tries to stop Eigenblick, but it is too late and Eigenblick has her killed. He then disappears and the country falls into a low-key civil war.

The fairies, who can see the future but remember little of the past, understand the peril they are in but forget why, and they prepare to go deeper into the realms of Faerie; however, this cannot happen unless the extended family of the Drinkwaters comes to the mysterious ″Fairies’ Parliament″. Lilac visits Sophie and Daily Alice, and Auberon and George, summoning them to that event.

Alice leaves first to find or create the way to Faerie. On Midsummer’s Day, the rest of the family assembles at Edgewood including Auberon and George. At the last minute, Smoky – who never really believed in Faerie – chooses not to go, instead devoting himself to finishing the repair of Edgewood′s old orrery, which drew energy from the stars to power the home. He succeeds, and is persuaded by Sophie to accompany the family, but he dies of a heart attack before he leaves the borders of Edgewood. The remaining family members walk into the new realm and take the fairies’ place, Smoky’s funeral turns into Auberon and Sylvie’s wedding, and thus the Tale is finally completed.

The book ends with a description of the empty Edgewood as it decays and returns to nature. The house becomes a legend, because it continues to have lights shining even though electricity is scarce in the rest of the country.

==Characters==
*Evan S. &quot;Smoky&quot; Barnable – One of the novel&#x27;s protagonists, whose marriage to the Drinkwater family is prophesied long before it occurs. He succeeds the first Auberon (below) as a schoolteacher.
*Alice Dale Drinkwater, known as Daily Alice – Smoky’s wife, Sophie’s sister and Auberon&#x27;s mother. She is likewise assured of her destiny from a young age by Nora Cloud.
*Auberon Barnable (the second Auberon) – Smoky’s son, and the second protagonist, who eventually leaves for the city to seek a destiny distinct from Edgewood and the interconnected Drinkwater clan.
*Sylvie – A Stateside Puerto Rican worker at George Mouse’s farm. She was George’s lover but breaks up with him just as Auberon arrives. She can see the brownie who works at the farm and thinks of her as his queen. Her and her brother’s stories carry extended references to Lewis Carroll’s &quot;Sylvie and Bruno&quot;.
*Sophie Drinkwater – Alice’s sister. After Alice&#x27;s departure, she leads the walk to Faerie.
*Lilac (surname not used) – Sophie’s daughter, ostensibly by Smoky but actually by George Mouse. After being stolen by the fairies, she occasionally appears to Auberon, but no one else sees her till near the end of the story.
*Violet Bramble – Ancestor of the Drinkwater clan. As a young unmarried woman in England, she is found to be pregnant by an unknown partner shortly after her father becomes active in the Theosophical Society. At one of their meetings she meets the first John Drinkwater. She later moves to America and marries him. Violet frequently goes to meet the fairies both from her father’s home in England and from Edgewood. She is the first to use the magical tarot cards to see the future.
*John Drinkwater (the first John Drinkwater), architect and later author of &quot;The Architecture of Country Houses&quot;. He is fascinated by what his wife tells him about the fairies she sees.
*Doctor John Storm ″Doc″ Drinkwater (the second John Drinkwater) – August Drinkwater&#x27;s son with Amy Meadows; Alice and Sophie&#x27;s father. He can understand the speech of animals and writes children&#x27;s books that are a fictional version of the stories of Thornton Burgess.
*August Drinkwater – Violet Bramble′s son, who enters into a pact with fairies, giving him power to make women fall in love with him, in exchange for his theft of Violet Bramble′s cards, which he returns to the fairies. His power over each girl he seduces is based on his love for her, which drives him to desperation, and he attempts to drown himself in a pond, but is transformed into a trout trapped in the pond. As &quot;Grandfather Trout&quot; he can speak and serves as a conduit for the Drinkwaters to communicate with Faerie. After his transformation, the tarot cards are returned to the Drinkwaters, but subtly altered. Many of the later residents of the five nearby small towns are his illegitimate descendants. At the very end of the Tale the leader of the fairies tells him he will be restored to human form when one of his loves, Marge Juniper, now elderly, comes to his pond and speaks to him.
*Auberon Drinkwater (the first Auberon) – Alice’s eccentric great-uncle, the son (by Oliver Hawksquill) who Violet was pregnant with when she met John Drinkwater. He cannot see or communicate with fairies, but attempts to record them, with variable success, by photographing them with his nieces Alice and Sophie as ″mediums″ of a sort, reminiscent of the Cottingley Fairies and of photos of children taken by Lewis Carroll. He is the teacher of the school for the children of the Edgewood area and spends his life in pursuit of concrete evidence of fairies, and in analysis of his findings.
*George Mouse – Smoky’s friend who introduces Smoky to his cousins, the Drinkwater family.
*Ariel Hawksquill – A powerful magician who studies the rise of Russell Eigenblick. Granddaughter of Violet Bramble’s first lover, Oliver Hawksquill.
*Russell Eigenblick – The despotic president of the United States, late in the history of the family. He is revealed to be the former Holy Roman Emperor, awakened from 800 years&#x27; sleep.
*Aunt Nora Cloud – Widow of Henry Cloud, expert card reader and one of the family′s chief oracles.

==Literary significance==
Harold Bloom included this work in his book &quot;The Western Canon&quot;, calling it &quot;A neglected masterpiece. The closest achievement we have to the Alice stories of Lewis Carroll.&quot; Bloom also recorded that, based on their correspondence, poet James Merrill &quot;loved the book.&quot;

Thomas M. Disch described &quot;Little, Big&quot; as &quot;the best fantasy novel ever. Period.&quot; Ursula K. Le Guin wrote that &quot;Little, Big&quot; is &quot;a book that all by itself calls for a redefinition of fantasy.&quot; In &quot;Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels&quot;, David Pringle described the book as &quot;a work of architectonic sublimity&quot; and wrote that &quot;the author plays with masterly skill on the emotional nerves of awe, rapture, mystery and enchantment.&quot; Paul Di Filippo said, &quot;It is hard to imagine a more satisfying work, both on an artistic and an emotional level&quot;.

Praise for the book has not been unanimous, however. Reviewing the novel for &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, John Domini termed it &quot;a betrayal of nearly all its promises. The book may declaim continually, in reference to Fairy Land, that &#x27;the farther in you go, the bigger it gets,&#x27; but this flabby tale gets less and less muscular as we peel back page after unnecessary page. Its failure, regrettably and oddly, is at heart one of imagination.&quot;

A number of readers and critics have described &quot;Little, Big&quot; as magical realism, perhaps in an attempt to defend it from being categorized as a work belonging to the sometimes maligned field of genre fiction. However, the novel fits the classic description of low fantasy. Some list it among the early works of urban fantasy or at least as a &quot;classic&quot; part of the movement that developed into it.

<doc id="375268" wikidata="Q465617" url="?curid=375268" title="Tom Harkin">
<text>Thomas Richard Harkin (born November 19, 1939) is an American lawyer, author, and politician who served as a United States senator from Iowa from 1985 to 2015. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously was the U.S. representative for Iowa&#x27;s 5th congressional district from 1975 to 1985. He is the longest-serving senator to spend the entire tenure as a state&#x27;s junior senator.

Born in Cumming, Iowa, Harkin graduated from Iowa State University and The Catholic University of America&#x27;s Columbus School of Law. He served in the United States Navy as an active-duty jet pilot (1962–1967). After serving as a congressional aide for several years, he made two runs for the U.S. House of Representatives, losing in 1972 but winning in 1974. He went on to serve five terms in the House.

Harkin won a race for U.S. Senate in 1984 by a wide margin. He was an early frontrunner for his party&#x27;s presidential nomination in 1992, but he dropped out in support of eventual winner Bill Clinton. He served five Senate terms and at the end of his time in the Senate served as chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. He authored the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and was its chief sponsor in the Senate. Harkin delivered part of his introduction speech in sign language, saying it was so his deaf brother could understand.

On January 26, 2013, Harkin announced that he would not seek reelection in 2014.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Harkin was born in Cumming, Iowa. His father, Patrick Francis Harkin, an Irish American, was a coal miner, and his mother, Franciska &quot;Frances&quot; Valentine (née Berčič), was a Slovene immigrant who died when he was ten. Harkin has three half-siblings on his mother&#x27;s side from her first marriage in Iowa to fellow Slovenian Valentine Brelih. Frances was born in Suha, Slovenia to Jakob and Marija (born Jugovec). He still maintains his childhood house, where he and his five siblings were raised without hot running water or a furnace. He attended Dowling Catholic High School which is currently located in West Des Moines, Iowa.

Harkin attended Iowa State University on a Navy ROTC scholarship and became a member of Delta Sigma Phi fraternity. He graduated with a degree in government and economics in 1962, and served in the United States Navy as an active-duty jet pilot from 1962 to 1967. Harkin was stationed at Naval Air Facility Atsugi in Japan, where he ferried aircraft to and from the airbase that had been damaged in the Vietnam War and in operational and training accidents. He was also stationed for a time at Guantanamo Bay, where he flew missions in support of U-2 planes reconnoitering Cuba. After leaving active duty in 1967, he spent three years in the Ready Reserves, and transitioned into the Naval Reserves in 1970. He retired in 1989 with the rank of commander.

In 1969, Harkin moved to Washington, D.C., and began work as an aide to Democratic U.S. Congressman Neal Smith. During his work for Smith, he accompanied a congressional delegation that went to South Vietnam in 1970. Harkin published photographs he took during the trip and a detailed account of the &quot;Tiger cages&quot; at Côn Đảo Prison in &quot;Life Magazine&quot; on July 17, 1970. The account exposed shocking, inhumane conditions and treatment to which prisoners were subjected. He received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from The Catholic University of America&#x27;s Columbus School of Law in 1972.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1972, the same year that he graduated from law school, Harkin returned to Iowa and immediately ran against an incumbent Republican Congressman, William J. Scherle. Scherle represented the southwestern portion of Iowa, which (with one brief exception) had not elected a Democrat to Congress since the end of the Great Depression. While winning a higher percentage of votes than any of Scherle&#x27;s previous opponents, Harkin nevertheless lost the race.
After his 1972 defeat, Harkin practiced law in Ames before seeking a rematch against Scherle in 1974. In what was generally a bad year for Republicans due to the Watergate scandal, Harkin defeated Scherle by only 3,500 votes. He was re-elected four more times from without serious difficulty.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===

In 1984, Harkin won the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate and defeated freshman Republican Roger Jepsen by 152,502 votes. He was re-elected in 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008.

===Tenure===
Harkin served in the Senate longer than any Democrat in Iowa&#x27;s history. In 2009, he passed Neal Edward Smith as the longest-serving Democrat in either chamber from Iowa. Notably, he spent his entire tenure as Iowa&#x27;s &quot;junior&quot; Senator, due to his colleague Chuck Grassley having served in the chamber since 1981. He and Grassley had a fairly good relationship, despite their often sharp ideological differences, and their seniority made Iowa influential in national politics. Indeed, during his tribute to Harkin shortly before his departure, Grassley got notably choked up as Harkin entered the chamber.

Harkin and Barbara Boxer were the only Senate Democrats to support Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold&#x27;s 2006 resolution to censure President George W. Bush.

Harkin (in addition to U.S. Senators Dick Lugar, Tim Johnson, Byron Dorgan, Joe Biden and Norm Coleman), introduced the BioFuels Security Act (S. 2817/109th) on March 16, 2006.

Harkin came out in favor of the Fairness Doctrine during an interview with Bill Press. (February 11, 2009)

Harkin has been influential in increasing research funding for alternative medicine. He was instrumental in the creation of the U.S. Office of Alternative Medicine in 1992, which later became the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. His efforts and the center&#x27;s results, however, have been criticized.

On July 16, 2013, Harkin introduced the Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act (S. 1302; 113th Congress) into the Senate. The bill would make changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to alter the funding requirements of certain private pension plans that are maintained by more than one employer where the employers are either cooperatives or charities. The bill would make permanent an existing exemption from the Pension Protection Act of 2006 for a few small groups.

On November 19, 2013, Harkin introduced the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period. The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House.

====Social policy====

Harkin introduced the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) into the Senate. Harkin delivered part of a speech in sign language so his deaf brother could understand.

Harkin has taken issue with the Supreme Court&#x27;s handling of a number of cases related to ADA, concerned that the judgments severely limited the scope of the legislation&#x27;s effectiveness:

&quot;Together, these cases, as handled by the nation&#x27;s highest court, have created a supreme absurdity: The more successful a person is at coping with a disability, the more likely it is for a court to find that he or she is no longer sufficiently disabled to be protected by the ADA. If that is the ruling, then these individuals may find that their requests for reasonable accommodations at work can be denied. Or that they can be fired—without recourse.&quot;

In order to address these issues Harkin proposed the ADA Amendments Act, which in his words &quot;will restore the proper balance and application of the ADA by clarifying and broadening the definition of disability, while increasing eligibility for ADA protections.&quot;

Harkin has also been a vocal critic of what he describes as the biased nature of the Medicaid program: &quot;The current Medicaid system is unacceptably biased in favor of institutional care. Two-thirds of Medicaid long-term care dollars are spent on institutional services, with only one-third going to community-based care. It&#x27;s time to rebalance the system.&quot;

During his political career, Harkin has generally supported the Supreme Court ruling &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which decided that a right to privacy under the due process clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution extends to a woman&#x27;s decision to have an abortion. He has opposed most efforts to place legal restrictions on &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, including voting against a ban on late-term abortion, while supporting contraception and education to reduce teen pregnancy. , Harkin received a 100 percent rating from NARAL, the pro-choice advocacy organization. He was very critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act.

Harkin has come out in favor of embryonic stem cell research. In July 2006, Harkin made a speech from the Senate floor in response to George W. Bush&#x27;s veto of the embryonic stem cell research federal funding bill.

In May 2009, Harkin announced he opposed any effort to overturn an Iowa Supreme Court decision in April 2009 that legalized same-sex marriage in Iowa. &quot;We all grow as we get older; we learn things, we become more sensitive to people and people&#x27;s lives,&quot; said Harkin. &quot;The more I&#x27;ve looked at that, I&#x27;ve grown to think differently about how we should live. I guess I&#x27;ve got to the point of live and let live.&quot;

On December 18, 2010, Harkin voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.

In September 2014, Harkin was one of 69 members of the US House and Senate to sign a letter to then-FDA commissioner Sylvia Burwell requesting that the FDA revise its policy banning donation of corneas and other tissues by men who have had sex with another man in the preceding 5 years.

Harkin has also been active in combating the worst forms of child labor. The Trade Development Act of 2000 &quot;contains important child labor protections authored by Senator Harkin.&quot; After reports of child trafficking and child slavery associated with cocoa plantations in West Africa surfaced in the media, Harkin, along with U.S. Representative Eliot Engel and with the support of U.S. Senator Herbert Kohl, sponsored a voluntary agreement by major players in the cocoa and chocolate industry signed in 2001 and often referred to as the Harkin–Engel Protocol. The purpose of this &quot;Protocol for the growing and processing of cocoa beans and their derivative products&quot; was to bring practices in West Africa into line with Convention 182 of the International Labour Organization concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labor. (Some difficulties in meeting the deadlines set in this Protocol have been encountered.) Harkin has worked in other ways to combat the import of child labor-made products.
Harkin believes America faces a retirement crisis, saying &quot;Pensions have gone by the wayside. Savings are down as people are just scraping by, so the only thing left is Social Security.&quot;

Harkin supported President Barack Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and he voted for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. PolitiFact rated Harkin&#x27;s 2009 claim regarding the number of Americans losing health insurance coverage &quot;false.&quot;

However, in 2014 Harkin expressed some second thoughts. He criticized health reform as being too complex and convoluted. &quot;All the prevention stuff is good but it&#x27;s just really complicated. It doesn&#x27;t have to be that complicated,&quot; he said of the Affordable Care Act. He also believes the new legislation rewards the insurance industry. He said important reforms such as preventing insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions and keeping young adults on their parents&#x27; health insurance plans until age 26 were laudable, but he believed that Democrats should not have settled for a solution he believed was inferior to government-provided health insurance. In retrospect he believes the Democratic-controlled Senate and House should have enacted a single-payer healthcare system or a public option to give the uninsured access to government-run health plans that compete with private insurance companies.

His comments about Cuban healthcare have been criticized as misrepresenting the availability of quality care.

====Israel====
Harkin has been a staunch supporter of Israel as a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, which appropriates about $2 billion annually for military financing for Israel. he was the third-largest career recipient of pro-Israel Political Action Committee contributions in the Senate.

====Immigration====
In May 2006 Harkin voted in favor of Senate Bill 2611, also known as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act. Among the bill&#x27;s many provisions, it would increase the number of H1B visas, increase security along the southern United States border with Mexico, allow long-time illegal immigrants to gain citizenship with some restrictions, and increase the number of guest workers over and above those already present in the U.S. through a new &quot;blue card&quot; visa program. The bill ultimately failed to pass.

==1992 presidential election==
===Primary campaign===
Harkin ran for President in 1992 as a populist with labor union support. He criticized George H. W. Bush for being out of touch with working-class Americans. Harkin was an early favorite in a small field of five candidates. Harkin won the Iowa caucus and those in Idaho and Minnesota (with help from Senator Paul Wellstone), but he ran poorly in New Hampshire and other primaries and ultimately lost the Democratic Party nomination to Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Harkin was the first Democratic primary contender to drop out and throw his support behind Clinton — a favor that led to a close relationship throughout the Clinton presidency.

;Endorsements
* Senator Paul Wellstone (D-Minnesota)
* Commissioner of Agriculture Jim Hightower (D-Texas)
* Representative Lane Evans (D-Illinois)

===Considered as running mate===
Harkin figured in running mate searches multiple times after his 1992 presidential campaign. Clinton considered Harkin in 1992 because of his ties to labor and strong support for Clinton after withdrawing from the presidential race. In 2000, Harkin was considered by Al Gore before Gore selected Joe Lieberman. In 2004, presidential nominee John Kerry considered Harkin as a running mate, though Harkin worked to promote the candidacy of then-Governor Tom Vilsack. In 2008, Barack Obama considered Harkin for vice president because of his senior statesman status within the party and his personal closeness to both Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Harkin endorsed Obama&#x27;s choice of Joe Biden for the nomination, and campaigned for the Obama-Biden ticket.

==Personal life==
On July 6, 1968, Harkin, then aged 28, married the former Ruth Raduenz, who was 23. The couple has two children: Amy (born 1976), and Jenny (born 1981). Ruth Harkin is an attorney and was one of the first women in the United States to be elected as a prosecutor when, in 1972, she was elected to the office of county attorney of Story County, Iowa. She served as a deputy counsel for the U.S. Department of Agriculture before joining the Washington law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld in 1983. In 1993, President Bill Clinton named her chairman and chief executive officer of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Ruth Harkin left the government and became United Technologies&#x27; senior vice president for international affairs and government relations in April 1997, leading their Washington DC office. In 2002, Mrs. Harkin became a director of ConocoPhillips. Mrs. Harkin sat on the Iowa Board of Regents, the body responsible for overseeing the state&#x27;s public universities.

Senator Harkin made a brief cameo appearance as himself in the political satire &quot;Dave&quot; (1993), as did his fellow senators Christopher Dodd, Howard Metzenbaum, Paul Simon and Alan K. Simpson.

The Harkins&#x27; daughter Amy appeared on the NBC daytime reality series &quot;Starting Over&quot; from 2003 to 2004, and his voice was heard in several episodes when his daughter spoke to him on the phone. She is a 2004 graduate of Princeton University, and received her master of business administration degree from the UCLA Anderson School of Management in 2007.

In 2015 New York City held its first Disability Pride Parade, and Tom Harkin was its grand marshal. He was also the grand marshal for the Chicago Disability Pride Parade that same year.

<doc id="375271" wikidata="Q679931" url="?curid=375271" title="Dialer">
<text>A dialer (American English) or dialler (British English) is an electronic device that is connected to a telephone line to monitor the dialed numbers and alter them to seamlessly provide services that otherwise require lengthy national or international access codes to be dialed. A dialer automatically inserts and modifies the numbers depending on the time of day, country or area code dialed, allowing the user to subscribe to the service providers who offer the best rates. For example, a dialer could be programmed to use one service provider for international calls and another for cellular calls. This process is known as prefix insertion or least cost routing. A line-powered dialer does not need any external power but instead takes the power it needs from the telephone line.

Another type of dialer is a computer program which creates a connection to the Internet or another computer network over the analog telephone or Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). Many operating systems already contain such a program for connections through the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP), such as WvDial.

Many internet service providers offer installation CDs to simplify the process of setting up a proper Internet connection. They either create an entry in the operating system&#x27;s dialer or install a separate dialer (as the AOL software does).

In recent years, the term &quot;dialer&quot; often refers specifically to dialers that connect without the user&#x27;s full knowledge as to cost, with the creator of the dialer intending to commit fraud.

== Auto-diallers ==

Call centres use various forms of automatic dialler to place outbound calls to people on contact lists.

== Fraudulent dialer ==
Dialers are necessary to connect to the internet (at least for non-broadband connections), but some dialers are designed to connect to premium-rate numbers. The providers of such dialers often search for security holes in the operating system installed on the user&#x27;s computer and use them to set the computer up to dial up through their number, so as to make money from the calls. Alternatively, some dialers inform the user what it is that they are doing, with the promise of special content, accessible only via the special number. Examples of this content include software for download, (usually illegal) trojans posing as MP3s, trojans posing as pornography, or &#x27;underground&#x27; programs such as cracks and keygens.

The cost of setting up such a service is relatively low, amounting to a few thousand dollars for telecommunications equipment, whereupon the unscrupulous operator will typically take 90% of the cost of a premium rate call, with very few overheads of their own.

Users with DSLs (or similar broadband connections) are usually not affected. A dialer can be downloaded and installed, but dialing in is not possible as there are no regular phone numbers in the DSL network and users will not typically have their dial-up modem, if any, connected to a phone line. However, if an ISDN adapter or additional analog modem is installed, the dialer might still be able to get a connection.

Malicious dialers can be identified by the following characteristics:
*A download popup opens when opening a website.
*On the website there is only a small hint, if any, about the price.
*The download starts even if the cancel button has been clicked.
*The dialer installs as default connection without any notice.
*The dialer creates unwanted connections by itself and without user interaction.
*The dialer does not show any notice about the price (only few do) before dialing in.
*The high price of the connection is not being shown while connected
*The dialer cannot be uninstalled, or only with serious effort.

=== Installation routes ===
Computers running Microsoft Windows without anti-virus software or proper updates could be vulnerable to Visual Basic-scripts which install a trojan horse which changes values in the Windows Registry and sets Internet Explorer security settings in a way that ActiveX controls can be downloaded from the Internet without warning. After this change is made, when a user accesses a malicious page or email message, it can start installing the dialer. The script also disables the modem speaker and messages that normally come up while dialing into a network. Users of Microsoft Office Outlook, Outlook Express and Internet Explorer are especially affected if running ActiveX controls and JavaScript is allowed and the latest security patches from Microsoft have not been installed. In March 2004, there were malicious dialers that could be installed through fake anti-virus software. E-mail spam from a so-called &quot;AntiVirus Team&quot; for example, contained download links to programs named &quot;downloadtool.exe&quot; or &quot;antivirus.exe&quot;, which are malicious dialers. Other ways of transmission include electronic greeting cards that link to pages that tricks the user to install ActiveX controls, which in turn install dialers in the background.

Therefore, links in spam emails should never be opened, automatically started downloads should be canceled as soon as discovered, and one should check on each dial-up to the Internet to see whether the displayed phone number is unchanged. Another way to protect oneself is to disable premium numbers through one&#x27;s phone services, but of course this disables all such services.

One should never run foreign code in a privileged environment unless the source is trustworthy. It is also advisable to protect oneself with anti-malware programs.

== German regulatory law ==

On 15 August 2003, a new law came into effect in Germany called &quot;Gesetz zur Bekämpfung des Missbrauchs von (0)190er/(0)900er Mehrwertdiensterufnummern&quot; (&quot;Law for the combat of misuse of (0)190/(0)900 value added service numbers&quot;).

The law contains the following regulations:
*Forced price notices for service providers.
*Maximum price limits, legitimacy checks and automatic disconnects.
*Registration of dialers.
*Blocking of dialers.
*Right of information for consumers from the RegTP.

On 4 March 2004 the German Federal Supreme Court in Karlsruhe decided that fees for the usage of dialers do not have to be paid if it was used without the user&#x27;s knowledge.

<text>Colorimetry is &quot;the science and technology used to quantify and describe physically the human color perception&quot;.
It is similar to spectrophotometry, but is distinguished by its interest in reducing spectra to the physical correlates of color perception, most often the CIE 1931 XYZ color space tristimulus values and related quantities.

==History==
The Duboscq colorimeter was invented by Jules Duboscq in 1870.
== Instruments ==
Colorimetric equipment is similar to that used in spectrophotometry. Some related equipment is also mentioned for completeness.

* A tristimulus colorimeter measures the tristimulus values of a color.
* A spectroradiometer measures the absolute spectral radiance (intensity) or irradiance of a light source.
* A spectrophotometer measures the spectral reflectance, transmittance, or relative irradiance of a color sample.
* A &quot;spectrocolorimeter&quot; is a spectrophotometer that can &quot;calculate&quot; tristimulus values.
* A densitometer measures the degree of light passing through or reflected by a subject.
* A &quot;color temperature meter&quot; measures the color temperature of an incident illuminant.

=== Tristimulus colorimeter ===

In digital imaging, colorimeters are tristimulus devices used for color calibration. Accurate color profiles ensure consistency throughout the imaging workflow, from acquisition to output.

=== Spectroradiometer, spectrophotometer, spectrocolorimeter ===
The absolute spectral power distribution of a light source can be measured with a &quot;spectroradiometer&quot;, which works by optically collecting the light, then passing it through a monochromator before reading it in narrow bands of wavelength.

Reflected color can be measured using a &quot;spectrophotometer&quot; (also called &quot;spectroreflectometer&quot; or &quot;reflectometer&quot;), which takes measurements in the visible region (and a little beyond) of a given color sample. If the custom of taking readings at 10 nanometer increments is followed, the visible light range of 400–700 nm will yield 31 readings. These readings are typically used to draw the sample&#x27;s spectral reflectance curve (how much it reflects, as a function of wavelength)—the most accurate data that can be provided regarding its characteristics.
The readings by themselves are typically not as useful as their tristimulus values, which can be converted into chromaticity co-ordinates and manipulated through color space transformations. For this purpose, a &quot;spectrocolorimeter&quot; may be used. A spectrocolorimeter is simply a spectrophotometer that can estimate tristimulus values by numerical integration (of the color matching functions&#x27; inner product with the illuminant&#x27;s spectral power distribution). One benefit of spectrocolorimeters over tristimulus colorimeters is that they do not have optical filters, which are subject to manufacturing variance, and have a fixed spectral transmittance curve—until they age. On the other hand, tristimulus colorimeters are purpose-built, cheaper, and easier to use.

The CIE (International Commission on Illumination) recommends using measurement intervals under 5 nm, even for smooth spectra. Sparser measurements fail to accurately characterize spiky emission spectra, such as that of the red phosphor of a CRT display, depicted aside.

=== Color temperature meter ===
Photographers and cinematographers use information provided by these meters to decide what color balancing should be done to make different light sources appear to have the same color temperature. If the user enters the reference color temperature, the meter can calculate the mired difference between the measurement and the reference, enabling the user to choose a corrective color gel or photographic filter with the closest mired factor.
Internally the meter is typically a silicon photodiode tristimulus colorimeter. The correlated color temperature can be calculated from the tristimulus values by first calculating the chromaticity co-ordinates in the CIE 1960 color space, then finding the closest point on the Planckian locus.

It ranges in elevation from and includes Mount Everest. In the north, it shares the international border with Qomolangma National Nature Preserve in Tibet Autonomous Region. In the east, it is adjacent to Makalu Barun National Park, and in the south it extends to Dudh Kosi river. It is part of the Sacred Himalayan Landscape.

==History==

Sagarmatha National Park was established on July 19, 1976. In 1979, it became the country&#x27;s first national park that was inscribed as a Natural World Heritage Site. In January 2002, a Buffer Zone comprising was added. Conservation of forests, wildlife, and cultural resources received top priority under the &quot;Buffer Zone Management Guidelines&quot;, followed by conservation of other natural resources and development of alternative energy. Tourism in the area began in the early 1960s. In 2003, about 19,000 tourists arrived. As of 2005, about 3,500 Sherpa people lived in villages and seasonal settlements situated along the main tourist trails.

==Landscape==
Sagarmatha National Park contains the upper catchment areas of the Dudh Kosi and Bhotekoshi rivers and the Gokyo Lakes. It ranges in elevation from at Monjo to the top of Mount Everest at . Other peaks above are Lhotse, Cho Oyu, Thamserku, Nuptse, Amadablam and Pumori. Barren land above comprises 69% of the park while 28% is grazing land and the remaining 3% is forested. Climatic zones span from temperate and subalpine above to alpine above , which is the upper limit of vegetation growth. The nival zone begins at .

<text>Kabah (also spelled Kabaah, Kabáh, Kahbah and Kaba) is a Maya archaeological site in the Puuc region of western Yucatan, south of Mérida. It was incorporated together with Uxmal, Sayil and Labna as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.

Kabah is south of Uxmal, connected to that site by an long raised causeway wide with monumental arches at each end. Kabah is the second largest ruin of the Puuc region after Uxmal. 

The site is on Fed. 261, approximately south from Mérida, Yucatán, towards Campeche, Campeche, and is a popular tourism destination. Ruins extend for a considerable distance on both sides of the highway; many of the more distant structures are little visited, and some are still overgrown with forest. , a program was ongoing to clear and restore more buildings, as well as archeological excavations under the direction of archeologist Ramón Carrasco.

Kabah was declared a Yucatán state park in 1993.

==History==
The name &quot;Kabah&quot; or &quot;Kabaah&quot; was first suggested by Estanislao Carrillo in 1846 and is usually taken to be archaic Maya language for &quot;strong hand&quot;. This is a pre-Columbian name for the site, mentioned in the &quot;Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel&quot;. An alternative name is &quot;Kabahaucan&quot; or &quot;royal snake in the hand,&quot; suggested by Teoberto Maler.

The area was inhabited from the mid-3rd century BCE. Most of the architecture now visible was built between the 7th century and 11th centuries CE. J. E. S. Thompson used a sculpted doorjamb from Structure 2C6 to suggest the date of the ruin to be 879 CE, probably around the city&#x27;s apex. Another inscribed date found at the site is one of the latest carved in the Maya Classic style, in 987 CE.

==Archaeological site==

The most famous structure at Kabah is the &quot;Palace of the Masks&quot;, the façade decorated with hundreds of stone masks of the long-nosed rain god Chaac; it is also known as the &quot;Codz Poop&quot;, meaning &quot;Rolled Matting&quot;, from the pattern of the stone mosaics. This massive repetition of a single set of elements is unusual in Maya art, and here is used to unique effect.

Masks of the rain god abound on other structures throughout the site. Copal incense has been discovered in some of the stone noses of the raingods. The emphasis placed on &quot;Chaac&quot;, the Protector of the Harvest, both here and at other neighboring Puuc sites, stemmed from the scarcity of water in the region. There are no &quot;cenotes&quot; in this dryer, northern part of the Yucatán, so the Maya here had to depend solely on rain.

The site also has a number of other palaces, low stone buildings, and step pyramid temples. While most are in the Puuc Maya style, some show &quot;Chenes&quot; elements. The site had a number of sculpted panels, lintels, and doorjambs, most of which have been removed to museums elsewhere. The sculptures mostly depict the site&#x27;s rulers and scenes of warfare.

The first detailed account of the ruin was published by John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood in 1843.

===Northwest Group===

The Northwest group consists of structures 1A1 and 1A2, a hilltop group with several smaller ancillary structures resting on the crest of the ridge at the western edge of the site. The group looks over the city to the east and directly faces the principal pyramid temple (Structure 1B2).

===West Group===

The West Group consists of Structures 1A7 and 1A8 as well as the Court of Structures 2A1, consisting of Structures 2A1, 2A2, and 2A3.

===East or Palace Group===
The East Group consists of Structures 2B1-3, Structures 2C1, 4, and 5, and Structures 2C2, 2C3, 2C6 (&quot;Codz Poop&quot;), and 2C7. This is the largest and presumably most important group of structures at Kabah. These buildings are also the best preserved. The primary orientation of the assemblage is toward the west, looking over the central part of the city, and at the Northwest and West Groups on the western ridge with its main approach being from the west.

===Various Other Groups===
There are many other groups that exist outside of the central core area. These groups include Structures 1A3-6, Structures 1B2, 1B3, and 1C1-3, and lastly, Structure 3B1.

===Miscellaneous Sculptures and Monuments===

The miscellaneous sculptures include M1 through M7 which are various pieces of what were once statues that seem to depict people, possibly deities or rulers. M1 is perhaps the most noteworthy, being the sculpture often referenced by the archaeologists who named the site as it appears to be a clenched hand which led to the name “Kabah”. The site also has a number of altars, low stone buildings, and step pyramid temples. While most of the architecture and sculptures are in the Puuc Maya style, some show Chenes elements. The site had a number of sculpted panels, lintels, and doorjambs, most of which have been removed to museums elsewhere. Kabah boasts more large monumental structures than any other site in the Puuc region.

==Research==

In 1955, Karl Ruppert and A. Ledyard Smith lead a research expedition of sites within a 20-km radius of the ruins of Mayapan in order to compare the house types of those sites with those of Mayapan and to find the extent of the Mayapan type. Kabah was one of a few other sites surveyed in order to obtain data on their house types. All structures investigated in Kabah were either of the single-room type, with a doorway in one wall, or were a series of adjoining single rooms each with its separate doorway. Many well-cut reused stones were seen in the walls, which now stand about high. Some houses were situated on terraces supporting a ceremonial group; others were apart from ceremonial buildings. They occurred in groups of two, three, and four, as well as singly, sometimes on raised areas. Two architectural groups were located close to &quot;chultuns&quot;.

Microbial biofilms have been found degrading stone buildings at Uxmal and Kabah. Phototrophs such as &quot;Xenococcus&quot; are found more often on interior walls. However stone degrading &quot;Gloeocapsa&quot; and &quot;Synechocystis&quot; were also present in large numbers.

<text>Patriots&#x27; Day (Patriot&#x27;s Day in Maine) is an annual event, formalized as a legal holiday or a special observance day in six U.S. states, commemorating the battles of Lexington, Concord, and Menotomy, the inaugural battles of the American Revolutionary War. The holiday occurs on the third Monday of April each year, with celebrations including battle reenactments and the Boston Marathon.

==History==
In 1894, the Lexington Historical Society petitioned the Massachusetts General Court to proclaim April 19 as &quot;Lexington Day&quot;. Concord countered with &quot;Concord Day&quot;. However, the biggest battle fought on this day was in the town of Menotomy—now Arlington, Massachusetts—on the Concord Road between Lexington and Boston. So Governor Frederic T. Greenhalge opted for a compromise: Patriots&#x27; Day. 
Governor Greenhalge proclaimed Patriots&#x27; Day in Massachusetts in 1894, replacing Fast Day as a public holiday. It was established on April 19, commemorating the date of the Battles of Lexington and Concord and the larger Battle of Menotomy in 1775, and consolidating the longstanding municipal observances of Lexington Day and Concord Day. It also marked the first bloodshed of the American Civil War in the Baltimore riot of 1861. The dual commemoration, Greenhalge explained, celebrated &quot;the anniversary of the birth of liberty and union&quot;. It is likely that the battles that took place in Menotomy are not as well known as the smaller battles in Lexington and Concord because the town has had several names since that day in 1775. In 1938, the Massachusetts legislature passed a bill establishing the holiday &quot;in commemoration of the opening events of the War of the Revolution&quot;.

Maine followed Massachusetts in 1907 and replaced its Fast Day with Patriot&#x27;s Day.
On June 10, 2017, Governor Dannel Malloy signed a bill establishing Patriots&#x27; Day as a statewide unpaid holiday in Connecticut, and Connecticut became the fifth state to recognize the holiday on April 16, 2018. On March 19, 2019, Governor Doug Burgum signed a bill recognizing Patriots&#x27; Day in the state of North Dakota.

==Description==
The holiday was originally celebrated on April 19, the actual anniversary of the battles (fought in 1775). Since 1969, it has been observed on the third Monday in April in Massachusetts and in Maine (which until the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was part of Massachusetts). The Monday holiday creates a three-day long weekend. It is also the first day of a vacation week for public schools in both states and a school holiday for many local colleges and universities, both public and private.

The day is a public school observance day in Wisconsin. Florida law also encourages people to celebrate it, though it is not treated as a legal holiday. Connecticut began observance in 2018 and North Dakota in 2019.

Observances and re-enactments of the battles occur annually at Lexington Green in Lexington, Massachusetts (around 6:00 am) and the Old North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts (around 9:00 am) and in Arlington, Massachusetts on the Sunday before Patriot&#x27;s Day. Tours are available of the Jason Russell House in Arlington, Massachusetts on Sunday and Monday. On Monday morning, mounted re-enactors with state police escorts retrace the Midnight Rides of Paul Revere and William Dawes, calling out warnings the whole way.

The most significant celebration of Patriots&#x27; Day is the Boston Marathon, which has been run every Patriots&#x27; Day since April 19, 1897 (except in 2020 and 2021) to mark the then-recently established holiday, with the race linking the Athenian and American struggles for liberty.

==Sporting events==
The Boston Marathon has been run on Patriots&#x27; Day every year since its inception in 1897, even during the World War years, except in 2020 and 2021. Therefore, sometimes the holiday is referred to as &quot;Marathon Monday&quot;. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Boston Marathon was canceled, and the 2021 Boston Marathon was rescheduled to October 11.

The Boston Red Sox have been scheduled to play at home in Fenway Park on Patriots&#x27; Day every year since 1959. The game was postponed due to weather in 1959, 1961, 1965, 1967, 1984, and 2018. It was canceled in 1995 due to the baseball strike, and again in 2020 due to COVID-19. The game was played in 2013 despite the Boston Marathon bombing because it had finished before the bombs went off. From 1968 to 2006 the games started early, in the morning, around 11:00 am. The early start to these games usually resulted in the games&#x27; ending just as the runners headed through Kenmore Square. However, since 2007 the marathon has started between 9:30 am and 10:00 am, causing the racers to pass through Kenmore closer to the middle of the Red Sox game.

<doc id="375286" wikidata="Q1707800" url="?curid=375286" title="Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell">
<text>Frederick Edward Robin Butler, Baron Butler of Brockwell (born 3 January 1938) is a retired British civil servant, now sitting in the House of Lords as a crossbencher.

==Early life and family==
Butler was born in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, on 3 January 1938. He went to Orley Farm School and Harrow School (where he was Head Boy), then taught for a year at St Dunstan&#x27;s School, Burnham-on-Sea, before attending University College, Oxford, where he took a double first in Mods and Greats and twice gained a Rugby Blue. He married Gillian Lois Galley in 1962. They have two daughters and a son.

==Civil service career==
Butler had a high-profile career in the civil service from 1961 to 1998, serving as Private Secretary to five Prime Ministers. He was Secretary of the Cabinet and Head of the Home Civil Service from 1988 to 1998.

He joined HM Treasury in 1961, becoming Private Secretary to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury 1964–66 and Secretary to the Budget Committee 1965–69.

Early in his career, he was occasionally confused with his namesake Rab Butler. Memos for Rab Butler, some highly sensitive, ended up on his desk, and some of his ended up on Rab&#x27;s. It was agreed that all memos ambiguously addressed to &quot;R Butler&quot; should go to Rab&#x27;s office first, and then Rab&#x27;s office would send on any intended for the other R Butler. It is said that one day the young Butler, who was still playing first class rugby, received a letter that read: &quot;You have been selected for the Richmond 1st XV on Saturday. Please be at Twickenham by 2 p.m.&quot;. Underneath, in Rab&#x27;s distinctive handwriting, was the message: &quot;Dear Robin, I am not free on Saturday. Please could you deputise for me? Rab&quot;!

In 1969, he was seconded to the Bank of England and several City institutions. Later at HM Treasury as Assistant Secretary, General Expenditure Intelligence Division, he led the team which installed the UK Government&#x27;s computerised financial information system 1975–77. He had been a founder member of the Central Policy Review Staff under Lord Rothschild 1971–2. After several senior appointments at the Treasury, he became second Permanent Secretary, Public Expenditure, 1985–87.

He was Private Secretary to Prime Ministers Edward Heath (1972–74) and Harold Wilson (1974–75), and Principal Private Secretary to Margaret Thatcher (1982–85). Along with Thatcher, he was almost killed in the 1984 IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton. He was also Cabinet Secretary during the premierships of Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair.

==Other activities==

After retiring from the Civil Service, Butler was Master of University College, Oxford, 1998–2008. He was made a life peer in the 1998 New Year Honours and was raised to the peerage as Baron Butler of Brockwell, of Herne Hill in the London Borough of Lambeth.

He was a non-executive Director of HSBC Group from 1998 to 2008. He was also Chairman of the Corporate Sustainability Committee and the HSBC Global Education Trust. In 2011 he was elected Master of the Worshipful Company of Salters. He is a Trustee of the Royal Academy of Music. 

In 2004, Lord Butler chaired the Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction, widely known as the &#x27;Butler Review&#x27;, which reviewed the use of intelligence in the lead up to the 2003 Iraq War. The report concluded that some of the intelligence about Iraq&#x27;s possession of weapons of mass destruction was seriously flawed. The report also concluded, with regards to the so-called Niger uranium forgeries, that the report Saddam&#x27;s government was seeking uranium in Africa appeared &#x27;well-founded&#x27;.

<text>Operation Ivory Coast was a mission conducted by United States Special Operations Forces and other American military elements to rescue U.S. prisoners of war during the Vietnam War. It was also the first joint military operation in United States history conducted under the direct control of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The specially selected raiders extensively trained and rehearsed the operation at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, while planning and intelligence gathering continued from 25 May to 20 November 1970.

On 21 November 1970, a joint United States Air Force and United States Army force commanded by Air Force Brigadier General LeRoy J. Manor and Army Colonel Arthur D. &quot;Bull&quot; Simons landed 56 U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers by helicopter at the Sơn Tây prisoner-of-war camp, which was located west of Hanoi, North Vietnam. The objective of the operation was the recovery of 61 American prisoners of war thought to be held at the camp. It was found during the raid that the camp contained no prisoners as they had recently been moved to another camp.

Despite the absence of prisoners, the raid&#x27;s execution was nearly flawless, with only two casualties and two aircraft losses (one of the aircraft losses was due to a planned crash landing during the assault on the prisoner compound). Criticism of the failure to detect the removal of the POWs prior to the raid, both public and within the administration of Richard Nixon, led to a major reorganization of the United States intelligence community a year later.

== Planning, organization and training ==

=== Polar Circle ===
The concept of a rescue mission inside North Vietnam began on 9 May 1970. An Air Force intelligence unit concluded through analysis of aerial photography that a compound near Sơn Tây, suspected since late 1968 of being a prisoner of war camp, contained 55 American POWs and that at least six were in urgent need of rescue. 12,000 North Vietnamese troops were stationed within of the camp. After validation of their findings, Brigadier General (BG) James R. Allen, the deputy director for plans and policy at Headquarters USAF, met in the Pentagon on 25 May with Army BG Donald Blackburn, Special Assistant for Counterinsurgency and Special Activities (SACSA). Blackburn reported directly to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and had also been the first commander of the covert Studies and Observation Group in Vietnam.

Blackburn immediately met with General Earle G. Wheeler, the outgoing JCS Chairman, to recommend a rescue of all the POWs at Son Tây. To study the feasibility of a raid, Wheeler authorized a 15-member planning group under the codename &quot;Polar Circle&quot; that convened on June 10. One of its members was an officer who would actually participate in the raid as a rescue helicopter pilot. The study group, after a review of all available intelligence, concluded that Sơn Tây contained 61 POWs.

When Blackburn&#x27;s recommendation that he lead the mission himself was turned down, he asked Colonel Arthur D. Simons on 13 July to command the Army&#x27;s personnel. Eglin Air Force Base was selected as the joint training site for the prospective force. Personnel selection proceeded over the objections of the Marine Corps, which was excluded from participation, but selection and planning was performed by Special Operations &quot;operators&quot;, not by the JCS, to avoid service parochialism, resulting in a force chosen for mission needs, highlighting combat experience in Southeast Asia and operational specialty skills, and not rank or branch of service.

=== Ivory Coast ===
The second phase, Operation &quot;Ivory Coast&quot;, began on 8 August 1970, when Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, the new JCS Chairman, designated Manor as commander and Simons as deputy commander of the mission task force. &quot;Ivory Coast&quot; was the organization, planning, training, and deployment phase of the operation. Manor set up an Air Force training facility at Eglin&#x27;s Duke Field and brought together a 27-member planning staff that included 11 from the prior feasibility study.

Simons chose 103 personnel from interviews of 500 volunteers, most were Special Forces personnel of the 6th and 7th Special Forces Groups at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. USAF planners selected key Air Force commanders, who then picked personnel for their crews. Helicopter and A-1 Skyraider crews were put together from instructors at Eglin and personnel returned from Southeast Asia. Two crews for C-130E(I) Combat Talons were assembled from squadrons in West Germany and North Carolina. All were then asked to volunteer for a temporary duty assignment without additional pay and without being told the nature of the mission. 103 Army and 116 USAF personnel were selected for the project, including ground force members, aircrewmen, support members and planners. The 219-man task force planned, trained, and operated under the title of the &quot;Joint Contingency Task Group&quot; (JCTG).

The planning staff set up parameters for a nighttime raid, the key points of which were clear weather and a quarter moon at 35 degrees above the horizon for optimum visibility during low-level flight. From these parameters, two mission &quot;windows&quot; were identified, 18–25 October and 18–25 November. Training proceeded on Range C-2 at Eglin using an exact but crudely made replica of the prison compound for rehearsals and a $60,000 five-foot-by-five-foot scale table model (codenamed &quot;Barbara&quot;) for familiarization.
Air Force crews flew 1,054 hours in southern Alabama, Georgia, and Florida conducting &quot;dissimilar (aircraft) formation&quot; training with both UH-1H and HH-3E helicopters at night and at low-level (a flight profile for which procedures had to be innovated by the two selected crews), and gaining expertise in navigation training using forward looking infrared (FLIR), which, until &quot;Ivory Coast&quot;, had not been part of the Combat Talon&#x27;s electronics suite. A vee formation in which the slower helicopters drafted in echelon slightly above and behind each wing of the Combat Talon escort aircraft was chosen and refined for the mission to give the helicopters the speed necessary to keep pace with the Talons flying just above their stall speeds.

Special Forces training began on 9 September, advancing to night training on 17 September and joint training with air crews on 28 September that included six rehearsals a day, three of them under night conditions. By 6 October, 170 practice sessions of all or partial phases of the mission were performed on the mockup by the Special Forces troopers, many with live fire. On that date, the first full-scale dress rehearsal, using a UH-1H as the assault helicopter, was conducted at night and included a 5.5-hour, flight of all aircraft, replicating the timing, speeds, altitudes and turns in the mission plan. The rehearsal spelled the end of the option to use the UH-1 when its small passenger compartment resulted in leg cramps to the Special Forces troopers that completely disrupted the timing of their assault, more than offsetting the UH-1&#x27;s only advantage (smaller rotor radius) over the larger HH-3. Two further full night rehearsals and a total of 31 practice landings by the HH-3E in the mockup&#x27;s courtyard confirmed the choice.

On 24 September, Manor recommended approval of the October window to US Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, with 21 October as the primary execution date. However, at a White House briefing on 8 October with National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and General Alexander M. Haig, Kissinger delayed the mission to the November window because President Nixon was not in Washington and could not be briefed in time for approval of the October window. This delay, while posing a risk of compromising the secrecy of the mission, had the benefits of additional training, acquisition of night-vision equipment and further reconnaissance of the prison.

Manor and Simons met with the commander of Task Force 77, Vice Admiral Frederic A. Bardshar, aboard his flagship on 5 November to arrange for a diversionary mission to be flown by naval aircraft. Because of policy restrictions of the bombing halt then in place, the naval aircraft would not carry ordnance except for a few planes tasked for Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR).

Between 10 and 18 November, the JCTG moved to its staging base at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The Combat Talons, using the call signs Daw 43 and Thumb 66 in the guise of being a part of Project &quot;Heavy Chain&quot;, left Eglin on 10 November, flew to Norton Air Force Base, California, and then routed through Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii and Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, arriving in Takhli on 14 November. The next day, four C-141 Starlifters departed one per day (to avoid the appearance of a major operation in progress), carrying the Army contingent of the JCTG, its equipment and the UH-1 helicopter from Eglin to Thailand. The Special Forces personnel arrived in Thailand at 03:00 local time 18 November and later that date President Nixon approved execution of the mission, setting in motion the final phase, &quot;Operation Kingpin&quot;.

After overcoming in-theater friction with the 1st Weather Group at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, South Vietnam, planners began watching the weather during the week before the projected target date. On 18 November, Typhoon Patsy struck the Philippines and headed west towards Hanoi. Weather forecasts indicated that Patsy would cause bad weather over the Gulf of Tonkin on 21 November, preventing carrier support operations, and converging with a cold front coming out of southern China, would cause poor conditions over North Vietnam for the remainder of the window. The presence of the cold front, however, indicated that conditions in the objective area on 20 November would be good and possibly acceptable over Laos for navigation of the low-level penetration flights. A reconnaissance flight on the afternoon of 20 November by an RF-4C Phantom carrying a weather specialist confirmed the forecast. Manor decided to advance the mission date by 24 hours rather than delay it by five days.

Manor issued the formal launch order at 15:56 local time 20 November, while the raiding force was in the final stages of crew rest, and brought together the entire ground contingent for a short briefing regarding the objective and launch times. Following the briefing, Manor and his staff flew by T-39 Sabreliner to Da Nang Air Base, where they would monitor the mission from the USAF Tactical Air Control Center, North Sector (TACC/NS) at Monkey Mountain Facility. Three theater lift C-130s previously staged at U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield arrived at Takhli to transport the Army contingent and helicopter crews to Udorn RTAFB and the A-1 pilots to Nakhon Phanom.

== Mission organization ==

=== Special Forces ===

The fifty-six Special Forces troopers selected to conduct the raid were flown from Takhli to their helicopter staging base at Udorn RTAFB by C-130 on the evening of 20 November. The Special Forces were organized into three platoons: a 14-man assault group, codenamed &quot;Blueboy&quot;, which would crash-land within the prison compound; a 22-man support group, &quot;Greenleaf&quot;, which would provide immediate support for the assault team and a 20-man security group, &quot;Redwine&quot;, to protect the prison area from People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) reaction forces and provide backup support if needed for either of the other two groups. Simons (using the call sign &quot;Axle&quot;) accompanied the &quot;Greenleaf&quot; group, while the ground force commander, LTC Elliott P. &quot;Bud&quot; Sydnor Jr. (&quot;Wildroot&quot;), was with the &quot;Redwine&quot; group.

The 56 raiders were heavily armed, carrying a total of 51 personal sidearms, 48 CAR-15 carbines, two M16 rifles, four M79 grenade launchers, two shotguns and four M60 machine guns. They carried 15 Claymore mines, 11 demolition charges and 213 hand grenades and were equipped with a plethora of wire cutters, bolt cutters, axes, chainsaws, crowbars, ropes, bullhorns, lights and other equipment (much of it acquired from commercial retail sources) to execute the mission. The ground force was also equipped for voice communications with 58 UHF-AM and 34 VHF-FM radios, including a survival radio for each individual soldier.

=== Aviation support ===
116 aircraft (59 Navy and 57 USAF) participated in the operation, with 28 aircraft (crewed by 92 airmen) assigned direct roles in the target area. Two C-130E(I) Combat Talons, modified with the temporary addition of FLIR sets, were assigned to navigate the mission. One was to lead the helicopter &quot;assault formation&quot; (Cherry 01) and the second to escort the A-1 &quot;strike formation&quot; (Cherry 02). Because of the variances in cruising speeds between the helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, the forces flew separate routes, with the faster strike formation trailing the helicopter formation by several minutes and zig-zagging across its route. Each Combat Talon crew cross-trained to assume the role of the other, but the assault formation was required to have a navigation leader with four fully functioning engines all the way to the objective.

The 28 aircraft with direct roles were:

== Execution of Operation Kingpin ==

=== Penetration into North Vietnam ===
Beginning at 22:00 20 November 1970, aircraft began leaving five bases in Thailand and one in South Vietnam. Cherry 02, the Combat Talon escort for the A-1 strike formation, took off from Takhli at 22:25. Cherry 01, scheduled to take off a half hour later, had difficulty starting an engine and took off 23 minutes late at 23:18. Cherry 01 adjusted its flight plan and made up the time lost at engine start. At 23:07, two HC-130P aerial refuelers (call signs Lime 01 and Lime 02) took off from Udorn, followed by the helicopters ten minutes later. Shortly after midnight, the A-1 Skyraiders lifted off four minutes early from Nakhon Phanom RTAFB under blacked-out conditions. The helicopters encountered thick clouds over northern Laos at their refueling altitude and climbed to AGL (Above Ground Level) to refuel from Lime 01 on the flight plan&#x27;s fourth leg. Lime 01 then led them to the next checkpoint for hand-off to Cherry 01 at 01:16.

The formations flew roughly parallel tracks that crossed Laos to the west of the Plain of Jars before turning northeastward. Both formations flew twelve planned legs. The flight path was a corridor wide, the width required for safe terrain clearance in the event of formation breakup or the loss of drafting position by a helicopter. The Combat Talon navigators had the task of keeping the formations on the center line of the corridor. Pilots of both formations required a flight path of descending legs, maintaining an altitude of above ground level in the mountain valleys, because the HH-3E had difficulties in climbing while in formation. The Combat Talon C-130s experienced sluggish flight controls at the required airspeeds and the A-1s were hampered by their heavy ordnance loads.

The slow speeds necessary for the formations, for the helicopters and for the A-1s, degraded nearly all modes of the Combat Talon&#x27;s AN/APQ-115 TF/TA navigational radars. The Terrain Following mode computed changes in altitude only to a programmed minimum airspeed of , well outside the parameters of the mission. The Terrain Avoidance mode (adapted from the AN/APQ-99 terrain avoidance radar of the RF-4C photo reconnaissance aircraft) was distorted by the nose-high attitude dictated by the slow speeds and would no longer display hazardous terrain directly in front of or below the Combat Talon&#x27;s flight path. The Doppler radar (used to calculate wind drift and ground speed) often had to use information in its computer&#x27;s memory because of processing lapses. While the ground-mapping radar (correlating landmarks shown on maps to radar returns) was not affected, the jungle terrain did not provide easily identifiable points. All of these handicaps were overcome with the external pod installation of FLIR, which readily identified the rivers and lakes used as turning points.
The assault formation approached from the southwest using the clutter returns of the mountains to mask them from radar detection, while U.S. Navy aircraft launched at 01:00 21 November from the aircraft carriers and &quot;Ranger&quot; in the largest carrier night operation of the Vietnam War. Starting at 01:52, 20 A-7 Corsairs and A-6 Intruders, flying in pairs at stepped-up altitudes to deconflict their flight paths, entered North Vietnamese airspace on three tracks, dropping flares to simulate an attack. The last track also dropped chaff to mimic the mining of Haiphong harbor. Over the Gulf of Tonkin, 24 other aircraft in 13 orbits provided support and protection. The operation prompted a frantic air defense reaction at 02:17 that provided a highly effective diversion for the raiders and completely saturated the North Vietnamese air defense system.

Both USAF formations, over a period of thirteen minutes, were unavoidably but separately exposed for several minutes each to an early warning radar located at Na San, North Vietnam, to the north, because the flight tracks had to be routed around uncharted mountains. Neither formation was detected, possibly because of the diversion. The rescue forces entered the Red River valley at AGL to find conditions clear and visibility excellent. The helicopter formation reached its Initial Point (20 kilometers—12 minutes flying time—from Son Tây) with the A-1 strike formation two minutes behind, as planned. The HH-3E assault team helicopter had flown formation just behind and above the left wingtip of Cherry 01, drafting on the leader to gain the additional airspeed needed to bring its cruise airspeed safely above the stalling speed of the Combat Talon. Cherry 01 and the two HH-53s designated for prisoner pickup accelerated to climb to AGL, while the four assault helicopters broke formation and descended to in single file, timed to land forty-five seconds apart.

=== Combat assault ===
At 02:18 Cherry 01 transmitted the execute command &quot;Alpha, Alpha, Alpha&quot; to all aircraft as it overflew the prison and deployed four illumination flares, then performed a hard-turning descent to to drop two battle simulators south and southeast of Sơn Tây. After Apple 03 made its strafing pass with side-firing miniguns on the prison&#x27;s guard towers, Cherry 01 successfully dropped one of two planned napalm ground markers as a point of reference for the A-1s, then departed the objective area to a holding point over Laos where it would provide UHF direction-finding steers for the departing aircraft.

The assault helicopters in single file encountered winds that caused them to break formation to the right of their intended track. The pilots of Apple 03, the gunship helicopter preceding the others, observed a compound nearly identical to the prison camp in size and layout (previously labeled a &quot;secondary school&quot; by intelligence sources) and steered toward it, followed by the assault lift force. However, they recognized their error when they saw the river next to the actual location and corrected their flight path. Banana, the HH-3E carrying the &quot;Blueboy&quot; assault team, descended on the wrong location and observed that the expected courtyard was much smaller than required and that the expected treeline enclosed the compound rather than crossing through it. By that time, &quot;Blueboy&quot; (as previously rehearsed) was firing its weapons from all openings in the helicopter. Banana&#x27;s pilots also recognized the error, applied power and quickly veered north to the actual target.

Despite the error and trees taller than briefed that forced a steeper descent than rehearsed, the assault team crash-landed into the courtyard of Sơn Tây prison at 02:19 with all weapons firing. Although one raider, acting as a door gunner, was thrown from the aircraft, the only casualty was the helicopter&#x27;s flight engineer, whose ankle was fractured by a dislodged fire extinguisher. Army Captain Richard J. Meadows used a bullhorn to announce their presence to the expected POWs, while the team dispersed in four elements on a rapid and violent assault of the prison, killing guards and methodically searching the five prisoner blocks cell by cell.

Also at 02:19, Apple 01 (after its pilots saw Banana fire on the first location) landed the &quot;Greenleaf&quot; support group outside the south side of the secondary school, thinking it to be the target prison compound. Unaware that it was 400 meters from the objective, it lifted off to relocate to its holding area. The &quot;secondary school&quot; was actually a barracks for troops that, alerted by Banana&#x27;s aborted assault, opened fire on &quot;Greenleaf&quot; as two of its elements assaulted the compound. The support group attacked the location with small arms and hand grenades in an eight-minute firefight, after which Simons estimated that 100 to 200 hostile soldiers had been killed. Two A-1s supported &quot;Greenleaf&quot; with an air strike using white phosphorus bombs on a wooden footbridge east of the area. Apple 01 returned at 02:23, and by 02:28, the support group had disengaged under fire and reboarded the helicopter for the short movement to the correct landing area.

The pilot of Apple 02 observed the errors in navigation by the helicopters in front of him and made a hard turn towards the prison. He also observed Apple 01 unload at the secondary school and initiated Plan Green, the contingency plan for the loss or absence of &quot;Greenleaf&quot;. The &quot;Redwine&quot; security group, including ground force commander Sydnor, landed at 02:20 outside Sơn Tây prison and immediately executed the previously rehearsed contingency plan. In the meantime, Cherry 02 arrived with the A-1 force, dropped two more napalm ground markers, and created other diversions to disguise the target area by dropping MK-6 log flares and battle simulators at road intersections that North Vietnamese reaction forces might be expected to use. Cherry 02 then orbited in the area just west of the Black River acting as on-call support for the ground teams, jamming North Vietnamese radio communications, and providing a secure radio link to the mission command post in Da Nang.

After a thorough search that included a second sweep ordered by Meadows, &quot;Blueboy&quot;&#x27;s three teams found that the prison held no POWs. Meadows transmitted the code phrase &quot;Negative Items&quot; to the command group. Pathfinders clearing the extraction landing zone blew up an electrical tower that blacked out the entire west side of Sơn Tây including the prison area. At 02:29, Sydnor ordered the A-1s to attack the vehicle bridge over the Song Con leading into the area and, three minutes later, called for extraction by the HH-53s idling on the ground in a holding area a mile away. Before the first helicopter arrived, a truck convoy approached the prison from the south, but was stopped by two &quot;Redwine&quot; security teams that each fired an M72 light antitank weapon into the lead vehicle.

At 02:28, Cherry 02&#x27;s electronic warfare operator noted that Fan Song fire control radars for North Vietnamese SA-2 SAM sites had gone active. SAM launches at the F-105 Wild Weasel force began at 02:35, with at least 36 missiles fired at the rescue forces. One F-105 was briefly enveloped in burning fuel by a near-miss at 02:40 and returned to base. Its replacement was severely damaged six minutes later by another SAM. Twenty other SAMs fired at Navy aircraft all missed. Two MiG-21 interceptors on alert duty at Phúc Yên Air Base were never given permission to launch, despite several requests to do so.

=== Extraction of the raiders ===
The HH-53s returned singly to the extraction landing zone amidst the SAM barrage, flying well below the minimum effective level of the missiles, and Apple 01 landed first at 02:37. It lifted off with its passengers at 02:40, followed a minute later by the landing of Apple 02, which departed at 02:45. Apple 03, the last aircraft out, was cleared to leave its holding area at 02:48. The raid had been executed in only 27 minutes, well within the planned 30-minute optimum time. Although at first it was feared one raider had been left behind, all the troopers were accounted for. One &quot;Redwine&quot; trooper had been wounded in the leg and was the only casualty to hostile fire on the raid.

Shortly after its departure, Apple 03 mistook a support fighter for a MiG and called a warning, and although one of the Combat Apple KC-135s supporting the mission issued information that no MiGs had taken off, the entire force descended to treetop altitude. Apple 04 reported that an air-to-air missile had been launched at it and missed, but this was later found to have been aerial rockets fired into a hillside by one of the A-1 escorts, jettisoning ordnance to increase maneuverability as a result of the erroneous MiG call.

The assault formation was out of North Vietnam by 03:15 and landed back at Udorn at 04:28, five hours after launch. The crew of the damaged F-105 was compelled to eject over northern Laos, thirty minutes after being hit and within sight of its tanker, when its engine flamed out from lack of fuel. Alleycat, the C-130E Airborne Control and Command (ABCCC) aircraft in orbit at the time over northern Laos, coordinated with several USAF entities, including Brigham Control in Thailand and ground resources in Laos, to cover the downed crewmen with supporting aircraft until a search and rescue effort could be mounted. Lime 01, refueling at Udorn, took off again using the call sign King 21 to coordinate the recovery, while Lime 02 refueled Apple 04 and Apple 05 to extend their flight time. Supported by the C-123 Candlestick flare aircraft diverted from its station on another mission by Alleycat, a SAR force was launched, and when its A-1s arrived from Nakhon Phanom to cover the pickups, Apple 04 and Apple 05 each recovered one of the downed airmen at first light after three hours on the ground.
== Aftermath ==

=== Intelligence controversy ===
While the mission was deemed a &quot;tactical success&quot; because of its execution and the message it conveyed, critics proclaimed it an &quot;intelligence failure&quot;. The 65 prisoners at Sơn Tây had been moved on 14 July because its wells had become unusable possibly due to contamination by flooding, to a camp closer to Hanoi that the POWs dubbed &quot;Camp Faith&quot;. The existence of &quot;Camp Faith&quot; (Dong Hoi) was only revealed to US intelligence on Thursday November 19th, 1970, in a coded message from Nguyen Van Hoang, an intelligence source in North Vietnam. Although relatively near Sơn Tây, the risk of disastrous consequences from lack of reconnaissance, planning and rehearsing precluded a switch of targets at the last minute. A mission with Camp Faith as the objective required a lengthy delay for a new window of acceptable conditions, which increased the chance of security compromise and further withheld personnel and equipment from their parent commands. New reports of increasing numbers of deaths among POWs argued strongly against such a delay. The raid went as planned in the event that the renewed activity at Sơn Tây noted in aerial reconnaissance photos taken 13 November involved POWs.

Despite the mission&#x27;s intelligence shortcomings, the gathering of accurate intelligence for the operation, in both quality and quantity, was remarkably successful. The shortcomings lay in &quot;compartmentalization&quot; of the information and isolation of the JTCG from &quot;the normal intelligence flow&quot;. As early as the &quot;Polar Circle&quot; feasibility group, which conducted its capability assessment at the Defense Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Arlington Hall facility rather than the Pentagon, members of the rescue operation were isolated from contact with outside organizations and closely monitored to prevent accidental leaks to the curious that might irreparably harm security. In his history of the operation, John Gargus, a planner and participant, has no evidence that anyone in the intelligence community knew the POWs had been removed from the Son Tay Camp. However he conceded the possibility of the existence of compartmented scraps of intelligence of such a nature: &quot;We concede that the raid was allowed to take place because those who had the correct intelligence information were not aware that someone was contemplating a POW rescue.&quot;

By the time the only intelligence implying the lack of prisoners at Son Tay was received (the coded message in a pack of cigarettes which listed POW camps and the number of POWs in each—with no mention of Son Tay), prompting the Defense Intelligence Agency to do an intensive overnight re-analysis of all of its data, it was the day before the raid would launch. The finished overnight report was presented to the commanders (including Admiral Moorer) the day of the operation. The operation had been advanced 24 hours due to Typhoon Patsy and there was a 12-hour time difference with Southeast Asia. When a final meeting with Defense Secretary Laird took place at 05:00 (Washington, D.C., time) to determine if the mission should proceed, its launch was less than five hours away. There was no consensus on the reliability of the data and Blackburn was strongly predisposed to go ahead. One military analyst theorized that as a result, the highest-level decision makers succumbed to the phenomenon of &quot;groupthink&quot;.

The Defense Department conducted an investigation into a possible breach of security as the reason behind the movement of the prisoners and concluded that none occurred. The intensity of the criticism, and leaks of information including reports of the operation, caused the Nixon Administration to reorganize both the military communications network and the government&#x27;s intelligence apparatus.

=== Recognition of participants ===
For their actions, members of the task force received six Distinguished Service Crosses, five Air Force Crosses, and at least 85 Silver Stars, including all members of the ground force who did not receive the DSC. Manor received the Distinguished Service Medal. A total of 49 soldiers were awarded the Silver Star for heroism. The successful demonstrations of joint operating capability in &quot;Ivory Coast&quot; and &quot;Kingpin&quot; were, in part, a model for the creation of a joint United States Special Operations Command in 1987.

=== Impact of the raid ===
Criticism of the raid, particularly in the news media and by political opponents of the Vietnam War and the Nixon Administration, was widespread and of long duration. Not only was the mission denounced as the result of poor or outdated intelligence, but charges were made that the operation caused increased mistreatment of the prisoners.

However, as a result of the raid, the North Vietnamese consolidated their POW camps to central prison complexes. An area of the &quot;Hanoi Hilton&quot; formerly housing civilian and South Vietnamese prisoners became &quot;Camp Unity&quot;, a block of large communal areas housing 50 POWs each. After their repatriation, many POWs said that being in close contact with other Americans lifted their morale, as did knowledge of the rescue attempt. Some POWs said that food, medical care and even seemingly basic things like mail delivery vastly improved after the raid.

<doc id="375302" wikidata="Q734818" url="?curid=375302" title="Condominium (international law)">
<text>A condominium (plural either condominia, as in Latin, or condominiums) in international law is a territory (such as a border area or a state) in or over which multiple sovereign powers formally agree to share equal &quot;dominium&quot; (in the sense of sovereignty) and exercise their rights jointly, without dividing it into &quot;national&quot; zones.

Although a condominium has always been recognized as a theoretical possibility, condominia have been rare in practice. A major problem, and the reason so few have existed, is the difficulty of ensuring co-operation between the sovereign powers; once the understanding fails, the status is likely to become untenable.

The word is recorded in English since 1718, from Modern Latin, apparently coined in Germany c. 1700 from Latin &quot;con-&quot; &#x27;together&#x27; + &quot;dominium&quot; &#x27;right of ownership&#x27; (compare domain). A condominium of three sovereign powers is sometimes called a tripartite condominium or tridominium.

== Current condominia ==


== Co-principality ==
Under French law, Andorra was once considered to be a French–Spanish condominium, although it is more commonly classed as a co-principality, since it is itself a sovereign state, not a possession of one or more foreign powers. However, the position of head of state is shared &quot;ex officio&quot; by two foreigners, one of whom is the President of France, currently Emmanuel Macron, and the other the Bishop of Urgell in Spain, currently Joan Enric Vives i Sicília.

== Former condominia ==
* Allied-occupied Germany and subsequently East Germany, West Germany, and West Berlin were under the control of the Allied Control Council, which consisted of representatives from France, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom from 1945 until 1990.
* In 688 the Byzantine Emperor Justinian II and the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan reached an unprecedented agreement to establish a condominium (the concept did not yet exist) over Cyprus, with the collected taxes from the island being equally divided between the two parties. The arrangement lasted for some 300 years, even though in the same time there was nearly constant warfare between the two parties on the mainland. 
* Fellesdistrikt (, ) was a Russo-Norwegian condominium comprising Sør-Varanger Municipality and the Pechengsky District from 1684 until 1826.
* Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was legally an Egyptian-British condominium from 1899 until 1956, although in reality Egypt played no role in its government other than providing some administrators in the country: all political decisions were made by the United Kingdom and all Governors-General of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan were British. The system was resented by Egyptian and Sudanese nationalists, and would later be disavowed by the Egyptian Government, although it persisted due to the United Kingdom&#x27;s effective control over Egypt itself, which began from 1882 and continued until at least 1936.
* The Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina was jointly ruled by Cisleithanian Austria and Transleithanian Hungary between 1908 and 1918, while both countries were parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
* An islet in the border river Brömsebäck was considered to belong to neither (or both) Denmark and Sweden.
* The Duchy of Courland was a condominium of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown of Poland from 1726 until 1795.
* The Independent State of Croatia during World War II from 1941 to 1943 was a military condominium of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy until 1943, when Italy split between the Allied-leaning Kingdom of Italy under King Victor Emmanuel III and Axis-leaning Italian Social Republic under Benito Mussolini.
* Canton and Enderbury Islands were a British–American condominium from 1939 until 1979 when they became part of Kiribati.
* Couto Misto was shared until 1864 between Spain and Portugal, even though in its final decades of existence it was &quot;de facto&quot; independent.
* Egypt from 1876 to 1882 was under France and the United Kingdom.
* A small area (Hadf and surroundings) on the Arabian Peninsula, a part of Oman, at one time was jointly ruled with the Emirati member state of Ajman. The agreement defining the Hadf zone was signed in Salalah on 26 April 1960 by Sultan Said bin Taimur and in Ajman on 30 April 1960 by Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi III, ruler of Ajman. This provided for some joint supervision in the zone by the ruler of Ajman and the shaikhs under the rule of Muscat. It allowed the Ajman ruler to continue collecting zakat (Islamic tax). The ruler of Ajman was, however, not to interfere in the affairs of the local people, the &quot;Bani Ka&#x27;ab&quot; (a branch of the Banu Kaab), which were the sole responsibility of shaikhs who were under Muscat rule. The agreement was later terminated.
*The Holy Roman Empire hosted numerous condominia within its boundaries. Many princes and especially Imperial knights and counts mortgaged partial ownership or rights within their lands to the Emperor, sometimes in perpetuity. Most of these were located in the Swabian Circle, close to the Emperor&#x27;s personal domains in Further Austria. Some condominia were shared by lesser princes, especially in cases of inheritances held in common by branches of a princely line. Disputes over condominium contracts were submitted to the Imperial court at Wetzlar, or petitioned to the Emperor himself. Some cases within the Holy Roman Empire included the following:
** The City of Bergedorf was a condominium of the Imperial cities of Hamburg and Lübeck, and the terms were extended beyond the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s dissolution until 1868, when Lübeck sold its rights in Bergedorf to Hamburg.
** The City of Erfurt from 12th century until the Thirty Years&#x27; War was shared between the Archbishopric of Mainz and the Counts of Gleichen, the latter replaced by the city council in 1289 (Concordata Gebhardi), the Landgrave of Thuringia in 1327 and the House of Wettin in 1483 (Treaty of Weimar).
** The County of Friesland (West Frisia) was from 1165 to 1493 a joint condominium of the County of Holland and the Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht, then again until 25 October 1555 under Imperial administration.
** The Imperial village of Holzhausen was a partial condominium, two thirds of which was immediate to the Emperor and the remaining third subject to various landlords. 
** The City of Maastricht was a condominium for five centuries until 1794. It was shared between the Prince-Bishopric of Liège and the Duchy of Brabant, the latter replaced by the Dutch Republic in 1632.
** The village of Nennig was a condominium of the Trier bishopric, Lorraine (the Kingdom of France from 1766) and Duchy of Luxembourg until its annexation by Revolutionary France in 1794.
** The County of Sponheim was ruled since the 15th century by the Margraves of Baden, the Counts Palatine of the Rhine and the Counts of Veldenz, later Palatinate-Simmern, Palatine Zweibrücken and Palatinate-Birkenfeld as heirs of Veldenz.
* The Free City of Kraków was a protectorate of Prussia, Austria and Russia from 1815 until 1846, when it was annexed by Austria.
* Neutral Moresnet was shared from 1816 until 1919 between the Netherlands (later Belgium) and Prussia.
* Nauru was a tripartite condominium mandate territory administered by Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom from 1923 to 1942 and again in 1947 as a UN trust territory until independence in 1968.
* New Hebrides formed a French–British condominium in 1906 until independence in 1980 as a republic, now called Vanuatu.
* Northern Dobruja was shared by the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria) during World War I.
* The Oregon Country was an Anglo-American condominium from 1818 until 1846. It would later become the Pacific Northwest of the United States and British Columbia in Canada. 
* Samoan Islands from 1889 to 1899 were a rare tripartite condominium under joint protectorate of Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. It would later become Samoa and American Samoa. 
*Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg were an Austrian-Prussian condominium. The two German powers acceded it following the 1864 Second Schleswig War. According to the Gastein Convention in the next year, Lauenburg left the condominium (to Prussia), Austria governed Holstein and Prussia controlled Schleswig. In 1866, after the Austro-Prussian War, Austria passed over its remaining rights to Prussia. Prussia later created the Province of Schleswig-Holstein, which would become divided between Germany and Denmark after the Treaty of Versailles.
* The Spanish Netherlands became an Anglo-Dutch condominium in 1706 during the War of the Spanish Succession, until the peace treaties of Utrecht and Rastatt in 1713/14 ending the war.
* Togoland, formerly a German protectorate, was an Anglo-French condominium, from when the United Kingdom and France occupied it on 26 August 1914 until its partition on 27 December 1916 into French and British zones. The divided Togoland became two separate League of Nations mandates on 20 July 1922: British Togoland, which joined Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) in 1956, and French Togoland, which is now the nation of Togo.
* Zaporozhian Sich, a brief condominium between Russia and Poland-Lithuania, was established in 1667 by the Treaty of Andrusovo.
* Tangier International Zone, an international zone nominally under Moroccan sovereignty but jointly administered by several European powers in 1924. It was returned to full Moroccan sovereignty in 1956.
* The term is sometimes even applied to a similar arrangement between members of a Monarch&#x27;s countries in (personal or formal) union, as was the case for the district of Fiume (what is today Rijeka, Republic of Croatia), shared between Hungary and Croatia within the Habsburg Empire since 1868. 
* Between 1913 and 1920 Spitsbergen was a neutral condominium. The Spitsbergen Treaty of 9 February 1920 recognises the full and absolute sovereignty of Norway over all the arctic archipelago of Svalbard. The exercise of sovereignty is, however, subject to certain stipulations, and not all Norwegian law applies. Originally limited to nine signatory nations, over 40 are now signatories of the treaty. Citizens of any of the signatory countries may settle in the archipelago. Currently, only Norway and Russia make use of this right.
* In 1992, South Africa and Namibia established a Joint Administrative Authority in the enclave of Walvis Bay, prior to its cession to Namibia in 1994.
* The Saudi Arabian–Kuwaiti neutral zone was established in 1922 by the Uqair Convention. It was a 2,000 square mile area designed to accommodate the Bedouin people, a nomadic group who regularly crossed through the Saudi and Kuwaiti border. The area was partitioned in 1970 after a 1938 discovery of oil near the zone brought speculation that there may be oil in the condominium.

==Proposed condominia==
* In a 2019 essay, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd suggested that Australia should consider a &quot;formal constitutional condominium&quot; with Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu as a solution to the impacts of climate change. Rudd outlined that the people of these countries would be offered Australian citizenship and relocation to Australian territory in exchange for Australian ownership of their territorial seas, exclusive economic zones, and fisheries.
* In 2001, the British government held discussions with Spain with a view to putting a proposal for joint sovereignty to the people of Gibraltar. This initiative was pre-emptively rejected by Gibraltarians in the 2002 referendum.
* In 2012, the Canadian and Danish governments were close to an agreement to declare Hans Island a condominium, after decades in dispute. In June 2022, the Danish, Greenlandic, Canadian, and Nunavut governments instead decided to divide the island in half.
* In the talks between the UK and the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1983–84 over the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, one of the British proposals was to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong and its dependencies to the People&#x27;s Republic of China while the UK would retain the rights of administration of the territory. The proposal was rejected and negotiations ended with the UK agreeing to relinquish all rights over Hong Kong to China in 1997.
* In 1984, the New Ireland Forum suggested a proposal for joint UK/Irish authority in Northern Ireland to try to bring an end to the Troubles conflict. This idea was dismissed by the British government. The Good Friday Agreement of 1998 led to the establishment of a devolved power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive led jointly by the First and Deputy First Minister, positions nominated separately by the largest parties in each of the two largest community designations in the assembly. The proposal of joint authority by the UK and Irish governments over Northern Ireland was raised again in 2017 after the Irish backstop issue during the negotiations for the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the collapse of the power-sharing executive during the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.
* During the Croatian War of Independence speculative ideas on the peaceful settlement of the conflict included condominium proposals. In 1991 Serbian lawyer Smilja Avramov presented to Croatian negotiators her condominium proposal for the Serb controlled areas. In the later stages of war, in 1994 and 1995, United Kingdom diplomats circulated their territory swap proposals which included the idea on the creation of condominium between Croatia and FR Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) over the self-proclaimed Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. Croatian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mate Granić subsequently claimed that the idea was rejected by him in 1994.

<text>A condominium (or condo for short) is an ownership regime in which a building (or group of buildings) is divided into multiple units that are either each separately owned, or owned in common with exclusive rights of occupation by individual owners. These individual units are surrounded by common areas that are jointly owned and managed by the owners of the units. The term can be applied to the building or complex itself, and is sometimes applied to individual units. The term &quot;condominium&quot; is mostly used in the US and Canada, but similar arrangements are used in many other countries under different names.

Residential condominiums are frequently constructed as apartment buildings, referred as well as Horizontal Property. There are also rowhouse style condominiums, in which the units open directly to the outside and are not stacked. Alternatively, detached condominiums look like single-family homes, but the yards (gardens), building exteriors, and streets, as well as any recreational facilities (such as a pool, bowling alley, tennis courts, and golf course), are jointly owned and maintained by a community association. Many shopping malls are commercial condominiums in which the individual retail and office spaces are owned by the businesses that occupy them, while the common areas of the mall are collectively owned by all the business entities that own the individual spaces. 

Unlike apartments, which are leased by their tenants, in most systems condominium units are owned outright, and the owners of the individual units also collectively own the common areas of the property, such as the exterior of the building, roof, corridors/hallways, walkways, and laundry rooms, as well as common utilities and amenities, such as the HVAC system and elevators. In other property regimes, such as those in Hong Kong and Finland, the entire buildings are owned in common with exclusive rights to occupy units assigned to the individual owners. The common areas, amenities, and utilities are managed collectively by the owners through their association, such as a homeowner association or its equivalent.

Scholars have traced the earliest known use of the condominium form of tenure to a document from first-century Babylon. The word &quot;&quot; originated in Latin.
== Etymology ==

&quot;Condominium&quot; is an invented Latin word formed by adding the prefix &quot;con-&quot; &#x27;together&#x27; to the word &quot;dominium&quot; &#x27;dominion, ownership&#x27;. Its meaning is, therefore, &#x27;joint dominion&#x27; or &#x27;co-ownership&#x27;.

&quot;Condominia&quot; (the Latin plural of &quot;condominium&quot;) originally referred to territories over which two or more sovereign powers shared joint sovereignty. This technique was frequently used to settle border disputes when multiple claimants could not agree on how to partition the disputed territory. For example, from 1818 to 1846, Oregon Country was a condominium over which both the United States and Great Britain shared joint sovereignty until the Oregon Treaty resolved the issue by splitting the territory along the 49th parallel and each country gaining sole sovereignty of one side.

== Overview ==

The distinction between a complex of residences, such as an apartment building, and a condominium is purely legal. There is no way to differentiate a condominium from any other residential building simply by looking at it or visiting it. What defines a condominium is the form of ownership. A building developed as a condominium (and &quot;sold&quot; in individual units to different &quot;owners&quot;) could actually be built at another location as (for example) an apartment building (the developers would retain ownership and &quot;rent&quot; individual units to different &quot;tenants&quot;).

Where a condominium is in essence an apartment building, as a practical matter, builders tend to build condominiums to higher quality standards than apartment complexes because of the differences between the rental and sale markets. They are typically slightly larger than apartments and are often constructed in a townhouse style in regions where single-family detached homes are common.

Technically, a condominium is a collection of individual units and common areas along with the land upon which they sit. Individual home ownership within a condominium is construed as ownership of only the air space confining the boundaries of the home. The boundaries of that space are specified by a legal document known in the United States as a Declaration, filed on record with the local governing authority. These boundaries may extend to the interior side of the walls surrounding a condo, allowing the homeowner to make some interior modifications without impacting the common area. Anything outside this boundary is held in an undivided ownership interest by a corporation established at the time of the condominium&#x27;s creation. The corporation holds this property in trust on behalf of the homeowners as a group—it may not have ownership itself.

Some condominium complexes consist of single-family dwellings. There are also &quot;detached condominiums&quot; where homeowners do not maintain the exteriors of the dwellings or yards, and &quot;site condominiums&quot;, where the owner has more control and possibly ownership (as in a &quot;whole lot&quot; or &quot;lot line&quot; condominium) over the exterior appearance. These structures are preferred by some planned neighborhoods and gated communities.

== Founding documents and bylaws ==

The description of the condominium units and the common areas and any restrictions on their use are established in a founding document, which may variously be called a &quot;Master Deed&quot;, &quot;Enabling Declaration&quot;, &quot;Declaration of Conditions&quot;, &quot;Conditions, Covenants, and Restrictions (CC&amp;Rs)&quot;, &quot;Deed of Mutual Covenant&quot; or simply a &quot;Condominium Document&quot;. Among other things, this document can provide for the creation of a governing body or corporation, for example, a Homeowner&#x27;s Association in the United States.

Rules for the association may be in the master deed, or could be a separate set of bylaws governing the internal affairs of the condominium. Matters addressed in the condominium bylaws may include the responsibilities of the owners&#x27; association, voting procedures to be used at association meetings, the qualifications, powers, and duties of the board of directors, and the powers and duties of the officers. The Bylaws may also cover the obligations of the owners with regard to assessments, maintenance, and use of the units and common areas, although those obligations are often found in the condominium&#x27;s founding documents. Finally, they may set limits on the conduct of unit owners and residents. These are more readily amendable than the declaration or association bylaws, typically requiring only a vote of the governing body. Typical rules include mandatory maintenance fees (perhaps collected monthly), pet restrictions, and color/design choices visible from the exterior of the units. Generally, these sets of rules and regulations are made available to residents and or as a matter of public record, via a condominium or homeowners association website, or through public files, depending on the state and its applicable laws. Condominiums are usually owned in fee simple title, but can be owned in ways that other real estate can be owned, such as title held in trust. In some jurisdictions, such as Ontario, Canada, or Hawaii US, there are &quot;leasehold condominiums&quot; where the development is built on leased land.

As condominium unit owners may wish to rent their home to tenants, similar to renting out single-owner real estate, but leasing rights may be subject to conditions or restrictions set forth in the declaration (such as a rental cap for the total number of units in a community that can be leased at one time) or otherwise as permitted by local law.

== Homeowners association ==

A homeowners association (HOA), whose members are the unit owners, manages the condominium through a board of directors elected by the membership. This exists under various names depending on the jurisdiction, such as &quot;unit title&quot;, &quot;sectional title&quot;, &quot;commonhold&quot;, &quot;strata council&quot;, or &quot;tenant-owner&#x27;s association&quot;, &quot;body corporate&quot;, &quot;Owners Corporation&quot;, &quot;condominium corporation&quot; or &quot;condominium association&quot;. Another variation of this concept is the &quot;time share&quot;, although not all time shares are condominiums, and not all time shares involve actual ownership of (i.e., deeded title to) real property. Condominiums may be found in both civil law and common law legal systems as it is purely a creation of statute. Among other things, the HOA assesses unit owners for the costs of maintaining the common areas, etc. That is, the HOA decides how much each owner should pay and has the legal power to collect that.

== Non-residential uses ==

Condominium ownership is also used, albeit less frequently, for non-residential land uses: offices, hotel rooms, retail shops, private airports, marinas, group housing facilities (retirement homes or dormitories), bare land (in British Columbia) and storage. The legal structure is the same, and many of the benefits are similar; for instance, a nonprofit corporation may face a lower tax liability in an office condominium than in an office rented from a taxable, for-profit company. However, the frequent turnover of commercial land uses in particular can make the inflexibility of condominium arrangements problematic.

== By country ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, condominiums are known as &quot;strata title schemes&quot; or &quot;community title schemes&quot;.

=== Canada ===
The 2011 National Household Survey (NHS) showed that one in eight Canadian households lived in condominium dwellings, colloquially known as &quot;condos&quot;, mostly located in a few censuses metropolitan areas according to Statistics Canada. Condominiums exist in most parts of Canada, though they are more common in larger cities. They are regulated under provincial or territorial legislation, and specific legal details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In most parts of Canada, they are referred to as condominiums, except in British Columbia, where they are referred to as a &quot;strata&quot;, and in Quebec, where they are referred to as &quot;syndicates of co-ownership&quot;. The townhouse complex of Brentwood Village in Edmonton, Alberta, was the first condominium development in Canada (registered in 1967). With regular condominiums, the unit owner usually owns the internal unit space and a share of the corporation; the corporation owns the exterior of the building land and common area; in the case of a &quot;freehold condominium&quot; the owner owns the land and building and the corporation owns common shared roadways and amenities. The Canadian Condominium Institute is a non-profit association of condominium owners and corporations with chapters in each province and territory. The Condo Owners Association COA Ontario is a non-profit association representing condominium owners with divisions across the province and districts within the various municipalities.

=== Denmark ===
Apartments (Danish &quot;ejerlejlighed&quot;, literally &quot;owner-apartment&quot;) comprise some 5% of Danish homes.
They are traded and mortgaged on the same markets as freestanding houses, and are treated legally much like other forms of real estate. Each owner-tenant directly owns their own apartment; the rest of the building and the ground on which it stands is owned jointly by the apartment owners, who execute their joint ownership through an &quot;owner&#x27;s association&quot;. The expenses of maintaining the joint property are shared &quot;pro rata&quot; among the owners.

Another 5% of Danish homes are in housing cooperatives (Danish &quot;andelsbolig&quot;), which occupy a legal position intermediate between condominiums and housing associations. The entire property is legally owned by a non-profit corporation, in which the tenants own shares; each share carries the right and duty to lease an apartment from the cooperative. Shares can be bought and sold, but often the cooperative&#x27;s rules strictly limit the price for which they may change hands. (In contrast, condominiums are traded on a free market). Because the official share prices are often lower than the market value and sellers often retain the freedom to select whom to sell to, under-the-table payments occur.

Current public policy favors condominiums over housing cooperatives, and recent legislation has aimed at making the latter more condominium-like. For example, since 2005, cooperative shares may be used to secure bank loans. (However, Danish mortgage banks still may not mortgage individual housing cooperative apartments.)

=== England and Wales ===

In England and Wales, one of the equivalent legal structures of a condominium is commonhold, a form of ownership introduced in September 2004. As of 3 June 2009, there were 12 commonhold residential developments comprising 97 units in England and one commonhold residential development, comprising 30 units, in Wales. &quot;Condominium&quot; is not a term that is widely used in England and Wales. Commonhold is a creature of statute and comparatively rare, and condominiums are more likely to be found in the form of leaseholds because of long-standing legal differences between leasehold and freehold tenure.

By virtue of the landmark case of &quot;Tulk v Moxhay&quot;, in English law only restrictive covenants can be enforced against freehold land. This means it is not possible to enforce a positive covenant on successive owners of freehold land, other than to maintain a boundary fence, without creating an elaborate trust. A positive covenant is, broadly, one that involves the expenditure of money to perform.

This did not create a significant problem until the 1950s when flats (where ownership is divided horizontally) first began to appear on the market as more affordable, particularly for first-time buyers. Until then flats had been confined to short-term unsaleable tenancies, with varying degrees of statutory rent protection and security of tenure.

It was soon learned that freehold flats were an unsatisfactory form of ownership because it was not possible to impose essential maintenance requirements. As such, flats became virtually unmarketable because they were an unacceptable form of security to lenders. Thus solicitors, the principal property lawyers in England and Wales in those days, began to use leases instead, where such limitations did not apply.

Progress was haphazard and piecemeal, but over time things became more standard. Improvements became universal as institutional lenders refused to advance money on the security of flats unless certain basic provisions were included. This benefited owners whether or not they borrowed money since the purchase was invariably conducted through a solicitor or licensed conveyancer trained to reject leases failing to meet the necessary standards.

Despite these standards, the actual form of leasehold systems is variable. Highly favoured are arrangements where the leases are granted out of a freehold owned by a corporation, itself owned by individual leaseholders. This provides an opportunity for them to participate in the proper management of the block. Again, the quality of management is very variable.

The statute creating commonholds was motivated by a desire to eliminate some of the problems and perceived injustices, such as the commercial exploitation of lessees by freeholders as their leases began to have too little time left to satisfy lenders. Since most leasehold developments are undertaken by commercial entities, commonholds did not become widespread. There are, however, other statutes in place that give some degree of protection for leaseholders. It is, nevertheless, essential to consider proper legal advice whenever engaged in the purchase of a flat, for the requirements for a fully marketable flat remain complex.

The Law of Property Act 1925, s. 153, contains provisions for the &quot;enlargement&quot; of leases into freeholds, one of the effects of which is to preserve the enforceability of positive covenants contained in the lease against the resulting freehold. There are clear, but stringent, requirements. Artificial schemes using the provisions to create enforceable positive covenants in freehold blocks of flats were occasionally mooted but never gained currency.

On 21 July 2020 the UK Law Commission reported on the existing difficulties and made proposals to improve the law and encourage the acceptance of commonhold as the preferred form of tenure.

=== Finland ===
In Finland, a condominium-like arrangement where the ownership of the real estate is assigned to specific apartments (, ) is usually used only with detached or semi-detached houses.

A housing cooperative is a common form of home ownership in Finland. Owning shares that correspond to one apartment in a housing company is generally considered as much &quot;owning your own home&quot; as actually directly owning a (single family) house. However, shares are not considered as real estate but as personal property and the co-op can take possession of the apartment for a term time and evict the tenant or owner because of disturbance or unpaid maintenance fees.

Finnish housing cooperatives are incorporated as (non-profit) limited-liability companies (, ), where one share usually represents one square meter (sometimes ten) of the apartment.

Membership in a condo is obtained by buying the shares on the open market, most often through a real estate agent. No board approval is needed to buy shares, but in some cases other stockholders or the housing cooperative itself has the right to claim the stocks being sold. There is usually no requirement for the owner(s) to live in the condo. Owning apartments for rent is a common form of saving and private investment in Finland.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, condominiums are known as () and the most important law considering condominiums is the (abbreviated WoEigG). It is the basis for all legal regulations involving individual freehold ownership, the rights, and duties of homeowner associations, and the management of condominiums. The WoEigG dates back to 1951, but it was re-enacted in 2007. Now, homeowners are invested with partial legal capacity, which means that the homeowner association represents an entity with rights and duties that may include contracts. The right of ownership is divided in the first article of the WoEigG into homeownership, individual freehold ownership, part ownership, and commonhold ownership.

=== Greece ===

In Greece, condominiums became very popular in the 1960s. It is a building one sees everywhere in Greece, since most of its population lives in big cities. They are known as (), literally &quot;multi-residences&quot;.

=== Hong Kong ===
In Hong Kong the equivalent to a condominium is a &quot;multi-owner building&quot; or &quot;building in multiple ownership&quot;. These are sometimes part of a private housing estate comprising multiple buildings but often consist of a single building owned in common. The relationships among the parties, including rights of exclusive occupation of flats and parking spaces, are defined by the deed of mutual covenant (&quot;DMC&quot;, analogous to the master deed described above) and the Building Management Ordinance Cap. 344.

=== Hungary ===
Condominiums are a very common form of real estate ownership in contemporary Hungary, as most state- or municipality-owned apartments were privatized following the end of socialism in Hungary in 1989. Historically, condominiums () were formalized as a legal ownership structure as early as 1924.

Condominiums in Hungary are traded and mortgaged on the same market as any free-standing single-family home (; &quot;garden-house&quot;), and are treated much like other forms of real estate. The condominium acts as a non-profit legal entity maintaining the common areas of the property, and is managed by a representative () elected by the owners&#x27; convention. Historically, this representative was one of the owners themselves; in the 21st century, however, the owners&#x27; convention typically hires a professional building manager who does not personally live in the building. Decisions that involve changes to the terms and conditions, or larger common expenses, still need to be approved by the convention, however. Voting power is based on the percentage of property owned.

=== India ===

In India, condominiums are known as &quot;Apartments&quot; or &quot;Apartment Buildings/Complexes&quot; or &quot;Societies&quot; or &quot;Flats&quot;. Each building consists of multiple floors and flats/living units with different configurations. The most common configurations are &quot;1-BHK&quot;, &quot;2-BHK&quot; and &quot;3-BHK&quot; (BHK stands for bedroom-hall-kitchen).

The association of homeowners has many names - two common names are Resident Welfare Association (RWA) and the other being a Co-operative Housing Society (CHS) or Co-operative Group Housing Society (CGHS), which needs to be registered with the municipal authorities.

=== Iran===
Iranian government has begun supporting villas and opposing apartment building concerned by people&#x27;s manner.

=== Israel ===
In Israel, condominiums (known &quot;בתים משותפים&quot;, &quot;shared houses&quot; or &quot;cooperative houses&quot;) are a common form of home ownership. Public housing has historically been organized as subsidized purchases and mortgages in government-constructed condominiums.

===Italy===
In Italy, the condominium (&quot;Condominio&quot;) is governed by law, last reformed in 2012. Co-ownership of the common parts of the buildings (such as the stairs, main walls, facades, roof, and courtyards) is mandatory: a landlord can not give up the right to common parts for not paying the costs. Each owner&#x27;s quota in the condominium is expressed in thousandths (&quot;millesimi&quot;) of the whole; these are used to determine majorities in owners&#x27; assemblies (&quot;assemblee condominiali&quot;).

===The Netherlands===

See housing cooperative under &quot;owners association&quot;.

=== Norway ===

Condominiums (Norwegian &quot;Eierseksjon&quot;) was formally introduced in 1983. Approximately 19% of Norwegian homes are condominiums, as approximately 50% of the owner-occupied flats and duplexes, approximately 30% of the rowhouses, and 2.5% of the detached houses are organized as condominiums.

=== Pakistan ===

The title &quot;Condominiums&quot; is not used in Pakistan rather they are called &quot;Flats&quot; for average-style buildings while &quot;Complexes&quot; for sophisticated and larger buildings. The minimum number of floors for a building to be classified as &quot;Flats&quot; is four, with a requirement for having at least one elevator or lift for buildings upwards of four floors. Almost all have a separate room called the &quot;Drawing Room&quot;, used for guest entertainment purposes. However, its use as a TV room and dining room is common. Another unique feature is the balcony or &quot;terrace&quot;, which is standard for all flats.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, condominiums are classified into three types: low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise. Condos have a special type of ownership title called a CCT - condominium certificate of title. Condominiums usually have amenities, like swimming pools, owned parking, a clubhouse, and a building for administration.

=== Russia ===

Initially, the concept of a condominium was introduced by the Federal Law &quot;On the Fundamentals of the Federal Housing Policy&quot; No. 4218-1 dated December 24, 1992: &quot;Condominium is an association of owners of residential premises in apartment buildings with the establishment of conditions for joint ownership and use of inter-apartment stairs, elevators, corridors, roofs, technical basements, non-apartment engineering equipment, adjacent territory, and other common areas.

=== Singapore ===

In Singapore and Malaysia, &quot;Condo&quot; or &quot;Condominium&quot; are terms used for housing buildings with some special luxury features like security guards, swimming pools, or tennis courts.

In Singapore, most houses without such features are built by the governmental Housing Development Board (HDB), and such HDB units can be possessed for rent or individually bought from the government. Condominiums and HDB flats make up the overwhelming majority of available residential housing in the country.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, condominiums are known as &quot;Sectional Title&quot; properties and are governed by the Sectional Titles Act No. 95 of 1986. Town-house complexes and many apartment blocks typically have this form of title. The owners of the complex constitute the Body Corporate, and the Body Corporate elects a group of Trustees to manage the day-to-day management of the complex, who often hire a company specialising in complex management, known as a Managing Agent. 

=== Spain ===
In Spain, condominiums are known as &quot;comunidad de propietarios&quot; (legal term) and &quot;comunidad de vecinos&quot; (popular term), and are governed by the Ley de Propiedad Horizontal (L.P.H.) which significantly extends the Spanish Civil Code. L.P.H. became the law in 1960 and more than half of the Spanish population live in condominiums. According to INE, there are almost 840,000 condominiums in Spain which comprise around 9 million habitat buildings.

=== Sweden ===
On 1 May 2009, condominiums (&quot;ägarlägenheter&quot;) became available for the first time under Swedish law. Of the 14,447 newly built apartments completed in 2009, only six were condominiums. A majority of production, 7,723 units, were apartments in housing cooperatives (&quot;bostadsrättslägenheter&quot;), the traditional form of owner-occupied apartment housing. As of late 2014, there were 955 condominiums total throughout all of Sweden.

=== Thailand ===
Nationwide, as of February 2018, Bangkok represented 58% of Thailand&#x27;s new construction condominium market while the other provinces accounted for the remaining 42%. The unit type has seen steady growth in the Thai market over the previous decades, in contrast to the declining percentage in the traditional detached house. The condo development trend continues nationwide as dozens of projects are in progress in Bangkok, several others are underway in the Eastern Economic Corridor provinces of Chon Buri and Rayong, and to the west in Phetchaburi and Prachuap Khiri Khan.

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, condominiums have become increasingly popular, especially in urban areas like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The Law on Residential Housing (No. 65/2014/QH13), effective since July 1, 2015, allows foreigners to purchase condominiums in Vietnam. However, there are restrictions: foreigners can own up to 30% of the apartments in a condominium and a maximum of 250 individual houses within a designated area. The ownership period is limited to 50 years, with an option to extend for another 50 years. This law aims to attract foreign investment while ensuring that the majority of housing remains accessible to Vietnamese citizens.

=== United States ===
The first condominium law passed in the United States was in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in 1958. In 1960, the first condominium in the continental U.S. was built in Salt Lake City, Utah. The legal concept had spread to the U.S. from Europe via the Caribbean (Puerto Rico and Cuba) but throughout the 1960s it was widely and erroneously reported that the concept had arisen in the U.S. directly based on a Roman model. In fact, the concept of an estate in the air was antithetical to Roman law, and there is no evidence of an ancient Roman &quot;condominio&quot;.

Section 234 of the Housing Act of 1961 allowed the Federal Housing Administration to insure mortgages on condominiums, leading to a vast increase in the funds available for condominiums, and to condominium laws in every state by 1969. Since then, the term ‘condominium’, or ‘condo’ for short, has become a household word in the U.S. Many Americans&#x27; first widespread awareness of condominium life came not from its largest cities but from South Florida, where developers had imported the condominium concept from Puerto Rico and used it to sell thousands of inexpensive homes to retirees arriving flush with cash from the urban northern U.S.

The primary attraction to this type of ownership is the ability to obtain affordable housing in a highly desirable area that typically is beyond economic reach. Additionally, such properties benefit from having restrictions that maintain and enhance value, providing control over blight that plagues some neighborhoods.

Over the past several decades, the residential condominium industry has been booming in some metropolitan areas, such as Miami, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston, Chicago, Austin, Los Angeles, and New York City. However, in recent years, supply within the condo industry has caught up with demand, and sales have slowed. It is now in a slowdown phase.

An alternative form of ownership, popular in parts of the U.S. but found also in other common law jurisdictions, is housing cooperative, also known as &quot;company share&quot; or &quot;co-op&quot;. A Housing Cooperative is where the building has an associated legal company and ownership of shares gives the right to a lease for the residence of a unit. Another form is ground rent (&quot;solarium&quot;) in which a single landlord retains ownership of the land (&quot;solum&quot;) but leases the surface rights (&quot;superficies&quot;) which renew in perpetuity or over a very long term.

In the U.S., there are several different styles of condominium complexes. For example, a garden condominium complex consists of low-rise buildings built with landscaped grounds surrounding them. A townhouse condominium complex consists of multi-floor semi-detached homes. In condominium townhouses, the purchaser owns only the interior, while the building itself is owned by a condominium corporation. The corporation is jointly owned by all the owners and charges them fees for general maintenance and major repairs. Freehold townhouses are exclusively owned, without any condominium aspects. In the U.S., this type of ownership is called fee simple.

New York&#x27;s Condominium Act was passed in 1964. The first condominium building was the St. Tropez Condominium in Manhattan, built in 1965.

<text>The Penobscot (Abenaki: &quot;Pαnawάhpskewi&quot;) are an Indigenous people in North America from the Northeastern Woodlands region. They are organized as a federally recognized tribe in Maine and as a First Nations band government in the Atlantic provinces and Quebec.

The &quot;Penobscot Nation&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;Penobscot Tribe of Maine,&quot; is the federally recognized tribe of Penobscot in the United States. They are part of the Wabanaki Confederacy, along with the Abenaki, Passamaquoddy, Wolastoqiyik, and Miꞌkmaq nations, all of whom historically spoke Algonquian languages. The Penobscots&#x27; main settlement is now the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation, located within the state of Maine along the Penobscot River.

==Name==

The Penobscot&#x27;s name for themselves, &quot;Pαnawάhpskewi&quot;, means &quot;the people of where the white rocks extend out&quot;. It originally referred to their territory on the portion of the Penobscot River between present-day Old Town and Verona Island, Maine. It was misheard by European colonizers as &quot;Penobscot&quot;, which gives them their name today.

==Government==
The Penobscot Nation is headquartered in Penobscot Indian Island Reservation, Maine. The tribal chief is Kirk Francis. The vice-chief is Bill Thompson. The Penobscot are invited to send a nonvoting representative to the Maine House of Representatives.

In 2005, Penobscot Nation began a relationship with Venezuela&#x27;s government led by Hugo Chavez. It accepted aid in the form of heating oil. Tribal chief Kirk Francis traveled to New York City to meet with Chavez.

==History==
===Pre-contact===
Indigenous peoples are thought to have inhabited Maine and surrounding areas for at least 11,000 years. They had a hunting-gathering society, with the men hunting beaver, otters, moose, bears, caribou, fish, seafood (clams, mussels, fish), birds, and possibly marine mammals such as seals. The women gathered and processed bird eggs, berries, nuts, and roots, all of which were found locally.

People on the present-day Maine coast practiced some agriculture, but not to the same extent as that of Indigenous peoples in southern New England, where the climate was more temperate. Food was potentially scarce only toward the end of the winter, in February and March. For the rest of the year, the Penobscot and other Wabanaki likely had little difficulty surviving because the land and ocean waters offered much bounty, and the number of people was sustainable. The bands moved seasonally, following the patterns of game and fish.

===Contact and colonization===
During the 16th century the Penobscot had contact with Europeans through the fur trade. It was lucrative and the Penobscot were willing to trade pelts for European goods such as metal axes, guns, and copper or iron cookware. Hunting for fur pelts reduced the game, however, and the European trade introduced alcohol to Penobscot communities for the first time. It has been argued that the people are genetically vulnerable to alcoholism, a racist sentiment with no evidence which Europeans frequently tried to exploit in dealings and trade. Penobscot people and other nations made pine beer, which had vitamin C; in addition to being an alcoholic beverage, it had the benefit of allaying the onset of scurvy.

When European colonizers arrived, they brought alcohol in quantity. Europeans may have slowly developed enzymes, metabolic processes, and social mechanisms for dealing with a normalized high intake of alcohol, but Penobscot people, though familiar with alcohol, had never had access to the gross quantity of alcohol that Europeans offered.

The Europeans carried endemic infectious diseases of Eurasia to the Americas, and the Penobscot had no acquired immunity. Their fatality rates from the introduction of measles, smallpox and other infectious diseases was high. The population also declined due to further encroachment by settlers who cut off access to the Penobscot&#x27;s main food source of running fish through the process of damming the Penobscot River, the loss of big game through the process of clear cutting of forests for the logging industry and through massacres carried out by settlers. This catastrophic population depletion may have contributed to Christian conversion (among other factors); the people could see that the European priests did not suffer from the pandemics. The latter said that the Penobscot had died because they did not believe in Jesus Christ.

At the beginning of the 17th century, Europeans began to live year-round in Wabanaki territory. At this time, there were probably about 10,000 Penobscot (a number which fell to below 500 by the early 19th century). As contact became more permanent, after about 1675, conflicts arose through differences in cultures, conceptions of property, and competition for resources. Along the Atlantic Coast in present-day Canada, most settlers were French; in New England they were generally English speaking.

The Penobscot sided with the French during the French and Indian War in the mid-18th century (the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War) after British colonists demanded the Penobscot join their side or be considered hostile. In 1755, governor of Massachusetts Spencer Phips placed a scalp bounty on Penobscot. With a smaller population and greater acceptance of intermarriage, the French posed a lesser threat to the Penobscots&#x27; land and way of life.

After the French defeat in the Battle of Quebec in 1759, the Penobscot were left in a weakened position as they had lost their main European ally. During the American Revolution, the Penobscot sided with the Patriots and played an important role in the conflicts which occurred around the border between British Canada and the United States. Despite this the new American government did not seem to recognize their contributions. Anglo-American settlers continued to encroach on Penobscot lands.

In the following centuries, the Penobscot attempted to make treaties in order to hold on to some form of land, but, because they had no power of enforcement in Massachusetts or Maine, Americans kept encroaching on their lands. From about 1800 onward, the Penobscot lived on reservations, specifically, Indian Island, which is an island in the Penobscot River near Old Town, Maine. The Maine state government appointed a Tribal Agent to oversee the tribe. The government believed that they were helping the Penobscot, as stated in 1824 by the highest court in Maine that &quot;...imbecility on their parts, and the dictates of humanity on ours, have necessarily prescribed to them their subjection to our paternal control.&quot; This sentiment of &quot;imbecility&quot; set up a power dynamic in which the government treated the Penobscot as wards of the state and decided how their affairs would be managed. The government treated as charitable payments those Penobscot funds derived from land treaties and trusts, which the state had control over and used as it saw fit.

===Land claims===

In 1790, the young United States government enacted the Nonintercourse Act, which stated that the transfer of reservation lands to non-tribal members had to be approved by the United States Congress. Between the years of 1794 and 1833, the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy tribes ceded the majority of their lands to Massachusetts (then to Maine after it became a state in 1820) through treaties that were never ratified by the US Senate and that were illegal under the constitution, as only the federal government had the power to make such treaties. They were left only the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation.

In the 1970s, at a time of increasing assertions of sovereignty by Native Americans, the Penobscot Nation sued the state of Maine for land claims, calling for some sort of compensation in the form of land, money, and autonomy for the state&#x27;s violation of the Nonintercourse Act in the 19th century. The disputed land accounted for 60% of all of the land in Maine, and 35,000 people (the vast majority of whom were not tribal members) lived in the disputed territory.

The Penobscot and the state reached a settlement, Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act (MICSA), in 1980, resulting in an $81.5-million-dollar settlement that the Penobscot could use to acquire more tribal land. The terms of the settlement provided for such acquisition, after which the federal government would hold some of this land in trust for the tribe, as is done for reservation land. The tribe could also purchase other lands in the regular manner. The act established the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission, whose function was to oversee the effectiveness of the Act and to intervene in certain areas such as fishing rights, etc. in order to settle disputes between the state and the Penobscot or Passamaquoddy.

Because it is a federally recognized sovereign nation with direct relations with the federal government, the Penobscot have disagreed with state assertions that it has the power to regulate hunting and fishing by tribal members. The Nation filed suit against the state in August 2012, contending in &quot;Penobscot Nation v. State of Maine,&quot; that the 1980 MICSA settlement gave the Nation jurisdiction and regulatory authority over hunting and fishing in the &quot;Main Stem&quot; of the Penobscot River as well as on its reservation.

At the request of the Nation, the US Department of Justice has joined the suit on behalf of the tribe. In addition, in an unprecedented step, five members of the Congressional Native American Caucus representing other jurisdictions filed an &quot;amici curiae&quot; brief in support of the Penobscot in this case. In addition to its reservation, the Nation owns islands in the river extending upriver; it also acquired hundreds of thousands of acres of land elsewhere in the state, as a result of the 1980 settlement of its land claim. Some analysts predict that this case will be as significant to Indian law and sovereignty as the fishing rights cases of Native American tribes in the Pacific Northwest in the 1970s, which resulted in the 1974 Boldt decision affirming their rights to fishing and hunting in their former territories. The five members of the Congressional Native American Caucus who filed are Betty McCollum (D-MN), co-chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus with Tom Cole (R-OK) (Chickasaw); Raúl Grijalva, (D-AZ), vice chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus; Ron Kind (D-WI), vice chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus; and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), vice chair of the Congressional Native American Caucus.

==Language==
Penobscot people historically spoke a dialect of Eastern Abenaki, an Algonquian language. It is very similar to the languages of the other members of the Wabanaki Confederacy. There are no fluent speakers and the last known Penobscot speaker of Eastern Abenaki, Madeline Tower Shay, died in the 1990s. A dictionary was compiled by Frank Siebert. The elementary school and the Boys and Girls Club on Indian Island are making an effort to reintroduce the language by teaching it to the children. The written Penobscot language was developed with a modified Roman alphabet; distinct characters have been developed to represent sounds that do not exist in the Roman alphabet.

In 1643, Roger Williams wrote &quot;A Key into the Language of America&quot;. In this work, Williams explained that the language of the Narragansett people (and tribes they&#x27;d overtaken or forced into submission) used a language differing only from the northern Algonquian people, in dialect. He wrote that if one tribe&#x27;s language was known, communication with the other tribe was possible; this was the case all the way north to remote areas of Labrador. Natives in Labrador spoke Algonquian and the Labrador neighbors were of same linguistic stock as the Narragansett tribe. (Williams wrote that this was not the case with the drastically different Iroquois language.) Fluent in many languages, Williams had lived with native people to improve his native language skill before embarking on missionary work and authoring prayer conversion booklets. His opinion, Williams wrote, was that the Narragansett (hence the Algonquian) in many cases had words that were Hebrew or in a few cases Greek that he recognized from his work in old Hebrew and Greek biblical text translations. His book &quot;A Key into the Language of America&quot; includes a phonetic English dictionary that Williams wished to publish so that his knowledge of this Native American language would not die with him.

==Ethnobotany==
The Penobscot smear the sap of Abies balsamea over sores, burns, and cuts.

==Visual art==

===Baskets===
The Penobscot traditionally made baskets out of sweet grass, brown ash, and birch bark. These materials grow in wetlands throughout Maine. However, the species are threatened due to habitat destruction and the emerald ash borer. This insect threatens to destroy all ash trees in Maine, much as it already has devastated ash forests in the Midwest.

The baskets were traditionally made for practical use, but after European contact, the Penobscot began making &quot;fancy baskets&quot; for trade with the Europeans. Basket-making is traditionally a woman&#x27;s skill passed down in families. Many members of the tribe have been learning traditional forms and creating new variations.

===Birchbark canoes===
The birch bark canoe was at one time an important mode of transportation for all nations of the Wabanaki Confederacy. Each nation makes a characteristic shape of canoe. The vessels are each made from one piece of bark from a white birch tree. If done correctly, the large piece of bark can be removed without killing the tree.

==Spirituality ==
The Penobscot have a rich history of connection to the land and all of its bounties in Maine which is apparent in their folklore and reverence towards all things. Their rich spiritual cosmology informs their efforts of preserving land and natural resources in their sacred homeland. The landscapes of Maine are extremely valuable to the survival and beliefs of the Penobscot; their namesake river is personified, and most dear to them. Annette Kolodny describes &quot;how deeply rooted the Penobscot cosmology is within the Maine landscape; their ethic of mutual obligation to a land full of spirits, animal-people, and daunting power is fundamentally geographic, every place name helping to orient a traveler in relation to both physical space and spiritual power.&quot;

Their reverence is also based on their cosmology starting with their origin story where Klose-kur-beh (Gluskbe) is the central character. Klose-kur-beh provides the Penobscot with &quot;spiritual knowledge&quot; and &quot;practical knowledge (like how to construct a canoe)&quot; as well instilling their &quot;ethical precepts through&quot; twelve &#x27;episodes&#x27; which instill the importance of each unique value. Klose-kur-beh provides humans and animals with practical skills needed to thrive in the unforgiving climate of the North East and punishes those who operated outside of his code. Since Klose-kur-beh dates back to creation, according to Penobscot cosmology he was aware of other races and warned of the arrival of the white man, &quot;What makes the white man dangerous is the lethal combination of his greed (&#x27;he [. . .] wanted the whole earth&#x27;) and his lust for power (&#x27;he wants the power over all the earth&#x27;). That combination leads him to &#x27;reach forth his hand to grasp all things for his comfort&#x27; and, in the process, virtually destroy the world&quot;. This warning from such a prominent figurehead in Penobscot beliefs highlights that they upheld the values of preservation and protection of Maine&#x27;s land and ecological resources.

The French missionaries converted many Penobscot people to Christianity. In the 21st century, some members practice traditional spirituality; others on Indian Island are Catholic or Protestant.

== Nature ==
Through their folklore, the Penobscot are taught &quot;that the plants and animals were their helpers and companions, just as the people, in their turn, were to act as kin and companions to the living world around them... Such stories embed their listeners in a universe of mutually interacting and intimate reciprocal relationships.&quot; This starkly contrasts the European view which saw the land as something to be owned and commodified, highlighting the need for advocacy to improve and protect the culture and land of the Penobscot.

==Gambling==
In 1973 the nation opened Penobscot High Stakes Bingo on Indian Island. This was one of the first commercial gambling operations on a reservation in the United States. Bingo is open one weekend every six weeks. The Penobscot tribe has pushed for state legislation allowing them to add slot machines to their bingo hall, which has been granted.

==In popular culture==
The climax of the 1825 novel &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; by Maine native John Neal is set on Indian Island during the American Revolutionary War. The novel features a protagonist of mixed Penobscot-English descent and describes the island as &quot;the last encampment of the Penobscot Red men&quot;.

<text>The long-toed stint (Calidris subminuta) is a small wader. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific &quot;subminuta&quot; is from Latin &quot;sub&quot;, &quot;near to&quot; and &quot;minuta&quot;, &quot;small&quot; from its similarity to the little stint, &quot;Calidris minuta&quot;.

It breeds across northern Asia and is strongly migratory, wintering in south and south east Asia and Australasia. It occurs in western Europe only as a very rare vagrant.

This bird has yellowish legs and a short thin dark bill. Breeding adults are a rich brown with darker feather centres above and white underneath. They have a light line above the eye and a brown crown. In winter, long-toed stints are grey above. The juveniles are brightly patterned above with rufous colouration and white mantle stripes.

This bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny waders which are known collectively as &quot;peeps&quot; or &quot;stints&quot;. In particular, the long-toed stint is very similar to its North American counterpart, the least sandpiper. It differs from that species in its more slender, longer-necked appearance, longer toes, somewhat brighter colours, and weaker wingbar.

These birds forage on mudflats, picking up food by sight, sometimes by probing. They mainly eat small crustaceans, insects and snails. Little is known of the breeding habits of this species, although it nests on the ground, and the male has a display flight.

==Description==
The long-toed stint is a very small wader measuring just in length with a wingspan of . It weighs about . It has a small head and short, straight sharp-tipped beak. The neck is slender, the belly rounded and the long legs are set well back. The toes are long and slender, especially the middle one. The primary feathers extend as far as the tail. The crown is brown and there is a pale streak just above the eye. The upper parts are brown with the centres of the feathers darker brown. The breast is speckled with pale brown and the underparts are white. The legs and feet are yellow and the beak dark brown, apart from the base of the lower mandible which is yellow or pale brown.

This bird has a distinctive stance and its flight call distinguishes it from other sandpipers. On the ground it can be confused with the red-necked stint (&quot;Calidris ruficollis&quot;) but is more finely built and slightly smaller.

==Distribution and habitat==
The long-toed stint breeds in Siberia during the Northern Hemisphere summer. Little is known of its breeding habits but its breeding range includes the Chukchi Peninsula, the Koryak Plateau, the Commander Islands, the Kuril Islands, land bordering the Sea of Okhotsk, north Verkhoyansky District and around the Ob River and the Irtysh River. After the breeding season it migrates southwards passing through China, Indochina, Malaysia and the Philippines and westwards to Burma, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands. It is a visitor to New Guinea and Australia and a vagrant to Sweden, South Africa, Melanesia, Hawaii, the northwestern USA and the vicinity of the Bering Sea. In its over-wintering range it visits a variety of wetland habitats including shallow freshwater or brackish areas, lakes, swamps, floodplains, marshes, lagoons, muddy shores and sewage ponds.

==Behaviour==
The long-toed stint forages in wet habitats, probing the ground with its beak. It feeds on molluscs, crustaceans, amphibians, insects, other invertebrates and seeds. It roosts in hollows in soft mud or in low vegetation bordering its feeding area. In its breeding range in Russia its habitat is tundra, taiga, open grassy bogs or swamps. The nesting site tends to be in an area with mosses, sedges and dwarf willows and is typically a well-hidden, shallow depression on a mound of sedge or dried grass.

==Status==
The long-toed stint has a very wide range and it is estimated that there are somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000 individuals globally. There may be in the region of 25,000 breeding pairs. The population trend is unknown but the IUCN has listed the bird as being of least concern. No particular threats have been identified.

<text>A rice cooker or rice steamer is an automated kitchen appliance designed to boil or steam rice. It consists of a heat source, a cooking bowl, and a thermostat. The thermostat measures the temperature of the cooking bowl and controls the heat. Complex, high-tech rice cookers may have more sensors and other components, and may be multipurpose.

The term &quot;rice cooker&quot; formerly applied to non-automated dedicated rice-cooking utensils, which have an ancient history (a ceramic rice steamer dated to 1250 BC is on display in the British Museum). It now applies mostly to automated cookers. Electric rice cookers were developed in Japan, where they are known as &quot;&quot; (, literally, &quot;boil-rice-device&quot;).

==History==

The NJ-N1, developed by Mitsubishi Electric in 1923, was the first electric rice cooker, a direct ancestor of today&#x27;s automatic electric rice cookers. At that time, electricity was not widely used in ordinary households; it was for use on ships. It was a simple mechanism that heated with an attached heating coil without automation.

In the 1940s and early 1950s, Mitsubishi Electric, Matsushita Electric (now Panasonic), and Sony introduced electric rice cookers for home use with built-in heating coils, but they too were not automated and were not well received and sold poorly.

The ER-4, introduced by Toshiba on December 10, 1955 (or 1956), was the world&#x27;s first automatic electric rice cooker for home use. It was developed by Toshiba&#x27;s Shogo Yamada beginning in 1951 and completed in 1955 thanks to a breakthrough invention by Yoshitada Minami (ja), president of a Toshiba partner company. Research and development was a continuous process of trial and error. Research showed that rice cooks best when cooked at a temperature of for 20 minutes, so theoretically rice should cook well if an automatic timer is set to turn off the cooker 20 minutes after the water in the pot has boiled. However, the time it takes for the water to boil varies depending on the temperature, the amount of heat generated by the pot, and the amount of rice and water, so in the prototype stage, sometimes the rice was overcooked and burnt, while at other times it was undercooked and the rice was left with a core. The revolutionary idea to solve this problem was to use a double-layered structure for the pot. The mechanism involved filling the outer pot with a glass of water and heating it. After about 20 minutes, the water would evaporate and the temperature would rise rapidly, which the thermostat would detect and turn off.

The initial launch price was 3,200 yen, about one-third of the average college graduate&#x27;s starting monthly salary. At its launch, 700 units were produced, but they did not sell well.
The company then conducted sales promotions using the sales networks of electric power companies, held sales demonstrations, and sold an automatic timer that could turn on the rice cooker at any time, and the product&#x27;s popularity exploded. By 1960, four years after its introduction, the automatic electric rice cooker was in use in about half of all Japanese households.

The success of Toshiba&#x27;s automatic electric rice cookers sparked a &quot;manufacturing war&quot;, and Matsushita Electric entered the field as early as 1956 with the EC-36. The EC-36 was a cheaper product that used a single pot, reducing the amount of metal used and making it more competitive in terms of sales.

Later, the automatic electric rice cooker was well received in Asian countries and around the world under the name &quot;Automatic Rice Cooker&quot;. It also had a great impact on society, giving housewives more time and accelerating the women&#x27;s liberation movement. On the other hand, Helen Macnaughtan argued that the invention of the automatic electric rice cooker, which freed women from menial tasks in the kitchen and allowed some women to work part-time, was not a great victory for women&#x27;s liberation because it gave them more time to devote to other household tasks.

In 1972, a rice cooker with a heat-retention function was introduced, and in 1979, an electronic rice cooker equipped with a microcomputer that could also manage the soaking of rice after washing and the heat level. In 1988, rice cookers with electromagnetic induction heating were introduced, which provided higher heating.

==Principle of operation==


A basic rice cooker has a main body (pot), an inner cooking container which holds the rice, an electric heating element, and a thermostat.

The bowl is filled with rice and water and heated at full power; the water reaches and stays at boiling point (100 °C, 212 °F). When the water has all been absorbed, the temperature can rise above boiling point, which trips the thermostat. Some cookers switch to low-power &quot;warming&quot; mode, keeping the rice at a safe temperature of approximately 65 °C (150 °F); simpler models switch off; the rice has entered the resting phase.

More advanced cookers may use fuzzy logic for more detailed temperature control, induction rather than resistive heating, a steaming tray for other foods, and even the ability to rinse the rice.


=== Rice types and rice cookers ===

Brown rice generally needs longer cooking times than white rice, unless it is broken, or flourblasted (which perforates the bran).

Many models feature an ability to cook sticky rice or porridge as an added value. Most can be used as steamers. Some can be used as slow cookers. Some other models can bake bread or in some cases have an added function to maintain temperatures suitable for fermentation of bread dough or yogurt. Multi-purpose devices with rice cooking capability are not necessarily called &quot;rice cookers&quot;, but typically &quot;multi-cookers&quot;.

A rice cooker, or slow cooker, can be used in conjunction with a temperature probe and an external thermostat to cook food at a stable low temperature (&quot;sous-vide&quot;).

==Other uses==
Steam rice cookers have been shown to be effective for decontamination of face masks.

<doc id="375314" wikidata="Q5333268" url="?curid=375314" title="Ecological yield">
<text>Ecological yield is the harvestable population growth of an ecosystem. It is most commonly measured in forestry: sustainable forestry is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year, within a given patch of forest.

However, the concept is also applicable to water, soil, and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed—called renewable resources. The carrying capacity of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is &quot;renewed&quot; (refreshed or regrown or rebuilt) is consumed.

Ecosystem services analysis calculates the global yield of the Earth&#x27;s biosphere to humans as a whole. This is said to be greater in size than the entire human economy. However, it is more than just yield, but also the natural processes that increase biodiversity and conserve habitat which result in the total value of these services. &quot;Yield&quot; of ecological commodities like wood or water, useful to humans, is only a part of it.

Very often an ecological yield in one place offsets an ecological load in another. Greenhouse gas released in one place, for instance, is fairly evenly distributed in the atmosphere, and so greenhouse gas control can be achieved by creating a carbon sink literally anywhere else.

== History ==
Some of the earliest academic papers on the subject were researching methods of sustainable fishing. Work of Russel et al. in 1931 observed in particular that ”it appears that the ideal of a stabilised fishery yielding a constant maximum value is impractical.” This work was mostly theoretical. Practical work would begin later, performed by industry and government agencies.

== Motivation ==
Ecological yield is a theoretical construct which aggregates information from several physically measurable quantities. It can be used to reason about other ecological indicators such as the footprint. It can also be used as a decision-making tool for governments and corporations.

=== Ecological footprint ===
The idea of ecological footprints is to measure the cost of economic activity in terms of the amount of ecologically productive land required to sustain it. Doing this accurately requires estimating how productive the land is; in other words, it requires measuring ecological yield. Conversely, one can extract ecological yield estimates from ecological footprint estimates.

=== Avoiding overexploitation ===
Corporations take out loans to buy equipment and land use rights. In order to pay back these loans, they must extract and sell resources from the land. If the corporation is ignorant of the yield of the land in question, then the debt instruments may demand a yield greater than the ecological capacity to renew. Green economics links this process with ecocide and poses solutions through monetary reform.

Even well-meaning corporations may systematically overestimate the yield of an ecosystem. In the case of multiple corporations bidding for land rights, an economic phenomenon known as the winner&#x27;s curse causes the winning party to systematically overestimate the economic value of the land. Typically the economic value comes mostly from the ecological yield, in which case the corporation will overestimate that as well.

Another form of overestimation may come from generalizing data from other ecosystems. For example, the same species of fish in two different systems may have significantly different diets. If its diet in one region consists mostly of algae but in another region consists largely of smaller fish, then it will be more expensive for the latter ecosystem to produce the fish. Yield will be correspondingly lower in the second region. This example illustrates the need for ecosystem-specific study and monitoring in order to reason about ecological yield.

== Definition and properties ==
One may define yearly ecological yield for a fixed ecological product as follows: the yield is the amount of the product which may be removed from the ecosystem so that it is capable of recovering in one year. As a theoretical property of ecosystems, it cannot be measured directly but only estimated. Note that definition is sensitive to the time period which is allowed for recovery: the amount of product one can remove which regenerates over 3 years is not necessarily 3 times that which one can remove and regenerate over 1 year. The yearly ecological yield is most useful because of the cycle of seasons and the commercial notion of the fiscal year. The seasons affect growth through temperature, sunlight, and rain, especially at the lowest trophic level. The fiscal year affects decisions by corporations to harvest resources: they may choose to harvest at or above ideal levels based on their need for short-term cash flow.

== Calculation techniques ==

=== Yield of the whole biosphere ===
In 1986, Vitousek et al. estimated that humans made use of 50 petagrams (50 billion tons) per year of biomass produced from photosynthesis. They also estimated that these 50 billion tons comprised between 20% and 40% of photosynthetic activity on earth. Separately, the Global Footprint Network estimates the total human footprint as 1.6 times the total biosphere. This implies that ecosystems are overexploited by a factor of 1.6 on average.

=== Theoretical prediction ===
In most biomes, the only form of primary production is photosynthesis. In other words, all new biomass can be traced back to photosynthetic plants and algae by a chain of predation. Therefore, one can predict the yield of one organism in an ecosystem as a function of the yield of its primary producers. When the biomass from prey is converted into biomass in its predator, some losses occur due to biological and thermodynamic inefficiency. The conversion rate is typically about 10%. In other words, 100 kg of plant matter may be converted into 10 kg of herbivores, which then may be converted to 1 kg of carnivores who exclusively eat herbivores. One can compute the trophic level of an organism as the weighted average of length of the predation chain from the organism to a primary producer. This trophic level determines an exponential multiplier to convert from primary producer biomass to the organism&#x27;s biomass.

== Measurement techniques ==

=== Measuring forests ===
One can measure the amount of wood removed from a forest by asking the company who removed it; typically only one company has the logging rights to any given plot of land. In order to measure the regrowth of the forest in the coming year, typically one picks a representative subsample of the region and tracks every single tree in the subsample.

One such study measured growth in a section of the Tapajós National Forest for 13 years after logging activity. The loggers intended to harvest on a 30-year cycle. Logging in this region is restricted to mature trees measuring at least 45 cm DBH. Before logging, the region had somewhere between 150 m³ and 200 m³ of mature tree volume per hectare. Loggers removed about 75 m³ of tree per hectare, between 40% and 50% of the standing mass.

The authors show that growth rates in the region were elevated for up to 3 years after logging. After 13 years of growth, the basal area reached 75% of its original volume. They also show that logging makes substantial changes to the species composition and canopy structure of the forest. This introduces subjectivity into the notion of &quot;recovery&quot; for an ecosystem.

<doc id="375316" wikidata="Q872541" url="?curid=375316" title="Groton School">
<text>Groton School is a private, college-preparatory, day and boarding school located in Groton, Massachusetts, United States. It is affiliated with the Episcopal tradition.

Groton enrolls about 380 boys and girls from the eighth through twelfth grades, dubbed Forms II–VI in the British fashion. Its $475 million endowment enables the school to admit students on a need-blind basis. Typically, 40–44% of students are on financial aid. Students with family incomes under $150,000 attend for free.

The school admitted 8% of applicants in 2022. Its list of notable alumni includes U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Nobel laureate John B. Goodenough.

==History==

=== The Peabody era, 1884–1940 ===
Groton School was founded in 1884 by Endicott Peabody, an Episcopal priest. Peabody was backed by Harvard president Charles Eliot and affluent figures of the time, such as Peabody&#x27;s father Samuel Peabody, Phillips Brooks, William Lawrence, William Crowninshield Endicott, and J. P. Morgan. The school also enjoyed the patronage of the Roosevelt family, as Theodore Roosevelt was one of Peabody&#x27;s close friends.

Peabody served as headmaster for fifty-six years. A proponent of &quot;muscular Christianity,&quot; he instituted a Spartan educational system that included cold showers and dormitory cubicles instead of individual bedrooms. He successfully attracted the children of wealthy families, whom he hoped to toughen up through this program of &quot;corrective salutary deprivation.&quot;

Under Peabody, Groton sought to inspire its students to serve the public good, rather than enter professional life. In peacetime, many graduates were involved in public affairs, but the alumni typically gravitated to business, finance, law, or similar professional positions. In wartime, the school&#x27;s ethos of public service played a more prominent role. 475 of Groton&#x27;s 580 military-age alumni served in World War I; 24 died and another 36 were wounded, at a time when the graduating class contained roughly 27 students. Roughly 700 alumni served in World War II, with 31 deaths.

Peabody also expected his students to &quot;be ready for advanced courses at the universities.&quot; He sought to improve the academic qualities of the student body, introducing competitive entrance examinations and a scholarship program in 1907. (One such scholarship student, Henry Chauncey &#x27;23, went on to popularize the Scholastic Aptitude Test with American universities.) Since even Ivy League universities could not always be counted on for financial aid at the time, Peabody also helped certain students pay for college. Chauncey was able to transfer from Ohio State to Harvard after Peabody arranged for a Groton donor to subsidize the cost, and Peabody gave the 1940 valedictorian John B. Goodenough a tutoring job to help make ends meet after the latter was admitted to Yale.

=== The Crocker era, 1940–65 ===
Peabody was succeeded by John Crocker &#x27;18, the Episcopal chaplain at Princeton University. Crocker&#x27;s 25-year tenure overlapped with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement. In September 1951, Groton accepted its first African-American student. In April 1965, Crocker and his wife—accompanied by 85 Groton students—marched with Martin Luther King Jr. during a civil rights demonstration in Boston. (Four years earlier, Southern authorities had arrested Crocker&#x27;s son John Jr. &#x27;42 during the Freedom Rides, leading to the Supreme Court case &quot;Pierson v. Ray&quot;.) Crocker also significantly expanded the school&#x27;s financial aid program; by his retirement in 1965 approximately 30% of Groton students were on scholarship.

=== Co-education and change, 1965–77 ===
After Crocker, Groton cycled through three brief Headmasterships: Bertrand Honea Jr. (1965–69), Paul Wright (1969–74), and Rowland Cox (1974–77). These years were marked by disputes over how (if at all) to implement co-education at Groton. Honea proposed either merging with a girls&#x27; school or formalizing a sister-school relationship with Concord Academy, a well-regarded girls&#x27; school twenty miles away. (Concord declined Groton&#x27;s offer to help relocate the academy to the town of Groton, and mooted the issue by opening its doors to boys in 1971.) Following Honea&#x27;s departure, Wright successfully proposed an organic transition to co-education by expanding the student body from 225 to 300 students; this plan limited the number of boys that would be rejected under the new system. After Wright reached Groton&#x27;s mandatory retirement age, the school tapped Cox to implement the plan. Groton welcomed its first female students in 1975. Applications tripled, and today, Groton&#x27;s student body is evenly split between boys and girls.

The new headmasters also relaxed some of the more Spartan aspects of Peabody&#x27;s Groton in response to changing preferences within the American upper class, which increasingly favored private day schools over boarding schools. They replaced the sleeping cubicles with proper bedrooms, added more holidays to the academic calendar, relaxed the dress code, authorized a school newspaper, and gave students more free time over the weekends to explore the town of Groton or their own personal interests. However, some traditions remain, such as the school&#x27;s commitment to public service, its small community, and its attachment to the Episcopal Church.

=== Contemporary Groton, 1977–present ===
Groton reached its modern form under William Polk &#x27;58 (1978–2003) and Richard Commons (2003–13), who significantly upgraded the campus&#x27; buildings and grounds and internationalized the admissions process; and the current Headmaster, the South African Temba Maqubela (2013–present). In recent years the school has focused on broadening affordability. In 2008, Groton, Andover, and Exeter began offering free tuition to families with household incomes below a certain threshold, initially set at $75,000. From 2014 to 2018, the school conducted a $74 million fundraising campaign that allowed it to begin admitting students on a need-blind basis.

In the spring of 1999, the Middlesex County District Attorney began investigating the claims of three Groton seniors, who alleged that they, and other students, had been sexually abused by other students in dormitories in 1996 and 1997. During the school&#x27;s investigation of the matter, another student brought a similar complaint to the school&#x27;s attention. In 2005, the school pleaded guilty to a criminal misdemeanor charge of failing to report the latter student&#x27;s sexual abuse complaint to the government and paid a $1,250 fine. The school issued an apology to the victims, and the civil suit stemming from the first student&#x27;s complaint was settled out of court. In the fall of 2006, as part of the settlement, the school published a full apology to the boy who first alleged the abuse in 1999.

Members of the Groton community continue to play a notable role in the secondary school community. At present, former Groton masters are the heads of school at Cranbrook (Aimeclaire Roche, also president of the national Heads and Principals Association), St. Paul&#x27;s (Kathleen Giles), Roxbury Latin (Sam Schaffer), Dana Hall (Katherine Bradley), Salisbury (William Webb), and Brewster International (Craig Gemmell), among others.

== Academics and reputation ==
In 2024, &quot;Niche&quot; ranked Groton as America&#x27;s top private high school. However, a small school like Groton is particularly vulnerable to short-term fluctuations in the &quot;Niche&quot; ranking formula; in 2020 the school was ranked #33. The school&#x27;s small size also helps it record low admission rates. In 2016, &quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked Groton as the most selective boarding school in the United States. In 2024, the website Private School Review repeated this ranking, although it did not say whether it confirmed this information with Groton.

=== Curriculum and test scores ===
The Form of 2023&#x27;s average combined SAT score was 1490 and its average combined ACT score was 33.5. The school&#x27;s 4:1 student-teacher ratio allows the school to offer a variety of courses and an individualized study program for seniors whose academic interests have gone beyond the regular curriculum. Although not every academic department offers Advanced Placement classes, Groton students took 2,582 AP exams (approximately 6.5 per student) from 2018 to 2022 and passed 93% of them.

=== Role as feeder school ===
Groton has historically served as a feeder school for Harvard College. From 1906 to 1932, 405 Groton students applied to Harvard and 402 were accepted.

There were at least three major reasons for this level of success. First, even Ivy League schools accepted most of their applicants until the second half of the twentieth century, when the government expanded the pool of students who could afford college by backing student loans (Higher Education Act of 1965) and providing G.I. Bill funding for veterans. (Stanford, which accepted seven of every eight applicants in 1951, was rejecting four of every five by 1965.) Second, Groton students often performed well on college entrance examinations. From 1906 to 1934, only six students received perfect scores on the English component of the College Boards (the predecessor to the SAT), and four were Groton alumni. Third, even when Groton produced middling students, elite colleges were often willing to admit them anyway because of their parents&#x27; legacy status, wealth, or connections. One especially rich Groton boy did so poorly in school that Endicott Peabody threatened to ban him from applying to Harvard. Despite &quot;appalling&quot; scores on his entrance exams, Harvard admitted him anyway. (In those days, a student did not actually have to pass his entrance exams to be admitted.)

In 1953, McGeorge Bundy &#x27;36 became the faculty dean at Harvard, a role which gave him oversight of undergraduate admissions. Although he became a Groton trustee in 1957, he believed that the college entrance exams of the time were doing a poor job of identifying the most talented students, and concluded that &quot;[t]he untrained boy of real brilliance is more valuable to [Harvard] than the dull boy who has been intensely trained.&quot; In 1958, Bundy commissioned a report urging Harvard to diversify its student body and to give greater weight to raw academic talent in undergraduate admissions. The share of prep school graduates at Harvard declined from 57% of the freshman class in 1941 to 32% in 1980. These changes were not confined to Harvard. In 1960, Groton&#x27;s 75th anniversary book accurately warned that prep school students were now &quot;challenged ... by boys who come from public schools all over the country. As one [Yale] dean said to me, &#x27;There has been a dramatic rise in the academic competence of Yale&#x27;s students during the last few years. The best of the present are no better than the best of previous years; there are simply more of them.&#x27;&quot;

From 2019 to 2023, the ten most common destinations for Groton graduates (in order) were University of Chicago, Georgetown University, Yale University, Harvard University, Boston College, Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, Brown University, and Columbia University.

=== Related educational institutions ===
Groton has contributed to several other educational institutions.

In 1909, Bishop Charles Henry Brent founded Baguio School (now Brent International School Baguio) in Baguio, Philippines to educate the children of American colonial administrators, military personnel, missionaries, and businesspeople. The school&#x27;s first headmaster was Remsen B. Ogilby, a former Groton teacher, and Peabody lent the school Guy Ayrault, who became its first assistant headmaster. Peabody&#x27;s son Malcolm &#x27;07 ran the school from 1911 to 1913. The school sought to be a &quot;determinedly American institution&quot; in Southeast Asia until the Philippines gained their independence in 1946.

In 1926, Peabody founded Brooks School in North Andover, Massachusetts. Groton was heavily oversubscribed, and the introduction of competitive examinations in 1907 had not meaningfully trimmed the waitlist. Peabody did not want to increase the size of the school (which never exceeded 194 students during his tenure), but also did not want to turn away too many parents. Accordingly, he raised over $200,000 from Groton donors to build a new school, which, like Groton, would be Episcopal and small enough to be familial. Brooks sought to replicate Groton&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;stern Christian principles ... to train boys for life,&quot; but avoided the &quot;character-building cold showers that had been a dreaded prebreakfast ritual at Groton.&quot;

Groton currently supports Epiphany School, an academically intensive, tuition-free, lottery-admission Episcopal middle school for at-risk youth in the Boston area. The school was founded by John Finley &#x27;88, and Groton headmaster William Polk previously served on Epiphany&#x27;s board. Epiphany&#x27;s academic year is 11 months long, and the entire school relocates to Groton&#x27;s campus in the summer.

==Admissions and student body==
=== Admission policies ===
Groton&#x27;s acceptance rate normally hovers around 12%. Applications increased by 20% during the COVID-19 pandemic, driving the acceptance rate down to 9% in 2021 and 8% in 2022. Since then, the school has not published its acceptance rate.

Groton admits students on a need-blind basis. Before adopting need-blind admissions, full-pay applicants had an advantage in the application process; in 2012, the last year the school reported these statistics, 25–30% of full-pay applicants were admitted compared to 10–20% of financial aid applicants. In 2018, the school announced that its admission rate was the same for both financial aid applicants and full-pay applicants.

At the start of the 2018–19 school year, 18 of Groton&#x27;s 96 incoming students were siblings of current students, and another 5 were children of school employees.

=== Grade levels ===
At Groton, grades are known as Forms, a term used in the United Kingdom and adopted by Endicott Peabody from his time at Cheltenham College. In 1967, the last class of seventh graders (in school jargon, &quot;First Formers&quot;) was admitted. In the 2022–23 school year, Groton enrolled 26 eighth graders (&quot;Second Formers&quot;), 81 freshmen (&quot;Third Formers&quot;), 87 sophomores (&quot;Fourth Formers&quot;), 92 juniors (&quot;Fifth Formers&quot;), and 91 seniors (&quot;Sixth Formers&quot;), for a total enrollment of 377 students.

=== Student body ===
When Groton was founded in 1884, American boarding schools primarily catered to White Anglo-Saxon Protestants. St. Paul&#x27;s accepted only students with &quot;sound Episcopal credentials,&quot; and in 1885 Andover admitted a Jew &quot;[f]or the first time in twelve years.&quot; Although Groton was open to Jews and non-Episcopalian Christians (for example, the Presbyterian Theodore Roosevelt and the Jewish Otto Kahn both sent their sons to Groton), the results were not substantially different.

In Groton&#x27;s early years, most of its students came from wealthy families in New York; some others came from New England. A 1902 graduate recognized that &quot;[n]inety-five percent of these boys came from what they considered the aristocracy of America. Their fathers belonged to the Somerset, the Knickerbocker, the Philadelphia or the Baltimore Clubs. Among them was a goodly slice of the wealth of the nation.&quot; Accordingly, schools like Groton considered it their mission &quot;to make virtuous and brave those who, through the accident of birth, would someday exercise great power and influence.&quot;

In the 2023–24 school year, 46% of Groton students identified as students of color, and 15% commuted to school from towns and cities in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. In addition, 7% of the student body were international students; they came from 25 countries.

== Finances ==

=== Tuition and financial aid ===
In the 2023–24 school year, Groton charged boarding students $59,995 and day students $46,720, plus other optional and mandatory fees. Typically, 40–44% of students are on financial aid, which covers, on average, $46,519 for boarding students and $32,371 for day students. Since 2008, Groton has guaranteed free tuition for families with incomes under a certain threshold. In 2024, the school raised the threshold from $80,000 to $150,000. All financial aid is distributed as grants (i.e., nothing needs to be paid back); the school discontinued student loans in 2007.

In 2014, Groton adopted a policy of restricting frontline tuition below that of its competitors. In 2022, it was the least expensive school among a sample of 40 peer boarding schools. However, after financial aid is taken into consideration, other boarding schools may still offer competitive tuition packages once a student is admitted. For example, at Lawrenceville, boarding tuition for 2023–24 was $76,080 (roughly $16,000 more than Groton), but the average aid grant for boarding students that year was around $60,000 (roughly $13,000 more than Groton). Conversely, at Roxbury Latin, an all-boys day school with a similar frontline tuition policy, tuition for 2024–25 was $40,600 ($6,820 less than Groton) while the average aid grant was $27,348 ($8,811 less than Groton).

=== Endowment and expenses ===
Groton&#x27;s financial endowment stands at $475 million. In its Internal Revenue Service filings for the 2021–22 school year, Groton reported total assets of $623.4 million, net assets of $537.3 million, investment holdings of $471.1 million, and cash holdings of $3.1 million. Groton also reported $37.8 million in program service expenses and $7.8 million in grants (primarily student financial aid).

== Governance ==

=== Organization ===
Groton is an independent (private) school accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. The school was initially organized as a charitable trust. In 1893, the Massachusetts legislature passed an act reorganizing the school into a non-profit corporation governed by a board of trustees. The Articles of Incorporation have been amended only twice since 1893: to enable girls to attend Groton, and to change the name of the legal entity from Trustees of Groton School to (simply) Groton School.

=== External affiliations ===
Groton does not participate in either the Eight Schools Association or the Ten Schools Admissions Organization. Outside of athletics, Groton has collaborated with other independent schools on a primarily &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis. For example, after the Kent State shootings, Groton, St. Paul&#x27;s, Andover, and Exeter held an emergency meeting to discuss how boarding schools should respond to growing student unrest. Groton also worked with St. Paul&#x27;s, Andover, Deerfield, and Hotchkiss to create the Gateway to Prep Schools application portal. The current headmaster, Temba Maqubela, sits on the board of the Heads and Principals Association.

=== Funding ===
As an independent school, Groton is not dependent on public funding. However, private schools are still eligible for government grants and indirect assistance. The Massachusetts Development Finance Agency has issued tax-exempt bonds to finance renovations and/or new buildings at Groton, Andover, Deerfield, St. Mark&#x27;s, and Nobles. The schools are still required to pay back the bonds on their own, but obtain tax benefits and more attractive repayment terms by working with the government.

==Campus==
Groton has a 480-acre campus, including academic buildings, dormitories, athletic fields, and undeveloped land for conservation. The campus layout and landscape was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed Central Park in New York City and many other educational institutions. The school&#x27;s core buildings are arranged around a (mostly) circular lawn, and &quot;The Circle&quot; is the primary metonym for Groton&#x27;s campus. In 2018, &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; named Groton the most beautiful private high school campus in Massachusetts.

The earliest surviving buildings on campus surround the Circle. Most of them were designed by Peabody &amp; Stearns between 1884 and 1902. These buildings include the Brooks House dormitory (1884), the Fives Court (1890), the Hundred House dormitory (1891), the Schoolhouse (1899), and the old gymnasium (1902), the latter of which is now the dining hall. The present Chapel was consecrated in 1900.

Other architects who worked at Groton include Graham Gund (Campbell Performing Arts Center), R. Clipston Sturgis (Sturgis House and Gardner House), McKim, Mead &amp; White (Norton House), and Henry Forbes Bigelow (Cutting House). More recently, the school built a solar battery farm and a net-zero emissions faculty residence to improve energy efficiency on campus.

The school&#x27;s athletic facilities include the Athletic Center (which contains two hockey rinks, three basketball courts, twelve squash courts, and a swimming pool), a crew boathouse on the Nashua River, a track and field complex, and 18 tennis courts.

== Spiritual life ==

=== Chapel program ===

St. John&#x27;s Chapel opened in 1900. It was the gift of William Amory Gardner, one of the school&#x27;s original teachers. It was designed by Henry Vaughan, who also designed Washington National Cathedral and the New Chapel at St. Paul&#x27;s School. The Chapel replaced an earlier Vaughan design (now the Sacred Heart Church of Groton), which the school donated to the local Catholic community.

The Chapel&#x27;s large size reflects the school&#x27;s dual role as high school and parish church (cf. Christ Church, Oxford). Local landowners James and Prescott Lawrence donated the land for the campus on the understanding that the school would serve as the town&#x27;s parish church, as there was no Episcopal church in Groton. In 1950, the school&#x27;s pastoral responsibilities were transferred to its satellite church in Ayer.

The Chapel&#x27;s Aeolian-Skinner pipe organ (b. 1935) was designed by G. Donald Harrison, and was one of the first American organs designed to play Baroque music. Over the next few decades, Harrison used the organ as a &quot;laboratory&quot; for the American Classic organ style.

Since 1929, the school has hosted an annual Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, based on the version at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

=== Episcopal heritage and ecumenicism ===
At Groton, students are required to attend five religious services a week: four ecumenical services on weekday mornings (comparable to morning assembly at a non-religious school) and one sectarian service of the student&#x27;s choice on weekends. According to Catholic commentator William F. Buckley Jr., when a prospective Catholic parent asked Groton whether it would encourage his son to attend Sunday Mass, the school replied, &quot;No, he won&#x27;t be encouraged to. He&#x27;ll be required to.&quot;

The school&#x27;s Protestant liturgy and architecture reflect Endicott Peabody&#x27;s low church tendencies. To this day, the Chapel does not have any pews for students except in the choir. One scholar has suggested that the relative lack of ritual at Sunday services helped attract non-Episcopalian students to the school. School chaplain Allison Read sits on the board of the National Association of Episcopal Schools.

The school&#x27;s continued adherence to religious services on weekends has made it somewhat of an anomaly among Eastern boarding schools. In the 1990s, the aforementioned Buckley surveyed twelve American boarding schools and reported that Groton, Kent, and St. George&#x27;s were the only schools in the study that required students to attend a sectarian religious service on the weekend. Since then, Kent has dropped its requirement, and St. George&#x27;s moved its mandatory service to Thursdays. However, students have found ways to accommodate their own preferences. In 2018, a student wrote in the school newspaper that the Buddhist service (which allows students to use smartphones) has become a popular &quot;catch-all for non-religious students.&quot;

=== Motto ===
Groton adopted its current motto, &quot;cui servire est regnare&quot;, in 1902. Its proper English translation has been debated over the years. The Anglican Communion still uses Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s translation &quot;in whose [God&#x27;s] service is perfect freedom&quot; from the original Anglican Book of Common Prayer. However, other sources, including the Catholic Church (&quot;Lumen gentium&quot;), have used the more straightforward translation &quot;to serve [God] is to reign.&quot; The school acknowledges the validity of both translations.

The phrase &quot;cui servire est regnare&quot; was originally attributed to Saint Augustine, and has been used in Christian liturgies since the 8th century at the latest (Gelasian Sacramentary). The school adopted the motto after guest speaker Arthur C. A. Hall, the bishop of Vermont, used the term in a sermon on campus.

== Athletics ==
Groton&#x27;s sports teams compete in the Independent School League (ISL), a group of boarding and day schools in Greater Boston. ISL schools may only award financial aid based on a family&#x27;s ability to pay; as such, they do not offer athletic scholarships. In addition, ISL schools may not recruit post-graduate students, unlike the Founders League.

=== Sports ===
Groton offers 47 teams in 22 interscholastic programs.
Fall athletic offerings
* Cross country
* Field hockey (girls)
* Football (boys)

* Baseball (boys)
* Rowing
* Lacrosse
* Tennis
* Track and field

The Groton football team has produced three national championship-winning college football coaches, including four-time champion Percy Haughton, and four members of the College Football Hall of Fame. In 1905, when several colleges (including Stanford, California, Northwestern, and Duke) dropped football citing player safety, Endicott Peabody persuaded Theodore Roosevelt to push the remaining colleges to make the game safer by reforming the rules of football; this resulted in the legalization of the forward pass, the rule requiring 10 yards for a first down, and the creation of the neutral zone. The Groton football team won the ISL championship in 1997. Caleb Coleman &#x27;20, Robert Long &#x27;21, and Wilson Thors &#x27;21 are currently playing college football.
The Groton boys&#x27; crew has won nine New England championships and has produced five Olympic gold medalists (Frederick Sheffield &#x27;20, Howard T. &quot;Ox&quot; Kingsbury &#x27;22, Donald Beer &#x27;53, Charles Grimes &#x27;53, and Emory Clark &#x27;56) one Olympic silver medalist (Seymour &quot;Sy&quot; Cromwell &#x27;52), one Olympic bronze medalist (Ted Patton &#x27;84) and thirteen Olympic rowers overall (James Lawrence, Jr &#x27;25, Lawrence Terry &#x27;18, John Parker &#x27;85, Henry Nuzum &#x27;95, Liane Malcos &#x27;96 and Alex Karwoski &#x27;08). The younger Groton girls&#x27; crew has won four New England championships and has produced world champion Liane Malcos &#x27;96. Both teams send crews to the Henley Royal Regatta and Henley Women&#x27;s Regatta with some regularity.

The Groton girls&#x27; tennis team won the ISL championship in 2023 and 2024. The Groton boys&#x27; tennis team won the ISL championship in 2018 and 2022. Both the Groton girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; squash teams won the 2020 U.S. high school team division three national championship.

Groton alumni have produced two International Six Metre class Sailing Olympic gold medalists (James Hopkins Smith Jr. &#x27;27, John Adams Morgan &#x27;49).

=== Rivalry (or rivalries) ===
Groton&#x27;s sports rival is St. Mark&#x27;s School. The two schools began playing in 1886 and contest the fifth-oldest high school football rivalry in the United States. The rivalry began when St. Mark&#x27;s rejected Endicott Peabody for its vacant headmaster job on the basis that the school bylaws required the headmaster to be an Episcopal priest and Peabody had not yet been ordained, only to turn around and hire a different layperson for the position. It took on a friendlier tone when St. Mark&#x27;s hired Peabody&#x27;s deputy William Greenough Thayer as its new headmaster.

Groton&#x27;s crews have rowed against Noble and Greenough School since 1922. This rivalry developed because historically, Groton and St. Mark&#x27;s only played each other in football, baseball, and fives, although the schools now play in all sports.

Groton and St. Paul&#x27;s School play each other in all sports and compete for a trophy. Groton also plays its neighbor Lawrence Academy in various sports, but because the ISL is split into different divisions for football and hockey, matchups are less frequent.

== In popular culture ==
* The school has inspired (to some extent) several novels, such as the boarding schools Justin Martyr in Louis Auchincloss &#x27;35&#x27;s &quot;The Rector of Justin&quot; and Ault School in Curtis Sittenfeld &#x27;93&#x27;s &quot;Prep&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; has also speculated that Whooton School in J.D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; may have been based on Groton.
* During Franklin Delano Roosevelt &#x27;00&#x27;s presidential administration, which popularized the use of radio broadcasts in politics, Roosevelt&#x27;s distinctive Northeastern elite accent (sometimes described as a transatlantic accent) led various writers to hypothesize the existence of a &quot;Groton accent&quot; or &quot;Groton voice,&quot; including F. Scott Fitzgerald (&quot;Tender is the Night&quot;). The accent was soon linked to other Groton alumni, including Dean Acheson &#x27;12 and Averell Harriman &#x27;09. Some modern-day writers continue to use the term, but other researchers, including William Safire, have suggested that this form of &quot;boarding school lockjaw&quot; was taught by a wider range of Northeastern prep schools.
* Groton was a minor filming location for Alexander Payne&#x27;s 2023 film &quot;The Holdovers&quot;, standing in for the fictional Barton Academy. The production team shot footage in the chapel (although most of the chapel scenes were shot at Northfield Mount Hermon) and outside Groton&#x27;s boathouse on the Nashua River. As shown in the film, the west wall of the chapel has a large stained-glass window dedicated to the Groton alumni who died in World War I.
* In the TV show &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry) has a picture of Endicott Peabody from his time at Groton. Both characters Logan and Christopher Hayden (David Sutcliffe) claim to have been kicked out of Groton.
* In Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s play &quot;Third&quot;, a college professor is assigned to teach a Groton alumnus who, despite his WASPy name, cannot afford college tuition without an athletic scholarship.
* In Robert Littell&#x27;s novel &quot;The Company&quot;, several CIA officers are alumni of Groton, including the main character&#x27;s (fictional) son and his (non-fictional) boss Richard Bissell.
* The school has been parodied in several &quot;New Yorker&quot; cartoons.

<text>Ed is an American comedy drama television series that was co-produced by David Letterman&#x27;s Worldwide Pants Incorporated, NBC Productions and Viacom Productions that aired on NBC from October 8, 2000, to February 6, 2004. The hour-long comedy drama starred Tom Cavanagh as the title character Ed Stevens, Julie Bowen as his love interest Carol Vessey, Josh Randall as his best friend Dr. Mike Burton, Jana Marie Hupp as Mike&#x27;s wife Nancy, Lesley Boone as their friend Molly Hudson, and Justin Long as awkward high-school student Warren Cheswick. Other supporting cast members included Michael Genadry and Ginnifer Goodwin as Warren&#x27;s friends Mark and Diane, and Michael Ian Black, Mike Starr, Rachel Cronin, and (later) Daryl Mitchell as the employees of Ed&#x27;s bowling alley. Long term guest stars included John Slattery as Dennis Martino and Sabrina Lloyd as Frankie Hector. The show was created by executive producers Jon Beckerman and Rob Burnett. David Letterman is also credited as one of the show&#x27;s executive producers.

&quot;Ed&quot; received casting, writing, and directing Primetime Emmy Award nominations in 2001. Tom Cavanagh received a Golden Globe Award nomination and a &quot;TV Guide&quot; Award for his work on the program.

==Premise==
The show revolves around Ed Stevens, a hotshot New York lawyer who, on the same day he is fired from his job (for drafting a contract with a misplaced comma that ended up costing his firm $1.6 million), comes home to discover his wife having an affair with a mailman that she claims she met at Starbucks. Dejected, Ed decides to return to his hometown, which is the fictional town of Stuckeyville, Ohio, to spend some time. Upon his arrival, he is reunited with friends that he has missed, as well as Carol Vessey, his high school crush. Determined to win her heart, Ed decides to stay, buying a rundown bowling alley and setting up a new law firm in the process, earning him the undesired nickname &quot;The Bowling Alley Lawyer&quot; which leads him to make a distinction to a judge during one of his first trials: &quot;I am a lawyer, I own a bowling alley. Two separate things.&quot;

&quot;Ed&quot; has a number of running gags, such as bowling alley employee Phil (Michael Ian Black) hatching ludicrous schemes usually to gain fame and fortune, ten-dollar bets between Ed and his best friend, Mike, that would require one of them to do something extremely embarrassing, mentions of Arbor Day as a big holiday, and various characters named &quot;Godfrey&quot; appearing in many episodes. The series also deals with issues of social popularity and self-esteem both through Ed—who was unpopular in high school and yet had a crush on stereotypically popular blond cheerleader Carol Vessey—and through Molly, Carol&#x27;s coworker and friend who was similarly unpopular in high school and continues to have self-esteem issues due to her being overweight.

A lawyer who worked for a prestigious law firm in New York City, he loses his job for drafting a contract with a misplaced comma, and on the same day catches his wife having an affair with a mailman. He returns to his home town of Stuckeyville where he reconnects with old friends, buys the old Stuckeybowl Bowling Alley, and opens a legal practice inside of an office in the bowling alley. Phil comes up with the idea to combine Ed&#x27;s legal knowledge with bowling and Ed comes to represent many of the townspeople in court. He attempts to win Carol Vessey for four years, and while she is in love with him, she cannot believe good men like Ed exist. Ed is a compassionate and caring man and often takes cases where he represents the underdogs, while he sometimes finds himself working for people he disagrees with he still treats all of his clients with fairness. He also believes that the law, common sense, and moderation need not be mutually exclusive.
* Julie Bowen as Carol Phyllis Vessey. The object of Ed&#x27;s affection, she has stayed in Stuckeyville most of her life as she teaches English at Stuckeyville High and is also an aspiring writer. She is seen dating a long-term boyfriend, a fellow English teacher Nick Stanton, but she breaks up with him shortly after Ed returns. Later, she starts to develop feelings for Ed until an old flame from Ed&#x27;s life comes back to Stuckeyville. Carol was a beautiful and popular cheerleader in high school, and Ed has had feelings for her since he first saw her in freshman Biology. She almost marries Stuckeyville High&#x27;s new principal Dennis Martino (John Slattery), but she is left at the altar as Dennis realizes that she is in love with Ed. Later in the series she comes to understand that she does truly love Ed and that Ed truly loves her. Ed and Carol marry in the series finale.
* Jana Marie Hupp as Nancy Burton. Mike&#x27;s wife and a good friend of Ed and Carol&#x27;s, she is originally a working mother in marketing, then later becomes a substitute teacher at Stuckeyville High, and then finally a guidance counselor where she is well liked by the Students at Stuckeyville. She is often seen as having a sense of moderation and wisdom for everyone in the series, often rolling her eyes at Mike&#x27;s and Ed&#x27;s antics, but she is a good friend to Ed and a loving, loyal and supportive wife to her husband.
* Josh Randall as Dr. Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Burton. He is Ed&#x27;s best friend and has been since their high school days.

* Lesley Boone as Molly Hudson. Carol&#x27;s best friend and a chemistry teacher at Stuckeyville High who eventually becomes the principal. Molly was unpopular in high school but becomes close friends with Carol and Nancy. She is Ed&#x27;s first client when he tries a case as he had never been to court while in New York, a case that he wins. Molly has insecurity issues due to her feeling that Carol is always the better half, but comes to assert herself more and more as the series goes on. She is liked by her students as a teacher and principal, and despite her insecurities, she is courted by many men during the series. During the bouquet toss at Carol and Ed&#x27;s wedding, she does not catch the bouquet but rather has it given to her by Carol as a sign of their deep friendship.
* Michael Ian Black as Philip &quot;Phil&quot; Stubbs. Phil is a natural slacker who runs the front counter at Stuckeybowl. He does not take his job very seriously and is always trying to hatch get-rich-quick schemes, using the bowling alley as a means to do so. He is terrible in managing his own money as he lives in a Motel 6 after he had been sleeping on the far right lane in the bowling alley. His schemes seem to get under Ed&#x27;s skin from time to time, but Phil is a loyal employee to Ed who refers to him as &quot;Bosco&quot; as a term of endearment. He is an ordained minister by the fictional &quot;Grand Exalted Church of the Universe&quot; via the internet and performs Ed and Carol&#x27;s wedding as the original minister refused to do so in a bowling alley.

==Production==

===The pilot===
While the premise of the show hinges on the changes in Ed&#x27;s life in New York and his initial return to Stuckeyville, the pilot which illustrated these events was not aired as part of the series. A summary using footage from the pilot, appeared at the beginning of the first regular episode.

The pilot also contained some notable casting choices, with Donal Logue portraying Phil and Janeane Garofalo guest-starring as Ed&#x27;s ex-wife Liz. Michael Ian Black replaced Logue as Phil in re-shot scenes of the first episode and for the entire series, and a number of different actresses played Liz in her few appearances (including Lea Thompson who played the character in several episodes near the end of the series).

The show was originally called &quot;Ed,&quot; then titled &quot;Stuckeyville&quot; when in development at CBS, and then renamed &quot;Ed&quot; again when it was picked up by NBC.

===Locations===
Although set in the fictional town of Stuckeyville, Ohio, the majority of the series was actually shot in various towns in northern New Jersey including Montclair, Hillsdale, Haworth, Westfield, Cranford, Nutley, Ridgewood, Harrington Park, Allendale, Northvale, Demarest and Rockland County, New York (Tappan, Nyack). Many of the street names and towns mentioned on the show are real New Jersey street and town names. The opening sequence showed Ed driving past the Rialto movie theater in the downtown of Westfield.
Stuckeybowl was actually the former Country Club Lanes in Northvale, NJ, and also served as the show&#x27;s headquarters. Many of the show&#x27;s other sets were built in a cleared out portion of the bowling alley such as the interiors of Stuckeyville High School, the courtroom, and The Smiling Goat. Country Club Lanes has since gone out of business, and was completely demolished in the late Spring of 2006, to make room for new housing.

===Theme song===
The opening credits theme song for the majority of the show&#x27;s run was &quot;Next Year&quot; by Foo Fighters, except during the entire second season when Clem Snide&#x27;s &quot;Moment in the Sun&quot; was used. Season three reverted to &quot;Next Year&quot; in the United States, after resolving the &quot;complicated business reasons&quot; that prevented its use the previous year. &quot;Moment in the Sun&quot; continued to be used outside the U.S., although the end credits list &quot;Next Year&quot; as the opening theme.

A framed Foo Fighters poster hung on the wall of Stuckeyville High School principal Molly Hudson&#x27;s office.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
The first season of &quot;Ed&quot; was met with favorable reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes for the first season it had an approval rating of 83% based on reviews from 24 critics, with an average score of 8.80/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: Tom Cavanagh&#x27;s Ed is ready to try a little tenderness in this sweet-natured romantic comedy that will leave most viewers with a giddy sugar high. Review aggregator website Metacritic, gave the show a score of 87 out of 100 based on 32 reviews. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Ken Tucker described it as &quot;the best new show of the season...possess[ing] all the bright romantic magic and tart humor of a first-rate screwball film comedy,&quot; with particular praise for the performances of Cavanagh and Bowen.

<doc id="375321" wikidata="Q505711" url="?curid=375321" title="Nattō">
<text>is a traditional Japanese food made from whole soybeans that have been fermented with &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; var. &quot;natto&quot;. It is often served as a breakfast food with rice. It is served with &quot;karashi&quot; mustard, soy or &quot;tare&quot; sauce, and sometimes Japanese bunching onion. Within Japan, &quot;nattō&quot; is most popular in the eastern regions, including Kantō, Tōhoku, and Hokkaido.

&quot;Nattō&quot; is often considered an acquired taste because of its powerful smell, strong flavor, and sticky, slimy texture. A 2009 survey revealed that 70% of Japanese people find the taste pleasant, and others who may not find the taste pleasant still eat the food out of habit.

==History==
Sources differ about the earliest origin of &quot;nattō&quot;. One theory is that nattō was codeveloped in multiple locations in the distant past, since it is simple to make with ingredients and tools commonly available in Japan since ancient times.

=== Legendary origins ===

One story about the origin of &quot;nattō&quot; attributes it to the samurai Minamoto no Yoshiie (1039–1106), who was on a campaign in northeastern Japan between 1086 and 1088 AD. One day, his troops were attacked while boiling soybeans for their horses. They hurriedly packed up the beans, and did not open the straw bags until a few days later, by which time the beans had fermented. The soldiers ate it anyway, and liked the taste, so they offered some to Yoshiie, who also liked the taste.

Another story involves Prince Shotoku (574–622), who is said to have wrapped the leftovers of boiled soybeans in straw bags for his horse. As people happened to eat these fermented beans and found them delicious, this type of fermented stringy beans soon gained popularity in Japan because of its unique taste and strong flavor.

=== Chinese &quot;douchi&quot; ===
Before &quot;nattō&quot;, there was a similar dish of fermented black soybeans food in China called () (chǐ) or &quot;douchi&quot; (). These are salted, fermented and aged whole soybean seasonings or condiments invented in China and spread throughout East Asia. They are usually made from fermented soybeans and with an ample amount of salt; however, the ingredients and production methods differ in Japan. Chinese use both black and yellow soybeans to produce &quot;douchi&quot;. The amount of salt used also differentiates &quot;douchi&quot; and &quot;nattō&quot; in taste and appearance.

The cultivation methods of soybeans and rice were imported from China to Japan during the Yayoi period, and later on, the circulation of salt began to flourish in Japan. This provided an opportunity for the production of &quot;douchi&quot; to become popular in Japan. Because salt was expensive at the time, it has been suggested that &quot;nattō&quot; was invented by accident during the production of &quot;douchi.&quot;

A wooden slip was excavated in Heijō-kyō, which had the Chinese character 豉 (chǐ; soybean) written on it. The excavation of the slip is considered an evidence to support the hypothesis that the invention of &quot;nattō&quot; was based on the Chinese &quot;douchi&quot; imported to Japan.

The Chinese character 豉 entered Japan in the 8th century. It was pronounced &quot;kuki&quot; until the 11th century, when &quot;nattō&quot; became a new name for fermented soybeans.

===Commercialization in the Taisho period===

A change in the production of &quot;nattō&quot; occurred in the Taishō period (1912–1926), when researchers discovered a way to produce a &quot;nattō&quot; starter culture containing &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; without the need for straw, thereby simplifying the commercial production of &quot;nattō&quot; and enabling more consistent results.

== Nutrition ==

Nattō is 55% water, 13% carbohydrates, 19% protein, and 11% fat (table). In a serving, nattō supplies 110 calories and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of several dietary minerals, especially iron (33% DV) and manganese (73% DV), and vitamin K (542% DV). Nattō contains some B vitamins and vitamin C in moderate amounts (table).

==Appearance and consumption==
&quot;Nattō&quot; has a distinctive odor, somewhat akin to a pungent aged cheese. Stirring &quot;nattō&quot; produces many sticky strings. The dish is eaten cold with rice, mixed with the included soy sauce or karashi mustard if eaten from a commercially packaged &quot;nattō&quot;. Other ingredients such as long onion or kimchi are often added.

&quot;Nattō&quot; is frequently eaten as &quot;nattō&quot; &quot;gohan&quot; (&quot;nattō&quot; on rice). &quot;Nattō&quot; is occasionally used in other foods, such as &quot;nattō&quot; sushi (nattōmaki), &quot;nattō&quot; toast, in miso soup, tamagoyaki, salad, as an ingredient in okonomiyaki, chahan, or even with spaghetti. Sometimes soybeans are crushed before fermenting.

Many find the taste unpleasant and smelly while others relish it as a delicacy. Nattō is more popular in some areas of Japan than in others. &quot;Nattō&quot; is known to be popular in the eastern Kantō region, but less popular in Kansai.

For those who dislike the smell and texture of natto, &quot;dried natto&quot; and &quot;fried natto&quot; were developed around 1990. The smell and stickiness are reduced, making it easier to eat for those who do not like conventional natto. Another type of fermented soybeans called &quot;mamenoka&quot; () has also been developed by improving the soybean and natto bacillus varieties to make it less sticky.

==Production process==
===Commercial===
&quot;Nattō&quot; is made from soybeans, typically &quot;nattō&quot; soybeans. Smaller beans are preferred, as the fermentation process will be able to reach the center of the bean more easily. The beans are washed and soaked in water for 12 to 20 hours to hydrate them, and increase their size. Next, the soybeans are steamed for six hours, although a pressure cooker may be used to reduce the time. The cooked beans are mixed with the bacterium &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;, known as &quot;nattō-kin&quot; in Japanese. From this point on, care must be taken to keep the ingredients away from impurities and other bacteria. The mixture is fermented at for up to 24 hours. Afterward, the &quot;nattō&quot; is cooled, then aged in a refrigerator for up to one week to allow the development of stringiness.

In &quot;nattō&quot;-making facilities, these processing steps have to be done while avoiding incidents in which soybeans are touched by workers. Even though workers use &quot;B. subtilis natto&quot; as the starting culture, which can suppress some undesired bacterial growth, workers pay extra-close attention not to introduce skin flora onto soybeans.

===Home===
&quot;Nattō&quot; continues to be a popular home fermentation activity with some families starting new batches daily. Home production was historically done using rice straw to maintain moisture and as insulation with placement in naturally warmer parts of the home or fermentation shed, but is now done with moist towels over glass pans or perforated plastic wrap on thermostat-controlled heating pads. At-home fermentation machines are also available but are rarely marketed specifically for &quot;nattō&quot;, which is a less finicky culture capable of sustaining its own ideal temperature once it gets going.

Mass-produced &quot;nattō&quot; is sold in small polystyrene containers. A typical package contains two, three, or occasionally four containers, each . One container typically complements a small bowl of rice.

&quot;Nattō&quot; odor comes from diacetyl and pyrazines, but if it is allowed to ferment too long, then ammonia is released.

The fermenting of &quot;nattō&quot; develops glutamic acid, which is why it has an umami flavour.

<text>The sharp-tailed sandpiper (Calidris acuminata) is a small-medium migratory wader or shorebird, found mostly in Siberia during the summer breeding period (June to August) and Australia for wintering (September to March).

== Taxonomy ==
The genus name &quot;calidris&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific &quot;acuminata&quot; is from Latin &quot;acuminatus&quot;, &#x27;sharp, pointed&#x27;.

It had previously been suggested that the sharp-tailed sandpiper should perhaps be placed into the genus &quot;Philomachus&quot; 
– as &quot;P. acuminatus&quot; – which contains the ruff, however this proposed change has yet to receive widespread acceptance.

== Description ==
A small-medium wader, the portly sandpiper has a pot belly, flat back and somewhat drawn-out rear end. It has a mottled chestnut-brown upper body with sharp-looking feathers with a dark centre, a chestnut cap on its head and a brown stripe through each eye. Its bill is dark grey to black and straight, and its legs are olive- to yellow-coloured. The underparts are white or paler in colour, with the mottling similar to that on the breast and sides of the belly. The plumage is duller during wintering and more vivid during the breeding season. The juveniles are brighter in colour during wintering than adults, with sharper feathers and brighter chestnut-coloured crowns contrasting with the white mantle stripes and bright, buffy chests.

A similar-looking species is the pectoral sandpiper, within whose Asian range the sharp-tailed sandpiper breeds. It differs from that species in its breast pattern, stronger supercilium, and more chestnut-coloured crown. It has some similarities to the long-toed stint, but is much larger.

===Measurements===
* Size: 22 cm
* Weight: 39–114 g
* Wingspan: 36–43 cm

== Distribution and occurrence ==
Sharp-tailed sandpipers are strongly migratory, breeding solely in eastern Siberia from the Taymyr Peninsula to Chaunskaya Bay in Chukotka. They have a complex migration, with adults departing Siberia in July and juveniles in August to head south, where the majority of the population winters in Australasia. They take two main routes, with the majority of post-breeding adults flying south in flocks of less than 1000, east of Lake Baikal, to the Pacific coast of Russia and the Yellow Sea coasts of China and Korea. They mostly all fly directly to Micronesia and New Guinea in late August, departing here with the onset of the wet season to northwest Australia in mid-September. They start moving towards southeast Australia with numbers peaking in December to February. The other route heads east, taking most juveniles and a few adults into Alaska across the Bering Strait. Staying here from mid-August to late October to fatten up, it is presumed they then take a direct non-stop trans-Pacific flight of more than 10,000 km to reach Australia and New Zealand. Some will continue south along the Pacific coast of North America into Washington, less frequently to California, and possibly into Latin America, but only two recent records occur in Panama and Bolivia.

It occurs as a rare autumn migrant to North America, but in western Europe only as a very rare migrant with records in 11 different countries, mostly in the United Kingdom, between August and October. It has been recorded in the Middle East and Central Asia, six times in Kazakhstan, once in Yemen and Oman. Within the Indian Ocean they have been documented at Christmas Island four times, totalling 16 birds between October and December. There have been three recorded observations at Cocos Island in November and December; five records at the Chagos archipelago from September to December; and five records in Seychelles, one in July, two in September to February overwintering, and two on passage in November. They have been recently documented in Mozambique, recorded in southern Africa for the first time in 2018.

== Habitat ==
In Siberia the breeding ground is mostly tundra made up of peat-hummock and lichen. On passage between breeding and wintering areas they favor the muddy edges of shallow freshwater or brackish wetlands with grass, emergent or inundated sedges, saltmarsh or other low vegetation. These include swamps, lakes, lagoons, and pools near coasts, waterholes, dams, saltpans and hypersaline salt lakes inland. In Alaska they seem to prefer coastal moist graminoid meadows and riverine intertidally exposed mudbanks. In Australia they are largely found around wetlands, preferring freshwater inland wetlands with grassy edges. Once the ephemeral terrestrial wetlands have dried out, they tend to be seen on coastal mudflats, salt marsh and brackish lagoons and less often on similar wet fields of short grass. Other areas they have been spotted in Australia include around sewage farms, flooded fields, mangroves, rocky shores and beaches.

== Behaviour ==
Little is known about the specific behaviour of the sharp-tailed sandpiper, but generally its behaviour and structure are most similar to the pectoral sandpiper.

=== Breeding ===
Sharp-tailed sandpipers breed from to June to August in the short Siberian summer, making shallow, hollow, lined nests made of leaves and grass. The nests are hidden on the ground and hard to distinguish from surrounding the surrounding landscape. The clutch size is usually four eggs, with the females incubating and raising the chicks. The breeding plumage is more vivid, with breast feathers greater in chestnut colour and their chevron-shaped markings becoming more defined.

=== Foraging and feeding ===
Sharp-tailed sandpipers forage on the edge of wetlands, intertidal mudflats, either on sand or bare wet mud and in shallow water. They will also forage among inundated vegetation of grass, sedges or saltmarsh. After rain they can be found in paddocks of short grass, well away from water. At low tides they can be found on the intertidal mudflats, before moving inland to freshwater wetlands at the high tide. Occasionally they forage on dry or wet mats of algae, among rotting seaweed or seagrass on beaches, edges of stony wetlands and exposed reefs. Picking up food by sight or sometimes by probing, they mainly eat aquatic insects, molluscs, crustaceans, worms, occasionally seeds and other invertebrates.

== Conservation ==
The species is currently listed as vulnerable globally by the IUCN in 2021, with an estimated number of 60,000 to 120,000 mature individuals and a decreasing population trend. The major threats to the species are habitat loss, with the staging areas used in migration being reduced through reclamation of land for aquaculture or degraded from human activities. In Australia this occurs through clearing, inundation, draining or infilling of wetlands, and reduces the availability of foraging and roosting sites. This affects their ability to build up the energy to complete the return trip back to the breeding grounds in Siberia. Habitat degradation also occurs in the form of the loss of riparian vegetation, invasive species, water pollution, and hydrological regime changes from human-induced regulation. Sharp-tailed sandpipers are also subject to disturbance from humans, namely in encroaching residential and recreational activities, disturbing their breeding and foraging habits. They also experience increased direct mortality from hunting, vehicle collisions, aircraft strikes and predation by pest fauna, foxes and cats.

<text>The zoopraxiscope (initially named &quot;zoographiscope&quot; and &quot;zoogyroscope&quot;) is an early device for displaying moving images and is considered an important predecessor of the movie projector. It was conceived by photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge in 1879 (and built for him by January 1880 to project his famous chronophotographic pictures in motion and thus prove that these were authentic). Muybridge used the projector in his public lectures from 1880 to 1895. The projector used 16&quot; glass disks onto which Muybridge had an unidentified artist paint the sequences as silhouettes. This technique eliminated the backgrounds and enabled the creation of fanciful combinations and additional imaginary elements. Only one disk used photographic images, of a horse skeleton posed in different positions. A later series of 12″ discs, made in 1892–1894, used outlines drawn by Erwin F. Faber that were printed onto the discs photographically, then colored by hand. These colored discs were probably never used in Muybridge&#x27;s lectures. All images of the known 71 disks, including those of the photographic disk, were rendered in elongated form to compensate the distortion of the projection. The projector was related to other projecting phenakistiscopes and used some slotted metal shutter discs that were interchangeable for different picture disks or different effects on the screen. The machine was hand-cranked.

The device appears to have been one of the primary inspirations for Thomas Edison and William Kennedy Dickson&#x27;s Kinetoscope, the first commercial film exhibition system. Images from all of the known seventy-one surviving zoopraxiscope discs have been reproduced in the book &quot;Eadweard Muybridge: The Kingston Museum Bequest&quot; (The Projection Box, 2004).

As stipulated in Muybridge&#x27;s will, the original machine and disks in his possession were left to Kingston upon Thames, where they are still kept in the Kingston Museum Muybridge Bequest Collection (except for four discs that are in other collections, including those of the Cinémathèque française and the National Technical Museum in Prague).

Muybridge also produced a series of 50 different paper &#x27;Zoopraxiscope discs&#x27; (basically phenakistiscopes), again with pictures drawn by Erwin F. Faber. The discs were intended for sale at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, but seem to have sold very poorly and are quite rare. The discs were printed in black-and-white, with twelve different discs also produced as chromolithographed versions. Of the coloured versions only four different ones are known to still exist (with a total of five or six extant copies).

<text>In all modern states, a portion of land is held by central or local governments. This is called public land, state land, or Crown land (Commonwealth realms). The system of tenure of public land, and the terminology used, varies between countries. The following examples illustrate some of the range.

==Commonwealth realms==
In several Commonwealth realms such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada, public lands are referred to as Crown lands. Recent proposals to sell Crown lands have been highly controversial.

==France==
In France, () may be held by communes, &quot;départements&quot;, or the central State.

==Portugal==
In Portugal the land owned by the State, by the two autonomous regions (Azores and Madeira) and by the local governments (municipalities (Portuguese: &quot;municípios&quot;) and &quot;freguesias&quot;) can be of two types: public domain (Portuguese: &quot;domínio público&quot;) and private domain (Portuguese: &quot;domínio privado&quot;). The latter is owned like any private entity (and may be sold), while public domain land cannot be sold and it is expected to be used by the public (although it can be leased to private entities for up to 75 years in certain cases). Examples of public domain land are the margins of the sea and of the rivers, roads, streets, railways, ports, military areas, monuments. The State&#x27;s private domain is managed by Direção-Geral do Tesouro e Finanças and the State&#x27;s public domain is managed by various entities (state companies and state institutes, such as the Portuguese Environment Agency, Infraestruturas de Portugal, &quot;Administração do Porto de Lisboa&quot; S.A., etc.).

==West Bank==

Public lands on the West Bank of Palestine are in part based on the Ottoman Empire law specifying that land not worked for over ten years becomes &quot;state lands&quot;.

==United States==



In the United States, governmental entities at all levels- including townships, cities, counties, states, and the federal government- all manage land which are referred to as either public lands or the public domain.

The majority of public lands in the United States are held in trust for the American people by the federal government and managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the United States National Park Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, or the Fish and Wildlife Service under the Department of the Interior, or by the United States Forest Service under the Department of Agriculture. Other federal agencies that manage public lands include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Department of Defense, which includes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

In general, Congress must legislate the creation or acquisition of new public lands, such as national parks; however, under the 1906 Antiquities Act, also known as the National Monuments Act, the President may designate new national monuments without congressional authorization if the monument is on federally-owned land.

Each western state also received federal &quot;public land&quot; as trust lands designated for specific beneficiaries, which the States are to manage as a condition to acceptance into the union. Those trust lands cannot any longer be considered public lands as allowing any benefits to the &quot;public&quot; would be in breach of loyalty to the specific beneficiaries. The trust lands (two sections, or about per township) are usually managed extractively (grazing or mining), to provide revenue for public schools. All states have some lands under state management, such as state parks, state wildlife management areas, and state forests.

Wilderness is a special designation for public lands which have been completely undeveloped. The concept of wilderness areas was legislatively defined by the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas can be managed by any of the above Federal agencies, and some parks and refuges are almost entirely designated wilderness. A wilderness study area is a tract of land that has wilderness characteristics, and is managed as wilderness, but has not received a wilderness designation from Congress.

Typically each parcel is governed by its own set of laws and rules that explain the purpose for which the land was acquired, and how the land may be used.

===History===
The concept of a formal designation and conservation of public lands dates back to the first National Parks. While designating the parks as public, the conservation was another matter. Theodore Roosevelt and his conservation group, Boone and Crockett Club created laws and regulations that protected public land. Roosevelt and the Boone and Crockett Club continued on influencing the creation of large amounts of public lands including the National Refuge System, USFS and the United States National Forest system.

===Recreation on U.S. public lands===
Most state- and federally managed public lands are open for recreational use. Recreation opportunities depend on the managing agency, and run the gamut from the less restrictive, undeveloped wide open spaces of BLM lands to the highly developed and controlled national and state parks. Wildlife refuges and state wildlife management areas, managed primarily to improve habitat, are generally open to wildlife watching, hiking, and hunting, except for closures to protect mating and nesting, or to reduce stress on wintering animals. National forests generally have a mix of maintained trails and roads, wilderness and undeveloped portions, and developed picnic and camping areas.

===Grazing on U.S. public lands===
Historically in the western United States, much public land is leased for grazing by cattle or sheep (most National Park Service areas are closed to livestock grazing). This includes vast tracts of National Forest and BLM land, as well as land on some Wildlife Refuges. National Parks are the exception. This use became controversial in the late 20th century as it was examined by environmentalists and scientists concerned about the impact of these exotic animals on native plant populations and watersheds.

===Oil and gas drilling and mining on U.S. public lands===
Large tracts of public land in the United States are available for leasing for petroleum or mineral production. Lands which have a high likelihood of producing valuable resources can, as of 2018, command prices as high as $80,000 an acre per year. Large tracts of other lands, where the likelihood of the presence or successful exploitation of resources are very low, could be leased, as of 2018, for as low as $1.50 an acre per year. The Trump administration greatly expanded mineral leasing resulting in a substantial increase in fracking in likely locations in Wyoming and New Mexico, but a great deal of land where prospects for successful production were limited was leased at very low rates to speculators.

<doc id="375332" wikidata="Q258686" url="?curid=375332" title="Ladysmith Black Mambazo">
<text>Ladysmith Black Mambazo are a South African male choral group singing in the local vocal styles of &quot;isicathamiya&quot; and &quot;mbube&quot;. They became known internationally after singing with American Paul Simon on his 1986 album &quot;Graceland.&quot; They have since won multiple awards, including five Grammy Awards the fifth of which they dedicated to the late former South African President Nelson Mandela.

Formed by Joseph Shabalala in 1960, Ladysmith Black Mambazo became one of South Africa&#x27;s most prolific musical groups. Their releases received gold and platinum disc honours in both South Africa and abroad. The group became a mobile academy of South African cultural heritage through their African indigenous &quot;isicathamiya&quot; music.

==History==
===1960–1986===

The first incarnation of Ladysmith Black Mambazo was &quot;Ezimnyama&quot; (&quot;The Black Ones&quot;), formed by Joseph Shabalala in December 1960. The members of the group were relatives (mostly brothers and cousins) of Shabalala, with many having sung with him while he was growing up on the farm where he was born. Although the group did sing well together and captured the sound of &quot;cothoza mfana&quot; (&quot;tiptoe boys&quot;, a 1960s slang term for &quot;isicathamiya&quot;, the traditional music of the Zulu people) and mbube groups of the time, they were unknown outside of the Ladysmith district.

In 1964, Shabalala had a series of recurring dreams during his sleep, over a period of six months, featuring a choir singing in perfect harmony. Shabalala described this as a beautiful sound, and one not yet achieved by his group of the time. As a result, he reformed the group, bringing on board newer (younger) relatives but keeping the group name. He strove to teach them the harmonies from his dreams, creating what was to become a signature tune for the group: &quot;Nomathemba&quot; (a girl&#x27;s name, meaning &quot;hope&quot;). After deciding that this group well replicated the beautiful, soft sounds from his dreams, Shabalala entered the group into isicathamiya competitions, held on Saturday nights in the halls of hostels in Durban and Johannesburg. The group managed to win nearly every competition that was held. As a result, Shabalala decided to change the name of the group to be more descriptive of its talent. The name &quot;Ezimnyama&quot; was replaced by &quot;Ladysmith Black Mambazo&quot;.

The three elements of the new name were: the hometown of Shabalala&#x27;s family, Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal; the black ox, considered to be the strongest farm animal; and &quot;mambazo&quot;, which means &quot;axe&quot; in the Zulu language, and is symbolic of the choir&#x27;s ability to &quot;chop down&quot; the competition.

Eventually, by the early 1970s, the group was forbidden to compete in the competitions because of their continual success. They were, however, welcome to perform without taking part in the competition itself.

In 1967, the group began to make recordings for the SABC station &quot;Radio Zulu&quot;, appearing in DJ Alexius Buthelezi&#x27;s popular &quot;Cothoza Mfana&quot; programme, which spotlighted the music of several local choirs. Their success was so great that music producers began enticing the group to sign a recording contract. In 1972 the group signed with Gallo Record Company under producer West Nkosi at the organisation&#x27;s African music division, Mavuthela Music Company (Nkosi was also well known in South Africa as a saxophone jive star). Ladysmith Black Mambazo released their first album the following year, &quot;Amabutho&quot;, which received gold status and was the first album by a black musician or group in South Africa to do so. Their subsequent albums also received gold or platinum certification. With the release of their second album, they had become professional singers.

The group saw many changes; whereas the early line-ups were formed of a few Shabalalas and two (Funokwakhe and Joseph) Mazibukos, the group largely included members unrelated to Joseph.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artist/ Track Listing&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Shabalala&#x27;s cousin Mdletshe Albert Mazibuko (the eldest of the six brothers) joined Mambazo in 1969 as a tenor voice, with his younger brother Milton as an alto voice. Albert is the longest remaining member of Ladysmith Black Mambazo aside from Joseph Shabalala and has been a full-time member of the group since 1973. After the killing of his brother Milton in 1980, Albert remained in the line-up, by which time his brothers Funokwakhe Mazibuko and Joseph Mazibuko had left Ladysmith Black Mambazo and his youngest brother Abednego had joined.

In 1976, Shabalala converted to Christianity and a host of religious material now entered the group&#x27;s repertoire. Mambazo&#x27;s first religious album, &quot;Ukukhanya Kwelanga&quot;, was released soon afterwards. It earned a double platinum disc award, and the group&#x27;s repertoire came to be dominated by hymns, mostly Methodist. Their 1976 LP &quot;Ukusindiswa&quot; became one of their most popular religious albums, selling double gold discs within three weeks of release. By 1981, the group&#x27;s popularity was such that the apartheid government allowed the members to travel to Cologne, Germany as part of a South African folk music festival. The group toured West Germany and appeared on television, and learned some of the German language; for the group&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Phansi Emgodini&quot;, Shabalala composed a song entitled &quot;Wir Grüssen Euch Alle&quot; (&quot;We greet you all&quot;). The following year, the group travelled back to Germany to appear on a televised quiz programme, bringing about requests for more live appearances. A track by the group also appeared on the groundbreaking British compilation album &quot;The Indestructible Beat of Soweto&quot;.

===1986–1993===
In 1985, Paul Simon travelled to South Africa in the hope of collaborating with African musicians for his &quot;Graceland&quot; album. Simon contacted Shabalala and conversed with him in person — after much discussion and excitement, the group travelled to London to record with Simon. The first recording was &quot;Homeless&quot; — the music and chorus were composed by Simon, with Shabalala composing the Zulu introduction and main (non-English) body of the song. They also sang on the song &quot;Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes&quot; and &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot;. Simon brought the group to New York City to perform on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and they performed &quot;Diamonds...&quot; prior to the album or song being released. &quot;Graceland&quot; was released in late 1986, and although both Joseph Shabalala and Paul Simon were accused of breaking the cultural boycott of South Africa, the album became a huge success and sold 16 million copies and further boosted Ladysmith Black Mambazo&#x27;s international image. This also paved the way for other African acts such as Stimela and Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens to gain popularity among Western audiences.

After &quot;Graceland&quot;, Simon acted as producer for their first album for US release on Warner Brothers Records, &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot; (1987). &quot;Shaka Zulu&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Recording in 1988. Two more records were recorded for Warner Brothers Records in the US: &quot;Journey of Dreams&quot; (1988) and &quot;Two Worlds One Heart&quot; (1990). On the latter album, the group recorded with The Winans, Julia Fordham and George Clinton among other then-popular artists.

The success of the &quot;Graceland&quot; recording and subsequent concert tours led to a strong touring life for the group that continues to this day. Ladysmith Black Mambazo perform concert tours around the world for six or more months every year.

In 1988, Ladysmith Black Mambazo appeared in Michael Jackson&#x27;s movie &quot;Moonwalker&quot;, where they performed &quot;The Moon Is Walking&quot; (an abridged version of the song &quot;Lindelani&quot;, which appears on &quot;Journey of Dreams&quot;) over the end credits. Ladysmith Black Mambazo was also featured in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; song &quot;Put Down the Duckie&quot;, as well as &quot;The African Alphabet&quot;.

In 1988, Ladysmith Black Mambazo sang &quot;Mbube&quot; during the opening sequence of the Eddie Murphy movie &quot;Coming to America&quot;, but the song was not released on the soundtrack.

In August 1990, Ladysmith Black Mambazo performed together with the Cologne group Bläck Fööss in front of the Cologne Cathedral.

On 10 December 1991, Shabalala&#x27;s brother and one of the bass members in the group, Headman Shabalala, was shot and killed by Sean Nicholas, a white off-duty security guard. Headman&#x27;s death was followed by the retirement of two members in 1993 and Shabalala recruited three of his sons into the group.

===1993–2002===
The apartheid system was officially abolished in 1991, and democratic general elections did not commence until 1994. The release of Nelson Mandela after 27 years imprisonment brought a celebratory album release - 1993&#x27;s &quot;Liph&#x27; Iqiniso&quot;. Mandela (shortly after his release from prison) publicly stated that the members of Ladysmith Black Mambazo were &quot;South Africa&#x27;s cultural ambassadors&quot;. At Mandela&#x27;s request, Ladysmith Black Mambazo accompanied the future President of South Africa to the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo, Norway, in 1993. Mambazo sang again at President Mandela&#x27;s inauguration in May 1994, and then later at his birthday celebrations.

In 1993 four sons of Joseph Shabalala, Thamsanqa, Msizi, Thulani, and Sibongiseni, who had been in the junior choir Mshengu White Mambazo, moved up to join the group proper.

In 1995 South Africa was the host and eventual winners of the Rugby World Cup, in which Ladysmith Black Mambazo collaborated with PJ Powers in recording and performing World in Union.

In 1996, the group appeared on Dolly Parton&#x27;s album &quot;Treasures,&quot; collaborating with Parton on a cover of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Peace Train&quot;; they joined Parton for an appearance on a November 1996 US network television special to perform the song.

In 1997, for a run of UK television advertisements, &quot;Toast for Life&quot;, for Heinz soups, baked beans and tomato ketchup, the group recorded an abridged version of &quot;Inkanyezi Nezazi&quot; (&quot;The Star and the Wiseman&quot;). The adverts proved so popular that the original studio version (recorded back in 1992) was released as a single and reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was followed up by &quot;The Best of Ladysmith Black Mambazo - The Star and the Wiseman&quot; in 1998, a compilation release that became so popular it was certified triple platinum, selling 1 million copies in Britain alone. The Heinz campaign led to a reawakening of the group in Britain, and many television and radio performances beckoned over the next few years, as well as performing for the British royal family. In 1999, the group collaborated with Irish pop group B*Witched on their single &quot;I Shall Be There&quot;, which hit No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2001, the group was referenced in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Lethal Weapons&quot;.

A film documentary about Ladysmith Black Mambazo, &quot;On Tiptoe: Gentle Steps to Freedom&quot;, was released in 2000. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) in 2001, but lost out to &quot;Big Mama&quot;. The movie was presented the Best Short Documentary award by the 2001 International Documentary Association.

===2002–2006===

The group began preparations for &quot;Wenyukela&quot;, an album of new material, in 2002. However, the making of the record underwent severe strain when, in May 2002, Shabalala&#x27;s wife of 30 years (and lead singer in the allied group &quot;Women of Mambazo&quot;), Nellie, was murdered in a church car park by a masked gunman. Shabalala&#x27;s hand was injured trying to protect his wife. Joseph&#x27;s son Vivian Nkosinathi was accused of hiring a hitman to murder his stepmother Nellie. During the court trial, Nkosinathi supposedly testified that the South African police offered some kind of reprieve if he would implicate his own father, Joseph, in the murder. &quot;Wenyukela&quot;, however, went ahead, as Shabalala began to recover.

&quot;Wenyukela&quot; was a success in South Africa, prompting its release in Britain in March 2003 on Wrasse Records. Following the repeated success of the album, the American-based Heads Up International released the album in January 2004 and it garnered the group their second Grammy Award.

Joseph&#x27;s brother Ben Shabalala, a former member of the group who had retired in 1993 after the death of Headman, was killed in a Durban suburb in June 2004.

The group is referenced in the 2004 film Mean Girls when Lindsay Lohan&#x27;s character chooses not to accompany her parents to a Ladysmith Black Mambazo concert. 

===2006–2008===

&quot;Long Walk to Freedom&quot;, a celebration of 45 years of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, was released by the group in January 2006. On the album the group recorded with a multitude of artists including Zap Mama, Sarah McLachlan, Melissa Etheridge, Joe McBride, Natalie Merchant, Emmylou Harris, and Taj Mahal as well as South African musicians Lucky Dube, Phuzekhemisi, Bhekumuzi Luthuli, Nokukhanya, Thandiswa, Vusi Mahlasela and Hugh Masekela.
The release garnered the group their 13th Grammy Award nomination. Though it did not win the Grammy Award it showed the group&#x27;s creative powers were still being recognised.

In April 2006, Mambazo collaborated with Josh Groban for his third studio album, &quot;Awake&quot;. The songs, &quot;Weeping&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot;, featured a clear South African influence; lines from a Mambazo song, &quot;Wangibambezela&quot; (&quot;Message from his Heart&quot;) were added to the backing track of &quot;Weeping&quot;. Following this, in August 2006, Mambazo began working with Mavis Staples in a collaboration for Staples&#x27;s new album. The television program &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; featured the group in a &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; sketch, hosted by Dennis Haysbert, about failed Saturday morning cartoons starring black cartoon characters, one of which was a cartoon featuring the group, called &quot;Ladysmith Black Mambazo in Outer Space&quot;. Members of the group added commentary to the short for the DVD release of the SNL special &quot;The Best of TV Funhouse&quot;.

On 17 October 2006, Ladysmith Black Mambazo performed a sold-out concert, at New York&#x27;s famed Carnegie Hall, billed as &quot;Long Walk to Freedom: An Evening with Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Friends&quot;. The night included special guest appearances by Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, Mahotella Queens, Vusi Mahlasela, and Pete Seeger. The concert was recorded but due to venue restrictions is not being allowed to be released.

Their 2007 CD, &quot;Ilembe&quot;, was released in South Africa on 26 February 2007 and worldwide on 22 January 2008, under the title &quot;&quot;, on Heads Up International.

===2008–present===
There had been many questions on when founder, director, composer, and lead singer Joseph Shabalala would finally retire from his group. On 23 January 2008, Shabalala issued a statement on this.

The full statement is reproduced below:

Ladysmith Black Mambazo&#x27;s 2007 release, &quot;&quot;, garnered success around the world. In 2008 the group won the SAMA Award for &quot;Best Traditional A Cappella Album&quot; for &quot;Ilembe&quot; and in 2009 won the Grammy Award for &quot;Best Traditional World Music Album&quot;, marking their third Grammy Award.

In January 2011 the group released a recording of original songs, &quot;Songs from a Zulu Farm&quot;. It received some of the best reviews the group had ever known, landing in the top five of most &quot;Best World Music Releases&quot; for 2011. It was nominated for a Grammy Award but did not win. It was also nominated for the Best Album of 2011 at the South African Music Awards.

In January 2013 the group released a new album, &quot;Live: Singing for Peace Around the World&quot;, which was dedicated to South African icon and former President Nelson Mandela. On 6 December 2013 it was announced that the album had been nominated by the Grammy Awards for Best World Music CD. This announcement came the day after the passing of Mandela. On 26 January 2014, the Grammy Awards announced it had won Best World Music CD for 2013. This was the fourth Grammy Award for the group and third since 2004. As well, in January 2014, Ladysmith released &quot;Always With Us&quot;, as a tribute to Joseph Shabalala&#x27;s deceased wife. They are also currently recording a CD of American gospel songs, which will have a well known American singer joining them on the CD. They are also recording a follow-up recording to their recent Grammy-winning CD, to be called &quot;Songs of Peace &amp; Love for Kids &amp; Parents Around the World&quot;.

Ladysmith Black Mambazo was featured on the track &quot;Lift Me Up&quot;, along with Norwegian duo Nico &amp; Vinz, on David Guetta&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Listen&quot;. Other features in 2016 include a vocal appearance on &quot;Facing a Task Unfinished&quot; by Keith and Kristyn Getty, &quot;Wake Up&quot; by Jennifer Saran, and Vian Izak&#x27;s single &quot;Brink of Love&quot;.

==Foundation==

In January 1999, Joseph Shabalala founded &quot;The Ladysmith Black Mambazo Foundation&quot;. The aim of the organisation is to teach young Zulu South African children about their traditional culture and music, &quot;isicathamiya&quot;. Today, the Mambazo Academy is currently being built, with plans for a rehearsal hall, teaching areas and a professional recording studio. The main aim is to promote and teach the history of &quot;isicathamiya&quot; music to young people.

==Touring past and future==
===Competitions and the first Mambazo concerts===
After the release of the group&#x27;s first album, Amabutho, in 1973, they were banned from competing in the &quot;isicathamiya&quot; competitions because of their ability to win many of the competitions. They were, however, welcome to perform for the audience. Following this, the group started performing for their own audiences in shows that were specially made and, soon afterwards, the group began touring around South Africa in their own concerts, but due to the Apartheid system in use, they were often stopped by police guards; on some of these occasions they were even made to lie down on the ground whilst being searched. Shortly afterwards, they were allowed to tour without permits.

===&quot;Graceland&quot; success===
By 1986, the group had a very small number of white fans in South Africa; the majority of their fan base was black people (the group mainly toured in townships). After Paul Simon included the group on his &quot;&quot;Graceland&quot; Tour of 1987&quot;, the group began touring by themselves and became very widely known.

===Future touring===
The group has been recognised as the most successful world music artists and have a healthy touring schedule. When asked if the group has any plans to stop their travelling, of over six months each year, the response has always been: &quot;Not as long as the people of the world want to hear our music. We are the traveling musical academy for South African culture and it is our responsibility to continue on this journey.&quot;

== Membership ==

Initially, the group comprised Joseph Shabalala, his brothers Headman and Enoch, cousins Albert, Milton, Funokwakhe, Abednego, and Joseph Mazibuko, as well as close friends Matovoti Msimanga and Walter Malinga. Altogether, the group has had more than 30 different members at one point or another over the past 45 years. However, since 1993 there have only been two membership changes due to retirements.

The members of the group currently reside in or near Pinetown, just outside the coastal city of Durban in KwaZulu-Natal. The chorus&#x27; members are Joseph Shabalala&#x27;s sons Thamsanqa, Msizi, Thulani, and Sibongiseni; cousins Albert and Abednego Mazibuko; and close friends Russel Mthembu and Ngane Dlamini.

<text>Samuel Ward King (May 23, 1786 – January 20, 1851) was the 15th Governor of Rhode Island from 1839 to 1843. He was born in Johnston, Rhode Island to William Borden King and Welthian Walton King.

King attended Brown University but did not graduate. He became a medical doctor and worked as a surgeon during the War of 1812.

In 1820, King was elected town clerk of Johnston. He became a Whig when the party was founded, and was a presidential elector in 1832. In 1838, he was elected to the Rhode Island Senate. He first became governor in 1839 when the legislature failed to grant a majority of votes to the three leading contenders. He was elected to three other terms.

During his administration as governor, he took a strong stand against the expanded voting franchise that led to the Dorr Rebellion in 1841 – 1842. President John Tyler refused to send in Federal troops at Governor King&#x27;s request to suppress the uprising.

King married Catherine Latham Angell, with whom he had 14 children. He is buried in the King family plot in Johnston near the intersection of US Route 6A and Killingly Street.

<text>Kereopa Te Rau (? – 5 January 1872) was a leader of Pai Mārire (Hauhau), a Māori religion. He played a key role in the Volkner Incident and was subsequently hanged for his part in it.

==Early life==
Little is known of Kereopa&#x27;s early life but he was of the Ngāti Rangiwewehi &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe) of the Te Arawa confederation of tribes. He was baptised by the Catholic missionary Father Euloge Reignier in the 1840s and was given the Christian name of Kereopa, the Māori pronunciation of the Biblical name Cleopas. He may have served as a police officer in Auckland during the 1850s. He is known to have fought for the King Movement during the Invasion of the Waikato in 1863. His wife and two daughters are believed to have been killed in an attack mounted on 21 February 1864 by government forces on the village of Rangiaowhia near Te Awamutu in 1864. His sister was killed in defence of nearby Hairini the next day.

==Pai Mārire==
Shortly afterwards Kereopa met up with the prophet Te Ua Haumēne and converted to the Pai Mārire faith. In December 1864 he was sent on a mission to the tribes of the East Coast. His instructions were to go in peace and avoid confrontations with the Pākehā. While he was at Ōpōtiki the missionary Carl Volkner was seized, tried, hanged and decapitated by his own congregation in what became known as the Volkner Incident. Immediately afterwards Kereopa preached a sermon from Volkner&#x27;s pulpit during which he gouged the missionary&#x27;s eyes out of his head and ate them.

Kereopa and his Pai Mārire followers went on to Gisborne, and then to the Urewera mountains to preach to the Tūhoe people. In 1865 he tried to return to the Waikato but was repulsed by a war party of Ngāti Manawa and Ngāti Rangitihi, kūpapa Maori who supported the government. Following the resulting battle Kereopa is said to have eaten the eyes of three of the slain enemy. For this and the eating of Volkner&#x27;s eyes, he was nicknamed &quot;Kai Whatu&quot; (Eye Eater). He then retreated to the Ureweras where he found refuge and remained in hiding for the next five years.

In the early 1870s government forces searching for Te Kooti entered the Ureweras. The Tūhoe were conquered and British colonial law and order was established. Kereopa, who had a bounty of £1,000 for his capture, was hiding near Ruatahuna. Major Ropata Wahawaha led a Ngāti Porou party there and Tūhoe handed over Kereopa to him on 18 November.

Kereopa was tried for Volkner&#x27;s murder in Napier on 21 December 1871. He was convicted and, despite appeals for clemency from the missionary William Colenso, who noted punishment had already been meted out for the crime, was hanged in Napier on 5 January 1872. His iwi Ngati Rangiwewehi say that the trial had a predetermined outcome and was a miscarriage of justice. Kereopa was posthumously pardoned as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement in 2014.

<text>Eckernförde (; , sometimes also ; , sometimes also ) is a city located in the of Rendsburg-Eckernförde, Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany. Situated on the coast of the Baltic Sea, approximately 30 km north-west of Kiel, it has a population of about 23,000. Eckernförde is a popular tourist destination.

== Name ==
The name of Eckernförde is of mixed origin, but derived from the name of a Danish castle formerly located near the current town, which is also reflected in the name of the town district of &quot;Borby.&quot; This fortification is listed in the 13th century Liber Census Daniæ as &quot;Ykærnæburgh.&quot; In 1441, the town used an official seal listing its name as &quot;Eherneborgh&quot;. The first syllable corresponds to the modern Danish word &quot;egern&quot; meaning &quot;squirrel&quot; while &quot;-förde&quot; is Low German meaning &quot;fjord.&quot; The &quot;-förde&quot; ending is documented in Latinized form on two official seals used by the town in 1602 and 1624. The etymology of the town&#x27;s name is reflected in the presence of a squirrel in the town&#x27;s coat of arms, a feature first documented by the 1441 seal.

== History ==

* In 1197, Eckernförde was mentioned in a written manner for the first time.
* Eckernförde was mentioned in the year 1302 for the first time explicitly as a city, but in 1288 the inhabitants were already called &quot;oppidani&quot; (city citizen).
* In 1628, it was taken by Christian IV of Denmark from the troops of the Holy Roman Empire.
* During the First War of Schleswig two Danish ships, the &quot;Christian VIII&quot; and the frigate tried to land in Eckernförde in April 1849. They were cannonaded from the shore. The &quot;Christian VIII&quot; exploded, while the &quot;Gefion&quot; surrendered and was captured. Theodor Preusser, the commander in chief of the southern troops, died while rescuing Danish troops from the &quot;Christian VIII&quot;.
* On November 13, the 1872 Baltic Sea flood hit the coast of the Baltic Sea from Denmark to Pomerania. Of all the German coastal settlements, Eckernförde was most heavily damaged due to its location on Eckernförde Bay which is wide open to the north-east. The entire town was flooded, 78 houses were destroyed, 138 damaged and 112 families became homeless.
* The Count Saint-Germain was buried in Eckernförde near St. Nicolai Church. His grave was destroyed by the 1872 storm surge.
* In 1934, the seaside resort Borby was incorporated.
* After the Second World War a United Nations displaced persons camp for Estonians was located near Eckernförde, where a section of the Hohenstein mansion was converted into a maternity ward.

<doc id="375348" wikidata="Q718090" url="?curid=375348" title="Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus">
<text>Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus (or Gallaecus or Callaecus; c. 180113 BC) was a consul of the Roman Republic for the year 138 BC together with Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio. He was an optimate politician and a military commander in Hispania and in Illyria. He was the son of Marcus Junius Brutus (consul in 178 BC) and brother of Marcus Junius Brutus (praetor in 88 BC). He had a son also named Decimus Junius Brutus (consul in 77 BC) and his grandson was Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus.

Decimus Junius Brutus belonged to the optimates, a political faction which supported the interests of the aristocracy and was opposed to both the plebeian tribunes (the representatives of the plebs) and populares, a political faction which championed the cause of the poor and wanted reforms to help them. During his consulship he and his colleague P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica opposed the plebeian tribunes. The plebeian tribune Gaius Curiatus sent both consuls to prison because they did not allow the plebeian tribunes to select ten men who would be exempt from military service. The two consuls also opposed a proposal by the tribunes to purchase grain from abroad because the price of grain was going up. Scipio Nasica made a speech which quieted the restless plebs.

==Campaigns in Lusitania and southern Gallaecia==

Appian (who wrongly identified Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus as a praetor called Sextius Junius Brutus) wrote that (in 138 BC) Brutus was sent to the Roman province of Hispania Ulterior (&quot;Further Spain&quot;, in modern Andalusia in the south) to deal with many guerrilla bands which were raiding Lusitania in emulation of Viriathus, the Lusitanian chieftain who led the Lusitanian War (or Fiery War, 155–139 BC) against the Romans and who had been assassinated the year before. The guerrilla bands raided Lusitania, which was between the Rivers Durius (Douro) and Tagus, lying to the north-west of Hispania Ulterior. It covered central and northern parts of present Portugal and also some territory in current western Spain.

Brutus would have been unable to pursue the gangs over an area which ranged from the Rivers Lethe (Limia) and Durius to the River Baetis (Guadalquivir). This was a vast area which extended from Gallaecia, in modern-day north-western Spain and northern Portugal, to the edge of the Roman province of Hispania Ulterior. Therefore, Brutus attacked their towns for revenge, to destroy their homes and for plunder for his army, obliterating everything in his path. Women fought valiantly with their men. Some people fled to the mountains and, when they asked for pardon, Brutus took their belongings as a fine. In 137 BC Brutus crossed the River Durius and therefore crossed into Gallaecia. Brutus also reached the River Lethe, which flows from a source in Galicia close to today&#x27;s border with Portugal and has its outlet on the coast of northern Portugal. Appian wrote that he was the first Roman who thought of crossing it. Lethe was also the name of a mythical river in the underworld, and so the superstitious Roman soldiers refused to cross it until Brutus crossed it himself. Brutus also crossed the Nimis (a river which has not been identified, but was probably the Minho in Galicia, the last tract of which forms part of today&#x27;s northern border of Portugal. He launched an assault against the Bracari, a tribe of southern Gallaecia centred on modern-day Braga, Portugal, because they attacked his baggage train. The fighting women killed themselves and their children when they were captured. A number of towns submitted but then rebelled. One of them was Talabriga. Brutus ordered the inhabitants to hand over the deserters, the prisoners, hostages and their weapons and to leave the town. They disobeyed and he had them surrounded by soldiers to scare them and then took their horses, provisions and public money, but gave them back the town. When he completed his campaign Brutus then returned to Rome.

Brutus must have moved into Lusitania from north of the River Tagus because no crossing of this river was mentioned by Appian. Therefore, he advanced from central Portugal to northern Portugal. He had the city of &quot;Olissipo&quot; (modern Lisbon) fortified. Talabriga (Marnel, near Águeda) must have been taken before the Crossing of the Durius. A fortified position was established at Vissaium (Viseu). As already noted, after devastating Lusitania Brutus also reached into southern Gallaecia.

Cividade de Terroso in the outskirts of modern Póvoa de Varzim, was one of the major cities in the heartland of the native Castro Culture in coastal northern Portugal, which had notable Carthaginian influence in trade and culture. The archaeological site shows clear signs of complete destruction and burning dating to the time of Decimus Junius Brutus. After the destruction the city was rebuilt using some Roman principles.

Decimus Junius Brutus pacified Lusitania and southern Gallaecia. The way the Roman kept suzerainty over the peoples of this area is unclear due lack of information. It is likely that they were forced to become Roman allies like some of the Celtiberian peoples who lived further east. There were further conflicts between the Romans and the Lusitanians later. Lusitania and Gallaecia were annexed into the Roman Empire later, when Augustus reorganised the Roman provinces of Hispania either before or after the Cantabrian Wars of 29–19 BC (in Asturias and Cantabria, to the north of Gallaecia) in which he suppressed the last rebellion against the Romans in the peninsula. Lusitania was established as a new province. Gallaecia became part of Hispania Tarraconensis, a new and larger province which replaced the province of Hispania Citerior to include central and southern Spain.

==Participation in war against the Vaccaei==

In 137 BC Decimus Junius Brutus also got involved in a campaign against the Vaccaei, who lived to the west of the Celtiberians and not far from Lusitania. The commanders of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior (&quot;Nearer Spain&quot;, on the east coast of Spain, roughly corresponding to modern Catalonia and Valencia) were fighting in Numantine War (143–133 BC), a rebellion of the Celtiberians who lived to the west of Hispania Citerior. The war was centred on the town of Numantia, which was difficult to besiege, holding out for ten years. In 137 BC the consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Porcina was sent to Hispania Citerior to continue the war after the Roman senate rejected a peace treaty made by the other consul for the year, Gaius Hostilius Mancinus. Aemilius did not want to keep his army idle while he was waiting for instructions from Rome and was probably greedy for glory and booty. He falsely accused the Vaccaei of aiding the Celtiberians as an excuse for war. He ravaged the countryside and besieged Pallantia, their main city. He convinced Brutus, who was the commander of Hispania Ulterior and his brother-in-law, to join him. Messengers from the senate arrived and asked why Aemilius sought a new war. They warned him not to continue the attacks on the Vaccaei. Aemilius sent them back to Rome and wrote that it would be dangerous to abandon the war. The siege lasted a long time, during which the Romans run short of food and many men and all the animals died. Aemilius and Brutus eventually had to withdraw, doing so in a very disorderly manner. The Pallantines harassed their flanks and rear and killed many men. When Rome heard of this, Aemilius was recalled, stripped of his command and consulship, and fined. Brutus does not seem to have been punished.

==Family==
Callaicus was married to a Clodia (who had previously been married to Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus and had three children with him) and with her had at least two children, a son named Decimus Junius Brutus and a daughter named Junia who became the mother of Gaius Claudius Marcellus.

==Other facts==

The ancient Roman historian Livy wrote that in 138 BC, when Decimus Junius Brutus and his consular colleague, Publius Cornelius Nasica, held the levy of the soldiers, &quot;something happened in front of the recruits that served as an example.&quot; A man was accused before the plebeian tribunes of deserting the army in Hispania. He was sentenced, &quot;sent under the yoke, chastised with rods, and sold for one sesterce.&quot;

In 138 BC Decimus Junius Brutus founded the Roman colony of &quot;Valentia Edetanorum&quot; (today&#x27;s Valencia) in Hispania Citerior. Valentia, which means valour, was named in honour of the valour of the Roman soldiers. Edetanorum indicated that the city was in the territory of the Edetani, an Iberian people. It was built on the site of an Iberian town. Livy said that Valentia was founded to give land to soldiers who had fought under Viriathus, the Lusitanian leader.

In 136 BC the Roman Senate granted Brutus a triumph and gave him the cognomen Callaicus or Callaecus (winner against the Callaeci/Gallaeci) At an unknown date he built a temple by the Circus Flaminius which is thought to have been dedicated to Hercules Callaicus. This was one of various public buildings Callaicus built with the proceeds of the spoils of his war. All of them had inscriptions by Lucius Accius, the tragic poet. He had a colossal statue of a seated Mars erected in this temple.

Brutus was the patron of Lucius Accius, who wrote a tragedy on the tyranny of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome, and his expulsion by Lucius Junius Brutus (the founder of the Roman Republic and an ancestor of Callaecus) titled &quot;Brutus&quot; in honour of his patron.

In 129 BC, according to Livy, Brutus helped the consul Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus, who &quot;at first fought unsuccessfully against the Iapydians [a tribe in Illyria], but the defeat was compensated by a victory won through the qualities of Decimus Junius Brutus.&quot; However, according to Appian, &quot;Sempronius Tuditanus and Tiberius Pandusa waged war with the Iapydes, who live among the Alps, and seem to have subjugated them.&quot; This was the last historical record of Callaicus.

Cicero said that Callaicus had the peculiar habit of performing the libations (the pouring of a liquid as an offering to a god or spirit or in memory of the dead) for the dead in December instead of February as was customary. Plutarch explored a number of possible explanations for this peculiarity: (1) since the dead were honoured at the end of the day, it may be reasonable to do so at the end of the year; (2) it might not be fitting to honour the dead at the beginning of the sowing, a time of new life; (3) December was dedicated to Saturn, who was a god of the underworld; or, (4) that &quot;Brutus deemed it proper to bestow upon the dead first-fruits&quot; of the revelries of the festival of the Saturnalia. Plutarch also wondered whether &quot;this statement, that Brutus alone sacrificed to the dead in this month&quot; was wrong. &quot;For it is in December that they make offerings to Larentia and bring libations to her sepulchre.&quot; Larentia was a mythical woman who was connected to the Lares, the spirits of ancestors who were guardian deities of the family, neighbourhoods, roadways, seaways, agriculture, livestock, towns, cities, and the state.

According to Mastrocinque, in 122 BC Callaicus took part in the suppression of the movement led by Gaius Sempronius Gracchus.

<text>Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus (27 April 81 BC – September 43 BC) was a Roman general and politician of the late republican period and one of the leading instigators of Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassination. He had previously been an important supporter of Caesar in the Gallic Wars and in the civil war against Pompey. Decimus Brutus is often confused with his distant cousin and fellow conspirator, Marcus Junius Brutus.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Decimus was probably son of the Roman senator Decimus Junius Brutus and his notorious wife Sempronia, one of the participants in the conspiracy of Catilina in 63 BC. His birthday seems to have been 27 April, and he was probably born in the year 81 BC, perhaps slightly earlier. Decimus was of distinguished ancestry: his father, grandfather and great-grandfather had all been consuls, and his mother was likely descended from Gaius Gracchus, the ill-fated popular reformer. He was also adopted by a patrician named Postumius Albinus, one of the last members of the ancient noble house which bore that name. Although some ancient sources accordingly refer to Decimus as &#x27;Albinus&#x27;, and the name also appears on some coins he himself minted, Decimus does not seem to have changed his name to reflect the adoption, as was customary, and his contemporaries continued referring to him by his birth name, even in official contexts.

On several occasions Julius Caesar expressed how he loved Decimus Brutus like a son. Syme argued that if a Brutus was the natural son of Caesar, Decimus was more likely than Marcus Brutus. Decimus was named an heir in the second degree in Caesar&#x27;s will and was designated to become guardian of any child Caesar would have. Roman historian Appian interpreted this as being an adoption of Decimus by Caesar.

Decimus Brutus spent his youth mainly in the company of Publius Clodius Pulcher, Gaius Scribonius Curio, and Marcus Antonius.

===During the Wars===

He served in Caesar&#x27;s army during the Gallic wars and was given the command of the fleet in the war against the Veneti in 56 BC. In the decisive Battle of Morbihan, Decimus Brutus succeeded in destroying the Veneti&#x27;s fleet. Using sickle-like hooks fitted on long poles, Decimus Brutus attacked the enemy&#x27;s sails, leaving them immobilized and easy prey to Roman boarding parties. He also served against Vercingetorix in 52 BC.

When the Republican Civil War broke out, Decimus Brutus sided with his commander, Caesar, and was entrusted once again with fleet operations. Richard Billows argued that Caesar loved Decimus Brutus almost as a son. In 50 BC he married Paula Valeria, the sister of Gaius Valerius Triarius, a friend of Cicero who later fought alongside Pompey at Pharsalus.

The Greek city of Massilia (present-day Marseille) sided with Pompey the Great, and Caesar, hastening to reach Hispania and cut Pompey off from his legions, left Decimus Brutus in charge of the naval blockade of Massilia. Within thirty days, Decimus Brutus built a fleet from scratch, defeated the Massilian fleet twice, and together with Gaius Trebonius (who commanded the siege) secured the capitulation of Massilia.

===Ides of March and its aftermath===

When Caesar returned to Rome as dictator after the final defeat of the Conservative faction in the Battle of Munda (45 BC), Marcus Brutus joined the conspiracy against Caesar, after being convinced by Cassius and Decimus. In 44 BC, Decimus was made &quot;Praetor Peregrinus&quot; by personal appointment of Caesar and was designated to be the governor of Cisalpine Gaul in the following year.

On the Ides of March (March 15), Caesar initially decided not to attend the Senate meeting in the curia at the theatre of Pompey due to the concerns of his wife. He was persuaded to attend by Decimus Brutus, who escorted him to the senate house, and neatly evaded Mark Antony, who may have told Caesar of the assassination plot. After Caesar was attacked by the first assassin, Servilius Casca, Decimus and the rest of the conspirators attacked and killed him. In all, Caesar suffered approximately 23 stab wounds. According to Nicolaus of Damascus, Decimus struck him through the thigh.

The assassins received an amnesty the next day, issued by the senate at the instigation of Mark Antony, Caesar&#x27;s fellow consul. But the situation was not peaceful; Rome&#x27;s population and Caesar&#x27;s legionaries wanted to see the conspirators punished. The group decided to lie low, and Decimus used his office of &quot;Praetor Peregrinus&quot; to stay away from Rome. Decimus was named an heir in the second degree in Caesar&#x27;s will.

===Activity in Gallia Cisalpina===

The climate of reconciliation soon passed, and slowly the conspirators were starting to feel the strain of the assassination. Already in March 44 BC, Decimus Brutus found his (earlier) allocation of the province of Cisalpine Gaul opposed by Antony. Nevertheless, by the autumn, Decimus Brutus was campaigning against local tribes in the province assigned to him by Caesar as propraetor, with his own troops. He was ordered by the Senate to surrender his province to Antony but refused, an act of provocation to which Antony was only too happy to respond. Defeating Decimus Brutus was a way for Antony to regain his ascendancy and get control of the strategically important Italian Gaul; while conversely Cicero encouraged the former to destroy Antony and thereby restore the commonwealth.

In 43 BC Decimus Brutus occupied Mutina, laying in provisions for a protracted siege. Antony obliged him, and blockaded Decimus Brutus&#x27; forces, intent on starving them out.

Nevertheless, the consuls of the year, Aulus Hirtius and Gaius Pansa, marched northward to raise the siege. Guided by Cicero (whose &quot;Philippics&quot; date from this time), the Senate was inclined to view Mark Antony as an enemy. Caesar Octavian, the nineteen-year-old heir of Caesar, and already raised to the rank of propraetor, accompanied Gaius Pansa north. The first confrontation occurred on April 14 at the battle of Forum Gallorum, where Antony hoped to deal with his opponents piecemeal. Antony defeated the forces of Gaius Pansa and Octavian, which resulted in Pansa suffering mortal wounds; however, Antony was then defeated by a surprise attack from Hirtius. A second battle on 21 April at Mutina resulted in a further defeat for Antony and Hirtius&#x27; death. Antony withdrew, unwilling to become the subject of a double circumvallation as Vercingetorix had done to Caesar at Alesia.

With the siege raised, Decimus Brutus cautiously thanked Octavian, now commander of the legions that had rescued him, from the other side of the river. Octavian coldly indicated he had come to oppose Antony, not aid Caesar&#x27;s murderers. Decimus Brutus was given the command to wage war against Antony, but many of his soldiers deserted to Octavian.

===Flight and death===
With Cicero&#x27;s support, however, Decimus Brutus crossed the Alps to join Plancus in the war against Antony; but when Plancus switched sides his position became untenable and he was forced to flee. He attempted to reach Macedonia, where Marcus Junius Brutus and Cassius had stationed themselves, but was executed &quot;en route&quot; in mid-September by a Gallic chief loyal to Mark Antony.

Several letters written by Decimus Brutus during the last two years of his life are preserved among Cicero&#x27;s collected correspondence.

==Cultural depictions==

Decimus&#x27; legacy is not as notable as that of the other Brutus who was among the conspirators, Marcus Brutus, whom he is often confused for, or merged with, in depictions.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, Decimus Brutus is mistakenly called &quot;Decius&quot;. He also appears in the play &quot;Cato, a Tragedy&quot; by Joseph Addison also here under the name &quot;Decius&quot;. He appears with his actual name in the play &quot;The Tragedy of Cicero&quot;.

In Allan Massie&#x27;s 1993 book entitled &quot;Caesar&quot;, Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus narrates his story and reason for joining in Caesar&#x27;s assassination while being held captive by the Gallic chief.

In Colleen McCullough&#x27;s novels &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;The October Horse&quot; (of her Masters of Rome series) Decimus Brutus is an important character. In these novels, he and Gaius Trebonius are portrayed as the real leaders of the assassination conspiracy.

In Conn Iggulden&#x27;s &quot;Emperor&quot; series of books the historical figures of Decimus Brutus and Marcus Brutus are blended together into the one character named Marcus Brutus.

In Ben Kane&#x27;s books &quot;The Forgotten Legion&quot;, &quot;The Silver Eagle&quot;, and &quot;Road To Rome&quot;, Decimus Brutus is shown as a fairly major character to the plot and the rest of the book as Fabiola&#x27;s lover.

In Robert Harris&#x27; novel, &quot;Dictator&quot;, it is Decimus, not Marcus, who is the Brutus targeted during Caesar&#x27;s assassination by Caesar&#x27;s alleged accusatory words, &quot;Even you?&quot;. The phrase, more often rendered as &quot;Et tu&quot;, is immortalized in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.

In S.J.A Turney&#x27;s series of novels titled &quot;Marius Mules&quot;, Decimus Brutus is heavily featured as a brilliant naval commander and one of Caesar&#x27;s most loyal officers.

<doc id="375354" wikidata="Q2627355" url="?curid=375354" title="Timequake">
<text>Timequake is a 1997 semi-autobiographical work by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Marketed as a novel, the book was described as a &quot;stew&quot; by Vonnegut, in which he summarizes a novel he had been struggling with for a number of years.

==Plot summary==
Vonnegut uses the premise of a timequake (or repetition of actions) in which there is no free will. The idea of determinism is explored—as it is in many of his previous works—to assert that people really have no free will. Kilgore Trout serves again as the main character, who the author declares as having died in 2001, at the fictitious Xanadu retreat in Rhode Island. Vonnegut explains in the beginning of the book that he was not satisfied with the original version of &quot;Timequake&quot; he wrote (or &quot;Timequake One&quot;). Taking parts of &quot;Timequake One&quot; and combining it with personal thoughts and anecdotes produced the finished product, so-called &quot;Timequake Two&quot;. Many of the anecdotes deal with Vonnegut&#x27;s family, the death of loved ones, and people&#x27;s last words.

The plot, while centered on Trout, is also a sort of ramble in which Vonnegut relays tangents to the plot and comes back dozens of pages later: the timequake has thrust citizens of the year 2001 back in time to 1991 to repeat every action they undertook during that time.

Most of the small stories in the book expound on the depression and sadness wrought by watching oneself make bad choices: people watch their parents die again, drive drunk or cause accidents that severely injure others. At the end of the timequake, when people resume control, they are depressed and gripped by ennui. Kilgore Trout is the only one not affected by the apathy, and thus helps revive others by telling them, &quot;You were sick, but now you&#x27;re well, and there&#x27;s work to do.&quot;

In the conclusion of this book, a fictionalized Vonnegut (who has inserted himself into the text, something he also did in &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; and, to a lesser degree, in &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;) meets other authors for a celebration of Trout. The celebration, described as a &quot;clambake,&quot; is heavily foreshadowed throughout the novel&#x27;s previous chapters.

==Style==
The novel is divided into 63 chapters, seemingly arbitrarily. A new chapter rarely offers any sort of &quot;break&quot; with a previous one; in most cases a thought which was being discussed at the conclusion of the previous chapter continues uninterrupted in the next; chapter breaks are thus used no differently from paragraph breaks.

&quot;Timequake&quot;, like many Vonnegut works, features a large number of double-spaced paragraph breaks and triple asterisks within each chapter, creating a constant sense of the author pausing between paragraphs.

Though his tone is largely cynical throughout &quot;Timequake&quot;, Vonnegut frequently makes use of various light-hearted sayings, such as &quot;Hold on to your hats!&quot; or &quot;Get a load of this!&quot; when segueing between ideas. Several phrases are likewise continually repeated, such as &quot;ting-a-ling&quot; and &quot;he&#x27;s up in heaven now.&quot;

<doc id="375358" wikidata="Q236885" url="?curid=375358" title="Roman dictator">
<text>A Roman dictator was an extraordinary magistrate in the Roman Republic endowed with full authority to resolve some specific problem to which he had been assigned. He received the full powers of the state, subordinating the other magistrates, consuls included, for the specific purpose of resolving that issue, and that issue only, and then dispensing with those powers immediately.

A dictator was still controlled and accountable during his term in office: the Senate still exercised some oversight authority, and the rights of plebeian tribunes to veto his actions or of the people to appeal them were retained. The extent of a dictator&#x27;s mandate strictly controlled the ends to which his powers could be directed. Dictators were also liable to prosecution after their terms completed.

Dictators were frequently appointed from the earliest period of the Republic down to the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), but the magistracy then went into abeyance for over a century. It was later revived in a significantly modified form, first by Sulla between 82 and 79 BC and then by Julius Caesar between 49 and 44 BC, who became just before his death. This later dictatorship was used to effect wide-ranging and semi-permanent changes across Roman society. After Caesar&#x27;s assassination in 44, the office was formally abolished and never revived.

== Traditional dictatorship ==

The reasons for which someone might be appointed dictator were varied. The purpose of the dictatorship was to return Rome to the status quo before some threat emerged. The dictatorship existed &quot;to eliminate whatever had arisen that was out of bounds and then eliminate themselves so that normal operation of the ordinary government&quot; could resume.

===Origin===
The abolition of the Roman monarchy , according to tradition, devolved the royal powers onto two annually elected consuls. The creation of the dictatorship is part of this tradition, which is somewhat confused. Its original title was &quot;magister populi&quot;, &quot;master of the infantry&quot;. His lieutenant was the &quot;magister equitum&quot;, &quot;master of the horse&quot;. The dictator may have also been called the &quot;praetor maximus&quot;, as mentioned by Livy, referring to an old law requiring the &quot;praetor maximus&quot; to put a nail into the wall of a temple on the ides of September.

It is not certain who the first dictator was or in what year he was appointed. Livy gives two versions: in one, the first dictator was Titus Larcius in 501 BC. His other version states that the first dictator was Manius Valerius Maximus, although Livy thought this improbable, as he had not previously been consul and, had a Valerius been desired, Manius&#x27; father, Marcus, who was consul in 505 BC, could have been chosen instead. However, few modern scholars put much faith in these traditional accounts: by the time Roman history started being written down, the dictatorship as a military commander had already lapsed out of living memory.

The dictatorship seems to have been conceived as a way to bypass normal Roman politics and create a short-term magistrate with special powers, serving to defend the Republic in war, or otherwise to cow internal civil unrest, especially if such unrest imperilled the conduct of war. There are broadly two views on the dictatorship&#x27;s origin: that it descends from the Latins, or that it was a uniquely Roman institution.

The Roman view stresses that the dictatorship is said to have existed from the earliest years of the Republic, created as &quot;an integral part of the republican constitution&quot;. And while other Latin cities had dictatorships, they emerged from their abolished monarchies as ordinary magistrates rather than as an extraordinary magistrate only appointed in time of crisis. Others have argued that the dictatorship existed as a means to slip through the inefficiency of a new collegiate magistracy, arguing that the Romans would not have made it – with regal powers – an &quot;integral&quot; part of their constitution in the immediate aftermath of the monarchy&#x27;s abolition, confining it therefore to a peripheral and extraordinary role. Other scholars have advanced theories that the consuls came &quot;after&quot; the dictatorship rather than before.

The Latin view argues that the dictatorship emerged from the need to rotate command between Latin states in the role of commanding the Latin League&#x27;s united armies. While Rome was not a formal member of the League, it did require the Latins to serve in Rome&#x27;s wars under a Roman commander, which could have been a dictator appointed for the occasion. One argument of this is the siege of Veii: for nine years of siege, Rome did not resort to a dictator, until the last year when Etruscan intervention compelled Rome to call in its Latin allies. Moreover, it is plausible that the dictatorship was borrowed from other Latin municipalities that had a &quot;dictator&quot; serving as a military commander. This view also stresses continuity between the Roman kingdom and the succeeding republic, with the dictatorship as a bridge between the two periods.
===Nomination===

The dictator was the only important official in the Roman state that was appointed. The power to appoint a dictator vested in the consuls, one of whom could nominate a man to serve in the office; he did not need to consult his colleague, and no other magistrates had such authority. A dictator, however, could be created by comitial legislation at the proposal of other magistrates, as Sulla and Caesar later were. 

Consular nomination occurred in a nocturnal ritual, usually preceded by advice from the Senate asking for a specific person to be appointed, but this was not strictly necessary. A vote of the people could be held, but this was unusual, perhaps except in cases with a non-consular nominator. In the case of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, the people may have created him dictator directly by legislation. After most attested dictators were ex-consuls; it does not appear, however, that this emerged from any kind of legislation, as implied in Livy, to that effect.

Dictatorial powers likely extended beyond the term of the nominating magistrate, and most dictators are recorded to have given up their powers as quickly as possible. Customary law may have required dictators to give up their powers immediately after completion of their assigned task.

A dictator could be nominated for different reasons, or &quot;causae&quot;. These &quot;causae&quot; were akin to &quot;provinciae&quot;, spheres of command assigned to a magistrate which bound their freedom of action. The various &quot;causae&quot; were:

* &quot;rei gerundae causa&quot;, &quot;for the conduct of the matter&quot;, used for military emergencies,
* &quot;comitiorum habendorum causa&quot;, for holding the &quot;comitia&quot;, or elections, when the consuls were unable to do so;
* &quot;clavi figendi causa&quot;, to create a dictator for an important religious rite involving the driving of a nail into the wall of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, as a protection against pestilence;
* for quelling of sedition;
* for establishing a religious holiday;
* for holding the Roman games, an ancient religious festival;
* for investigating certain actions; and,
* in one extraordinary case, for appointment of senators, after the Battle of Cannae.

These reasons could be combined (e.g., &quot;seditionis sedandae et rei gerundae causa&quot;, for quelling sedition and for war). However, by the middle Republic the historical record clearly shows that dictators were appointed more as temporary extraordinary magistrates to do some very specifically defined action before resigning, acting as proxies or substitutes for the ordinary magistrates of that year; the historicity of the dictators appointed in the early period to quell sedition—who usually took the side of the protestors—is also debated.

The Romans were not consistent in classifying specific threats and then appointing a dictator if they met some criteria. Rather, they judged the matter subjectively such that a dictator in military matters would only be appointed if there were converging threats from multiple enemies, all-consuming ongoing wars, or extinction-level threats to the city which could be handled by a man &quot;whose empowerment with the dictatorship offered more assurance of success than the incumbent magistrates&quot;. Alternatively, dictators might be appointed if another consul-like magistrate was needed.

Normally there was only one dictator at a time, although a new dictator could be appointed following the resignation of another. A dictator could be compelled to resign his office without accomplishing his task or serving out his term if there were found to be a fault in the auspices under which he had been nominated. After nomination, a dictator would have his &quot;imperium&quot; ratified by &quot;comitia curiata&quot;—bringing that matter before the Assembly himself—in a manner akin to that of the consuls.

===Insignia===
Like other curule magistrates, the dictator was entitled to the &quot;toga praetexta&quot; and the &quot;sella curulis&quot;. The dictator, however, was accompanied by twenty-four lictors rather than the normal twelve lictors of the consul. However, within the &quot;pomerium&quot; he may have displayed twelve.

In a notable exception to the Roman reluctance to reconstitute the symbols of the kings, the lictors of the dictator never removed the axes from their fasces, even within the &quot;pomerium&quot;, symbolising their power over life and death and setting the dictator apart from the ordinary magistrates. the lictors of other magistrates could not bear fasces at all when appearing before the dictator.

The Latin theory of the dictatorship&#x27;s origin has also suggested that the twenty-four lictors emerged from the uniting of &quot;two governments&quot;. It may have also simply signalled that a dictator&#x27;s &quot;imperium&quot; was superior to that of the consuls or that he was endowed with the power of both consuls. As the kings had been accustomed to appear on horseback, this right was forbidden to the dictator unless he first received permission from the &quot;comitia&quot;.

===Powers and limitations===

The full extent of the dictatorial power was considerable, but not unlimited. It was circumscribed by the conditions of a dictator&#x27;s appointment, as well as by the evolving traditions of Roman law, and to a considerable degree depended on the dictator&#x27;s ability to work together with other magistrates. The precise limitations of this power were not sharply defined, but subject to debate, contention, and speculation throughout Roman history.

In the pursuit of his &quot;causa&quot;, the dictator&#x27;s authority was nearly absolute. However, as a rule he could not exceed the mandate for which he was appointed; a dictator nominated to hold the &quot;comitia&quot; could not then take up a military command against the wishes of the Senate. Dictators could carry out functions which fell outside the scope of their initial appointments, but only at the direction of the Senate; this included the drawing of funds from the public treasury, which a dictator could only do with the Senate&#x27;s authorisation.

The &quot;imperium&quot; of the other magistrates was not vacated by the nomination of a dictator. They continued to perform the duties of their office, although subject to the dictator&#x27;s authority, and continued in office until the expiration of their year, by which time the dictator had typically resigned. Dictatorial power also did not override that of the tribunes. While some sources assert there was no appeal to the tribunes from a dictator&#x27;s actions, other sources document the extent of a dictator&#x27;s powers within the , appeals against dictatorial action, and threats by tribunes to veto elections held by dictators.

Most authorities hold that a dictator could not be held to account for his actions after resigning his office. However, there are cases where this is asserted in the literary sources and the surviving text of the &quot;lex repetundarium&quot; implies the dictator and his magister equitum could be prosecuted after their terms ended. Rather, some modern scholars hold the position that unaccountability is a &quot;legalistic illusion&quot;.

Some sources, both ancient and modern in summaries of the office, assert that the dictator was limited to a term for six months, but this is contradicted by recorded practice and Livy has a dictator object to a six-month limitation explicitly as objectionably unorthodox.

===Decline and disappearance===

Before the First Punic War starting in 264 BC, when Rome established hegemony over Italy, dictators were overwhelmingly appointed to conduct military campaigns and also appointed regularly. However, these dictators were not given the best commands—they rarely won triumphs: only five of some 75 triumphs between 363 and 264 BC—suggesting that they functioned as substitutes for the ordinary magistrates. The middle Republic also shows significant use of the dictatorship to hold elections in place of consuls: this occurred twelve times during the First Punic War and eight times during the following Second. &quot;Magistri equitum&quot; had a knack of winning elections when held by dictators, which may explain why this limited dictatorship also fell into abeyance. 

In domestic affairs, the dictators were at times—according to tradition—appointed to resolve issue between the patricians and the plebeians during the so-called Conflict of the Orders. In this role, the dictators always took the side of the plebs, implying that the later tradition of the dictatorship as a tool of patrician tyranny is a post-Sullan anachronism. Their efforts may have been decisive in that legislation passed in the Assemblies called by dictators did not need the approval of the Senate, serving to break impasses between an obstinate patrician-heavy Senate and popular demands.

After the Second Punic War and the Third Macedonian War, all major wars were then conducted by promagistrates and usually lasted several years, making the short term of the dictatorship unsuitable. Moreover, the fact that these conflicts occurred far from Rome radically limited the possibility of panicked tumult that could result in a dictatorial appointment. The rise of prorogation also meant that the Romans had, by jettisoning the annual term, more generals in the field than they had in the past. These promagistrates resembled archaic dictators as well, being exempt from normal consular responsibilities while being assigned a limited task—&quot;provincia&quot;—to complete.

At the same time, the new promagistrates also meant the consuls could spend more time in Rome, meaning it became less necessary to appoint dictators to conduct elections. During the various wars of the 140s BC, the ability to have more commanders under praetorian or proconsular leadership meant it was possible to keep at least one consul in Rome while the other fought abroad. Even when the Senate wanted to act against men such as Tiberius Gracchus or Gaius Gracchus, dictators were not appointed: in the former, the consul refused to act, precluding a dictatorial nomination, and in the latter, the Senate authorised the consul to use force via the so-called &quot;senatus consultum ultimum&quot;.

The religious purpose of the dictatorship in undertaking rituals to appease the gods in cases of pestilence or other disasters also was replaced. Dictators appointed to appease the gods was highly reactive but, over time, the accumulation of precedent formalised a spiritual process. Instead of an ad hoc approach, the Senate would advise—in moments of need—consultation of the Sibylline Books and direct implementation of the Books&#x27; recommendations.

==Late republican dictatorship==
The new dictatorships of Sulla and Caesar differed greatly from the traditional dictatorship. The long period of abeyance in which the dictatorship had lain meant that men like Sulla and Caesar were no longer bound by the chains of centuries of tradition requiring any man appointed to the dictatorship—traditionally a man trusted by all Romans—to act for all Romans, resolve the issue to which he was appointed, and then immediately resign.

=== Lucius Cornelius Sulla ===
Following Sulla&#x27;s civil war, Lucius Cornelius Sulla had the dictatorship revived. In 82 BC the consuls were absent from the city, he induced the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot;, called by Lucius Valerius Flaccus as &quot;interrex&quot;, to pass a law directly appointing Sulla as dictator to write laws and reconstitute the state (); he was also given immunity for all actions (including those past and future)

After significant changes to the laws and proscriptions, he completed this task on 1 January 79 BC and resigned to take up an ordinary consulship. This dictatorship aligned with one aspect of the archaic dictatorship—restoring stability—as the state was, in fact, in a shambles after the domination and proscriptions of Lucius Cornelius Cinna, Gaius Marius, and Gnaeus Papirius Carbo. &quot;Sulla never aimed at permanent tyranny&quot;; wishing his settlement to succeed, and conceiving of it in quasi-republican terms, he resigned the dictatorship in place of ordinary magistrates. Sulla&#x27;s reforms and proscriptions did stabilize a republic—albeit on radically reformed grounds with Sulla as a &quot;law-giver&quot; who gave Rome &quot;a new constitution that would put an end to political and social strife&quot;—and restore somewhat free elections for the next few decades, at an enormous cost. But the precedent that he set by twice marching on Rome with his armies would prove an equally destabilizing influence.

=== Between Sulla and Caesar ===

After Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship, there are a few cases where a dictatorship was supposedly considered as a means of effecting regime change.

One version of the supposed First Catilinarian conspiracy (which itself is now held in modern scholarship to be fictitious) related by Suetonius would have had the creation of a dictatorship led by Marcus Licinius Crassus with Julius Caesar as magister equitum. Suetonius&#x27; version of events may be anachronistic, with Crassus and Caesar&#x27;s involvement being an embellishment. Regardless, the suggestion of a dictatorship &quot;belongs, perhaps to a late-republican school of thought that saw the antiquated office of the consulship as an ineffective path to the mastery of Rome&quot; with the dictatorship as an &quot;obvious tool for republican regime change&quot; informed by Sulla&#x27;s proscriptions and reforms. The phraseology of how Crassus would supposedly have been elevated to the dictatorship also suggests it was seen as an available instrument for ambitious factional leaders to force through self-serving change.

The later consulship of Pompey in 52 BC also is reported to have been initially intended as a dictatorship; it was, however, aborted by his election as sole consul (without colleague) to restore order. Scholars disagree as to the reasons why Pompey was made sole consul: ancient sources (Appian, Dio, and Plutarch) all believed this occurred to deny him a dictatorship; &quot;recent scholarship has emphasised Pompey’s consulship rather as a means of resolving a political impasse&quot;. If this were an abortive dictatorship, it would have been &quot;a final echo of the archaic dictators&quot; with the sole goal of restoring order to the city.

=== Caesar ===
Caesar also revived the dictatorship during the Civil War, first to hold the elections—in which he was returned as consul for the following year—and on multiple occasions between October 48 BC and his death in 44. It is unclear which of Caesar&#x27;s acts were undertaken under his overlapping dictatorial, proconsular, consular, or private authority. Unlike the consulship, which was limited by hundreds of years of precedent, the dictatorship, by virtue of its &quot;separat[ion] from its foundations by 120 years of disuse&quot;, as well as Sulla&#x27;s example, offered Caesar a position that gave him vast, ill-defined, and largely unconstrained powers. His dictatorship built on that of Sulla&#x27;s as well: he changed the number of magistracies and reformed the state, but Caesar&#x27;s dictatorship was administrative rather than one given up at the completion of a task. To that end, shortly before his death Caesar had himself appointed &quot;dictator perpetuo&quot;, i.e., in a dictatorship that continued each year without the need to seek the senate&#x27;s approval or appointment by one of the consuls. This new and transformed dictatorship, endowed with a kingly power, ended with Caesar&#x27;s assassination.

==Abolition==

After Caesar&#x27;s death, it became unlawful to propose, vote for, or accept any dictatorship. Any person who became dictator also could be summarily executed. Essentially, the title was cursed and excised from the republican constitution. Curiously, the person who did this was not one of the &quot;liberatores&quot; but rather, Caesar&#x27;s own former magister equitum, Mark Antony. Antony&#x27;s supporters lionised him for having rid the Republic of this instrument of tyranny.

The need for the dictatorship—especially as an instrument of pseudo-royal power—was clearly already gone: in 22 BC, a senatorial delegation begged Augustus to accept the dictatorship, and Augustus refused, knowing that the title would bring only hatred, and that his own informal authority, &quot;encumbered by neither ancient nor recent precedent&quot;, would be sufficient.

==&quot;Magister equitum&quot;==
The dictator&#x27;s lieutenant was the &quot;magister equitum&quot;, or &quot;master of the horse&quot;. The first act of a dictator was to choose this lieutenant, usually at his own discretion. It was customary for the dictator to nominate a magister equitum, even if he were appointed for a non-military reason.

The magister equitum was also a curule magistrate, with powers to summon the Senate and perhaps also powers to summon the Assembly; however, he had only six lictors, symbolizing his subordination to the dictator, and his expectation of quickly vacating office. The magister equitum was necessarily subordinate to the dictator, although this did not always prevent the two from disagreeing.

In theory, the magister equitum was commander of the cavalry, but he was not limited to that role. The dictator and magister equitum did not always take the field together; in some instances the magister equitum was assigned the defense of the city while the dictator took an army into the field, while on other occasions the dictator remained at Rome to see to some important duty, and entrusted the magister equitum with an army in the field.

<doc id="375359" wikidata="Q463108" url="?curid=375359" title="The Neverending Story">
<text>The Neverending Story () is a fantasy novel by German writer Michael Ende, published in 1979. The first English translation, by Ralph Manheim, was published in 1983. It was later adapted into a film series and a television series, &quot;The NeverEnding Story: The Animated Adventures of Bastion Balthazar Bux&quot;.

==Plot==
The book centres on a boy, Bastian Balthazar Bux, an overweight and imaginative child who is neglected by his father after the death of Bastian&#x27;s mother. While escaping from some bullies, Bastian bursts into the antiquarian book store of Carl Conrad Coreander, where he finds his interest held by a book called &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;. Unable to resist, he steals the book and hides in his school&#x27;s attic, where he begins to read.

The story Bastian reads is set in the magical land of Fantastica, a place of wonder ruled by the benevolent and mysterious Childlike Empress. A great delegation has come to the Empress to seek her help against a formless entity called &quot;The Nothing&quot;. The delegates are shocked when the Empress&#x27;s physician, a centaur named Cairon, informs them that the Empress is ill, and has chosen a boy warrior named Atreyu to find a cure. Upon finding Atreyu, Cairon gives him AURYN: a powerful amulet that protects him from all harm. At the advice of the giant turtle Morla the Aged One, Atreyu sets off in search of an invisible oracle known as Uyulala, who may know the Empress&#x27;s cure. In reaching her, he is aided by a luckdragon named Falkor, whom he rescues from the shapeshifting creature Ygramul the Many. By Uyulala, he is told the only thing that can save the Empress is a new name given to her by a human, who can only be found beyond Fantastica&#x27;s borders.

Through reading the story, Bastian becomes increasingly disturbed by hints that the characters are somehow aware that he is reading their adventures, being able to hear or even see him at points. As Falkor and Atreyu search for the borders of Fantastica, Atreyu is flung from Falkor&#x27;s back in a confrontation with the four Wind Giants and loses AURYN in the sea. Atreyu lands in the ruins of Spook City, the home of various creatures of darkness. Wandering the dangerous city, Atreyu finds the werewolf Gmork, chained and near death, who tells him that all the residents of the city have leapt voluntarily into The Nothing. There, thanks to the irresistible pull of the destructive phenomenon, the Fantasticans are becoming lies in the human world. The wolf also reveals that he is a servant of the force behind The Nothing and was sent to prevent the Empress&#x27;s chosen hero from saving her. Gmork then reveals that when the princess of the city discovered his treachery against the Empress, she imprisoned him and left him to starve to death. When Atreyu announces that he is the hero Gmork has sought, the wolf laughs and succumbs to death. When approached, Gmork&#x27;s body instinctively seizes Atreyu&#x27;s leg in his jaws, preventing him from escaping The Nothing. Meanwhile, Falkor retrieves AURYN from the sea and arrives in time to save Atreyu from the rapid approach of The Nothing.

Falkor and Atreyu go to the Childlike Empress, who assures them they have brought her rescuer to her; Bastian suspects that the Empress means him, but cannot bring himself to believe it. When Bastian refuses to speak the new name, to prompt him into fulfilling his role as savior, the Empress herself locates the Old Man of Wandering Mountain, who possesses a book also entitled &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;, which the Empress demands he read aloud. As he begins, Bastian is amazed to find the book he is reading is repeating itself, beginning once again whenever the Empress reaches the Old Man — only this time, the story begins with Bastian&#x27;s meeting with Coreander, his theft of the book, and all his actions in the attic. Realizing that the story will repeat itself forever without his intervention, Bastian names the Empress &quot;Moon Child&quot;, and appears with her in Fantastica, where he restores its existence through his own imagination. The Empress has also given him AURYN, on the back of which he finds the inscription &quot;Do What You Wish&quot;.

For each wish, Bastian loses a memory of his life as a human. Unaware of this at first, Bastian goes through Fantastica, having adventures and telling stories, while losing his memories. In spite of the warnings of Atreyu and Bastian&#x27;s other friends, Bastian uses AURYN to create creatures and dangers for himself to conquer, which causes some negative side effects for the rest of Fantastica, such as the rampage of the dragon &quot;Smerg&quot; and the birth of the Shlamoofs, winged insane clown creatures. After being abetted by the wicked sorceress Xayide, and with the mysterious absence of the Childlike Empress, Bastian decides to take over Fantastica as emperor. During his coronation ceremony he is stopped by Atreyu, whom Bastian grievously wounds in a battle so fierce it results in the destruction of the Ivory Tower. Bastian then enters &quot;The City of Old Emperors&quot;, inhabited by human beings who came to Fantastica earlier but could not find their way out, eking out a meaningless existence there. Ultimately, a repentant Bastian is reduced to two memories: that of his father, and of his own name. After more adventures, Bastian must give up the memory of his father to discover that his strongest wish is to be capable of love and to give love to others.

After much searching, and having lost his final pre-Fantastican memory (his name and knowledge of himself), Bastian is unable to find the Water of Life with which to leave Fantastica with his memories. After an attack by the Shlamoofs he is rescued by Atreyu. Of his own volition, Bastian lays down AURYN at his friend&#x27;s feet, and Atreyu and Falkor enter AURYN with him, where the Water of Life demands to know Bastian&#x27;s name, and if Bastian has finished all the stories he began in his journey, which he has not. Only after Atreyu gives Bastian&#x27;s name and promises to complete all the stories for him does the Water of Life allow Bastian to return to the human world, along with some of the mystical waters. After drinking the Water of Life, Bastian returns to his original form, and feels comfortable and happy with it. He returns to his father, where he tells the full tale of his adventures, and thus his father is restored from his grief. Afterward, Bastian confesses to Coreander about stealing his book and losing it, but Coreander denies ever owning such a book. He reveals he has also been to Fantastica, that the book has likely moved into the hands of someone else and that Bastian—like he did—will eventually show people the many ways to Fantastica.

==Editions==
&quot;The Neverending Story&quot; was first published under the title &quot;Die unendliche Geschichte&quot; in 1979 by West German publisher Thienemann Verlag. It was number one on West Germany&#x27;s highly respected &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; bestseller list for 113 weeks, and remained on the list for 332 weeks. The original edition was printed using red and green text: red writing to represent the story lines which take place in the human world, and green writing to represent the events taking place in Fantastica. The illustrations by Roswitha Quadflieg that begin each chapter are drawn in both colors to illustrate how the two worlds intertwine. It was initially only printed as a hardcover, not paperback, because Ende wanted the book to look as much as possible like the book that Bastian steals from Mr. Coreander in the story.

The English version, translated by Ralph Manheim, was published simultaneously in the United Kingdom and United States in 1983. Several other English-language editions have since been published, with a variety of covers and lettering styles. As of 2010, &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; has been translated into 36 languages, and sold more than eight million copies worldwide.

In 1998 &quot;Der Niemandsgarten&quot; (English: &quot;The No Man&#x27;s Garden&quot;) was published. This anthology of Michael Ende&#x27;s unpublished works includes insight on the creation of &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; and has been translated into Japanese but not English. Also unavailable in English is &quot;Aber das ist eine andere Geschichte – Das große Michael Ende Lesebuch&quot; (English: &quot;But that is Another Story: The Big Michael Ende Reader&quot;), which contains the previously unpublished chapter &quot;Bastian erlernt die Zauberkunst&quot; (English: &quot;Bastian learns the art of magic&quot;).

==Reception==
A survey conducted by German filmmaker Ulli Pfau found that &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; appeals particularly to readers aged 18–35. It remains most successful in Germany and Japan, while the 1984 film tends to be better-known among English-speaking audiences.

Early reviews of the English-language edition included positive reviews in &quot;Library Journal&quot; and &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, the latter calling &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; an &quot;appealing, delicately wrought, engrossing adventure—for children of all ages&quot;. A less positive review in gaming magazine &quot;White Dwarf&quot; took issue with the appearance of the physical book, writing that &quot;despite plush production the artwork is grotty, while the promised &#x27;shimmering copper-coloured silk&#x27; binding looks like plain red cloth to me. A good buy, though, unless you suffer from red/green colour blindness&quot;.

In subsequent years the text of &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; has been analyzed from several different viewpoints. In &quot;The Rhetoric of Character in Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, literary critic Maria Nikolajeva states that &quot;the two parts of the novel repeat each other&quot; in that Bastian becomes a hero but then in the second half he &quot;acts not even as an antihero but as a false hero of the fairy tale&quot; and the characters of Bastian and Atreyu can also be seen as mirror halves. Helmut Gronemann&#x27;s &quot;Fantastica—the Realm of the Unconscious&quot; explores the novel from a Jungian point of view, identifying archetypes and symbols in the story. Additionally, some religious groups have analyzed the text for occult messages and imagery.

==Adaptations and derivative works==
===Music===
* The album &quot;Wooden Heart&quot; by Listener was based on or heavily influenced by &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;, as has been confirmed by the band. Different songs represent different ideas of the plot or characters, which can be seen on the band&#x27;s lyric page for the album.
* The Spanish indie rock band Vetusta Morla derived its name from the ancient turtle in the novel, and the Spanish boyband Auryn derived its name from the medallion given to Atreyu and Bastian.
* The metalcore band Atreyu also derives its name from a character in &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;.
* The band Bayside released a song called &quot;They Looked Like Strong Hands&quot; on their self titled album in 2005, referencing the speech Rockbiter gives to Atreyu.
* The hip-hop artist Homeboy Sandman references Atreyu and Falkor in his 2019 song &quot;Far Out&quot;.
* British pop singer Limahl sang the English version of the song on the soundtrack of the film in 1984.

===Audiobook===
* A German dramatized audioplay under the title &quot;Die unendliche Geschichte&quot; (Karussell/Universal Music Group 1984, directed by Anke Beckert, music by Frank Duval, 3 parts on LP and MC, 2 parts on CD).
* In March 2012 Tantor Media released an unabridged audiobook of &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; narrated by Gerard Doyle.

===Film===

&quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; was the first film adaptation of the novel. It was released in 1984, directed by Wolfgang Petersen and starring Barret Oliver as Bastian, Noah Hathaway as Atreyu, and Tami Stronach as the Childlike Empress. It covers only the first half of the book, ending at the point where Bastian enters Fantastica (renamed &quot;Fantasia&quot; in the film), and features characters who look markedly different from how they are described in the book (most notably Bastian, who is very self-conscious about his weight in the book, but is depicted as slender in the film). Ende, who was reportedly &quot;revolted&quot; by the film, requested they halt production or change the film&#x27;s name, as he felt it had ultimately and drastically deviated from his novel; when they did neither, he sued them and subsequently lost the case.

&quot;The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter&quot;, directed by George T. Miller and starring Jonathan Brandis and Kenny Morrison, was released in 1990. It used plot elements primarily from the second half of Ende&#x27;s novel, but told a new tale. Ende has dismissed both the 1984 film and its 1990 sequel as &quot;gigantic melodrama made of kitsch and commerce, plush and plastic&quot;.

&quot;The NeverEnding Story III&quot;, directed by Peter MacDonald and starring Jason James Richter, Melody Kay and Jack Black, was released in 1994 in Germany. This film was primarily based only upon the characters from Ende&#x27;s book but had an original story. The film was lambasted by film critics for its poor and laughable dialogue and special effects and was a box-office bomb. In addition, the US release went straight to video and received a limited theatrical run in 1996.

In March 2024, Michael Ende Productions, in association with See-Saw Films, announced plans for a series of films based on the book.

===Novels===
From 2003 to 2004, the German publishing house AVAinternational published six novels of different authors in a series called &quot;Legends of Fantastica&quot;, each using parts of the original plot and characters to compose an entirely new storyline:

===Stage===
The world première of the stage production took place in 2012 in Brisbane, Australia, by the Harvest Rain Theatre Company.

In Germany, &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; has been variously adapted to a stage play, ballet and opera, which premiered both at Trier and at Weimar Nationaltheater on 10 April 2004, and was subsequently staged at Linz Landestheater on 11 December. The scores to both the opera and the ballet versions were composed by Siegfried Matthus. The opera libretto was by Anton Perry.

In Canada, the novel was adapted to stage for the Stratford Festival for the 2019 season adapted by David S. Craig with original music by Hawksley Workman.

===Television===
The 1995 animated series was produced by Canadian animation studio Nelvana, under the title of &quot;The Neverending Story: The Animated Adventures of Bastian Balthazar Bux&quot;. The animated series ran for two years, and had a total of twenty-six episodes. Director duties were split between Marc Boreal and Mike Fallows. Each episode focused on Bastian&#x27;s further adventures in Fantastica, largely different from his further adventures in the book, but occasionally containing elements of them.

&quot;Tales from the Neverending Story&quot;, a one-season-only TV series that is loosely based on Ende&#x27;s novel, was produced in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, through December 2000 to August 2002 and distributed by Muse Entertainment, airing on HBO in 2002. It was aired as four two-hour television movies in the US and as a TV series of 13 one-hour episodes in the United Kingdom. The series was released on DVD in 2001.

===Google Doodle===
On 1 September 2016, a Google Doodle created by Google artist Sophie Diao commemorated the first publication of the work, on the 37th anniversary.

===Video games===
Ocean Software released a text adventure in 1985 for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit computers.

A video game based on the second film was released in 1990 by Merimpex Ltd under their Linel label and re-released by System 4 for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.

The Ende-inspired video game &quot;AURYN Quest&quot; was released in 2002.

<text>The Battle of the Standard, sometimes called the Battle of Northallerton, took place on 22 August 1138 on Cowton Moor near Northallerton in Yorkshire, England. English forces under William of Aumale repelled a Scottish army led by King David I of Scotland.

King Stephen of England, fighting rebel barons in the south, had sent a small force (largely mercenaries), but the English army was mainly local militia and baronial retinues from Yorkshire and the north Midlands. Archbishop Thurstan of York had exerted himself greatly to raise the army, preaching that to withstand the Scots was to do God&#x27;s work. The centre of the English position was therefore marked by a mast (mounted upon a cart) bearing a pyx carrying the consecrated host and from which were flown the consecrated banners of the minsters of York, Beverley and Ripon: hence the name of the battle. This cart-mounted standard was a very northerly example of a type of standard common in contemporary Italy, where it was known as a carroccio.

King David had entered England for two declared reasons: 
*To support his niece Matilda&#x27;s claim to the English throne against that of King Stephen (married to another niece)
*To enlarge his kingdom beyond his previous gains.

David&#x27;s forces had already taken much of Northumberland apart from castles at Wark and Bamburgh.

Advancing beyond the Tees towards York, early on 22 August the Scots found the English army drawn up on open fields north of Northallerton; they formed up in four &#x27;lines&#x27; to attack it. The first attack, by unarmoured spearmen against armoured men (including dismounted knights) supported by telling fire from archers, failed. Within three hours, the Scots army disintegrated, apart from small bodies of knights and men-at-arms around David and his son Henry. At this point, Henry led a spirited attack with mounted knights; he and David then withdrew separately with their immediate companions in relatively good order. Heavy Scots losses are claimed, in battle and in flight.

The English did not pursue far; David fell back to Carlisle and reassembled an army. Within a month, a truce was negotiated which left the Scots free to continue the siege of Wark castle, which eventually fell. Despite losing the battle, David was subsequently given most of the territorial concessions he had been seeking (which the chronicles say he had been offered before he crossed the Tees). David held these throughout the Anarchy, but on the death of David, his successor Malcolm IV of Scotland was soon forced to surrender David&#x27;s gains to Henry II of England.

Some chronicle accounts of the battle include an invented pre-battle speech on the glorious deeds of the Normans, occasionally quoted as good contemporary evidence of the high opinion the Normans held of themselves.

==Background==
David had gained the Scottish throne largely because of the support of his brother-in-law Henry I of England, and he had attempted to remodel Scotland to be more like Henry&#x27;s England. He had carried out peaceful changes in the areas of Scotland over which he had effective control and had conducted military campaigns against semi-autonomous regional rulers to reassert his authority; in administration, in warfare, and in the settling of regained territory, he had drawn on the talent and resources of the Anglo-Norman lands. The death of Henry I in 1135, weakening England, made David more reliant on his native subjects, and allowed him to contemplate winning control over substantial areas of northern England.

Henry I had wished his inheritance to pass to his daughter Matilda, and in 1127 made his notables swear an oath to uphold the succession of Matilda (David was the first layman to do so). Many of the English and Norman magnates and barons were against Matilda because she was married to Geoffrey V, count of Anjou. On Henry&#x27;s death, Stephen, younger brother of Theobald, count of Blois, seized the throne instead.

When Stephen was crowned on 22 December, David went to war. After two months of campaigning in northern England, a peace treaty ceding Cumberland to David was agreed. Additionally, David&#x27;s son Henry was made Earl of Huntingdon, David declining to swear the required oath of loyalty to Stephen, since he had already sworn allegiance to Matilda.

In spring 1137, David again invaded England: a truce was quickly agreed. In November, the truce expired; David demanded to be made earl of the whole of the old earldom of Northumberland. Stephen refused and in January 1138 David invaded for a third time.

== Campaigning in 1138 before the battle ==

===David invades Northumberland===
David first moved against English castles on the Tweed frontier. Norham Castle belonged to the Bishop of Durham and its garrison was under-strength; it quickly fell. Having failed to rapidly seize the castle at Wark on Tweed, David detached forces to besiege it and moved deeper into Northumberland, demanding contributions from settlements and religious establishments to be spared plunder and burning.

===Scots slave-raiding and Anglo-Norman alarm===
The actions of the army that invaded England in early 1138 shocked the English chroniclers. Richard of Hexham records that:

Monastic chroniclers often deplore depredations made by foreign armies and sometimes even those of their own rulers but some Scots forces were going beyond normal Norman &#x27;harrying&#x27; by systematically carrying off women and children as slaves.

In contemporary Britain, this was regarded as a useful source of revenue, like (and not significantly more reprehensible than) cattle-raiding.

The practicalities of this would support the chroniclers&#x27; tales of sexual abuse of the slaves and casual slaughter of unsalable encumbrances:
 
In February, King Stephen marched north with an army to deal with David. David successfully evaded him, and Stephen returned south.

===Scots raid into Craven and the Battle of Clitheroe===
In the summer, David&#x27;s nephew William fitz Duncan marched into Yorkshire and harried Craven; on 10 June, he met and defeated an English force of knights and men-at-arms at the battle of Clitheroe. He also destroyed the recently founded Calder Abbey in Copeland. The choice of targets has no obvious strategic logic; it may be pertinent that William eventually inherited both the Honour of Skipton in Craven, and the Lordship of Copeland, previously held by his father-in-law William de Meschines and which should have passed to him on the death of William de Meschines&#x27; son Ranulph Meschin, the founder of Calder.

===Peace feelers fail; David enters Yorkshire===
By late July David had crossed the river Tyne and was in &quot;St Cuthbert&#x27;s land&quot; (the lands of the Bishop of Durham). With him were contingents from most of the separate regions of his kingdom, amounting to more than 26,000 men (many sources say this is wrong, that it was more like 16,000). Eustace fitz John had declared for David and handed over to him Alnwick Castle in Northumberland. The garrison of Eustace&#x27;s castle at Malton to the North East of York began to raid surrounding areas in support of David (or Matilda).
The magnates of Yorkshire gathered in York to discuss the worsening crisis:Archbishop Thurstan of York (who, as will presently appear, greatly exerted himself in this emergency), William of Aumale, Walter de Gant, Robert de Brus, Roger de Mowbray, Walter Espec, Ilbert de Lacy, William de Percy, Richard de Courcy, William Fossard, Robert de Stuteville
Much irresolution was caused by distrust of each other, arising from suspicions of treachery, by the absence of a chief and leader of the war (for their sovereign, king Stephen, encompassed by equal difficulties in the south of England, was just then unable to join them), and by their dread of encountering, with an inadequate force, so great a host However, urged by the 70-year-old Thurstan (&#x27;Lieutenant of the North&#x27; in addition to his ecclesiastical duties; Walter Espec was High Sheriff of Yorkshire), to stand and fight and if needs be die in a holy cause, they agreed to gather their forces and return to York, where they were joined by reinforcements from Nottinghamshire under William Peverel and Geoffrey Halsalin, and from Derbyshire led by Robert de Ferrers. They advanced to Thirsk, from where they sent Robert de Brus and Bernard de Balliol (recently arrived with a few mercenaries sent by King Stephen) on an embassy to David, whose army was now approaching the River Tees and North Yorkshire.

The emissaries promised to obtain the earldom of Northumberland for Henry, if the Scots army withdrew. Ailred of Rievaulx gives de Brus a speech in which he tells David that the English and the Normans have always been his true friends (against the Gaels), and without their help he may not be able to keep his kingdom together. Whatever was initially said, it ended in hard words being exchanged. Having failed to persuade David to withdraw, the emissaries returned to Thirsk, with de Brus angrily withdrawing his homage to David. David&#x27;s forces crossed the Tees and moved south. The English forces moved northwards and took up a defensive position to the north of Northallerton.

===Battlefield and English dispositions===
Moving south from the Tees David&#x27;s army would have had the high ground of the North Yorkshire Moors on its left, and the River Swale on its right. Nearing Northallerton, the distance between hills and river is about , much of it low-lying and (then) poorly drained. The road to Northallerton from the Tees (the Great North Road) therefore approaches the town along a ridge of slightly higher ground running north–south. Minor ups and downs break the line of sight along the ridge, but the &#x27;ups&#x27; are hills only in relation to the low ground on either side of the ridge. The English army deployed across this ridge about north of Northallerton in a single solid formation with the armoured men and most of the knights (who had dismounted, and sent their horses to the rear) to the front supported by the archers and the more lightly equipped men of the local levies. The barons stood with the remaining dismounted knights at the centre of the line around the standard. Their left is thought to have straddled the road, with its flank protected by a marsh; it is not known if the low ground to the east of the ridge was similarly boggy, or if the English formation extended that far.

===Scots arrive and deploy===
John of Worcester says that David intended to take the English by surprise, there being a very close mist that day. Richard of Hexham says simply that the Scots became aware of the standard (and by implication the army underneath it) at no great distance.

Ailred of Rievaulx gives the eventual deployment of the Scots as being in four &#x27;lines&#x27;. The Galwegians [from Galloway in south-west Scotland]described by a later chronicler as &quot;men agile, unclothed, remarkable for much baldness [shaven heads?]; arming their left side with knives formidable to any armed men, having a hand most skillful at throwing spears and directing them from a distance; raising their long lance as a standard when they advance into battle&quot;were in the first line. &quot;The second line the King&#x27;s son Prince Henry arranged with great wisdom; with himself the knights and archers, adding to their number the Cumbrians and Teviotdalesmen ... The men of Lothian formed the third rank, with the islanders and the men of Lorne [in the South-West Highlands]. The King kept in his own line the Scots and Moravians [men from Moray in North-East Scotland]; several also of the English and French knights he appointed as his bodyguard.&quot;

Henry of Huntingdon&#x27;s account of the battle would imply that the men of Lothian with their &#x27;long spears&#x27; were in the first line; however, the generally accepted view is that the long spears were those of the Galwegians.

===Scots argue===
Ailred says (but this may be a literary device) that this order of battle was decided at the last minute; David had intended to attack first with his knights and armoured men-at-arms, but had faced strong protests from the Galwegians that they should be given the honour of attacking first, since they had already demonstrated at Clitheroe that the vigour of their attack was sufficient to rout Normans in armour. David, however, paid more attention to the counter-argument of his Normans; that if the Galwegians failed the rest of the army would lose heart. The Galwegians resumed their protest, and the debate was not aided by a &quot;mormaer&quot; (one of David&#x27;s native &#x27;great lords&#x27;) asking why David listened to &#x27;foreigners&#x27; when none of those with armour on would this day outdo the mormaer who wore no armour. And Alan de Percy, base-born son of the great Alana most vigorous knight, and in military matters highly distinguishedtook these words ill; and turning to the earl he said, &#x27;A great word hast thou spoken, and one which for thy life thou canst not make good this day.&#x27;
Then the king, restraining both, lest a disturbance should suddenly arise out of this altercation, yielded to the will of the Galwegians.

===Anglo-Normans orate===
Both Ailred and Henry of Huntingdon report a speech made to the Anglo-Normans before battle was joined. The speech may well be a literary device of the chroniclers, to present the reasons why it was fit and proper that the Normans should win, rather than accurate reportage of an actual speech. Ailred of Rievaulx says the speech was made by Walter Espec, Sheriff of York (and founder of Rievaulx). Henry of Huntingdon and after him Roger of Hoveden say the speech was made by Radulf Novell, bishop of Orkney as the representative of Thurstan.

The speaker first reminds the Normans of the military prowess of their race (especially when compared to the Scots):

He next assures them that God has chosen them to punish the Scots:

Any keenness of the Scots to attack is because they don&#x27;t understand the superiority of Norman equipment:

Furthermore, the Scots&#x27; advantage in numbers is no advantage at all, especially when they are up against properly trained Norman knights:

These preliminaries over, the battle began.

== Battle ==
=== Galwegian attack is held and fails ===
The battle began with a charge by the Galwegian spearmen who

The English archery caused disorganisation and heavy casualties in the Scottish ranks. Ailred records the bravery and determination of the Galwegians, together with its ineffectiveness:

The Galwegians finally fled after the death of two of their leaders (Domnall and Ulgric); the men of Lothian similarly broke after the earl of Lothian was killed by an arrow

===The King retreats; Prince Henry attacks===
David wished to stand and fight, but was forced onto his horse and compelled to retire by his friends. Ailred simply says that the English were advancing; Henry of Huntingdon says that David&#x27;s &#x27;line&#x27; had been progressively melting away.
Prince Henry led mounted men in a charge on the Anglo-Norman position, as or just after the Scots foot broke. According to Ailred, Henry successfully broke through and attacked the horse-holders in the rear of the Anglo-Norman position; the &#x27;unarmed men&#x27; (i.e. unarmoured men) were dispersed, and only rallied by a claim that the Scottish king was dead. Since Prince Henry was unsupported and the rest of the army was withdrawing, for the most part in great disorder, he hid any banners showing his party to be Scottish, and retreated towards David by joining the English pursuing him. Henry of Huntingdon is keener to stress Henry&#x27;s inability to shake the armoured men; again the attack ends in flight:

===Scots&#x27; rout and casualties===
The battle lasted no longer than between prime and terce, i.e. between daybreak and mid-morning. In Northern England at the end of August sunrise is roughly 6 a.m. and hence the battle lasted no more than 3½ hours; by not long after 9 a.m. all elements of the Scottish army were in retreat or flight. No numbers are given for total English losses but they are said to have been light; of the knights present, only one was killed. Scottish casualties during the battle proper cannot be separated from losses whilst fleeing in the 10 or so hours of daylight remaining. The chroniclers talk variously of the fugitives scattering in all directions, of their attempting to cross the Tees where there was no ford and drowning, of their being found and killed in cornfields and woods, and of fighting between the various contingents. Richard of Hexham says that of the army which came forth from Scotland, more than ten thousand were &quot;missing&quot; from the re-mustered survivors. Later chroniclers built upon this to claim 10–12,000 Scots &quot;killed&quot;. John of Worcester gives more details on the fortunes of the Scots knights

==Aftermath==
===End of the campaign===
David regrouped his forces at Carlisle; the nobles of Yorkshire did not move North against him, and their local levies dispersed to their homes rejoicing at the victory. Thus, although militarily the battle was a &quot;shattering defeat&quot;, it did not reverse David&#x27;s previous gains. David had the only army still under arms and was left to consolidate his hold on Cumberland and Northumberland.
On 26 September Cardinal Alberic, bishop of Ostia, arrived at Carlisle where David had called together his kingdom&#x27;s nobles, abbots and bishops. Alberic was there as a papal legate to resolve a long-running dispute as to whether the bishop of Glasgow was subordinate to the archbishop of York. However, Alberic also addressed more temporal matters: he persuaded David to refrain from further offensive action until Martinmas (11 November) whilst continuing to blockade Wark to starve it into submission, and the &#x27;Picts&#x27; to (also by Martinmas) return their captives to Carlisle and free them there.At Martinmas, the garrison of Wark surrendered on the orders of the castle&#x27;s owner (Walter Espec), conveyed by the abbot of Rievaulx. The garrison had eaten all but two of their horses; King David rehorsed them and allowed them to depart with their arms.

===Another peace agreement===
Negotiations between David and Stephen continued over the winter months, and on 9 April David&#x27;s son Henry and Stephen&#x27;s wife Matilda of Boulogne met each other at Durham and agreed a settlement. Henry was given the earldom of Northumberland and was restored to the earldom of Huntingdon and lordship of Doncaster; David himself was allowed to keep Carlisle and Cumberland. However, Stephen was to retain possession of the strategically vital castles of Bamburgh and Newcastle, and Prince Henry was to perform homage for his English lands, while David himself was to promise to &quot;remain loyal&quot; to Stephen at all times. Stephen released those who held fiefs in the lands Henry now held to do homage to Henry, saving only their fealty to Stephen.

===Northern England under Scottish rule===
This arrangement lasted for nearly 20 years, and would appear to have been beneficial to both sides. David was able to benefit from the resources of Northern England (for example, the lead mines of the northern Pennines gave him silver from which he was able to strike his own coinage). Northern England did not become involved in the civil war between supporters of Stephen and those of Matilda, although magnates with holdings further south were drawn in. This included David, who despite his promise to Stephen was a loyal supporter of Matilda, but he did not go South with a Scottish army.
The new southern border of David&#x27;s realm appeared to be permanently secured in 1149, when Matilda&#x27;s son Henry was knighted by David at Carlisle he having first given an oath that, if he became king of England, he would give to [David] Newcastle and all Northumbria, and would permit him and his heirs to possess in peace without counter-claim for ever the whole land which lies from the river Tweed to the river Tyne.

===Status quo restored===
However, Prince Henry died in 1152, King David in 1153, and King Stephen in 1154. This brought to the throne of Scotland a 14-year-old Malcolm IV of Scotland now facing a young Henry II of England who had at his command the resources not only of an England free from civil war, but also of much of Western France. In 1157, Malcolm travelled to Chester to do homage to Henry who declared that &quot;the king of England ought not to be defrauded of so great a part of his kingdom, nor could he patiently be deprived of it ...&quot;

== Significance of the battle ==
The battle did not stop David achieving his declared war aims. We now know that achieving those aims while England was in turmoil did not prevent all David&#x27;s gains having to be surrendered when Henry II made the Scottish monarch an offer he could not refuse. Unless David had other undeclared aims and ambitions which defeat at the Standard thwarted, therefore, the battle had no long-term significance.

==In historical fiction==
* In Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1820), Cedric the Saxon refers to this battle and describes it as &quot;a day of cleaving of shields, when a hundred banners were bent forwards over the heads of the valiant, and blood flowed round like water, and death was held better than flight.&quot;
* George Shipway gives a fictional account of the Battle of the Standard in his 1969 novel &quot;Knight in Anarchy&quot;.
* In his 1983 novel &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot;, Nigel Tranter places his hero, Somerled, in the vanguard of the Scottish charge.

<text>Jeannette Dorothea Louise Charles (née Clark; 15 October 1927 – 2 June 2024) was a British actress noted for her portrayals of Queen Elizabeth II, branding her &quot;the Queen&#x27;s most famous lookalike&quot;.

==Background==
Jeannette Clark was born in Marylebone, London, in 1927. Her father, Alfred, was a restaurateur, and her mother, who was born Yetta Wonsoff, was a Dutch immigrant originally from Poland. Clark was noted for her resemblance to then-Princess Elizabeth as early as age eleven. 

She had always aspired to an acting career, but could not afford the cost of attending Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. When appearing in theatrical plays, she had trouble getting audiences to overlook her similarity to Elizabeth. She instead became an au pair in the United States, living in Midland, Texas, in the early 1950s. While there, she met Ken Charles, a fellow British expat who was working as an oil engineer; they married in 1957 and lived across North America, South America, and Africa as part of his job, before returning to the United Kingdom from Libya in 1969.

==Career==
Charles and her family settled in Essex. In 1972, a painting she commissioned of herself in her forties (as a present for her husband) was displayed by the artist at the Royal Academy in London, where it was taken to be a portrait of the Queen. On the assumption the painting was of the Queen, it was disqualified as portraits displayed in the Academy had to be painted from life and it was assumed Elizabeth had not sat for the portrait. When it was revealed the portrait was of Charles and not Elizabeth, Charles (as the actual subject of the painting) received a great deal of press attention. She started receiving offers to portray the Queen in print advertisements.

After studying the Queen&#x27;s voice, as well as her appearance, Charles began making in-character personal appearances at trade shows and corporate events, and soon broadened into film. Charles played the role of Queen Elizabeth II in many films including &quot;Secrets of a Superstud&quot; (1976), &quot;Queen Kong&quot; (1976), The Rutles&#x27; movie &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; (1978), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot; (1985), &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; (1988) and &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot; (2002). Foreign governments hired her to stand in for the Queen during preparations for state visits, to allow officials to rehearse protocol.

Charles was a monarchist and refused offers she felt would be disreputable to the Queen as well as herself, such as declining to pose for a &quot;Playboy&quot; centrefold. Once, when invited to an event in which Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother would also be present, she did not agree to appear until she received confirmation from Clarence House that the Queen Mother would not be offended. 

Charles also appeared as a semi-regular in Spike Milligan&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; series on BBC Television and appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Big Brother 10&quot; to surprise the Brazilian contestant Rodrigo Lopes (who thought he was meeting the real Queen Elizabeth II for a task).

Charles also appeared in &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode Season 2, Episode 20 in 1977 and &quot;Mind Your Language&quot; episode Season 2, Episode 2, &quot;Queen for a Day&quot;, in 1978. She published a memoir in 1986.

==Later life and death==
Charles retired in 2014, and lived in Danbury, Essex. She died in a Great Baddow care home on 2 June 2024, at the age of 96. Her husband Ken, with whom she had three children, had died in 1997.
