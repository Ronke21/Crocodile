<text>Rodolfo Usigli (November 17, 1905 – June 18, 1979) was a Mexican playwright, essayist and diplomat. He has been called &quot;the father of Mexican theater&quot; and &quot;playwright of the Mexican Revolution.&quot; In recognition of his work to articulate a national identity for Mexican theater, he was award the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes (Mexican National Prize for Arts and Sciences) in 1972.

==Biography==
Usigli was born to an Italian father and a Polish mother in Mexico City. In his early childhood, he enjoyed many plays that his parents took him to. His father aspired him to go to music school, and Usigli spent a year in the National Conservatory of Music before deciding that his real passion was theater. He studied drama at the Yale School of Drama from 1935-1936 on a Rockefeller scholarship, later becoming a professor and diplomat. It was during his time as a diplomat in 1945 that he met George Bernard Shaw in London. After returning to Mexico from the U.S., he established the Midnight Theater and also became a member of the literary circle that formed around the journal Contemporary. During the 1930s, he directed radio dramas.

== Theatre ==
Usigli’s theater focuses largely the history of Mexico and satirizing his contemporary Mexican society, and how the Mexican middle classes were betrayed, politically and socially, by the Mexican revolution. His plays reflect a sense of the hypocrisies of life after the revolution, both criticizing society and offering models to emulate. He called for a national theater movement that would reflect the truth of the Mexican experience and express the Mexican spirit.

He is perhaps best known for his 1938 play &quot;El gesticulador (The Imposter)&quot;, which critiqued social issues ravaging Mexico, such as misuse of power that the bureaucracy had got from the Revolution of 1910. The play was censored by the Mexican government banned, raising Usigli&#x27;s reputation.

In 1942 Usigli published another work of scathing quality. In &quot;Family Dinner at Home&quot;&#x27; his intended target were the apex strata of the Mexican social structure. Usigli experimented with crime fiction in the novel, &quot;Ensayo de un crimen&quot; (&quot;Rehearsal for a Crime&quot;), which in 1955 was adapted into a film, The Criminal Life of Archibaldo de la Cruz, by Luis Buñuel. Usigli also wrote several essays on history, art and theater. He was also an occasional poet, writing modest but interesting poems.

The award-winning Usigli believed the objective of theatre was to tell the truth about society. He was known for his strong representation of women in plays.

Usigli designed strong female characters in several of his plays. Two of Usigli&#x27;s protégées, Rosario Castellanos and Luisa Josefina Hernández, became important female voices on the Mexican stage. He was also a strong influence on his pupil Jorge Ibargüengoitia and on Josefina Niggli.

== Archive ==
The Rodolfo Usigli Archive in the Walter Havighurst Special Collections at Miami University of Ohio is a repository of Usigli&#x27;s papers. The Archive&#x27;s website describes it as &quot;the definitive research collection relating to Usigli&#x27;s life and career, including correspondence, both manuscript and typed drafts of original plays and translations of works by other artists, personal, theatrical, and diplomatic photographs, essays, books, playbills, posters, theses written about Usigli, awards, newspaper and magazine articles, memorabilia, and ephemera.&quot;

<text>Homonhon Island is an island in the province of Eastern Samar, Philippines, on the east side of Leyte Gulf. The long island is part of the municipality of Guiuan, encompassing eight barangays: Bitaugan, Cagusu-an, Canawayon, Casuguran, Culasi, Habag, Inapulangan, and Pagbabangnan.

Mantoconan, an islet just off the northwest corner of Homonhon, is also part of the approximately 7,500 islands comprising the Philippine Archipelago. The island is one of the early Pacific contact sites between the East and the West.

==History==
During the first circumnavigation of the globe, Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s three surviving vessels passed the Marianas, but did not land, even though he was out of food after crossing the Pacific Ocean. Yet he landed on the island of Homonhon on March 16, 1521. Despite Homonhon being uninhabited at that time, he was detected by the fishing boats of nearby local settlements in Suluan. The local leaders arrived in more boats, receiving him warmly and trading food and supplies with Magellan&#x27;s crew. Magellan later left for Limasawa Island.

Up to the early Spanish period, Ibabaonon (bygone term for Bisaya of the eastern and northern Samar coast) revered the island as the sacred residence of Makapatag, the male aspect of the supreme diwata Malaon.

==Barangays==

<text>Nancy Josephine Kassebaum Baker (; born July 29, 1932) is an American retired politician from Kansas who served as a member of the United States Senate from 1978 to 1997. She is the daughter of Alf Landon, who was Governor of Kansas from 1933 to 1937 and the 1936 Republican nominee for president, and the widow of former U.S. senator and diplomat Howard Baker.

With her victory in the 1978 U.S. Senate election in Kansas, Kassebaum entered the national spotlight as the only woman in the U.S. Senate, and as the first woman to represent Kansas. She was also the first woman ever elected to a full term in the Senate without her husband having previously served in Congress.

In her three terms in the Senate, Kassebaum demonstrated a political independence that made her a key figure in building bi-partisan coalitions in foreign affairs and domestic policy. As chair of the Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs, she played a limited role in legislation to sanction the racist apartheid regime in South Africa. The legislation which was enacted in 1986, over a presidential veto, was drafted by Senators Lugar, Roth, McConnell, and Dole, although later in life, Kassebaum claimed credit for it. As chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, she led the fight for major health care reforms that, for the first time, assured health insurance coverage for people changing jobs with pre-existing medical conditions.

==Early life and education==
Nancy Josephine Landon was born in Topeka, Kansas on July 29, 1932, the daughter of Kansas First Lady Theo (née Cobb) and Governor Alf Landon. She attended Topeka High School, and graduated in 1950. She graduated from the University of Kansas in Lawrence in 1954, where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta, and where she met her first husband, John Philip Kassebaum. They were married in 1955. In 1956, she received a master&#x27;s degree in diplomatic history from the University of Michigan. They settled in Maize, Kansas, where they raised four children.

She worked as vice president of Kassebaum Communications, a family-owned company that operated several radio stations. Kassebaum also served on the Maize School Board. In 1975, she and Philip were legally separated; their divorce became final in March 1979. Kassebaum worked in Washington, D.C., as a caseworker for Senator James B. Pearson of Kansas in 1975, but returned to Kansas the following year.

==Career==

=== Elections ===
In late 1977, Senator Pearson announced he would not seek re-election to a third full term. The unexpected announcement of a rare open seat immediately drew a flood of candidates into the 1978 Republican primary, including two highly respected state senators, three successful businessmen, three others, and Nancy Kassebaum.

At the time that she entered the race, Kassebaum was legally separated from her husband, Philip, but not yet divorced. She chose to use the name Nancy Landon Kassebaum, to capitalize on her father&#x27;s political reputation in the state. She defeated eight other Republicans in the 1978 primary elections to replace retiring Republican James B. Pearson, and then defeated former Democratic representative William R. Roy (who narrowly lost a previous election bid to Kansas&#x27;s junior senator, Bob Dole, in 1974) in the general election. For the rest of her political career, she was primarily known as Nancy Kassebaum. She was re-elected to her Senate seat in 1984 and 1990, but did not seek re-election in 1996.

=== Tenure ===

==== Key issues ====
From the start of her Senate tenure, Kassebaum defied stereotypes, voting moderate to liberal on most social issues, but conservative on federal spending and government mandates. She helped lead an unsuccessful bi-partisan effort to curb soaring federal deficits in the early years of the Reagan administration. But she developed a reputation as a centrist broker, with significant impact on key issues in both foreign policy and domestic affairs.
Kassebaum is known for her health care legislation, known as the Kennedy–Kassebaum Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which was co-sponsored by U.S. senator Ted Kennedy from Massachusetts, a Democrat. She was also active in foreign policy. She expressed strong support of anti-apartheid measures against South Africa in the 1980s.
==== Foreign relations ====
In 1981, Kassebaum became chair of the Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs, and entered the growing controversy surrounding the policy of apartheid — racial segregation and discrimination — in South Africa. She issued a public call for President Reagan and other Republicans to toughen U.S. policy toward the white minority government in Pretoria.

Although President Reagan condemned apartheid, he strongly opposed economic sanctions, despite growing pressure from Congress, including Kassebaum and senator Richard Lugar (R-IN), the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. To break the impasse, the two senators joined key Democrats in supporting targeted sanctions against the South African government, setting specific anti-apartheid goals and conditions, including a demand that South Africa release African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela from prison.

The bi-partisan legislation, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, passed the House and Senate by overwhelming margins, but was then vetoed by President Reagan, forcing Kassebaum and Lugar into a major battle against the president and leadership of their own party. On September 29, 1986, the House voted 315-to-84 to override Reagan&#x27;s veto. The Senate followed suit three days later, and, on a 78-to-21 vote, passed the bi-partisan sanctions bill into law.

In March 1982, Kassebaum headed a U.S. delegation to observe national elections in El Salvador, where the U.S.-backed military junta was battling leftist guerrillas, while being unable to control human rights abuses by government forces and far-right paramilitary groups. The heavy turnout on Election Day convinced Kassebaum that the leftists lacked popular support.

Kassebaum became a key member of bi-partisan efforts to support the Salvadoran government with economic and military aid, while pressuring the government on human rights, land reforms, and more effective steps to prevent a guerrilla victory. She repeatedly urged the Reagan administration to set a clear policy for a political solution to the civil war, while avoiding deeper U.S. military involvement in the region.

==== Domestic policy ====
When Republicans won control of Congress in the 1994 elections, Kassebaum became chair of the Senate Labor Committee, with broad jurisdiction over federal domestic policy. One of her first actions was to introduce health insurance reform legislation, co-sponsored by the committee&#x27;s senior Democrat, Sen. Ted Kennedy. The bill focused on helping some 25 million workers get, and keep, health insurance coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions, even when changing, or losing, a job.

In a year of heated debate, Kassebaum found herself at times opposing amendments from fellow Republicans, including her Kansas colleague, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, and pressuring Kennedy and Democrats to reach compromises. As a result, House and Senate conferees ultimately settled on a final version of the legislation, known as the Kassebaum-Kennedy Act, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The legislation passed overwhelmingly in both houses, and was signed into law by President Clinton, on August 21, 1996.

In her last months in the Senate, Kassebaum also won passage of a new law preserving a beautiful tract of Kansas tallgrass prairie in the national park system. After more than 50 years of controversy, the idea of a Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve became a reality just two months before Kassebaum left office. The new preserve covers 10,876 acres in the heart of the Flint Hills, with its native limestone house, barn and school. Under Kassebaum&#x27;s bill, signed into law by President Clinton, the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve is the only NPS unit dedicated to preserving and providing public access to untamed tallgrass prairie that once covered more than 400,000 square miles of the American heartland.

==== Other issues ====
Early in her career, Kassebaum was tapped to serve as Temporary Chairman of the 1980 Republican National Convention. Presiding over the first two days of the convention, her appointment to that role was seen by many as a nod from the Reagan campaign to the moderate and liberal wings of the party. In 1991, Kassebaum was mentioned by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as a possible running mate for President George H. W. Bush if Vice President Dan Quayle was not the Republican vice-presidential candidate in the 1992 United States presidential election.

Kassebaum voted for the successful Supreme Court nominations of Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer. She voted for the nomination of Robert Bork, which was rejected by the Senate. Kassebaum later expressed regret for voting to confirm Thomas to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1991, expressing disappointment in his performance. The year after the hearings, she noted, &quot;I was never once asked by anyone at the White House or by any of my colleagues about how I reacted to Anita Hill&#x27;s public allegations of sexual harassment, or how I thought the allegations should be handled.&quot;

Kassebaum voted against a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed Congress and the states to ban or restrict abortions.

Kassebaum voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto).

Prior to completing her third term, on December 7, 1996, Kassebaum married former U.S. Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee, who retired from the U.S. Senate after serving three terms in 1985, and included terms as both majority and minority leader.

== Post-political career ==
Kassebaum was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1996.

After leaving the Senate, Kassebaum served on the Board of Trustees for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Kaiser Family Foundation. She was Chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the George C. Marshall Foundation and the American-Turkish Council. Senator Kassebaum also served on the Board of Directors of the National Committee on US-China Relations, the African Law Institute Council-ABA, and the International Medical Corps.

Kassebaum remained active on issues such as campaign finance reform. She served on the Americans for Campaign Reform Advisory Committee, and in 1997 President Clinton asked Kassebaum and former Vice President Walter Mondale “to assist in the cause of bipartisan campaign finance reform.” Their work resulted in recommendations to revamp campaign finance laws that was delivered to Congress in October.

In 2000, Kassebaum was appointed as Co-Chair of The Presidential Appointee Initiative Advisory Board, a Brookings Institution commission that delivered reform recommendations to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

From 2001 to 2005, Senator Baker served as the United States Ambassador to Japan and Kassebaum accompanied him to Japan, living in Tokyo during this time. Kassebaum was recognized for her work with Baker in Japan, including organizing a regional conference in Tokyo to combat human trafficking in Asia in 2004.

Kassebaum is an Advisory Board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. She is also a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

She is a noted critic of former President Donald Trump. In 2018, she, alongside other incumbent and former Republican politicians, endorsed Laura Kelly, the Democratic candidate and eventual victor, in the 2018 Kansas gubernatorial election. She also endorsed Kelly&#x27;s successful reelection in 2022. Kassebaum also endorsed Republican-turned-Democrat Barbara Bollier for the 2020 Senate election in Kansas over her Republican opponent Roger Marshall. In 2014, Kassebaum expressed support for same-sex marriage. In 2024, she endorsed Kamala Harris for president.

== Awards ==
Kassebaum was awarded an honorary doctorate from Kansas State University in 2015.[new citation] Kansas State University also offers the Kassebaum Scholarship, to recognize students who aspire to careers in public service, and up to five students receive this award annually. Her ties to Kansas State University date from 1966, when the Landon Lecture Series on Public Issues was inaugurated as a tribute to her father, former Kansas Gov. Alfred Landon. Her four children are also Kansas State University alumni.

Kassebaum was honored by the Native Sons and Daughters of Kansas as Distinguished Kansas in 1978, and she received it Citation for Distinguished Statesmanship in 2000.

In 1985, Kassebaum received the Distinguished Service Citation from her alma mater, University of Kansas.

In 1996, she was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership.

In January 2025 Kassebaum was one of twenty recipients of the Presidential Citizens Medal. President Biden cited her bipartisan work in the United States Senate, especially on health care reform.

== Personal life ==
In 1955, Kassebaum married John Philip Kassebaum, and they had four children. They separated in 1975, and divorced in March 1979.

She then married former U.S. Senator and Diplomat Howard Baker of Tennessee on December 7, 1996. After leaving Tokyo in 2005 at the end of his appointment as U.S. Ambassador to Japan, they split time between his home in Huntsville, Tennessee, and her home in Burdick, Kansas. Baker died on June 26, 2014.

Her son, William Kassebaum, is a former member of the Kansas House of Representatives. Her other son, filmmaker Richard Kassebaum, died of a brain tumor August 27, 2008, at the age of 47.

<text>Margaret Livingston (born Marguerite Livingston; November 25, 1895 – December 13, 1984), sometimes credited as Marguerite Livingstone or Margaret Livingstone, was an American film actress and businesswoman during the silent film era. She is remembered today as &quot;the Woman from the City&quot; in F. W. Murnau&#x27;s 1927 film &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Livingston was born in Salt Lake City, Utah to John Livingston, a Scottish immigrant, and Eda Livingston (née Frome), who was born in Stockholm, Sweden. She was raised in Salt Lake City along with her older sister, Ivy, who also became a film actress.
==Career==
The young Livingston made her debut in films in 1916. She made over 50 films during the &quot;silent era,&quot; most notably in F.W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans&quot;, and a further 20 films after she successfully made the transition to sound film in 1929, including &quot;Smart Money&quot; starring Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney. She occasionally dubbed voices for some other actresses, including Louise Brooks for &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot; (1929).

Livingston was a guest on William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s yacht the &quot;Oneida&quot; during the weekend in November 1924 with film director and producer Thomas Ince, who later died of heart failure. In the Peter Bogdanovich film &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Meow&quot; (2001), Livingston, played by Claudia Harrison, is depicted as having an affair with Ince at the time of his death.

==Later life==
On August 18, 1931, Livingston married the band leader Paul Whiteman in a ceremony in Denver, Colorado. She retired from film acting in 1934. Livingston was unable to have children, and adopted four with her husband. She spent the remainder of her life investing in oil ventures and real estate, and was a partner in the construction of the Colonial House in West Hollywood, California.

==Death==
Livingston died in Warrington, Pennsylvania on December 13, 1984, at age 89.

<text>Margaret Stratford Livingstone is the Takeda Professor of Neurobiology in the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School in the field of visual perception. She authored the book &quot;Vision and Art: The Biology of Seeing&quot;. She was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2015 and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2020.

== Education and career ==
Livingstone was born in Virginia, started college at Duke University and then transferred to Massachusetts Institute of Technology where she received her undergraduate degree in 1972. In 1981 she earned her Ph.D. from Harvard University. Following her Ph.D. she worked as a visiting fellow at Princeton University and then was a postdoctoral fellow under David H. Hubel at Harvard University. In 1983 she became an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, and in 1988 she was promoted to professor, and in 2014 she was named the Takeda Professor of Neurobiology.

== Research ==
Livingstone&#x27;s early research was on neurons that respond to serotonin, which she conducted by using lobsters as a model organism. She went on to examine the visual responses in cats, monkeys, and how primates sense color. Her research provides insight into how mammals perceive form and movement, the physiological details leading to dyslexia, and the region of the brain used to identify faces.

==Allegations of animal cruelty==
In 2022, following Livingston&#x27;s election as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, she published an inaugural article in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; titled &quot;Triggers for Mother Love&quot;, in which she described the reactions of monkey mothers to being given a stuffed toy after the removal of their baby. This drew attention to her research on vision with monkey infants, which included suturing the eyelids of two monkeys shut.

In response, a group of over 250 scientists sent a letter to the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; to request retraction of the article. PETA also asked for retraction of the article, and asked that Livingston&#x27;s work be defunded. In a response statement, Harvard Medical School defended the value of Livingston&#x27;s work.

In 2023, members of the Animal Law &amp; Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School and the Wild Mind Labs at the University of St. Andrews wrote a letter, signed by over 380 researchers, asking the National Institute of Health to stop funding Livingstone&#x27;s research with monkeys.

== Awards and honors ==
In 2011, the Society for Neuroscience awarded Livingstone the Mika Salpeter Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2015 she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 2020 she was elected to the United States&#x27; National Academy of Sciences. In 2024 she shared the Rosenstiel Award with Winrich Freiwald, Nancy Kanwisher, and Doris Tsao, for their work on how the brains of humans and other primates respond to faces.

<doc id="382941" wikidata="Q161891" url="?curid=382941" title="1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)">
<text>The 1st Airborne Division was an airborne infantry division of the British Army during the Second World War. The division was formed in late 1941 during the Second World War, after the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, demanded an airborne force, and was initially under command of Major General Frederick A. M. &quot;Boy&quot; Browning. The division was one of two airborne divisions raised by the British Army during the war, with the other being the 6th Airborne Division, created in May 1943, using former units of the 1st Airborne Division.

The division&#x27;s first two missions—Operation Biting, a parachute landing in France, and Operation Freshman, a glider mission in Norway—were both raids. Part of the division was sent to North Africa at the end of 1942, where it fought in an infantry role during the Tunisian campaign over the next few weeks, and when the Allies invaded Sicily in July 1943, the division undertook two brigade sized landings. The first, Operation Ladbroke, carried out by glider infantry of the 1st Airlanding Brigade and the second, Operation Fustian, by the 1st Parachute Brigade, were far from completely successful. The 1st Airborne Division then took part in a mostly diversionary amphibious landing, codenamed Operation Slapstick, as part of the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943.

In December, most of the 1st Airborne Division (minus the 2nd Parachute Brigade, left behind in Italy) returned to England, and began training and preparing for the Allied invasion of Normandy. It was not involved in the Normandy landings in June 1944, being held in reserve. In September 1944 the 1st Airborne took part in Operation Market Garden. The division, with the Polish 1st Parachute Brigade temporarily attached, landed behind German lines, to capture crossings on the River Rhine, and fought in the Battle of Arnhem. After failing to achieve its objectives, the division was surrounded and took very heavy casualties, but held out for nine days before the survivors were evacuated.

The remnants of the 1st Airborne Division returned to England soon after. The division never fully recovered from their losses at Arnhem and the 4th Parachute Brigade was disbanded. Just after the end of the war in Europe, the depleted formation took part in Operation Doomsday in Norway in May 1945. They were tasked with the disarmament and repatriation of the German occupation army. The 1st Airborne Division then returned to England and was disbanded in November 1945.

==Background==
Inspired by the success of German airborne operations during the Battle of France, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a force of 5,000 parachute troops. As a result, on 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando assumed parachute duties, and on 21 November was re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing.

On 21 June 1940 the Central Landing Establishment was formed at Ringway airfield near Manchester. Although tasked primarily with training parachute troops, it was also directed to investigate the use of gliders to transport troops into battle. At the same time, the Ministry of Aircraft Production contracted General Aircraft Ltd to design and produce a glider for this purpose. The result was the General Aircraft Hotspur, which was capable of transporting eight soldiers and was used for both assault and training purposes.

The success of the first British airborne raid, Operation &quot;Colossus&quot;, prompted the War Office to expand the airborne force through the creation of the Parachute Regiment, and to develop plans to convert several infantry battalions into parachute and glider battalions. On 31 May 1941, a joint army and air force memorandum was approved by the Chiefs-of-Staff and Winston Churchill; it recommended that the British airborne forces should consist of two parachute brigades, one based in England and the other in the Middle East, and that a glider force of 10,000 men should be created.

==Formation history==
The existing 11th Special Air Service Battalion was renamed the 1st Parachute Battalion on 15 September 1941, and, together with the newly raised 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, formed the first of the new airborne formations, the 1st Parachute Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Richard Gale, who would later command the 6th Airborne Division from 1943 to 1944. The 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions were formed from volunteers, between the ages of nineteen and forty, who were already serving in infantry units. Only ten men from any one unit were allowed to volunteer. Paratroops were paid an extra 2/- per day.
In October 1941, Brigadier Frederick Arthur Montague &quot;Boy&quot; Browning was promoted to major general, named the Commander Parachute and Airborne Troops, and ordered to form a headquarters to develop and train airborne forces. The next unit formed was the 1st Airlanding Brigade on 10 October 1941, by the conversion of the mountain warfare trained 31st Independent Infantry Brigade Group, commanded by Brigadier George Frederick &quot;Hoppy&quot; Hopkinson, later to command the division. The brigade comprised four battalions: the 1st Border Regiment, 2nd South Staffordshire Regiment, 2nd Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry, and the 1st Royal Ulster Rifles. The men who were unsuitable for airborne forces were replaced by volunteers from other units. By the end of the year Browning&#x27;s command had become the headquarters of 1st Airborne Division.

Browning expressed his opinion that the force must not be sacrificed in &quot;penny packets&quot;, and urged the formation of a third brigade. Permission was granted, and on 17 July 1942, the 2nd Parachute Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Ernest Down, who would later succeed Hopkinson in command of the division, was formed. The 2nd Parachute Brigade was assigned the existing 4th Parachute Battalion, and two new battalions converted from line infantry units, the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion, converted from the 7th Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders, and the 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion, from the 10th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers.

The 3rd Parachute Brigade was formed in November 1942 and assigned to the 1st Airborne Division. The brigade, under Brigadier Alexander Stanier, comprised the 7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion, previously the 10th Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry, the 8th (Midlands) Parachute Battalion, converted from the 13th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, and the 9th (Eastern and Home Counties) Parachute Battalion, formerly the 10th Battalion, Essex Regiment.

Soon afterwards, the 1st Parachute Brigade left the division, to take part in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa and ended up participating in numerous operations in North Africa, including three parachute operations, although it was more often fighting in an infantry role.

In April 1943, the commander of the 1st Airlanding Brigade, Hopkinson, was promoted to major general and given command of the division in succession to Browning. Later that year, the division was deployed to Tunisia for operations in the Mediterranean theatre. The 3rd Parachute Brigade and two battalions from the 1st Airlanding Brigade—the 1st Ulster Rifles and 2nd Ox and Bucks—remained behind in England, forming the nucleus of the new6th Airborne Division.

The 1st Airborne Division was reinforced by the 4th Parachute Brigade, that had been formed in the Middle East during 1942. In addition to the 156th Parachute Battalion, which had been raised from British troops stationed in India, it comprised the 10th and 11th Parachute Battalions, which had been raised from troops based in Egypt and Palestine.
The division took part in two brigade sized operations in the Allied invasion of Sicily, and an amphibious assault at Taranto in the Allied invasion of Italy. During the fighting in Italy, Major General Ernest Down became the divisional commander, after his predecessor, Major General Hopkinson, died of wounds received in the fighting. After brief service in Italy, the division returned to England in December 1943, leaving the 2nd Parachute Brigade behind as an independent formation.

After the division arrived in England, Down was posted to India to oversee the formation of the 44th Indian Airborne Division, and was replaced by Major General Roy Urquhart. In September 1944, for Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands, the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade was attached to the division. Following &quot;Market Garden&quot;, fewer than 2,200 men from the 10,000 that were sent to the Netherlands returned to the British lines.

Having suffered such severe casualties, the 4th Parachute Brigade was disbanded, with its survivors being posted to the 1st Parachute Brigade. The division then went through a period of reorganisation, but had still not fully recovered by the end of the war, due to the acute shortage of manpower throughout the British Army in 1944–1945. Still under strength in May 1945 with the End of World War II in Europe, it was sent to Norway to disarm the German army of occupation; returning to Britain in November 1945 where the 1st Airborne Division was disbanded.

==Operational history==
===France===
Operation Biting, also known as the Bruneval Raid, was the codename for a raid by Combined Operations in 1942. Their objective was a German Würzburg radar installation at Bruneval in France. Due to the extensive coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect the array, it was thought a commando raid from the sea would incur heavy losses, and give the garrison sufficient time for the radar equipment to be destroyed. It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by sea-borne evacuation would be the ideal way to surprise the garrison and seize the technology intact.
On the night of 27 February, &#x27;C&#x27; Company, 2nd Parachute Battalion, under the command of Major John Frost, parachuted into France a few miles from the installation. The force then proceeded to assault the villa in which the radar equipment was kept, killing several members of the German garrison and capturing the installation after a brief fire-fight.

A technician that had come with the force partially dismantled the &quot;Würzburg&quot; radar array and removed several key pieces to take back to Britain; the raiding force then retreated to the evacuation beach. The detachment assigned to clear the beach had failed to do so, however, and another brief fire-fight was required to eliminate the Germans guarding the beach. The raiding force was then picked up by a small number of landing craft and transferred to several Motor Gun Boats which brought them back to Britain. The raid was entirely successful. The airborne troops suffered only a few casualties, and the pieces of the radar they brought back, along with a German radar technician, allowed British scientists to understand German advances in radar and to create counter-measures to neutralise those advances.

===Norway===
Operation Freshman was the first British airborne operation conducted using gliders, its target was the Vemork &quot;Norsk Hydro&quot; chemical plant in Norway, which produced heavy water for Nazi Germany. By 1942 the German atomic weapons programme had come close to being able to develop a nuclear reactor, but in order for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water. The source of this water was the Norsk Hydro plant, which had been occupied in 1940; when the British government learned of the German nuclear developments, it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water. Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical, and it was finally decided that a small force from the 1st Airborne Division, comprising 30 sappers from 9 Field Company RE (Airborne), Royal Engineers, would land by glider a short distance from the plant, and demolish it with explosives.

Two aircraft, each towing one glider, left Scotland on the night of 19 November 1942. All managed to reach the Norwegian coast, but none were able to reach their objective. The first pair suffered from navigational difficulties and severe weather, which resulted in the tow rope snapping and the first glider crash-landing, with its towing aircraft returning to base; eight airborne troops were killed outright, four were severely injured and five unhurt. The survivors were captured shortly after the crash. The second pair fared even worse, with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons; the aircrew and several men were killed outright, and those who survived were taken prisoner. None of the prisoners survived for very long, being either poisoned or executed as a result of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Commando Order, which stated that all British Commandos personnel were to be killed immediately when captured.

===Sicily===

Operation &quot;Turkey Buzzard&quot;, also known as Operation &quot;Beggar&quot;, was a supply mission to North Africa that took place between March and August 1943. The mission was undertaken by the division&#x27;s glider pilots and No. 295 Squadron Royal Air Force, as part of the preparations for the invasion of Sicily. The mission involved Halifax bombers towing Horsa gliders from England to Tunisia. The Horsas were needed to complement the smaller American Waco gliders, which did not have the capacity required for the planned operations. During the mission two German Condor patrol aircraft located and shot down a Halifax-and-Horsa combination. Altogether five Horsas and three Halifaxes were lost, but 27 Horsas arrived in Tunisia in time to participate in the invasion of Sicily.
Operation Ladbroke was a glider assault by the 1st Airlanding Brigade near Syracuse, that began on 9 July 1943 as part of the invasion of Sicily. The brigade were equipped with 144 Waco and six Horsa gliders. Their objective was to land near the town of Syracuse, secure the Ponte Grande Bridge, and ultimately take control of the city itself with its strategically important docks.

On the way to Sicily, 65 gliders were released too early by the towing aircraft and crashed into the sea, drowning around 252 men. Of the remainder, only 87 men arrived at the Pont Grande Bridge, which they successfully captured and held beyond the time they were to be relieved. Finally, with their ammunition expended and only 15 soldiers remaining unwounded, they surrendered to the Italian forces. The Italians sought to demolish the bridge after regaining control of it, but were unable to do so because the airborne forces had removed the explosive charges. Other troops from the airlanding brigade, who had landed elsewhere in Sicily, destroyed communications links and captured artillery batteries.

Operation Fustian, the division&#x27;s second mission in Sicily, was carried out by the 1st Parachute Brigade. Their objective was the Primosole Bridge across the Simeto River. The intention was for the parachute brigade, with glider-borne forces in support, to land on both sides of the river. While one battalion seized the bridge, the other two battalions would establish defensive positions to the north and south. They would then hold the bridge until relieved by the advance of XIII Corps, part of the Eighth Army which had landed on the southeastern coast three days previously.

The start of the operation was a disaster. Many of the aircraft carrying the paratroopers from North Africa were shot down, or were damaged and turned back, due to both friendly fire and enemy action. The evasive action taken by the pilots scattered the brigade over a large area, and only the equivalent of two companies of troops were landed in the correct locations. Despite this and the defence by German and Italian forces, the British paratroops captured the bridge. Resisting attacks from the north and south, they held out against increasing odds until nightfall.

The relieving force led by the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, which was short of transport, found it hard going to reach the parachute brigade and were still away when they halted for the night. By this time, with casualties mounting and supplies running short, the brigade commander, Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, had relinquished control of the bridge to the Germans. The following day the British units joined forces, and the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry with armour support attempted to recapture the bridge. It was not finally secured until three days after the start of the operation, when another battalion of the Durham Light Infantry, led by the paratroopers, established a bridgehead on the northern bank of the river.

===Italy===
Operation &quot;Slapstick&quot; was an amphibious landing at the Italian port of Taranto, part of the invasion of Italy in September 1943. The mission had been planned at short notice, following an offer by the Italian government to open the ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the heel of Italy to the Allies. The 1st Airborne Division was selected to undertake the mission, but at the time they were located in North Africa. A shortage of transport aircraft meant the division could not land by parachute and glider, and all the landing craft in the area were already allocated to the other landings: Operation Avalanche at Salerno on the western coast, and Operation Baytown at Calabria. Instead, the division had to be transported across the Mediterranean by ships of the Royal Navy. The landing was unopposed, and the airborne division successfully captured the ports of Taranto, and later Brindisi on the Adriatic coast, in working order.

The only German forces in the area were elements of the German 1st Parachute Division, which engaged the advancing British in ambushes and at roadblocks during a fighting withdrawal north. By the end of September, the 1st Airborne Division had advanced to Foggia. Reinforcements from two infantry divisions, the 8th Indian and British 78th, had by then been landed behind them, which allowed the airborne troops to be withdrawn back to Taranto.

Despite casualties for the 1st Airborne Division in Italy being relatively light, the General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major General George Hopkinson, was killed while watching an assault by the 10th Parachute Battalion where he was mortally wounded by a burst of machine gun fire. He was replaced by Brigadier Ernest Down, previously the commander of 2nd Parachute Brigade.

===England===

By December 1943 the division had returned to England and begun training for operations in North-West Europe under the supervision of I Airborne Corps. Although the 1st Airborne Division was not scheduled to take part in the Normandy landings, a contingency plan, Operation Wasteage, was drawn up whereby the division would be parachuted in to support any of the five invasion beaches if serious delays were experienced. This plan turned out not to be required.

While the 6th Airborne Division were still fighting in Normandy, numerous plans to parachute the 1st Airborne Division into France were formulated, all to no avail. In June and July 1944, the plans included Operation Reinforcement, which was a landing to the west of St Sauveur-le-Vicomte to support the US 82nd Airborne Division, and Operation Wild Oats that would have seen the division land south of Caen to meet the advancing 7th Armoured Division moving from Villers-Bocage and the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and 4th Armoured Brigade advancing south out of the Orne bridgehead in a move to encircle and capture Caen. Such an airborne operation was vetoed by Trafford Leigh-Mallory, as being too risky for the aircraft involved. At any rate, the land portion of the attack (generally considered to be part of Operation Perch) bogged down due to German resistance and the delayed deployment of troops to Normandy.
There was also Operation Beneficiary, intended to support the American VIII Corps in capturing St Malo, and Operation Lucky Strike which had the objective of seizing bridges across the River Seine at Rouen. In Operation Sword Hilt, the division was to isolate the port of Brest and destroy the Morlaix viaduct. Operation Hands Up was intended to support the US Third Army by seizing the Vannes airfield.

By August the division was still waiting to be deployed, but now plans envisioned using them as part of a larger force. Operation Transfigure involved the division, the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, the US 101st Airborne Division, and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade landing at Rambouillet St Arnoult, to close the gap between Orléans and Paris. Operation Axehead, using the same force, was to seize the bridges over the River Seine in support of 21st Army Group. Operation Boxer, with the same force, was to seize Boulogne and assault V1 flying bomb sites.

Near the end of the month, Operation Linnet, with the same units as before, was formulated to seize crossings over the Escaut. Operation Infatuate, drawn up in early September, involved the entire I Airborne Corps landing in Belgium to trap the retreating German armies in the Scheldt estuary, as well as aiming to threaten Antwerp.

Finally, in September, there was Operation Comet, in which the division&#x27;s three brigades were to land in the Netherlands and each capture a river crossing. The first of these was the bridge over the River Waal at Nijmegen, the second the bridge over the River Maas at Grave, and the last was the bridge over the River Rhine at Arnhem. Planning for &quot;Comet&quot; was well advanced when on 10 September the mission was cancelled. Instead, a new operation was proposed with the same objectives as &quot;Comet&quot; but to be carried out by three divisions of the First Allied Airborne Army.

===Arnhem===
Operation Market Garden was an airborne assault by three divisions in the Netherlands in September 1944, including the British 1st and the American 82nd Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division, to secure key bridges and towns along the expected Allied axis of advance. Farthest north, 1st Airborne, supported by the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade, landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Nederrijn. Initially expecting an easy advance, XXX Corps, under Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks, to reach the airborne force at Arnhem within two to three days.

The 1st Airborne Division landed some distance from its objectives and was quickly hampered by unexpected resistance, especially from elements of the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer Divisions. Only a small force was able to reach the Arnhem road bridge, while the main body of the division was halted on the outskirts of the city. Meanwhile, XXX Corps was unable to advance north as quickly as anticipated and failed to relieve the airborne troops.

After four days, the small British force at the bridge was overwhelmed and the rest of the division became trapped in a pocket north of the river, where they could not be sufficiently reinforced by the Poles, or by XXX Corps when it arrived on the southern bank. After nine days of fighting, the shattered remains of the airborne forces were eventually withdrawn south of the Rhine. 1st Airborne lost 8,000 men during the battle and never saw combat again.

===Norway post-war===

In May 1945, immediately after the Allied Victory in Europe Day, the 1st Airborne Division was sent to disarm and repatriate the 350,000-strong German occupation army in Norway. The division maintained law and order until the arrival of the occupation force, Force 134. During its time in Norway, the division was tasked with supervising the surrender of the German forces in Norway, as well as preventing the sabotage of important military and civilian facilities.

The German Instrument of Surrender was delivered on 8 May to General Franz Böhme, the commander of all German forces stationed in Norway; the 1st Airborne Division landed near Oslo and Stavanger between 9 and 11 May. Most of the transport aircraft carrying the division landed safely, but one crash caused several fatalities. The division encountered little of the expected German resistance. Operational duties included welcoming back King Haakon, looking after Allied ex-prisoners of war, arresting war criminals and supervising the clearing of minefields. While in Norway, the division was also able to investigate what happened to the airborne troops that had taken part in Operation Freshman. The division returned to Britain, and was disbanded on 26 August 1945.

<doc id="382945" wikidata="Q1709343" url="?curid=382945" title="Soursop">
<text>Soursop (also called graviola, guyabano, and in Latin America guanábana) is the fruit of &quot;Annona muricata&quot;, a broadleaf, flowering, evergreen tree. It is native to the tropical regions of the Americas and the Caribbean and is widely propagated. It is in the same genus, &quot;Annona&quot;, as cherimoya and is in the Annonaceae family.

The soursop is adapted to areas of high humidity and relatively warm winters; temperatures below will cause damage to leaves and small branches, and temperatures below can be fatal. The fruit becomes dry and is no longer good for concentrate.

With an aroma similar to pineapple, the flavor of the fruit has been described as a combination of strawberries and apple with sour citrus flavor notes, contrasting with an underlying thick creamy texture reminiscent of banana.

Soursop is widely promoted (sometimes as graviola) as an alternative cancer treatment, but there is no reliable medical evidence that it is effective for treating cancer or any disease.

==&quot;Annona muricata&quot;==
&quot;Annona muricata&quot; is a species of the genus &quot;Annona&quot; of the custard apple tree family, Annonaceae, which has edible fruit. The fruit is usually called soursop due to its slightly acidic taste when ripe. &quot;Annona muricata&quot; is native to the Caribbean and Central America but is now widely cultivated – and in some areas, becoming invasive – in tropical and subtropical climates throughout the world, such as India.

The &quot;A. muricata&quot; fruit is generally called &quot;guanábana&quot; in Hispanic America, and the tree is a &quot;guanábano&quot;. 

&quot;Annona muricata&quot; is also the main host plant for tailed jay (&quot;Graphium agamemnon&quot;) caterpillars. They eat the leaves voraciously and usually stick under the leaves to pupate.

==Botanical description==
&quot;Annona muricata&quot; is a small, upright, evergreen tree that can grow to about tall.

Its young branches are hairy. Leaves are oblong to oval, to long and to wide. They are a glossy dark green with no hairs above, and paler and minutely hairy to no hairs below. The leaf stalks are to long and without hairs.

Flower stalks (peduncles) are to long and woody. They appear opposite from the leaves or as an extra from near the leaf stalk, each with one or two flowers, occasionally a third. Stalks for the individual flowers (pedicels) are stout and woody, minutely hairy to hairless and to with small bractlets nearer to the base which are densely hairy.

The petals are thick and yellowish. Outer petals meet at the edges without overlapping and are broadly ovate, to by to , tapering to a point with a heart shaped base. They are evenly thick, and are covered with long, slender, soft hairs externally and matted finely with soft hairs within. Inner petals are oval shaped and overlap. They measure roughly to by , and are sharply angled and tapering at the base. Margins are comparatively thin, with fine matted soft hairs on both sides. The receptacle is conical and hairy. The stamens are long and narrowly wedge-shaped. The connective-tip terminate abruptly and anther hollows are unequal. Sepals are quite thick and do not overlap. Carpels are linear and basally growing from one base. The ovaries are covered with dense reddish brown hairs, 1-ovuled, style short and stigma truncate. Its pollen is shed as permanent tetrads.

The fruits are oval, dark green when immature, with a leathery, inedible skin that turns yellow-green during maturity. They can be up to long, ( individuals up to fifteen inches (35 centimeters) have been reported) with a moderately firm texture, and may weigh . Their flesh is juicy, acidic, whitish, and aromatic somewhat like pineapple, although with a unique earthy aroma. Most of the immature segments are seedless, whereas mature fruit may contain as many as 200 seeds.

==Distribution==
&quot;Annona muricata&quot; is tolerant of poor soil and prefers lowland areas between the altitudes of 0 to . It cannot stand frost. The exact origin is unknown; it is native to the tropical regions of the Americas and is widely propagated. It is an introduced species on all temperate continents, especially in subtropical regions.

==Cultivation==
The plant is grown for its long, prickly, green fruit, which can have a mass of up to , making it probably the second biggest annona after the junglesop. Away from its native area, some limited production occurs as far north as southern Florida within USDA Zone 10; however, these are mostly garden plantings for local consumption. It is also grown in parts of China and Southeast Asia and is abundant on the Island of Mauritius. The main suppliers of the fruit are Mexico followed by Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Haiti. To aid soursop breeders and stimulate further development of genomic resources for this globally important plant family, the complete genome for &quot;Annona muricata&quot; was sequenced in 2021.

== Uses ==
=== Culinary ===
The flesh of the fruit consists of an edible, white pulp, some fiber, and a core of indigestible black seeds. The pulp is also used to make fruit nectar, smoothies, fruit juice drinks, as well as candies, sorbets, and ice cream flavorings. Due to the fruit&#x27;s widespread cultivation, its derivative products are consumed in many countries, such as Jamaica, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, and Fiji. The seeds are normally left in the preparation, and removed while consuming, unless a blender is used for processing.

Soursop is also a common ingredient for making fresh fruit juices that are sold by street food vendors. In Indonesia, the fruit is commonly called &quot;sirsak&quot; and sometimes made into &quot;dodol sirsak&quot;, a sweet which is made by boiling the soursop pulp in water and adding sugar until the mixture caramelizes and hardens. In the Philippines, it is called &quot;guyabano&quot;, derived from the Spanish &quot;guanábana&quot;, and is eaten ripe, or used to make juices, smoothies, or ice cream. Sometimes, the leaf is used in tenderizing meat. In Vietnam, this fruit is called &quot;mãng cầu Xiêm&quot; (Siamese soursop) in the south, or &quot;mãng cầu&quot; (soursop) in the north, and is used to make smoothies, or eaten as is. In Cambodia, this fruit is called &quot;tearb barung&quot;, literally &quot;western custard-apple fruit&quot;. In Malaysia, it is known in Malay as &quot;durian belanda&quot; (&quot;Dutch durian&quot;) and in East Malaysia, specifically among the Dusun people of Sabah, it is locally known as &quot;lampun&quot;. Popularly, it is eaten raw when it ripens, or used as one of the ingredients in &quot;ais kacang&quot; or &quot;ais batu campur&quot;. Usually the fruits are taken from the tree when they mature and left to ripen in a dark corner, whereafter they will be eaten when they are fully ripe. It has a white flower with a very pleasing scent, especially in the morning. While for people in Brunei Darussalam this fruit is popularly known as &quot;durian salat&quot;, widely available and easily planted.

Soursop leaves are sold and consumed in Indonesia as herbal medicine. The leaves are usually boiled to make tea.

==Subspecies as synonyms==
* &quot;Annona muricata&quot; var. &quot;borinquensis&quot;

== Nutrition ==

Raw soursop is 81% water, 17% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat (see table). In a reference amount of , the raw fruit supplies of food energy, and contains only vitamin C as a significant amount (23%) of the Daily Value, with no other micronutrients in appreciable amounts (table).

==Phytochemicals==
The compound annonacin is contained in the fruit, seeds, and leaves of soursop. The leaves of &quot;Annona muricata&quot; contain annonamine, which is an aporphine-class alkaloid containing a quaternary ammonium group. The plant also contains lichexanthone, a compound in the xanthone class.

===Potential neurotoxicity===
The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center cautions, &quot;alkaloids extracted from graviola may cause neuronal dysfunction&quot;. Annonacin has been shown in laboratory research to be neurotoxic. In 2010, the French food safety agency, Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé, concluded that &quot;it is not possible to confirm that the observed cases of atypical Parkinson syndrome ... are linked to the consumption of &quot;Annona muricata&quot;&quot;.

===False cancer treatment claims===
In 2008, the Federal Trade Commission in the United States stated that use of soursop to treat cancer was &quot;bogus&quot;, and there was &quot;no credible scientific evidence&quot; that the extract of soursop sold by Bioque Technologies &quot;can prevent, cure, or treat cancer of any kind.&quot; Also in 2008, a UK court case relating to the sale of Triamazon, a soursop product, resulted in the criminal conviction of a man under the terms of the UK Cancer Act for offering to treat people for cancer. A spokesman for the council that instigated the action stated, &quot;it is as important now as it ever was that people are protected from those peddling unproven products with spurious claims as to their effects.&quot;

The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Cancer Research UK state that cancer treatment using soursop is not supported by reliable clinical evidence. According to Cancer Research UK, &quot;Many sites on the internet advertise and promote graviola capsules as a cancer cure, but none of them are supported by any reputable scientific cancer organizations&quot; and &quot;there is no evidence to show that graviola works as a cure for cancer&quot;.

<doc id="382950" wikidata="Q504652" url="?curid=382950" title="Richard Wurmbrand">
<text>Richard Wurmbrand, also known as Nicolai Ionescu (24 March 1909 – 17 February 2001) was a Romanian Evangelical Lutheran priest, and professor of Jewish descent. In 1948, having become a Christian ten years before, he publicly said Communism and Christianity were incompatible. Wurmbrand preached at bomb shelters and rescued Jews during World War II. He experienced imprisonment and torture by the Communist regime of Romania, which maintained a policy of state atheism.

After serving a total of fourteen years, he was ransomed for $10,000. His colleagues in Romania urged him to leave the country and work for religious freedom from a location less personally dangerous. After spending time in Norway and England, he and his wife Sabina, who had also been imprisoned, emigrated to America and dedicated the rest of their lives to publicizing and helping Christians who are persecuted for their beliefs.

He wrote more than 18 books, the most widely known being &quot;Tortured for Christ&quot; and &quot;Answer to Moscow&#x27;s (Atheist) Bible&quot;. Variations of his works have been translated into more than 65 languages.

==Early life==
Wurmbrand, the youngest of four boys, was born in 1909 in Bucharest in a Jewish family. He lived with his family in Istanbul for a short while, his father died when he was 9, and the Wurmbrands returned to Romania when he was 15.

As an adolescent, he was sent to study Marxism in Moscow, but returned clandestinely the following year. Pursued by Siguranţa Statului (the secret police), he was arrested and held in Doftana Prison. When returning to his mother country, Wurmbrand was already an important Comintern agent, leader, and coordinator directly paid from Moscow. Like other Romanian Communists, he was arrested several times, then sentenced and released again.

He married Sabina Oster on 26 October 1936. Their son Michael was born in 1941. Wurmbrand and his wife (known as Bintzea to her friends) converted to Christianity in 1938 due to the witness of Christian Wolfkes, a Romanian Christian carpenter; they joined the Anglican Church&#x27;s Ministry among Jewish people (CMJ UK). Wurmbrand was ordained twice—first as an Anglican, then, after World War II, as a Lutheran priest. In 1944, when the Soviet Union occupied Romania as the first step to establishing a communist regime, Wurmbrand began a ministry to his Romanian countrymen and to Red Army soldiers; the Socialist Republic of Romania had a doctrine of state atheism. When the government attempted to control churches, he immediately began an &quot;underground&quot; ministry to his people. Wurmbrand was a professor in the only Lutheran seminary in his country. Though a devout Lutheran priest, Wurmbrand was highly ecumenical in that he worked with Christians of many denominations. Wurmbrand is remembered for his courage in standing up in a gathering of church leaders and denouncing government control of the churches. He was arrested on 29 February 1948, while on his way to a Divine Service.

==Imprisonments==

Wurmbrand, who passed through the penal facilities of Pitești, Craiova, Gherla, the Danube–Black Sea Canal, Văcărești, Malmaison, Cluj and ultimately Jilava, where he spent three years in solitary confinement. This confinement was in a cell twelve feet underground, with no lights or windows. There was no sound because even the guards wore felt on the soles of their shoes. He later recounted that he maintained his sanity by sleeping during the day, staying awake at night, and exercising his mind and soul by composing and then delivering a sermon each night. Due to his extraordinary memory, he was able to recall more than 350 of those, a selection of which he included in his book &quot;With God in Solitary Confinement&quot;, which was first published in 1969. During part of this time, he later wrote about communicating with other inmates by tapping out Morse code on the wall. In this way he continued to &quot;be sunlight&quot; to fellow inmates rather than dwell on the lack of physical light.

Wurmbrand was released from his first imprisonment in 1956, after eight and a half years. Although he was warned not to preach, he resumed his work in the underground church. He was arrested again in 1959 and sentenced to 25 years. During his imprisonment, he was beaten and tortured. He stated that his physical torture included mutilation, burning and being locked in a large frozen icebox. His body bore the scars of physical torture for the rest of his life. For example, he later recounted having the soles of his feet beaten until the flesh was torn off, then the next day beaten again to the bone, claiming there were not words to describe that pain.

During his first imprisonment, Wurmbrand&#x27;s supporters were unable to gain information about him; later they found out that a false name had been used in the prison records so that no one could trace his whereabouts. Members of the Secret police visited Sabina posing as released fellow prisoners. They claimed to have attended her husband&#x27;s funeral. During his second imprisonment, his wife Sabina was given official news of his death, which she did not believe. Sabina herself had been arrested in 1950 and spent three years in penal labour on the canal. Sabina&#x27;s autobiographical account of this time is titled &quot;The Pastor&#x27;s Wife&quot;. Their only son, Mihai, by then a young adult, was expelled from college-level studies at three institutions because his father was a political prisoner; an attempt to obtain permission to emigrate to Norway to avoid compulsory service in the Romanian army was unsuccessful.

Eventually, Wurmbrand was a recipient of an amnesty in 1964. Concerned with the possibility that Wurmbrand would be forced to undergo further imprisonment, the Norwegian Mission to the Jews and the Hebrew Christian Alliance negotiated with Communist authorities for his release from Romania for $10,000 (though the going rate for political prisoners was $1,900). He was convinced by underground church leaders to leave and become a voice for the persecuted church. He devoted the rest of his life to this effort, despite warnings and death threats.

He was a friend of Costache Ioanid, the Romanian Christian poet.

==Achievements, influence, and death==
Wurmbrand travelled to Norway, England, and then the United States. In May 1966, he testified in Washington, D.C., before the U.S. Senate&#x27;s Internal Security Subcommittee. That testimony, in which he took off his shirt in front of TV cameras to show the scars of his torture, brought him to public attention. He became known as &quot;The Voice of the Underground Church&quot;, doing much to publicise the persecution of Christians in Communist countries. He compiled circumstantial evidence that Karl Marx was a Satanist.

In April 1967, the Wurmbrands formed Jesus to the Communist world, later renamed Voice of the Martyrs, an interdenominational organisation working initially with and for persecuted Christians in Communist countries, but later expanding its activities to help persecuted believers in other places, especially in the Muslim world.

In 1990, he and his wife returned to Romania for the first time in 25 years. The Voice of the Martyrs opened a printing facility and bookstore in Bucharest. The new mayor of Bucharest had offered a storage space for the books under former dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s palace, where he had spent years in confinement, praying for a ministry to his homeland. Wurmbrand engaged in preaching with local ministers of nearly all denominations.

Wurmbrand wrote 18 books in English and others in Romanian. His best-known book, titled &quot;Tortured for Christ&quot;, was published in 1967. In several of them, he wrote very boldly and emphatically against Communism, yet he maintained a hope and compassion even for those who tortured him by &quot;looking at men ... not as they are, but as they will be ... I could also see in our persecutors. a future Apostle Paul ... [and] the jailer in Philippi who became a convert.&quot; Wurmbrand last lived in Palos Verdes, California. 

He died at the age of 91 on 17 February 2001 in a hospital in Torrance, California. His wife, Sabina, had died six months earlier on 11 August 2000. In 2006, he was voted fifth among the greatest Romanians according to the &quot;Mari Români&quot; poll.

<text>Sir Frederick Arthur Montague Browning (20 December 1896 – 14 March 1965) was a senior officer of the British Army who has been called the &quot;father of the British airborne forces&quot;. He was also an Olympic bobsleigh competitor, and the husband of author Daphne du Maurier.

Educated at Eton College and then at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Browning was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Grenadier Guards in 1915. During the First World War, he fought on the Western Front, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for conspicuous gallantry during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917. In September 1918, he became aide de camp to General Sir Henry Rawlinson.

During the Second World War, Browning commanded the 1st Airborne Division and I Airborne Corps, and was also the deputy commander of First Allied Airborne Army during Operation Market Garden in September 1944. During the planning for this operation, it has been suggested that he said: &quot;I think we might be going .&quot; In December 1944 he became chief of staff of Admiral Lord Mountbatten&#x27;s South East Asia Command. From September 1946 to January 1948, he was Military Secretary of the War Office.

In January 1948, Browning became comptroller and treasurer to Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh. After she ascended to the throne as Queen Elizabeth II in 1952, he became treasurer in the Office of the Duke of Edinburgh. He suffered a severe nervous breakdown in 1957 and retired in 1959. He died at Menabilly, the mansion that inspired his wife&#x27;s novel &quot;Rebecca&quot;, on 14 March 1965.

==Early life==
Frederick Arthur Montague Browning was born on 20 December 1896 at his family home at 31 Hans Road, Brompton, London. The house was later demolished to make way for an expansion of Harrods, allowing him to claim in later life that he had been born in its piano department. He was the first son of Frederick Henry Browning, a wine merchant, and his wife Anne &quot;Nancy&quot; née Alt. He had one sibling, an older sister, Helen Grace. From an early age, he was known to his family as &quot;Tommy&quot;. He was educated at West Downs School and Eton College, which his grandfather had attended. While at Eton, he joined the Officer Training Corps.

==First World War==
Browning sat the entrance examinations for the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, on 24 November 1914. Although he did not achieve the necessary scores in all the required subjects, the headmasters of some schools, including Eton, were in a position to recommend students for nomination by the Army Council. The headmaster of Eton, Edward Lyttelton, put Browning&#x27;s name forward and in this way he entered Sandhurst on 27 December 1914. He graduated on 16 June 1915, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards. Joining such an exclusive regiment, even in wartime, required a personal introduction and an interview by the regimental commander, Colonel Sir Henry Streatfeild.

Initially, Browning, promoted to lieutenant on 15 July, joined the 4th Battalion, Grenadier Guards, which was training at Bovington Camp. When the 4th Battalion departed for the Western Front in August 1915, he was transferred to the 5th (Reserve) Battalion. In October 1915 he left it to join the 2nd Battalion at the front. The battalion formed part of the 1st Guards Brigade of the Guards Division. Around this time he acquired the nickname &quot;Boy&quot;. For a time he served in the same company of 2nd Battalion as Major Winston Churchill. Upon Churchill&#x27;s arrival, Browning was given the job of showing him the company&#x27;s trenches. When Browning discovered that Churchill had no greatcoat, Browning gave Churchill his own.

Browning was invalided back to England with trench fever in January 1916, and, although only hospitalised for four weeks, was not passed as fit for service at the front until 20 September, and did not rejoin the 2nd Battalion at the front until 6 October 1916. After being discharged from hospital, he went on leave for two months. In April he was posted to the 5th (Reserve) Battalion, and then to the Guards Depot at Caterham Barracks.
Browning fought in the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 31 July 1917, the Battle of Poelcappelle on 9 October and the Battle of Cambrai in November. He distinguished himself at Cambrai and was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), usually given only to officers in command, above the rank of lieutenant-colonel. When a junior officer like Browning, who was still only a lieutenant, was awarded the DSO, this was often regarded as an acknowledgement that the officer had only just missed out on being awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). His citation read:

He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre on 14 December 1917, the same month he was made an acting captain, a rank he held until December 1920, and was mentioned in despatches on 23 May 1918. In September 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive which saw the tide of the war turn in favour of the Allies, Browning temporarily became aide de camp to General Sir Henry Rawlinson, commander of the British Fourth Army. The appointment only lasted a few weeks, however, before Browning returned to his regiment in early November. He was promoted to the temporary rank of captain, and appointed adjutant of the 1st Grenadier Guards, then part of the 3rd Guards Brigade of the Guards Division, in November 1918.

==Inter-war period==

Browning was granted the substantive (permanent) rank of captain on 24 November 1920. He retained his post as adjutant until November 1921, when he was posted to the Guards&#x27; Depot at Caterham Barracks. In 1924 he was posted to Sandhurst as adjutant. He was the first adjutant, during the Sovereign&#x27;s Parade of 1926, to ride his horse (named &quot;The Vicar&quot;) up the steps of Old College and to dismount in the Grand Entrance. There is no satisfactory explanation as to why he did it. After the Second World War this became an enduring tradition, but since horses have great difficulty going down steps, a ramp is now provided for the horse to return.

Other members of staff at Sandhurst at the time included Richard O&#x27;Connor, Miles Dempsey, Douglas Gracey, Ronald Brittain and Eric Dorman-Smith. Dorman-Smith and Browning became close friends. Browning relinquished the appointment of adjutant at Sandhurst on 28 April 1928, and was promoted to major on 22 May 1928. Following a pattern whereby tours of duty away from the regiment alternated with those in it, he was sent for a refresher course at the Small Arms School before being posted to the 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards, at Pirbright.

His workload was very light, allowing plenty of time for sport. Browning competed in the Amateur Athletic Association of England championships in hurdling, finishing third behind L. H. Phillips in the 440 yards hurdles event at the 1923 AAA Championships but failed to make Olympic selection. He did however make the Olympic five-man bobsleigh team as brake-man. An injury incurred during a training accident prevented his participation in the bobsleigh at the 1924 Winter Olympics, but he competed in the bobsleigh at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland, in which his team finished tenth. Browning was also a keen sailor, competing in the Household Cavalry Sailing Regatta at Chichester Harbour in 1930. He purchased his own motor boat, a cabin cruiser that he named &quot;Ygdrasil&quot;.

In 1931, Browning read Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s novel &quot;The Loving Spirit&quot; and, impressed by its graphic depictions of the Cornish coastline, set out to see it for himself on &quot;Ygdrasil&quot;. Afterwards, he left the boat moored in the River Fowey for the winter, and returned in April 1932 to collect it. He heard that the author of the book that had impressed him so much was convalescing from an appendix operation, and invited her out on his boat. After a short romance, he proposed to her but she rejected this, as she did not believe in marriage. Dorman-Smith visited her and explained that it would be disastrous for Browning&#x27;s career for him to live with Du Maurier without marriage. Du Maurier then proposed to Browning, who accepted. They were married in a simple ceremony at the Church of St Willow, Lanteglos-by-Fowey on 19 July 1932, and honeymooned on &quot;Ygdrasil&quot;. Their marriage produced three children: two daughters, Tessa (later second wife of David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, son and heir of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery) and Flavia (later wife of General Sir Peter Leng), and a son, Christian, known as Kits.

Browning was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 1 February 1936, and was appointed commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion, Grenadier Guards. The battalion was deployed to Egypt in 1936 and returned in December 1937. His term as commander ended on 1 August 1939; he was removed from the Grenadier Guards&#x27; regimental list but remained on full pay. On 1 September, he was promoted to colonel, with his seniority backdated to 1 February 1939, and became assistant commandant of the Small Arms School.

==Second World War==
===Airborne troops===
====Establishment====
Browning remained in this position for a month before becoming the school&#x27;s commandant, which saw him promoted to the acting rank of brigadier. Despite this being an important job he was not altogether pleased with the assignment: his wish was to be with one of the three regular Grenadier battalions out in France.
In mid-May 1940, Browning, his rank of brigadier having by now been made temporary rather than acting, was given command of the 128th (Hampshire) Infantry Brigade, consisting of the 1/4th, 2/4th and 5th Battalions of the Hampshire Regiment. Part of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, which was then commanded by Major-General Robert Pollok, the brigade was a Territorial Army unit that was preparing to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. This was pre-empted by the Dunkirk evacuation and the subsequent fall of France in June, and the division instead assumed a defensive posture.

The next few months were spent in numerous activities, the most important of which was training to repel a possible German invasion of Britain. The severe shortage of equipment that plagued the army during this time made Browning&#x27;s already formidable task even more difficult. Despite this, he managed to impress his superiors, including his immediate superior, Pollok, who was inspired by the way in which Browning&#x27;s brigade responded to his command. He recommended Browning for the command of a division, as did Lieutenant-General Francis Nosworthy, commanding IV Corps (the 43rd Division&#x27;s parent formation), and Lieutenant-General Guy Williams, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Eastern Command, although all three believed that Browning needed more time and experience.

In late February 1941, after handing over the brigade to Brigadier Manley James, Browning succeeded Brigadier The Hon. William Fraser, a fellow Grenadier Guardsman and an old friend, in command of the 24th Guards Brigade Group. Such was his popularity by now within the 128th Brigade, that when Browning left his old command many members of the brigade turned out to cheer him on and wish him well. While the 24th Brigade was not a division, it was perhaps the next best thing to one. The brigade group&#x27;s objective was to defend London from an attack from the south.

On 3 November 1941, Browning was promoted to the acting rank of major-general, and appointed as the first General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the newly created 1st Airborne Division. The division initially comprised the 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Richard Gale, and the 1st Airlanding Brigade, under Brigadier George Hopkinson. In this new role he was instrumental in parachutists adopting the maroon beret, and assigned an artist, Major Edward Seago, to design the Parachute Regiment&#x27;s emblem of the mythical Greek hero Bellerophon riding the winged horse Pegasus. Because of this he has been called the &quot;father of the British airborne forces&quot;. Browning designed his own uniform. He qualified as a pilot in 1942, and henceforth wore the Army Air Corps wings, which he also designed.

====Training====
Browning supervised the newly formed division as it underwent a prolonged period of expansion and intensive training, with new brigades raised and assigned to the division, and new equipment tested. Though not considered an airborne warfare visionary, he proved adept at dealing with the War Office and Air Ministry, and demonstrated a knack for overcoming bureaucratic obstacles. As the airborne forces expanded in size, the major difficulty in getting the 1st Airborne Division ready for operations was a shortage of aircraft. The Royal Air Force (RAF) had neglected air transport before the war, and the only available aircraft for airborne troops were conversions of obsolete bombers like the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley.

When Churchill, who was now the Prime Minister, and General George C. Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, visited the 1st Airborne Division on 16 April 1942, they were treated to a demonstration involving every available aircraft of No. 38 Wing RAF—12 Whitleys and nine Hawker Hector target-tug biplanes towing General Aircraft Hotspur gliders. At a meeting on 6 May chaired by Churchill, Browning was asked what he required. He stated that he needed 96 aircraft to get the 1st Airborne Division battle-ready. Churchill directed Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal to find the required aircraft, and Portal &quot;grudgingly&quot; agreed to supply 83 Whitleys, along with 10 Halifax bombers to tow the new, larger General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders. Air Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, Commander-in-Chief RAF Bomber Command, in particular, felt that the 1st Airborne Division was not worth the drain on Bomber Command&#x27;s resources.

In July 1942, Browning travelled to the United States, where he toured airborne training facilities with his American counterpart, Major-General William C. Lee, who soon took command of the US 101st Airborne Division. Browning&#x27;s tendency to lecture the Americans on airborne warfare made him few friends among the Americans, who felt that the British were still novices themselves. Browning was envious of the Americans&#x27; equipment, particularly the Douglas C-47 (known in British service as &quot;Dakota&quot;) transport aircraft. On returning to the United Kingdom in early August, he arranged for a joint exercise to be conducted with the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment (2/503) and the 1st Airlanding Brigade, with the 1st Parachute Brigade and the 2nd (Armoured) Battalion of the Irish Guards.

====Operation Torch====
In mid–September, as the 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength, Browning was informed that Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, would take place in November. When he found that the 2/503 was to take part, Browning argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised, as the vast distances and comparatively light opposition would provide opportunities for airborne operations. The War Office and the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, General Sir Bernard Paget, were won over by Browning&#x27;s arguments, and agreed to detach the 1st Parachute Brigade, now under Brigadier Edwin Flavell, from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of US Lieutenant-General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion. After it had been brought to full operational strength, partly by cross-posting personnel from the newly formed 2nd Parachute Brigade, and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources, the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November.

The results of British airborne operations in North Africa were mixed, and the subject of a detailed report by Browning. The airborne troops had operated under several handicaps, including shortages of aerial photographs and maps of the target area. All the troop carrier aircrew were American, and lacked familiarity with airborne operations and in dealing with British troops and equipment. Browning felt that the inexperience with handling airborne operations extended to Eisenhower&#x27;s Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) and that of the British First Army, resulting in the paratroops being misused. He felt that had they been employed more aggressively and in greater strength they might have shortened the Tunisian campaign by some months. The 1st Parachute Brigade was called the &quot;Rote Teufel&quot; (&quot;Red Devils&quot;) by the German troops they had fought. Browning pointed out to the brigade that this was an honour, as &quot;distinctions given by the enemy are seldom won in battle except by the finest fighting troops.&quot; The title was officially confirmed by General Sir Harold Alexander, commander of the Allied 18th Army Group, formed from British Eighth Army (advancing from the east into Tunisia) and First Army. Henceforth, it applied to all British airborne troops.

====Allied Force Headquarters posting====
On 1 January 1943, Browning was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He relinquished command of the 1st Airborne Division to Hopkinson in March 1943 to take up a new post as Major-General, Airborne Forces at Eisenhower&#x27;s AFHQ. He soon clashed with the commander of the American 82nd Airborne Division, Major-General Matthew Ridgway. When Browning asked to see the plans for Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily, Ridgway replied that they would not be available for scrutiny until after they had been approved by the US Seventh Army commander, Lieutenant-General George S. Patton. When Browning protested, Patton backed Ridgway, but Eisenhower and his chief of staff, Major-General Walter Bedell Smith, supported Browning and forced them to back down.

Browning&#x27;s dealings with the British Army were no smoother. Hopkinson sold the British Eighth Army commander, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, on Operation Ladbroke, a glider landing to seize the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse. Browning&#x27;s objections to the operation were ignored, and attempts to discuss airborne operations with the corps commanders elicited a directive from Montgomery that all such discussion had to go through him. The operation was a disaster, as Browning had predicted. Inexperienced aircrew released the gliders too early, and many crashed into the sea; 252 soldiers were drowned. Those that made it to land were scattered over a wide area. The troops captured their objective, but were driven off by an Italian counterattack. Browning concluded that to be effective, the airborne advisor had to have equal rank with the army commanders.

In September 1943, Browning travelled to India, where he inspected the 50th Parachute Brigade, and met with Major-General Orde Wingate, the commander of the Chindits. Browning held a series of meetings with General Sir Claude Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief, India; Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse, the Air Officer Commander-in-Chief; and Lieutenant-General Sir George Giffard, the GOC Eastern Army. They discussed plans for improving the airborne establishment in India and expanding the airborne force there to a division. As a result of these discussions, and Browning&#x27;s subsequent report to the War Office, the 44th Indian Airborne Division was formed in October 1944. Browning sent his most experienced airborne commander, Major-General Ernest Down, to India as GOC of the 44th Division. Formerly the commander of the 2nd Parachute Brigade, Down had succeeded Hopkinson as GOC 1st Airborne Division after Hopkinson had been killed in Italy. Down&#x27;s replacement as GOC 1st Airborne Division was Montgomery&#x27;s selection, Major-General Roy Urquhart, an officer with no airborne experience, rather than Browning&#x27;s choice, Brigadier Gerald Lathbury of the 1st Parachute Brigade. The decision was to become controversial.

US Brigadier-General James M. Gavin, recalled that when he travelled to England in November 1943 to assume command of the 82nd Airborne Division, Ridgway &quot;cautioned me against the machinations and scheming of General F. M. Browning, who was the senior British airborne officer, and well he should have.&quot; Gavin was taken aback by Browning&#x27;s criticism of Ridgway on the grounds that he had not parachuted into Sicily with his troops. US Major-General Ray Barker, who worked in Eisenhower&#x27;s Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), warned him that Browning was &quot;an empire builder&quot;, an assessment with which Gavin came to agree.

===Operation Market Garden===

Browning assumed a new command on 4 December 1943. His Directive No. 1 announced that &quot;the title of the force is Headquarters, Airborne Troops (21st Army Group). All correspondence will bear the official title, but verbally it will be known as the Airborne Corps and I will be referred to as the Corps Commander.&quot; He was promoted to lieutenant-general on 7 January 1944, with his seniority backdated to 9 December 1943. He officially became commander of I Airborne Corps on 16 April 1944.

I Airborne Corps became part of the First Allied Airborne Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Lewis H. Brereton, in August 1944. While retaining command of the corps, Browning also became Deputy Commander of the First Allied Airborne Army, despite a poor relationship with Brereton and being disliked by many American officers. During preparations for one of many cancelled operations, Linnete II, his disagreement with Brereton over a risky operation caused him to threaten resignation, which, due to differences in military culture, Brereton regarded as tantamount to disobeying an order. Browning was forced to back down.

When I Airborne Corps was committed to action in Operation Market Garden in September 1944, Browning&#x27;s rift with Brereton had severe repercussions. Browning was concerned about the timetable put forward by Major-General Paul L. Williams of the IX Troop Carrier Command, under which the drop was staggered over several days, with only one drop on the first day. This restricted the number of combat troops that would be available on the first day. He also disagreed with the British drop zones proposed by Air Vice Marshal Leslie Hollinghurst of No. 38 Group, which he felt were too distant from the bridge at Arnhem, but Browning felt unable to challenge the airmen.

Browning downplayed Ultra evidence brought to him by his intelligence officer, Major Brian Urquhart, that the 9th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hohenstaufen&quot; and the 10th SS Panzer Division &quot;Frundsberg&quot; were in the Arnhem area, but was not as confident as he led his subordinates to believe. When informed that his airborne troops would have to hold the bridge for two days, Browning is said to have responded that they could hold it for four, but later claimed that he had added: &quot;But I think we might be going a bridge too far.&quot;
Browning landed by gliders with a tactical headquarters near Nijmegen with Gavin&#x27;s 82nd Airborne Division on 17 September 1944, the first day of the operation. His use of 38 aircraft to move his corps headquarters on the first lift has been criticised. Half of these gliders carried signal equipment but for much of the operation he had no contact with either the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem or Major-General Maxwell D. Taylor&#x27;s US 101st Airborne Division at Eindhoven. His headquarters had not been envisaged as a frontline unit, and the signals section that had been hastily assembled just weeks before lacked training and experience. In his pack, Browning carried three teddy bears and a framed print of Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s &quot;The Praying Hands&quot;.

After the war, Gavin was criticised for the decision to secure the high ground around Groesbeek before attempting the capture of the road and the Nijmegen railway bridge. Browning took responsibility for this, noting that he &quot;personally gave an order to Jim Gavin that, although every effort should be made to effect the capture of the Grave and Nijmegen bridges as soon as possible, it was essential that he should capture the Groesbeek Ridge and hold it&quot;. Gavin&#x27;s opinion of Browning was uncomplimentary: &quot;There is no doubt that in our system he would have been summarily relieved and sent home in disgrace.&quot;

Browning was awarded the Order of &quot;Polonia Restituta&quot; (II class) by the Polish government-in-exile, but his critical evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major-General Stanisław Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade. Some writers later claimed that Sosabowski had been made a scapegoat for the failure of Market Garden. Montgomery attached no blame to Browning or any of his subordinates, or indeed acknowledged failure at all. He told Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, that he would like Browning to take over VIII Corps in the event that Sir Richard O&#x27;Connor, the GOC, was transferred to another theatre.

===South East Asia Command===
Events took a different course. Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command (SEAC), had need of a new chief of staff owing to the poor health of Lieutenant-General Henry Pownall. Brooke turned down Mountbatten&#x27;s initial request for either Lieutenant-General Sir Archibald Nye or Lieutenant-General Sir John Swayne. He then offered Browning for the post, and Mountbatten accepted. Pownall considered that Browning was &quot;excellently qualified&quot; for the post, although Browning had no staff college training and had never held a staff job before. Pownall noted that his &quot;only reservation is that I believe [Browning] is rather nervy and highly strung&quot;. For his services as a corps commander, Browning was mentioned in despatches a second time, and was awarded the Legion of Merit in the degree of Commander by the United States government.

Browning served in South East Asia from December 1944 until July 1946; Mountbatten soon came to regard him as indispensable. Browning had an American deputy, Major-General Horace H. Fuller, and brought staff with him from Europe to SEAC headquarters in Kandy, Ceylon. For his services at SEAC, Browning was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 1 January 1946. His last major military post was as Military Secretary of the War Office from 16 September 1946 to January 1948, although he did not formally retire from the Army until 5 April 1948.
==Later life==
In January 1948, Browning became Comptroller and Treasurer to Her Royal Highness the Princess Elizabeth. This appointment was made on the recommendation of Lord Mountbatten, whose nephew Philip Mountbatten was the Duke of Edinburgh. As such, Browning became the head of the Princess&#x27; personal staff. Browning also juggled other duties. In 1948 he was involved with the 1948 Summer Olympics as Deputy Chairman of the British Olympic Association, and commandant of the British team. From 1944 to 1962 he was Commodore of the Royal Fowey Yacht Club; on stepping down in 1962, he was elected its first admiral.

Upon the death of King George VI in 1952, the Princess Elizabeth came to the throne as Queen Elizabeth II, and Browning and his staff became redundant, as the Queen was served by the large staff of the monarch. The domestic staff remained at Clarence House, where they continued to serve the Queen Mother; the remainder were reorganised as the Office of the Duke of Edinburgh, with Browning as treasurer, the head of the office, and moved into a new and larger office at Buckingham Palace. Like the Duke they served, the office had no constitutional role, but supported his sporting, cultural and scientific interests. Browning became involved with the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; Trust, set up to preserve the famous ship, and the administration of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award. In June 1953, Browning and du Maurier attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

Browning had been drinking since the war, but it now became chronic. This led to a severe nervous breakdown in July 1957, forcing his resignation from his position at the Palace in 1959. Du Maurier had known he had a mistress in Fowey, but his breakdown brought to light two other girlfriends in London. For her part, du Maurier confessed to her own wartime affair. For his services to the Royal Household, Browning was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1953, and was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the order in 1959. He retreated to Menabilly, the mansion that had inspired du Maurier&#x27;s novel &quot;Rebecca&quot;, which she had leased and restored in 1943. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Cornwall in March 1960. Browning caused a scandal in 1963 when, under the influence of prescription drugs and alcohol, he was involved in a car crash in which two people were injured. He was fined £50 () and had to pay court and medical costs. He died from a heart attack at Menabilly on 14 March 1965.

==Legacy==
Browning was portrayed by Dirk Bogarde in the film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, which was based on the events of Operation Market Garden. A copy of Browning&#x27;s uniform was made to Bogarde&#x27;s measurements from the original in the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum. Du Maurier responded angrily to early reports of how Browning was portrayed, and wrote to Mountbatten, urging him to boycott the premiere. He did not do so, explaining that proceeds were going to a charity that he supported. After seeing the film he wrote back that he could find nothing detrimental to Browning in it, and did not think that Browning&#x27;s reputation had been tarnished. He pointed out that Operation Market Garden was a disaster, and blame had to be shared by those in charge, which included Browning. The Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum, which opened in 1969, was for many years located in Browning Barracks at Aldershot, which had been built in 1964 and named after him. It remained the depot of the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces until 1993. The museum moved to the Imperial War Museum Duxford in 2008, and Browning Barracks was sold for housing development.

<text>Helen Gahagan Douglas (born Helen Mary Gahagan; November 25, 1900 – June 28, 1980) was an American actress and politician.

Gahagan Douglas&#x27;s acting career included success on Broadway, as a touring opera singer, and in Hollywood films. Her portrayal of the villain in &quot;She&quot; (1935) inspired the Evil Queen in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937).

In 1944, Gahagan Douglas was first elected to the United States Congress. In the 1950 U.S. Senate election in California, she lost to Republican nominee Richard M. Nixon. The campaign became symbolic of modern political vitriol, as both Gahagan Douglas&#x27;s Democratic primary opponent Manchester Boddy and Nixon referred to her as &quot;pink right down to her underwear&quot;, suggesting Communist sympathies.

==Early life==
Helen Mary Gahagan was born in Boonton, New Jersey, of Scotch-Irish descent. She was the eldest daughter of Lillian Rose (Mussen) and Walter H. Gahagan, an engineer who owned a construction business in Brooklyn and a shipyard in Arverne, Queens; her mother had been a schoolteacher. She was reared Episcopalian. Gahagan was raised at 231 Lincoln Place in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn, an upper-middle-class neighborhood. She attended the prestigious Berkeley Carroll School, where she &quot;attracted the favorable attention of Brooklyn critics through her performance in school plays&quot;. Following an argument with her father, who did not believe becoming an actress was a suitable occupation for a woman, she was sent to study at the Capen School for Girls in Northampton, Massachusetts.

Gahagan gained admittance to Barnard College of Columbia University, class of 1924. To the dismay and shock of her father she left after two years, without finishing her degree, to pursue an acting career.

==Acting career==

Gahagan found great success and became a well known star on Broadway in the 1920s, appearing in popular plays such as &quot;Young Woodley&quot; and &quot;Trelawney of the Wells&quot;.

In 1927, at the age of 26, Gahagan set out to forge a new career as an opera singer, and, after two years of voice lessons, she found herself touring across Europe and receiving critical praise, unusual for an American at the time. In 1930, she returned to Broadway to star in a production of &quot;Tonight or Never&quot;, where she co-starred with actor Melvyn Douglas. The two married in 1931, Gahagan keeping her maiden name. They had two children, Peter and Mary.

Gahagan Douglas went to Los Angeles in 1935, starring in the Hollywood movie &quot;She&quot;, playing Hash-a-Motep, queen of a lost city. The movie, based on H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s novel of the same name, is perhaps best known for popularizing a phrase from the novel, &quot;She who must be obeyed&quot;. Gahagan&#x27;s depiction of the &quot;ageless ice goddess&quot; served as inspiration for the Evil Queen in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;.

While in Vienna in 1938, performing in opera (which was a dream come true for Gahagan Douglas), she found herself having coffee with a Nazi sympathizer. The experience sickened her to such a degree that she immediately flew back to Los Angeles, determined to fight Nazism publicly.

==Political career==
Introduced to politics by her husband, Gahagan Douglas joined the Democratic Party shortly after the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. The Roosevelts and the Douglases would develop a close friendship, with Eleanor Roosevelt serving as a political mentor to Gahagan Douglas.

She largely disliked the atmosphere of Hollywood; following the birth of her daughter, Mary Helen, in 1938, Gahagan Douglas took to learning about the plight of migrant workers and grew increasingly politically aware. She soon became the director of the John Steinbeck Committee, named for the author of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; and by 1940 she was the national spokesperson for migrants.

===Appointments and activities===
The Douglases joined the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League; in 1939, they joined others in calling for a United States boycott against goods produced in Nazi Germany.

Gahagan Douglas was a member of the national advisory committee of the Works Progress Administration and of the State committee of the National Youth Administration in 1939 and 1940. She then served as Democratic national committeewoman for California and vice chairwoman of the Democratic state central committee and chairman of the women&#x27;s division from 1940 to 1944. She was also a member of the board of governors of the California Housing and Planning Association in 1942 and 1943, and was appointed by Roosevelt as a member of the Voluntary Participation Committee, Office of Civilian Defense. She was later appointed by President Harry S. Truman as an alternate United States delegate to the United Nations Assembly.

In 1946, she was among those honored by the National Association of Colored Women for her role in interracial cooperation for advancing race and gender equality. Gahagan Douglas had been a colleague of the organization&#x27;s founder, Mary McLeod Bethune, on the National Youth Administration.

===House of Representatives===
In 1943, Democratic leaders, including FDR, persuaded Gahagan Douglas to run in the 1944 election for the 14th Congressional District seat opened by the retirement of Congressman Thomas F. Ford. To try to appeal to conservative voters, she started using her husband&#x27;s last name. As the California Democratic committee chairwoman, she spoke at the 1944 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Her impressive speech raised her profile, with some imagining a VP spot in her future, if not a presidential candidacy. In the fall elections, Gahagan Douglas won the House race and subsequently ran for — and won — two more terms, serving in the 79th, 80th and 81st Congresses (January 1945 – January 1951).

During her three terms in the House, she championed various issues, such as civil rights, migrant worker welfare, women&#x27;s issues, affordable housing, progressive taxation, and nuclear disarmament; she sponsored an anti-lynching bill against Southern opposition. She also championed a controversial bill to create a Franklin Delano Roosevelt National Forest that would protect California redwoods from Sonoma County to Oregon. The forest bill was opposed locally by business interests fearing the loss of taxable properties.

Her love affair with Lyndon B. Johnson was an open secret on Capitol Hill.
===1950 U.S. Senate campaign===
In 1950, Gahagan Douglas ran for the United States Senate, although incumbent Democrat Sheridan Downey was seeking a third term. California Democratic state chairman William M. Malone had advised Gahagan Douglas to wait until 1952 to run for the Senate, rather than split the party in a fight with Downey. Gahagan Douglas, however, told Malone that Downey had neglected veterans and small growers and had to be unseated. Downey withdrew from the race before the primary and supported a third candidate, Manchester Boddy, the owner and publisher of the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;. When Gahagan Douglas defeated Boddy for the nomination, Downey endorsed the Republican nominee, U.S. Representative Richard M. Nixon.

Fellow Representative John F. Kennedy quietly donated money to Nixon&#x27;s campaign against Gahagan Douglas, Kennedy and Nixon sharing similar views on the threat of communism.

In the primary race, Boddy had referred to Gahagan Douglas as &quot;the Pink Lady&quot; and said that she was &quot;pink right down to her underwear&quot;, a suggestion that she sympathized with the Soviet Union. During the general election, Nixon reprised Boddy&#x27;s line of attack. Nixon&#x27;s campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, had 500,000 flyers printed on sheets of pink paper. Chotiner explained, &quot;The purpose of an election is not to defeat your opponent, but to destroy him.&quot;

In a race that was remembered as one of the most vicious in California political history, Nixon&#x27;s charges were intentionally directed towards the assassination of Gahagan Douglas&#x27;s character. He implied that she was a Communist &quot;fellow traveler&quot; by comparing her votes to those of Representative Vito Marcantonio of New York (a pro-Soviet member of the American Labor Party), and deployed anti-Semitic surrogates to call on voters to reject her because her husband, Melvyn, was Jewish. Gahagan Douglas, in return, popularized a nickname for Nixon (apparently coined by Manchester Boddy) which became one of the most enduring nicknames in American politics: &quot;Tricky Dick&quot;.

Nixon won the election by a vote of 2,183,454 (59%) to 1,502,507 (41%), and Gahagan Douglas&#x27;s political career came to an end, but she remained an activist, continuing to advocate for the regulation of nuclear weapons for several decades. In the 1950 election, conservative Democrat Samuel W. Yorty (later a Republican convert) succeeded her in Congress.

Gahagan Douglas would later say that Nixon&#x27;s harsh campaign tactics were &quot;completely unnecessary&quot; and that she was probably going to lose the election anyway. Young, Republican-inclined voters in the state could feel a closer personal connection to Nixon, a thirty-something man with a young family much like themselves. They perceived Gahagan Douglas as too liberal and stuck in the New Deal era. Further, money from oil companies was pouring into the state to tilt the balance in favor of Nixon.

==Later life==
It was rumored that Gahagan Douglas would have been given a political appointment in the Truman administration, but that the Nixon–Douglas race had made such an appointment too controversial for Truman. Democratic National Committee vice-chair India Edwards, a Gahagan Douglas supporter, remarked that Gahagan Douglas could not have been appointed dogcatcher.

She returned to acting in 1952, and later campaigned for John F. Kennedy, who ran successfully against Nixon in the 1960 presidential race.

Gahagan Douglas was mentioned in the 1965 song &quot;George Murphy&quot; by satirist Tom Lehrer. The song begins, &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s often tried to mix / show business with politics / from Helen Gahagan / to Ronald Reagan ...&quot;

Kennedy&#x27;s successor Lyndon Johnson appointed Gahagan Douglas as &quot;Special Ambassador&quot; to the inauguration of Liberian President William Tubman. However, Gahagan Douglas&#x27;s subsequent opposition to the Vietnam War angered Johnson, estranging him from her. She also campaigned for George McGovern in his unsuccessful bid to prevent Nixon&#x27;s 1972 re-election, and she called for Nixon&#x27;s removal from office during the Watergate scandal.

During and after the Watergate scandal, bumper stickers featuring the legend &quot;Don&#x27;t blame me, I voted for Helen Gahagan Douglas&quot; cropped up on cars in California. In October 1973, Gahagan Douglas was among the first women featured on the cover of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine. At its 1979 commencement ceremonies, Barnard College awarded Gahagan Douglas its highest honor, the Barnard Medal of Distinction. She died the following year from breast and lung cancer, with her husband Melvyn by her side.

==Legacy==
Senator Alan Cranston of California eulogized her on the floor of the Senate on August 5, 1980, saying, &quot;I believe Helen Gahagan Douglas was one of the grandest, most eloquent, deepest-thinking people we have had in American politics. She stands among the best of our 20th-century leaders, rivaling even Eleanor Roosevelt in stature, compassion and simple greatness.&quot;

A collection of Helen Gahagan Douglas&#x27;s papers spanning her life and career are held by the Carl Albert Center.

<text>The Battle of Dos Ríos was fought in Cuba during its war of independence from Spain.

==History==
José Martí died fighting in the battle of Dos Ríos (near Palma Soriano). He was leading a group of rebels against the Spanish royalist army in the first skirmish in Cuba&#x27;s struggle for independence from Spain (see History of Cuba). An attempt to recover Martí&#x27;s body was made by the rebels but the Spanish forces were too strong. Spanish forces buried José Martí; the body was subsequently exhumed and reburied with an elaborate funeral in Santiago de Cuba in 1951.

<doc id="382958" wikidata="Q60528603" url="?curid=382958" title="Contamination">
<text>Contamination is the presence of a constituent, impurity, or some other undesirable element that renders something unsuitable, unfit or harmful for physical body, natural environment, , etc.

==Types of contamination==
Within the sciences, the word &quot;contamination&quot; can take on a variety of subtle differences in meaning, whether the contaminant is a solid or a liquid, as well as the variance of environment the contaminant is found to be in. A contaminant may even be more abstract, as in the case of an unwanted energy source that may interfere with a process. The following represent examples of different types of contamination based on these and other variances.

===Chemical contamination===
In chemistry, the term &quot;contamination&quot; usually describes a single constituent, but in specialized fields the term can also mean chemical mixtures, even up to the level of cellular materials. All chemicals contain some level of impurity. Contamination may be recognized or not and may become an issue if the impure chemical causes additional chemical reactions when mixed with other chemicals or mixtures. Chemical reactions resulting from the presence of an impurity may at times be beneficial, in which case the label &quot;contaminant&quot; may be replaced with &quot;reactant&quot; or &quot;catalyst.&quot; (This may be true even in physical chemistry, where, for example, the introduction of an impurity in an intrinsic semiconductor positively increases conductivity.) If the additional reactions are detrimental, other terms are often applied such as &quot;toxin&quot;, &quot;poison&quot;, or pollutant, depending on the type of molecule involved. Chemical decontamination of substance can be achieved through decomposition, neutralization, and physical processes, though a clear understanding of the underlying chemistry is required. Contamination of pharmaceutics and therapeutics is notoriously dangerous and creates both perceptual and technical challenges.

===Environmental contamination===
In environmental chemistry, the term &quot;contamination&quot; is in some cases virtually equivalent to pollution, where the main interest is the harm done on a large scale to humans, organisms, or environments. An environmental contaminant may be chemical in nature, though it may also be a biological (pathogenic bacteria, virus, invasive species) or physical (energy) agent. Environmental monitoring is one mechanism available to scientists to detect contamination activities early before they become too detrimental.

====Agricultural contamination====

Another type of environmental contaminant can be found in the form of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), specifically when they come in contact with organic agriculture. This sort of contamination can result in the decertification of a farm. This sort of contamination can at times be difficult to control, necessitating mechanisms for compensating farmers where there has been contamination by GMOs. A Parliamentary Inquiry in Western Australia considered a range of options for compensating farmers whose farms had been contaminated by GMOs but ultimately settled on recommending no action.

===Food, beverage, and pharmaceutical contamination===

In food chemistry and medicinal chemistry, the term &quot;contamination&quot; is used to describe harmful intrusions, such as the presence of toxins or pathogens in food or pharmaceutical drugs.

===Radioactive contamination===
In environments where nuclear safety and radiation protection are required, radioactive contamination is a concern. Radioactive substances can appear on surfaces, or within solids, liquids, or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable, and processes can give rise to their presence in such places. Several examples of radioactive contamination include:

* residual radioactive material remaining at a site after the completion of decommissioning of a site where there was a nuclear reactor, such as a power plant, experimental reactor, isotope reactor, or a nuclear powered ship or submarine
* ingested or absorbed radioactive material that contaminates a biological entity, whether unintentionally or intentionally (such as with radiopharmaceuticals
* escape of elements after nuclear accident, such as the contamination of Iodine-131 and Caesium-137 after the nuclear disaster in Chernobyl, Ukraine.

Note that the term &quot;radioactive contamination&quot; may have a connotation that is not intended. The term refers only to the presence of radioactivity and gives no indication itself of the magnitude of the hazard involved. However, radioactivity can be measured as a quantity in a given location or on a surface, or on a unit area of a surface, such as a square meter or centimeter.

Like environmental monitoring, radiation monitoring can be employed to catch contamination-causing activities before much harm.

===Interplanetary contamination===
Interplanetary contamination occurs when a planetary body is biologically contaminated by a space probe or spacecraft, either deliberately or unintentionally. This can work both on arrival to the foreign planetary body and upon return to Earth.

===Contaminated evidence===

In forensic science, evidence can become contaminated. Contamination of fingerprints, hair, skin, or DNA—from first responders or from sources not related to the ongoing investigation, such as family members or friends of the victim who are not suspects—can lead to wrongful convictions, mistrials, or dismissal of evidence.

===Contaminated samples===

In the biological sciences, accidental introduction of &quot;foreign&quot; material can seriously distort the results of experiments where small samples are used. In cases where the contaminant is a living microorganism, it can often multiply to dominate the sample and render it useless, as in contaminated cell culture lines. A similar affect can be seen in geology, geochemistry, and archaeology, where even a few grains of a material can distort results of sophisticated experiments.

== Food contaminant detection method ==
The conventional food contaminant test methods may be limited by complicated/tedious sample preparing procedure, long testing time, sumptuous instrument, and professional operator. However, some rapid, novel, sensitive, and easy to use and affordable methods were developed including:

* Cyanidin quantification by naphthalimide-based azo dye colorimetric probe.
* Lead quantification by modified immunoassay test strip based on a heterogeneously sized gold amplified probe.
* Microbial toxin by HPLC with UV-Vis or fluorescence detection and competitive immunoassays with ELISA configuration.
* Bacterial virulence genes detection reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and DNA colony hybridization.
* Pesticide detection and quantification by strip-based immunoassay, a test strip based on functionalized AuNPs, and test strip, surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (SERS).
* Enrofloxacin (chickens antibiotic) quantification by a Ru(phen)3 2+- doped silica fluorescent nanoparticle (NP) based immunochromatographic test strip and a portable fluorescent strip reader.
* Nitrite quantification by The PRhB-based electrochemical sensors and Ion selective electrodes (ISEs).

<doc id="382961" wikidata="Q711594" url="?curid=382961" title="Roy Urquhart">
<text>Major-General Robert Elliot &quot;Roy&quot; Urquhart, (28 November 1901 – 13 December 1988) was a British Army officer who saw service during the Second World War and Malayan Emergency. He became prominent for his role as General Officer Commanding the 1st Airborne Division, which fought with great distinction, although suffering very severe casualties, in the Battle of Arnhem during Operation Market Garden in September 1944.

==Early life and military career==
Roy Urquhart was born in Shepperton, Middlesex, England, on 28 November 1901, and was the son of a Scottish doctor. He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Urquhart was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the 1st Battalion, Highland Light Infantry on 24 December 1920. 

On 24 December 1922, he was promoted to lieutenant, and captain on 26 March 1929. Urquhart was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, when he was stationed in Malta from 1933 to 1936. He also served as an adjutant, and befriended David Niven during this time. Niven recalled Urquhart, in his autobiography &quot;The Moon&#x27;s a Balloon&quot;, as &quot;a serious soldier of great charm and warmth&quot;. 

Urquhart attended the Staff College, Camberley, from 1936 to 1937, and then returned to the 2nd Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Horatio Berney-Ficklin. At that time, it was based in Palestine and served during the Arab revolt. 

On 1 August 1938, Urquhart was promoted to major. He was then dispatched to India as a staff officer, and in May 1939 became the Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General to Army HQ, India.
==Second World War==
When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, Urquhart was still serving in India. He remained there until 1941, when he was posted to North Africa. He was then sent back to the United Kingdom, as a staff officer in the 3rd Infantry Division. Thereafter, his career accelerated. Between 1941 and 1942 he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel, and commanded the 2nd Battalion, Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry until 1942. Then he was appointed as a staff officer in the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, which was then stationed in the United Kingdom before moving to North Africa in mid-1942. For a short time, after being promoted to brigadier, he commanded the 231st Infantry Brigade, which saw action during the Allied invasion of Sicily and in the early stages of the Italian Campaign. He then returned to England.

===Arnhem===

On return, he was assigned to XII Corps as a staff officer. In 1944, he was given command of the 1st Airborne Division. Urquhart was prone to airsickness, and had not commanded or been a member of an airborne formation. Although a newcomer, Urquhart commanded his division during Operation Market Garden in September 1944. The division was dropped into Arnhem, Netherlands, in an attempt to secure a crossing over the River Rhine. For nine days Urquhart&#x27;s division fought unsupported against armoured units of II SS Panzer Corps and suffered increasingly heavy casualties during the Battle of Arnhem. On 25 September, the remnants of the division withdrew across the Rhine. During the battle, the 1st Airborne Division had lost over three-quarters of its strength. Shattered as a fighting formation, the division was withdrawn to the United Kingdom and saw no further action in the war. Urquhart was awarded the Dutch Bronze Lion.

===Norway===


In May 1945, following the German surrender, Urquhart led the 1st Airborne Division, as the advanced guard of Force 134, during Operation Doomsday, the Allied reoccupation of Norway. He was charged with supervising the surrender of the German forces, as well as preventing the sabotage of vital military and civilian facilities. Due to delays in troop arrivals, Urquhart ended up driving into Oslo in a captured German staff car, accompanied only by four military policemen and two infantry platoons. Until the arrival of the Headquarters of Allied Forces, Norway, Urquhart had complete control over all Norwegian activities. As a result, Urquhart welcomed Crown Prince Olaf of Norway, and three ministers representing the Norwegian Government, when they arrived on a Royal Navy cruiser. General Sir Andrew Thorne arrived on 13 May, and assumed command of Allied forces. At the end of August, the 1st Airborne Division and Urquhart returned to the United Kingdom where his division was disbanded in November. Urquhart was awarded the Norwegian Order of St. Olav, for his role in the liberation of the country.

==Post-war service==
Following the end of the war, Urquhart became Director of the Territorial Army and Army Cadet Force at the War Office. He was then made General Officer Commanding, of the newly raised Territorial Army 16th Airborne Division in 1947. This was followed by command of the 51st/52nd Scottish Division until 1950. He was subsequently appointed as the General Officer Commanding Malaya Command during the Malayan Emergency and GOC-in-C British Troops in Austria. He retired from the army in 1955.

==Later life==
After leaving the army, Urquhart became an executive in the heavy engineering industry, and retired in 1970. Urquhart was portrayed by Sean Connery in the 1977 film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;, for which he himself served as a military consultant.

Urquhart and his wife Pamela had four children, among them Elspeth Campbell (wife of the former leader of the Liberal Democrat party Menzies Campbell) and Suki Urquhart, author of &quot;The Scottish Gardener&quot;, third wife of Keith Schellenberg. In his memoirs, Campbell wrote that Urquhart told Elspeth&#x27;s first husband, Philip Grant-Suttie, &quot;there&#x27;s no need to be formal; just call me General&quot;, and that he also insisted on tasting all the food and champagne for Elspeth and Menzies&#x27; wedding before paying for it.

Urquhart died on 13 December 1988, aged 87.

<text>The Vinča culture , also known as Turdaș culture, Turdaș–Vinča culture or Vinča-Turdaș culture, is a Neolithic archaeological culture of Southeast Europe, dated to the period 5400–4500 BC. It is named for its type site, Vinča-Belo Brdo, a large tell settlement discovered by Serbian archaeologist Miloje Vasić in 1908. As with other cultures, it is mainly distinguished by its settlement pattern and ritual behaviour. It was particularly noted for its distinctive dark-burnished pottery.

Farming technology first introduced to the region during the First Temperate Neolithic was developed further by the Vinča culture. This fuelled a population boom that produced some of the largest settlements in prehistoric Europe. These settlements maintained a high degree of cultural uniformity through the long-distance exchange of ritual items, but were probably not politically unified. 

Various styles of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines were hallmarks of the culture, as are the Vinča symbols, which some conjecture to be the earliest form of proto-writing. Although the Vinča culture has not been conventionally considered to be part of the Chalcolithic or &quot;Copper Age&quot;, it featured the earliest known example of copper smelting.

==Geography and demographics==
The Vinča culture occupied a region of Southeastern Europe (i.e. the Balkans) corresponding mainly to modern-day Serbia and Kosovo, but also parts of Southernmost Hungary, Western-Central Romania (Oltenia, Transylvania), Western Bulgaria, Eastern Croatia, Eastern Bosnia, Northern Montenegro and North Macedonia. John Chapman (1981) previously included Greece and excluded Hungary and Croatia (as new findings and conclusions were not known at the time).

This region had already been settled by farming societies of the First Temperate Neolithic (such as the Starčevo culture) and during the Neolithic demographic transition, population sizes started to grow. During the Vinča period, improvements in technology and changes styles of pottery accelerated. Sustained population growth led to an unprecedented level of settlement size and density. Areas that were bypassed by earlier settlers were also settled. Vinča settlements were considerably larger than almost all other contemporary European culture (with the exception of Cucuteni–Trypillia culture), and in some instances their size surpassed the cities of the Aegean and early Near Eastern Bronze Age a millennium later. Settlement sizes may be grouped into 1-1.9 ha, 4-4.9 ha and 20-29 ha. One of the largest sites was Vinča-Belo Brdo (today a suburb of Belgrade in Serbia), covering with up to 2,500 people.

Early Vinča settlement population density was 50–200 people per hectare, in later phases an average of 50–100 people per hectare was common. The Divostin site was occupied twice between 4900 and 4650 B.C. and an estimate based on 17 houses suggests that given a lifespan per house of 56 years. 1028 houses were built on the site during that period with a final population size estimated to be between 868 and 2864. Another large site was Crkvine-Stubline from 4850/4800 BC. it may have contained a maximum population of 4,000. The settlement of Parţa maybe had 1,575 people living there at the same time. It is considered that alike the Neolithic-Chalcolithic Age &quot;there is no evidence for any proto-urbanism nor specialised military, religious or administrative centres&quot;, but their settlements did have defensive formations.

==Origin==
The origins of the Vinča culture are still debated and there exist two mainstream theories, as stated by Marko Porčić (2016), &quot;currently there is no sufficient evidence to accept or to reject out any of the hypotheses proposed for the issue of Vinča culture origins&quot;. It is also debatable whether it can be conceptually considered as a &quot;culture&quot; or a &quot;phenomenon&quot;.

The first hypothesis is that the Vinča culture developed locally from the preceding Neolithic Starčevo culture—first proposed by Colin Renfrew (1969) and Ruth Tringham (1971)—and it became accepted by many scholars, showing &quot;strong links with the contemporaneous Karanovo (phases III to Kodžadermen-Gumelnita-Karanovo VI) in Bulgaria, Precucuteni-Tripolye A in Moldavia and Ukraine, Dimini in Greece, and the late manifestations of the Starčevo culture and early Sopot culture in eastern Croatia&quot;. However, the evidence is not conclusive, and according to recent research &quot;the earliest Vinča sites in the south seem to be as early as those in the north&quot; and have lack of local continuity.

According to the second hypothesis—first proposed by V. Gordon Childe (1929) and Milutin Garašanin (1982)—on the basis of typological similarities, paleodemography and archaeogenetics, the Vinča culture and those of &#x27;Dark Burnished Ware&#x27; developed by a second wave population movement from Anatolia to the Balkans after happened demographic-cultural decline and discontinuity between Early-Late Neolithic in the Central Balkans. Recent studies suggest possibility of both local and migration origin, also related to the emergence of Dudești and Boian culture in Romania, or a combination of both origins.

===Archaeogenetics===
The 2017 and 2018 archaeogenetic studies on 15 samples show that all except one belonged to the paternal Y-DNA haplogroup G-M201 (G2a2a; G2a2a1; 2x G2a2a1a; G2a2b2a1a-PF3346), while the remaining sample belonged to haplogroup H-P96. Their maternal mtDNA haplogroups belonged to H, H3h2, H26, HV, K1a1, K1a4, K2a, T2b, T2c1, and U2 respectively. According to ADMIXTURE analysis they had approximately 90-97% Early European Farmers, 0-12% Western Hunter-Gatherer and 0-8% Western Steppe Herders-related ancestry, and were closest &quot;to the samples from Neolithic Anatolia and to those of Transdanubia LBK and Starčevo, and from the Early Neolithic period from Germany ... consistent with the presumed direction of Neolithic demic movement from Anatolia through the Balkans to central Europe&quot;.

A 2021 study found that Neolithic farmers, including those of the Vinča culture, produced much less cytokine levels for inflammation than earlier hunter-gatherers, which evolutionary introduction to the European genomic heritage helps the immune system of modern Europeans.

==Chronology==
There exist several divisions of the culture, according to J. Chapman (1981) it can be divided into two main phases divided into four sub-phases (A-D), closely linked with those of its type site Vinča-Belo Brdo and dated between 5700 and 4200 BC. According to the most recent radiocarbon dating based on 76 dates (1996) Vinča-Belo Brdo spanned between 5200 and 4500 BC; on 155 dates (2009) it was dated between 5400/5300-4650/4600 BC; and on 600 dates (2016) it was concluded that the culture existed between 5400/5300 and 4500 BC.

In the Vinča C phase happened many significant changes to pottery style, settlement and pyrometallurgical activities and increase in ritual figurines among others because of which it is also called as &quot;Vinča C shock&quot; and &quot;Gradac Phase&quot; (Vinča B2-C1). The phenomenon was particularly strong in the South-Moravian and Kosovian variation of the culture.

===Decline===
In its late Vinča D phase the centre of the Vinča network shifted from Vinča-Belo Brdo to Vršac, and the long-distance exchange of obsidian and &quot;Spondylus&quot; artefacts from modern-day Hungary and the Aegean respectively became more important than that of Vinča figurines. Eventually the network lost its cohesion altogether and fell into decline. It is likely that, after two millennia of intensive farming, economic stresses caused by decreasing soil fertility were partly responsible for this decline.

According to Marija Gimbutas, the Vinča culture was part of Old Europe – a relatively homogeneous, peaceful and matrifocal culture that occupied Europe during the Neolithic. According to this hypothesis its period of decline was followed by an invasion of warlike, horse-riding Proto-Indo-European tribes from the Pontic–Caspian steppe. However, this &quot;New Age sentiment&quot; viewpoint was prevalent until 1990s when started to emerge evidences of violent massacres and defensively-enclosed fortified settlements in Neolithic period.

==Economy==

===Subsistence===
Most people in Vinča settlements would have been occupied with the provision of food. They practised a mixed subsistence economy where agriculture, animal husbandry and hunting and foraging all contributed to the diet of the growing Vinča population. Compared to earlier cultures of the First Temperate Neolithic (FTN) these practices were intensified, with increasing specialisation on high-yield cereal crops and the secondary products of domesticated animals, consistent with the increased population density. In the late Vinča period (Vinča D; c. 4850-4500 cal BC) appeared first toggling harpoon.

Vinča agriculture introduced common wheat, oat and flax to temperate Europe, and made greater use of barley than the cultures of the FTN. These innovations increased crop yields and allowed the manufacture of clothes made from plant textiles as well as animal products (i.e. leather and wool). There is indirect evidence that Vinča farmers made use of the cattle-driven plough, which would have had a major effect on the amount of human labour required for agriculture as well as opening up new area of land for farming. Many of the largest Vinča sites occupy regions dominated by soil types that would have required ploughing.

Areas with less arable potential were exploited through transhumant pastoralism, where groups from the lowland villages moved their livestock to nearby upland areas on a seasonal basis. Cattle were more important than sheep and goats in Vinča herds and, in comparison to the cultures of the FTN, livestock was increasingly kept for milk, leather and as draft animals, rather than solely for meat. Seasonal movement to upland areas was also motivated by the exploitation of stone and mineral resources. Where these were especially rich permanent upland settlements were established, which would have relied more heavily on pastoralism for subsistence.

Although increasingly focused on domesticated plants and animals, the Vinča subsistence economy still made use of wild food resources. The hunting of deer, boar and aurochs, fishing of carp and catfish, shell-collecting, fowling and foraging of wild cereals, forest fruits and nuts made up a significant part of the diet at some Vinča sites. These, however, were in the minority; settlements were invariably located with agricultural rather than wild food potential in mind, and wild resources were usually underexploited unless the area was low in arable productivity.

===Industry===
Generally speaking craft production within the Vinča network was carried out at the household level; there is little evidence for individual economic specialisation. Nevertheless, some Vinča artefacts were made with considerable levels of technical skill. A two-stage method was used to produce pottery with a polished, multi-coloured finish, known as &#x27;Black-topped&#x27; and &#x27;Rainbow Ware&#x27;. Sometimes powdered cinnabar and limonite were applied to the fired clay for decoration. The style of Vinča clothing can be inferred from figurines depicted with open-necked tunics and decorated skirts. Cloth was woven from both flax and wool (with flax becoming more important in the later Vinča period), and buttons made from shell or stone were also used.

The Vinča site of Pločnik has produced the earliest example of copper tools in the world. However, the people of the Vinča network practised only an early and limited form of metallurgy. Copper ores were mined on a large scale at sites like Rudna Glava, but only a fraction were smelted and cast into metal artefacts – and these were ornaments and trinkets rather than functional tools, which continued to be made from chipped stone, bone and antler. It is likely that the primary use of mined ores was in their powdered form, in the production of pottery or as bodily decoration.

<doc id="382966" wikidata="Q388368" url="?curid=382966" title="Solnhofen Limestone">
<text>The Solnhofen Limestone or Solnhofen Plattenkalk, formally known as the Altmühltal Formation, is a Jurassic Konservat-Lagerstätte that preserves a rare assemblage of fossilized organisms, including highly detailed imprints of soft bodied organisms such as sea jellies. The most familiar fossils of the Solnhofen Plattenkalk include the early feathered theropod dinosaur &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; preserved in such detail that they are among the most famous and most beautiful fossils in the world. The Solnhofen beds lie in the German state of Bavaria (Bayern), halfway between Nuremberg (Nürnberg) and Munich (München) and were originally quarried as a source of lithographic limestone. The Jura Museum situated in Eichstätt, Germany has an extensive exhibit of Jurassic fossils from the quarries of Solnhofen and surroundings, including marine reptiles, pterosaurs, and one specimen of the early bird &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;.

== Paleoenvironment and preservation ==
During the Late Jurassic, this area was an archipelago at the edge of the Tethys Sea. This included placid lagoons that had limited access to the open sea and where salinity rose high enough that the resulting brine could not support life. Since the lowest water was devoid of oxygen, many ordinary scavengers were absent. Any organism that fell, drifted, or was washed into the lagoons from the ocean or the land became buried in soft carbonate mud. Thus, many delicate creatures avoided consumption by scavengers or being torn apart by currents. The wings of dragonflies, the imprints of stray feathers, and terrestrial plants that washed into the lagoons were all preserved. The fossils are not numerous, but some of them are spectacular, and their range gives a comprehensive picture of a local Jurassic ecosystem.

At times, the lagoons almost dried out, exposing sticky carbonate muds that trapped insects and a few small dinosaurs. Over 600 species have been identified, including twenty-nine kinds of pterosaur ranging from the size of a sparrow to 1.2 m (4 ft) in length.

The fine-grained texture of the mud silt forming the limestone from the Solnhofen area (which is composed mainly of the towns of Solnhofen and Eichstätt) is ideal for making lithographic plates, and extensive quarrying in the 19th century revealed many fossil finds, as commemorated in the name &quot;Archaeopteryx lithographica&quot;, all the specimens of which come from these deposits. The closest modern analogue to the Solnhofen conditions is said to be Orca Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico, though that area is much deeper than the Solnhofen lagoons.

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of the locality being a &#x27;first-class paleontological site displaying high-quality reference material for scientists worldwide, including all known specimens of &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; &#x27;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included the &#x27;Jurassic Solnhofen-Eichstätt Archaeopteryx Serial Site&#x27; in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &#x27;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&#x27;

== Paleobiota ==

Significant members of the Solnhofen paleofauna include &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, pterosaurs, and marine invertebrates.

== Psilomelane dendrites ==

Dendrites, branched dark brown to black fractal tree-structure, are quite common in the limestone. Such formations are not plant fossil remains, but iron and manganese oxides (psilomelane, ) that crystallized out of solutions on bedding planes of the Solnhofen limestone. Dendrites have a chemical-mineralogical origin and are formed by a diffusion process.

<text>Cebu Air, Inc. (), operating as Cebu Pacific (stylized in lowercase), is a Philippine low-cost airline based at Pasay in Metro Manila. Founded in 1988, the airline was the first low-cost carrier in Asia and is also the largest airline in the Philippines by fleet size. It offers scheduled flights to both domestic and international destinations. The airline operates flights from five bases in Cebu, Clark, Davao, Iloilo, and its largest base in Manila. 

With its low-cost business model and extensive destination network, Cebu Pacific became the Philippines&#x27; largest airline based on number of passengers flown on domestic and international routes in 2010, overtaking rival Philippine Airlines (PAL). According to Civil Aeronautics Board data, Cebu Pacific flew a total of 2.45 million passengers in the first quarter of 2010, nearly 110,000 more than PAL, which carried 2.34 million systemwide during the same period.

The airline has often been criticized for its frequent flight delays and cancellations, some without explanation, as well as alleged poor customer service, prompting investigations by the Philippine government.

== History ==
=== Foundation and growth (1988–2006) ===
Cebu Pacific was established on August 26, 1988. Republic Act No. 7151, which grants a legislative franchise to Cebu Air, Inc. to operate, was approved on August 30, 1991. The airline began operations on March 8, 1996, with its first flight from Manila to Cebu. Domestic services began following market deregulation by the Philippine government. The airline was subsequently acquired by JG Summit Holdings, owned at the time by John Gokongwei.

The airline temporarily ceased operations in February 1998 after being grounded by the government following the crash of the crash of Flight 387 that killed 104, but resumed services later the next month following re-certification of its aircraft. It initially started with 24 domestic flights daily among Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, and Metro Davao. By the end of 2001, its operations had grown to about 80 daily flights to 18 domestic destinations.

In the 2000s, Cebu Pacific was granted rights to operate international flights to the region, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Guam. International flights were launched on November 22, 2001, with a twice-daily service to Hong Kong. Thrice-weekly flights to Seoul commenced on March 1, 2002, followed by Singapore on October 1. Other regional flights were introduced and suspended later; however, including flights to Singapore (from November 6, 2002, to January 2003) and from Manila via Subic to Seoul (from December 2002) due in part to the effects of the SARS epidemic.

On November 10, 2005, Cebu Pacific launched &quot;Go&quot;, a fare discount program that permanently reduced its fares by half. The move was done to increase the airline&#x27;s revenue by twenty percent. Following this, Cebu Pacific experienced significant passenger growth, hiking up its sales volume by ninety percent. Its president and CEO, Lance Gokongwei, anticipated that with the low fares, air travel would be cheaper than sea travel. He further added that:
The airline resumed its Manila–Singapore flights on August 31, 2006, and launched a direct flight from Cebu to Singapore on October 23. It was the first low-cost airline to serve the Cebu-Singapore-Cebu sector, and competing directly with Singapore Airlines subsidiary SilkAir, the only Philippine carrier serving the route for years until Philippine Airlines resumed direct service in 2017. Cebu Pacific&#x27;s direct Cebu–Hong Kong flights began on October 2, 2006, making it the Philippine carrier to serve the Cebu-Hong Kong-Cebu route after PAL terminated its direct service and began code-sharing with Cathay Pacific on the route. Manila–Bangkok flights were also launched in the same year.

=== Initial expansion (2007–2011) ===
In April 2008, Cebu Pacific launched direct flights to its first two destinations in Vietnam: Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

On May 8, 2008, Cebu Pacific opened Francisco Bangoy International Airport in Davao City as its third hub and launched direct flights from Davao to Singapore, Hong Kong, and Iloilo. In late 2007, Cebu Pacific announced plans to launch non-stop flights to the United States West Coast, Houston, and Chicago by mid-2009.

Cebu Pacific&#x27;s plans to begin international flights from Clark in 2007 were initially unsuccessful when its request was denied. The nations involved came to an agreement that Cebu Pacific would be only allowed to operate charter flights from Clark to the respective countries&#x27; airport(s). Only Singapore initially agreed to allow Cebu Pacific to fly scheduled flights from Clark. After launching flights between Clark and Cebu in 2006, on November 8, 2008, the airline commenced international flights from Clark to Hong Kong, Macau, Bangkok and Singapore, making Clark its fourth hub.

On May 28, 2008, Cebu Pacific was named as the world&#x27;s number one airline in terms of growth. The airline was also ranked fifth in Asia for Budget Airline passengers transported and 23rd in the world. On November 20, 2008, it started operating direct flights to Japan, starting with Osaka.

In August 2009, Cebu Pacific became the first airline in the Philippines to use social media; the airline created a fan page on Facebook and Twitter. In October 2010, the airline completed an initial public offering of 30.4% of outstanding shares, raising prior to an exercise of an overallotment option. By January 2011, the airline flew its 50 millionth passenger from Manila to Beijing.

=== Further growth and re-branding (2012–2020) ===
Cebu Pacific continued its network expansion in the 2010s. Continuing its regional expansion, it launched flights to Siem Reap and Xiamen in 2012. Domestically, it opened two local bases in Kalibo and Iloilo. It also expanded its Japanese operations, launching flights to Tokyo and Nagoya in March 2014, followed by Fukuoka in December 2015.

After taking delivery of its first two Airbus A330-300s, Cebu Pacific commenced international long-haul flights on October 7, 2013, to Dubai. Between 2014 and 2015, it launched flights to more destinations in the Middle East, including Kuwait City, Doha, Dammam, and Riyadh. It also launched flights to Sydney—its first destination in Australia—followed by Melbourne in 2018. All Middle Eastern destinations, except Dubai, were terminated in 2017.

On January 8, 2015, the airline flew its 100 millionth passenger. On June 1, Cebu Pacific revealed its new logo that represents the colors of the Philippines and also symbolizes as an evolution of a low-cost pioneer. The airline received its first Airbus A320 painted in the new livery on January 22, 2016.

In March 2016, Cebu Pacific launched flights to Guam, making it the first and only destination in the United States. This route was suspended in December 2019, along with Siem Reap.

On October 20, 2017, Cebu Pacific opened Laguindingan Airport as its seventh base. On the same day, it flew its 150 millionth passenger to Cagayan de Oro. In 2018, Cebgo, Cebu Pacific&#x27;s regional subsidiary, launched flights to Basco, Batanes.

=== COVID-19 and subsequent recovery (2020–present) ===
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the operations of Cebu Pacific in 2020, causing a three-month suspension of operations during the enhanced community quarantine in Luzon and a reduction of its workforce. Due to low passenger demand, the airline laid off 1,300 employees that year, and sent fourteen aircraft to indefinite storage in Alice Springs. In 2021, Cebu Pacific raised a total of (US$) to help the airline recover from the pandemic.

On March 8, 2021, Cebu Pacific celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary.

As travel demand recovers, it started rehiring retrenched employees in November 2021. In March 2022, Cebu Pacific flew its 200 millionth passenger from Manila to Cebu. By December 2022, the airline operated at 92% of pre-pandemic levels. That same year, after three consecutive financial years of losses, Cebu Pacific reported its first full-year post-pandemic profit.

In January 2023, Cebu Pacific resumed flights to China, with the exception of Beijing. On April 21, 2023, Cebu Pacific reopened its Pampanga hub at Clark International Airport. On July 16, 2024, it expanded its Bangkok operations by launching thrice-weekly flights to Don Mueang International Airport to complement its twice-daily Suvarnabhumi flights.

On February 28, 2024, Cebu Pacific was awarded the Best Airline award at the Routes Asia Awards 2024 for its &quot;exceptional contributions to airport and destination marketing in the Asia Pacific region&quot;. It was also awarded Best Low-Cost Airline Brand and Most Sustainable Low-Cost Airline in the Philippines for 2023 by the World Economic Magazine.

In July 2024, Cebu Pacific shelved its plans to expand its long-haul operations. It then reduced its flights to China due to weak demand amid geopolitical tensions, and likewise terminated flights to Beijing. The airline focused instead on expanding regionally within a five-hour radius, launching flights to secondary cities in Southeast Asia. As part of its regional expansion, it started flying thrice weekly to Da Nang on December 7, 2023, and Chiang Mai on October 29, 2024. It also returned to Kaohsiung after a fifteen-year hiatus in August.

Contiuning its domestic expansion, Cebu Pacific expanded its regional network in Visayas and Mindanao, launching eighteen new inter-island routes from its hubs in Cebu, Davao City, and Iloilo, as well as select flights from Clark. Likewise, new international services from these hubs were either launched or revived: new direct flights from Cebu to Bangkok (Don Mueang) and Osaka began in mid-October, while Davao–Hong Kong services were relaunched in the same month including a new Davao–Bangkok service. It also resumed international flights from Iloilo International Airport after a four-year hiatus.

On December 11, 2024, Cebu Pacific flew its 250 millionth passenger from Singapore to Manila. On January 16, 2025, it launched direct flights to Sapporo.

===Partnerships===
Cebu Pacific was the only Philippines-based member airline of Northwest Airlines&#x27; WorldPerks award travel program. WorldPerks offered regular travelers the ability to obtain free tickets, first-class upgrades on flights and other types of rewards. On August 1, 2006, Northwest and Cebu Pacific ended their mileage-accrual agreement.

On May 16, 2016, Cebu Pacific became a founding member of the world&#x27;s largest low-cost carrier alliance, Value Alliance. It joined other pioneer members Singapore&#x27;s Scoot, South Korea&#x27;s Jeju Air, Thailand&#x27;s Nok Air and NokScoot, Tigerair, Tigerair Australia, and Japan&#x27;s Vanilla Air in the low-cost carrier network. Cebu Pacific is also currently the only Philippine carrier which is a member of an airline alliance.

=== Subsidiaries ===

===Business highlights===
===Environmental initiatives===
As part of the airline&#x27;s modernization and environmental initiatives, Cebu Pacific is replacing its existing aircraft with new fuel-efficient aircraft specifically the Airbus A320neo family by 2028, marketing the initiative as a pathway to &quot;&quot;Experience a&quot; &quot;Neo Way to Fly&quot;&quot;. In addition, the airline used sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initially on its delivery flights, before using SAF on a commercial passenger flight from Singapore to Manila on September 28, 2022, using an Airbus A321neo. The airline also signed a five-year agreement with Shell Aviation that would supply 25,000 metric tons of SAF to Cebu Pacific.

On November 3, 2022, Cebu Pacific received the Asia Environmental Sustainability Airline/Airline Group of the Year award from the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) for its green initiative efforts in aviation industry.

On October 19, 2023, Cebu Pacific signed another five-year agreement with Neste, one of the largest producers of sustainable aviation fuel. The airline then completed its second SAF-powered flight on October 25, from Narita International Airport to Manila, also performed by an A321neo.

On February 15, 2024, Cebu Pacific earned a Gold rating in the 2023 CAPA-Envest Global Airline Sustainability Benchmarking Report for integrating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in its operations and its outstanding performance in reducing carbon emissions. In addition to its CAPA Gold rating, CEB improved its S&amp;P Global ESG Score to 41 in 2023 from 38 in 2022, ranking in the 69th percentile among the 63 airlines assessed by the international financial market intelligence provider.

=== Fleet development ===
Cebu Pacific initially operated a fleet of Boeing 757-200 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9 aircraft. By March 2006, it phased out its 757s, and on July 26, 2006, retired its last DC-9.

In September 2004, Cebu Pacific signed a purchase agreement with Airbus for the acquisition of twelve A319s and the lease of two A320s to replace its existing fleet of Boeing 757-200 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9 aircraft. It selected the CFM56 for its Airbus aircraft. It took delivery of its first A320-200 in May 2005. The airline went on to order more A320s in the following years, raising its total orders to twenty-two by 2010. The A320s supported the airline&#x27;s expanding international and domestic operations.

Turboprops were introduced to the fleet in 2007, when Cebu Pacific ordered six ATR 72-500 turboprop aircraft for its regional domestic flights. By 2015, these were transferred to its regional subsidiary Cebgo, with Cebu Pacific operating mainly jet aircraft.

In 2007, the airline ordered six Airbus A330-300s for use on long-haul Middle Eastern destinations such as Dubai as well as high-density regional flights. Cebu Pacific received its first A330-300 on June 15, 2013. In 2016, the carrier ordered two more A330s to complement earlier fleet in operating new long-haul routes, such as Sydney and Melbourne.

In June 2011, Cebu Pacific ordered 30 Airbus A321neos including nine leased; the deal was finalized in August. After initial deliveries in 2017 were delayed due to problems with the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1100G-JM geared turbofan engines, it ordered seven A321-200s on June 7, 2017. Cebu Pacific took delivery of its first A321ceo on March 22, 2018, followed by its first A321neo on January 20, 2019.

In July 2018, Cebu Pacific leased five Airbus A320neos from Avolon; the first of which was delivered in June 2019.

On June 18, 2019, Cebu Pacific ordered 31 Airbus aircraft at that year&#x27;s Paris Air Show, consisting of five A320neos, sixteen A330-900s, and ten A321XLRs, in a deal worth US$6.8 billion at list prices. This makes the airline as one of the few launch customers of the long-range narrow-body Airbus A321XLR aircraft. These were ordered as part of its fleet modernization, seeking to replace its older fleet with newer, fuel-efficient aircraft. It took delivery of its first A330neo on November 28, 2021.

On June 30, 2023, the airline took delivery of its first Airbus plane assembled in China — an A320neo built at its final assembly line at Tianjin Binhai International Airport, leased from Clover Aviation Capital.

To prepare for the anticipated doubling of travel demand in Southeast Asia, Cebu Pacific sent requests for proposals to Airbus and Boeing in October 2023 for an order 100 to 150 aircraft. Amid supply chain problems causing delivery delays of Airbus aircraft and the engine problems of Pratt &amp; Whitney, Cebu Pacific considered ordering the Boeing 737 MAX to augment its existing A320 family fleet. Nevertheless, on July 2, 2024, it signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Airbus to purchase up to 152 A320neo family aircraft. Worth US$24 billion at list prices, the order is the largest in Philippine aviation history. Eventually, Cebu Pacific placed 70 firm orders for the A321neo on October 2, leaving the remaining 82 as options.

From January to May 2024, Cebu Pacific damp-leased two A320-200s from Bulgaria Air for use on domestic flights to Cebu and Davao City to offset the grounding of its A320neo family aircraft.

==Criticism==
Cebu Pacific has been criticized for its poor passenger service, alleged overbooking, as well as flight delays and cancellations without any verifiable reason. For instance, the airline was also criticized for lack of coordination in the aftermath of the runway excursion incident at Francisco Bangoy International Airport in 2013 and the numerous flight cancellations and delays during the December 2014 Christmas peak season which cost the airline a fine.

In January 2018, Cebu Pacific was named as one of the world&#x27;s least punctual airlines, with an on-time performance of 57.6 percent in 2017 based on data from OAG. Also included in the list from the Philippines is another low-cost airline, Philippines AirAsia, with an on-time performance of 58.0 percent.

During the &quot;Super Pass&quot; voucher sale in March 2023, Cebu Pacific was criticized for system glitches that caused transaction errors and additional charges. In the aftermath of these complaints, on April 23, 2023, Senator Nancy Binay filed a resolution for a full inquiry on passengers&#x27; complaints on the airline. In the Senate hearing on June 21, Binay compiled over 3,000 complaints against Cebu Pacific, including offloaded passengers, as well as several delayed, cancelled, or rescheduled flights without unclear or no explanations; some of the complainants were allegedly not given compensation for the delays. The airline blamed on supply chain issues and grounded aircraft as a result of the disruptions, and apologized to affected passengers.

In October 2024, Cebu Pacific was criticized for its mishandling of baggage delays caused by technical problems of the baggage handling system at Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3.

<doc id="382970" wikidata="Q1578799" url="?curid=382970" title="Trichophagia">
<text>Trichophagia is a form of disordered eating in which persons with the disorder suck on, chew, swallow, or otherwise eat hair. The term is derived from ancient Greek θρίξ, (&quot;hair&quot;) and φαγεῖν, (&quot;to eat&quot;). Tricho-phagy refers only to the chewing of hair, whereas tricho-phagia is ingestion of hair, but many texts refer to both habits as just trichophagia. It is considered a chronic psychiatric disorder of impulse control. Trichophagia belongs to a subset of pica disorders and is often associated with trichotillomania, the compulsive pulling out of ones own hair. People with trichotillomania often also have trichophagia, with estimates ranging from 48-58% having an oral habit such as biting or chewing (i.e. trichophagy), and 4-20% actually swallowing and ingesting their hair (true trichophagia). Extreme cases have been reported in which patients consume hair found in the surrounding environment, including other people&#x27;s and animals&#x27; hair. In an even smaller subset of people with trichotillomania, their trichophagia can become so severe that they develop a hairball. Termed a trichobezoar, these masses can be benign, or cause significant health concerns and require emergency surgery to remove them. Rapunzel syndrome is a further complication whereby the hairball extends past the stomach and can cause blockages of gastrointestinal system.

Trichophagia occurs instinctively in many animal species and is not always a sign of a psychological disorder. Cats practice trichophagia as a form of regular grooming. 

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms of trichophagia are variable depending on the individual&#x27;s behavior patterns. Trichophagia&#x27;s loosest definition is the putting of hair in one&#x27;s mouth, whether that be to chew it or suck on it, with the strictest definition being that the hair is swallowed and ingested. Trichophagia is most closely associated with trichotillomania, the pulling out of one&#x27;s own hair, and thus any symptoms of trichotillomania could be predictive of trichophagia and must be ruled out. Rarely, persons with trichophagia do not exclusively have trichotillomania and instead will eat the hair of others.

Trichotillomania can be categorized as either &quot;automatic&quot;, where the hair pulling is so habitual it is almost unconscious, or &quot;focused&quot;, where the pulling is more deliberate, with the focused behavior thought to be more common among those with trichophagia. Once the hair has been pulled out, persons with trichophagia might rub the hair against their lips, roll the hairs around and inspect them, bite off and swallow the bulb of the hair, or ingest the entire hair shaft as well. Typically, ingested hair remains asymptomatic and is not harmful. However, if trichophagia is severe or chronic, a large mass of undigested hair can accumulate in the stomach, resulting in a trichobezoar. This can be symptomatic, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Once the trichobezoar grows large enough, it can extend beyond the stomach and lead to bowel obstructions, ulcers, perforations, acute pancreatitis and appendicitis (this is called Rapunzel syndrome).

Along with the physical harm caused by the pulling out and ingestion of hair, the unpleasant symptoms and social stigma surrounding trichophagia negatively affect the quality of life of sufferers, leading to shame, guilt, and impairment of social functioning. In one study, it was found that a significant percentage of patients with trichotillomania used drugs and alcohol to cope with negative feelings relating to pulling behaviors, with most sufferers reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression. It is important for physicians to recognize and treat these secondary symptoms in order to relieve hair-pulling and eating behaviors.

== Epidemiology ==
Trichophagia is estimated to have a prevalence of 0.6% in the general population with the most restrictive definition of hair ingestion, but looser definitions which are inclusive of sucking and chewing without swallowing, can be as high as 3.2%. Its prevalence among patients with trichotillomania is estimated to be around 37.5%, with 33% developing trichobezoars. Trichophagia can present at any age, with childhood cases typically being more common and of a more habitual nature, while in adulthood it is associated with underlying psychopathologies and more severe symptoms. Among childhood cases the distribution between males and females is equal. However, in adolescents and adults, trichophagia is increasingly common among females, with a distribution of cases of 15:1, female-to-male. Highest prevalence is in young adults.

Many of the prevalence rates are thought to be underestimates due to stigma and inconsistent definitions of trichophagia. Moreover, the discrepancy between rates in women and men could be explained by underreporting in men, either due to additional shame for men or the ease of shaving and hiding their underlying trichotillomania. Trichophagia in men, while more rarely reported, is often more severe.

== Etiology ==
Several etiological causes for trichotillomania and trichophagia have been hypothesized, suggesting that symptoms may be caused by disordered emotional regulation, autostimulation mechanisms, a response to stressors, behavioral conditioning, or addiction. Research has also shown that there is a genetic component to the disorders; trichotillomania patients are more likely to have relatives who suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder, excoriation disorder, and major depressive disorder. Decreased distress tolerance and increased impulsivity were also found in trichotillomania patients with a family history of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

== Comorbid Psychopathologies ==
When assessing patients with trichophagia, common comorbid psychopathologies are anxiety disorders, eating disorders, depressive disorders, and addiction. More comorbid psychopathologies are associated with more severe symptoms of trichotillomania and trichophagia. The association between trichotillomania, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and related body-focused repetitive behaviors has been of particular interest to researchers, with studies finding that those with both trichotillomania and obsessive-compulsive disorder have higher levels of anxiety and depression as opposed to those who only suffer from trichotillomania. The commonality of comorbid psychopathologies in individuals with trichotillomania and trichophagia could be indirectly caused by the social rejection sufferers face due to their symptoms. Researchers suggest that bringing awareness of the disorders to the general population could help relieve the stigmas faced by patients.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of trichophagia can be difficult, as the behavior is easy to hide, and because of shame, individuals rarely admit they have trichophagia, even if they have stopped engaging in its related behaviors. Often, individuals only seek medical help after they have developed gastrointestinal problems caused by a trichobezoar. Any patient who has confirmed trichotillomania should be screened for trichophagia. Some symptoms, such as hair loss, can be caused by other somatic conditions, the presence of which needs to be excluded before a diagnosis of trichotillomania or trichophagia.

== Treatment ==
Psychotherapy has been widely used in the treatment of trichotillomania and trichophagia, with evidence supporting cognitive behavioral therapy, habit-reversal training, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy as being effective treatments. The most commonly used clinical treatment is the prescription of selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine and clomipramine, but the effectiveness of this treatment has not been supported empirically. Evidence for efficacy has been found in studies using non-SSRIS, including N-acetylcysteine and olanzapine.

==Prognosis==
Rapunzel syndrome, an extreme form of trichobezoar in which the &quot;tail&quot; of the hair ball extends into the intestines, and can be fatal if misdiagnosed. In some cases, surgery may be required to remove the mass. In one case, a trichobezoar weighing was removed from the stomach of an 18-year-old woman with trichophagia.

==History==
Trichophagia and trichobezoars have been documented by physicians for centuries, even long before a medical definition was established for trichotillomania. For example, in the 18th century, French doctor M. Baudamant described the condition in a 16-year-old boy. Trichophagia is most often covered in the medical literature only &quot;as a rare symptom of trichotillomania.&quot; 

Despite its appearance in medical literature over the centuries, little research was conducted on trichophagia until the past decade. Even now, most research focuses on Western cultures and European hair textures, with other groups with distinct hair textures, styles, and cultures, such as African Americans, often overlooked.

==In media==
Trichophagia is mentioned in the &quot;1000 Ways to Die&quot; episode &quot;Stupid Is As Stupid Dies&quot; featuring a young woman who died from it. It is also mentioned in &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; season 9 episode 11 &quot;The End Is the Beginning Is the End&quot;. As well as Season 3 episode 16 of &quot;The Resident&quot;, “Reverse Cinderella.”

<text>The Metropolitan Tabernacle is a large independent Reformed Baptist church in the Elephant and Castle in London. It was the largest non-conformist church of its day in 1861. The Tabernacle fellowship has been worshipping together since 1650. Its first pastor was William Rider; other notable pastors and preachers include Benjamin Keach, John Gill, John Rippon and C. H. Spurgeon. The present pastor is Peter Masters.

==History==
The Tabernacle fellowship dates back to 1650, when the English Parliament banned independent Christian organisations from meeting together. This congregation braved persecution until 1688, when the Baptists were once again allowed to worship in freedom. At this point, the group built their first chapel, in Horsleydown, Southwark, an area of London immediately south of the present-day Tower Bridge.

In 1720, John Gill became pastor and served for 51 years. In 1771, John Rippon became pastor and served for 63 years. During these times, the church experienced growth and became one of the largest congregations in the country. Afterwards decline set in and by 1850 the congregation was small.

In 1854, Charles Haddon Spurgeon started serving at the Tabernacle at the age of 20. The church at the beginning of Spurgeon&#x27;s pastorate was situated at New Park Street Chapel, but this soon became so full that services had to be held in hired halls such as the Surrey Gardens Music Hall.
During Spurgeon&#x27;s ministry, it was decided that the church should move permanently to larger premises. The location chosen was at Elephant and Castle, a prominent position near the River Thames in South London, partly because it was thought to be the site of the burning of the Southwark Martyrs. The building, with a 6,000-seat auditorium, designed by William Willmer Pocock, was finished in 1861 and dedicated on 18 March. In 1881, the church had 5,500 members.

Spurgeon also founded a college for preachers and church workers (now Spurgeon&#x27;s College), and orphanages for girls and boys, and wrote many Christian books which are still in print today.
In 1887, the church left the Baptist Union because of the widening influence of theological liberalism within the union. Spurgeon was adamant that the church would not &quot;downgrade&quot; the faith as he believed other baptist churches were doing.

At the end of 1891, membership was given as 5,311. Spurgeon served for 38 years and died in 1892.

The original building was burned down in 1898, leaving just the front portico and basement intact, before the rebuilt church was destroyed again in 1941 during the German bombing of London in World War II. Once again, the portico and basement survived and in 1957 the Tabernacle was rebuilt to a new but much smaller design incorporating surviving original features.

The war led to the Tabernacle fellowship being greatly diminished as few members of the old congregation were able to return to heavily blitzed central London. It rejoined the Baptist Union in 1955. By 1970 the congregation had fallen to the point where it occupied only a few pews. It left the Baptist Union again on 22 February 1971, just after Peter Masters became the pastor, over the same issues as under Spurgeon in 1887. Numbers greatly increased and this gave rise to the full church and galleries of today, together with numerous professions of faith. It hosts an annual school of theology, runs a part-time seminary for pastors, has five Sunday schools, and provides free video and audio downloads, along with live-streaming of services. By 2009 The Guardian reported that Metropolitan Tabernacle attracted up to 500 people in its main service.

<doc id="382974" wikidata="Q3296146" url="?curid=382974" title="Mary Ann Bickerdyke">
<text>Mary Ann Bickerdyke (July 19, 1817 – November 8, 1901), also known as Mother Bickerdyke, was a hospital administrator for Union soldiers during the American Civil War and a lifelong advocate for veterans. She was responsible for establishing 300 field hospitals during the war and served as a lawyer assisting veterans and their families with obtaining pensions after the war.

==Early life==
Mary Ann Ball was born on July 19, 1817, in Knox County, Ohio, to Hiram and Annie Rodgers Ball. She is cited as one of the first women who attended Oberlin College in Ohio, but official records show no proof of attendance. In 1847, she married Robert Bickerdyke, who died in 1859, two years before the Civil War. Together, the Bickerdykes had two sons.

She later moved to Galesburg, Illinois, where she worked as botanic physician and primarily worked with alternative medicines using herbs and plants. Bickerdyke began to attend the Congregational Church in Galesburg shortly after she became a widow.

==Civil War service==
Mary Bickerdyke served in the Civil War from June 9, 1861, to March 20, 1865, working in a total of nineteen battles. Bickerdyke was described as a determined nurse who did not let anyone stand in the way of her duties. Her patients, the enlisted soldiers, referred to her as &quot;Mother&quot; Bickerdyke because of her caring nature. When a surgeon questioned her authority to take some action, she replied, &quot;On the authority of Lord God Almighty, have you anything that outranks that?&quot; In reality, her authority came from her reputation with the Sanitary Commission and her popularity with the enlisted men.

Dr. Woodward, a surgeon with the 22nd Illinois Infantry and a friend of Bickerdyke&#x27;s, wrote home about the filthy, chaotic military hospitals at Cairo, Illinois. The letter was read aloud in their church and Galesburg&#x27;s citizens collected $500 worth of supplies and selected Bickerdyke to deliver them (no one else would go). After meeting Mary Livermore, she was appointed a field agent for the Northwestern branch of the Sanitary Commission. Livermore also helped Bickerdyke find care for her two sons in Beloit, Wisconsin, while she was in the field with the army during the later part of the war. Her sons complained about living in Beloit. She stayed in Cairo as a nurse, and while there, she organized the hospitals and gained Grant&#x27;s appreciation. Grant endorsed her efforts and detailed soldiers to her hospital train, and when his army moved down the Mississippi, Bickerdyke went, too, setting up hospitals where they were needed. Bickerdyke became a matron of the hospital in only five months.

She later joined a field hospital at Fort Donelson, working alongside Mary J. Safford. Bickerdyke cites Fort Donelson, specifically February 15 and 16, as the first battle she witnessed. At Fort Donelson, she realized that laundry services were lacking in the field hospitals. She packed up the soiled clothes and bedding that had been used by the men, added disinfectants, and sent it on a steamer bound for Pittsburg Landing to be cleaned by the Chicago Sanitary Commission. She also requested that her colleagues in Chicago send washing machines, portable kettles, and mangles. She then organized escaped and former slaves to provide laundry services for the hospitals she set up in the field.

After serving at Fort Donelson, she was appointed matron at Gayoso Block Hospital in Memphis. Gayoso had 900 patients, including 400 Native Americans. Like her other hospitals, &quot;Mother&quot; Bickerdyke employed escaped and former slaves at Gayoso. She had left Gayoso to run errands and returned to find the medical director had sent away the escaped and former slaves who helped her provide care for the hospital&#x27;s patients. She left for dinner but did not return right away. Rather, she visited General Hurlbut&#x27;s headquarters. She was given written authority to keep her employees until such time as Hurlbut himself revoked the order. She also set about acquiring cows and hens to provide dairy products for the hospital. General Hurlbut set aside President&#x27;s Island for their pasture and the escaped and former slaves cared for the animals.

Bickerdyke also worked closely with Eliza Emily Chappell Porter of Chicago&#x27;s Northwestern branch of the United States Sanitary Commission. She later worked on the first hospital boat. During the war, she became chief of nursing under the command of General Ulysses S. Grant, and served at the Battle of Vicksburg. As chief of nursing, Bickerdyke sometimes deliberately ignored military procedure, and when Grant&#x27;s staff complained about her behavior, Union Gen. William T. Sherman reportedly threw up his hands and exclaimed, &quot;She outranks me. I can&#x27;t do a thing in the world.&quot; Sherman acknowledged that she was &quot;one of his best generals&quot; and other officers referred to her as the &quot;Brigadier Commanding Hospitals.&quot; Sherman was especially fond of this volunteer nurse, who followed the western armies. Bickerdyke held the favor of both General Sherman and General Grant, who often provided her whatever she requested of them.

On October 27, 1863, Bickerdyke reported to Chattanooga and was witness to the battle of Lookout Mountain, nicknamed &quot;the battle above the clouds.&quot; &quot;I watched the dreadful combat until the clouds hid all from view,&quot; she wrote in a letter to Mary Holland, &quot;In fancy I can hear General Hooker&#x27;s artillery now.&quot; Bickerdyke set up the field hospital of the Fifteenth Army Corps for the Battle of Missionary Ridge, where she was the only female attendant for four weeks. Part of her work during this campaign was to collect personal items of soldiers killed in battle and return them to the soldiers&#x27; homes. On the march to capture Atlanta, Georgia, despite General Sherman&#x27;s orders to inflict &quot;all the damage you can against [the enemy&#x27;s] war resource,&quot; Bickerdyke worked to build hospitals for Confederate soldiers.

By the end of the war, with the help of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, Mother Bickerdyke had built 300 hospitals and aided the wounded on 19 battlefields including the Battle of Shiloh and Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea. &quot;Mother&quot; Bickerdyke was so loved by the army that the soldiers would cheer her when she appeared. At Sherman&#x27;s request, she rode at the head of the XV Corps in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington at the end of the war.

==After the War==

After the war ended, Bickerdyke was employed in several domains. She worked at the Home for the Friendless in Chicago, Illinois in 1866. With the aid of Colonel Charles Hammond, who was president of the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad, she helped fifty veterans&#x27; families move to Salina, Kansas, as homesteaders. She ran a hotel there with the aid of General Sherman. Originally known as the Salina Dining Hall, it came to be called the Bickerdyke House. Later, she became an attorney, helping Union veterans with legal problems, including obtaining pensions.

General Logan helped her get a job in the San Francisco Mint. She also worked for the Salvation Army there. While in California, she was elected as the first president of Lyon Women&#x27;s Relief Corps, No. 6 of Oakland, California. She declined, but is on their membership rolls as a charter member.

Bickerdyke received a special pension of $25 a month from Congress after Mary Livermore lobbied on her behalf. This special bill was introduced by Representative Long of Massachusetts. Generals Grant, Sherman, Pope, and Long testified on it. The bill passed on May 9, 1886.

Bickerdyke retired to Bunker Hill, Kansas, to live with her son. In 1901, she died peacefully after a minor stroke and was buried in Galesburg.

==Legacy==
Bickerdyke is featured in a memoir of the war, written by Mary Livermore and published in 1887, entitled &quot;My Story of the War&quot;. Livermore was an official in the U.S. Sanitation Commission.

Clara Barton wrote a poem entitled &quot;The Women Who Went to the Field&quot; that honored Bickerdyke, Cornelia Hancock, Dorothea Dix, Mary Livermore, and Annie Etheridge.

Statues of her have been erected in Galesburg, Illinois and in Mount Vernon, Ohio. The United States government recognized her military achievements with a hospital ship and liberty ship named the SS &quot;Mary Bickerdyke&quot; launched in October 1943.

The Seminary/Kellogg Street overpass in Galesburg, Illinois opened on November 30, 2014, and is officially named &quot;Bickerdyke Bridge&quot;.

<text>Gaius Marcius Rutilus (also seen as &quot;Rutulus&quot;) was the first plebeian dictator and censor of ancient Rome, and was consul four times.

He was first elected consul in 357 BC, then appointed as dictator the following year in order to deal with an invasion by the Etruscans which had reached as far as the ancient salt-works on the coast. He surprised the enemy&#x27;s camp, captured 8,000 of the enemy and drove the rest out of Roman territory, for which he was granted a triumph by the people, against the Senate&#x27;s wishes.

Rutilus was again elected consul in 352 BC. At the end of his term, he ran for censor and won, despite patrician opposition. He was also consul in 344 BC and 342 BC, when he led the army in the Samnite Wars.

His son of the same name was tribune of the plebs in 311 BC and consul in 310 BC. According to Fergus Millar, this son was one of the first plebeian augurs under the &quot;lex Ogulnia&quot; and also held the position of censor twice, the first time in 294 BC and the second time in 265 BC.

<text>HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot; was one of three s built for the Royal Navy before World War I and had an active career during the war. She tried to hunt down the German battlecruiser and the light cruiser in the Mediterranean Sea when war broke out and she and her sister ship sank the German armoured cruisers and during the Battle of the Falkland Islands. &quot;Inflexible&quot; bombarded Turkish forts in the Dardanelles in 1915, but was damaged by return fire and struck a mine while maneuvering. She had to be beached to prevent her from sinking, but she was patched up and sent to Malta, and then Gibraltar for more permanent repairs. Transferred to the Grand Fleet afterwards, she damaged the German battlecruiser during the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and watched &quot;Invincible&quot; explode. She was deemed obsolete after the war and was sold for scrap in 1921.

==Design==
The &quot;Invincible&quot;-class ships were formally known as armoured cruisers until 1911 when they were redesignated as battlecruisers by an Admiralty order of 24 November 1911. Unofficially a number of designations were used until then, including cruiser-battleship, dreadnought cruiser and battle-cruiser.

===General characteristics===
&quot;Inflexible&quot; was significantly larger than her armoured cruiser predecessors of the . She had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at load and at deep load, nearly more than the earlier ships.

===Propulsion===
&quot;Inflexible&quot; had two paired sets of Parsons direct-drive turbines, each of which was housed in a separate engine-room and drove an outboard and inboard shaft. The high-pressure ahead and astern turbines were coupled to the outboard shafts and the low-pressure turbines to the inner shafts. A cruising turbine was also coupled to each inner shaft; these were not used often and were eventually disconnected. The turbines were powered by thirty-one Yarrow water-tube boilers in four boiler rooms. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , but reached nearly during her trials in 1908. She was designed for , but reached during trials. She carried of coal, and an additional of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full fuel capacity, she could steam for at a speed of .

===Armament===

&quot;Inflexible&quot; mounted eight BL Mk X guns in four twin hydraulically powered turrets. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen QF Mk III guns. In 1915, the turret roof guns were transferred to the superstructure, and the total number of guns was reduced to twelve. All of the remaining guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields at that time to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action. These guns were replaced by twelve 4-inch BL MK IX guns on CPI mountings during 1917.

Her anti-aircraft armament consisted of a single QF 20 cwt AA gun on a high-angle MKII mount at the aft end of the superstructure that was carried from July 1915. A 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun on a high-angle MkIc mounting with a maximum elevation of 60° was fitted in November 1914 and used until August 1917. A 4-inch BL MK VII on a HA MkII mount was added in April 1917. Five  submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the &quot;Invincible&quot;s, two on each side and one in the stern. Fourteen torpedoes were carried for them.

===Armour===
The armour protection given to the &quot;Invincible&quot;s was heavier than that of the &quot;Minotaur&quot;s; their waterline belt measured amidships in contrast to the belt of their predecessors. The belt was 6 inches thick roughly between the fore and aft 12-inch gun turrets, but was reduced to four inches from the fore turret to the bow, but did not extend aft of the rear turret. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour, except for the turret roofs which used of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC). The thickness of the main deck was and the lower deck armour was . Mild steel torpedo bulkheads of 2.5-inch thickness were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms.

After the Battle of Jutland revealed her vulnerability to plunging shellfire, additional armour was added in the area of the magazines and to the turret roofs. The exact thickness is not known, but it was unlikely to be thick as the total amount was less than .

==Construction and career==
She was authorized in the naval expansion program of 1905, and built at the John Brown &amp; Company shipyard on the Clyde. She was laid down on 5 February 1906, launched on 26 June 1907, and commissioned on 20 October 1908. &quot;Inflexible&quot; was initially assigned to the Nore Division of the British Home Fleet. She was the temporary flagship of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Edward Hobart Seymour while in New York for the Hudson–Fulton Celebration in September 1909. On 26 May 1911, she was in a collision with the battleship that damaged her bow. She was refitted in October–November 1911, where her fore funnel was also raised by to reduce smoke interference with the bridge.

===First World War===
====Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau====

On the outbreak of the First World War, &quot;Inflexible&quot; was flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet. Accompanied by , under the command of Admiral Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne she encountered the German battlecruiser and the light cruiser on the morning of 4 August 1914 headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of Philippeville, but Britain and Germany were not yet at war so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to Messina to recoal. All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers, but &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot; were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th. By this time, war had been declared, after the German invasion of Belgium, but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay outside a limit from the Italian coast precluded entrance into the passage of the Strait of Messina where they could observe the port directly. Therefore, Milne stationed &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indefatigable&quot; at the northern exit of the Strait of Messina, still expecting the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports, the light cruiser at the southern exit and sent &quot;Indomitable&quot; to recoal at Bizerte where she was better positioned to react to a German sortie into the Western Mediterranean.

The Germans sortied from Messina on 6 August and headed east, towards Constantinople, trailed by &quot;Gloucester&quot;. Milne, still expecting Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon to turn west, kept the battlecruisers at Malta until shortly after midnight on 8 August when he set sail for Cape Matapan at a leisurely , where &quot;Goeben&quot; had been spotted eight hours earlier. At 14:30, he received an incorrect signal from the Admiralty stating that Britain was at war with Austria; war would not be declared until 12 August and the order was countermanded four hours later, but Milne followed his standing orders to guard the Adriatic against an Austrian breakout attempt, rather than seek &quot;Goeben&quot;. Finally on 9 August, Milne was given clear orders to &quot;chase &quot;Goeben&quot; which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north-east&quot;. Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles, and so he resolved to guard the exit from the Aegean, unaware that the &quot;Goeben&quot; did not intend to come out. &quot;Indomitable&quot; remained in the Mediterranean to blockade the Dardanelles, but &quot;Inflexible&quot; was ordered home on 18 August.

===Battle of the Falklands===

The West Indies Squadron of Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock was destroyed by the German East Asia Squadron commanded by Admiral Graf von Spee during the Battle of Coronel on 1 November 1914. In response, the Admiralty ordered that a squadron be sent to destroy the Germans. The squadron, under the command of Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee, consisted of &quot;Invincible&quot; (flag) and &quot;Inflexible&quot;. They departed on 11 November and rendezvoused with several other cruisers under Rear Admiral Stoddard at Abrolhos Rocks, off the coast of Brazil on the 26th. They departed the following day and reached Port Stanley on the morning of 7 December.

Spee – making a leisurely voyage back to the Atlantic – wished to destroy the radio station at Port Stanley, so he sent the armoured cruiser and the light cruiser to see if the harbor was clear of British warships on the morning of 8 December. They were spotted at 07:30, although the pre-dreadnought , grounded in Stanley Harbor to defend the town and its wireless station, did not receive the signal until 07:45. It mattered little because Sturdee was not expecting an engagement and most of his ships were coaling. Furthermore, the armoured cruiser and the light cruiser had one or both of their engines under repair. The armed merchant cruiser &quot;Macedonian&quot; was patrolling the outer harbor entrance while the armoured cruiser was anchored in the outer harbor, scheduled to relieve the &quot;Macedonian&quot; at 08:00. The Germans were not expecting any resistance and the first salvo from &quot;Canopus&quot;″s guns at 09:20 caused them to sheer off from their planned bombardment of the wireless station and fall back on Spee&#x27;s main body.

Sturdee&#x27;s ships did not sortie from the harbor until 09:50, but they could see the retreating German ships on the southwest horizon. The &quot;Invincible&quot;s, fresh out of dry dock, had a advantage over Spee&#x27;s ships which all had fouled bottoms that limited their speeds to at best. The light cruiser was lagging behind the other ships and &quot;Inflexible&quot; opened fire on her when the range dropped to at 12:55. &quot;Invincible&quot; opened fire shortly afterwards and both ships began straddling &quot;Leipzig&quot; as the range closed to . At 13:20, Spee ordered his squadron to separate and ordered his light cruisers to turn to the southwest while his armoured cruisers turned to the north east to cover their retreat. The German ships opened fire first at 13:30 and scored their first hit at 13:44 when hit &quot;Invincible&quot;, although the shell burst harmlessly on the belt armour. Both sides fired rapidly during the first half-hour of the engagement before Sturdee opened up the range a little to put his ships outside the effective range of the German guns. British gunnery was very poor during this period, scoring only four hits out of 210 rounds fired. The primary cause was the smoke from the guns and funnels as the British were downwind of the Germans.
Spee turned to the south in the hope of disengaging while the British had their vision obscured, but only opened the range to before the British saw his course change. This was futile as the British battlecruisers gave chase at . Forty minutes later, the British opened fire again at . Eight minutes later, Spee turned again to the east to give battle; this time, his strategy was to close the range on the British ships so he could bring his secondary armament to bear. He was successful, and they were able to open fire at 15:00 at maximum elevation. On this course, the smoke bothered both sides, but multiple hits were made regardless. Those made by the Germans either failed to detonate or hit in some insignificant area. On the contrary, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had her starboard engine room put out of action. Sturdee ordered his ships at 15:15 back across their own wakes to gain the windward advantage. Spee turned to the northwest, as if to attempt to cross the British T, but actually to bring &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s undamaged starboard guns to bear as most of those on his port side were out of action. The British continued to hit &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; regularly during this time and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; ceased fire at 16:00 before capsizing at 16:17 with no survivors. &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had been slowed by earlier damage and was battered for another hour and a half by &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot; at ranges down to . Despite the damage her crew continued to fire back until she ceased firing at 16:47. Sturdee was ready to order &#x27;Cease fire&#x27; at 17:15 when an ammunition hoist was freed up and she made her last shot. The British continued to pound her until 17:50, after her captain had given the order to scuttle her at 17:40. She slowly capsized at 18:00 and the British were able to rescue 176 men. She had fired 661 twelve-inch shells during the battle and had only been hit three times because she was often obscured by &quot;Invincible&quot;″s smoke. Only one man was killed and five wounded aboard the battlecruisers during the battle.

===Dardanelles Campaign===

After the Battle of the Falklands &quot;Inflexible&quot; was repaired and refitted at Gibraltar. She arrived at the Dardanelles on 24 January 1915 where she replaced &quot;Indefatigable&quot; as the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet. She bombarded Turkish fortifications on 19 February, the start of the Battle of Gallipoli, to little effect, and again on 15 March, with the same results. She was part of the first line of British ships on 18 March as they attempted to suppress the Turkish guns so the minefields could be swept. Turkish return fire was heavy and she was hit a number of times. A howitzer shell knocked out the left gun of &#x27;P&#x27; turret, a shell hit the yard above the foretop and killed or wounded everybody within. A heavy shell of unknown size hit her on the port side below the waterline, but only dished in the side plating. A shell hit the foremast at the same level as the flying bridge and set fire to the navigator&#x27;s sea cabin. The hit destroyed all the cables and voice pipes running through the foremast to the fire control director. The smoke from the fire was choking the wounded so she withdrew to turn her head into the wind and the fire was then quickly put out. She returned to reengage the Turkish forts and was hit once more with little effect. Later, as she was turning in Eren Keui Bay, she was seriously damaged by a mine – probably about in size – that blew a large hole in her starboard bow and flooded the forward torpedo flat, drowning 39 men. She had to be beached at the island of Bozcaada (Tenedos) to prevent her sinking, as she had taken in some of water, but she was temporarily repaired with a cofferdam over the hole. She sailed to Malta, escorted by and on 6 April. She nearly foundered when her cofferdam worked loose in heavy weather &quot;en route&quot; and had to be towed stern-first by &quot;Canopus&quot; for six hours while the cofferdam was repaired. She was under repair at Malta until early June before she sailed for home. She reached the U.K. on 19 June, where she joined the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) of the Grand Fleet under the command of Rear Admiral H.L.A. Hood.

===Battle of Jutland===

At the end of May 1916, the 3rd BCS was temporarily assigned to the Grand Fleet for gunnery practice. On 30 May, the entire Grand Fleet, along with Admiral Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, was ordered to sea to prepare for an excursion by the German High Seas Fleet. In order to support Beatty, Admiral Hood took his three battlecruisers ahead of the Grand Fleet. At about 14:30, &quot;Invincible&quot; intercepted a radio message from the light cruiser , attached to Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Force, reporting the sighting of two enemy cruisers. This was amplified by other reports of seven enemy ships steering north. Hood interpreted this as an attempt to escape through the Skagerrak and ordered an increase in speed to at 15:11 and steered East-Southeast to cut off the fleeing ships. Twenty minutes later, &quot;Invincible&quot; intercepted a message from Beatty reporting five enemy battlecruisers in sight and later signals reporting that he was engaging the enemy on a south-easterly course. At 16:06, Hood ordered full speed and a course of south-southeast in an attempt to converge on Beatty. At 16:56, with no British ships in sight, Hood requested Beatty&#x27;s course, position and speed, but he never received a reply.

Hood continued on course until 17:40, when gunfire was spotted in the direction to which his light cruiser had been dispatched to investigate other gunfire flashes. &quot;Chester&quot; encountered four light cruisers of Hipper&#x27;s 2nd Scouting Group and was badly damaged before Hood turned to investigate and was able to drive the German cruisers away. At 17:53, &quot;Invincible&quot; opened fire on ; the other two &quot;Invincible&quot;s followed two minutes later. The German ships turned for the south after fruitlessly firing torpedoes at 18:00 and attempted to find shelter in the mist. As they turned, &quot;Invincible&quot; hit &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; in the engine room and knocked out her engines while &quot;Inflexible&quot; hit once. The 2nd Scouting Group was escorted by the light cruiser and 31 destroyers of the 2nd and 9th Flotillas and the 12th Half-Flotilla which attacked the 3rd BCS in succession. They were driven off by Hood&#x27;s remaining light cruiser and the five destroyers of his escort. In a confused action, the Germans only launched 12 torpedoes and disabled the destroyer with gunfire. Having turned due west to close on Beatty&#x27;s ships, the &quot;Invincible&quot;s were broadside to the oncoming torpedoes, but &quot;Invincible&quot; turned north, while &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; turned south to present their narrowest profile to the torpedoes. All the torpedoes missed, although one passed underneath &quot;Inflexible&quot; without detonating. As &quot;Invincible&quot; turned north, her helm jammed and she had to come to a stop to fix the problem, but this was quickly done and the squadron reformed heading west.

At 18:21, with both Beatty and the Grand Fleet converging on him, Hood turned south to lead Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers were away and the &quot;Invincible&quot;s almost immediately opened fire on Hipper&#x27;s flagship, , and . &quot;Lützow&quot; quickly took ten hits from , &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot;, including two hits below the waterline forward by &quot;Invincible&quot; that would ultimately doom her. But at 18:30, &quot;Invincible&quot; abruptly appeared as a clear target before &quot;Lützow&quot; and &quot;Derfflinger&quot;. The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at &quot;Invincible&quot;, and sank her in 90 seconds. A 305 mm (12-inch) shell from the third salvo struck the roof of &quot;Invincible&quot;″s midships &#x27;Q&#x27; turret, flash detonated the magazines below, and the ship blew up and broke in two, killing all but six of her crew of 1,032 officers and men, including Rear-Admiral Hood.

&quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; remained in company with Beatty for the rest of the battle. They encountered Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers only away as the sun was setting about 8:19 and opened fire. &quot;Seydlitz&quot; was hit five times before the German battlecruisers were rescued by the appearance of the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve and the British shifted fire to the new threat. Three of the predreadnoughts were hit before they too were able to turn into the gloom.

===Post-Jutland career===

The loss of three battlecruisers at Jutland (the others were and ) led to the force being reorganised into two squadrons, with &quot;Inflexible&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; in the 2nd BCS. However, after Jutland there was little significant naval activity for the &quot;Invincible&quot;s, other than routine patrolling, thanks to the Kaiser&#x27;s order that his ships should not be allowed to go to sea unless assured of victory. Two torpedoes fired by the German U-boat during one of these patrols on 19 August 1916 missed astern. On 1 February 1918, she collided with the British submarine off the Isle of May with minor damage. This was during a night exercise in the Firth of Forth involving the Flotilla, eight capital ships, and numerous cruisers and destroyers. It was a series of collisions which led to the loss of two K boats, serious damage to three others, including K22, and a cruiser, and the deaths of 104 submariners, with no enemy involved. She was fitted with two flying off ramps fitted above her midships turrets in early 1918. On 21 November she was present at Scapa Flow for the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet.

The end of the war saw the end for many of the older vessels, not least the two remaining &quot;Invincible&quot;-class ships. &quot;Inflexible&quot; was paid off to the Reserve Fleet in January 1919 before being decommissioned on 31 March 1920. Chile briefly considered purchasing the ship in 1920, however the sale did not materialise. She was sold for scrap on 1 December 1921, and scrapped in Germany the following year. Mount Inflexible in the Canadian Rockies was named after the battlecruiser in 1917.

<doc id="382989" wikidata="Q3027994" url="?curid=382989" title="Líneas Aéreas Privadas Argentinas">
<text>Líneas Aéreas Privadas Argentinas (), more commonly known by the acronym LAPA (and known as ARG Argentina Línea Privada and AIRG from 2001 to 2002), was an airline based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. At its heyday, the carrier operated international services to the United States and Uruguay, as well as an extensive domestic network within Argentina. Additionally, the company also operated charter services. Domestic and regional flights were operated from downtown&#x27;s Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, whereas an international service to Atlanta was operated from Ministro Pistarini International Airport. LAPA was the first carrier to break a monopolistic market controlled by Aerolíneas Argentinas and its sister company Austral Líneas Aéreas, offering competitive prices.

It ceased operations in April 2003 after declaring bankruptcy.

== History ==
The airline was formed in 1977, initially aimed at providing internal services within the Buenos Aires Province. In May 1978, it was authorised to operate charter services to cities in the Americas, and scheduled services began the following year. By , the major shareholder of the company was Claudio Zichy-Thyssen; the fleet comprised three YS-11As and a Piper Cheyenne that worked on a domestic passenger and cargo network serving Concordia, Ezeiza Airport, Gualeguaychu, La Plata, Necochea, Olavarria, Parana, Pehuajo, San Nicolas and Tres Arroyos. Gustavo Deutsch acquired the company in 1984, when it had a network consisting of two domestic routes served with a single propeller aircraft.

In January 1987, the airline became the first South American operator of the Saab 340. The carrier started a period of major growth in 1993 when it gained permissions to fly to Bariloche, Córdoba, Iguazú and Mar del Plata. A year later, the route network included 17 destinations, served with three aircraft. At , LAPA had 60 employees; the fleet consisted of one Beech B-58 Baron, one Beech King Air 500, two Boeing 737s and two Saab 340s that worked on routes to Bariloche, Colonia, Córdoba, Iguazú, Mar del Plata, Mendoza, Montevideo and Villa Gessel. LAPA became a Boeing 757 operator in September 1995 when it took possession of its first aircraft of the type. By late 1996, LAPA had a 30% of domestic market share.

=== Change of ownership and name ===
On 27 September 2001 the airline changed its name to ARG Argentina Línea Privada following the acquisition of the company by Eduardo Eurnekian. Aircraft were painted in a new livery, displaying the acronym ARG on both sides of the fuselage. This situation prompted an issue with the airline&#x27;s name, as ARG is the ICAO airline code for Aerolíneas Argentinas. In mid-2002 the name of the airline was changed to AIRG. Bolivian airline AeroSur and four Argentine investors acquired the airline on 29 August 2002, and the original name LAPA was restored.

=== Downfall and ceased operations ===
The company filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2001, and ceased operations in April 2003, after three of its five aircraft were repossessed by the lessors.

== Destinations ==
The airline had its heyday following the deregulation of the Argentine air market in 1994; it operated an extensive domestic network, as well as international services to Atlanta, Montevideo and Punta del Este.

The list of destinations served at the time of closure in 2003 were Buenos Aires, Comodoro Rivadavia, Córdoba, El Calafate, Florianópolis, Iguazú, Mendoza, Puerto Madryn, Puerto Montt, Salta, San Carlos de Bariloche, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Santiago de Chile, São Paulo, Trelew, Tucumán, and Ushuaia. During the course of its history, LAPA served the following destinations:

== Fleet ==
Prior to its bankruptcy in April 2003, the most modern aircraft in the fleet, such as the brand-new Boeing 737-700s, Boeing 757-200s, as well as a single Boeing 767-300ER the company flew the Buenos Aires–Atlanta route with, were gradually returned to their lessors throughout 2001 and 2002, as their leases proved too expensive. When LAPA ceased operations in April 2003, only three of its remaining five Boeing 737-200 Advanced were operational.

The company operated the following aircraft throughout its history:

*BAC 1-11 400
*Boeing 737-200
*Boeing 737-200 Advanced
*Boeing 737-200C
*Boeing 737-700
*Boeing 757-200
*Boeing 767-300ER
*Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante
*Piper Cheyenne
*Piper Cheyenne II
*Saab 340
*Short 330
*YS-11A-300
== Accidents and incidents ==
*31 August 1999: Flight 3142, a Boeing 737-200C, registration LV-WRZ, that operated a scheduled Buenos Aires–Córdoba passenger service, crashed during takeoff from Aeroparque Jorge Newbery after it failed to get airborne. Unable to stop, the aircraft overshot the runway, hit the perimeter fence at a speed greater than , hit a car while crossing an avenue, collided with a wall and heavy construction machinery, came to rest on a golf course, and burst into flames less than a minute later. Out of 103 occupants of the plane, 63 died in the accident, plus two ground casualties. The accident remains the third deadliest one in the Argentine aviation history, behind Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 644 and Austral Líneas Aéreas Flight 2553.

<text>Project Alpha was an effort by magician James Randi to test the quality of scientific rigor of a well-known test of paranormal phenomena.

In the late 1970s, Randi contacted the newly established McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research (&quot;MacLab&quot;) with suggestions on how to conduct tests for paranormal phenomena. At the same time, two teenage boys (Steve Shaw, later known as Banachek, and Mike Edwards) independently contacted the McDonnell Laboratory and volunteered as subjects for such tests from 1979 to 1982. They quickly proved to exhibit a range of paranormal abilities far and away better than the other subjects of the experiment. The lab began leaking reports of the pair&#x27;s capabilities, which were in fact simple magic tricks.

When rumors of the test subjects&#x27; connection to Randi reached Peter Phillips, head of the MacLab, he instituted tighter protocols for the experiments; the two subjects&#x27; results declined sharply. In 1983, Randi held a press conference to expose the deception in the wake of Project Alpha, as there were a number of controversies about the ethics of interference in scientific research and the validity of paranormal research as it then existed. It remains a watershed event in the field of parapsychology.

== McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research (MacLab) ==
In the 1970s, James Smith McDonnell, board chairman of McDonnell Douglas and believer in the paranormal, approached Washington University in St. Louis with plans to set up a permanent PSI research facility. Eventually, physicist Peter Phillips, who was also interested in the field, agreed to lead a parapsychology lab at the school. Phillips had degrees in physics from both Cambridge University and Stanford University. In 1979, McDonnell arranged a US$500,000 grant for the establishment and five years operation of the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research, or MacLab for short. Phillips was most interested in spoon bending, also known as &quot;psychokinetic metal bending&quot;, or PKMB.

== The Project Alpha experiment ==
In response to the announcement of this venture, James Randi wrote to the lab with a list of 11 pitfalls and his suggestions on how to avoid them. These suggestions included a rigid adherence to the protocol of the test, so that the subjects would not be allowed to change it during the run. In writing about Project Alpha, he cited Uri Geller, who had changed protocols during tests at Stanford Research Institute. Whenever something did not work, Geller simply did something else instead, which the researchers then reported as evidence of a successful experimental result. Other suggestions from Randi included using only one test object at a time, and permanently marking the object or objects used so they could not be switched with similar objects. He also suggested having as few people in the room as possible to avoid distractions. In addition, Randi offered his services to watch the experiments, noting that a conjurer would be an excellent person to look for fakery. According to Michael Thalbourne, Phillips did not take Randi up on the offer because of the magician&#x27;s reputation of being &quot;a showman rather than an unprejudiced critic&quot; and his perceived hostility towards psychic claimants. However, on April 1, 1982, Randi awarded Phillips a Straight Spoon award for reconsidering his position on loose controls after what Randi called a &quot;less-than-enthusiastic reception&quot; for his presentation at the 1981 Parapsychological Association conference.

While testing applicants, the lab started to focus its energies on two young men, Steve Shaw and Mike Edwards, who were much more successful than other applicants. In fact, the two young men were magicians who had each independently contacted Randi when the opening of the laboratory was announced. They offered to participate as test subjects with Randi&#x27;s support. Part of Randi&#x27;s instructions to these men was to tell the truth if ever asked whether they were faking the results. According to Randi, they were never asked this question directly; according to a Washington University spokesman, Fred Volkmann, &quot;Such a confrontation did occur and [Edwards and Shaw] did not own up.&quot; Shaw and Edwards recall that they were not asked whether they worked with Randi, but simply told there were rumors to that effect.

== Steven Shaw and Michael Edwards ==

When the establishment of the laboratory was announced, Mike Edwards, 18, and Steven Shaw, 17, now known as Banachek, both magicians, each contacted Randi independently with a plan. They proposed to use their skills to deceive the researchers with tricks during the first stages of the investigations. They were chosen as test subjects and the hoax began.

The project had originally started with spoon bending, so the two quickly developed a way to accomplish this. Contrary to one of the caveats Randi noted in his letter, the test setup included not one, but many and various spoons, labeled with paper on a loop of string instead of any sort of permanent marking. When starting to bend a spoon, the two magicians would complain the labels were in the way and remove them. They would then simply switch the labels when putting them back and wait. The spoons were measured before and after the experiment, and since all sorts of spoons were used, simply switching the labels would produce different measurements, causing the scientist to believe that something paranormal had occurred. In other cases, they would drop one of the spoons in their lap and bend it below the table with one hand, while pretending to bend a spoon in their other hand, distracting the scientists.

Because the studio was set up to allow people in front of the camera to see themselves on monitors, and the videotapes were available to be watched by anyone, the two used the video to critique their own performance. They would deliberately fail on their first attempt at a demonstration and then use the video to find out what was visible to the researchers and what was not. They would then modify their technique so it would not appear on video. Edwards found that one particular camera operator was on guard to capture any attempts at sleight of hand, so he picked the man to assist him in one experiment, and he was replaced by a less competent cameraman. This was also a breach of Randi&#x27;s caveat of not letting subjects modify anything about the testing protocol; the test run should have been stopped at this point and recorded as a failure.

=== More experiments ===
Edwards and Shaw were so successful at spoon bending that several other tests were invented. In one, they were given pictures in sealed envelopes and then asked to try to identify them from a list shown to them later. The two were left alone in a room with the envelopes. Although there was a possibility that they would peek, this was supposed to be controlled by examining the envelopes later. The envelopes were held closed with four staples, which the magicians simply pried open with their fingernails. They looked at the picture and then resealed the envelope by inserting the staples back into the same holes and forcing them closed by pressing them against the table.

In another test, they were asked to influence the burnout point of a common fuse. After they were given a chance to work it with their mind, an increasing amount of current was run through the fuse until it blew. The two proved to have amazing abilities in this test after a few trials, eventually causing the fuses to blow immediately once they got used to it. In fact, they were palming the already blown fuses and then handing them back to the experimenters. They also found that pressing down on one end of the fuse in its holder, or just touching it briefly, caused the instruments to record unusual results that were interpreted by the experimenters as psi effects.

In yet another instance, Shaw and Edwards were asked to move small objects in a sealed transparent globe, normally small bits of paper balanced on an edge. At first, they were unable to get anything to happen, but then noticed that the container was being removed to replace the object within. During one such event, they took the opportunity to roll up a small ball of metal foil and drop it into the circular ring cut into the surface of the table that held the globe. This introduced a small gap under one edge, which they could blow into to make the paper move. Other examples included their ability to make digital clocks stop working properly (Edwards put one into a microwave oven for a few seconds), or make images appear on film just by staring at the camera (Shaw spat on the lens).

The researchers explained the inadequacies in experimental protocols by drawing a clear distinction between two different stages of an investigation: the exploratory, informal experiments and the formal experiments. During the exploratory phase, the researchers were simply trying to determine whether there was a phenomenon that could be worth further investigation. Later tests would have included the use of much more complicated protocols and expensive equipment. In this way, they were also trying to set up a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere that is believed to be conducive to psychic phenomena. It is during this stage that Shaw and Edwards were able to convince the researchers of their psychic abilities.

== Revelation and aftermath ==
Phillips decided to release a research brief at a workshop of the Parapsychological Association Convention in August 1981. According to the researchers&#x27; official version, in preparation Phillips also wrote to Randi to ask for a tape of fake metal-bending, which was to be shown alongside the recording of Shaw and Edwards. The researchers were looking for critical input from the parapsychology community and afterward released a revised abstract that reflected the received criticism.

After the Project Alpha announcements in the press, Randi wrote to the lab again and stated that it was entirely possible the two were magicians using common sleight of hand to fool the researchers. He also started to leak stories that the two were his plants. The story had been widely circulated by the time the meeting was held the next month. Upon returning from the meeting, Phillips immediately changed the test protocols; Shaw and Edwards found that they were no longer able to fool the experimenters so easily, and in most cases, unable to fool them at all. During this time the lab started releasing additional reports that seriously toned down the success rate. In their own words, &quot;We did not conclude that they must be frauds, but only that after extensive testing, they were not behaving nearly as psychically as they had led us to expect.&quot;

According to Marcello Truzzi, Berthold E. Schwarz was the &quot;chief victim of Project Alpha&quot;. Schwarz had written a monograph on Shaw&#x27;s psychic powers which was withdrawn from publication. Truzzi adds &quot;Dr. Schwarz first became involved with Shaw because Schwarz hoped that Shaw might be able to use PK to help his seriously ill daughter for whom no orthodox medical cure is available.&quot; Shaw states that he was unaware of this agenda of Dr. Schwarz.

== Project Alpha ends ==
In 1983, Randi decided to end the project and announced the entire affair in a press conference and to &quot;Discover&quot; magazine. At the press conference, Randi introduced the two subjects as psychics, and asked how they achieved their results to which Michael Edwards replied, &quot;To be quite honest, we cheat.&quot; Reactions to the deception ranged from the extremely favorable to deplorable.

Martin Gardner referred to the hoax as a landmark. To counter accusations of unethical conduct on Randi&#x27;s part, Gardner cites another similar case, that of the &quot;discovery&quot; of N-rays. Loyd Auerbach, noting the less than forty-eight hour notice given to the laboratory of Randi&#x27;s press conference and the fact that Phillips was not invited to attend it, questioned whether Randi&#x27;s motives were those of scientific research or showmanship.

An internal memo of the United States Central Intelligence Agency accused Randi of &quot;gross distortions&quot;. The memo was written &quot;in anticipation of ... discussions with representatives of Congress&quot; regarding CIA research into paranormal abilities, which was contracted to SRI International, and said &quot;This recent adverse publicity to the field of parapsychology should not have any adverse impact on the GRILL FLAME Project&quot;.

James S. McDonnell, who had provided the money to open the MacLab in 1979, died in on August 22, 1980. In 1985, with no funding forthcoming, the MacLab closed its doors.

Randi viewed Project Alpha as &quot;a great success&quot; that &quot;has resulted in some parapsychologists being more careful about their conclusions&quot;.

<doc id="383002" wikidata="Q801510" url="?curid=383002" title="Tamachi Station (Tokyo)">
<text>is a railway station in the Tamachi neighborhood of Minato, Tokyo, Japan, operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East). It is served by the circular Yamanote Line and the Keihin-Tōhoku Line. All trains stop at this station.

Mita Station on the Asakusa and Mita subway lines is within walking distance, although there is no physical connection and the stations are generally not marked as an interchange on route maps. Tamachi is the nearest JR station to Keio University&#x27;s Mita campus and Temple University Japan&#x27;s Mita and Azabu campuses.

==Station layout==

The station consists of two island platforms providing cross-platform interchange
in the direction of travel between the Yamanote Line (platforms 2 and 3) and the Keihin-Tōhoku Line (platforms 1 and 4). As this is the first cross-platform interchange following the intersection of both lines the platforms are comparatively busy.

Chest-high platform edge doors were installed on the Yamanote Line platforms in February 2013, entering operation in March.


==History==
The Tokaido Main Line opened in 1872 and passed through Tamachi, which was at the time still submerged under Tokyo Bay. The area to the west of the Tokaido Line was filled in by the end of the 19th century, and the east side filled in during the early 1900s. Tamachi Station opened on December 16, 1909 as an intermediate station on the newly opened Shinagawa-Karasumori section of the Yamanote Line, then operated by Japanese National Railways. It was the sixteenth stop to open on the Yamanote Line.

The area surrounding the station was predominantly industrial until the 1970s, with several confectionery, electronics and machinery factories. New development shifted to commercial buildings beginning with the Morinaga Plaza Building in 1970. The west side of Tamachi underwent a major redevelopment from 1988, resulting in the current elevated deck and pedestrian bridge over the adjacent Dai-Ichi Keihin road.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 144,433 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the seventeenth-busiest station operated by JR East.

The passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.

<text>The Royal Courts of Justice, commonly called the Law Courts, is a court building in Westminster which houses the High Court and Court of Appeal of England and Wales. The High Court also sits on circuit and in other major cities. Designed by George Edmund Street, who died before it was completed, it is a large grey stone edifice in the Victorian Gothic Revival style built in the 1870s and opened by Queen Victoria in 1882. It is one of the largest courts in Europe. It is a Grade I listed building.

It is located on the Strand within the City of Westminster, near the boundary with the City of London (Temple Bar). It is surrounded by the four Inns of Court, St Clement Danes church, the Australian High Commission, King&#x27;s College London and the London School of Economics. The nearest London Underground stations are Chancery Lane and Temple. The Central Criminal Court, widely known as the Old Bailey after its street, is about to the east—a Crown Court centre with no direct connection with the Royal Courts of Justice.

== History ==
For centuries these courts were located in Westminster Hall; however, in the 19th century, justices decided the courts needed a purpose-built structure. Much of the preparatory legal work was completed by Edwin Wilkins Field including promotion of the Courts of Justice Building Act 1865 (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. 48) and the Courts of Justice Concentration (Site) Act 1865 (28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. 49). A statue of Field stands in the building. Parliament paid £1,453,000 for the site upon which 450 houses had to be demolished.

The search for a design for the Law Courts was by way of a competition, a then-common approach to selecting a design and an architect. The competition ran from 1866 to 1867 and the twelve architects competing for the contract each submitted designs for the site. In 1868 it was finally decided that George Edmund Street was the winner. Building was started in 1873 by Messrs Bull &amp; Sons of Southampton. Its masons led a serious strike at an early stage which threatened to extend to the other trades and caused a temporary stoppage of the works. In consequence, foreign workmen were brought in – mostly Germans. This aroused bitter hostility on the part of the men on strike, and the newcomers had to be housed and fed within the building. However, these disputes were eventually settled and the building took eight years to complete; it was officially opened by Queen Victoria on 4 December 1882.

Street died before the building was opened, overcome by the work. The building was paid for by cash accumulated in court from the estates of the intestate to the sum of £700,000. Oak work and fittings in the court cost a further £70,000 and with decoration and furnishing the total cost for the building came to under £1 million.

The building was extended to the designs of Sir Henry Tanner to create the West Green building completed in 1912. The Queen&#x27;s Building followed in 1968 and the Thomas More Courts were completed in January 1990.

The building was used as a &quot;Nightingale Court&quot; for criminal trials during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021.

==Architecture==
The design involves a symmetrical main frontage of facing The Strand; the central section, which is stepped back, features an arched doorway leading to the Great Hall; it has a five-part window in a carved surround on the first floor and a gable containing a rose window above. At the top of the gable is a sculpture of Jesus with a flèche behind. There are also statues of Moses, Solomon and Alfred the Great, the four statues symbolising the pillars of English legal tradition. There are towers containing lancet windows on either side of the central section with side wings beyond. At the eastern end of the Strand frontage is a tall clock tower topped by a pyramidal roof, finial and flagpole; it contains a clock and five bells (weighing a total of 8¼ tons) by Gillett, Bland &amp; Co..

Internally, courts are arranged off the Great Hall which runs north–south; there is a courtyard to the east with offices for courtroom staff arranged round the courtyard. The Great Hall contains a bust of Queen Victoria by the sculptor, Alfred Gilbert.

Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner has described the building as &quot;an object lesson in free composition, with none of the symmetry of the classics, yet not undisciplined where symmetry is abandoned&quot;. David Brownlee has claimed that it was influenced by the reformist political movement and the High Victorian architectural movement and has described it as a &quot;regular mongrel affair&quot; while Turnor described it as the &quot;last great secular building of the Gothic Revival&quot;.

The Government Art Collection contains a painting by Henry Tanworth Wells depicting Queen Victoria opening the building in 1882.

<doc id="383005" wikidata="Q1679882" url="?curid=383005" title="James and Browne">
<text>James &amp; Browne was a British automobile manufacturer, based in Hammersmith, London between 1898 and 1910. The enterprise started in 1896 as a partnership between John Melville James, a former racing cyclist, and Tom Bousquet Browne. This partnership was dissolved in 1898 with Browne continuing the business with Francis Leigh Martineau under the James and Browne name.

The James &amp; Browne factory was located at the Chiswick end of King&#x27;s Street in West London, and there was a car showroom on Oxford Street.

The early cars had an unusual engine layout with the flywheel between the cylinders. The engines were mid-mounted in the chassis, and the cylinders were horizontal. Drive was to the rear wheels via a 4-speed gearbox and chain. The gearbox is in 2 parts, linked by a connecting rod, the left one containing 2nd and 4th gear, and the right 1st, 3rd and reverse.

The 2-cylinder engine is rated at 9 HP, and is just over 2.5 liters in size. A total-loss oiling system is used on the car, lubricating 6 main oil-ways. James &amp; Browne also launched a 4-cylinder version (16 HP), of a similar design to the horizontal 2-cylinder engine.

In 1906 a vertical-engined car was introduced known as the Vertex and available as either a 20 hp four or 30/40 hp six-cylinder.

== Surviving cars ==
Only two of their cars are known to have survived, one built in 1902 and the other in 1904. T.B. Browne, one of the company&#x27;s founders, remained interested in the condition of the two surviving cars throughout his life and still regularly met with the owners until the early 1960s.

===1902 model===
The car was built in 1902 and transported by train from the James and Browne works in Hammersmith, London to Albrighton Station, Shropshire. The first owner was Mr. Norman McLean of The Blue House, Tong, Shropshire. Mr. McLean had the car painted in the colours of his stables which were yellow with black lining. The car was then moved to Tong Castle, the home of his fiancée, Miss Hartley. The Hartley family had leased Tong Castle from Lord Bradford since 1855. Miss Hartley’s brother was John Hartley (tennis), the winner of the Wimbledon Gentlemen’s Singles Championship in 1879 and 1880.

Mr. McLean decided that some alterations to the car were required and instructed Mr. Ernest Roy Spencer to carry out the work. The Spencers were blacksmiths and ran their business at 15 Broadway, Shifnal, around three miles from Tong Castle.

In 1910 Mr. McLean decided to sell the car to Ernest Spencer for a nominal sum of £20, and the car was then moved to 15 Broadway, Shifnal. Ernest Spencer decided that Mr. McLean’s colour scheme was too conspicuous for general use and drinking trips, so decided to paint the car battleship grey with black piping. Mr. Spencer intended to convert the car to a pick-up truck for his business and fitted it with magneto ignition and a windscreen. However, with the outbreak of World War I in Summer 1914, the car was mothballed and stored in a shed at the back of the premises and stayed there until 1929.

In 1929 it was decided to enter the car in the Old Crock&#x27;s Run to Brighton. The less permanent alterations to the car were removed and it was returned to as near original condition as possible. The car took part in the Brighton run on Sunday 20 October (entry number 25) and departed from the Mall at around 9am. The car had a good run but lost time when the battery terminals shook loose, and was the fifth car to arrive in Brighton.

In December 1929, ownership of the car passed to Mr. Herbert Ford who purchased the car from the Spencers for the sum of £35. Mr. Ford was a local man and shrewd businessman, and had owned nearby Lilleshall Hall since 1927. In 1930, Mr. Ford opened some pleasure gardens for the public at Lilleshall Hall, and these included an amusement park, narrow gauge railway and children&#x27;s playgrounds. The car was used as an attraction in the amusement park. Mr. Ford and his friend, Mr. T.R. Price, entered the car in the 1933 Brighton Run on Sunday 12 November 1933. The car (entry number 21) completed the run successfully with an average speed of 19.61 mph.

In October 1934 the car was purchased by John Garland, Dick and Edward Riddle, three students at the City and Guilds College, part of Imperial College London. The car has been an active part of college life from 1934 to the present day. The car is still maintained by students and driven in many events including the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run.

===1904 model===
The first owner of the 1904 car was the Rev Dr John Darlington, the vicar of St Mark&#x27;s Church, Kennington in London, who also owned a house in Curry Rivel, near Taunton in Somerset. The Vicar had originally owned a Peugeot which had badly let him down in 1905, and as a friend of his had a reliable two-cylinder James &amp; Browne car he visited the Showroom in Oxford Street and asked to buy a car &quot;like the one my friend owns&quot;. Browne remembered this visit as he had to advise Darlington that the Company had ceased making two-cylinder models in 1904, but he could offer Darlington a new four-cylinder 1905 model. Darlington was adamant that he wanted a two-cylinder car, so it was arranged that an unused two-cylinder engine, gearbox and transmission from the workshop be fitted into a compatible spare chassis, but with a later model body designed for the four-cylinder car.

Ernest Proctor, who was employed at the Westcroft Works, was given the job of assembling this hybrid car, which comprised a very early two-cylinder engine - number 30 - of 1901 or 1902 vintage, a 1904 chassis - number 126, and a body destined for four-cylinder car number 156.

Technical data:
:Engine: No.30. Twin-cylinder horizontal, each cylinder 4&quot; dia. x 6&quot; stroke. Inlet valves suction operated: exhaust valves mechanically operated. Water-cooled, with no pump or cooling fan.
:Ignition: 6 volt battery producing ignition via 2 trembler coils (originally also fitted with magneto with switching between trembler and magneto as required). Conventional spark plugs.
:Lubrication: Drip feed from reservoir on dashboard via sight glasses to 6 oiling points on main bearings and pistons.
:Gearboxes: Two boxes - one for 1st. 3rd. and reverse, the other for 2nd. and 4th. with a sliding shaft between the two. Lubrication by splash feed in each box.
:Transmission: Main drive from engine to gear boxes via heavy steel spur gear into a mating &#x27;Buffoline&#x27; rawhide gear attached to the flywheel on the crank shaft.
:Final Drive: By two chains via a differential.
:Brakes: Foot brake operates on transmission. Hand brake is a conventional drum brake on the rear wheels only.
:Wheels/tires: Originally wooden wheels with solid tires, but these were changed in the early years to Sankey type metal wheels and fitted with balloon tires.
:Lighting: Side and rear lamps - oil (paraffin). Headlamps acetylene - gas produced from carbide/water accumulator.

The car was first registered Y184 and was delivered to Darlington at Kennington Vicarage on 10 March 1906. It was used in London until it was driven to Curry Rivel on 23 April 1906 by Henry Lucas, a James &amp; Browne salesman, who remained with the owner for some time after delivery, to teach him how to drive and maintain the vehicle.

The car was driven by Darlington, accompanied by his eldest son John, in 1913/1914, on a 2,000 mile tour of Europe. At the outbreak of World War I, the car was taken back to Kennington where it remained until about 1925, when John Darlington Jr. &quot;got it going again&quot;, and drove it back to Curry Rivel. By this time Dr. Darlington had purchased an Armstrong, so the James &amp; Browne was stored in a barn. 
When the James &amp; Browne Company ceased trading, Henry Lucas (the salesman and chauffeur) with his colleague and friend Ernest Proctor were both made redundant. Lucas, with a partner John Drake, started a motor business in Egham, Surrey called the Egham Motor Company, and in 1914 asked Proctor to join them as Works Manager.

While on holiday in Somerset in 1938, Lucas called at the house in Curry Rivel to see what had happened to the Darlington family; Dr. Darlington was still there and so was the James &amp; Browne car... in the barn. Dr. Darlington gave the car to Lucas who brought it back to Egham where he and Proctor restored it. It was then kept in the showroom of The Egham Motor Company for many years.

However, when applying to register the car after its restoration, it was discovered that Dr. Darlington had transferred the original registration number, Y184, to his Armstrong, which was (and we believe, still is) on the road! 
Somerset County Council allocated the nearest unused number to the James &amp; Browne ...Y182 - hence the temporary 2 was fixed over the 4 on the original number plates.

After World War II the car was officially dated by the Veteran Car Club as a 1904 model, and Lucas and Proctor entered it in the London to Brighton Run in November 1948 - the first London to Brighton run for the car. Henry Lucas was driving and Ernest Proctor was passenger.

Proctor&#x27;s eldest son, Sidney, joined his father and Henry on many of the early runs, until Ernest died in 1958.
By 1963, Lucas had become too infirm to continue to look after the car and, as he had no children, he sold the car to Sidney Proctor. On Sidney’s death the car passed to his son. The car was in the Proctor family until it was auctioned in November 2007.

<doc id="383012" wikidata="Q213481" url="?curid=383012" title="La Baule-Escoublac">
<text>La Baule-Escoublac (; Gallo: &quot;Écoubiâ&quot;, , ), commonly referred to as La Baule, is a commune in the Loire-Atlantique department, Pays de la Loire, western France.

A century-old seaside resort in southern Brittany with villas, casino, luxury hotels and an original mix of old Breton and seaside culture with a 9 kilometre long sand beach, La Baule has long been home to French high society&#x27;s seaside residences. During July and August each year, the population of La Baule increases dramatically with many Parisians staying for weeks and regular day-trippers from Nantes. Parisians can take the train in Paris Montparnasse Station and it is about 3 hours to go to La Baule. Despite this, La Baule is still virtually unknown outside France.

==History==
In 1779, a violent storm buried the village of Escoublac, near the current location of La Baule, under sand. Escoublac was rebuilt further inland. At that time, the very unstable dunes were occupied only by customs officers, who gave them the name of Bôle, a term indicating an easily flooded maritime meadow.

===Birth of a seaside resort===
It was only in 1879, when the Saint-Nazaire-Croisic railroad was conceived by Parisian industrialist Jules-Joseph Hennecart that the tourist potential of the coast was recognised.

Just before the inauguration of the line, Hennecart bought 40 ha of dunes for the Society of Escoublac Dunes (Société des dunes d&#x27;Escoublac) and commissioned local architect Georges Lafont to design the new town. Lafont designed a long sand promenade named Avenue de la Gare (today Avenue du Général-de-Gaulle) and a chapel (see picture). After the railroad opened Lafont built more than 250 villas, taking the lead in the development of the seaside resort.

===Rise of a seaside resort===
In 1918, casino business magnate François André (see Groupe Lucien Barrière) set up the redesigning of the La Baule resort based on the Deauville model by combining casinos, luxury hotels and sports facilities all on one site.

In the 1920s, Parisian businessman Louis Lajarrige designed the &quot;Bois d&#x27;Amour&quot; district at La Baule-les-Pins and formed an agreement with the railroad company to move the rails away from the seaside to ensure a direct access to the beach. On 27 July 1927 the new stations of &quot;La Baule-les-Pins&quot; and &quot;La Baule-Escoublac&quot; were inaugurated while the old station was torn down to create a flower garden square. By that time, La Baule had become a fashionable seaside resort.

===Poche de Saint-Nazaire===
During World War II, La Baule formed part of the protective stretch of coast leading to the nearby harbour city of Saint-Nazaire, home of one of the biggest U-boat stations that the Germans built. It not only serviced the German submarine fleet, but was also the only dry dock on the Atlantic capable of housing the German battleship Tirpitz, one of two Bismarck-class ships built for the German Kriegsmarine during World War II.

La Baule and the surrounding areas were heavily occupied by the Germans throughout World War II. During the occupation, a large number of Jewish residents and resistance members were deported to the concentration camps; in La Baule itself 32 Jewish men, women and children - the youngest of whom was 3 years old - were deported (with the assistance of the local French police) to Auschwitz where they all perished.

In 2011, a small group of local residents formed a group to create a permanent memorial, in the form of Stolperstein, to the 32 Jewish deportees since, although there was a memorial in La Baule to 40 named war victims, there was no mention there or on any other memorial of the 32 Jewish deportees. The Mayor refused to allow a request for the Stolpersteines to be installed, claiming that to do so might infringe the French constitutional principles of secularism (&quot;&quot;laïcité&quot;) and freedom of opinion (&quot;liberté d&#x27;opinion&quot;&quot;) and that the Mairie would therefore need to consult the Conseil d&#x27;État, France&#x27;s constitutional court. In fact, Stolpersteines contain no reference to the religion of the victim who is commemorated and &#x27;freedom of opinion/expression&#x27; has never been invoked in either French or European jurisprudence to justify the refusal to commemorate individual victims of war crimes. The Mayor of La Baule has consistently refused to elaborate on his reasoning, and there is no record of the Municipal Council of La Baule having sought a declaration from the Conseil d&#x27;Etat in respect of these objections.

Such was the importance attached to the area by the Germans that their troops kept fighting in La Baule and Saint-Nazaire for nine months longer than in the rest of the department, eventually surrendering on 11 May 1945 (3 days after the German unconditional surrender), making this one of the last liberated parts of France. This episode is called &quot;Poche de Saint-Nazaire&quot; from the French expression &quot;poche de resistance&quot;.

==Population==
==Tourism==
One of France&#x27;s most exclusive seaside resorts during the first half of the 20th century, La Baule has become much more democratized since the 1960s. Today the resort mixes wealthy family villas, luxury hotels and seaside apartment buildings. The nearby region has long been an area of contact and conflict between Breton culture and that of the neighbouring Loire Valley, and consequently is rich with historic places, castles (Nantes castle), walled cities (Guerande), not to mention 19th century seaside resorts, such as Quiberon, and many typical Breton fishing villages (Le Croisic, Pornichet).

==Culture==
===La Baule Professional Tennis Championships===
There were several pro tennis tournaments held at La Baule on red clay courts.

Champions:
1964 Luis Alberto Ayala - 
1937 William Tatem (Bill) Tilden II - 
1936 Henri Jean Cochet - 
1935 Henry Ellsworth Vines - 
1928 Martin Plaa

===Grand Prix de la Baule (automobiles)===
The Grand Prix de la Baule was a Grand Prix motor racing event held there during the 1930s.

===Grand Prix de la Baule (equestrian)===
Today, the Grand Prix de la Ville de La Baule is an equestrian jumping competition part of the international Equestrian Nations Cup series.

===Tourism===
Local tourist authorities routinely refer to the bay as &quot;the most beautiful in Europe&quot;. La Baule is part of the Côte d&#x27;Amour.

The commune of Escoublac has achieved a new vitality with the restoration of its civic center and the installation of many attractions.

The Musée Aéronautique Presqu&#x27;île Côte d&#x27;Amour (MAPICA), located at the airport, maintains a collection of restored historical French aircraft in flying condition.

<doc id="383017" wikidata="Q1147692" url="?curid=383017" title="Goregrind">
<text>Goregrind is a fusion genre of grindcore and death metal. British band Carcass are commonly credited for the emergence of the genre. Goregrind is recognized for its heavily edited, pitch shifted vocals and abrasive musicianship rooted in grindcore and its lyrical emphasis on gore, death, pathology, and rape.

==History==
Despite the early impact of albums such as Repulsion&#x27;s &quot;Horrified&quot; and Impetigo&#x27;s &quot;Ultimo Mondo Cannibale&quot;, the origins of the genre really lie with the British band Carcass, who began their career in the late 1980s. In their &quot;Reek of Putrefaction&quot; era, Carcass used pitch shifters, medical imagery and several visceral associations—all of which are tropes that would become synonymous with goregrind.

==Characteristics==
According to Matthew Harvey,
&quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; described goregrind as being defined by &quot;detuned guitars, blasting drums (sometimes with a high-tuned, clanging &#x27;biscuit tin&#x27; snare drum sound), sickening lyrics and often heavily processed/distorted vocals.&quot; Goregrind bands commonly use extremely low or pitch-shifted vocals. Unlike Grindcore, Goregrind will often times have much slower tempos and lower pitched guitars. The lyrics&#x27; subject matter often features violent themes including gore, forensic pathology, death, and rape. Lyrics sometimes have a clear tongue-in-cheek Z-grade horror-movie feel and are not expected to be taken seriously. Cyjan, former drummer for Polish goregrind band Dead Infection, commented, &quot;Musically, there&#x27;s no real difference between grindcore and goregrind, but lyrically, whereas the first is socially and politically concerned, goregrind, as the name implies, deals with everything related to blood, pathological aspects or accidents with fatal results.&quot;

==Offshoot genres==
===Pornogrind===

Pornogrind (also known as porngrind or pornogore) is a microgenre, which is similar and related to goregrind, that deals with sexual and pornographic themes, hence the name. Notable bands include Gut and Cock and Ball Torture.

<text>Francis Hague (January 17, 1876 – January 1, 1956), known as Frank Hague, was an American politician of the Democratic Party who served as mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey, from 1917 to 1947, and vice-chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1924 until 1952. Hague is remembered for running a corrupt political machine that dominated the politics of Hudson County, New Jersey, and of the entire state of New Jersey. During his 30 years as mayor, Hague&#x27;s influence reached the national level. His ability to gain huge majorities in Hudson County for the Democrats helped elect governors and presidents, and his machine dispensed jobs and aid in exchange for votes. Among the projects built under Hague were the Jersey City Medical Center, then the third-largest hospital in the world, and Roosevelt Stadium.

Hague was born in Jersey City, the son of Irish immigrants, and was never educated past the sixth grade. In 1896, he began his political rise with his election as constable for Jersey City&#x27;s Second Ward. In 1913, he became commissioner of public safety as one of five members of the city&#x27;s governing body, and over the next four years did much to clean up Jersey City&#x27;s decrepit police and fire departments. Re-elected in 1917, his fellow commissioners chose him as mayor, a post he would hold for three decades.

Hague quickly became a power in New Jersey, electing three Democratic governors in succession who would have lost if not for Hudson County, and successfully campaigning to defeat a proposal to move the governor&#x27;s election to a presidential year, for all three Republican presidential candidates of the 1920s won New Jersey. This changed in 1932, when, after a shaky start, Hague allied with Franklin D. Roosevelt, staging a huge rally for him. Hudson County outweighed the rest of the state to win New Jersey for Roosevelt, and Roosevelt rewarded Hague by steering federal money through him, greatly increasing his power, and by shielding him from possible prosecution.

By the 1940s, Hague was spending much time vacationing outside the city, which was changing, with other ethnic groups challenging the longtime Irish dominance. He resigned in 1947 in favor of his nephew, Frank Hague Eggers, who was defeated in the 1949 municipal elections. Hague died at his apartment in New York City on January 1, 1956.

==Early life==
Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Hague, born January 17, 1876 in Jersey City, New Jersey, was the fourth of eight children to John D. and Margaret Hague (née Fagen), immigrants from County Cavan, Ireland. Frank Hague was born in a tenement known as &quot;The Ark&quot;–after a rainstorm, it was surrounded by stagnant water. 

John Hague had fled Ireland due to his involvement in a conspiracy against the British, and served as a soldier for the Pope during the Italian War of Independence. He then emigrated to New Jersey, where he served as a blacksmith for the Erie Railroad and later as bank guard, a job gotten for him by the local Democratic Party leader. Margaret Hague ruled the family with an iron hand, and was called by one neighbor, &quot;a bitch on wheels&quot;.

Jersey City then was an important rail terminus and manufacturing center, with close trade ties to nearby New York City, and a destination where many recent immigrants lived. Frank Hague was raised in Jersey City&#x27;s Second Ward, an area known as The Horseshoe due to its shape which wrapped around a railroad loop. In the Horseshoe, money was scarce but saloons plentiful; recreation for the local youths included visiting the wealthier parts of town to battle young &quot;lace curtain&quot; Irish.

Hague was expelled from school for poor attendance and unacceptable behavior before completing the sixth grade at Public School No. 21 in Jersey City. Not yet 14, this completed his formal education. He worked briefly as a blacksmith&#x27;s apprentice for the Erie Railroad, joining his father on the payroll. How it was he left the employment of the railroad is not known. While training at a local gym for his own potential debut as a prizefighter, he arranged to become manager for Joe Craig, a professional lightweight boxer. Craig was successful enough to allow Hague to buy a few suits that made him appear successful. In 1896, Hague&#x27;s apparent prosperity gained him the attention of local tavern owner &quot;Nat&quot; Kenny who was seeking a candidate for constable in the upcoming primary to run against the candidate of a rival tavern owner. Kenny provided Hague with $75 to &quot;spread around&quot;, and Frank Hague, at age 20, won his first election by a ratio of three-to-one.

==Political rise ==

===Early advancement ===

In entering politics in Jersey City, Hague joined a world where massive voter fraud was commonplace, accompanied by violence, though clubs were more often the weapon of choice than firearms. Hague&#x27;s victory in the constable election brought him to the attention of Hudson County Democratic political boss Bob Davis, and Davis asked Hague to help get out Democratic votes for the upcoming 1897 mayoral election. Hague&#x27;s efforts were credited with generating large voter turnout in the Second Ward for the 1897 and 1899 elections. As a reward for his work, Hague was appointed as a deputy sheriff at a salary of $25 per week.

In 1901, Hague became a precinct leader in the Davis organization. In that year&#x27;s mayoral election, Republican Mark M. Fagan was elected to the first of three consecutive two-year terms. Hague&#x27;s Second Ward was one of only two that voted Democratic. Hague survived a Republican challenge for another term as constable the following year. Hague spent much time at City Hall, expanding his political contacts, and occasionally served a summons or took a convict to the state prison at Trenton. In 1903, he married Jenny Warner, also of the Horseshoe; they had two children, a daughter who died in infancy, and a son, Frank Hague Jr., who would become a judge of New Jersey&#x27;s highest court. They also adopted a daughter, Margaret.

As a ward leader, Hague was approached by a woman to aid her son. The son, Red Dugan, had been a classmate of Hague&#x27;s, and had been arrested in Massachusetts for forging a check. Hague ignored a subpoena to testify in Hudson County court and provided an alibi for Dugan. Hague and another deputy sheriff, Thomas &quot;Skidder&quot; Madigan, claimed that they had seen Dugan in Jersey City on the day of the offense, but their testimony conflicted with Dugan&#x27;s confession. Both were threatened with perjury charges. Upon returning to Jersey City, Hague was found guilty of contempt of court for ignoring the subpoena. He was fined $100 and stripped of his office as deputy sheriff, but his willingness to help a friend endeared him to the residents of the Second Ward.

Hague rose through the Democratic machine of Hudson County, which drew much of its strength by providing newly arrived immigrants with rudimentary social services. Hague took a job as a bill collector for a local brewery, leaving him with time to spend in the streets and the local taverns which were hubs of political activity. By 1906, Hague had become prominent enough that he could ask a job of Davis; he was given the position of sergeant at arms for the New Jersey General Assembly–the lower house of the legislature had just been captured by the Democrats, and in the division of the political spoils, the position of sergeant at arms fell to Hudson County. Davis also named Hague to the Democratic executive committee for Hudson County.

===City official===
Hague broke ties with &quot;Boss&quot; Davis in 1906 over a difference of opinion on a candidate for appointment to the city Street and Water Board. As a result, Hague supported H. Otto Wittpenn for mayor in the 1907 election. Wittpenn was a reformer who opposed the control Davis held over Hudson County politics. Nevertheless, he made a deal with Davis to gain election over Fagan in 1907. Over the objections of Davis, newly elected Mayor Wittpenn appointed Hague as chief custodian of City Hall – an easy job with plenty of patronage opportunities. Davis tried to deprive Hague of the office, but Hague outmaneuvered him.

Hague also became friendly with Wittpenn&#x27;s secretary – a Presbyterian Sunday school teacher named A. Harry Moore. Probably the first Protestant Hague knew personally, Moore would be presented by Hague to the Irish Catholics of Jersey City in future elections as a WASP trustworthy because Hague controlled him. Moore would serve three terms as governor of New Jersey. Another lasting alliance Hague made was with John Milton, a young lawyer who would advise him in the decades to come. and who would become a United States senator.

In 1909 Davis supported Wittpenn&#x27;s re-election against former mayor Fagan. Hague&#x27;s Second Ward produced the largest plurality of Wittpenn votes of any of Jersey City&#x27;s 12 wards. Wittpenn in 1910 sought the Democratic nomination for governor, with Hague&#x27;s support. Davis worked to defeat him, and the nomination went to the president of Princeton University, Woodrow Wilson. The nominee requested that Wittpenn withdraw a rival slate to Davis&#x27;s in Jersey City to ensure party unity; Wittpenn agreed over Hague&#x27;s objection, who kept the slate in the Second Ward from withdrawing. Hague&#x27;s candidates were defeated, and the incident could have ruined Hague&#x27;s political career, but by then Wittpenn and Hague had learned of Davis&#x27;s maneuvering to defeat the mayor&#x27;s candidacy, and allied against Davis. Hague and Wittpenn were able to claim credit for Wilson&#x27;s victory, and Davis died in early 1911.

Davis&#x27;s death contributed to Hague&#x27;s rise, since Wittpenn, who desired to succeed Wilson as governor, did not control Democratic politics in Hudson County as thoroughly as Davis had. Hague in 1911 was elected street and water commissioner. The new position greatly expanded Hague&#x27;s patronage powers. While City Hall employed a few dozen custodians, there were hundreds of workers in the Street and Water Department.

One of the greatest boosts to Hague&#x27;s rise to power was the Walsh Act of 1911. This legislation, backed by Governor Wilson, allowed municipalities to adopt a nonpartisan commission form of government, with each commissioner assigned specific responsibilities. Jersey City adopted it, with the first elections held in 1913. Originally, Hague opposed commission government, but saw that it would be easier to control a five-member commission than a large city council, and was a candidate, presenting himself as a reformer who was sacrificing two years of his elected term as street commissioner to serve on the new body. He broke with Wittpenn, who was again seeking election as governor following Wilson&#x27;s elevation to the presidency, backing James Fielder, who defeated Wittpenn for the nomination. Hague&#x27;s work as head of the Department of Street Cleaners even convinced &quot;The Jersey Journal&quot; to endorse him as a reform candidate. 

Under the Walsh Act as adopted in Jersey City, power would mean controlling at least three of the five commissionerships. Hague and Moore allied with former mayor Fagan to form a slate prior to the June 10, 1913 election. Although two Wittpenn men were also chosen, Hague, a member of Jersey City&#x27;s largest ethnic bloc, Irish Catholics, was seen as a voice of change in a city long dominated by Protestants of the Republican Party. Fagan, Moore and Hague were all elected commissioners, with Fagan made mayor and Hague commissioner of public safety.

===Commissioner===
Jersey City police, to that point, had only been slightly less frightening to the residents than were the criminals. Hague immediately set about reshaping the corrupt police force with tough Horseshoe recruits. Although the commissioner of public safety originally did not have the power to try and dismiss police officers, Milton authored an amendment to the Walsh Act that conferred this power, and Hague used it to fire hundreds of officers and dissolve their unions. Hague spearheaded crackdowns on prostitution and narcotics trafficking, earning him favor with religious leaders. These enforcement acts went as far as Hague himself marching across local vaudeville stages personally directing the shut down of &quot;girlie shows.&quot; Nevertheless, he turned a blind eye to Jersey City&#x27;s well-patronized gambling parlors. At the heart of this change was an inner cadre of officers known as the Zeppelin Squad or &quot;zepps&quot; who were loyal to Hague alone. The &quot;zepps&quot; would spy on, and report back to Hague about other members of the department. Eventually, Jersey City had one patrolman for every 3,000 residents, causing a marked decline in the city&#x27;s once-astronomical crime rate. 

Hague took steps to curb the police department&#x27;s lackadaisical work ethic, punishing offenses that had been ignored for years. He also made much-needed improvements to the fire department; at the time he took office Jersey City&#x27;s fire insurance rates were among the highest in the nation. Commissioner Hague led high-profile campaigns against threats to public safety, which had the effect of promoting him as someone who knew how to get things done. He kept his immigrant base onside by ignoring violations of the blue laws by saloons.

Upon discovering in early 1916 that millions of pounds of munitions were being stockpiled on the Jersey City waterfront prior to their shipment to the Allies of World War I, Hague travelled to Washington, D.C. to register concerns for the safety of his constituents. His meetings with congressmen resulted in no action. Hague&#x27;s concerns were shown to be valid in July 1916 when the Black Tom explosion caused $20 million in damage, including to the nearby Statue of Liberty.

Hague&#x27;s influence grew, and he was able to undermine Wittpenn&#x27;s 1916 campaign for governor. While the evidence is scant, Hague is believed to have made a deal with Republican candidate Walter Edge&#x27;s campaign manager, the Republican boss of Atlantic City, Nucky Johnson. Instead of receiving a 20,000-plus vote margin in Hudson County as had the past two Democratic candidates, including Wilson, Wittpenn, who lived in Hudson County, won there by only 7,400 votes and was defeated statewide. According to author and judge Nelson Johnson, &quot;From then on, Otto Wittpenn and the progressive wing of the Democratic Party were no longer a factor in Frank Hague’s political calculations.&quot;

Hague gained popularity with a well-publicized incident where he led a posse to Newark and captured Michael Rombolo, who had killed Frank Kenny, son of saloon owner Ned Kenny. Hague himself took down the armed killer, who was returned to Jersey City in Hague&#x27;s car amid a parade of honking vehicles crossing the Hackensack River from Newark.

In 1917, Hague, with his reputation as the man who cleaned up the police force, ran for reelection. He put together a commission ticket called &quot;The Unbossed.&quot; The ticket consisted of him, Parks Commissioner Moore, Revenue Commissioner George Brensinger, ex-judge Charles F.X. O&#x27;Brien and City Clerk Michael I. Fagan. Wittpenn and Mark Fagan begged President Wilson for help against Hague, but according to Thomas Fleming in his history of the state, &quot;Wilson was too absorbed with saving the world to pay any more attention to New Jersey.&quot; Hague&#x27;s ticket swept all five spots on the commission. Moore topped the poll, and traditional practice called for him to be appointed mayor. However, when the commission met for the first time on May 11, Hague was chosen as the new mayor. He would remain a power in Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey and the nation for the next thirty years. Wrote historian Steven Hart, &quot;The city election of 1917 would later be seen as the death of the Progressive movement in New Jersey, though few realized it at the time since talk of reform was still thick in the air.&quot;

==Mayor==

Technically, Hague&#x27;s only responsibility as mayor was to appoint the school board. Otherwise, he was merely first among equals, with no powers over and above the other four commissioners. However, soon after taking office, he wrested control of the Hudson County Democratic Party from Wittpenn. His role allowed him to gain wealth well beyond his salary as mayor, which never exceeded $7,500, with a fourteen-room duplex in Jersey City&#x27;s finest apartment building, a mansion on the Jersey Shore, and a rented villa in Florida every winter.

=== Rising figure ===
After his election as mayor, Hague quickly sought to increase taxes on the railroads and utility companies who occupied much of Jersey City&#x27;s land but paid minimal property taxes. The taxes were passed but were soon reversed by the statewide tax board in Trenton. Hague realized that he needed not only to control Hudson County, but the entire state of New Jersey, and sought a pliable candidate for governor for the next election, in 1919. He decided on Hudson County&#x27;s state senator, Edward I. Edwards, who was best known for his service as state comptroller, during which he had docked Wilson&#x27;s pay for the time he spent running for president. Opponents had trouble finding anyone willing to oppose Edwards for the nomination, and eventually, Essex County&#x27;s Democratic boss, Jim Nugent ran. Edwards won the primary election by a large margin, and at Hague&#x27;s urging, ran on the issue of Prohibition, which Hague believed unpopular in the state, with Edwards pledging to make New Jersey &quot;wetter than the Atlantic Ocean&quot;. With 20 of New Jersey&#x27;s 21 counties reporting, the Republican, Newton Bugbee, had a 21,000 vote lead, a lead swamped by the 36,000 vote margin posted for Edwards in Hudson County. As one of his first acts, Edwards fired the entire tax assessments board; the new board approved Hague&#x27;s taxes on the railroads and utilities. In part due to increased taxes on non-local corporations such as railroads, by 1930, Jersey City had the highest municipal tax rate in the nation. Through Edwards, Hague was able to select Hudson County&#x27;s judges and prosecutors, making himself immune from investigation.

The revenue from the new taxes allowed Hague to hire his supporters and provide social service programs to the electorate. Hague proclaimed himself leader of the New Jersey Democratic Party, and Edwards allowed him to recommend dozens of appointments to high state offices. Democrats won five out of eight gubernatorial races between 1919 and 1940, more often than not due to massive landslides in Hudson County. However, he was never able to extend his dominance to the state legislature, which remained Republican in most years.

By the 1921 municipal elections, most of Hague&#x27;s local rivals had left the scene either through death or departure from Jersey City. The major opposition in that year was from the Republicans, running on a fusion ticket with dissident Democrats. Hague easily triumphed. His tight control of the Hudson County Democratic Party, together with the reluctant of high-profile nonpartisan individuals to oppose him, meant that a weak Hudson County Republican Party provided the opposition to Hague through much of the remainder of his time as mayor. With Edwards ineligible to run for a second consecutive term under the New Jersey Constitution, Hague needed a new candidate, and found one in Judge George Silzer of Middlesex County. In the 1922 gubernatorial election, Hudson County again erased a Republican lead to elect the Democrat, while Edwards moved to the U.S. Senate by beating incumbent Republican Joseph S. Frelinghuysen.

Republicans presented evidence to the county prosecutor of individuals voting multiple times, and dead people recorded as casting a ballot. They showed that Republicans had voted in precincts where the Republican vote was recorded as zero. The county prosecutor was Milton, and no one was charged.

=== Boss of New Jersey ===
Hague supported the state&#x27;s ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing women the vote, leading to New Jersey becoming the 29th state to ratify the amendment in 1920. Thereafter, Hague made sure that his slate of candidates for the legislature always included a woman, beginning with Irene Brown, one of the first women to serve in the state legislature in the United States. Brown was followed by May Carty and Catherine Finn. He furthered the career of Mary Norton, who had been a social worker who approached Hague for funds for a day care center, and went on to serve on the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders before being elected, in 1924, to the first of thirteen terms in the federal House of Representatives, representing New Jersey&#x27;s 12th congressional district (at that time, Jersey City and Bayonne). Though not the first woman to serve in Congress, at the time of her swearing-in in 1925, she was the only one. She would go on to chair congressional committees and play a significant role in the passage of the New Deal.
In 1925, Moore became the third consecutive Democratic governor elected with Hague&#x27;s help. Moore was more able to cooperate with the Republican legislature than his two predecessors, leading to state jobs for Hague&#x27;s followers. Through this series of governors, Hague was able to consolidate his rule through control of the civil service, taxing authority and patronage. In 1927, the Republicans, tired of losing off-year elections, proposed a state constitutional amendment to increase the governor&#x27;s term from three to four years, and move that election to the presidential election year. Hague led the opposition to the proposal, which was defeated thanks to a huge number of votes against from Hudson County. To defeat a critic, Robert Carey, who sought the Republican nomination in 1928, and who Hague believed would be harder to beat, Hague got 20,000 Democrats who had not voted in the previous year&#x27;s primary to vote for Morgan F. Larson in the Republican primary. State law at the time allowed those who had not voted in the previous year&#x27;s primary election to vote in any party primary without penalty. Hague&#x27;s string of victories in gubernatorial elections ended, though, as Larson was elected.

By 1930, Hague controlled 5,600 city positions and 1,700 Hudson County jobs. Following his success in the 1933 municipal elections, the Republican county supervisor of elections alleged massive fraud and demanded access to the ballot boxes. He was blocked by an injunction issued by Judge Thomas J. Brogan, former Jersey City corporation counsel, who ruled that the supervisor had no power to inspect the boxes even though no votes had been recorded for the opposition in one district. Several affidavits had been filed by voters saying they had voted for opposition candidates in that district. The new county prosecutor, appointed by Governor Larson, a Republican, attempted to bring charges, but there was conflict with the grand jury which lasted until the prosecutor&#x27;s term expired in 1934 and he was replaced by Governor Moore (then serving his second term) with a Hague adherent. In a similar case in 1937, Brogan ruled that though the boxes could be opened, no one had the right to look inside, therefore it was pointless to open the boxes.

=== National figure ===
Hague met the governor of New York, Al Smith, at the 1920 Democratic National Convention. The two quickly formed a close friendship, bonded by similar slum upbringings as Irish-American Catholics at a time when there was much prejudice towards them. In addition to their personal friendship (the Hagues and Smiths often vacationed together), Hague backed Smith for president at the 1924 Democratic National Convention, switching to him after initially backing New Jersey&#x27;s favorite son, Governor Silzer, but after 103 ballots, the nomination went to former West Virginia representative John W. Davis. Although his candidate was not nominated, the convention made Hague a national figure as he was elected vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Nevertheless, Hague could not deliver New Jersey for Davis, as Calvin Coolidge won the state by over 378,000 votes. Smith was nominated by the Democrats in 1928 for president, but did not win nor take New Jersey—Hague characterized investigations into him that year as an attempt to prevent Smith from winning the state.

In 1932, Hague backed Smith against Franklin D. Roosevelt during the race for the Democratic nomination. At the convention Hague alleged that Roosevelt could not win the election and would lose every state east of the Mississippi. Nevertheless, Roosevelt was nominated, and Hague acted quickly to preserve his influence and power in the party. He telephoned Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign manager, James A. Farley, and offered the New Jersey governor&#x27;s summer residence in Sea Girt for Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign kickoff. Farley accepted, and on August 27, 1932, Hague arranged for a crowd of over 100,000 people, many brought by train, to greet Roosevelt. The nominee stated, &quot;There is no general who could have assembled such a host as my old friend, the mayor of Jersey City&quot;, words that were taken as forgiveness of Hague. In November, Roosevelt won the presidency and became the first Democratic candidate since Wilson to win New Jersey, by 31,000 votes, aided by 118,000 votes from Hudson County.
Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal program resulted in massive federal payments to the states. In most states, these payments went through the governor (especially if a Democrat) but in New Jersey, they went through Hague, allowing him to control employment on a large scale. Hague had some years previously opened the Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital; this was greatly added to, becoming the Jersey City Medical Center, which was dedicated by Hague and Roosevelt on October 2, 1936. This at the time was the third largest hospital in the world, and services were provided, for the most part, for free. These funds would also build Jersey City&#x27;s Roosevelt Stadium, where in 1946, Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Organized Baseball.

Roosevelt, a close political ally, was an active protector of Hague. In 1938, for example, Farley, the postmaster general, reported to the president that a Jersey City machine functionary was reading the mail of one of Hague&#x27;s political enemies. Emphasizing that he had hard evidence, Farley proposed prosecuting Hague for both mail tampering and tax evasion. Roosevelt vetoed the idea responding to Farley: “Forget prosecution. You go tell Frank to knock it off. … But keep this quiet. We need Hague’s support and we want New Jersey.”

===Decline and retirement===
Hague disliked the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO), in part because he deemed it communistic, and in part because he wanted to give Jersey City a pro-business image. He also viewed it as a threat to his control of the state Democratic Party. In 1937, he decided to ban CIO organizers from the city. Those that defied the ban were beaten and jailed, or deported to New York City. Periodicals that reported on this could not be sold in Jersey City. The city refused all permits for CIO rallies, and no private hall in the city would rent to it. The organization sued, and in 1939, the Supreme Court, in the case of &quot;Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization&quot;, ruled against him. According to Fishman, &quot;a landmark ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court was required to extend the First Amendment to Jersey City&quot;.

Already damaged because of his anti-union activities, Hague&#x27;s reputation took another blow in 1940, with the publication of David Dayton McKean&#x27;s book, &quot;The Boss: The Hague Machine in Action&quot;. Although there had been exposes of Hague before, they did little damage and he rather enjoyed the notoriety. McKean&#x27;s book, prepared with the secret assistance of a Hague enemy, lawyer and future Chief Justice of New Jersey Arthur T. Vanderbilt, was widely reviewed and read. Vanderbilt&#x27;s goal was to taint Hague in the eyes of Democratic leaders, and according to Johnson, he was successful.

Also in 1940, an anti-Hague Democrat, Charles Edison, was elected as New Jersey&#x27;s governor. Edison, son of the inventor, had served as Secretary of the Navy in Roosevelt&#x27;s cabinet, and Roosevelt wanted to replace him. Hague reluctantly agreed to support Edison, and Hudson County turned out in its usual numbers to elect him. Once elected, Edison lost no time in breaking with Hague—one story is that his first act on reaching the governor&#x27;s office was to rip out the direct line from Hague. Roosevelt took a nuanced stance between them, knowing Hague was likely to be in office once Edison had left his, and he needed Hudson County to win New Jersey.

In 1943, former governor Walter Edge was returned to office. Edge&#x27;s attorney general, Walter Van Riper, initiated several investigations of Hague&#x27;s activities, and tried to diminish Hague&#x27;s control of law enforcement in Hudson County. Within months, though, a federal grand jury indicted Van Riper, though he was acquitted. According to Vernon, the files indicate that Roosevelt played a part in getting charges brought against Van Riper, which ensured there would be no case against Hague.

Hague&#x27;s machine continued to weaken as World War II ended. The Irish were increasingly becoming a minority in Jersey City as other groups moved in, and with a greater governmental safety net including Social Security, the citizens were less dependent on Hague&#x27;s largesse. The mayor preferred to give major patronage positions to fellow Irish, causing resentment in other groups. Hague was increasingly absent from Jersey City as he aged, spending time on the Jersey Shore and in Florida. Although the opposition doubled its previous showing, Hague&#x27;s ticket still dominated the 1945 municipal elections, winning by 50,000 votes.

Edge was hostile to Hague in his second term as governor; his successor, Alfred Driscoll, wooed Hague to achieve the constitutional reform in New Jersey that Hague had long torpedoed, granting him some state-appointed positions. Hague dropped his opposition to the new constitution, which easily passed in 1947. There were signs that Hague&#x27;s time had passed; the machine in the neighboring city of Hoboken was defeated by a ticket of three Italian-Americans and two Irish.

Hague abruptly announced his retirement on June 4, 1947. However, he was able to have his nephew, Frank Hague Eggers, chosen as his successor. It was generally understood that Hague still held the real power, and he remained deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee. Despite leaving office, Hague generated a huge majority in Hudson County for President Harry Truman in the 1948 presidential election, though it was not enough to win the state. Hague&#x27;s power in Jersey City ended in 1949 when John V. Kenny, a former Hague ward leader alienated by the appointment of Eggers, put together his own commission ticket, and included a Polish-American and an Italian-American. Kenny&#x27;s ticket was able to oust the Hague/Eggers ticket from power. Kenny proved unable to successfully deal with the departure of the middle class for suburban homes, and Jersey City became largely impoverished.

==Death==
Even after the election of Kenny, Hague remained in control of the county and state Democratic organizations, but his loss of power was shown when he could not carry the state or even Hudson County for the Democrat, Elmer Wene, in the 1949 gubernatorial election, as Driscoll won re-election.

Hague spent his final years in exile from Jersey City, fearing subpoenas. He divided his time between a luxurious apartment in New York City and a mansion on Biscayne Bay in Florida. The last vestige of his power fell in 1952, when he was replaced as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, and as committee member from New Jersey. Hague died on January 1, 1956, at his duplex apartment in Manhattan, New York City. His body was taken to Jersey City for the funeral. While hundreds gathered to see the casket depart Quinn&#x27;s funeral home on Academy Street in Jersey City, only four men were seen to remove their hats for the passing of the coffin. One woman present held an American flag and a sign that read: &quot;God have mercy on his sinful, greedy soul.&quot; Hague was laid to rest in a large mausoleum at Holy Name Cemetery in Jersey City.

== Techniques ==

Prior to each primary or general election, Hague would meet with hundreds of members of his organization and urge them to get out the vote. They responded: in a typical Hudson County election under Hague, 92 percent of eligible voters were registered and there was an 85 percent turnout, often making the difference for Democratic candidates between victory statewide and defeat. Hudson County had the most registered voters in the state in 1927, despite being second in population to Essex County per the 1920 census. Dayton David McKean, who wrote a well-researched book hostile to Hague in 1940, deemed Hague&#x27;s ability to get out almost as many votes to defeat the 1927 constitutional amendment referendum as in a gubernatorial election as &quot;almost miraculous ...[it] surpasses comparison, almost belief&quot;.

Hague went beyond the standard of many political bosses who were shadowy figures behind the scenes, for he was on the ballot every four years. In a time when there was only a limited social safety net, he provided jobs for his supporters in exchange for votes, acting through his network of neighborhood leaders, male and female, Despite frequent stories of electoral fraud, he perfected techniques of canvassing, getting his base of working class voters, who held Hague in high esteem, to the polls. Amid the Depression, he delivered food to the doors of the poor and the Jersey City Medical Center provided free health care. The streets were clean and free of crime.

Those wanting to work for Jersey City or Hudson County were expected to repay the favor of their hiring with loyalty, votes, and three percent of their salary to Hague&#x27;s machine. Suppliers and contractors were expected to kick back ten percent of the value of the contract, and the rackets, such as bookmakers, protected by the Hague organization were also expected to pay. Although a Democrat, Hague had no compunction about making deals with Republicans in the state senate or the governor&#x27;s mansion to maintain his power.

Hague fostered good relations with various organizations in Jersey City, seeking to make them if not appendages of his own organization, then at least places where dissent could not grow. Principal among these was the Catholic Church, which had 75 percent of the church membership in Jersey City. Political action by clerics was discouraged, and the tendency of the church in Jersey City to divide among parish lines was encouraged. Some assistance was direct–in 1918, Hudson County legislators obtained legislation allowing police and fire precincts to hire chaplains, and this was widely-used in Jersey City. In fact, the county mechanics bureau had three chaplains, one Catholic, one Protestant, and a rabbi. After a snowstorm, city employees cleared the snow from Catholic schools without any issue of church-state separation being raised. Protestant clergy were frequent critics of Hague in the 1920s, but his anti-Communist crusade in the 1930s and his tight control of saloons following Prohibition muted that criticism. Hague always included at least one Protestant on his ticket for the city commission.

==Legacy and historical view==

Hague served an unequaled 30 years as mayor of Jersey City, seven full terms and part of an eight. His time as mayor, known as the &quot;Hague Era&quot;, is associated with bossism. Hague has often been described as corrupt, something Leonard Vernon, who wrote a 2011 biography of Hague, believed unfair and derived from McKean&#x27;s earlier book on Hague. Vernon cited as an example Hague&#x27;s characterization in the HBO series &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, about 1930s Atlantic City and its Republican boss, Nucky Johnson, in which Hague is seen with a glass in his hand and a woman on his lap, something uncharacteristic of Hague, a lifelong teetotaler about whom there was no hint of extramarital scandal. Vernon believed that McKean&#x27;s book has done more damage to Hague&#x27;s reputation than any other work. Nelson Johnson agreed, &quot;No one did more to sully Frank Hague’s name in American history than David Dayton McKean. Thanks to McKean’s book, Hague’s image in twentieth-century urban history is beyond rehabilitation.&quot; 

According to Hart, &quot;In terms of power and longevity, only Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley rates as Hague’s peer as a political boss.&quot; McKean, writing in 1940, stated, &quot;Even Tammany Hall, the prototype of all machine politics, never dominated New York as Hague and his political associates have dominated Jersey City and Hudson County. Richard J. Connors, in his book on Hague&#x27;s years in power, believed that Hague fell because he would not put in the same amount of work to keep power as he had to gain it, &quot;The Boss game has its rules. Frank Hague violated too many of them.&quot;

Vernon believed the negative portrayal of Hague by historians to be unjust, or at least incomplete, &quot;History, legend and lore has firmly planted Frank Hague&#x27;s career in the spectrum of morally gray, and there is no doubt that the placement is an accurate one. But if one is to delve further into this often-used analogy, one must first concede that gray is not a true color, but rather a blend of black and white. The reviewers of Hague&#x27;s clearly ambiguous legacy have chosen to separate out the two elements and concentrate entirely on the black.&quot; A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Hague as the second-worst American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993. According to historian Robert Fishman in the &quot;American National Biography&quot; entry on Hague:

==Quotes==
&quot;We hear about constitutional rights, free speech and the free press. Every time I hear those words I say to myself, &#x27;That man is a Red, that man is a Communist.&#x27; You never heard a real American talk in that manner.&quot; – speech to the Jersey City Chamber of Commerce, January 12, 1938.

&quot;Listen, here is the law! I am the law! These boys go to work!&quot; – speech on city government to the Emory Methodist Episcopal Church in Jersey City, November 10, 1937.

<text>The Pleasure of the Text () is a 1973 book by the French literary theorist Roland Barthes.

==Summary==
Barthes sets out some of his ideas about literary theory. He divides the effects of texts into two: (&#x27;pleasure&#x27;) and , translated as &#x27;bliss&#x27; but the French word also carries the meaning of &#x27;orgasm&#x27;.

The distinction corresponds to a further distinction Barthes makes between and , translated respectively as &#x27;readerly&#x27; and &#x27;writerly&#x27; texts (a more literal translation would be &#x27;readable&#x27; and &#x27;writable&#x27;). is a neologism in French. The pleasure of the text corresponds to the readerly text, which does not challenge the reader&#x27;s position as a subject. The writerly text provides bliss, which explodes literary codes and allows the reader to break out of his or her subject position.

The &quot;readerly&quot; and the &quot;writerly&quot; texts were identified and explained in Barthes&#x27;s &quot;S/Z&quot;. Barthes argues that &quot;writerly&quot; texts are more important than &quot;readerly&quot; ones because he sees the text&#x27;s unity as forever being re-established by its composition, the codes that form and constantly slide around within the text. The reader of a readerly text is largely passive, whereas the person who engages with a writerly text has to make an active effort, and even to re-enact the actions of the writer himself. The different codes (hermeneutic, action, symbolic, semic, and historical) that Barthes defines in &quot;S/Z&quot; inform and reinforce one another, making for an open text that is indeterminant precisely because it can always be written anew.

As a consequence, although one may experience pleasure in the readerly text, it is when one sees the text from the writerly point of view that the experience is blissful.

==Influences==
Few writers in cultural studies and the social sciences have used and developed the distinctions that Barthes makes. The British sociologist of education Stephen Ball has argued that the National Curriculum in England and Wales is a writerly text, by which he means that schools, teachers and pupils have a certain amount of scope to reinterpret and develop it. On the other hand, artist Roy Ascott&#x27;s pioneering telematic artwork, (&#x27;The Pleating of the Texte&#x27;, 1983) drew inspiration from Barthes&#x27;s . Ascott modified the title to emphasize the pleasure of collective textual pleating. In Ascott&#x27;s artwork, the pleating of the text resulted from a process that the artist calls &quot;distributed authorship&quot;, which expands Barthes&#x27; concept of the &quot;readerly text&quot;. In Ascott&#x27;s work, the text itself is the result of a collaborative reading/writing process among participants around the world, connected via computer networking (telematics). Ascott&#x27;s work thus unravels the distinction between readers and writers, demonstrating a much greater degree of permeability than Barthes&#x27;s distinction permits (and beyond Barthes&#x27;s theory of the death of the author). Moreover, the mechanism of distributed authorship enabled Ascott&#x27;s &quot;planetary fairytale&quot; to self-pleat in a way that, like a surrealist exquisite corpse, could not have been the product of a single mind. Rather, Ascott suggests, the work emerged as the result of an emergent field of collective intelligence that joined minds together in a global field of consciousness.

<text>A Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) was a unit introduced by the United States government, consisting of military officers, diplomats, and reconstruction subject matter experts, working to support reconstruction efforts in unstable states. PRTs were first established in Afghanistan in early 2002, and were used in Iraq as well. While the concepts are similar, PRTs in Afghanistan and Iraq had separate compositions and missions. Their common purpose, however, was to empower local governments to govern their constituents more effectively.

==Structure==
A PRT included a military component (Civil Affairs/Force Protection, etc.), civilian police advisors, and civilian representatives of US (or other national) government foreign affairs agencies. In a US-led PRT, this generally included a representative from USAID, the Department of State, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Justice. They were assisted by public diplomacy and reporting staff. The PRTs were the primary civil-military relations tool in Afghanistan and Iraq and have been described as &quot;&#x27;a means to extend the reach and enhance the legitimacy of the central government&#x27;&quot; into the provinces of Afghanistan.

A PRT in Afghanistan was commanded by a military officer, generally of the rank of Lieutenant Colonel (USAF) or Commander (USN). The officer was supported by a team of various specialties including civil affairs, engineers, medical staff, public affairs, information operations, logistics and a platoon of National Guard soldiers for security. The staff generally numbered between sixty and one hundred persons and trained together as a unit prior to deployment. There was no lead agency or department; the US government civilians and the military commander form an executive committee of equals which developed a strategy for the PRT, drawing on the expertise of all contributing agencies. By 2009, the military still dominated the role within PRTs as only three to four civilians were posted to each team of eighty to two hundred and fifty personnel. The lack of civilian personnel civilian executive agencies was a serious concern of CENTCOM commanders. Activities in Afghanistan focused on extending the reach of the central government into the provinces.

In an Iraq PRT, the Team Leader was a civilian who reports to the US Department of State; the deputy team leader was generally a military officer. While civil affairs members were present on the team, there were more civilians than military personnel on the team. Functional areas included rule of law, reconstruction and development, agriculture, and governance. Some Iraq PRTs were embedded into the Brigade Combat Team (BCT) with which they were colocated (ePRT). The BCT retained responsibility for providing security for the civilian team members. While PRTs in Afghanistan focused on short-term effects and ensuring an attractive alternative to the insurgency was available, Iraq PRTs focused on building the governance capacity at the local levels of government.

===Public Diplomacy===

Public diplomacy was an essential element to successful Provincial Reconstruction Team projects. PRTs, in Afghanistan, were tasked with a specific area of a province and coordinate, develop, and fund local projects with the aid of the government. These projects enabled the local population to become familiar with and trust the U.S. counterinsurgency (COIN) efforts in Afghanistan. Projects supported by PRTs were created and approved by the ranks of the entire provincial government in Afghanistan. The ability of PRTS to conduct Public diplomacy and their ability to work with the provincial government made counterinsurgency objectives obtainable.

The PRT&#x27;s civil affairs line of operation exerted a large amount of public diplomacy. CA operations were responsible, along with the provincial government, for implementation and supervision of projects in the province. These projects included public affairs like humanitarian supply distribution, like school and medical supplies. Civil affairs operations were responsible for reaching out to the population to determine what was deemed necessary to make society stable and secure from the insurgent ideology. To do this, military personnel had to familiarize themselves with the environment, including the people, places, and culture of their section of the province.

In addition to the military cooperation with the provincial government, civilian agencies like the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Agency for International Development, had a strong hand in the projects structured by the PRTs. For example, these agencies worked together to improve farming techniques and introduce ways to bring goods to local markets to meet the increasing demand rather than taking them into Pakistan. PRTs&#x27; interaction with the Afghan people enhanced U.S. public relations and allow the civilians of Afghanistan to trust the American presence in their domain. It was speculated that the only way that the counterinsurgency in Afghanistan could achieve victory is through long-term patience and keeping the people&#x27;s political will through the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in the U.S. military.

Information operations associated with PRTs were also a vital aspect to conducting public diplomacy in order to defeat insurgencies. These operations can include psychological operations, operational security, and military deception operations to deceive enemy combatants. Information operations assisted civil affairs, medical outreach, and agricultural projects by providing information to the local Afghans about counterinsurgency projects and illustrating beneficial effects of them to the community. These operations, as a part of PRTs, enabled the civilians to see how the U.S. military-civilian efforts work secure their society and defeat the insurgents influence. Information operations must be consistent between civilian and military operations.

The goal of the PRTs was to &quot;enhance their popular legitimacy of the provincial government by developing their capacity to conduct reconstruction and provide effective governance.&quot; In order to support the counterinsurgency efforts PRTs built government legitimacy by reconstruction and development to separate the insurgents from the people and to instill trust in U.S. COIN operations.

==Funding==

The main funding for Afghan PRTs came from Provincial Reconstruction and Development Committee (PRDC) and Quick Response Fund (QRF) programs under the International Security Assistance Force. Also, some funding came from USAID; namely under the Community Stabilization Program (CSP); the Local Governance Program (LGP); Community Action Program (CAP); Izdihar Economic Growth Program; and the INMA Agri-business Program.

Additional sources were: the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF), the Commander&#x27;s Emergency Response Program (CERP) was the main fund used by the United States Army or USMC Civil Affairs Teams in both Iraq and Afghanistan. By the new regulations that came out in early 2009, the Iraqi Government has to pay half (50%) of projects above $750,000.

CERP Officers had authority to sign agreements with contractors up to $200,000. The Pay Agent disbursed cash or paid by electronic transfer (EFT) in Afghanistan. The PRT Commander (LTC or CDR) could approve projects up to $25,000. CERP guidelines required that development projects be coordinated through and sustained by local governments and prohibit the use of funding for the salaries of government officials. The monies could not be used by police or security forces. CERP projects from up to $200,000 had to be approved by the Task Force Commander. The contracts were written in US Engineering standards. The Army usually paid by electronic funds transfer as pay agents are discouraged from paying cash to contractors in Afghanistan. The projects were paid in phases. Engineers worked through project details with contractors. If the contractors failed the performance work standard, the engineer could recommend that the PRT withhold funds until project deficiencies were corrected. The project could also be cancelled.

One of the issues that held up a project was sustainability. If the project was not self-sustaining, such as an electric utility in a small village or town, it would not be approved by higher headquarters. Mandated &#x27;Terms of Use&#x27; contracts were signed by the end user of the projects to insure PRTs were providing a self-sufficient resource and would not be responsible for its upkeep. One year guarantee on contractor workmanship was standard.

Other funds that were not used by the Civil Affairs Section: the Development Fund for Iraq. (DFI) and funding targeted specifically for USAID Focused Stabilization, Community Action and Local Governance Program (LGP) as well as PRT development funding.

==Concept and history==
The overall PRT concept in Afghanistan was to use relatively small joint civil-military units to achieve three objectives. PRT objectives were to improve security, to extend the authority of the Afghan central government, and finally to facilitate reconstruction.

The first PRT was located in Gardez in Paktia Province, co-located with US Special Forces &quot;A&quot; team members. A Civil Affairs team provided the daily contact with locals and tribal leaders. A contingent of the 2nd Battalion, 504th Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division provided security in and around the compound. The sole civilian when the PRT became fully operational on February 1, 2003, was Thomas Praster of the State Department. At the end of March, he was joined by US Army Lieutenant Colonel Randolph Hampton, who worked under contract with the USAID providing overwatch to the rebuilding of schools and medical clinics throughout Paktia, Khost, and Ghazni Provinces.

Security was always an issue as the 100 by 125 foot mud-walled compound was attacked over 35 times by 105 mm rockets and RPGs. The PRT initiative expanded throughout most of the provinces for the purpose of reconstruction and reconciliation programs throughout Afghanistan. The 1st Provincial Reconstruction Team laid the critical cornerstones to future PRT initiatives throughout Afghanistan.
PRTs were part of the NATO-led ISAF mission beginning on October 5, 2006 .
The training for the majority of the American PRTs took place at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and was later moved to Camp Atterbury, Indiana. The training was overseen by the 189th Infantry Brigade, which specialized in training PRTs. Other units, including the 158th Infantry Brigade, supported the 189th as it trained the PRTs in groups of twelve at a time. The training took anywhere from six weeks to three months.

After returning from an international conference in Munich in mid-February 2011, Afghan President Hamid Karzai accused foreign reconstruction teams of undermining efforts to build up the state&#x27;s institutions, and said they would have to go as Afghan forces take over security. &quot;Afghanistan clearly explained its viewpoint on Provincial Reconstruction Teams and structures parallel to the Afghan government - private security companies and all activities or bodies which are hindering the Afghan government&#x27;s development and hindering the governance of Afghanistan,&quot; he said. Meanwhile, five rocket-propelled grenades hit a newly built South Korean military base in Parwan Province, northern Afghanistan, which housed hundreds of members of Korea&#x27;s provincial reconstruction team and civilian aid workers. No one was injured in the attack, but it came hours after a visit by South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin, raising suspicions of Taliban involvement. The opening ceremony of the base was postponed indefinitely.

==Iraq PRTs==
The PRT concept was imported from Afghanistan into Iraq in 2005. That year, 10 PRTs were established in Nineveh, at-Ta&#x27;Mim, Saladin, Diyala, Basra (UK), Dhi Qar (Italy), Erbil (South Korea), Baghdad, Anbar, and Babil. As part of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, the number of PRTs was expanded to cover every province in the country. Additionally, ePRTs were rolled out to work with the sub-provincial levels of government. By 2008, there were 31 PRTs, including 13 ePRTs, located throughout Iraq. Beginning in 2008, a PRT including USDA agricultural advisers worked with Iraqi farmers and created the Green Mada&#x27;in Association for Agricultural Development, an agricultural cooperative of 800 farmers in Mada&#x27;in Qada. The book, &quot;We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for Iraqi Hearts and Minds&quot;, by former PRT Team Leader Peter Van Buren, covers the Green Mada&#x27;in and other reconstruction projects in Iraq. PRTs are no longer operative in Iraq.

==Relationship with NGOs==
Many NGOs were critical of PRT activity, claiming that the mixture of humanitarian and military operations had &quot;blurred the line&quot; between combatant and civilian. Organizations such as Save the Children, CARE International, and InterAction have all complained that PRTs put aid workers at risk. However, evidence of such a relationship has largely been anecdotal. Empirical studies on aid worker insecurity in Afghanistan have failed to show a statistically significant relationship between attacks on NGOs and their proximity to the military in general and PRTs specifically. Watts (2004) did not find evidence indicating heightened aid worker insecurity in provinces where the US military was present. Similarly, Mitchell (2015) was unable to discover a relationship between attacks against NGOs and their proximity to US-led PRTs.

In addition, Refugees International made the observation that the cost of PRTs undertaking small-scale reconstruction projects was far higher than the same projects could be accomplished by NGOs and development agencies and recommended that PRTs focus on maintaining security rather than acting as aid agencies.

<text>is a railway station in Hamamatsuchō, Minato, Tokyo, Japan, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and Tokyo Monorail.

==Lines==
Hamamatsuchō Station is served by two JR East lines: the circular Yamanote Line and the Keihin-Tōhoku Line. All trains on these lines stop at Hamamatsuchō.

It is also the terminus of the Tokyo Monorail line to Haneda Airport. The official name of the monorail station is .

==Station layout==
===JR East===

The JR East station consists of two platforms serving four tracks, with cross-platform interchange in the direction of travel between the Yamanote line (tracks 2 and 3) and the Keihin-Tōhoku line (tracks 1 and 4).

===Tokyo Monorail===
The Tokyo Monorail platforms are located to the west of the JR station in a separate elevated structure. Two side platforms serve a single track, with one platform used for boarding passengers, and the other platform used for alighting passengers.

Japan&#x27;s domestic airlines (JAL, ANA, Skymark Airlines, and Air Do) operate check in services for domestic flights from Haneda airport along with ticketing facilities just outside the main Monorail entrances.

==Facilities==
* Japan Airlines at one time operated a domestic flights only ticketing facility on the third floor of the station.

==History==
The JR station opened on December 16, 1909, as an intermediate station on the newly opened Shinagawa to Karasumori section of the Japanese National Railways.

The Tokyo Monorail station opened on September 17, 1964.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 155,784 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the sixteenth-busiest station operated by JR East. Over the same fiscal year, the Tokyo Monorail station was used by an average of 108,080 passengers daily (exiting and entering passengers), making it the busiest station operated by Tokyo Monorail.

The passenger figures for the JR East station (boarding passengers only) for previous years are as shown below.

<text>The Bobbio Orosius (Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana MS D. 23. Sup.) is an early 7th century Insular manuscript of the &quot;Chronicon&quot; of Paulus Orosius. The manuscript has 48 folios and measures 210 by 150 mm. It is thought to have been produced at the scriptorium of Bobbio Abbey, which was founded by Saint Columbanus in 612. It appears in an inventory of the monastic library done in 1461. The monks gave the manuscript to the Ambrosian Library when it was founded in 1606 by Cardinal Federico Borromeo. 

== Contents ==

=== Carpet page ===
It contains the earliest surviving carpet page in Insular art. The carpet page is on folio 1v. Although it is simpler in design than later carpet pages and contains motifs not found in later carpet pages, it shows a subtlety of pattern and alternation of colors common to Insular manuscripts. It consists of a large central rosette surrounded by four corner rosettes, all contained within a rectangular frame. The vertical panels of the frame contain cable motifs; the frame on the left has a single larger cable of white on pink, while the frame on the right has two smaller cables of white on pink separated by a yellow bar. The upper and lower panels are broken into smaller square panels separated by thin bars. The smaller panels are composed of chevrons and triangles that alternate in pink and yellow. The side top and bottom panels continue to the right edge of the frame. Above the left vertical frame there are two square frames containing circular motifs; the top with a cross inside a circle, and the bottom with a rosette. The cross within the circle in the top panel is similar to the cross within a circle found in the center of the carpet page on folio 192v of the &quot;Book of Durrow&quot;. Six concentric circles surround the central rosette. The page is faded and damaged so that it is difficult to be certain of its original appearance. It has been suggested that the carpet page is later addition to the manuscript.

The carpet page faces the first page of text in the manuscript. The initial P and the opening words &quot;Praeceptis tuis par(rui)&quot; are many times larger than the rest of the text and are of hollow shafted capitals, with stem of the P descending the entire length of the text block. The capitals are filled with pink and orange pigment. There is an initial D on folio 5 which is outlined by dots and is filled with orange. There is also a larger initial N on folio 33 that has a cable pattern in white on orange in the uprights. The crossing bar is green, while orange dots fill the background.

<doc id="383032" wikidata="Q431503" url="?curid=383032" title="Lyman Spitzer">
<text>Lyman Spitzer Jr. (June 26, 1914 – March 31, 1997) was an American theoretical physicist, astronomer and mountaineer. As a scientist, he carried out research into star formation and plasma physics and in 1946 conceived the idea of telescopes operating in outer space. Spitzer invented the stellarator plasma device and is the namesake of NASA&#x27;s Spitzer Space Telescope. As a mountaineer, he made the first ascent of Mount Thor, with Donald C. Morton.

==Early life and education==
Spitzer was born to a Presbyterian family in Toledo, Ohio, the son of Lyman Spitzer Sr. and Blanche Carey (née Brumback). Through his paternal grandmother, he was related to inventor Eli Whitney. Spitzer graduated from Scott High School. He then attended Phillips Academy from 1929 to 1931 and went on to Yale College, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1935 and was a member of Skull and Bones. During a year of study at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, he was influenced by Arthur Eddington and the young Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Returning to the U.S., Spitzer received his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University in 1938 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;The spectra of late supergiant stars&quot;, under the direction of Henry Norris Russell.

==Mountaineering==
In 1965, Spitzer and Donald Morton became the first to climb Mount Thor , located in Auyuittuq National Park, on Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada. As a member of the American Alpine Club, Spitzer established the &quot;Lyman Spitzer Cutting Edge Climbing Award&quot; (Now called the &quot;Cutting Edge Grant&quot;) which gives $12,000 to several mountain climbing expeditions annually.

==Science==

Spitzer&#x27;s brief time as a faculty member at Yale was interrupted by his wartime work on the development of sonar. In 1947, at the age of 33, he succeeded Russell as director of Princeton University Observatory, an institution that, virtually jointly with his contemporary and friend Martin Schwarzschild, he continued to head until 1979.

Spitzer&#x27;s research centered on the interstellar medium, to which he brought a deep understanding of plasma physics. In the 1930s and 1940s, he was among the first to recognize star formation as an ongoing contemporary process. His monographs, &quot;Diffuse Matter in Space&quot; (1968) and &quot;Physical Processes in the Interstellar Medium&quot; (1978) consolidated decades of work, and themselves became the standard texts for some decades more.

Spitzer was the founding director of Project Matterhorn, Princeton University&#x27;s pioneering program in controlled thermonuclear research, renamed in 1961 as Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. He was an early proponent of space optical astronomy in general, and in particular of the project that became Hubble Space Telescope.

In 1981, Spitzer became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

==Death==

Spitzer died suddenly on March 31, 1997, after completing a regular day of work at Princeton University. He was buried at Princeton Cemetery and was survived by wife Doreen Canaday Spitzer (1914-2010), four children, and ten grandchildren. Among Spitzer&#x27;s four children is neurobiologist Nicholas C. Spitzer, who is currently professor and vice chair in neurobiology at UC San Diego.

<doc id="383038" wikidata="Q749649" url="?curid=383038" title="Carpool">
<text>Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car, and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location themselves. Carpooling is considered a Demand-Responsive Transport (DRT) service.

By having more people using one vehicle, carpooling reduces each person&#x27;s travel costs such as: fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving. Carpooling is also a more environmentally friendly and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces air pollution, carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during periods of high pollution or high fuel prices. Car sharing is a good way to use up the full seating capacity of a car, which would otherwise remain unused if it were just the driver using the car.

In 2009, carpooling represented 43.5% of all trips in the United States and 10% of commute trips. The majority of carpool commutes (over 60%) are &quot;fam-pools&quot; with family members.

Carpool commuting is more popular for people who work in places with more jobs nearby, and who live in places with higher residential densities. Carpooling is significantly correlated with transport operating costs, including fuel prices and commute length, and with measures of social capital, such as time spent with others, time spent eating and drinking and being unmarried. However, carpooling is significantly less among people who spend more time at work, elderly people, and homeowners.

==Operation==
Drivers and passengers offer and search for journeys through one of the several mediums available. After finding a match they contact each other to arrange any details for the journey(s). Costs, meeting points and other details like space for luggage are agreed on. They then meet and carry out their shared car journey(s) as planned.

Carpooling is commonly implemented for commuting but is increasingly popular for longer one-off journeys, with the formality and regularity of arrangements varying between schemes and journeys.

Carpooling is not always arranged for the whole length of a journey. Especially on long journeys, it is common for passengers to only join for parts of the journey, and give a contribution based on the distance that they travel. This gives carpooling extra flexibility and enables more people to share journeys and save money.

Some carpooling is now organized in online marketplaces or ride-matching websites that allow drivers and passengers to find a travel match and/or make a secured transaction to share the planned travel cost. Like other online marketplaces, they use community-based trust mechanisms, such as user-ratings, to create an optimal experience for users.

Arrangements for carpooling can be made through many different media including public websites, social media, acting as marketplaces, employer websites, smartphone applications, carpooling agencies and pick-up points.

==Initiatives==

Many companies and local authorities have introduced programs to promote carpooling.

In an effort to reduce traffic and encourage carpooling, some governments have introduced high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes in which only vehicles with two or more passengers are allowed to drive. HOV lanes can create strong practical incentives for carpooling by reducing travel time and expense. In some countries, it is common to find parking spaces reserved for carpoolers.

In 2011, an organization called Greenxc created a campaign to encourage others to use this form of transportation in order to reduce their own carbon footprint.

Carpooling, or car sharing as it is called in British English, is promoted by a national UK charity, Carplus, whose mission is to promote responsible car use in order to alleviate financial, environmental and social costs of motoring today, and encourage new approaches to car dependency in the UK. Carplus is supported by Transport for London, the British government initiative to reduce congestion and parking pressure and contribute to relieving the burden on the environment and to the reduction of traffic-related air-pollution, in London.

However, not all countries are helping carpooling to spread: in Hungary it is a tax crime to carry someone in a car for a cost share (or any payment) unless the driver has a taxi license and there is an invoice issued and taxes are paid. Several people were fined by undercover tax officers during a 2011 crackdown, posing as passengers looking for a ride on carpooling websites. On 19 March 2012 Endre Spaller, a member of the Hungarian Parliament interpellated Zoltán Cséfalvay, Secretary of State for the National Economy, about this practice who replied that carpooling should be endorsed instead of punished, however care must be taken for some people trying to turn it into a way to gain untaxed profit.

== Cost sharing ==
Carpooling usually means to divide the travel expenses equally between all the occupants of the vehicle (driver or passenger). The driver does not try to earn money, but to share with several people the cost of a trip he/she would do anyway. The expenses to be divided basically include the fuel and possible tolls. But if we include in the calculation the depreciation of the vehicle purchase and maintenance, insurance and taxes paid by the driver, we get a cost around $1/mile.
There are platforms that facilitate carpooling by connecting people seeking respectively passengers and drivers. Usually there is a fare set up by the car driver and accepted by passengers because they get an agreement before trip start.

The second generation of these platforms is designed to manage urban trips in real time, using the traveler&#x27;s smartphones. They make possible to occupy the vehicle&#x27;s empty seats on the fly, collecting and delivering passengers along its entire route (and not only at common points of origin and destination). This system automatically performs an equitable sharing of travel costs, allowing each passenger to reimburse the driver a fair share according to the benefit actually gained by the vehicle usage, proportional to the distance traveled by the passenger and the number of people that shared the car.

==History==

Carpooling first became prominent in the United States as a rationing tactic during World War II. Ridesharing began during World War II through &quot;car clubs&quot; or &quot;car-sharing clubs&quot;. The US Office of Civilian Defense asked neighborhood councils to encourage four workers to share a ride in one car to conserve rubber for the war effort. It also created a ride sharing program called the Car Sharing Club Exchange and Self-Dispatching System. Carpooling returned in the mid-1970s due to the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis. At that time the first employee vanpools were organized at Chrysler and 3M.

Carpooling declined precipitously between the 1970s and the 2000s, peaking in the US in 1970 with a commute mode share of 20.4%. By 2011 it was down to 9.7%. In large part this has been attributed to the dramatic fall in gas prices (45%) during the 1980s. In the 1990s it was popular among college students, where campuses have limited parking space. Together with Prof. James Davidson from Harvard, Dace Campbell, Ivan Lin and Habib Rached from Washington, and others, began to investigate the feasibility of further development although the comprehensive technologies were not commercially available yet at the time. Their work is considered by many to be a forerunner of carpooling &amp; ridesharing systems technology used by Garrett Camp, Travis Kalanick, Oscar Salazar and Conrad Whelan at Uber.

The character of carpool travel has been shifting from &quot;Dagwood Bumstead&quot; variety, in which each rider is picked up in sequence, to a &quot;park and ride&quot; variety, where all the travelers meet at a common location. Recently, however, the Internet has facilitated growth for carpooling and the commute share mode has grown to 10.7% in 2005. In 2007 with the advent of smart phones and GPS, which became commercially available, John Zimmer and Logan Green, from Cornell University and University of California, Santa Barbara respectively, rediscovered and created carpooling system called Zimride, a precursor to Lyft. The popularity of the Internet and smart phones has greatly helped carpooling to expand, enabling people to offer and find rides thanks to easy-to-use and reliable online transport marketplaces. These websites are commonly used for one-off long-distance journeys with high fuel costs.

In Europe, long-distance car-pooling has become increasingly popular over the past years, thanks to BlaBlaCar. According to its website, , Blablacar counted more than 80 million users, across Europe and beyond.

, Uber and Lyft have suspended carpooling services in the U.S. and Canada in efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic via social distancing.

==Other forms==
Carpooling exists in other forms:

* Slugging is a form of ad hoc, informal carpooling between strangers. No money changes hands, but a mutual benefit still exists between the driver and passenger(s) making the practice worthwhile.
* Flexible carpooling expands the idea of ad hoc carpooling by designating formal locations for travelers to join carpools.
* Ridesharing companies allow people to arrange ad hoc rides on very short notice, through the use of smartphone applications or the internet. Passengers are simply picked up at their current location.

==Challenges==
* Flexibility - Carpooling can struggle to be flexible enough to accommodate in route stops or changes to working times/patterns. One survey identified this as the most common reason for not carpooling. To counter this some schemes offer &#x27;sweeper services&#x27; with later running options, or a &#x27;guaranteed ride home&#x27; arrangement with a local taxi company.
* Reliability - If a carpooling network lacks a &quot;critical mass&quot; of participants, it may be difficult to find a match for certain trips. The parties may not necessarily follow through on the agreed-upon ride. Several internet carpooling marketplaces are addressing this concern by implementing online paid passenger reservation, billed even if passengers do not turn up.
* Riding with strangers - Concerns over security have been an obstacle to sharing a vehicle with strangers, though in reality the risk of crime is small. One remedy used by internet carpooling schemes is reputation systems that flag problematic users and allow responsible users to build up trust capital, such systems greatly increase the value of the website for the user community.
* Overall efficacy - Though carpooling is officially sanctioned by most governments, including construction of lanes specifically allocated for car-pooling, some doubts remain as to the overall efficacy of carpool lanes. As an example, many car-pool lanes, or lanes restricted to car-pools during peak traffic hours, are seldom occupied by car-pools in the traditional sense. Instead, these lanes are often empty, leading to an overall net increase in fuel consumption as freeway capacity is possibly contracted, forcing the solo-occupied cars to travel slower, leading to reduced fuel efficiency. 
* In 2012, the Queensland government announced it would end carpool lanes (known as Transit Lanes) claiming they were creating congestion and delays. The move was supported by the RACQ motoring group.
* No carpooling service provides the ability for drivers to declare the time range during which they provide services in advance. Although the majority of carpooling services use a mobile application, this is not the case for interurban carpooling services (i.e., Ride joy and Autostrade carpooling) . In addition, no carpooling was found to guarantee a minimum delay for drivers or a single dropoff/pickup point. Some carpooling platforms (i.e., TwoGo and BlaBlaLines operated by BlablaCar) use an intelligent technology to analyze rides from all users to find the best fit for each user. This intelligent technology even factors in real-time traffic data to calculate precise routes and arrival times.

== In popular culture ==
*In the 1970s, the &quot;US Department of Transportation &quot; released a humorous, animated public service announcement to promote carpooling entitled &quot;Kalaka.&quot; In the commercial, an interviewer is shown talking to Noah, &quot;the original share-the-ride-with-a-friend man.&quot; Noah explains that carpooling is an economical way to get where you&#x27;re going, but back in his time it was known as &quot;kalaka.&quot;
*&quot;Cabbing All the Way&quot; is a book written by author Jatin Kuberkar that narrates a success story of a carpool with twelve people on board. Based in the city of Hyderabad, India, the book is a real life narration and highlights the potential benefits of having a carpool.
*The 2017 smartphone game &quot;Crazy Taxi Tycoon&quot; (formerly titled &quot;Crazy Taxi Gazillionaire&quot;) antagonizes ride-sharing as a threat to taxi business, as it becomes a powerful megacorporation that rips off those whom it serves. The player is tasked in hiring taxi drivers to establish a taxi service that offers a more legitimate, friendly and reliable transport experience.
*Carpool Karaoke, best known as a recurring segment from The Late Late Show with James Corden.

<doc id="383044" wikidata="Q2342092" url="?curid=383044" title="Galloway">
<text>Galloway ( ; ; ) is a region in southwestern Scotland comprising the historic counties of Wigtownshire and Kirkcudbrightshire. It is administered as part of the council area of Dumfries and Galloway.

Galloway is bounded by sea to the west and south, the Galloway Hills to the north, and the River Nith to the east; the border between Kirkcudbrightshire and Wigtownshire is marked by the River Cree. The definition has, however, fluctuated greatly in size over history. 

A native or inhabitant of Galloway is called a Gallovidian. The region takes its name from the &quot;Gall-Gàidheil&quot;, or &quot;stranger Gaels&quot;, a people of mixed Gaelic and Norse descent who seem to have settled here in the 10th century. Galloway remained a Gàidhealtachd area for much longer than other regions of the Scottish Lowlands and a distinct local dialect of the Scottish Gaelic language survived into at least the 18th century.

A hardy breed of black, hornless cattle named Galloway cattle is native to the region, in addition to the more distinctive Belted Galloway or &quot;Beltie&quot;.

==Geography and landforms==

Galloway comprises the part of Scotland lying southwards from the Southern Upland watershed and westward from the River Nith. Traditionally it has been described as stretching from &quot;the braes of Glenapp to the Nith&quot;. The valleys of three rivers, the Urr Water, the Water of Ken and River Dee, and the Cree, all running north–south, provide much of the good arable land, although there is also some arable land on the coast. Generally however the landscape is rugged and much of the soil is shallow. The generally south slope and southern coast make for mild and wet climate, and there is a great deal of good pasture.

The northern part of Galloway is exceedingly rugged and forms the largest remaining wilderness in Britain south of the Highlands. This area is known as the Galloway Hills.

==Land use==
Historically Galloway has been known both for horses and for cattle rearing, and milk and beef production are both still major industries. There is also substantial timber production and some fisheries. The combination of hills and high rainfall make Galloway ideal for hydroelectric power production, and the Galloway Hydro Power scheme was begun in 1929. Since then, electricity generation has been a significant industry. More recently wind turbines have been installed at a number of locations on the watershed, and a large offshore wind-power plant is planned, increasing Galloway&#x27;s &#x27;green energy&#x27; production.

==History==
===Mesolithic and Neolithic===

It is thought that aspects of the Barsalloch Fort site in Galloway date to the Mesolithic period. A number of sites date to the Neolithic; these include the Drumtroddan standing stones, the Torhousekie stone circle, and the Cairnholy chambered cairn. There is also evidence of one of the earliest pit-fall traps in Europe which was discovered near Glenluce, Wigtownshire.

===Iron Age===
The Iron Age is where prehistoric archaeological remains and recorded history overlap for Galloway. Galloway&#x27;s Iron Age sites are similar to the rest of Scotland. Its distinctive type sites consist of crannogs, promontory forts, and duns.

Galloway has a preponderance of crannog-type sites compared to certain other regions of Scotland. This is due largely to the region&#x27;s geography favouring lochs (or now-former lochs), as well as a bias toward higher survival rates of undisturbed sites available for archaeological investigation due to loch-draining taking place later in Galloway than in other regions, with the discovery of such sites eliciting antiquarian interest. For example, the Black Loch of Myrton site (which likely dates to around the 5th century BC) was discovered due to loch-draining activities in the area of the Maxwell family estate during the 19th century. The site received the attention of a local antiquarian, Sir Herbert Maxwell, who conducted a basic excavation. Initially thought to be a crannog, the Black Loch of Myrton site was later recharacterized as a &quot;lochside village&quot;.

Promontory forts are highly topographically-defined sites, which in Galloway generally occupy coastal promontories overlooking the Solway Firth. Investigation of one such site at Carghidown revealed a &quot;sporadically occupied refuge&quot; according to Toolis, who also notes that &quot;hardly any promontory forts occupy strongly defensive locations or have immediate access to the sea.&quot; While many surviving sites represent sporadically-occupied locations or individual households, there are also examples of multiple-household settlements. One of these is the Rispain Camp site near Whithorn, which contained a form of bread wheat unique amongst Iron Age sites in Galloway. This is a possible indication that Rispain Camp had different agricultural practices than elsewhere in Galloway, especially given the relatively low occurrence of rotary querns at sites in the area. Roughly contemporary with the Rispain Camp site, a cluster of roundhouses at Dunragit (dating to the early centuries AD) was revealed to contain examples of native (i.e. non-Roman) pottery.

Certain households in Galloway seem to have taken social prominence later in the Iron Age. Lead items appear; isotope analysis of goods at a number of Iron Age and Roman period sites indicate the Scottish Southern Uplands as a possible ore source for the lead material, though it is unclear how early extraction of lead could have taken place in Galloway specifically. Metallurgical testing done on three lead beads recovered from the Carghidown site (dated to ) indicated a closer affinity to the Southern Uplands than to a sample from the Isle of Man. The area around Whithorn, containing both the Carghidown and Rispain Camp sites, appears to have become a local power centre. The Carghidown site is located only a short distance to the east along the coast from St Ninian&#x27;s Cave, while the Rispain Camp site is several miles inland.

Following the start of the Roman conquest of Britain, the Roman general Gnaeus Julius Agricola campaigned northward, reaching Scotland around AD 79. A possible comment about &quot;trackless wastes&quot; may have referred to Galloway, but this is unclear. The source of this comment is the version of Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Agricola&quot; which is contained in the &quot;Codex Aesinas&quot;. The &quot;Codex Aesinas&quot; is a composite work produced in the 15th century, which is based on a now-lost 9th century work, the &quot;Codex Hersfeldensis&quot;, which contained portions of the &quot;Agricola&quot;. The interpretation of &quot;trackless wastes&quot; is based on material thought to derive from the 9th century codex, with an original Latin (&quot;first crossing into the trackless wastes&quot;) having been corrupted into , which is grammatically incorrect in Latin. The interpretation that this passage refers to Galloway is based on contextual information, as the work later refers to &quot;the part of Britain that faces Ireland&quot;, which is seen as referring to southwestern Scotland.


In the 2nd century, the Alexandrian geographer Ptolemy produced his &quot;Geographia&quot;, which was written . This work included Britain. No surviving copies of the &quot;Geographia&quot; exist which are older than the 13th century, creating the possibility that details may have been lost or distorted. Ptolemy credited much of his work to a now-lost atlas by Marinus of Tyre, a previous geographer whose work is thought to have been created around AD 114. Though it would have been written within the century after Agricola&#x27;s campaign, Ptolemy&#x27;s work is a Roman perspective on Britain following the conquest, and not necessarily a reflection of pre-Roman social or ethnic groups. Ptolemy listed two peoples as inhabitants of the area around Galloway: the Novantae in the west (associated with Wigtownshire, Kirkcudbrightshire, and southern Ayrshire) and the Selgovae in the east (primarily associated with modern-day Dumfriesshire). It is thought that the Iron Age inhabitants of the Barsalloch Fort site were the Novantae people. The Rispain Camp site is also associated with the Novantae.

In the west, the city of (literally &#x27;very royal place&#x27;), shown on Ptolemy&#x27;s map of the world, is a strong contender for the site of , referred to in the Welsh Triads as one of the &#x27;three thrones of Britain&#x27; associated with the legendary King Arthur, and may also have been the &quot;&quot; of the sub-Roman Brythonic kingdom of . &#x27;s exact position is uncertain except that it was &#x27;on Loch Ryan&#x27;, close to modern day Stranraer; it is possible that it is the modern settlement of Dunragit ().

According to tradition, before the end of Roman rule in Britain, St. Ninian established a church or monastery at Whithorn, Wigtownshire, which remained an important place of pilgrimage until the Reformation.

===Middle Ages===

A Brythonic speaking kingdom dominated Galloway until the late 7th century when it was absorbed by the English kingdom of Bernicia.

English prevalence was supplanted by Britons and Norse-Gaelic () peoples between the 9th and the 11th century. This can be seen in the context of both the vacuum left by Northumbria being filled by the resurgent Cumbric Britons and the influx of the Norse into the Irish Sea, including settlement in the Isle of Man and in the now English region of western Cumbria immediately south of Galloway.

If it had not been for Fergus of Galloway who established himself in Galloway in the mid-twelfth century, the region would rapidly have been absorbed by Scotland. This did not happen because Fergus, his sons, grandsons and great-grandson Alan, Lord of Galloway, shifted their allegiance between Scottish and English kings. During a period of Scottish allegiance, a Galloway contingent followed David, King of Scots, in his invasion of England and led the attack in his defeat at the Battle of the Standard (1138).

Alan died in 1234, leaving three daughters and an illegitimate son, Thomas (). Alexander II of Scotland, Galloway&#x27;s suzerain, planned to divide Galloway between Alan&#x27;s three daughters and their husbands (all Norman noblemen) and to exclude Thomas under Norman feudal law. However, Thomas considered himself Alan&#x27;s heir under the Gaelic system of tanistry. In the ensuing Galloway revolt of 1234–1235, an army of Galwegian rebels ambushed Alexander&#x27;s royal army and nearly inflicted a defeat before relief forces arrived to support the king. The rebels retreated to Ireland, and Alexander left Walter Comyn, Lord of Badenoch to subdue Galloway; Comyn sacked its abbeys before fleeing when faced with the return of the rebels. The rebellion was eventually ended with the return of royal forces. The result was a partition of Galloway, serving to fragment it administratively, though some ecclesiastical (the bishopric) and judicial (the office of Justiciar of Galloway) offices survived further into the High Medieval period and beyond.

Alan&#x27;s eldest daughter, (Latinized as Dervorguilla), married John de Balliol, and their son (also John) became one of the candidates for the Scottish Crown. Consequently, Scotland&#x27;s Wars of Independence were disproportionately fought in Galloway.

There were a large number of new Gaelic placenames being coined post 1320 (e.g. Balmaclellan), because Galloway retained a substantial Gaelic speaking population for several centuries more. Following the Wars of Independence, Galloway became the fief of Archibald the Grim, Earl of Douglas. In 1369, he received the part of Galloway east of the River Cree, where he appointed a steward to administer the area, which became known as the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. The following year, he acquired the part of Galloway west of the Cree, which continued to be administered by the king&#x27;s sheriff, and so became known as the Shire of Wigtown. The two parts of Galloway thereafter were administered separately, becoming separate counties.

The High Medieval period saw a gradual incorporation of Galloway into Scotland. Scotland&#x27;s legal system was administered as a system of three provinces, each with a justiciar (high official). The Justiciar of Galloway was one of these, along with justiciars for Lothian and &quot;Scotia&quot; (lands north of the Forth and Clyde). Additionally, Whithorn remained an important cultural centre; medieval kings of Scots made pilgrimages there.

===Reformation and Covenanters===
Folklore holds that a copy of the Wycliffe Bible was circulating in Galloway around 1520, and secret groups (proto-conventicles) gathered to hear a man named Alexander Gordon preach from it. With the end of the monasteries, the large ecclesiastical landholdings created under the medieval Lordship of Galloway were broken up amongst hundreds of small landowners. In the case of Dundrennan Abbey, much of the abbey&#x27;s lands came into the hands of the family of its last abbot, Edward Maxwell. Following the death of the pre-Reformation Bishop of Galloway in 1575, there were disputes over who would be bishop, and the see was vacant for a considerable period of time in the late 16th century due to opposition to episcopal polity by the Presbyterian faction within the Church of Scotland.

The Anglo-Scottish Union of the Crowns took place in 1603, leading to the supremacy of the Stuart dynasty in Britain and Ireland. James, the Stuart monarch of both Scotland and England, heavily policed the activities of the riding clans of the nearby Scottish Borders, leading to a large number of Borderers emigrating or being transported to Ireland or to the American colonies. The Plantation of Ulster began around this time.

Attempts beginning under James VI to enforce Caesaropapism, episcopal polity, high church Anglicanism, and Laudianism within the Church of Scotland, ultimately triggered the Presbyterian backlash of the 17th-century Bishops&#x27; Wars, which saw the appearance of the Covenanters as a religious, political, and military force. The Covenanters began as participants in conventicles, which, similarly to the use of Mass stones by the equally illegal Catholic Church in Scotland, were unsanctioned secret religious services that took place outdoors, in barns, or in granaries. The Covenanter movement was particularly popular in the southwest of Scotland. Covenanters had skirmishes with government troops in Galloway, some of which featured the &quot;Galloway flail&quot;, a variant of the agriculturally-derived melee weapon.

===Cattle trade===
Galloway&#x27;s agricultural economy was indirectly affected by the 17th-century Plantation of Ulster. Peasants in Galloway had, dating back to the Middle Ages, traditionally practiced a mixture of dairy-focused pastoral transhumance and intensive agriculture, with pockets of arable land being intensively cultivated by some peasants, while others migrated between upland and lowland pastures with their herds. Landowners such as Sir John Murray, the earl of Annandale, received large land grants in Ulster which were only suitable for pasture. In order for their tenants in Ireland to pay rent, an export market had to be created, which was soon sanctioned by the Scottish Privy Council, for Irish cattle to be exported to England via Galloway. Some landowners used the cattle trade in the 17th century as a way to grow their landholdings, as the system of a large number of small landholders began to consolidate into larger estates. The Irish cattle trade increased until up to 10,000 head of cattle per year were being exported through this route in the year 1667. It was in this year that the importation of Irish cattle to England was banned. However, the importation of Scottish cattle was not banned; this created a new opportunity for Galloway landowners to profit from illicit Irish cattle. By this time, a number of prominent individuals associated with the Stuart monarchy held lands in both Galloway and in Ulster, facilitating the illicit trade, which &quot;may have been tolerated for political reasons&quot;. Many of these landowners were also Episcopalians.

Galwegian Gaelic seems to have lasted longer than Gaelic in other parts of Lowland Scotland, and Margaret McMurray (d. 1760) of Carrick (outside modern Galloway) appears to have been the last recorded speaker.

===Modern history===
In modern times, Stranraer was a major ferry port, but the company have now moved to Cairnryan.

==Galloway in literature==

Galloway has been the setting of a number of novels, including Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Guy Mannering&quot;.
Other novels include the historical fiction trilogy by Liz Curtis Higgs, &quot;Thorn in My Heart&quot;, &quot;Fair is the Rose&quot;, and &quot;Whence Came a Prince&quot;. Richard Hannay flees London to lie low in Galloway in John Buchan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Thirty-nine Steps&quot;. &quot;Five Red Herrings&quot;, a whodunit by Dorothy L. Sayers, initially published in the US as &quot;Suspicious Characters&quot;, sees Lord Peter Wimsey, on holiday in Kirkcudbright, investigating the death of an artist living at Gatehouse of Fleet; the book contains some remarkable descriptions of the countryside. S R Crockett, a bestselling writer of historical romances active before the First World War, set several novels in the region including &quot;The Raiders&quot; and &quot;Silver Sand&quot;.

Galloway is also the setting of several memoirs, including Devorgilla Days written by Wigtownshire author Kathleen Hart, an account of life in Wigtown, Scotland&#x27;s national book town.

With regard to Scottish Gaelic literature, the only text known to survive in Galwegian Gaelic is a song called &quot;Òran Bagraidh&quot;, which was collected from a North Uist seanchaidh by Celticist Donald MacRury.

In Canadian literature, poet and playwright Watson Kirkconnell&#x27;s visit to his ancestral village in the region inspired his original poem &quot;Kirkconnell, Galloway, A.D. 600. Visited A.D. 1953&quot;. The poet pondered how much the culture of the region and the celebration of Christmas Day had changed since Kirkconnell Abbey was founded by St. Conal, a Culdee monk from Gaelic Ireland and missionary of the Celtic Church. The landscape, he commented, remained largely unchanged and called upon his readers to embrace the awe that their ancestors had once felt before the incarnation and birth of Jesus Christ.

<text>Camp Julien was the main base for the Canadian contingent of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Kabul, Afghanistan.

The camp was named after Lance Corporal George Patrick Julien, a Canadian Army soldier who was awarded the Military Medal as a Private, for his actions at Hill 187 in Korea in May 1953. LCpl Julien was a member of 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment, which was the first unit to occupy Camp Julien. 

At its height the camp housed 2,000 Canadian soldiers and over 400 civilian workers, approximately half of whom were Nepalese. The Nepalese workers were responsible for manual labour, including cooking and cleaning. The Canadian workers supervised, and completed tasks in office, warehouse, laundry, maintenance, utilities, cleaning service and food preparation settings. Other workers hailed from South Africa, the United States, the United Kingdom and India. A limited number of local Afghan citizens were employed in the laundry. This was the Canadian military&#x27;s first large-scale camp which was largely run by a third-party independent contractor, in this case SNC Lavalin PAE.

The camp had a good reputation with coalition troops for its amenities which included water and sewage treatment plants and a water bottling facility.

The site closed in November 2005 and was handed over to the Government of Afghanistan.

In April 2007, Camp Julien reopened and was designated a new home for the COIN (Counterinsurgency) Academy. It was a multinational organization that ran a week-long course designed to teach military leaders the basics of counterinsurgency operations.

<text>Lionel Ngakane (17 July 1928 – 26 November 2003) was a South African filmmaker and actor, who lived in exile in the United Kingdom from the 1950s until 1994, when he returned to South Africa after the end of apartheid. His 1965 film &quot;Jemima and Johnny&quot;, inspired by the 1958 &quot;race riots&quot; in Notting Hill, London, won awards at the Venice and Rimini film festivals. In the 1960s, Ngakane was a founding member of the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI) and Fespaco, the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO).

==Biography==
Ngakane was born in Pretoria, South Africa. In 1936, his family and he moved to the Sophiatown neighbourhood of Johannesburg. His father (a teacher) set up a hostel with Alan Paton, author of the 1948 novel &quot;Cry, The Beloved Country&quot;. Ngakane was educated at Fort Hare University College and the University of Witwatersrand, and worked on &quot;Drum&quot; and &quot;Zonk&quot; magazines from 1948 to 1950. In 1950, he began his career in film as an assistant director and actor in the film version of &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; (1951), directed by Zoltan Korda. Shortly thereafter, Ngakane went into exile in the United Kingdom.

As an actor, he appeared in films, including &quot;The Mark of the Hawk&quot; in 1957 (with Eartha Kitt), on television — &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1958) and the spy series &quot;Danger Man&quot; (Deadline, 1962) with Patrick McGoohan, and on stage — in Errol John&#x27;s &quot;Moon on a Rainbow Shawl&quot;, and Wole Soyinka&#x27;s play &quot;The Lion and the Jewel&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in 1966.

Ngakane returned to South Africa after the end of apartheid in 1994.

He is best remembered for his short film &quot;Jemima and Johnny&quot; (1965), inspired by the 1958 &quot;race riots&quot; in Notting Hill, London. It won awards at the Venice and Rimini film festivals. He also directed documentaries on apartheid and African development. He was honorary president of the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers (FEPACI), which organization he had originated in 1967 as a lobbying group for the support of African filmmakers.

He died in Rustenburg, South Africa, in 2003, aged 75.

==Awards and honours==
In 1997, Ngakane was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Natal.

In 2003, he was awarded the South African Order of Ikhamanga in Silver for his &quot;outstanding achievement in the field of movie-making and contribution to the development of the film industry in South Africa and on the continent&quot;.

In 2020, Ngakane was honoured at the RapidLion South African International Film Festival.

<text>Good Times is an American television sitcom that aired for six seasons on CBS, from February 8, 1974, to August 1, 1979. Created by Eric Monte and Mike Evans and developed by executive producer Norman Lear, it was television&#x27;s first African American two-parent family sitcom. It is a spin-off of &quot;Maude&quot;, itself a spin-off of &quot;All in the Family&quot;.

==Synopsis==

Florida and James (renamed from Henry) Evans and their three children live at 721 North Gilbert Avenue, apartment 17C, in a public housing project in a poor, black neighborhood in inner-city Chicago. The project is unnamed on the show but is implicitly the infamous Cabrini–Green Homes, shown in the opening and closing credits. Florida and James have three children: James Jr., also known as &quot;J.J.&quot;, a budding artist and illustrator who thinks of himself as a &quot;Casanova&quot; type and achieves both success and rejection on his path to monetize his talent into a career; Thelma, a very bright girl who takes education very seriously as she sees it as a way to help her family and is shown attending high school and community college over the course of the series; and Michael, whose passionate activism and support for the Black community and Black issues causes his father to call him &quot;the militant midget&quot;.

When the series begins, J.J. is 17 (portrayed by 26-year-old Jimmie Walker, who was just eight years younger than co-star John Amos), Thelma 16 and Michael 11. Their exuberant neighbor and Florida&#x27;s best friend is Willona Woods, a recent divorcée who works at a boutique. Their building superintendent is Nathan Bookman (seasons 2–6), who James, Willona and later J.J. refer to as &quot;Buffalo Butt&quot; or, even more derisively, &quot;Booger&quot;.
The characters originated on the sitcom &quot;Maude&quot; as Florida and Henry Evans, with Florida employed as Maude Findlay&#x27;s housekeeper in Tuckahoe, New York, and Henry employed as a New York City firefighter. When producers decided to feature the Florida character in her own show, they changed the characters&#x27; history to fit a new series that was well into development rather than start from scratch to create a consistent starring vehicle, even though to do so meant changing their Black middle-class family into a poverty-stricken lower class family. Henry&#x27;s name became James, and he worked various odd jobs due to only being able to attain a sixth-grade education. 
There was no mention of Maude. In the episode called &quot;The Checkup&quot;, there was mention of Florida having previously worked as a maid. Additionally, the couple&#x27;s location was now Chicago.

Episodes of &quot;Good Times&quot; deal with the characters&#x27; attempts to overcome poverty, living in high-rise public housing in Chicago. James Evans often works at least two jobs, mostly manual labor such as dishwasher, construction laborer, etc. Though he is often unemployed, he is a proud man who will not accept charity. He sometimes hustles money playing pool, although Florida disapproves of this.

==Episodes==

==Cast and characters==
===Main===

===Supporting===

* Ned the Wino (Raymond Allen) is the local drunk who frequents the neighborhood and the apartment building where the Evans family reside. In the season one episode &quot;Black Jesus&quot;, J.J. uses Ned the Wino as the model for a portrait of Jesus. Another episode is centered on Michael&#x27;s plan to &quot;clean up&quot; Ned and get him off the booze by letting him stay at the Evanses&#x27; house.
* Carl Dixon (Moses Gunn) is a shop owner for whom Michael briefly works. Despite their religious differences, Carl and Florida begin dating and become engaged in the final episode of season four. Carl breaks off the engagement after he is diagnosed with lung cancer. After a talk from Bookman, Carl again asks Florida for her hand in marriage. The two marry off-screen and move to Arizona. Florida returns at the beginning of season six, this time without Carl for Thelma&#x27;s wedding. Carl is referenced briefly in that season&#x27;s second episode &quot;Florida&#x27;s Homecoming Part 2&quot;, but he is never mentioned again (Florida continues to use the surname Evans instead of Dixon). (Rolle decided to come back to the show on the condition the character of Carl Dixon was written out.) While it is not mentioned onscreen, it is implied that Carl died from lung cancer.
* Marion &quot;Sweet Daddy&quot; Williams (Theodore Wilson) is a menacing neighborhood numbers runner and pimp, who has a reputation for wearing flashy clothing and jewelry. He is usually accompanied by bodyguards (one portrayed by Bubba Smith, the other by series painter Ernie Barnes) and comes across as cool and threatening, but has shown a soft heart on occasion, particularly when he decided not to take an antique locket (to settle a debt) that Florida had given to Thelma because it had reminded him of his late mother. (Wilson also plays a club owner named Stanley in the season four episode, &quot;The Comedian and the Loan Sharks&quot;).
* Alderman Fred C. Davis (Albert Reed Jr.) is a local politician with a slightly shady disposition whom the Evans generally despise. Spoofing President Richard M. Nixon, he would state in a speech, &quot;I am not a crook&quot;. He frequently relies on the support of the Evans family (his &quot;favorite project family&quot;) for re-election or support and resorts to threats of eviction to secure their support. In a running joke, Alderman Davis frequently antagonizes Willona by &quot;forgetting&quot; her name, and calling her another similar-sounding name that began with a &quot;W&quot; (such as Wilhemina, Winnifrieda, Winsomnium, Wyomia and even Waldorf-Astoria), thus earning him her everlasting ire as well as the nickname &quot;Baldy&quot;.
* Lenny (Dap &#x27;Sugar&#x27; Willie) (also known as &quot;Lootin&quot; Lenny), is a neighborhood hustler and peddler who tries to sell presumably stolen items that are usually attached to the lining of his fur coat. He usually approaches people with a laid-back rap and a rhyme, such as &quot;my name is Len-nay, if I ain&#x27;t got it, there ain&#x27;t an-nay&quot; (in a style similar to Rudy Ray Moore). He is typically rebuffed by the people he approaches and responds by saying &quot;that&#x27;s cold&quot; or uses a small brush to &quot;brush off&quot; the negativity.
* &quot;Grandpa&quot; Henry Evans (Richard Ward) is James&#x27;s long-lost father. He abandoned the family years before because he was ashamed that he could not do more to provide for them. This deeply hurt James, who disregarded his father&#x27;s existence, telling everyone that he was dead. Thelma learns about her grandfather while doing some family research. She meets him and invites him to the Evanses&#x27; home to surprise James for his birthday, not knowing that James was well aware of his whereabouts but chose to stay out of his life. After Henry arrives at the Evans home and meets the rest of the family, he realizes that James would not welcome him in the home and decides to leave. Florida convinces him to stay and talk to James and explains that there may never be another chance to do so. Henry and James have a heart-to-heart talk, with Henry being remorseful and apologetic. James ultimately forgives his father. After James&#x27;s death, the Evans family embraces Henry into the family, alongside his common law (and eventually legal) wife Lena (Paulene Myers) in later episodes.
* Wanda Williams (Helen Martin) is another resident in the apartment building where the Evans reside. Earlier episodes show her at a women&#x27;s support group, and the tenants rallying around her by giving her a rent party. Later episodes show her appearing and crying at several funerals, whether she knew the person or not, thus earning her the nickname &quot;Weeping Wanda&quot; from J.J. and Willona.
* Lynnetta Gordon (Chip Fields) is Penny&#x27;s abusive biological mother whose first appearance is in the four-part fifth season opening episode, &quot;The Evans Get Involved&quot;. Penny&#x27;s father abandoned her mom when Lynnetta became pregnant at 16. As a result, she takes her anger and frustrations out on Penny, including burning her with a hot iron. After the abuse is finally brought to light, she tells the Evans family that she herself was abused as a child. She gets into a fighting match with Willona and Thelma and they plead for her to seek therapy. Just before she disappears, she expresses regret for hurting her child, telling Willona that Penny deserves better than her. This clears the way for Willona to adopt Penny. She reappears more than a year later, in the sixth-season episode, &quot;A Matter of Mothers&quot;, having gotten married and reveals that her new husband is from a very wealthy family. She uses her husband&#x27;s wealth to send Penny anonymous gifts and, in an effort to regain custody of Penny, also attempts to frame Willona as an unfit adoptive mother who throws wild parties with less than wholesome attendees. Her scheme is exposed by being recorded on tape admitting that the scheme was a set up to get Penny back. After Lynnetta tries to get the tape from Penny and threatens to hurt her again, which is stopped by Willona, Penny tells Lynnetta that no matter what anyone says, she will always consider Willona her real mother. Devastated, Lynnetta decides to drop the charges against Willona and leaves Penny with her, never to be seen again.
* Cleatus (John Bailey) is a cousin of J.J. Evans, Thelma Evans Anderson and Michael Evans and nephew of Florida Evans and James Evans. He made one appearance in the episode &quot;Cousin Cleatus&quot;.
* Violet Bookman (Marilyn Coleman) is the wife of Bookman (episodes: &quot;Bye, Bye Bookman&quot; and &quot;Willona, the Other Woman&quot; in season 5).

==Production==
&quot;Good Times&quot; was created by Eric Monte and actor Mike Evans. The series also features a character named &quot;Michael Evans&quot; after Evans, who portrayed Lionel Jefferson on the Lear-produced series &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;The Jeffersons.&quot;

===Theme song and opening sequence===

The gospel-styled theme song was composed by Dave Grusin with lyrics written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. It was sung by Jim Gilstrap and Motown singer Blinky Williams with a gospel choir providing background vocals. Because of the singing style of the song, and the audio mix, the lyrics to the theme song are notorious for being hard to discern, notably the line &quot;hangin&#x27; in a chow line&quot;/&quot;hangin&#x27; in and jivin&#x27;&quot; (depending on the source used). Dave Chappelle used this part of the lyrics as a quiz in his &quot;I Know Black People&quot; skit on &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; in which the former was claimed as the answer. Closed captioning on streaming services, and the insert for the Season One DVD box set, have the lyric as &quot;hangin&#x27; in a chow line&quot;. The Bergmans, along with Bern Nadette Stanis, confirmed that the lyric is actually &quot;hangin&#x27; in and jivin&#x27;&quot;. Slightly different lyrics were used for the closing credits, with the song beginning on a verse instead of the chorus.

===Casting===
Chip Fields was one of the finalists for the role of Thelma, but Bernadette Stanis was selected. Haywood Nelson screen tested and was hired for the role of the youngest Evans child, Michael, but was replaced by Ralph Carter who, at the time, had more experience in front of a live audience. Carter was a cast member in the Broadway musical &quot;Raisin&quot; and the producers of &quot;Raisin&quot; were initially reluctant to accept Tandem Productions&#x27; buyout offer. While Carter&#x27;s contract was being negotiated, another young actor, Larry Fishburne (later Laurence) filled the role of Michael during initial rehearsals for &quot;Good Times.&quot; Carter, Nelson, and Fishburne (and their families) were all close friends, each close in age, each having Broadway experience, and living in the same neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Because of a contractual obligation, early episodes of &quot;Good Times&quot; contain a notice in the credits: &quot;Ralph Carter appears courtesy of the Broadway musical &quot;Raisin&quot;.&quot;

===Cast conflicts===

&quot;Good Times&quot; was intended to be a family show in the &quot;All in the Family&quot; vein focused on Rolle and Amos. Both expected the show to deal with serious topics in a comedic way while providing positive characters to which viewers can identify. It was Walker&#x27;s character of J.J. that was an immediate hit with audiences and became the breakout character of the series. J.J.&#x27;s frequent use of the expression &quot;Dy-no-mite!&quot; (often in the phrase &quot;Kid Dy-no-mite!&quot;), credited to director John Rich (first delivered by Walker at the end of the Season 1, Episode 2, &quot;Black Jesus&quot;), became a popular catchphrase (later included in TV Land&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catch Phrases&quot; special).

Rich insisted Walker say it in every episode. Walker and executive producer Norman Lear were skeptical of the idea, but the phrase and the J.J. Evans character caught on with the audience. As a result of the character&#x27;s popularity, the writers focused more on J.J.&#x27;s comedic antics instead of serious issues. Throughout seasons two and three, Rolle and Amos grew increasingly disillusioned with the direction of the show and especially with J.J.&#x27;s tomfoolery and stereotypically buffoonish behavior. Rolle was vocal about her hate of his character. In a 1975 interview with &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine she stated: Despite doing so less publicly than Rolle, Amos also was outspoken about his dissatisfaction with the J.J. character, stating: In addition to his criticism of J.J.&#x27;s personality, Amos also greatly criticized what he felt was a greater emphasis on J.J. and more disregard for the other two Evans children, telling the Television Academy Foundation in 2014 that: While Amos was less public with his dissatisfaction than Rolle, he was fired after season three due to disagreements with Lear and the writing staff, which, according to Amos, were often confrontational and heated. Amos&#x27; departure was initially attributed to his desire to focus on a film career, but he admitted in a 1976 interview that Lear called him and told him that his contract option with the show was not being renewed. Amos stated: &quot;That&#x27;s the same thing as being fired.&quot; The producers decided not to recast the character of James Evans, instead opting to kill off the character in the two-part season four premiere, &quot;The Big Move&quot;, with Florida finding out that James died in an automobile accident while in Mississippi setting up a new business opportunity at an auto repair shop, which would have allowed the family to move from the ghetto.

===Final seasons===
By the end of season four, Rolle had also become dissatisfied with the show&#x27;s direction and decided to leave the series. In the two-part season finale, &quot;Love Has a Spot On His Lung&quot;, Florida gets engaged to Carl Dixon (Moses Gunn), a man she began dating toward the end of season four. In the season five premiere episode, &quot;The Evans Get Involved Part 1&quot;, it is revealed that Florida and Carl married off screen and moved to Arizona for the sake of Carl&#x27;s health. With Amos and Rolle gone, DuBois took over as lead actor, as Willona checked in on the Evans children since they were now living alone.

In season five, Janet Jackson joined the cast, playing Penny Gordon, an abused girl, abandoned by her mother, and eventually adopted by Willona. During that season, Johnny Brown&#x27;s character of Nathan Bookman, the Evans&#x27; superintendent, became more prominent. At the beginning of the fifth season, Brown became a series regular and was included in the opening credits. Ratings began to decline. It was clear to the producers as well as viewers that Rolle&#x27;s absence had left the series without a much-needed unifying center of attention.

Before the taping of season six began, CBS and the show&#x27;s producers decided that they had to do &quot;something drastic&quot; to increase viewership. According to then-vice president of CBS programming Steve Mills: &quot;We had lost the essence of the show. Without parental guidance, the show slipped. Everything told us that: our mail, our phone calls, our research. We felt we had to go back to basics.&quot;

Producers approached Rolle with an offer to appear in a guest role on the series. Rolle was initially hesitant, but when producers agreed to a number of her demands (including an increased salary and higher quality scripts), she agreed to return to the series on a full-time basis. Rolle also wanted producers to make the character of J.J. more responsible, as she felt the character was a poor role model for African-American youths. She also requested that producers write out the character of Carl Dixon; Rolle reportedly disliked the storyline surrounding the Carl Dixon character, as she believed Florida would not have moved on so quickly after James&#x27;s death or left her children. Rolle also thought the writers had disregarded Florida&#x27;s devout Christian beliefs by having her fall for and marry Carl, who was an atheist.

In the season six premiere episode &quot;Florida&#x27;s Homecoming: Part 1&quot;, Florida returns from Arizona without Carl to attend Thelma&#x27;s upcoming wedding to professional football player Keith Anderson (Ben Powers, who joined the cast for the final season). In a rare uncut version of &quot;Florida&#x27;s Homecoming: Part 2&quot;, after Florida arrives home from Arizona, Willona briefly pulls her aside and mentions Carl, to which Florida sadly smiles and shakes her head, implying that Carl had died from cancer. Florida later mentions Carl one last time when she tells Michael about a book they&#x27;d both bought him.

Despite changes in the series at Rolle&#x27;s request and her return, plus the addition of Powers to the cast, ratings continued to fall and CBS canceled the series during the 1978–79 season. In the series finale episode &quot;The End of the Rainbow&quot;, each character finally gets a &quot;happy ending&quot;. J.J. gets his big break as a nationally syndicated artist for a comic book company with his newly created character, DynoWoman, which is based on Thelma (much to her surprise and delight) and is moving into an apartment with some lady friends.

Michael attends college and moves into an on-campus dorm. Keith&#x27;s bad knee heals due to his exercise and own physical therapy, leading to the Chicago Bears offering him a contract to play football. Keith announces that he and Thelma are moving into a luxury apartment in the city&#x27;s upscale Gold Coast district. Thelma also announces that she is pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first child.

Keith offers Florida the chance to move in with them so she can help Thelma with the new baby; Florida accepts the offer. Willona becomes the head buyer of the boutique, she walks in and announces that she and Penny are also moving out of the projects. Willona then reveals that her new apartment is in the same apartment building to which Keith, Thelma and Florida are also moving; she and Penny become the Evanses&#x27; downstairs neighbors.

All episodes are available to stream on Peacock and Tubi.

==Reception==
===Ratings===

The program premiered in February 1974; high ratings led CBS to renew the program for the 1974–75 season, as it was the seventeenth-highest-rated program that year. During its first full season on the air, the show was the seventh-highest-rated program in the Nielsen ratings, with more than 25% of all American households tuning into an episode each week. Three of the top ten highest-rated programs on American TV that season centered on the lives of African-Americans: &quot;Sanford and Son,&quot; &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; and &quot;Good Times.&quot; The Nielsen ratings for the series declined over time, partly because of its many time slot changes and the departure of John Amos. The ratings went down considerably when the show entered its final two seasons:

===Awards and nominations===
==Revival==

In September 2020, it was announced that the series would receive an animated sitcom revival with Carl Jones originally attached as showrunner and Norman Lear originally executive producing alongside Seth MacFarlane and Stephen Curry for Netflix. In December 2023, it was announced Ranada Shepard replaced Carl Jones as showrunner for the series. It centers on the current generation of the Evans family, and stars Jay Pharoah, Marsai Martin, Yvette Nicole Brown, Slink Johnson, and J. B. Smoove. The series (titled on-screen as &quot;Good Times: Black Again&quot;) was released on April 12, 2024.

It received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics and audiences with criticism aimed at the animation style, the crass presentation, racist and offensive humor, and general lack of connection to the original series aside from occasional mentions of the James Evans character.

<doc id="383054" wikidata="Q625559" url="?curid=383054" title="Christian communism">
<text>Christian communism is a theological view that the teachings of Jesus compel Christians to support religious communism. Although there is no universal agreement on the exact dates when communistic ideas and practices in Christianity began, many Christian communists argue that evidence from the Bible suggests that the first Christians, including the Apostles in the New Testament, established their own small communist society in the years following Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection. Many advocates of Christian communism and other communists, including Karl Kautsky, argue that it was taught by Jesus and practised by the apostles themselves.
There are those who hold the view that the early Christian Church, such as the one described in the Acts of the Apostles, was an early form of communism or Christian socialism. The view is that communism was just Christianity in practice and Jesus was the first communist.

== History ==
Christian communism was based on the concept of &quot;koinonia&quot;, which means common or shared life, which was not an economic doctrine but an expression of agape love. It was the voluntary sharing of goods amongst the community. Acts 4:35 records that in the early Christian Church in Jerusalem &quot;[n]o one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but shared everything in common.&quot; The pattern helped the early Christians to survive after the siege of Jerusalem and was taken seriously for several centuries. While it later disappeared from church history, it remained within monasticism and was an important supporting factor in the rise of feudalism. This ideal returned in the 19th century with monasticism revival and the rise of religious movements wanting to revive the early Christian egalitarianism. Because they were accused of atheism due its association with Marxism, they preferred &quot;communalism&quot; to describe their Christian communism.
=== Church Fathers ===

The early Church Fathers, like their non-Abrahamic religious predecessors, maintained that human society had declined to its current state from a now lost egalitarian social order. Several historians view the early Christian Church, as described in the Acts of the Apostles (specifically the &quot;omnia sunt communia&quot; reference in Acts 2:44-45 and Acts 4:32-35), as an early form of communism. Among Christian communists, the view is that communism was just Christianity in practice and Jesus was a communist. Later historians across several centuries supported the reading of early church communities as communistic in structure.
=== European High Middle Ages ===
From the High Middle Ages in Europe, various groups supported Christian communist and rural communalist ideas, and these ideas were also occasionally adopted by reformist Christian sects. An early 12th century proto-Protestant group originating in Lyon known as the Waldensians held their property in common in accordance with the Book of Acts but were persecuted by the Catholic Church and retreated to Piedmont.
Around 1300, the Apostolic Brethren in northern Italy were taken over by Fra Dolcino, who formed a sect known as the Dulcinians, which advocated ending feudalism, dissolving hierarchies in the church, and holding all property in common. The Peasants&#x27; Revolt in England has been an inspiration for &quot;the medieval ideal of primitive communism&quot;, with the priest John Ball of the revolt being an inspirational figure to later revolutionaries, and having allegedly declared that &quot;things cannot go well in England, nor ever will, until all goods are held in common.&quot;

=== Renaissance ===
In the 16th century, English writer Thomas More, who is venerated in the Catholic Church as a saint, portrayed a society based on common ownership of property in his treatise &quot;Utopia&quot;, whose leaders administered it through the application of reason.
=== Reformation and early modernity ===
Several groupings in the English Civil War supported this idea, especially Gerrard Winstanley&#x27;s Diggers, who espoused clear communistic and agrarianist ideals. Oliver Cromwell and the Grandees&#x27; attitude to these groups was at best ambivalent and often hostile. Thomas Müntzer led a large Anabaptist communist movement during the 16th-century German Peasants&#x27; War, which Friedrich Engels analysed in &quot;The Peasant War in Germany&quot;.
The Hutterites believed in strict adherence to biblical principles and church discipline, and practised a form of communism. In the words of historians Max Stanton and Rod Janzen, the Hutterites &quot;established in their communities a rigorous system of Ordnungen, which were codes of rules and regulations that governed all aspects of life and ensured a unified perspective. As an economic system, Christian communism was attractive to many of the peasants who supported social revolution in sixteenth century central Europe&quot;, such as the German Peasants&#x27; War, and Engels came to view Anabaptists as proto-communists.
=== Beginning of the Age of Enlightenment ===
Criticism of the idea of private property continued into the Enlightenment era of the 18th century through such thinkers as the deeply religious Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Raised a Calvinist, Rousseau was influenced by the Jansenist movement within the Catholic Church. The Jansenist movement originated from the most orthodox Catholic bishops who tried to reform the Catholic Church in the 17th century to stop secularization and Protestantism. One of the main Jansenist aims was democratizing to stop the aristocratic corruption at the top of the Church hierarchy.
=== Late modern period ===
In Christian Europe, communists were believed to have adopted atheism. In Protestant England, &quot;communism&quot; was too close to the Catholic communion rite, hence &quot;socialist&quot; was the preferred term. Friedrich Engels argued that in 1848, when &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; was published, socialism was respectable in Europe while communism was not. The teachings of Jesus are frequently described as socialist, especially by Christian socialists, such as Terry Eagleton. The Owenites in England and the Fourierists in France were considered respectable socialists, while working-class movements that &quot;proclaimed the necessity of total social change&quot; denoted themselves &quot;communists&quot;. This branch of socialism produced the communist work of Étienne Cabet in France and Wilhelm Weitling in Germany. Weitling was the leader of the Christian communist League of the Just whose stated goal was &quot;the establishment of the Kingdom of God on Earth, based on the ideals of love of one&#x27;s neighbor, equality and justice&quot;. This was also referred to by the League as the &quot;new Jerusalem&quot;. 
In the earliest years of the Mormon movement, Joseph Smith promoted the law of consecration and the concept of the United Order. Today, some Mormon fundamentalist groups still apply this principle. Christian socialism was one of the founding threads of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom and is said to begin with the uprising of John Ball and Wat Tyler in the 14th century.
Pehr Götrek translated &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; into Swedish the same year it was published in German. He made changes in it from his Christian influence, such as changing the now famous quote, &quot;Workers of the world, unite!&quot; to (, or &quot;People&#x27;s voice is God&#x27;s voice&quot;). He also wrote several works criticising the developing capitalist society from a Christian perspective. Igal Halfin of Tel Aviv University argues the Marxist ethos that aims for unity reflects the Christian universalist teaching that humankind is one and that there is only one god who does not discriminate among people.

In 1914 the American socialist leader Eugene Debs declared that &quot;Pure communism was the economic and social gospel preached by Jesus Christ, and every act and utterance which may properly be ascribed to him conclusively affirms it&quot;. He argued that subsequently Christ&#x27;s words have been co-opted and diluted by individuals to serve their own ends.
Early 20th century science fiction author and socialist Olaf Stapledon stated that &quot;Marxism and Christianity spring from the same emotional experience&quot;. Fidel Castro believed, &quot;Christ chose the fishermen because he was a communist&quot;, In his book &quot;Fidel and Religion&quot;, Castro states that there is a &quot;great coincidence between Christianity&#x27;s objectives and the ones we Communists seek, between the Christian teachings of humility, austerity, selflessness, and loving thy neighbour and what we might call the content of a revolutionary&#x27;s life and behaviour&quot;. Castro saw a similarity to his goals with the goals of Christ: &quot;Christ multiplied the fish and the loaves to feed the people. That is precisely what we want to do with the Revolution and socialism&quot;, adding that, &quot;I believe Karl Marx could have subscribed to the Sermon on the Mount&quot;.

Ho Chi Minh, who was venerated as a communist general in Vietnam, although of his Confucianism-origin family, he has well-disposed on Christianity. He said: &quot;The good side of Confucianism is the cultivation of personal ethics. The good side of Christianity is noble benevolence. The good side of Marxism is the dialectical method. The good side of Sun Yat-sen is that his thinking is suitable to the conditions in Vietnam. Do Confucius, Jesus, Marx and Sun Yat-sen not all have the same good side? They all sought the happiness for the people, and prosperity for the society. If today, they were still alive, if they were gathered in the same place, I believe they would certainly be living together in perfect harmony, as good friends. I strive to be their little student&quot;. He also using the language of Christianity and quoting some Bible stories to encourage the spirit of Catholics in Vietnam in the fight against France and America, as well as calling for unity between Catholics and followers of other religions. Ho Chi Minh Thought is said to have absorbed ideals from Christianity.
Nicaraguan Sandinista activist, priest and former Minister for Culture Ernesto Cardenal was a proponent of the idea of Christian communism, saying &quot;Christ led me to Marx...for me, the four Gospels are all equally Communist. I’m a Marxist who believes in God, follows Christ and is a revolutionary for his Kingdom&quot;. He later said &quot;The Bible is full of revolutions. The prophets are people with a message of revolution. Jesus of Nazareth takes the revolutionary message of the prophets. And we also will continue trying to change the world and make revolution. Those revolutions failed, but others will come&quot;.
==== China ====
The participants of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom rebellion, a syncretic Christian-Shenic theocratic kingdom, are viewed by the Chinese Communist Party as proto-communists. Soong Ching-ling, a Methodist, was recognized in China with the title of Honorary President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Basis ==
Christian communists typically regard biblical texts in Acts 2 and Acts 4 as evidence that the first Christians lived in a communist society. Scholars generally agree that the Acts of the Apostles and the Gospel of Luke were written by the same person. In Luke 12:33, Jesus commands his disciples to sell what they have and give alms, and in Luke 14:33 says that no one can be his disciple who has not forsaken all his possessions. Some historians confirm the view that a form of communism was taught by Jesus and practised by the apostles.


Among those historians who support the Christian communist view, Montero offers anthropological evidence that the practices recounted in Acts 4:32–35 were historical and were practised widely and taken seriously during at least the first two centuries of Christianity. Other biblical evidence of anti-capitalistic belief systems include Matthew 6:24, which said: &quot;No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.&quot; The slogan &quot;Each according to his abilities&quot; has biblical origins. Acts 11:29 states: &quot;Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea.&quot; Additionally, the phrase &quot;To each according to his needs&quot; has a biblical basis in Acts 4:35, which says &quot;to the emissaries to distribute to each according to his need&quot;.
Various authors, including Thomas Wharton Collens, José Porfirio Miranda, and José Míguez Bonino, describe biblical sources supporting a common-property society. Bonino wrote: &quot;Is it altogether absurd to re-read the resurrection today as a death of the monopolies, the liberation from hunger, or a solidary form of ownership?&quot; Bonino and Miranda argue against the belief that &quot;Scripture has various meanings&quot;, which in their view allow Western conservative theologians &quot;to prevent the Bible from revealing &quot;its&quot; own subversive message&quot;, and that &quot;use the Biblical text ... to defend the status-quo of a pre-revolutionary situation&quot;, as summarized by Andrew Kirk. Miranda said: &quot;I am not introducing the Bible to Marx. ... I only wish to understand what the Bible says. ... We want to take the Bible seriously.&quot;
Christian communism does not depend merely on the principles of the early apostles, and Christian communists argue that anti-capitalist ideals are deeply rooted in the Christian faith. While modern capitalism had not yet formed in the time of Jesus, his message was overwhelmingly against the love of money and greed, and in support of the poor. Christian communists see the principles of Christ as staunchly anti-capitalist in nature. Since &quot;the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil&quot; (1 Timothy 6:10), it seems natural for Christians to oppose a social system founded—as Christian communists argue—entirely on the love of money. Capitalism is heavily based in the collection of usury, which was condemned for centuries by the Church based in numerous scriptures. Christian opposition to the emergence of such an interest-based system largely delayed capitalist development and capitalism did not gather popular support until John Calvin endorsed capitalist practice from a religious perspective.

== Groups ==

Historically, many groups have practised Christian communism, and may or may not be extant, depending on the case, including:
* Aaronic Order
* Adonai-Shomo
* Amana Colonies (Community of True Inspiration)
* Followers of Thomas Müntzer
* Aurora Colony
* Batenburgers

== Reception ==
Both Christian communism and liberation theology stress orthopraxy in Christianity over orthodoxy. A narrative of the nature of contemporary social struggles is developed via materialist analysis utilizing historiographic concepts developed by Marx. A concrete example are the Paraguayan landless movement &quot;Sin Tierra&quot;, who engage in direct land seizures and the establishment of socialized agricultural cooperative production in . The contemporary Paraguayan &quot;Sin Tierra&quot; operate in a very similar manner as that of the reformation era Diggers. For Camilo Torres Restrepo, the founder of a Colombian guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, developing this orthopraxis meant celebrating the Catholic Eucharist only among those engaged in armed struggle against the army of the Colombian state while fighting alongside them. In Australia, the academic Roland Boer has attempted to synthesize Calvinism and Marxism.
In a September 1962 sermon, Martin Luther King Jr., a democratic socialist and social gospel advocate, said that &quot;no Christian can be a communist&quot;. He stated that &quot;basic philosophy of Christianity is unalterably opposed to the basic philosophy of communism&quot;, citing what he saw as rampant secularism and materialism in communism as evidence that communism &quot;leaves out God&quot;. He further said that &quot;for the communist there is no divine government or no absolute moral order, there are no fixed, immutable principles.&quot; Nevertheless, King acknowledged that &quot;although communism can never be accepted by a Christian, it emphasizes many essential truths that must forever challenge us as Christians.&quot; He added:
The theology of Pope Francis has been described as critical of capitalism, and Pope Francis has been viewed as having some sympathy to socialist causes, with his frequent criticism of capitalism and of neoliberalism. In 2016, Francis said that the capitalist world economy is &quot;[f]undamental terrorism, against all of Humanity&quot;. When questioned on whether or not he is a communist, Francis responded: &quot;As for whether or not I&#x27;m a communist: I am sure that I have not said anything more than what the Church&#x27;s social doctrine teaches ... maybe the impression of being a little more &#x27;of the left&#x27; has been given, but that would be a misinterpretation.&quot; In 2013, he said: &quot;The ideology of Marxism is wrong. But I have met many Marxists in my life who are good people, so I don&#x27;t feel offended.&quot; When asked about being labeled a Leninist by a blog post in &quot;The Economist&quot; in 2014, Francis said: &quot;The communists have stolen our flag. The flag of the poor is Christian. Poverty is at the center of the Gospel.&quot; He added that communism came &quot;twenty centuries later&quot;. In 2024, Pope Francis argued that Christians and Marxists, socialists, and communists shared a common mission and expressed support for the Marxist-Christian dialogue group Dialop.
== Relation with Marxism ==
Christian communists may or may not agree with various parts of Marxism, such as on the way a socialist or communist society should be organized. Christian communists also share some of the political goals of Marxists, for example replacing capitalism with socialism, which should in turn be followed by communism at a later point in the future. The young Louis Althusser and Denys Turner are among Christian or Christianity-influenced philosophers who asserted the coherence of Christianity and Marxism. Althusser said: &quot;I became communist because I was Catholic. I did not change religion, but I remained profoundly Catholic. I don&#x27;t go to church but this doesn&#x27;t matter; you don&#x27;t ask people to go to church. I remained a Catholic, that is, an internationalist universalist. I thought that inside the Communist Party there were more adequate means to realize universal fraternity.&quot; In 1960s Communist Czechoslovakia, dialogue between Marxist and Christian philosophers and theologians was co-organized at Charles University by Milan Machovec in Czech and German, with notable participants including Ernst Bloch and Erich Fromm.
Roland Boer, the son of a Presbyterian minister, said: &quot;There is a tradition within Marxism of engagement with religion that is usually characterised as atheistic and disinterested, but I argue there is a continuous stream of major Marxist figures who have written on questions of religion and engaged specifically with the Bible or with theological debate. Some people contend that Marxism borrowed its main ideas from Christianity and Judaism and reconstructed them as secular ideology, but I think that is extremely simplistic – the relationship is much more complex.&quot; About Karl Marx&#x27;s famous quote about religion being the &quot;opium of the people&quot;, he argues it has been largely misinterpreted, and that at that time opium was both valued and denounced for its medicinal qualities and its addictive potential. He said: &quot;That ambivalence over religion is really what is embodied in Marx&#x27;s metaphor, rather than the notion that it is just a drug that dulls the senses and makes you forget your suffering.&quot; About Christian communism, he said: &quot;The Christian communist tradition is what really interests me and keeps me involved with religion. I am fascinated by the radical, revolutionary dimension of Christianity.&quot;
Latin American liberation theology influenced parts of the evangelical movement and Catholic bishops in the United States. Its purported use of &quot;Marxist concepts&quot; led in the mid-1980s to an admonition by the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF). While stating that &quot;in itself, the expression &#x27;theology of liberation&#x27; is a thoroughly valid term&quot;, the prefect Cardinal Ratzinger rejected certain forms of Latin American liberation theology for focusing on institutionalized or systemic sin and for identifying Catholic Church hierarchy in South America as members of the same privileged class that had long been oppressing Indigenous populations from the arrival of Pizarro onward.

While the theology of Pope Francis has been described as critical of capitalism and sympathetic to socialism, Francis has expressed varying interpretations of Marxism in particular. In 2013, Pope Francis said: &quot;The ideology of Marxism is wrong. But I have met many Marxists in my life who are good people, so I don&#x27;t feel offended.&quot; When asked about being labeled a Leninist by a blog post in &quot;The Economist&quot; in 2014, Francis said: &quot;The communists have stolen our flag. The flag of the poor is Christian. Poverty is at the center of the Gospel.&quot; He added that communism came &quot;twenty centuries later&quot;. In 2024, Pope Francis argued that Christians and Marxists, socialists, and communists shared a common mission and expressed support for the Marxist-Christian dialogue group Dialop.

<text>[[Civil-Military Cooperation Centre of Excellence|Civil-Military Cooperation]] (CIMIC) involves military commanders establishing connections with civilian agencies in operational theaters.

Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC) activities are coordinated through the &quot;G9&quot; staff branch in divisional or other headquarters. In larger joint headquarters, this department is designated as &quot;J9.&quot;

==History==
The United States Army since the Second World War has maintained civil affairs units. Part of their function includes CIMIC tasks, however, they have a much broader function and a different focus from most other CIMIC organizations. In the mid-1990s, primarily in response to lessons learned in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, most NATO members began developing their own CIMIC structures, which lead to the establishment of the Civil-Military Cooperation Centre of Excellence in The Hague in 2001. Germany maintains its own centre.

==Operations==

In areas of operation, civilians including private citizens, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local administration often identify a CIMIC organization through designated &quot;CIMIC Centres.&quot; These centers serve as points of contact for civilians seeking military assistance to address their concerns.

However, formal structures, organizations, and personnel are not the only means of conducting CIMIC functions: every soldier who interacts with civilians, whether deliberately or by chance, can either support or undermine the CIMIC mission. All deployed troops should receive a briefing on CIMIC functions and the procedures they should follow to assist the mission.

In post-conflict scenarios, military units such as engineers, medical teams, and, in some cases, veterinarians are often engaged in civilian interactions. They address challenges like restoring water supply, sanitation, health clinics, and veterinary services. Additionally, tasks like repairing bridges, roads, and electricity supply may be undertaken due to conflict-related damage.

CIMIC activities often involve language and cultural skills training. For soldiers, basic greetings and key phrases can serve as icebreakers, while CIMIC units might have individuals with more advanced language abilities. Locally employed civilians can help with interpretation, and training in cultural etiquette is essential to avoid unintended offensive behavior.

==Doctrine==
The key document explaining NATO CIMIC doctrine is Allied Joint Publication 9. It outlines the three core functions of CIMIC, those being:
#Support to the Force: any activity designed to create support the military force, within the indigenous population.
#Civil-Military Liaison: coordination and joint planning civilian agencies, in support of the military mission.
#Support to the Civil Environment: the provision of any of a variety of forms of assistance (expertise, information, security, infrastructure, capacity-building, etc.) the local population, in support of the military mission.

Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC) involves soldiers trained in engaging with civilians during operations. It is both a capability and a function. Soldiers receive CIMIC training, but many also perform CIMIC tasks as part of routine operations. CIMIC Operators provide expertise and advice to commanders on CIMIC matters, enhancing civilian-military interactions.

CIMIC functions as a force multiplier. For instance, by establishing connections with non-governmental organizations or local officials, CIMIC personnel might identify specific mission threats. This enables them to alert the commander, who can allocate resources to address the threat. This approach reduces the need for extensive patrols and optimizes soldier deployment.

==NATO CIMIC reporting==

There is a vital need for translating relevant information into CIMIC knowledge.

A NATO working group is working to address this issue by developing a CIMIC reporting system that facilitates information sharing across different levels, from tactical to strategic.

In current operations, CIMIC staffs handle extensive information. CECIL working group developed tools to enhance assessments, streamline information flow within CIMIC, and share pertinent info with the staff.

Efforts are needed to enhance collaboration between NATO and civilian partners in operations, with a particular focus on addressing challenges related to information sharing.

The system has been tested and has also proven to be a useful tool to consolidate/collect data for the Afghan Country Stability Picture (ACSP).

The CECIL Working Group identified diverse CIMIC reporting formats, often due to the absence of standardized guidelines across different headquarters.

===Reporting history===

During the Partnership for Peace (PFP) Exercise VIKING &#x27;05, representatives from SHAPE and JFC Brunssum discovered the need for better CIMIC reporting. The ACOSs from ACO at SHAPE and NATO&#x27;s operational headquarters (JFC Brunssum, JFC Naples and JC Lisbon) discussed the issue and established in May 2006 the CECIL Working Group (WG). The WG consists of CIMIC staff officers, one from SHAPE and three from the J(F)C HQs. In addition, subject matter experts can be called upon hen needed. The WG meets every second month. A Sub-WG for training and education was established and supports the introduction of the CECIL system.

===Output of CECIL WG===
The working group developed a set of tools for CIMIC reporting, including a situation report, tracking system, and standardized commander&#x27;s update.

The CIMIC reporting system has been utilized by ISAF CJ9 and JFC Brunssum J9 on a weekly basis since February 2007. It is being progressively introduced to regional commands. This subject was addressed in the new CIMIC staff officer&#x27;s course at NATO School in Oberammergau, Germany.

===Summary===
&quot;This CECIL-tool is ideal for the CIMIC branches to manage their information which assists to stabilize the mission area. Information sharing through one database is essential for civilian and military partners.&quot; CECIL is designed to focus on the most important issues. The Afghan Country Stability Picture gives operators at all levels the relevant facts in an efficient and convenient package.

The output of the working group so far is quite promising. The working group will be mandated for another year to continue working on the new established CIMIC information-sharing platform.

==Additional information==
===CIMIC===
Civil-military cooperation (CIMIC) refers to the interaction between NATO-led forces and civil actors in alliance-led operations.

===Civil Military Overview / Civil Military Fusion Centre===
The Civil Military Overview (CMO) is an experimental portal supported by a dedicated information and knowledge management organization, the Civil Military Fusion Centre (CFC). Both are part of a development effort conducted by NATO Allied Command Transformation in consultation with various civil organizations. It is designed to improve interaction between civil and military actors. Through the CMO, NATO and its partners are exploring innovative ways to collect and disseminate all relevant civil and military information on Crisis Response Operations in order to begin creating a shared sense of situational awareness among the global community.

===CECIL===
The CECIL Working Group was formed to improve CIMIC reporting. CECIL (Coordinated, Effect Based, CIMIC Information Link) aims to assist NATO CIMIC staff with contemporary challenges. The platform enables sharing of CIMIC knowledge to aid staff at all levels.

===ACSP===
The Afghanistan Country Stability Picture (ACSP) project is an initiative led by NATO&#x27;s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to develop and maintain a comprehensive geographic database of reconstruction and development activities across Afghanistan. ACSP holds information about different Afghan national development strategy sectors such as education, good governance, health, agriculture and rural development, infrastructure and natural resources, private sector development, security, and social protection. The data held in the ACSP comes from several sources: the Government of Afghanistan (GOA), Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT), and international, governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGO). 
To provide efficient access to the ACSP data, NATO C3 agency developed a web map service. The ACSP web site can be used to consult and query the ACSP database over the internet. NATO, NGOs and the GOA can use it for optimization and monitoring of reconstruction efforts.

<text>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is the principal public agency for conducting criminal prosecutions in England and Wales. It is headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions.

The main responsibilities of the CPS are to provide legal advice to the police and other investigative agencies during the course of criminal investigations, to decide whether a suspect should face criminal charges following an investigation, and to conduct prosecutions both in the magistrates&#x27; courts and the Crown Court.

The Attorney General for England and Wales superintends the CPS&#x27;s work and answers for it in Parliament, although the Attorney General has no influence over the conduct of prosecutions, except when national security is an issue or for a small number of offences that require the Attorney General&#x27;s permission to prosecute.

==History==
Historically prosecutions were conducted through a patchwork of different systems. For serious crimes tried at the county level, justices of the peace or the sheriff would issue a presentment to a grand jury, who would either return a &quot;true bill&quot; resulting in an indictment, or not. If a true bill followed presentment, the individual would be tried by a petit jury by justices of the King&#x27;s Bench, Common Pleas or Exchequer as they toured the circuits conducting the assizes. Individuals could be prosecuted upon indictment by prosecutors ranging from the Attorney-general or Solicitor-general, king&#x27;s serjeants or attorneys, prosecutors instructed by the sheriff or justice of the peace. It was more likely that the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General would be involved in prosecutions of serious crimes such as high treason at the Court of King&#x27;s Bench at Westminster Hall.

The second means of prosecution was by &quot;appeal&quot;, which was when the prosecution was initiated not by presentment to a grand jury but by direct private prosecution of an interested party. An &quot;appeal of murder&quot; prosecuted by the widow of a murdered man was typical of this form of prosecution.

Sir John Maule was appointed to be the first Director of Public Prosecutions for England and Wales in 1880, operating under the Home Office; his jurisdiction was only for decisions as to whether to prosecute in a very small number of difficult or important cases; once prosecution had been authorised, the matter was turned over to the Treasury Solicitor. Police forces continued to be responsible for the bulk of cases, sometimes referring difficult ones to the Director.

In 1962 a Royal commission recommended that police forces set up independent prosecution teams so as to avoid having the same officers investigate and prosecute a case. Technical barriers were already in place that those prosecuting did so as private citizens, rendering them open to the range of evidential offences imposable by the court. This Royal Commission&#x27;s recommendation was not implemented by all police forces, however, and so in 1977, another was set up, this time headed by Sir Cyril Philips. It reported in 1981, recommending that a single unified team, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), be made responsible for all public prosecutions in England and Wales. The example of the Procurator Fiscal system in Scotland was influential in encouraging this recommendation. A White paper was released in 1983, becoming the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, which established the CPS under the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions, consisting of a merger of his old department with the police prosecution departments. It became operational on 1 October 1986.

In 1997, the Home Office tasked Sir Iain Glidewell to inquire into performance of and make recommendations for the CPS. The Glidewell Report of June 1998 found that 12% of charges by police were discontinued by the CPS and that there were failures to communicate between the two. It recommended the CPS:
*focus resources more on serious crimes at the Crown Court level
*co-operate more with the police in each case
*concurring with an existing government plan, restructure the organisation into 42 regional branches, each with own Chief Crown Prosecutor.

===Employment tribunal claim===
Rebecca Lawrence, who was the chief executive of the CPS from 2019 to 2023, brought a claim against the organisation for age and sex discrimination. This was settled after the first day of the tribunal in November 2023. Lawrence then announced that she was leaving the organisation, saying this was a &quot;natural transition point for the CPS&quot;.

==Organisation==
The CPS undertook more than 800,000 prosecutions in 2012–13, approximately 700,000 of which were in the magistrates&#x27; courts and 100,000 in the Crown Court. The conviction rate was 86% in the magistrates&#x27; courts and 80% in the Crown Court.

The Spending Review undertaken by HM Treasury in 2010 (and revised in 2013) has led to a budget decrease of almost 30% between 2010 and 2014, resulting in a restructure of the organisation and a large number of voluntary redundancies. The CPS has implemented measures such as the Core Quality Standards with the intention of maintaining and raising standards.

===People===
As of 2023, the CPS employs about 7,000 staff. They primarily prepare cases for internal and external advocates and liaise with police and third parties. Its approved external advocates number 2,900 solicitors and barristers, among which are specialists. Both sets of advocates include King&#x27;s Counsel—concentrated externally.

;Grades of staff
*Crown Advocates present cases in the Crown Court
*Senior Crown Prosecutors (also known as reviewing lawyers) provide advice to investigators, make charging decisions and present prosecution cases in the Magistrates Court.
*Associate Prosecutors represent the CPS in cases with guilty pleas in the magistrates&#x27; courts
*Paralegals/casework assistants provide clerical support and help with progressing cases.

===Structure===
Headquartered in London and York, the senior management team sets policies and handles corporate matters such as finance and communications. The Director of Public Prosecutions is assisted by the CPS Chief Executive in running the organisation.

====CPS Areas====
Most of its casework is dealt with by the fourteen CPS Areas, which are responsible for conducting prosecutions in specific parts of England and Wales; each area is led by a Chief Crown Prosecutor. 

The areas are composed of police force areas, except in London where the Metropolitan Police are split across two areas. They are:
* Cymru/Wales (Dyfed Powys, Gwent, North Wales, South Wales)
* East Midlands (Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire)
* Eastern (Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk)
* London North (Metropolitan)
* London South (City of London, Metropolitan)
* Mersey Cheshire (Cheshire, Merseyside)
* North East (Cleveland, Durham, Northumbria)
* North West (Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire)
* South East (Kent, Surrey, Sussex)
* South West (Avon and Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, Gloucestershire)
* Thames and Chiltern (Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Thames Valley)
* Wessex (Dorset, Hampshire &amp; Isle of Wight, Wiltshire)
* West Midlands (Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Mercia, West Midlands and British Transport Police)
* Yorkshire and the Humber (West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Humberside)

Before a review, these numbered 42 to mirror the police forces (save that CPS London dealt with both of London&#x27;s territorial police forces).

====CPS Direct====
CPS Direct provides charging advice/authorisation by phone and electronically to police forces at all hours. Prosecutors assigned to CPS Direct are remote workers in order to provide support outside of normal business hours. Most charging decisions by the CPS are now made by CPS Direct, which then passes the prosecution to the appropriate CPS Area.

====Casework Divisions====
The Casework Divisions deal with prosecutions requiring specialist knowledge and experience:

* Special Crime and Counter-Terrorism Division – Appeals, counter-terrorism, and special crime, which includes deaths in custody, public corruption, and medical manslaughter. The division is also responsible for the Victims Right to Review Scheme.
* Serious Economic, Organised Crime and International Directorate - This consists of the former Proceeds of Crime Unit, Specialist Fraud, and International Justice and Organised Crime Divisions

===Oversight===
The Attorney General oversees the work of the CPS, meeting regularly with the DPP and requesting briefings on matters of public or Parliamentary concern. The Attorney General (or their deputy, the Solicitor General) answer for the CPS&#x27;s performance and conduct in Parliament.

However, the Attorney General has no role in the day-to-day running of the organisation or in deciding whether a suspect should be prosecuted. The CPS is an independent prosecuting authority and government ministers have no influence over its decision making.

The only exceptions to this rule are when a case involves matters of national security or the Attorney General must personally consent to a prosecution (e.g. all Official Secrets Act prosecutions require the Attorney General&#x27;s permission to proceed).

Due to the Attorney General&#x27;s limited role in the CPS&#x27;s casework, the use of nolle prosequi (halting of proceedings on indictment; a prerogative of the Attorney General) is now rare. Questionable incidents, such as the dropping of the case against John Bodkin Adams for what was believed to be purely political reasons, have not been repeated in modern times.

===Inspection===
His Majesty&#x27;s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI) is responsible for inspecting the work of the CPS. The current Chief Inspector of the CPS is Kevin McGinty.

==Roles and responsibilities==

===Pre-charge advice===
The CPS will often provide confidential advice to investigators on the viability of a prosecution in complex or unusual cases. This includes clarifying the intent needed to commit an offence or addressing shortcomings in the available evidence.

Unlike in many other jurisdictions, the CPS has no power to order investigations or direct investigators to take action. Whether the CPS is asked for advice or a charging decision is entirely at the discretion of investigators (see History for background on this division of responsibilities in England &amp; Wales).

===Charging decisions===
The Crown Prosecution Service is responsible for charging suspects with indictable offences (e.g. murder, rape) and all other criminal offences that lay beyond the prosecutorial authority of the police. Police forces can charge suspects with less serious summary offences (e.g. common assault, criminal damage with a low value) but cannot charge suspects with indictable offences without authorisation from a crown prosecutor (except in certain emergency situations).

The &quot;Code for Crown Prosecutors&quot; requires prosecutors to answer two questions in the &quot;Full Code Test&quot;: &quot;Is there sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction?&quot; (in other words, is there sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against each suspect on each charge). The code outlines this means that an objective, impartial and reasonable jury or bench of magistrates or judge hearing a case alone, properly directed and acting in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged. The second question asked is: &quot;Is a prosecution required in the public interest?&quot; These questions must be answered in this order; if there is insufficient evidence, the public interest in prosecuting is irrelevant.

According to the code, if there is insufficient evidence to prosecute, no further action will be taken against the suspect or the prosecutor will ask the police to carry out further inquiries to gather more evidence. When there is sufficient evidence but a prosecution is not required in the public interest, prosecutors can decide that no further action should be taken or that a caution or reprimand is a suitable alternative to prosecution.

In limited circumstances, where the Full Code Test is not met, the Threshold Test may be applied to charge a suspect. The seriousness or circumstances of the case must justify the making of an immediate charging decision, and there must be substantial grounds to object to bail. There must be a rigorous examination of the five conditions of the Threshold Test to ensure that it is only applied when necessary and that cases are not charged prematurely. All five conditions must be met before the Threshold Test can be applied. Where any of the conditions are not met, there is no need to consider any of the other conditions, as the Threshold Test cannot be applied and the suspect cannot be charged. The five conditions that must be met before a Threshold Test can be applied are as follows:

# There are reasonable grounds to suspect that the person to be charged has committed the offence
# Further evidence can be obtained to provide a realistic prospect of conviction
# The seriousness of the circumstances of the case justifies the making of an immediate charging decision
# There are continuing substantial grounds to object to bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1976 and in all the circumstances of the case it is proper to do so
# It is in the public interest to charge the suspect

A decision to charge under the Threshold Test must be kept under review. The prosecutor should be proactive to secure from the police the identified outstanding evidence or other material in accordance with an agreed timetable. The evidence must be regularly assessed to ensure that the charge is still appropriate and that continued objection to bail is justified. The Full Code Test must be applied as soon as the anticipated further evidence or material is received and, in any event, in Crown Court cases, usually before the formal service of the prosecution case.

===Conducting prosecutions===
Whether a decision to charge is taken by police or prosecutors, the CPS will conduct the case, which includes preparing the case for court hearings, disclosing material to the defence and presenting the case in court. The CPS will be represented in court from the first hearing through to conviction/sentencing and in some cases appeal.

All prosecutions must be kept under continuous review and stopped if the Full Code Test (see above) is no longer satisfied or was never satisfied (i.e. the decision to charge was wrong). Mishandling of a case, such as failing to disclose evidence, can result in the courts either acquitting a defendant or quashing the conviction on appeal.

===Appeals===
When an appeal against conviction or sentence is lodged by a defendant, the CPS will decide whether or not to oppose the appeal after considering the grounds of appeal. If it decides to oppose, it will present relevant evidence and material to assist the appellate court.

Exceptionally, the CPS has invited defendants to appeal when it has concluded that the safety of a conviction was questionable, for example in the case of undercover police officer Mark Kennedy.

===Extradition===
The Extradition Act 2003 tasks the CPS with representing foreign states in extradition proceedings, heard at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court. While it acts on the foreign prosecutor&#x27;s instructions, the CPS retains discretion on how the case should be prosecuted.

The Extradition Unit at CPS Headquarters deals with all cases in which the extradition of a person within England and Wales is sought by another state and all cases in which the CPS is seeking the extradition of an individual outside the European Union. The CPS Areas prepare and manage their own extradition requests under the European Arrest Warrant framework.

== Attorney General&#x27;s Treasury Counsel ==
Treasury Counsel are specialist advocates who prosecute many of the most serious and complex cases in the country; they are led by a &quot;First Senior Treasury Counsel (Criminal)&quot; and is composed of ten senior and seven junior Treasury Counsel. Treasury Counsel (Criminal) are so-named because historically they were also instructed by the Treasury Solicitor (who in earlier times was also Director of Public Prosecutions), although criminal prosecution is now overseen by the independent Crown Prosecution Service.

=== Current First Senior Treasury Counsel ===

* Tom Little KC (2024–present)

=== Former First Senior Treasury Counsel ===

* John Nutting QC (1993–1995)
* David Calvert-Smith QC (1995–1998)
* Orlando Pownell QC (1999–2002)
* Richard Horwell QC (2002–2006)
* Mark Ellison QC (2006–2008)
* Jonathan Laidlaw QC (2008–2010)
* Brian Altman QC (2011–2013)
* Richard Whittam QC (2013–2015)
* Mark Heywood QC (2015–2018)
* Duncan Penny QC (2018–2020)
* Oliver Glasgow KC (2021– 2024)

==Controversy==

===Julian Assange===

The CPS faced embarrassment after it destroyed key emails relating to Julian Assange. Email exchanges between the CPS and the Swedish Prosecution Authority were deleted after CPS lawyer Paul Close retired from the CPS in 2014. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the CPS &quot;unaccountably advised the Swedes in 2010 or 2011 not to visit London to interview Assange. An interview at that time could have prevented the long-running embassy standoff.&quot; The 2011 email advised the Swedes to interview Assange &quot;only on his surrender to Sweden and in accordance with Swedish law&quot;.

===Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan===
On 30 October 2020, the Crown Prosecution Service declined to prosecute Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, a member of the UAE royal family, who was accused by the curator of the inaugural Hay festival in Abu Dhabi, Caitlin McNamara, of sexually assaulting her during a meeting to discuss human rights concerns. McNamara had been seeking a prosecution in the UK, but the CPS concluded that it could not prosecute Nahyan, as the alleged offence happened outside its jurisdiction.

<text>RP-1 (Rocket Propellant-1 or Refined Petroleum-1) and similar fuels like RG-1 and T-1 are highly refined kerosene formulations used as rocket fuel. Liquid-fueled rockets that use RP-1 as fuel are known as kerolox rockets. In their engines, RP-1 is atomized, mixed with liquid oxygen (LOX), and ignited to produce thrust. Developed in the 1950s, RP-1 is outwardly similar to other kerosene-based fuels like Jet A and JP-8 used in turbine engines but is manufactured to stricter standards. While RP-1 is widely used globally, the primary rocket kerosene formulations in Russia and other former Soviet countries are RG-1 and T-1, which have slightly higher densities.

Compared to other rocket fuels, RP-1 provides several advantages with a few tradeoffs. Compared to liquid hydrogen, it offers a lower specific impulse, but can be stored at ambient temperatures, has a lower explosion risk, and although its specific energy is lower, its higher density results in greater energy density. Compared to hydrazine, another liquid fuel that can be stored at ambient temperatures, RP-1 is far less toxic and carcinogenic. 

==Usage and history==

RP-1 is a fuel in the first-stage boosters of the Electron, , , Delta I-III, Atlas, Falcon, Antares, and  rockets. It also powered the first stages of the , Titan I, Saturn I and IB, and Saturn V. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is also developing an RP-1 fueled engine for its future rockets.

===Development===
During and immediately after World War II, alcohols (primarily ethanol, occasionally methanol) were commonly used as fuels for large liquid-fueled rockets. Their high heat of vaporization kept regeneratively-cooled engines from melting, especially considering that alcohols would typically contain several percent water. However, it was recognized that hydrocarbon fuels would increase engine efficiency, due to a slightly higher density, the lack of an oxygen atom in the fuel molecule, and negligible water content. Regardless of which hydrocarbon was chosen, it would also have to replace alcohol as a coolant.

Many early rockets burned kerosene, but as burn times, combustion efficiencies, and combustion-chamber pressures increased, engine masses decreased, which led to unmanageable engine temperatures. Raw kerosene used as coolant tends to dissociate and polymerize. Lightweight products in the form of gas bubbles cause cavitation, and heavy ones in the form of wax deposits block narrow cooling passages in the engine. The resulting coolant starvation raises temperatures further, and causes more polymerization which accelerates breakdown. The cycle rapidly escalates (i.e., thermal runaway) until an engine wall rupture or other mechanical failure occurs, and it persists even when the entire coolant flow consists of kerosene. In the mid-1950s rocket designers turned to chemists to formulate a heat-resistant hydrocarbon, with the result being RP-1.

During the 1950s, LOX (liquid oxygen) became the preferred oxidizer to use with RP-1, though other oxidizers have also been employed.

==Fractions and formulation==
RP-1 is outwardly similar to other kerosene-based fuels, but is manufactured to stricter standards. These include tighter density and volatility ranges, along with significantly lower sulfur, olefin, and aromatic content.

Sulfur and sulfur compounds attack metals at high temperatures, and even very small amounts of sulfur assist polymerization. Therefore, sulfur and sulfur compounds are kept to a minimum.

Unsaturated compounds (alkenes, alkynes, and aromatics) are also held to low levels, as they tend to polymerize at high temperatures and long periods of storage. At the time, it was thought that kerosene-fueled missiles might remain in storage for years awaiting activation. This function was later transferred to solid-fuel rockets, though the high-temperature benefits of saturated hydrocarbons remained. Because of the low levels of alkenes and aromatics, RP-1 is less toxic than various jet and diesel fuels, and far less toxic than gasoline.

The more desirable isomers were selected or synthesized, with linear alkanes being reduced in number in favor of greater numbers of cyclic and highly branched alkanes. Just as cyclic and branched molecules improve octane rating in petrol, they also significantly increase thermal stability at high temperatures. The most desirable isomers are polycyclics such as ladderanes.

In contrast, the main applications of kerosene (aviation, heating, and lighting), are much less concerned with thermal breakdown and therefore do not require stringent optimisation of their isomers.

In production, these grades are processed tightly to remove impurities and side fractions. Ashes were feared likely to block fuel lines and engine passages, and wear away valves and turbopump bearings, as these are lubricated by the fuel. Slightly too-heavy or too-light fractions affected lubrication abilities and were likely to separate during storage and under load. The remaining hydrocarbons are at or near C12 mass. Because of the lack of light hydrocarbons, RP-1 has a high flash point and is less of a fire hazard than petrol.

All told, the final product is much more expensive than common kerosene. Any petroleum can produce RP-1 with enough refining, though real-world rocket-grade kerosene is sourced from a small number of oil fields with high-quality base stock, or it can be artificially synthesized. This, coupled with the relatively small demand in a niche market compared to other petroleum users, drives RP-1&#x27;s high price. Military specifications of RP-1 are covered in MIL-R-25576, and the chemical and physical properties of RP-1 are described in NISTIR 6646.

In Russia and other former Soviet countries, the two main rocket kerosene formulations are T-1 and RG-1. Densities are slightly higher, , compared to RP-1 at . 

The Soviets also discovered that even higher densities could be achieved by chilling the kerosene before loading it into the rocket&#x27;s fuel tanks, although this partially defeated the purpose of using kerosene over other super-chilled fuels. However, operationally, facilities were already in place to manage the vehicle&#x27;s cryogenic liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen, both of which are far colder than the kerosene. The launcher&#x27;s central kerosene tank is surrounded on four sides and the top by liquid oxygen tanks with a liquid nitrogen tank at the bottom. The kerosene tanks of the four boosters are relatively small and compact, also located between a liquid oxygen and a liquid nitrogen tank. Thus, once the kerosene was initially chilled, it would remain cold for the brief time needed to finish launch preparations. 

While the Soviets would eventually abandon chilling their kerosene, decades later SpaceX would revisit the idea for their Falcon 9 rocket. All versions since the Falcon 9 Full Thrust have used sub-cooled RP-1, chilled to , giving a density increase.

==Comparison with other fuels==

Chemically, a hydrocarbon propellant is less mass-efficient than hydrogen, although typically achieving a higher density and simpler handling than hydrogen.

For rocket engines, specific impulse () differs from other engines&#x27; (turbines&#x27; or pistons&#x27;) efficiencies: due to the rocket equation, efficiency is derived from exhaust velocity, not from total energy. As such, it can be beneficial to use &quot;less&quot; energy overall in exchange for lower-molecular-mass exhaust, meaning that chemical rocket engines achieve their peak efficiency at non-stoichiometric ratios. In particular, since the oxygen is heavier than the carbon or hydrogen, essentially all combustion rocket engines run fuel-rich to reduce the exhast molecular mass, increasing exhaust velocity and thus specific impulse (and as a side benefit, temperature and cooling are reduced too). This effect favors lighter elements like pure hydrogen. However, total thrust also matters, especially deep inside a gravity well, and the density of kerosene enables considerably higher power and thrust than hydrogen (relative to engine mass).

All told, due to higher energy-per-mass and lower molecular mass, hydrogen engines achieve , while kerosene engines generate an in the range of ; conversely, kerosene has the better handling, density, and thrust-to-weight properties. One common solution is to use a multistage rocket, where the first stage uses kerosene where thrust matters most, and the upper stages use hydrogen where specific impulse matters more. Examples of this dual-fuel architecture include the Saturn V moon rocket and the Atlas V workhorse.

Methane serves as a middle-ground between hydrogen and kerosene, offering middling molecular mass and efficiency, middling handling, middling coking/buildup properties, and density only slightly worse than kerosene. Since methane&#x27;s handling difficulties, while worse than kerosene, are about the same as liquid oxygen, that means a methlox rocket is nearly as easy to handle as a kerolox rocket, but with the improved efficiency and cleanliness (which remain worse than hydrogen). Furthermore, these balances in efficiency-vs-power makes methane more suitable for a single-fuel rocket, which have proven more economical than dual-fuel rockets (due to less complexity). As such, methalox has made a resurgence in popularity in 21st century rockets, at the expense of kerolox (better efficiency) and hydrolox (better handling). Examples include Starship, New Glenn, the first stage of Vulcan, and .

During engine shutdown, fuel flow goes to zero rapidly, while the engine is still quite hot. Residual and trapped fuel can polymerize or even carbonize at hot spots or in hot components. Even without hot spots, heavy fuels can create a petroleum residue, as can be seen in gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel tanks that have been in service for years. Rocket engines have cycle lifetimes measured in minutes or even seconds, preventing truly heavy deposits. However, rockets are much more sensitive to a deposit, as described above. Thus, kerosene systems generally entail more teardowns and overhauls, creating operations and labor expenses. This is a problem for expendable engines, as well as reusable ones, because engines must be ground-fired some number of times before launch. Even cold-flow tests, in which the propellants are not ignited, can leave residues.

On the upside, below a chamber pressure of about , kerosene can produce sooty deposits on the inside of the nozzle and chamber liner. This acts as a significant insulation layer and can reduce the heat flow into the wall by roughly a factor of two. Most modern hydrocarbon engines, however, run above this pressure, therefore this is not a significant effect for most engines.

Recent heavy-hydrocarbon engines have modified components and new operating cycles, in attempts to better manage leftover fuel, achieve a more-gradual cooldown, or both. This still leaves the problem of non-dissociated petroleum residue. Other new engines have tried to bypass the problem entirely, by switching to light hydrocarbons such as methane or propane gas. Both are volatiles, so engine residues simply evaporate. If necessary, solvents or other purgatives can be run through the engine to finish dispersion. The short-chain carbon backbone of propane (a C3 molecule) is very difficult to break; methane, with a single carbon atom (C1), is technically not a chain at all. The breakdown products of both molecules are also gases, with fewer problems due to phase separation, and much less likelihood of polymerization and deposition. However, methane (and to a lesser extent propane) reintroduces handling inconveniences that prompted kerosenes in the first place.

The low vapor pressure of kerosenes gives safety for ground crews. However, in flight the kerosene tank needs a separate pressurization system to replace fuel volume as it drains. Generally, this is a separate tank of liquid or high-pressure inert gas, such as nitrogen or helium. This adds extra cost and weight. Cryogenic or volatile propellants generally do not need a separate pressurant; instead, some propellant is expanded (often with engine heat) into low-density gas and routed back to its tank. A few highly volatile propellant designs do not even need the gas loop; some of the liquid automatically vaporizes to fill its own container. Some rockets use gas from a gas generator to pressurize the fuel tank; usually, this is exhaust from a turbopump. Although this saves the weight of a separate gas system, the loop now has to handle a hot, reactive gas instead of a cool, inert one.

Regardless of chemical constraints, RP-1 has supply constraints due to the very small size of the launch-vehicle industry versus other consumers of petroleum. While the material price of such a highly refined hydrocarbon is still less than many other rocket propellants, the number of RP-1 suppliers is limited. A few engines have attempted to use more standard, widely distributed petroleum products such as jet fuel or even diesel (for example, ABL Space Systems&#x27; E2 engine can run on either RP-1 or Jet-A). By using alternate or supplemental engine cooling methods, some engines can tolerate the non-optimal formulations.

Any hydrocarbon-based fuel produces more air pollution when burned than hydrogen alone. Hydrocarbon combustion produces carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, while hydrogen (H2) reacts with oxygen (O2) to produce only water (H2O), with some unreacted H2 also released. Both hydrocarbon-based fuels and hydrogen fuel will create oxides of nitrogen (NO&quot;x&quot;) pollutants, because rocket exhaust temperatures above will thermally combine some of the nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) already present in the atmosphere, to create oxides of nitrogen.

== RP-1-like fuels ==
Robert H. Goddard&#x27;s initial rockets used gasoline.

While the RP-1 specification was being developed, Rocketdyne was experimenting with diethyl cyclohexane. While superior to RP-1, it was never adopted for use its formulation was not finished before development of Atlas and Titan I (designed around RP-1) leading to RP-1 becoming the standard hydrocarbon rocket fuel.

Soviet formulations are discussed above. In addition, the Soviets briefly used syntin (), a higher-energy formulation, used in upper stages. Syntin is 1-methyl-1,2-dicyclopropyl cyclopropane (). Russia is also working to switch the Soyuz-2 from RP-1 to &quot;naftil&quot; or &quot;naphthyl&quot;.

After the RP-1 standard, RP-2 was developed. The primary difference is an even lower sulfur content. However, as most users accept RP-1, there was little incentive to produce and stock a second, even rarer and more expensive formulation.

The OTRAG group launched test vehicles using more common blends. In at least one instance, a rocket was propelled by diesel fuel. However, no OTRAG rocket came even close to orbit.

<text>Reach plc (known as Trinity Mirror between 1999 and 2018) is a British newspaper, magazine and digital publisher. It is one of the UK&#x27;s biggest newspaper groups, publishing 240 regional papers in addition to the national &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, &quot;The Sunday People&quot;, &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, &quot;Daily Star&quot;, &quot;Daily Star Sunday&quot; as well as the Scottish &quot;Daily Record&quot; and &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; and the magazine &quot;OK!&quot; Since purchasing Local World, it has gained 83 print publications. Reach plc&#x27;s headquarters are at the One Canada Square in London. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange.

==History==
The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; was launched by Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, &quot;for gentlewomen&quot; in 1903. The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange on 2 December 1953. In 1958 the International Publishing Company (IPC) acquired Mirror Group Newspapers, but IPC was in turn taken over by publishing giant Reed International in 1970. In 1984 Pergamon Holdings, a company owned by Robert Maxwell, acquired the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; from Reed International. The company was relisted as &quot;Mirror Group&quot; in 1991.

In 1991 the company was due to be investigated via an Anton Piller order for alleged theft of software from companies including Adobe Inc., Autodesk and Microsoft. The action was delayed as it coincided with Maxwell&#x27;s death, but was recommenced in 1992. Subsequently it was reported that &quot;At the Mirror Group, for instance, 700 out of the 800 software programs in use were found to be illegal&quot;.

The company bought Scottish &amp; Universal Newspapers in 1992, and in 1997 it acquired the Birmingham Post and Mail group of newspapers. In 1999 Trinity International Holdings, owners of the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;, merged with Mirror Group to form Trinity Mirror.

During 2005 the company introduced a number of measures to manage discretionary spending more carefully, some of which attracted press attention. 

In 2007, the company sought to sell a number of titles: the &quot;Reading Chronicle&quot; was sold to Berkshire Media Group and 25 Trinity Mirror South titles were sold to Northcliffe Media. On 1 October 2007 it was announced that the sale of the &quot;Racing Post&quot; had been completed: the entire sale process had raised £263 million.

In September 2008 the company announced that it would be closing the printing plant in Liverpool after 154 years of printing in the city, and transferring the work to Oldham. 

In February 2010, Trinity Mirror bought the regional M.E.N. Media and S&amp;B Media divisions of Guardian Media Group, containing 22 local titles across Northern England and in Surrey and Berkshire. This included the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; and &quot;Reading Evening Post&quot;. 

In March 2010 Trinity Mirror stated that it would end its bout of staff cuts and newspaper closures. The announcement came as the company reported pre-tax profits of £72.7m for 2009, exceeding analysts expectations.

In January 2012 it was announced Trinity Mirror acquired Communicator Corp, a digital communications company specialising in email and mobile communications for £8m. In August 2013, Trinity Mirror announced its partnership with whocanfixmycar.com, a portal connecting motorists nationwide with trusted local garages and mechanics.

In June 2014, Trinity Mirror transitioned its online bingo software from Dragonfish to Virtue Fusion from Playtech for its group of bingo brands.

In November 2015, Trinity Mirror purchased Local World, a major stakeholder in local news titles, from DMGT. Local World had been formed by former Trinity chief exec David Montgomery in 2012 to consolidate all DMGT&#x27;s local newspaper holdings other than the Metro, expanding their holdings while streamlining production, to make the group more saleable. Its 115 titles were formed primarily by those of Harmsworth&#x27;s historic Northcliffe Newspapers Group, alongside other smaller purchases made by DMGT and Local World subsequently, including the 2007 purchase from Trinity. The purchase increased Trinity Mirror&#x27;s local circulation by around 50%. The deal valued Local World at around £220 million.

In February 2018, the company completed the acquisition of the publishing assets of Northern &amp; Shell, including the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, &quot;Sunday Express&quot;, &quot;Daily Star&quot; (collectively the Express &amp; Star Group), and &quot;OK!&quot;. Following completion, Trinity Mirror announced a plan to rebrand as Reach, subject to investor approval at a meeting scheduled for May 2018. Following completion of the acquisition, the Competition and Markets Authority launched a preliminary investigation into the deal, requiring Trinity Mirror to keep Express Newspapers as a standalone entity.

In July 2020, Reach announced that it was cutting 550 jobs, 12% of its workforce, because of falling income amid reduced demand for advertising in its titles.

=== Phone hacking ===
In January 2011, former MP Paul Marsden announced that he was considering taking legal action against Trinity Mirror, over alleged phone hacking. On 24 September 2014, Trinity Mirror admitted that some of its journalists had been involved in phone hacking. It admitted liability and agreed to pay compensation to four people who had sued for the alleged hacking of voicemails (entertainer Shane Richie, soap actresses Shobna Gulati and Lucy Benjamin and BBC creative director Alan Yentob). The four also received an apology. Trinity Mirror also announced that it had earlier settled six other phone hacking claims in relation to former England football manager Sven-Göran Eriksson, footballer Garry Flitcroft, actor Christopher Eccleston, showbusiness agent Phil Dale, Richie&#x27;s wife Christine Roche and Abbie Gibson, a former nanny of David and Victoria Beckham. As of September 2014, a further 19 claims were registered at the High Court and another 10 claimants had indicated they would bring proceedings against Trinity Mirror. Other reports claimed that the number of victims could be much higher, with Evan Harris, associate director of the pressure group Hacked Off describing the revelations as: &quot;… just the tip of a very big iceberg&quot;. On 6 November 2014, Graham Johnson, pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court.

On 13 February 2015, Trinity Mirror published a public apology to &quot;all its victims of phone hacking&quot; on page two of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. It also set aside funds to cover the cost of settling phone hacking compensation payments. The same apology was printed in the following editions of the &quot;Sunday People&quot; and &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;.

A hearing at the High Court in London heard on 3 March 2015 that one Mirror group journalist had hacked the phones of some 100 celebrities every day and that 109 stories had been published about just seven claimants. On 21 May 2015, damages totalling nearly £1.25m were awarded to eight people as the result of phone hacking by Mirror Group journalists, including actress Sadie Frost (£260,000) and ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne (£188,250). Other damages recipients included soap opera actors Shane Richie (£155,000), Shobna Gulati (£117,500) and Lucy Benjamin (real name Lucy Taggart, £157,250), as well as BBC creative director Alan Yentob (£85,000), TV producer Robert Ashworth (former husband of Coronation Street actress Tracy Shaw, £201,250) and flight attendant Lauren Alcorn (former girlfriend of footballer Rio Ferdinand, £72,500). The Mirror Group said it would consider whether to seek permission to appeal against the size of the damages, but increased the money allocated to deal with phone hacking claims from £12 million to £28 million.

On , Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex was awarded £140,600 by the High Court in damages against Mirror Group Newspapers after 15 out of 33 sample articles in his claim against MGN were ruled as being the product of phone hacking or other unlawful information gathering.

==Operations==

===Newspapers===

Reach plc&#x27;s printing division, Reach Printing Services, is located at nine press sites throughout the UK, printing and distributing thirty-six major newspapers for the UK, including the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, the &quot;Sunday People&quot;, the &quot;Daily Record&quot; (in Scotland), and other contract titles including titles for the Guardian Media Group. Reach plc also owns a number of local titles in Northern England and in Surrey and Berkshire, after acquiring a number of titles from the Guardian Media Group in 2010.

===Digital===
In 2013, Trinity Mirror launched the content websites &quot;UsVsTh3m&quot; and &quot;Ampp3d&quot; on an experimental basis. &quot;UsVsTh3m&quot; was a website similar to BuzzFeed focused on quizzes and Flash games, edited by B3ta founder Rob Manuel and running the Tumblr platform. &quot;Ampp3d&quot; focused on data journalism and used the WordPress platform. Both websites were closed down in 2015.

<text>Thurl Arthur Ravenscroft (; February 6, 1914May 22, 2005) was an American actor and bass singer. He was well known as one of the booming voices behind Kellogg&#x27;s Frosted Flakes animated spokesman Tony the Tiger for more than five decades. He was also the uncredited vocalist for the song &quot;You&#x27;re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&quot; from the classic Christmas television special Dr. Seuss&#x27; &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot;

Ravenscroft did voice-over work and singing for Disney in various films and Disneyland attractions (which were later featured at Walt Disney World), the best known including The Haunted Mansion, Country Bear Jamboree, Mark Twain Riverboat, Pirates of the Caribbean, Disneyland Railroad, and Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room.

His voice-acting career began in 1939 and lasted until his death in 2005 at age 91.

==Early life and career==
Ravenscroft left his native Norfolk, Nebraska, in 1933 for California, where he studied at Otis Art Institute. In 1939, he joined a singing group formed by tenor Bill Days called The Sportsmen: Days, Johnny Rarig, Max Smith, and Ravenscroft. They served as backup singers to vocalist Marie Greene on the Okeh record label (credited as &quot;Marie Greene and Her Merry Men&quot;). The quartet also contributed to a Disney feature, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940), singing &quot;Honest John&quot;. This was deleted from the film, but can still be heard in the supplements on the 2009 DVD. 

The group, billed as The Four Merry Men, appeared in three-minute musical films, produced in 1941 by the Featurettes company, for coin-operated jukeboxes. That same year the Four Merry Men left Featurettes for the more successful Soundies company, and made more jukebox musicals; they were now billing themselves as &quot;The Four Sportsmen&quot;. They were also very popular on radio and in live nightclub appearances. 

In 1942, Thurl Ravenscroft left the Sportsmen quartet to serve in the armed forces. He served as a keeper navigator contracted to the U.S. Air Transport Command, spending five years flying courier missions across the north and south Atlantic. Among the notables carried on board his flights were Winston Churchill and Bob Hope. As he told an interviewer: &quot;I flew Winston Churchill to a conference in Algiers and flew Bob Hope to the troops a couple of times. So it was fun.&quot;

When he returned from the service, he found that his place in The Sportsmen had been taken by bass singer Gurney Bell, and Bell was unwilling to relinquish the job to Ravenscroft. Undaunted, Ravenscroft formed his own quartet, The Mellomen. The Mellomen contributed to other Disney films, such as &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;. The group appeared on camera in a few episodes of the Disney anthology television series; in one instance recording a canine chorus for &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; and in another as a barbershop quartet that reminds Walt Disney of the name of the young newspaper reporter &quot;Gallagher&quot;. Ravenscroft sang bass on Rosemary Clooney&#x27;s &quot;This Ole House&quot;, which went to No. 1 in both the United States and Britain in 1954, as well as Stuart Hamblen&#x27;s original version of that same song. He sang on the soundtrack for Ken Clark as &quot;Stewpot&quot; in &quot;South Pacific&quot;, one of the top-selling albums of the 1950s. He also backed The DeCastro Sisters on their 1955 top 20 hit, &quot;Boom Boom Boomerang.&quot; He sang &quot;King of the River,&quot; as the character Mike Fink, on a Golden Record released in 1956. Singing with the Johnny Mann Singers, his distinctive bass can also be heard as part of the chorus on 28 of their albums that were released during the 1960s and 1970s. He was also the bass singer on Bobby Vee&#x27;s 1960 Liberty hit record &quot;Devil or Angel&quot;. Andy Williams&#x27; recording of &quot;The 12 Days of Christmas&quot; features him as well. His work with Spike Jones included singing &quot;(I Was a) Teenage Brain Surgeon&quot; for the 1959 album &quot;Spike Jones in Stereo&quot;. 

He sang the opening songs for the two Disney serials used on &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, &quot;Boys of the Western Sea&quot; and &quot;The Hardy Boys: Mystery of the Applegate Treasure&quot;.

He sang the &quot;Twitterpatter Song&quot; and &quot;Thumper&#x27;s Song&quot; on the Disneyland record &quot;Peter Cottontail and other Funny Bunnies&quot;.

On the Disneyland record &quot;All About Dragons&quot;, he both provided the narration and sang the songs &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Loch Ness Monster&quot;.

His voice was heard during the Pirates of the Caribbean ride as well as The Haunted Mansion at Disneyland as Uncle Theodore, the lead vocalist of the singing busts in the cemetery near the end of the ride. He also played the Narrator in &quot;The Story and Song From the Haunted Mansion&quot;. Ravenscroft is also heard in the Enchanted Tiki Room as the voice of Fritz the Animatronics parrot, as well as the tree-like Tangaroa tiki god in the pre-show outside the attraction. He was also the voice of the Disneyland Railroad in the 1990s. Further roles include that of The First Mate on The Mark Twain Riverboat, a spokesalien for Tokyo Disneyland&#x27;s Pan Galactic Pizza Port restaurant, and the American bison head named Buff at The Country Bear Jamboree.

==Later career==
One of Ravenscroft&#x27;s best-known works is as the vocalist for the song &quot;You&#x27;re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&quot;. He was accidentally uncredited, leading the song to be misattributed to Boris Karloff and Tennessee Ernie Ford. The song, now credited to Ravenscroft, peaked on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 32 for the week ending January 2, 2021.

Ravenscroft sang &quot;No Dogs Allowed&quot; in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; animated motion picture &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot;.

For more than 50 years, he was the uncredited voice of Tony the Tiger for Kellogg&#x27;s Frosted Flakes. His booming bass gave the cereal&#x27;s tiger mascot a voice with the catchphrase &quot;They&#x27;re g-r-r-r-eat!!!!&quot;.

Various record companies, such as Abbott, Coral, Brunswick, and &quot;X&quot; (a division of RCA) also released singles by Ravenscroft, often in duets with little-known female vocalists, in an attempt to turn the bass-voiced veteran into a pop singer. These efforts were commercially unsuccessful, if often quite interesting. He was also teamed up with the Andrews Sisters (on the Dot Records album &quot;The Andrews Sisters Present&quot;) on the cover of Johnny Cymbal&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Bass Man&quot;. The Mellomen released some doo-wop records under the name Big John &amp; the Buzzards, a name apparently given to them by the rock-and-roll-hating Mitch Miller.

A devoted Christian, he appeared on many religious television shows such as &quot;The Hour of Power&quot;. In 1970, he recorded an album called &quot;Great Hymns in Story and Song&quot;, which featured him singing 10 hymns, each prefaced with the stories of how each hymn came to be, with the background vocals and instrumentals arranged and conducted by Ralph Carmichael.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Ravenscroft was narrator for the annual Pageant of the Masters art show at the Laguna Beach, California, Festival of the Arts.

==Later life and death==
Ravenscroft married June Seamans in 1946 and they had two children. June died in 1999. 

Ravenscroft died at his home on May 22, 2005, from prostate cancer, at the age of 91. He was buried at the Memorial Gardens at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California.

In the June 6, 2005, issue of the advertising industry journal &quot;Advertising Age&quot;, Kellogg&#x27;s ran an advertisement commemorating Ravenscroft, the headline reading: &quot;Behind every great character is an even greater man.&quot;

<text>Edward Kirk Herrmann (July 21, 1943 – December 31, 2014) was an American actor, director, and writer. He was known for his portrayals of Franklin D. Roosevelt in both the miniseries &quot;Eleanor and Franklin&quot; (1976) and 1982 film musical &quot;Annie&quot;, Richard Gilmore in Amy Sherman-Palladino&#x27;s comedy-drama series &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2000–2007), and a ubiquitous narrator for historical programs on The History Channel and in such PBS productions as &quot;Nova&quot;. He was also known as a spokesman for Dodge automobiles in the 1990s.

Herrmann started working in theatre on Broadway in 1972 with his debut in &quot;Moonchildren&quot; alongside James Woods. He received two Tony Award nominations, winning for Best Featured Actor in a Play for his performance in &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; in 1976. Herrmann received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning for his performance in &quot;The Practice&quot; in 1999. He also received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination with the ensemble for Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995). Herrmann became known as a character actor having appeared in various films such as Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Reds&quot; (1981), Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1985), Garry Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Overboard&quot; (1987), The Lost Boys (1987), Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004) and Chris Rock&#x27;s &quot;I Think I Love My Wife&quot; (2007).

==Early life==
Edward Kirk Herrmann was born on July 21, 1943, in Washington, D.C., the son of Jean Eleanor (née O&#x27;Connor) and John Anthony Herrmann. Of German and Irish descent, Herrmann grew up in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, and graduated from Bucknell University in 1965, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi. He studied acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art on a Fulbright Fellowship.

==Career==

===Theatre===
Herrmann began his career in theatre. One of the first professional productions he appeared in was the U.S. premiere of Michael Weller&#x27;s &quot;Moonchildren&quot; at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., in November 1971. He moved with the show to New York City to make his Broadway debut the following year. Herrmann returned to Broadway in 1976 to portray Frank Gardner in the revival of &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot;. For his performance he won a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play.

Herrmann and Dianne Wiest collaborated as directors on the Williamstown Theater Festival in its 1985 offering &quot;Not About Heroes&quot;, playing Sassoon. Frank Rich praised the performance: &quot;If Mr. Baker&#x27;s Wilfred is a bit of an uncomplicated, foursquare boy scout and if Mr. Herrmann&#x27;s stiff-upper-lipped Siegfried at first arouses deja vu, they form a passionate symbiosis as the darker clouds gather in Act II. Both actors also have a natural way with the rhetoric of their characters&#x27; respective canons.&quot; During 1988, Herrmann appeared in the New York production &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; as Gaius Cassius Longinus. Herrmann stated he had joined after becoming tired with constantly having to wear a suit in his prior roles and finding Cassius the most complex of the available roles. Frank Rich opined that Herrmann was the &quot;liveliest of the leads by far&quot; and that he would be better suited in the role of Brutus. In 1988–89, Herrmann starred with Alec Guinness in the London West End production of &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;. The play debuted at the Comedy Theater in November 1988, and was directed by Ronald Eyre. As the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Mr. Guinness and Mr. Herrmann share the stage uninterrupted for some two hours. The fictional play is rooted in the real-life relationship between a Soviet diplomat and an American negotiator who broke protocol in 1982 and made a private limited arms control deal while taking a stroll in a forest outside Geneva.&quot;

===Television===
==== 1970s ====

Herrmann was known for his portrayal of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the television films &quot;Eleanor and Franklin&quot; (1976) and &quot;Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years&quot; (1977) (both of which earned him Best Actor Emmy Award nominations), as well as in the first feature film adaptation of the Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot; (1982). Reflecting on becoming involved with &quot;Eleanor and Franklin&quot;, Herrmann reflected, &quot;It was a gift. You never get a script that good. Or a cast that good, or a director that good, or a designer that good, or a sponsor that good. And all on the same project? It was just blessed.&quot; Joseph McAuley said of Herrmann&#x27;s casting, &quot;To a generation growing up watching television and the movies, Edward Herrmann was the personification of FDR. As an actor, he stood head and shoulders above everybody else (literally—he was 6&#x27;5&quot;) and he was an inspired choice to play the Depression era/World War II president for a generation who never knew the real man who had long since become an historical figure.&quot; Emily VanDerWerff wrote that while she found &quot;Annie&quot; to be a mediocre film, &quot;Herrmann&#x27;s warm charm as FDR shines through. He&#x27;s a kind, compassionate fellow, in a film that&#x27;s all about the power of positive feeling and kindness.&quot;

==== 1980s ====
In 1980 Herrmann starred in an episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; as an army surgeon suffering from PTSD, and in 1987 he portrayed Grant Stayton III in &quot;Overboard&quot; and Max in &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;.
He was nominated for a Tony Award for &quot;Plenty&quot; in 1983 and Emmy Awards in 1986 and 1987 for two guest-starring appearances as Father Joseph McCabe on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;. In 1984, Herrmann played Alger Hiss in the PBS docudrama &quot;Concealed Enemies&quot;. During a break from filming, Herrmann praised the production: &quot;This is perhaps the most ambitious thing public television has ever done. They were a little nervous about it, because of the cost. But they shouldn&#x27;t have worried. It smacks of the real thing.&quot;

==== 1990s ====
Herrmann appeared in the 1994 television film &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot;. Ken Tucker wrote, &quot;In smaller roles, veteran character actors Austin Pendleton, Josef Sommer, and Edward Herrmann nail their lines like the seasoned pros they are.&quot; Herrmann portrayed Herman Munster in the Fox made-for-television film &quot;Here Come the Munsters&quot;, which aired on Halloween in 1995. Herrmann found the script &quot;silly and funny&quot; and wanted to play a clown again, though also admitting a lack of prior involvement with the original &quot;The Munsters&quot;: &quot;I was way too old. I was out of college. I was going to be an actor. I have always admired Fred, but no, I wasn&#x27;t swept up in Munstermania at all. I didn&#x27;t have a lunch box.&quot; In observing the plot of &quot;Here Come the Munsters&quot;, Herrmann was reminded of American family values, seeing the production as parodying such beliefs: &quot;In our screenplay, the Munsters arrive here as refugees. We resist attempts to kick us out of the country by a vicious politician who keeps saying, &#x27;America for Americans!&#x27;&quot;
David Flint and Nick Smithson positively commented on the accuracy of his likeness. He played Tobias Beecher&#x27;s father on &quot;Oz&quot;. Herrmann earned an Emmy in 1999 for his guest appearances on &quot;The Practice&quot;. Also in 1999, Herrmann appeared as President Fellwick in the television miniseries &quot;Atomic Train&quot;. Ray Richmond commented that Herrmann &quot;makes a swell U.S. President, reassuring and authoritative&quot;.

==== 2000s ====
For two episodes in 2007, Herrmann portrayed Norman, a strikingly old intern, on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. From 2000 to 2007, he portrayed Richard Gilmore on The WB&#x27;s &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said Herrmann had been the first choice to play the character and came in to read the script despite his agent saying he would not: &quot;We sat there in stunned silence as Ed opened the script and proceeded to read. And just like that, Richard Gilmore was sitting in front of us.&quot; The audition had taken place in New York City; casting director Jill Anthony said his audition and that of Kelly Bishop were vastly superior to others trying to procure the same roles. Bishop said she gained a friendship with Herrmann based on their similarities: &quot;We, obviously, were older [than the rest of the cast]. But we were also New York actors, and we connected very well. We always did our crossword puzzles together in the hair-and-makeup room.&quot; Alexis Bledel, who portrayed his character&#x27;s granddaughter, recalled Herrmann&#x27;s extensive knowledge and habits during breaks from filming: &quot;Ed was so knowledgeable about theater, TV, and film, and what I remember most is how he would share so much of this knowledge. He loved talking about it so we had those long Friday-night dinner scenes where we&#x27;d be sitting at a table all day, and he would share so much.&quot; Herrmann enjoyed the relationship between his character and that of Bledel, and was disappointed by the series finale. Caryn James assessed that Herrmann and Bishop succeeded in making their characters likeable while Sarah Schweppe wrote that Herrmann &quot;was such a comforting presence on this show.&quot;

==== 2010s ====
In October 2013, Herrmann made an appearance on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; in the episode &quot;Knight Vision&quot;, playing a minister.

Herrmann&#x27;s death was written in via his character Richard in the 2016 revival of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot;. Lauren Graham, Herrmann&#x27;s costar on &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, said, &quot;He would have loved this [new series]. His death was just a loss for us personally. It&#x27;s given the show a new complexity and depth. It&#x27;s a nice tribute to him.&quot; Sherman-Palladino told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s safe to say that the death of Richard Gilmore, the death of Ed Herrmann, looms large over everything.&quot; Scott Patterson, another costar, agreed with Sherman-Palladino: &quot;[Herrmann&#x27;s death] left a big void, but Amy honored it beautifully. He&#x27;s throughout ... these stories. It&#x27;s a wonderful homage to him as a person and to his character as well. It&#x27;s nice to have him around.&quot; After concluding filming, Bishop said of Herrmann, &quot;There was a space where he was supposed to be, so he certainly was with us, and he&#x27;s very prevalent in the show so that will make everybody happy I think, who&#x27;ll miss him, but I&#x27;m sorry he couldn&#x27;t be with us.&quot;

===Film===
Herrmann&#x27;s film career began in the mid-1970s, playing supporting roles including Robert Redford&#x27;s partner in &quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot;, a law student in &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;, the idle, piano-playing Klipspringer in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and opposite Laurence Olivier in &quot;The Betsy&quot; (1978). He again portrayed President Roosevelt in &quot;Annie&quot;.

Herrmann played the lead in the 1979 Kieth Merrill film, &quot;Take Down&quot;, in the role as the high-school English teacher turned wrestling coach. Among Herrmann&#x27;s better known roles are as the title character in another Kieth Merrill film, &quot;Harry&#x27;s War&quot; (1981), the philandering husband of Goldie Hawn&#x27;s character in &quot;Overboard&quot;, Reverend Michael Hill in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The North Avenue Irregulars&quot;, one of the characters in the film-within-a-film in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot;, and as Max, the mild-mannered head vampire in &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;. He played the corporate foil to Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin&#x27;s mismatched twins in their 1988 comedy &quot;Big Business&quot;. In 1993, Herrmann appeared in &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;. He was offered praise for the role, Vincent Canby citing him as one of the four actors heading &quot;the excellent supporting cast&quot;, and Malcolm Johnson writing Herrmann and Fred Dalton Thompson had the &quot;most convincing performances&quot;. Herrmann appeared in the following year&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Student&quot;, released on July 29, 1994. Kevin Thomas commented, &quot;Edward Herrmann, so often a fine actor, emerges as a caricature of the tweedy, pipe-smoking professor&quot;. Herrmann portrayed Nelson Rockefeller in the 1995 film &quot;Nixon&quot;. Herrmann appeared in the 1998 film &quot;Better Living&quot;, a priest who becomes a family counselor. Oliver Jones wrote that Herrmann was in &quot;a rare comic form&quot; in the role.

Herrmann also had a supporting role as William Randolph Hearst in the 2001 film &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Meow&quot;, starring Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies. A. O. Scott praised Herrmann as performing &quot;with remarkable emotional agility&quot; while Kevin Thomas noted the resemblance Herrmann had to Hearst as being better than some of his costars. Herrmann had a small role as Joseph Breen in the 2004 film &quot;The Aviator&quot;, being assessed by Rich Drees as joining several actors in making &quot;memorable moments&quot; and cited by Roger Friedman of joining other featured actors in creating &quot;lovely cameos&quot;. In March 2007, Herrmann had a supporting role in &quot;I Think I Love My Wife&quot;. Kirk Honeycutt lamented Herrmann, along with costars Chris Rock and Steve Buscemi, as character actors &quot;wasted on such lightweight roles.&quot;

In 2011, Herrmann appeared in &quot;Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star&quot;, playing a father whose son discovers his previous career. Robert Abele assessed Herrmann and costar Miriam Flynn as giving &quot;aw-shucks performances&quot;. In 2012, Herrmann appeared in &quot;Treasure Buddies&quot;, portraying the film&#x27;s antagonist. Herrmann took on the role due to the character being an English villain, allowing him to portray an antagonist with an accent, as well as being able to work with animals and make a film for children. The following year, Herrmann had a small role as a doctor in &quot;Are You Here&quot;. Herrmann&#x27;s final appearance in a film was &quot;The Town That Dreaded Sundown&quot;, released in October 2014. Gary Collinson wrote that Herrmann and Veronica Cartwright both offered &quot;solid support, although they are a little underused&quot;.

===Voice work===
Herrmann was known for his voluminous voice work for The History Channel and various PBS specials, including hosting a revival of Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;Why We Fight&quot;, and made appearances and did voiceovers in Dodge commercials from 1992 to 2001, and Rayovac batteries in the same timeframe. His voice work includes dozens of audiobooks, for which he won several Audie awards. He played Gutman in Blackstone Audio&#x27;s Grammy-nominated dramatization of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and played Cauchon in Blackstone&#x27;s audio version of Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot;. Herrmann provided the narration for the 2010 non-fiction book &quot;&quot; by Laura Hillenbrand, Josh Schwartz praising Herrmann as doing &quot;a great job&quot;, and Susan Rife assessing his narration as &quot;urgent&quot;.

After his well-received portrayal of J. Alden Weir in the play &quot;My Dearest Anna&quot; at the Wilton Playshop in Wilton, Connecticut, he was a special guest of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square in their Ring Christmas Bells holiday concert in Salt Lake City, Utah, December 11–14, 2008. He reprised his role of Franklin Roosevelt in 2014, providing the voice of F.D.R. in Ken Burns&#x27; PBS series, &quot;The Roosevelts: An Intimate History&quot;. Herrmann received praise, Neil Genzlinger noting him as among the &quot;top-drawer talent&quot; of the voiceover cast.

His final work was as narrator for another Burns documentary, &quot;Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies&quot;, which aired three months after Herrmann&#x27;s death. Director Barak Goodman recalled Herrmann collapsing during the first day of his work on the project and explaining his illness of terminal brain cancer to the production crew of the documentary, Goodman furthering that by this point it was clear to Herrmann that he was not going to live despite receiving new forms of treatment: &quot;He was confident he could do this, and felt it [was appropriate to] be his final project.&quot; Mary McNamara wrote that Herrmann delivered &quot;a final performance, equal in breathtaking courage and beauty, that embodies precisely what allows Goodman to explore the staggering numbers and many defeats without ever falling to its knees as defeatist.&quot;

==Personal life==
Herrmann came from a prominent Unitarian family, based in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. He became a Roman Catholic as an adult.

=== Marriages ===
Herrmann was married twice and had two daughters, Ryen and Emma. In 1978, he married his longtime girlfriend, screenwriter Leigh Curran. The marriage ended in 1992. Prior to his second marriage, Herrmann&#x27;s future second wife, Star (Hayner) Roman, filed a paternity suit against him after he fathered a child with her while filming &quot;Harry&#x27;s War&quot; (1981). Roman and Herrmann eventually married, and the union lasted from 1994 until his death in 2014. Herrmann had one stepson, Rory Herrmann (né Rory Roman), Star Roman&#x27;s son from a previous relationship who, as an adult, changed his last name from Roman to Herrmann in honor of his stepfather.

=== Automobiles ===
Herrmann was a well-known automotive enthusiast and restored classic automobiles. He was a regular master of ceremonies for the annual Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance and hosted the television show &quot;Automobiles&quot; on The History Channel. He owned and restored several classics of his own, including a 1929 Auburn 8-90 Boattail Speedster and a 1934 Alvis Speed 20.

===Legal issues===
In December 2014, it was reported that Edward and Star Herrmann had filed a lawsuit against their accountants seeking $14.5 million that they alleged had been misappropriated. The suit was later dismissed.

===Death===
On December 31, 2014, Herrmann died from brain cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, at the age of 71. The estate of Edward Herrmann has licensed his synthesized voice for audiobook narration through DeepZen.io from which the estate is granted royalties.

<doc id="383101" wikidata="Q800894" url="?curid=383101" title="Harajuku Station">
<text>is a railway station in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East). The station takes its name from the area on its eastern side, Harajuku.

==Lines==
This station is served by the circular Yamanote Line. It is also adjacent to Meiji-Jingumae Station on the Tokyo Metro Chiyoda and Fukutoshin Lines, and is marked as an interchange on most route maps, although there is no physical connection between the two stations.

==Station layout==
The station consists of a two side platforms serving two tracks. The station was initially an island platform with an additional temporary platform for the Shinjuku direction during major events only. The temporary platform was made permanent during the 2020 renovations, and the two platforms now serve different directions.

The main entrance is at the southern end of the station. A smaller entrance leading to the centre of the platform is convenient for Takeshita Street, a famous area in Harajuku.
To the north of the station there is a separate platform serving a loop on the east side of the freight line for use by the Imperial train. The platform has not been used since 2001, in part because the opening of the Shonan-Shinjuku Line has made it more difficult to schedule special charters on the Yamanote Line corridor (the most recent use of the official Imperial train, in 2008, was to and from Ueno Station). The points, signals and rails incidental to the platform are in disrepair, making it impossible to use the platform without some refurbishment.

===Platforms===

==History==

The station opened on 30 October 1906.

Platform edge doors were installed on the platforms in November 2014, and brought into operation from December.

Station numbering was introduced in 2016 with Harajuku being assigned station number JY19.

===2020 renovations===
In June 2016, JR East announced plans to rebuild the station ahead of the 2020 Olympics in order to alleviate overcrowding. A new station building was to be built by JR East at the station&#x27;s Meiji-Jingu entrance. A temporary platform used during busy periods will become the permanent platform for trains heading north through the station. The new station building and platform opened on 21 March 2020, in time for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. JR East decided in November 2019 to demolish the old station building at the Takeshita entrance on safety grounds after the Paralympics, and replace it with a safer structure constructed in a similar style.

In 2024, East Japan Railway Company (JR east) made an announcement that the original 1924 station building, which was the oldest wooden station building in Tokyo, will be returning as part of a new development project. The construction is set to run in 2026, with the opening of the commercial facility scheduled for the winter of that year.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the station was used by an average of 70,866 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the sixtieth-busiest station operated by JR East. The daily average passenger figures (boarding passengers only) in previous years are as shown below.

<text>The Church of God in Christ, Mennonite, also called Holdeman Mennonite, is a Christian Church of Anabaptist heritage. A man named John Holdeman (1832–1900), who was a baptized Mennonite, was instrumental in establishing the church in 1859. The Church of God in Christ, Mennonite is Conservative Mennonite and is different from other Conservative Mennonites because of its one true church doctrine. In 2021, the church had approximately 27,118 baptized members.

==History==

=== Origins ===

The congregations of the Church of God in Christ, Mennonite are descendants of the Anabaptists of the 16th century. Under the influential work of Menno Simons, many of the Anabaptists became known as Mennonites. Holdeman Mennonites recognize the faith of the Waldenses and other nonconformist groups of the Middle Ages as part of their spiritual heritage and see a direct lineage through them to the Early Church. They believe that &quot;Christ established one true, visible Church, and through her He has preserved His faith and doctrine through the ages.&quot;

=== John Holdeman ===

In the mid-19th century, some American Mennonites believed they saw in their church a spiritual decline and drift away from sound doctrine, and sought to &quot;earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints&quot;. Among these was John Holdeman (1832–1900), who was born in Wayne County, Ohio, to Mennonite parents. John&#x27;s father, Amos Holdeman, was interested in the revivalist movement of John Winebrenner, the Churches of God General Conference. John Holdeman became both an evangelist and a reformer. Issues he believed needed reform included the baptism of persons not giving sufficient evidence of conversion, less than diligent child training, and laxity of church discipline. Holdeman and other concerned individuals began holding separate meetings in April 1859, resulting in a permanent separation from the Mennonite church and the eventual organization of the &quot;Church of God in Christ, Mennonite&quot;. Holdeman wrote extensively and traveled widely, and new congregations were formed in the United States and Canada.

=== The coming of the Mennonites from Russia ===

The spread of the Church of God in Christ, Mennonite among other Mennonites and among the Amish was minimal until the arrival of Mennonite immigrants from the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine), so called &#x27;Russian&#x27; Mennonites who are of Dutch and Prussian heritage and who settled in Canada, mainly Manitoba and in the US, among other places in McPherson County, Kansas, starting in 1874. In 1878, Holdeman baptized 78 members of the McPherson County group. In 1881, he baptized 118 Kleine Gemeinde Mennonites in Manitoba who had migrated from southern Russia (now Ukraine) to North America some years before. With this group came Peter Toews, who led many Mennonite immigrants from Russia then living in Canada and Kansas into the Holdeman church.

== Theology ==

Holdeman&#x27;s teachings on salvation and the Bible probably reflect more evangelical Protestant and Pietist influence. The church began during a time of widespread revival and spiritual awakening. They hold the Arminian position and therefore believe that a person can lose his or her salvation if they stop following Jesus, termed the conditional preservation of the saints. Leaving or excommunication from the Holdeman Mennonite church is usually considered as following a loss of salvation. They do believe there are Christians saved outside of the Holdeman Mennonite church, but they also believe that the Church of God in Christ, Mennonite is the true visible church. Baptism, by pouring, is the method by which born-again believers are admitted into this visible church.

Soteriologically, the &quot;new birth&quot; is considered the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the doctrine of salvation. It is described as true repentance from sin and acceptance of the atoning work of Christ by faith, resulting in the redemption from sin and being spiritually born again. Those so affected will find their heart filled by God with peace, have assurance of salvation, and grace. This new birth results in one&#x27;s conversion from a sinful life unto a life that &quot;brings forth the fruit of the Holy Spirit.&quot;

In Christology, the Holdeman Church regarding the virgin birth of Jesus denies that Jesus was made from the flesh or seed of Mary and was a miraculous birth, trying to be closer to the teachings of Menno Simons and Melchior Hoffman than other modern Anabaptists. Eschatologically, they hold to an historic Anabaptist amillennial view of Christ&#x27;s kingdom and reign, teaching that the present dispensation is the only time in which salvation is offered.

The church and the world are viewed as distinctly separate institutions and thus Christians are not to be conformed to the world (). To maintain nonconformity to the world, Christians must not be &quot;compromised by worldly dress, amusements, or other worldly attractions.&quot; Worldly entertainment provided by such things as motion pictures, musical instruments, radio, television, and the improper use of the internet are to be avoided. Modesty in apparel is particularly stressed. Jewelry, &quot;costly or fashionable attire&quot;, and bodily ornamentation detract from Christian simplicity. Their beliefs also include an unwritten dress code. This dress code is most noticeable with the women, who wear mid-length dresses and head coverings.

Marriage is seen as divinely instituted between one man and one woman for life, for the propagation, purity, and happiness of the human race. It is only permitted between church members. Divorce and remarriage are not recognized, as among other plain Anabaptist churches.

== Practice ==

The church holds to a strong Mennonite culture, and obligates its members to lead a life according to Mennonite principles. The members should pattern their lives after their beliefs in integrity in personal and business dealings, non-involvement in government, loving their neighbors, keeping the avoidance of sin with love, inviting the sinner to repent, and emphasis on voluntary service. Non-resistance is standard practice, whether peacemaking among individuals, regarding lawsuits, or concerning warfare among nations. Holdeman Mennonites do not vote, serve in the military, or in law enforcement professions. They consider themselves to be citizens of a heavenly kingdom, not an earthly one.

=== Courtship ===
The Church of God in Christ Mennonite, via General Conference decision, has forbidden its members from pursuing &#x27;carnal courtship,&#x27; a term that encompasses any form of dating or courtship. Instead of allowing young people to choose a partner and engage in dating rituals, every congregation has a formal youth group, which organizes group functions such as bible studies, singing evenings, or volleyball games at which young people get to know each other. If a man wants to get married, he must get approval from a church minister who &quot;carries the proposal&quot; for him. In this tradition, the minister pays a visit to the young lady to whom the young man wants to propose. She can then accept or reject this proposal. In the event that she says yes, the marriage engagement will be announced in church the following Sunday morning after the worship service. Weddings are simple religious services followed by a reception for guests.

=== Membership ===

As with other Anabaptist churches, membership is through young child and adult believer’s baptism, by pouring water on the believer&#x27;s head. Communion is only for members and held with bread and unfermented grape juice rather than wine. Excommunication from the Holdeman Mennonite church is the only accepted way to leave it. There are cases of membership annulment but they are rare. The Holdeman Mennonites practice shunning or avoidance toward former members by not eating at the same table with them, shaking hands with them, or having any business partnerships with them.

=== Worship and service ===

Congregations meet weekly on Sunday mornings for Sunday school and worship. Each congregation has its own schedule for other types of meetings, such as communion, teaching, fellowship, Bible study, and singing. Foot washing is practiced by ministers washing the men&#x27;s feet, and the wives of ministers and/or deacons washing the women&#x27;s feet. The kiss of peace is also practiced.

Worship takes place in modest buildings that may contain air condition, carpet, and padded pews, but without any musical instruments. Singing is a cappella and in four-part harmony. Preaching tends to be topical, rather than exegetical. Most congregations also hold summer vacation Bible school classes during the summer school holidays. These are open to any children, member or non-member in their communities.

=== Clothing and appearance ===

Simplicity and modesty in clothing, personal possessions, and homes is held as an ideal. Plain dress is mandatory, which for women means a mid-length dress always with sleeves, and a head covering. The headcovering for daily use is black and sits on the back of the head. A second black headscarf is required to be over the head when attending church. Men do not wear a necktie in formal dress and otherwise their appearance resembles the look of a typical American businessman or other conservative Mennonites, in that they are dressed in a modest way that does not reveal much skin.

The men, &quot;by order of creation&quot; wear a beard out of &quot;respect for God’s order&quot;. Believing a devotional head covering is Scripturally commanded (1 Corinthians 11:1-16) as &quot;an outward sign of submission to God’s order,&quot; the women wear a devotional head covering &quot;for prayer and as a sign of submission.&quot;

=== Technology ===

Modern technologies like automobiles, telephone, and other modern conveniences are allowed. Television, radio, movies, musical instruments, and &quot;the improper use of the internet&quot; is not allowed. The Church of God in Christ Mennonite encourages members to install special software, purported to be a pornography filter, developed by the technology committee on any internet connected devices. This software blocks access to social media as well as many websites that church leadership finds objectionable. It can, if wanted, be set up so that if the app is disabled, a notification will be sent to a third party stating that the application is not active.

=== Ministers and church organization ===

Ministers are chosen from within the own ranks and formal training is not required. There are only two positions of office in the church and only men are eligible. Ministers and deacons from each congregation are chosen by the local membership by first asking a series of questions regarding a need for more staff, whether there is a gift for the position, and whether the members feel that it is the right time to elect a staff member. These questions are by show of hands and only if they all pass with a significant majority does a secret ballot vote take place. The vote is one ballot per member and there is no nomination process. The ballots are counted by the ministers already in office and, if a high enough percentage of the congregation votes for the same individual, he is elected. The percentages needed for a successful election or total number of votes cast for each candidate are not public knowledge. There are no salaried ministers and they seldom use prepared notes, but rather preach extemporaneously.

A General Conference made up of ministers, deacons, and other delegates meets every seven years (more often if necessary) for decision-making. An annual meeting is held yearly to provide a formal meeting for all business and corporate activities. The General Conference and Annual meeting is open to any members to attend. Matters at the General Conference are voted on by all members present. At each annual meeting a minister&#x27;s and deacon&#x27;s meeting is also held to discuss matters pertaining to spiritual life and practical issues and is sometimes, but not always a closed meeting to lay members.

=== Education ===

Formal education beyond eighth or ninth grade is rare outside of California and Quebec (to the tenth grade to comply with compulsory school attendance laws in these cases where religious exemption has not been made) and in the case of job training such as carpentry, nursing, etc. Congregations in Canada teach grades K-9. One thing that causes the Quebec government to give problems to these schools is that they teach Young Earth creationism in their science curriculum, and they use curriculum viewed as Bible-based.

Nearly all congregations have their own private schools. Those that cannot do this because of legal issues, run under a similar system: group homeschooling. 50-70% of their teachers are unmarried women aged eighteen and up. These teachers have some basic formal training in education, and their secondary education varies from completion of a high school curriculum through correspondence to no further education than what they received within their private schools. The main requirement to teach is a solid standing as a member in the Church and a reasonable skill set to be able to handle the grade that they will be teaching. This is determined in consultation with the applicant&#x27;s minister and local elected school board.

== Adherents and congregations ==

From a small beginning, membership grew to around 750 at the time of Holdeman&#x27;s death in the year 1900. In 1953 the baptized membership was 5,308, in 41 congregations in Canada and the US. There were missions in Mexico and New Mexico with three ordained ministers of Spanish language, and also a mission station in Canada among indigenous peoples. The church experienced slow but steady growth until the mid-1970s. During the later 1970s the growth slowed, then continued. Numerous new churches have been started because of the growth as members have sought opportunity in new locations, and churches have been planted in new states and provinces.

In 2009, there were 14,672 members and 138 congregations in the US. According to the 2010 US census, there were 153 congregations in the US. In 2021, the church had 27,118 members, of whom 16,132 lived in the US and 5,396 in Canada.

Kansas continues to contain the largest population of the denomination, with over 4,000 members. Current membership still greatly reflects the growth of the church through the Swiss-German ancestry of those such as Holdeman, the Kansas-&quot;Russian Mennonite&quot; ancestry, and the Manitoba-&quot;Russian Mennonite&quot; ancestry. Yet, in some regions, like Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Eastern Ontario, there is a high percentage of believers who have recently joined the Church and do not have the same roots as the majority of the Holdemans in North America, who are still ethnic Mennonites.

In addition to the US and Canada, the Church of God has established congregations and mission work in various countries in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Europe.

== Controversies ==

=== 2016 lawsuit and allegations ===
In February 2016, a lawsuit was filed against the Mennonite church with the plaintiff alleging that he was sexually assaulted by his father from age 11. The lawsuit alleged that clergy failed to contact authorities as required by mandatory reporter statutes. His lawsuit pointed allegations of sexual abuse by people who attended congregations affiliated with the Church of God In Christ Mennonite, some resulting arrests and convictions. The case was settled out of court, and the terms of the settlement were not published by the parties.

=== 2022 allegations by Mennonite Abuse Prevention List ===
On August 2, 2022, a nonprofit called Mennonite Abuse Prevention published a report alleging how sexual abuse allegations are handled in the church. This report alleges, in a series of cases, that there was clergy misconduct including failures to report abuse and cases where victims were discouraged from reporting abuse to police. The allegations claim that, as part of the settlement of the 2016 lawsuit, every congregation explored local mandatory reporting laws and declared that their congregations would now comply. The allegations further claim that, that same year, court records show that ministers at the Gospel Mennonite Church congregation in Almena, Wisconsin were notified that Leslie Toews, a member at the congregation, had sexually abused a 13-year-old girl for about a year, and claim that this abuse was not reported. The allegations claim that the alleged perpetrator arranged to speak with detectives four years later, in 2021. MAP claims that church policy documents shared with them show that church members, including school teachers, are required by law to report directly to authorities, are required to report abuse to clergy, who then investigate and make a judgement call with regard to whether the abuse should be reported to authorities.

=== The purge of the 1970s (The New Way) ===
Economic trends in the 1970s led to an increasing rate of non compliant members, in addition to some members who began to question the doctrine of the &quot;one true church.&quot; Church discipline concerns led to a &quot;new way&quot; of dealing with non-conforming members. Church leadership began the process of interviewing every member of every congregation around the conference. This new method was referred to as &quot;paneling&quot;, which led to number of members who were disciplined and excommunicated. The practice of excommunicating former members, known as The Avoidance, is still practiced and is an official Conference Decision (policy).

== Publications ==

The &quot;Messenger of Truth&quot;, which was begun in the early 20th century, is issued bi-weekly from the church headquarters in Moundridge, Kansas, US. Canadian offices are located in Greenland, Manitoba. The church&#x27;s publishing arm is Gospel Publishers.

<doc id="383111" wikidata="Q801447" url="?curid=383111" title="Shinjuku Station">
<text>is a major railway station in Tokyo, Japan, that serves as the main connecting hub for rail traffic between central/eastern Tokyo (the special wards) and Western Tokyo on the inter-city rail, commuter rail, and subway lines. The station straddles the boundary between the Shinjuku and Shibuya special wards. In Shinjuku, it is in the Nishi-Shinjuku and Shinjuku districts; in Shibuya, it is in the Yoyogi and Sendagaya districts.

The station was used by an average of 3.59 million people per day in 2018, making it the world&#x27;s busiest railway station by far (and registered as such with Guinness World Records). The main East Japan Railway Company (JR East) station and the directly adjacent private railways have a total of 35 platforms, an underground arcade, above-ground arcade and numerous hallways with another 17 platforms (53 total) that can be accessed through hallways to five directly connected stations without surfacing outside. The entire above/underground complex has well over 200 exits.

== History ==

Shinjuku Station opened in 1885 as a stop on Japan Railway&#x27;s Akabane-Shinagawa line (now part of the Yamanote Line). Shinjuku was still a quiet community at the time and the station was not heavily trafficked at first. The opening of the Chūō Line (1889), Keiō Line (1915) and Odakyū Line (1923) led to increased traffic through the station.

Japanese government urban planner Kensaburo Kondo designed a major revamp of the station in 1933, which included a large public square on the west side completed in 1941. Kondo&#x27;s plan also called for extending the Tokyu Toyoko Line to a new underground terminal on the west side of the station and constructing an east–west underground line that would be served by the Seibu Railway and the Tokyo Kosoku Railway (forerunner of Tokyo Metro), while the Keio and Odakyu lines would use above-ground terminals to the west of the JR station. These plans were suspended upon the onset of World War II but influenced the current layout of the station area. Subway service ultimately began in 1959.
The Seibu Shinjuku Line was extended from Takadanobaba Station to Seibu Shinjuku Station in 1952. Seibu Shinjuku was built as a temporary station pending a planned redevelopment of the east side of Shinjuku Station, which was to feature a large station building that would house a new Seibu terminal on its second floor. Seibu abandoned its plan to use the building due to a lack of space for trains longer than six cars; the building is now known as Lumine Est and retains some design features originally intended to accommodate the Seibu terminal (in particular, a very high ceiling on the first floor and a very low ceiling on the second floor). In the late 1980s, Seibu planned to build an underground terminal on the east side of Shinjuku but indefinitely postponed the plan in 1995 due to costs and declining passenger growth.

On 8 August 1967, a freight train carrying jet fuel bound for the U.S. air bases at Tachikawa and Yokota collided with another freight train and caught fire on the Chūō Rapid tracks. The incident stoked ongoing political controversy in Japan regarding the Vietnam War. The station was a major site for student protests in 1968 and 1969, the height of civil unrest in postwar Japan. On 21 October 1968, 290,000 marchers participated in International Anti-War Day, taking over Shinjuku station and forcing trains to stop. In May and June 1969, members of the antiwar group Beheiren carrying guitars and calling themselves &quot;folk guerrillas&quot; led weekly singalongs in the underground plaza outside the west exit of the station, attracting crowds of thousands. Participants described it as a &quot;liberated zone&quot; and a &quot;community of encounter.&quot; In July, riot police cleared the plaza with tear gas and changed signs in the station to read &quot;West Exit Concourse&quot; instead of &quot;West Exit Plaza.&quot; The incident represented a significant defeat for public activism in Tokyo.

There have been plans at various points in history to connect Shinjuku to the Shinkansen network, and the 1973 Shinkansen Basic Plan, still in force, specifies that the station should be the southern terminus of the Jōetsu Shinkansen line to Niigata. While construction of the Ōmiya-Shinjuku link never started and the Jōetsu line presently terminates in Tokyo Station, the right of way, including an area underneath the station, remains reserved.

On 5 May 1995, the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult attempted a chemical terrorist attack by setting off a cyanide gas device in a toilet in the underground concourse, barely a month after the gas attack on the Tokyo subway which killed 13, left 6,252 people with non-fatal injuries, severely injured 50 people, and caused 984 cases of temporary vision problems. This time the attack was thwarted by staff who extinguished the burning device.

The station facilities on the Marunouchi Line were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

Station numbering was introduced to the Odakyu terminal in 2014 with Shinjuku being assigned station number OH01.

A major expansion of the JR terminal was completed in April 2016, adding a 32-story office tower, bus terminal, taxi terminal, and numerous shops and restaurants.

Station numbering was introduced to the JR East platforms in 2016 with Shinjuku being assigned station numbers JB10 for the Chūō-Sobu line, JS20 for the Shonan-Shinjuku line, JA11 for the Saikyō line, JC05 for the Chuo line rapid, and JY17 for the Yamanote line. At the same time, JR East assigned the station a 3-letter code to its major transfer stations; Shinjuku was assigned the code &quot;SJK&quot;.

In 2020, the east–west free passageway was opened, shortening the time required for pedestrians to pass between the east and west exits by 10 minutes. A major redevelopment of the station and the surrounding area began in July 2021 with the aim of improving pedestrian flow and making it easier and faster to cut through the east and west sides of the station. Construction is expected to continue until 2047.

When the Keio Line extended to Shinjuku in 1915, its terminal was located several blocks east of the government railway (presently JR) station. The terminal was first named and was on the street near the Isetan department store. In 1927, the station was moved from the street to a newly built terminal adjacent to the original station. The station building housed a department store. The station name was changed to in 1930 and again to in 1937.

The tracks from the terminal were on the Kōshū Kaidō highway, which crosses the Yamanote Line and the Chūō Line in front of the south entrance of Shinjuku Station by a bridge. The Keiō Line had a station for access to Shinjuku Station, named and renamed in 1937 .

In July 1945, the terminal of the Keiō Line was relocated to the present location, though on the ground level, on the west side of Shinjuku Station. Keiō Shinjuku Station and Shōsen Shinjuku Ekimae Station were closed. This was because the trains faced difficulty in climbing up the slopes of the bridge over the governmental railway after one of the nearby transformer substations was destroyed by an air raid. The site of Keiō Shinjuku Station near Shinjuku-Sanchōme subway station is now occupied by two buildings owned by Keiō: Keiō Shinjuku Sanchōme Building and Keiō Shinjuku Oiwake Building.

==Lines==
Shinjuku is served by the following railway systems:
** Chūō Main Line (Limited Express)
** Chūō Line (Rapid)
** Chūō–Sōbu Line
** Saikyō Line
** Shōnan–Shinjuku Line
** Yamanote Line

==Station facilities==

===JR East===
The station is centered around facilities servicing the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) lines. These consist of eight ground-level island platforms (16 tracks) on a north–south axis, connected by two overhead and two underground concourses. Most JR services here are urban and suburban mass transit lines, although many limited express services to Kōfu and Matsumoto on the Chūō Main Line and to Nikkō and Kinugawa Onsen via joint operations with the private Tōbu Railway also begin and end at this station, including &quot;Narita Express&quot; services to and from Narita International Airport. The JR section alone handles an average of 1.5 million passengers a day.













===Odakyu===
The terminus for the private Odakyu Odawara Line is parallel to the JR platforms on the west side and handles an average of 490,000 passengers daily. This is a major commuter route stretching southwest through the suburbs and out towards the coastal city of Odawara and the mountains of Hakone. The ten platforms are built on two levels beneath the Odakyu department store; three express service tracks (six platforms) on the ground level and two tracks (four platforms) on the level below. Each track has platforms on both sides in order to completely separate boarding and alighting passengers.

Chest-high platform screen doors were added to platforms 4 and 5 in September 2012.

====Ground level====


====Underground level====


===Keio/Toei Subway (Toei Shinjuku Line)===
Keio operates two sections of Shinjuku Station, the traditional Keio Line stub terminal and a separate through station connecting the Keio New Line with the Toei Shinjuku Line. In 2019, 788,567 passengers used the Keio complex daily (Keio and Keio New Lines), which makes it among the busiest among the non-JR Group railways of Japan.

==== Keio Line ====
The Keio Line concourse is located to the west of the Odakyu line concourse, two floors below ground level under the Keio department store. It consists of three platforms stretching north to south. An additional thin platform between Platforms 2 and 3 is used for alighting only. This suburban commuter line links Shinjuku to the city of Hachiōji to the west. Chest-high platform edge doors were introduced on the Keio Line platforms in March 2014. The doors are different colours for each platform; the doors on Platform 2 are green.



====Keio New Line and Toei Shinjuku Line====
The shared facilities for the Toei Shinjuku subway line and the Keiō New Line are distinctively called and consist of two platforms stretching east–west five floors beneath the Kōshū Kaidō avenue to the southwest of the JR section. The concourse is managed by Keio Corporation but is in a separate location from the main Keio platforms. Further south (and deeper underground) are the two north-to-south Toei Ōedo subway line platforms.


===Toei Subway (Toei Oedo Line)===
Toei Ōedo Line&#x27;s two underground platforms stretch north–south to the south of the Toei Shinjuku Line and Keio New Line facilities. This is on the 7th basement floor of Tokyo prefectural road 414(Yotsuya-Tsunohazu Ave.).


===Tokyo Metro===
Tokyo Metro&#x27;s two Marunouchi Line underground platforms stretch east–west to the north of the JR and Odakyu facilities, directly below the Metro Promenade underground mall.


===Commercial facilities===
Many department stores and shopping malls are built directly into the station, some operated by the railroads. These include:
*Lumine Est – above JR&#x27;s east exit
*Odakyu department store – above the Odakyu line concourse (Closed down in October 2022.)
*Odakyu Mylord – above the southern end of the Odakyu line concourse
*Lumine 1 shopping mall – above the Keio Line concourse
*Lumine 2 shopping mall – above JR&#x27;s south and Lumine exits
*Keio Department store – above the Keio Line concourse
*Keio Mall – underground mall to the southwest of the Keio Line concourse
*Odakyu Ace – underground malls beneath the bus terminal by the west exit.

In addition to the above, the Metro Promenade, which is an underground mall owned by Tokyo Metro, extends eastwards from the station beneath Shinjuku-dori avenue, all the way to the adjacent Shinjuku-sanchōme station with 60 exits along the way. The Metro Promenade in turn connects to Shinjuku Subnade, another underground shopping mall, which leads onto Seibu Railway&#x27;s Seibu-Shinjuku station.

Shinjuku Station is connected by underground passageways and shopping malls to
*Nishi-shinjuku Station (Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line)
*Seibu-Shinjuku Station (Seibu Shinjuku Line)
*Shinjuku-nishiguchi Station (Toei Ōedo Line)
*Shinjuku-sanchōme Station (Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line, Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line, and Toei Shinjuku Line)
*Tochōmae Station (Toei Ōedo Line)

Nearby non-connected stations (within 500 meters of an underground passageway or station) include
*Shinjuku-gyoemmae Station
*Yoyogi Station
*Higashi-shinjuku Station
*Okubo Station
*Shin-Okubo Station
*Minami-Shinjuku Station

===Bus terminals===
There is a bus terminal at the west exit servicing both local and long-distance buses and a JR Highway Bus terminal at the New South Gates.

On April 4, 2016, the new bus terminal and commercial facilities nearby the south exit, named (Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal), opened for service. Considerable numbers of coaches and airport buses depart from this new terminal.

==Passenger statistics==
The figures below are the official number of passengers entering and exiting (except for JR East) each day released by each train operator. The figure for JR East only includes entering passengers.

Average number of passengers per day by fiscal year for the JR East station (1913–1935)

== Cultural references ==

The station and other parts of the Toei Ōedo Line are referenced in the Digimon Adventure franchise. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall (who spent ten years living in Tokyo as an artist) depicted the station area in his large oil painting &quot;Shinjuku&quot;, exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in London in 2013.

<text>Wolf Rüdiger Hess (&quot;Heß&quot; in German script; 18 November 1937 – 24 October 2001) was a German architect, the only son of Rudolf Hess and Ilse Hess (née Pröhl).

==Early life==
Born in Munich, Hess lived with his parents until his father&#x27;s flight to Scotland on 14 May 1941. After that, his father was denounced by the Nazi government as &quot;mentally ill&quot;, and this led his mother to leave Munich and take her son to live at the family&#x27;s house in the country, at Bad Oberdorf, a small spa village in the Allgäu Alps. There, young Wolf Rüdiger gained the lifelong nickname of &quot;Buz&quot;. On 3 June 1947, Hess&#x27;s mother was arrested by Allied forces, together with all the wives of the other Germans convicted at Nuremberg, and she was interned at Augsburg-Göggingen camp. Hess then lived with an aunt until his mother&#x27;s release in March 1948. He began to attend a local high school in 1947 and then from the mid-1950s studied architecture, qualifying as an architect in 1961.

==Campaigns==
Hess gained prominence for criticising an investigation into his father&#x27;s alleged suicide while serving a life sentence in Spandau Prison in Berlin. Hess maintained that the investigation was a cover-up, and that the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) had murdered him. He believed that they had done this to prevent his father&#x27;s parole – which he believed to be imminent – because the British government was afraid that he would reveal embarrassing information about British actions during World War II. Wolf Rüdiger Hess and his father&#x27;s lawyer, Alfred Seidl, arranged their own autopsy.

Hess wrote three books: My Father Rudolf Hess (1986), Who Murdered My Father, Rudolf Hess? (1989) and Rudolf Hess: I regret nothing (1994/1998). Hess was head of the &quot;Rudolf-Heß-Gesellschaft e.V.&quot; before his death.

At the age of 63, Wolf Rüdiger Hess suffered a stroke and was taken to a Munich hospital, where he died. He left a widow and three children.

<doc id="383114" wikidata="Q56575424" url="?curid=383114" title="Quadroon">
<text>In the colonial societies of the Americas and Australia, a quadroon or quarteron (in the United Kingdom, the term quarter-caste is used) was a person with one-quarter African/Aboriginal and three-quarters European ancestry. Similar classifications were octoroon for one-eighth black (Latin root &quot;octo-&quot;, means &quot;eight&quot;) and quintroon for one-sixteenth black.

Governments of the time sometimes incorporated the terms in law, defining rights and restrictions. The use of such terminology is a characteristic of hypodescent, which is the practice within a society of assigning children of mixed unions to the ethnic group which the dominant group perceives as being subordinate. The racial designations refer specifically to the number of full-blooded African ancestors or equivalent, emphasizing the quantitative least, with quadroon signifying that a person has one-quarter black ancestry.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;quadroon&quot; was borrowed from the French &quot;quarteron&quot; and the Spanish &quot;cuarterón&quot;, both of which have their root in the Latin &quot;quartus&quot;, meaning &quot;a quarter&quot;.

Similarly, the Spanish cognate &quot;cuarterón&quot; is used to describe &quot;cuarterón de mulato&quot; or &quot;morisco&quot; (someone whose racial origin is three-quarters white and one-quarter black) and &quot;cuarterón de mestizo&quot; or &quot;castizo&quot;, (someone whose racial origin is three-quarters white and one-quarter Amerindian), especially in Caribbean South America.

==Racial classifications==
Quadroon was used to designate a person of one-quarter African/Aboriginal ancestry, that is equivalent to one biracial parent (African/Aboriginal and Caucasian) and one white or European parent; in other words, the equivalent of one African/Aboriginal grandparent and three White or European grandparents. In some countries in Latin America, which had a variety of terms for racial groups, some terms for quadroons were &quot;morisco&quot; or &quot;chino&quot;, see &quot;casta&quot;. &quot;Terceroon&quot; was a term synonymous with quadroon, derived from being three generations of descent from an African ancestor, counting the ancestor as the first generation.

The term &quot;mulatto&quot; was used to designate a person who was biracial, with one fully black parent and one fully white parent, or a person whose parents are both mulatto. In some cases, it was used as a general term, for instance on U.S. census classifications, to refer to all persons of mixed race, without regard for proportion of ancestries. The only time a more specific classification was utilized was in the 1890 Census, which counted almost a million mulattoes (defined as to white), over 100,000 quadroons and slightly under 70,000 octaroons among 7,5 million Black people; however, the Census Bureau concluded from the experience that this kind of distinction is unreliable and &quot;of little value&quot; so it was abandoned.

The term octoroon referred to a person with one-eighth African/Aboriginal ancestry; that is, someone with family heritage equivalent to one biracial grandparent; in other words, one African great-grandparent and seven European great-grandparents. An example was Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. Octoroon was applied to a limited extent in Australia for those of one-eighth Aboriginal ancestry, as the government implemented assimilation policies on the Stolen Generations. The term mustee was also used to refer to a person with one-eighth African ancestry. 

The term &quot;sacatra&quot; was used to refer to one who was seven-eighths black or African and one-eighth white or European (i.e. an individual with one black and one griffe parent, or one white great-grandparent).

The term &quot;mustefino&quot; refers to a person with one-sixteenth African ancestry. The terms quintroon or &quot;hexadecaroon&quot; were also used.

In the French Antilles, the following terms were used during the 18th century:
In some countries in Latin America, the terms griffe or sambo were sometimes used for an individual of three-quarters black parentage, i.e. the child of a mulatto parent and a fully black parent.

==Depiction in media==

In the period before the American Civil War, mixed-race slaves with predominantly white features were depicted in photos and other media to show whites that some slaves were visually indistinguishable from themselves, thus preventing them from seeing slaves as an ethnic &quot;other&quot;, in order to further the abolition movement.
