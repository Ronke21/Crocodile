<text>Gordon Onslow Ford (26 December 1912 – 9 November 2003) was one of the last surviving members of the 1930s Paris surrealist group surrounding André Breton.

Born in the English town of Wendover in 1912 to a family of artists, Onslow Ford began painting at an early age. His grandfather, Edward Onslow Ford, was a Victorian sculptor. At the age of 11, he began painting landscapes under the guidance of his uncle. Following the death of his father at age 14, he was sent to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. The ocean affected him deeply and his early works depicted ocean scenes. The metaphor of taking a &quot;voyage&quot; later became an important aspect of his paintings.

==Paris==

While in the Navy, Onslow Ford visited Paris several times. In 1937, he resigned as a naval officer and moved to Paris to pursue painting full-time. He studied with André L’hote for five weeks and studied with Fernand Léger for a short time. He continued visiting Léger, bringing his work to him often for critique.

Soon he met the Chilean architect Roberto Matta. Matta, who was working with Le Corbusier, was an accomplished draftsman and was making small drawings on the side. Onslow Ford, with his keen sense of seeing, admired Matta&#x27;s drawings as &quot;the most exciting images&quot; he had seen in Paris. He encouraged Matta to continue with his drawings, which eventually inspired Matta to shift his direction from architecture to painting.

Onslow Ford and Matta became close friends, meeting and traveling frequently. They developed an ongoing dialogue about their ideas on art and metaphysics. They were also inspired by the 1937 exhibit of Mathematical Objects in Paris in which one aspect of the Mathematical Object was visible while another aspect was left to the imagination of the viewer.

In 1938, André Breton invited Onslow Ford to join the surrealist group in Paris and attend their meetings in Café deux Magots. Onslow Ford then became friends with Pierre Mabille, André Breton, Yves Tanguy, Esteban Frances, Wolfgang Paalen, Max Ernst and Victor Brauner among others. His love of painting also led him to collect paintings and frequently visit the studios of Picasso, Miró, de Chirico and André Masson.

In the summer of 1939, Onslow Ford rented a chateau at Chemilleu near the border of Switzerland, and invited several of his friends to stay for a couple of months. Among the friends were André Breton, Jacqueline Lamba, Yves Tanguy, Roberto Matta, Esteban Frances, and Kay Sage. They spent the summer painting, exchanging ideas and reading poetry. They were visited regularly by their friend and neighbor Gertrude Stein.

==New York City==

At the outset of World War II, the Society for the Preservation of European Culture invited Onslow Ford to join the surrealists in New York. Onslow Ford, one of the few surrealists who was an English speaker, was invited to give a series of lectures at the New School for Social Research and organized four important surrealist shows in 1941. Those lectures and exhibitions are said to have influenced artists such as Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, and others who would go on to create Abstract Expressionism.

==Mexico==

Onslow Ford met the American writer Jacqueline Johnson at his lectures in New York and they married in 1941. That same year, they moved to Mexico where he had previously visited his surrealist friends Wolfgang Paalen, Remedios Varo and Esteban Frances who were all living there.

For six years (1941–1947) Onslow Ford and Johnson lived in Erongaricuaro, a remote village populated by the Purépecha Indians and located on the shores of Lake Patzcuaro. While living there, they created, studied, and learned the native way of living and participated in some native ceremonies. They stayed in constant connection with Wolfgang Paalen with Johnson assisting Paalen in editing his journal DYN as well as contributing writings for the journal. During their stay they were also visited by many Surrealist friends including Roberto Matta, Wolfgang Paalen, Remedios Varo, Esteban Frances, Eva Sulzer, Alice Rahon, William Fett, Pierre Mabille, Benjamin Péret, and the poet César Moro.

==San Francisco==

In 1947, Onslow Ford and Johnson moved to California, choosing the San Francisco Bay Area as the fertile soil where their new ideas would have a chance to grow. While in San Francisco, he was invited to give a retrospective show at the San Francisco Museum of Art (1948). The title of the exhibit and the catalogue, &quot;Towards a New Subject in Painting&quot;, spoke to the fact that he was moving in a new direction in his art.

While living in San Francisco, Onslow Ford met the Greek poet Jean Varda and together they acquired the ferryboat &quot;Vallejo&quot;, which they docked in Sausalito and converted into their studios. For many years the ferryboat was an inspiring haven for painters and artists and became a small cultural center on the waterfront. In 1951, Onslow Ford with his friends Wolfgang Paalen, Lee Mullican, and Jacqueline Johnson created an exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Art called &quot;Dynaton&quot;.

In the early 1950s, Onslow Ford was introduced to Asian philosophy and studied Hinduism with Haridas Chaudhuri and Buddhist scholar Alan Watts at the newly formed Asian Academy (now called the California Institute of Integral Studies) in San Francisco. Around this time he also met the venerable Zen master Hodo Tobase of the Soto Zen sect and began studying Chinese calligraphy (1952–57). This entrance into Asian thought and practice had a profound influence on his paintings. Buddhist teachings of the Void and Emptiness as well as the practice of calligraphy initiated him into an exploration of the depths of the Mind and its images.

==Inverness==

In 1957, Onslow Ford and Johnson acquired a large body of virgin woodlands in the hills of Inverness, California. Ten years later they gave the majority of the land to the Nature Conservancy for the sake of preserving it. At this time, Onslow Ford began writing and, in 1964, he published his first book entitled &quot;Painting in the Instant&quot;. Johnson died in 1976 as he was working on his second book, &quot;Creation&quot;, which was published in 1978. In 1977, he had a major retrospective of his work at the Oakland Museum of California. After this, he assumed a more solitary life, focusing more deeply on his painting.

In 1989, he met Fariba Bogzaran, an artist, lucid dream researcher, and faculty member at John F. Kennedy University. They began a series of dialogues on arts and consciousness. In her research, Bogzaran found a connection between Onslow Ford&#x27;s paintings, lucid dreaming, and meditation. Onslow Ford collaborated with her on several of his books including &quot;Insights&quot; (1991), &quot;Ecomorphology&quot; (1994) and &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (1999).

In 1998, Onslow Ford, Bogzaran, and Robert Anthoine cofounded the nonprofit organization Lucid Art Foundation in order to explore the relationship between art, consciousness, and nature through art exhibitions, publications, and seminars for artists.

==Exhibitions==

In the 1990s,Onslow Ford has had several retrospectives and solo exhibitions in the United States, Germany, Chile, and Spain. In 1996, he inaugurated the John F. Kennedy University Arts and Consciousness Gallery and M.F.A. program in Berkeley, California, and received an honorary doctorate degree in Fine Arts from the university in 1997. His paintings are in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Tate Britain, de Young Museum, Oakland Museum of California, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. In 2010, Francis M. Naumann Fine Art showed &quot;Paintings and Works on Paper: 1939-1951&quot;, the first solo show of Onslow Ford&#x27;s work in New York since 1946.

Onslow Ford died peacefully in his home on 9 November 2003. He was 90. He left his legacy to the Lucid Art Foundation.

<text>True frogs is the common name for the frog family Ranidae. They have the widest distribution of any frog family. They are abundant throughout most of the world, occurring on all continents except Antarctica. The true frogs are present in North America, northern South America, Europe, Africa (including Madagascar), and Asia. The Asian range extends across the East Indies to New Guinea and a single species, the Australian wood frog (&quot;Hylarana daemelii&quot;), has spread into the far north of Australia.

Typically, true frogs are smooth and moist-skinned, with large, powerful legs and extensively webbed feet. The true frogs vary greatly in size, ranging from small—such as the wood frog (&quot;Lithobates sylvatica&quot;)—to large.

Many of the true frogs are aquatic or live close to water. Most species lay their eggs in the water and go through a tadpole stage. However, as in most families of frogs, there is large variation of habitat within the family. There are also arboreal species of true frogs, and the family includes some of the very few amphibians that can live in brackish water.

== Evolution ==
The Ranidae are related to several other frog families that have Eurasian and Indian origins, including Rhacophoridae, Dicroglossidae, Nyctibatrachidae, Micrixalidae, and Ranixalidae. They are thought to be most closely related to the Indian-endemic Nyctibatrachidae, from which they diverged in the early Eocene. However, other studies recover a closer relationship with the Dicroglossidae.

It was previously thought that the Ranidae and their closest relatives were of Gondwanan origins, having evolved on Insular India during the Cretaceous. They were then entirely restricted to the Indian subcontinent until the late Eocene, when India collided with Asia, allowing the Ranidae to colonize Eurasia and eventually the rest of the world. However, more recent studies instead propose that the Ranidae originated in Eurasia, and their close relationship with India-endemic frog lineages is due to those lineages colonizing India from Eurasia during the Paleogene.

==Systematics==
The subdivisions of the Ranidae are still a matter of dispute, although most are coming to an agreement. Several former subfamilies are now recognised as separate families (Petropedetidae, Cacosterninae, Mantellidae, and Dicroglossidae). The genus &quot;Rana&quot; has now been split up and is much reduced in size.

While too little of the vast diversity of true frogs has been subject to recent studies to say something definite, as of mid-2008, studies are going on, and several lineages are recognizable.
* The genus &quot;Staurois&quot; is probably a very ancient offshoot of the main Raninae lineage.
* &quot;Amolops&quot; has been generally delimited as a monophyletic group.
* &quot;Odorrana&quot; and &quot;Rana&quot; plus some proposed minor genera (which probably ought to be included in the latter) form another group.
* A group including &quot;Clinotarsus&quot;, &quot;Huia&quot; in the strict sense and &quot;Meristogenys&quot;
* An ill-defined assemblage of &quot;Babina&quot;, &quot;Glandirana&quot;, &quot;Hylarana&quot;, &quot;Pulchrana&quot;, &quot;Sanguirana&quot;, and &quot;Sylvirana&quot;, as well as &quot;Hydrophylax&quot; and &quot;Pelophylax&quot;, which are probably not monophyletic. Some authorities have treated them as junior synonyms of the genus &quot;Hylarana&quot;.
The following phylogeny of some genera was recovered by Che &quot;et al&quot;., 2007 using mitochondrial genes.

===Genera===
Most of the subfamilies formerly included under Ranidae are now treated as separate families, leaving only Raninae remaining. The following genera are recognised in the family Ranidae:
* &quot;Abavorana&quot; (three species)
* &quot;Amnirana&quot; (11 species)
* &quot;Amolops&quot; (80 species)
* &quot;Babina&quot; (two species)
* &quot;Chalcorana&quot; (nine species)
* &quot;Clinotarsus&quot; (three species)
* &quot;Glandirana&quot; (six species)
* &quot;Huia&quot; (monotypic)
* &quot;Humerana&quot; (four species)
* &quot;Hydrophylax&quot; (four species)
* &quot;Hylarana&quot; (four species)
* &quot;Indosylvirana&quot; (13 species)
* &quot;Lithobates&quot; (55 species)
* &quot;Meristogenys&quot; (13 species)
* &quot;Nidirana&quot; (19 species)
* &quot;Odorrana&quot; (64 species)
* &quot;Papurana&quot; (19 species)
* &quot;Pelophylax&quot; (19 species)
* &quot;Pseudorana&quot; (monotypic)
* &quot;Pterorana&quot; (monotypic)
* &quot;Pulchrana&quot; (18 species)
* &quot;Rana&quot; (58 species)
* &quot;Sanguirana&quot; (six species)
* &quot;Staurois&quot; (six species)
* &quot;Sumaterana&quot; (three species)
* &quot;Sylvirana&quot; (12 species)
* &quot;Wijayarana&quot; (five species)
In 2023, &quot;Amphibian Species of the World&quot; tentatively synonymized &quot;Amnirana&quot;, &quot;Chalcorana&quot;, &quot;Humerana&quot;, &quot;Hydrophylax&quot;, &quot;Indosylvirana&quot;, &quot;Papurana&quot;, &quot;Pulchrana&quot;, and &quot;Sylvirana&quot; into &quot;Hylarana&quot; until significant taxonomic confusion surrounding the group could be cleared up. These changes are not recognized by AmphibiaWeb.

=== &quot;Incertae sedis&quot; ===
A number of taxa are placed in Ranidae &quot;incertae sedis&quot;, that is, their taxonomic status is too uncertain to allow more specific placement. 
* &quot;Hylarana&quot; &quot;chitwanensis&quot; 
* &quot;Hylarana&quot; &quot;garoensis&quot; 
* &quot;Hylarana&quot; &quot;latouchii&quot; 
* &quot;Hylarana&quot; &quot;margariana&quot; 
* &quot;Hylarana&quot; &quot;montivaga&quot; 
* &quot;&quot;Hylarana&quot; &quot;persimilis&quot;

<text>Kuressaare () is a town on the island of Saaremaa in Estonia. It is the administrative centre of Saaremaa Municipality and the seat of Saare County. Kuressaare is the westernmost town in Estonia. The recorded population on 1 January 2024 was 13,185.

The town is situated on the southern coast of Saaremaa island, facing the Gulf of Riga of the Baltic Sea, and is served by the Kuressaare Airport, Roomassaare harbour, and Kuressaare yacht harbour.

==Names==

Kuressaare&#x27;s historic name Arensburg (from Middle High German &quot;a(a)r:&quot; eagle, raptor) renders the Latin denotation &quot;arx aquilae&quot; for the city&#x27;s castle. The fortress and the eagle, tetramorph symbol of Saint John the Evangelist, are also depicted on Kuressaare&#x27;s coat of arms.

The town, which grew around the fortress, was simultaneously known as Arensburg and Kuressaare linn; the latter name being a combination of &quot;Kuressaare&quot;—an ancient name of the Saaremaa Island—and &quot;linn&quot;, which means &quot;town&quot;. Alternatively, the town&#x27;s name may come from &quot;kurg&quot; (&quot;crane&quot;) and &quot;saare&quot; (&quot;island&quot;), a name that may have come from the city&#x27;s German name and coat of arms, or may have existed before German settlers arrived. Eventually, the town&#x27;s name shortened to Kuressaare and became official in 1918 after Estonia had declared its independence from Bolshevist Russia. Under Soviet rule, the town was renamed Kingissepa in 1952. This name came from the Bolshevik Kuressaare-native Viktor Kingissepp executed in 1922. The name Kuressaare was restored in 1988.

==History==
The town first appeared on maps around 1154. The island of Saaremaa (German, ) was conquered by the Livonian Brothers of the Sword under Volkwin of Naumburg in 1227, who merged with the Teutonic Knights shortly afterwards. The first documentation of the castle (&quot;arx aquilae&quot;) was found in Latin texts written in 1381 and 1422. Over time, a town, which became known as Arensburg or Kuressaarelinn, grew and flourished around the fortress. It became the see of the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek established by Albert of Riga in 1228, part of the Terra Mariana.

Johann von Münchhausen, bishop since 1542, converted to Protestantism. With the advance of the troops of Tsar Ivan IV of Russia in the course of the Livonian War, Münchhausen sold his lands to King Frederick II of Denmark in 1559 and returned to Germany. Frederick sent his younger brother Prince Magnus to Kuressaare where he was elected bishop the following year. It was through his influence that the city obtained its civic charter in 1563, modeled after that of Riga. The bishopric was finally secularised in 1572 and Kuressaare fell to the Danish Crown.

In 1645, it passed to Swedish control through the Treaty of Brömsebro after the Danish defeat in the Torstenson War. Queen Christina of Sweden granted her favourite, Magnus Gabriel de la Gardie, the title of Count of Arensburg, the German and Swedish name for Kuressaare at that time. The city was burnt to the ground by Russian troops in 1710 during the Great Northern War and suffered heavily from the plague. Abandoned by the Swedes, it was incorporated into the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire through the Treaty of Nystad in 1721.

During the 19th century Kuressaare became a popular seaside resort on the Baltic coast. During World War I, between September and October 1917, German land and naval forces occupied Saaremaa with Operation Albion. During World War II, the Battle of Tehumardi took place. In October 1990, Kuressaare was the first town in Estonia to regain its self-governing status.

== Tourism ==

=== Tourism ===
Kuressaare is a well-known summer and resort town. The city is one of the most visited tourist centers in Estonia. The first known tourist group visited Kuressaare almost 165 years ago.

=== History ===
In the middle of the 19th century, Kuressaare became a spa town when large reserves of healing mud were discovered near the town. The first mud spa was built in 1840, but healing with mud baths has been tested on the west coast of Saaremaa since the mid-1820s. It was the health mud that became Kuressaare&#x27;s key word. New sanatoriums and boarding houses were created, the order was considerably improved and the number of visitors continued to grow.

Between 1918 and 1940, the resort&#x27;s heyday continued. The share of Russians among visitors decreased, giving way to Latvians, Finns and Swedes.

The development of tourism slowed down from the beginning of the Second World War until the end of the Soviet occupation, when the entire Saaremaa was declared a closed border zone, which excluded all foreign tourism. Only strictly limited and controlled domestic tourism was allowed.

Today, Kuressaare is once again a resort town. New health facilities and hotels have been built, and historical monuments have been restored. Two thirds of the current visitors to the city are mainland Estonians, the remaining visitors are mainly from Finland, Sweden and Latvia.

=== Sights ===
In the old town of Kuressaare, mainly the 18th and 19th centuries have been preserved. historical buildings from the 19th century, but there are also older ones. In the old town there are, for example, St. Nicholas Church and Laurentius Church, a goods yard, an old mill (1899), a harbor yard (1663) and residential buildings. The baroque town hall and council house date from the Swedish era in the 17th century, while the building of the Saaremaa Knights, located next to the Kuressaare town hall, dates from the 18th century. Among the oldest preserved buildings are also the parsonage building at Kauba tänav 5 and the Põlluvahi house at the corner of Kitsa and Kitzbergi streets.

==== Kuressaare bishop castle ====
The city&#x27;s biggest attraction is the Kuressaare Bishop&#x27;s Castle, which mainly dates from the 14th century, and currently houses the Saaremaa Museum. The square-shaped fortress consists of four building wings around the courtyard. On the northeast side are the gate and two towers: Pikk Hermann and Sturvolt. 17-18 are also important. The powerful earthen fortifications of the Kuressaare fortress around the medieval fortress core date from the 19th century. Kuressaare Castle is one of the best preserved in the Baltic States. It has been restored several times since the beginning of the 20th century. Since 2001, Kuressaare Castle Days have been organized every summer with knight tournaments, theatrical tours and processions, and other medieval attractions.

To the south-west of the castle is Tori bay, where the port of Kuressaare is located.

Kuressaare Castle Park and the historicist-style Kuressaare Kursaal are the center of resort life. Both were founded in the second half of the 19th century.

At the beginning of Lossi Street, in the former fish market, there is a monument to those who fell in the Estonian War of Independence.

There are bus connections around the island, as well as with Kuivastu on Muhu Island, a ferry terminal with connection to the mainland.

In 1917, during the German occupation, an urban railway was built in Kuressaare, and in 1918, it was transferred to the town administration. It connected the port with the city center. One of the stations was provisionally located in Kurhouse, and in 1924, the dedicated Park Station was built.

<text>The sensory nervous system is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing sensory information. A sensory system consists of sensory neurons (including the sensory receptor cells), neural pathways, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception and interoception. Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell, balance and visceral sensation. Sense organs are transducers that convert data from the outer physical world to the realm of the mind where people interpret the information, creating their perception of the world around them.

The receptive field is the area of the body or environment to which a receptor organ and receptor cells respond. For instance, the part of the world an eye can see, is its receptive field; the light that each rod or cone can see, is its receptive field. Receptive fields have been identified for the visual system, auditory system and somatosensory system.

==Senses and receptors==

While debate exists among neurologists as to the specific number of senses due to differing definitions of what constitutes a sense, Gautama Buddha and Aristotle classified five &#x27;traditional&#x27; human senses which have become universally accepted: touch, taste, smell, vision, and hearing. Other senses that have been well-accepted in most mammals, including humans, include pain, balance, kinaesthesia, and temperature. Furthermore, some nonhuman animals have been shown to possess alternate senses, including magnetoreception and electroreception.

===Receptors===
The initialization of sensation stems from the response of a specific receptor to a physical stimulus. The receptors which react to the stimulus and initiate the process of sensation are commonly characterized in four distinct categories: chemoreceptors, photoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, and thermoreceptors. All receptors receive distinct physical stimuli and transduce the signal into an electrical action potential. This action potential then travels along afferent neurons to specific brain regions where it is processed and interpreted.

===Chemoreceptors===

Chemoreceptors, or chemosensors, detect certain chemical stimuli and transduce that signal into an electrical action potential. The two primary types of chemoreceptors are:
# Distance chemoreceptors are integral to receiving stimuli in gases in the olfactory system through both olfactory receptor neurons and neurons in the vomeronasal organ.
# Direct chemoreceptors that detect stimuli in liquids include the taste buds in the gustatory system as well as receptors in the aortic bodies which detect changes in oxygen concentration.

===Photoreceptors===

Photoreceptors are neuron cells and are specialized units that play the main role in initiating vision function. Photoreceptors are light-sensitive cells that capture different wavelengths of light. Different types of photoreceptors are able to respond to the varying light wavelengths in relation to color, and transduce them into electrical signals. Photoreceptors are capable of phototransduction, a process which converts light (electromagnetic radiation) into, among other types of energy, a membrane potential. There are five compartments that are present in these cells. Each compartment corresponds to differences in function and structure. The first compartment is the outer segment (OS), where it is responsible for capturing light and transducing it. The second compartment is the inner segment (IS), which includes the necessary organelles that function in cellular metabolism and biosynthesis. Mainly, these organelles include mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum as well as among others. The third compartment is the connecting cilium (CC). As its name suggests, CC works to connect the OS and the IS regions together for the purpose of essential protein trafficking. The fourth compartment contains the nucleus and is a continuation of the IS region, known as the nuclear region. Finally, the fifth compartment is the synaptic region, where it acts as a final terminal for the signal, consisting of synaptic vesicles. In this region, glutamate neurotransmitter is transmitted from the cell to secondary neuron cells. The three primary types of photoreceptors are:
cones are photoreceptors which respond significantly to color. In humans, the three different types of cones correspond with a primary response to short wavelength (blue), medium wavelength (green), and long wavelength (yellow/red).
Rods are photoreceptors which are very sensitive to the intensity of light, allowing for vision in dim lighting. The concentrations and ratio of rods to cones is strongly correlated with whether an animal is diurnal or nocturnal. In humans, rods outnumber cones by approximately 20:1, while in nocturnal animals, such as the tawny owl, the ratio is closer to 1000:1.
Ganglion cells reside in the adrenal medulla and retina where they are involved in the sympathetic response. Of the ~1.3 million ganglion cells present in the retina, 1–2% are believed to be photosensitive ganglia. These photosensitive ganglia play a role in conscious vision for some animals, and are believed to do the same in humans.

===Mechanoreceptors===

Mechanoreceptors are sensory receptors which respond to mechanical forces, such as pressure or distortion. While mechanoreceptors are present in hair cells and play an integral role in the vestibular and auditory systems, the majority of mechanoreceptors are cutaneous and are grouped into four categories:
# &quot;Slowly adapting type 1 receptors&quot; have small receptive fields and respond to static stimulation. These receptors are primarily used in the sensations of form and roughness.
# &quot;Slowly adapting type 2 receptors&quot; have large receptive fields and respond to stretch. Similarly to type 1, they produce sustained responses to a continued stimuli.
# &quot;Rapidly adapting receptors&quot; have small receptive fields and underlie the perception of slip.
# &quot;Pacinian receptors&quot; have large receptive fields and are the predominant receptors for high-frequency vibration.

=== Thermoreceptors ===

Thermoreceptors are sensory receptors which respond to varying temperatures. While the mechanisms through which these receptors operate is unclear, recent discoveries have shown that mammals have at least two distinct types of thermoreceptors:
# The end-bulb of Krause or bulboid corpuscle detects temperatures above body temperature.
# Ruffini&#x27;s end organ detects temperatures below body temperature.

TRPV1 is a heat-activated channel that acts as a small heat detecting thermometer in the membrane which begins the polarization of the neural fiber when exposed to changes in temperature. Ultimately, this allows us to detect ambient temperature in the warm/hot range. Similarly, the molecular cousin to TRPV1, TRPM8, is a cold-activated ion channel that responds to cold. Both cold and hot receptors are segregated by distinct subpopulations of sensory nerve fibers, which shows us that the information coming into the spinal cord is originally separate. Each sensory receptor has its own &quot;labeled line&quot; to convey a simple sensation experienced by the recipient. Ultimately, TRP channels act as thermosensors, channels that help us to detect changes in ambient temperatures.

=== Nociceptors ===

Nociceptors respond to potentially damaging stimuli by sending signals to the spinal cord and brain. This process, called nociception, usually causes the perception of pain. They are found in internal organs, as well as on the surface of the body. Nociceptors detect different kinds of damaging stimuli or actual damage. Those that only respond when tissues are damaged are known as &quot;sleeping&quot; or &quot;silent&quot; nociceptors.
# Thermal nociceptors are activated by noxious heat or cold at various temperatures.
# Mechanical nociceptors respond to excess pressure or mechanical deformation.
# Chemical nociceptors respond to a wide variety of chemicals, some of which are signs of tissue damage. They are involved in the detection of some spices in food.

== Sensory cortex ==

All stimuli received by the receptors listed above are transduced to an action potential, which is carried along one or more afferent neurons towards a specific area of the brain. While the term sensory cortex is often used informally to refer to the somatosensory cortex, the term more formally refers to the multiple areas of the brain at which senses are received to be processed. For the five traditional senses in humans, this includes the primary and secondary cortices of the different senses: the somatosensory cortex, the visual cortex, the auditory cortex, the primary olfactory cortex, and the gustatory cortex. Other modalities have corresponding sensory cortex areas as well, including the vestibular cortex for the sense of balance.

The human sensory system consists of the following subsystems:
* Visual system (Vision)
* Auditory system (Hearing)
* Somatosensory system (Touch/Temperature/Kinesthesia/Pain)
* Gustatory system (Taste)
* Olfactory system (Smell)
* Vestibular system (Balance)

===Somatosensory cortex===
Located in the parietal lobe, the primary somatosensory cortex is the primary receptive area for the sense of touch and proprioception in the somatosensory system. This cortex is further divided into Brodmann areas 1, 2, and 3. Brodmann area 3 is considered the primary processing center of the somatosensory cortex as it receives significantly more input from the thalamus, has neurons highly responsive to somatosensory stimuli, and can evoke somatic sensations through electrical stimulation. Areas 1 and 2 receive most of their input from area 3. There are also pathways for proprioception (via the cerebellum), and motor control (via Brodmann area 4). See also: S2 Secondary somatosensory cortex.
===Visual cortex===
The visual cortex refers to the primary visual cortex, labeled V1 or Brodmann area 17, as well as the extrastriate visual cortical areas V2-V5. Located in the occipital lobe, V1 acts as the primary relay station for visual input, transmitting information to two primary pathways labeled the dorsal and ventral streams. The dorsal stream includes areas V2 and V5, and is used in interpreting visual &#x27;where&#x27; and &#x27;how.&#x27; The ventral stream includes areas V2 and V4, and is used in interpreting &#x27;what.&#x27; Increases in task-negative activity are observed in the ventral attention network, after abrupt changes in sensory stimuli, at the onset and offset of task blocks, and at the end of a completed trial.
===Auditory cortex===
Located in the temporal lobe, the auditory cortex is the primary receptive area for sound information. The auditory cortex is composed of Brodmann areas 41 and 42, also known as the anterior transverse temporal area 41 and the posterior transverse temporal area 42, respectively. Both areas act similarly and are integral in receiving and processing the signals transmitted from auditory receptors.
===Primary olfactory cortex===
Located in the temporal lobe, the primary olfactory cortex is the primary receptive area for olfaction, or smell. Unique to the olfactory and gustatory systems, at least in mammals, is the implementation of both peripheral and central mechanisms of action. The peripheral mechanisms involve olfactory receptor neurons which transduce a chemical signal along the olfactory nerve, which terminates in the olfactory bulb. The chemoreceptors in the receptor neurons that start the signal cascade are G protein-coupled receptors. The central mechanisms include the convergence of olfactory nerve axons into glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, where the signal is then transmitted to the anterior olfactory nucleus, the piriform cortex, the medial amygdala, and the entorhinal cortex, all of which make up the primary olfactory cortex.

In contrast to vision and hearing, the olfactory bulbs are not cross-hemispheric; the right bulb connects to the right hemisphere and the left bulb connects to the left hemisphere.
===Gustatory cortex===
The gustatory cortex is the primary receptive area for taste. The word &quot;taste&quot; is used in a technical sense to refer specifically to sensations coming from taste buds on the tongue. The five qualities of taste detected by the tongue include sourness, bitterness, sweetness, saltiness, and the protein taste quality, called umami. In contrast, the term &quot;flavor&quot; refers to the experience generated through integration of taste with smell and tactile information. The gustatory cortex consists of two primary structures: the anterior insula, located on the insular lobe, and the frontal operculum, located on the frontal lobe. Similarly to the olfactory cortex, the gustatory pathway operates through both peripheral and central mechanisms. Peripheral taste receptors, located on the tongue, soft palate, pharynx, and esophagus, transmit the received signal to primary sensory axons, where the signal is projected to the nucleus of the solitary tract in the medulla, or the gustatory nucleus of the solitary tract complex. The signal is then transmitted to the thalamus, which in turn projects the signal to several regions of the neocortex, including the gustatory cortex.

The neural processing of taste is affected at nearly every stage of processing by concurrent somatosensory information from the tongue, that is, mouthfeel. Scent, in contrast, is not combined with taste to create flavor until higher cortical processing regions, such as the insula and orbitofrontal cortex.

== Quiescent state ==
Most sensory systems have a quiescent state, that is, the state that a sensory system converges to when there is no input.

This is well-defined for a linear time-invariant system, whose input space is a vector space, and thus by definition has a point of zero. It is also well-defined for any passive sensory system, that is, a system that operates without needing input power. The quiescent state is the state the system converges to when there is no input power.

It is not always well-defined for nonlinear, nonpassive sensory organs, since they can&#x27;t function without input energy. For example, a cochlea is not a passive organ, but actively vibrates its own sensory hairs to improve its sensitivity. This manifests as otoacoustic emissions in healthy ears, and tinnitus in pathological ears. There is still a quiescent state for the cochlea, since there is a well-defined mode of power input that it receives (vibratory energy on the eardrum), which provides an unambiguous definition of &quot;zero input power&quot;.

Some sensory systems can have multiple quiescent states depending on its history, like flip-flops, and magnetic material with hysteresis. It can also adapt to different quiescent states. In complete darkness, the retinal cells become extremely sensitive, and there is noticeable &quot;visual snow&quot; caused by the retinal cells firing randomly without any light input. In brighter light, the retinal cells become much less sensitive, consequently decreasing visual noise.

Quiescent state is less well-defined when the sensory organ can be controlled by other systems, like a dog&#x27;s ears that turn towards the front or the sides as the brain commands. Some spiders can use their nets as a large touch-organ, like weaving a skin for themselves. Even in the absence of anything falling on the net, hungry spiders may increase web thread tension, so as to respond promptly even to usually less noticeable, and less profitable prey, such as small fruit flies, creating two different &quot;quiescent states&quot; for the net.

Things become completely ill-defined for a system which connects its output to its own input, thus ever-moving without any external input. The prime example is the brain, with its default mode network.

<text>The National Stock Exchange (NSX) is an electronic stock exchange based in Jersey City, New Jersey. It was founded March 1885 in Cincinnati, Ohio, as the Cincinnati Stock Exchange.

In 1995, it moved headquarters to Chicago, Illinois, and it was renamed the National Stock Exchange in 2003. After demutualizing in 2006, it moved headquarters to Jersey City. In 2011, CBOE Stock Exchange acquired the National Stock Exchange, with both exchanges operating under separate names. The NSX ceased trading operations on February 1, 2017, when it was acquired by the New York Stock Exchange, and reopened on May 21, 2018.

==History==
===Early name changes===
National Stock Exchange was founded March 1885 in Cincinnati, Ohio, as the Cincinnati Stock Exchange. In 1976, it closed its physical trading floor and became an all-electronic stock market. The Cincinnati Stock Exchange moved its headquarters to Chicago in 1995, and changed its name to the National Stock Exchange – NSX – on November 7, 2003. Owned by its members since inception, it demutualized in 2006. It later moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey. In September 2011, CBOE Stock Exchange (CBSX) entered into an agreement to acquire the National Stock Exchange. The acquisition was completed on December 30, 2011, with both exchanges to operate under separate names. The National Stock Exchange continued to be based in Jersey City.

===2014–2015 shutdown===
In May 2014, the exchange &quot;changed its pricing structure to charge both sides of a trade a fee for securities priced $1 or more, a departure from other public venues that usually charge one side and pay a rebate to another.&quot; With David Harris as chief executive officer, the National Stock Exchange ceased trading operations on May 30, 2014. The exchange stated in a release that it, &quot;continues to be registered as a national securities exchange under Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act (the &quot;Act&quot;) and remains a self-regulatory organization. All NSX rules remain in full force and effect.&quot; The closure brought the number of active stock exchanges in the United States to 11, as the CBOE Stock Exchange had closed the month prior. Wrote &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, &quot;just one public exchange, Chicago Stock Exchange Inc., that isn’t owned Bats, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. or IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc.&quot; On February 24, 2015, the NSX was bought by a private entity known as National Stock Exchange Holdings. Trading resumed on December 22, 2015.

===NYSE acquisition===
The New York Stock Exchange announced it has entered into an agreement to acquire the NSX, subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval. The NSX ceased trading operations on February 1, 2017. NYSE plans to bring it back on its new trading platform Pillar, some time in the distant future.

NSX was to be renamed &quot;NYSE National&quot; as a result of the acquisition by NYSE.

On January 12, 2018, an SEC filing for rule changes was made to support re-activation of NYSE National, Inc. in the second quarter of 2018 (on the Pillar trading platform as previously noted). NYSE National opened for business on May 21, 2018. The difference between NYSE National and other NYSE exchanges is that it uses a taker-maker pricing model, which offers rebates for adding liquidity, rather than payment for order flow or other models.

==Previous exchanges named NSX==
Two previous exchanges, both located in New York City, operated as the National Stock Exchange. The first exchange operated for seven months to September 1869. The other, associated with the New York Mercantile Exchange, traded from March 7, 1962, to January 31, 1975.

<text>In electronics, a Schmitt trigger is a comparator circuit with hysteresis implemented by applying positive feedback to the noninverting input of a comparator or differential amplifier. It is an active circuit which converts an analog input signal to a digital output signal. The circuit is named a &quot;trigger&quot; because the output retains its value until the input changes sufficiently to trigger a change. In the non-inverting configuration, when the input is higher than a chosen threshold, the output is high. When the input is below a different (lower) chosen threshold the output is low, and when the input is between the two levels the output retains its value. This dual threshold action is called &quot;hysteresis&quot; and implies that the Schmitt trigger possesses memory and can act as a bistable multivibrator (latch or flip-flop). There is a close relation between the two kinds of circuits: a Schmitt trigger can be converted into a latch and a latch can be converted into a Schmitt trigger.

Schmitt trigger devices are typically used in signal conditioning applications to remove noise from signals used in digital circuits, particularly mechanical contact bounce in switches. They are also used in closed loop negative feedback configurations to implement relaxation oscillators, used in function generators and switching power supplies.

In signal theory, a schmitt trigger is essentially a one-bit quantizer.

==History==
The Schmitt trigger was invented by American scientist Otto H. Schmitt in 1934 while he was a graduate student, later described in his doctoral dissertation (1937) as a &quot;thermionic trigger&quot;. It was a direct result of Schmitt&#x27;s study of the neural impulse propagation in squid nerves.

==Implementation==
=== Fundamental idea ===
Circuits with hysteresis are based on positive feedback. Any active circuit can be made to behave as a Schmitt trigger by applying positive feedback so that the loop gain is more than one. The positive feedback is introduced by adding a part of the output voltage to the input voltage. These circuits contain an attenuator (the B box in the figure on the right) and an adder (the circle with &quot;+&quot; inside) in addition to an amplifier acting as a comparator. There are three specific techniques for implementing this general idea. The first two of them are dual versions (series and parallel) of the general positive feedback system. In these configurations, the output voltage increases the effective difference input voltage of the comparator by &quot;decreasing the threshold&quot; or by &quot;increasing the circuit input voltage&quot;; the threshold and memory properties are incorporated in one element. In the third technique, the threshold and memory properties are separated.

Dynamic threshold (series feedback): when the input voltage crosses the threshold in either direction, the circuit itself changes its own threshold to the opposite direction. For this purpose, it subtracts a part of its output voltage from the threshold (it is equal to adding voltage to the input voltage). Thus the output affects the threshold and does not affect the input voltage. These circuits are implemented by a differential amplifier with &quot;series positive feedback&quot; where the input is connected to the inverting input and the inverted output to the non-inverting input. In this arrangement, attenuation and summation are separated: a voltage divider acts as an attenuator and the loop acts as a simple series voltage summer. Examples are the classic transistor emitter-coupled Schmitt trigger, the op-amp inverting Schmitt trigger, etc.

Modified input voltage (parallel feedback): when the input voltage crosses the threshold in either direction the circuit changes its input voltage in the same direction (now it adds a part of its output voltage directly to the input voltage). Thus the output augments the input voltage and does not affect the threshold. These circuits can be implemented by a single-ended non-inverting amplifier with &quot;parallel positive feedback&quot; where the input and the output sources are connected through resistors to the input. The two resistors form a weighted parallel summer incorporating both the attenuation and summation. Examples are the less familiar collector-base coupled Schmitt trigger, the op-amp non-inverting Schmitt trigger, etc.

Some circuits and elements exhibiting negative resistance can also act in a similar way: negative impedance converters (NIC), neon lamps, tunnel diodes (e.g., a diode with an N-shaped current–voltage characteristic in the first quadrant), etc. In the last case, an oscillating input will cause the diode to move from one rising leg of the &quot;N&quot; to the other and back again as the input crosses the rising and falling switching thresholds.

Two different unidirectional thresholds are assigned in this case to two separate open-loop comparators (without hysteresis) driving a bistable multivibrator (latch) or flip-flop. The trigger is toggled high when the input voltage crosses down to up the high threshold and low when the input voltage crosses up to down the low threshold. Again, there is a positive feedback, but now it is concentrated only in the memory cell. Examples are the 555 timer and the switch debouncing circuit.

The symbol for Schmitt triggers in circuit diagrams is a triangle with a symbol inside representing its ideal hysteresis curve.

=== Transistor Schmitt triggers ===
==== Classic emitter-coupled circuit ====
The original Schmitt trigger is based on the dynamic threshold idea that is implemented by a voltage divider with a switchable upper leg (the collector resistors RC1 and RC2) and a steady lower leg (RE). Q1 acts as a comparator with a differential input (Q1 base-emitter junction) consisting of an inverting (Q1 base) and a non-inverting (Q1 emitter) inputs. The input voltage is applied to the inverting input; the output voltage of the voltage divider is applied to the non-inverting input thus determining its threshold. The comparator output drives the second common collector stage Q2 (an &quot;emitter follower&quot;) through the voltage divider R1-R2. The emitter-coupled transistors Q1 and Q2 actually compose an electronic double throw switch that switches over the upper legs of the voltage divider and changes the threshold in a different (to the input voltage) direction.

This configuration can be considered as a differential amplifier with series positive feedback between its non-inverting input (Q2 base) and output (Q1 collector) that forces the transition process. There is also a smaller negative feedback introduced by the emitter resistor RE. To make the positive feedback dominate over the negative one and to obtain a hysteresis, the proportion between the two collector resistors is chosen so that RC1 &gt; RC2. Thus less current flows through and there is less voltage drop across RE when Q1 is switched on than in the case when Q2 is switched on. As a result, the circuit has two different thresholds in regard to ground (V− in the image).

===== Operation =====
Initial state. For the NPN transistors shown on the right, imagine the input voltage is below the shared emitter voltage (high threshold for concreteness) so that the Q1 base-emitter junction is reverse-biased and Q1 does not conduct. The Q2 base voltage is determined by the divider described above so that Q2 is conducting and the trigger output is in the low state. The two resistors RC2 and RE form another voltage divider that determines the high threshold. Neglecting VBE, the high threshold value is approximately

:formula_1.

The output voltage is low but well above ground. It is approximately equal to the high threshold and may not be low enough to be a logical zero for subsequent digital circuits. This may require an additional level shifting circuit following the trigger circuit.

Crossing up the high threshold. When the input voltage (Q1 base voltage) rises slightly above the voltage across the emitter resistor RE (the high threshold), Q1 begins conducting. Its collector voltage goes down and Q2 starts toward cutoff, because the voltage divider now provides lower Q2 base voltage. The common emitter voltage follows this change and goes down, making Q1 conduct more. The current begins to steer from the right leg of the circuit to the left one. Although Q1 is conducting more, it passes less current through RE (since RC1 &gt; RC2); the emitter voltage continues dropping and the effective Q1 base-emitter voltage continuously increases. This avalanche-like process continues until Q1 becomes completely turned on (saturated) and Q2 turned off. The trigger transitions to the high state and the output (Q2&#x27;s collector) voltage is close to V+. Now the two resistors RC1 and RE form a voltage divider that determines the low threshold. Its value is approximately

:formula_2.

Crossing down the low threshold. With the trigger now in the high state, if the input voltage drops enough (below the low threshold), Q1 begins cutting off. Its collector current reduces; as a result, the shared emitter voltage drops slightly and Q1&#x27;s collector voltage rises significantly. The R1-R2 voltage divider conveys this change to the Q2 base voltage and it begins conducting. The voltage across RE rises, further reducing the Q1 base-emitter potential in the same avalanche-like manner, and Q1 ceases to conduct. Q2 becomes completely turned on (saturated) and the output voltage becomes low again.

===== Variations =====
Non-inverting circuit. The classic non-inverting Schmitt trigger can be turned into an inverting trigger by taking Vout from the emitters instead of from a Q2 collector. In this configuration, the output voltage is equal to the dynamic threshold (the shared emitter voltage) and both the output levels stay away from the supply rails. Another disadvantage is that the load changes the thresholds so, it has to be high enough. The base resistor RB is obligatory to prevent the impact of the input voltage through Q1 base-emitter junction on the emitter voltage.

Direct-coupled circuit. To simplify the circuit, the R1–R2 voltage divider can be omitted connecting Q1 collector directly to Q2 base. The base resistor RB can be omitted as well so that the input voltage source drives directly Q1&#x27;s base. In this case, the common emitter voltage and Q1 collector voltage are not suitable for outputs. Only Q2 collector should be used as an output since, when the input voltage exceeds the high threshold and Q1 saturates, its base-emitter junction is forward biased and transfers the input voltage variations directly to the emitters. As a result, the common emitter voltage and Q1 collector voltage follow the input voltage. This situation is typical for over-driven transistor differential amplifiers and ECL gates.

==== Collector-base coupled circuit ====
Like every latch, the fundamental collector-base coupled bistable circuit operates with hysteresis. It can be converted to a Schmitt trigger by connecting an additional base resistor R to one of the inputs (Q1&#x27;s base in the figure). The two resistors R and R4 form a parallel voltage summer (the circle in the block diagram above) that sums output (Q2&#x27;s collector) voltage and the input voltage, and drives the single-ended transistor &quot;comparator&quot; Q1. When the base voltage crosses the threshold (VBE0 ∞ 0.65 V) in either direction, a part of Q2&#x27;s collector voltage is added in the same direction to the input voltage. Thus the output modifies the input voltage by means of parallel positive feedback and does not affect the threshold (the base-emitter voltage).

=== Comparison between emitter- and collector-coupled circuit ===
The emitter-coupled version has the advantage that the input transistor is reverse biased when the input voltage is quite below the high threshold so the transistor is definitely cut off. This was important when germanium transistors were used for implementing the circuit, and this configuration has continued to be popular. The input base resistor can be omitted, since the emitter resistor limits the current when the input base-emitter junction is forward-biased.

An emitter-coupled Schmitt trigger &quot;logical zero&quot; output level may not be low enough and might need an additional output level shifting circuit. The collector-coupled Schmitt trigger has extremely low (almost zero) output at &quot;logical zero&quot;.

=== Op-amp implementations ===
Schmitt triggers are commonly implemented using an operational amplifier or a dedicated comparator. An open-loop op-amp and comparator may be considered as an analog-digital device having analog inputs and a digital output that extracts the sign of the voltage difference between its two inputs. The positive feedback is applied by adding a part of the output voltage to the input voltage in series or parallel manner. Due to the extremely high op-amp gain, the loop gain is also high enough and provides the avalanche-like process.

==== Non-inverting Schmitt trigger ====
In this circuit, the two resistors R1 and R2 form a parallel voltage summer. It adds a part of the output voltage to the input voltage thus augmenting it during and after switching that occurs when the resulting voltage is near ground. This &quot;parallel positive feedback&quot; creates the needed hysteresis that is controlled by the proportion between the resistances of R1 and R2. The output of the parallel voltage summer is single-ended (it produces voltage with respect to ground) so the circuit does not need an amplifier with a differential input. Since conventional op-amps have a differential input, the inverting input is grounded to make the reference point zero volts.

The output voltage always has the same sign as the &quot;op-amp input voltage&quot; but it does not always have the same sign as the &quot;circuit input voltage&quot; (the signs of the two input voltages can differ). When the circuit input voltage is above the high threshold or below the low threshold, the output voltage has the same sign as the &quot;circuit input voltage&quot; (the circuit is non-inverting). It acts like a comparator that switches at a different point depending on whether the output of the comparator is high or low. When the circuit input voltage is between the thresholds, the output voltage is undefined and it depends on the last state (the circuit behaves as an elementary latch).

For instance, if the Schmitt trigger is currently in the high state, the output will be at the positive power supply rail (+VS). The output voltage V+ of the resistive summer can be found by applying the superposition theorem:

:formula_3

The comparator will switch when V+=0. Then formula_4 (the same result can be obtained by applying the current conservation principle). So formula_5 must drop below formula_6 to get the output to switch. Once the comparator output has switched to −&quot;V&quot;S, the threshold becomes formula_7 to switch back to high. So this circuit creates a switching band centered on zero, with trigger levels formula_8 (it can be shifted to the left or the right by applying a bias voltage to the inverting input). The input voltage must rise above the top of the band, and then below the bottom of the band, for the output to switch on (plus) and then back off (minus). If &quot;R&quot;1 is zero or &quot;R&quot;2 is infinity (i.e., an open circuit), the band collapses to zero width, and it behaves as a standard comparator. The transfer characteristic is shown in the picture on the left. The value of the threshold &quot;T&quot; is given by formula_9 and the maximum value of the output &quot;M&quot; is the power supply rail.

A unique property of circuits with parallel positive feedback is the impact on the input source. In circuits with negative parallel feedback (e.g., an inverting amplifier), the virtual ground at the inverting input separates the input source from the op-amp output. Here there is no virtual ground, and the steady op-amp output voltage is applied through R1-R2 network to the input source. The op-amp output passes an opposite current through the input source (it injects current into the source when the input voltage is positive and it draws current from the source when it is negative).

A practical Schmitt trigger with precise thresholds is shown in the figure on the right. The transfer characteristic has exactly the same shape of the previous basic configuration, and the threshold values are the same as well. On the other hand, in the previous case, the output voltage was depending on the power supply, while now it is defined by the Zener diodes (which could also be replaced with a single double-anode Zener diode). In this configuration, the output levels can be modified by appropriate choice of Zener diode, and these levels are resistant to power supply fluctuations (i.e., they increase the PSRR of the comparator). The resistor &quot;R&quot;3 is there to limit the current through the diodes, and the resistor &quot;R&quot;4 minimizes the input voltage offset caused by the comparator&#x27;s input leakage currents (see &quot;limitations of real op-amps&quot;).

==== Inverting Schmitt trigger ====
In the inverting version, the attenuation and summation are separated. The two resistors R1 and R2 act only as a &quot;pure&quot; attenuator (voltage divider). The input loop acts as a series voltage summer that adds a part of the output voltage in series to the circuit input voltage. This &quot;series positive feedback&quot; creates the needed hysteresis that is controlled by the proportion between the resistances of R1 and the whole resistance (R1 and R2). The effective voltage applied to the op-amp input is floating so the op-amp must have a differential input.

The circuit is named &quot;inverting&quot; since the output voltage always has an opposite sign to the input voltage when it is out of the hysteresis cycle (when the input voltage is above the high threshold or below the low threshold). However, if the input voltage is within the hysteresis cycle (between the high and low thresholds), the circuit can be inverting as well as non-inverting. The output voltage is undefined and it depends on the last state so the circuit behaves like an elementary latch.

To compare the two versions, the circuit operation will be considered at the same conditions as above. If the Schmitt trigger is currently in the high state, the output will be at the positive power supply rail (+VS). The output voltage V+ of the voltage divider is:

:formula_10

The comparator will switch when Vin = V+. So formula_5 must exceed above this voltage to get the output to switch. Once the comparator output has switched to −&quot;V&quot;S, the threshold becomes formula_12 to switch back to high. So this circuit creates a switching band centered on zero, with trigger levels formula_13 (it can be shifted to the left or the right by connecting R1 to a bias voltage). The input voltage must rise above the top of the band, and then below the bottom of the band, for the output to switch off (minus) and then back on (plus). If &quot;R&quot;1 is zero (i.e., a short circuit) or &quot;R&quot;2 is infinity, the band collapses to zero width, and it behaves as a standard comparator.

In contrast with the parallel version, this circuit does not impact on the input source since the source is separated from the voltage divider output by the high op-amp input differential impedance.

In the inverting amplifier voltage drop across resistor (R1) decides the reference voltages i.e., upper threshold voltage (V+) and lower threshold voltages (V−) for the comparison with input signal applied. These voltages are fixed as the output voltage and resistor values are fixed.

so by changing the drop across (R1) threshold voltages can be varied. By adding a bias voltage in series with resistor (R1) drop across it can be varied, which can change threshold voltages. Desired values of reference voltages can be obtained by varying bias voltage.

The above equations can be modified as:
:formula_14

== Applications ==
Schmitt triggers are typically used in open loop configurations for noise immunity and closed loop configurations to implement function generators.
* Analog-to-digital conversion&quot;:&quot;   The Schmitt trigger is effectively a one bit analog to digital converter. When the signal reaches a given level it switches from its low to high state.
* Level detection&quot;:&quot;   The Schmitt trigger circuit is able to provide level detection. When undertaking this application, it is necessary that the hysteresis voltage is taken into account so that the circuit switches on the required voltage.
* Line reception&quot;:&quot;   When running a data line that may have picked up noise into a logic gate it is necessary to ensure that a logic output level is only changed as the data changed and not as a result of spurious noise that may have been picked up. Using a Schmitt trigger broadly enables the peak to peak noise to reach the level of the hysteresis before spurious triggering may occur.

=== Noise immunity ===
One application of a Schmitt trigger is to increase the noise immunity in a circuit with only a single input threshold. With only one input threshold, a noisy input signal near that threshold could cause the output to switch rapidly back and forth from noise alone. A noisy Schmitt Trigger input signal near one threshold can cause only one switch in output value, after which it would have to move beyond the other threshold in order to cause another switch.

For example, an amplified infrared photodiode may generate an electric signal that switches frequently between its absolute lowest value and its absolute highest value. This signal is then low-pass filtered to form a smooth signal that rises and falls corresponding to the relative amount of time the switching signal is on and off. That filtered output passes to the input of a Schmitt trigger. The net effect is that the output of the Schmitt trigger only passes from low to high after a received infrared signal excites the photodiode for longer than some known period, and once the Schmitt trigger is high, it only moves low after the infrared signal ceases to excite the photodiode for longer than a similar known period. Whereas the photodiode is prone to spurious switching due to noise from the environment, the delay added by the filter and Schmitt trigger ensures that the output only switches when there is certainly an input stimulating the device.

Schmitt triggers are common in many switching circuits for similar reasons (e.g., for switch debouncing).

=== Use as an oscillator ===


A Schmitt trigger is a bistable multivibrator, and it can be used to implement another type of multivibrator, the relaxation oscillator. This is achieved by connecting a single RC integrating circuit between the output and the input of an inverting Schmitt trigger. The output will be a continuous square wave whose frequency depends on the values of R and C, and the threshold points of the Schmitt trigger. Since multiple Schmitt trigger circuits can be provided by a single integrated circuit (e.g. the 4000 series CMOS device type 40106 contains 6 of them), a spare section of the IC can be quickly pressed into service as a simple and reliable oscillator with only two external components.

Here, a comparator-based Schmitt trigger is used in its inverting configuration. Additionally, slow negative feedback is added with an integrating RC network. The result, which is shown on the right, is that the output automatically oscillates from &quot;V&quot;&quot;SS&quot; to &quot;V&quot;&quot;DD&quot; as the capacitor charges from one Schmitt trigger threshold to the other.

<doc id="379244" wikidata="Q416589" url="?curid=379244" title="Maltase">
<text>Maltase is an informal name for a family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of disaccharide maltose into two simple sugars of glucose. Maltases are found in plants, bacteria, yeast, humans, and other vertebrates.

Digestion of starch requires six intestinal enzymes. Two of these enzymes are luminal endo-glucosidases named alpha-amylases. The other four enzymes have been identified as different maltases, exo-glucosidases bound to the luminal surface of enterocytes. Two of these maltase activities were associated with sucrase-isomaltase (maltase Ib, maltase Ia). The other two maltases with no distinguishing characteristics were named maltase-glucoamylase (maltases II and III). The activities of these four maltases are also described as alpha-glucosidase because they all digest linear starch oligosaccharides to glucose.

== Structure==

Maltases are members of a group of intestinal enzymes called FamilyGH13 (Glycoside hydrolase family 13) that are responsible for breaking apart the α-glucosidase linkages of complex carbohydrates into simple to use glucose molecules. The glucose molecules would then be used as a sort of &quot;food&quot; for cells to produce energy (Adenosine triphosphate) during Cellular respiration. The following are genes that can code for maltase:

* Acid alpha-glucosidase which is coded on the GAA gene is essential to breakdown complex sugars called Glycogen into glucose.
* Maltase-glucoamylase which is coded on the MGAM gene plays a role in the digestion of starches. It is due to this enzyme in humans that starches of plant origin are able to digested.
* Sucrase-isomaltase which is coded on the SI gene is essential for the digestion of carbohydrates including starch, sucrose and isomaltose.
*Alpha-amylase 1 which is coded on the AMY1A gene is responsible of cleaving α-glucosidase linkages in oligosaccharides and polysaccharides in order to produce starches and glycogen for the previous enzymes to catalyze. Higher quantities of this gene in the brain have been shown to lower the risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

== Mechanism ==

The mechanism of all FamilyGH13 enzymes is to break a α-glucosidase linkage by hydrolyzing it. Maltase focuses on breaking apart maltose, a disaccharide that is a link between 2 units of glucose, at the α-(1-&gt;4) bond. The rate of hydrolysis is controlled by the size of the substrate (carbohydrate size).

== Industrial applications ==
Alpha-amylase has an important function in degradation of starches, so it is used frequently in the baking industry. It is mostly used a means of flavor enhancing to improve bread quality. Without alpha-amylase, yeast would not be able to ferment.

Maltose-glucoamylase is commonly used as a fermentation source as it is able to cut starch into maltose, which is then used for brewing beers and sake.

Other than brewing, maltose glucoamylase has been studied by introducing specific inhibitors to stop the hydrolysis of the α-glucosidase linkages. By inhibiting the cleave of the linkages, scientists are hoping to devise a drug that is more efficient and less toxic to treating diabetes.

== History ==
The history of maltase discovery began when Napoleon Bonaparte declared a continental blockade in his “Berlin decree” in 1806. This initiated the search for alternative sources of sugar. In 1833 French chemists Anselm Payen and Jean-Francois Persoz discovered a malt extract that converted starch into glucose which they called diastase at the time. In 1880, H.T. Brown discovered mucosal maltase activity and differentiated it from diastase, now called amylase. In the 1960s advances in protein chemistry allowed Arne Dahlqvist and Giorgio Semenza to fractionate and characterize small intestinal maltase activities. Both groups showed there were four major fractions of maltase activity that were intrinsic to two different peptide structures, sucrase-isomaltase and maltase-glucoamylase. Fifty years later entering the genomic age, cloning and sequencing of the mucosal starch hydrolase confirmed Dahlqvist and Semenza&#x27;s findings.

== Maltase deficiency ==
Acid maltase deficiency (AMD) also known as Pompe disease was first described by Dutch pathologist JC Pompe in 1932. AMD is a non sex linked autosomal recessive condition in which excessive accumulation of glycogen build up within lysosome vacuoles in nearly all types of cells all over the body. It is one of the more serious glycogen storage diseases affecting muscle tissue.

AMD is categorized into three separate types based on the age of onset of symptoms in the affected individual. Infantile (Type a), childhood (Type b), and adulthood (Type c). The type of AMD is determined by the type of gene mutation localized on 17q23. Mutation type will determine production level of acid maltase. AMD is extremely fatal. Type a generally die of heart failure prior to age one. Type b die of respiratory failure between ages three to twenty-four. Type c die of respiratory failure 10–20 years of the onset of symptoms.

==Comparative physiology==
Vampire bats are the only vertebrates known to not exhibit intestinal maltase activity.

<doc id="379245" wikidata="Q4782808" url="?curid=379245" title="Aquatic respiration">
<text>Aquatic respiration is the process whereby an aquatic organism exchanges respiratory gases with water, obtaining oxygen from oxygen dissolved in water and excreting carbon dioxide and some other metabolic waste products into the water.

==Unicellular and simple small organisms==
In very small animals, plants and bacteria, simple diffusion of gaseous metabolites is sufficient for respiratory function and no special adaptations are found to aid respiration. Passive diffusion or active transport are also sufficient mechanisms for many larger aquatic animals such as many worms, jellyfish, sponges, bryozoans and similar organisms. In such cases, no specific respiratory organs or organelles are found.

==Higher plants==
Although higher plants typically use carbon dioxide and excrete oxygen during photosynthesis, they also respire and, particularly during darkness, many plants excrete carbon dioxide and require oxygen to maintain normal functions. In fully submerged aquatic higher plants specialised structures such as stoma on leaf surfaces to control gas interchange. In many species, these structures can be controlled to be open or closed depending on environmental conditions. In conditions of high light intensity and relatively high carbonate ion concentrations, oxygen may be produced in sufficient quantities to form gaseous bubbles on the surface of leaves and may produce oxygen super-saturation in the surrounding water body.

==Animals==
All animals that practice truly aquatic respiration are poikilothermic. All aquatic homeothermic animals and birds including cetaceans and penguins are air breathing despite a fully aquatic life-style.

===Echinoderms===
Echinoderms have a specialised water vascular system which provides a number of functions including providing the hydraulic power for tube feet but also serves to convey oxygenated sea water into the body and carry waste water out again. In many genera, the water enters through a madreporite, a sieve like structure on the upper surface but may also enter via ciliary action in the tube feet or via special cribiform organelles.

===Molluscs===

Molluscs commonly possess gills that allow exchange of respiratory gases from an aqueous environment into the circulatory system. These animals possess a heart that pumps blood which contains hemocyanin as its oxygen-capturing molecule. The respiratory system of gastropods can include either gills or a lung.

=== Arthropods ===

Aquatic arthropods generally possess some form of gills in which gas exchange takes place by diffusing through the exoskeleton. Others may breathe atmospheric air while remaining submerged, via breathing tubes or trapped air bubbles, though some aquatic insects may remain submerged indefinitely and respire using a plastron. A number of insects have an aquatic juvenile phase and an adult phase on land. In these case adaptions for life in water are lost at the final ecdysis. A number of orders of insects such as mayflies, caddis flies and stone flies have aquatic juvenile stages while some orders such as Lepidoptera have just a few examples such as China mark moths. A very few arachnids have adopted an aquatic life style including the diving bell spider. In all cases, oxygen is provided from air trapped by hairs around the animal&#x27;s body.

===Fish===

Most fish exchange gases using gills on either side of the pharynx (throat), forming the splanchnocranium, the portion of the skeleton where the cartilage of the cranium converges into the cartilage of the pharynx and its associated parts. Gills are tissues which consist of threadlike structures called filaments. These filaments have many functions and are involved in ion and water transfer as well as oxygen, carbon dioxide, acid and ammonia exchange. Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for the exchange of gases and ions. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In species like the spiny dogfish and other sharks and rays, a spiracle exists near the top of the head that pumps water into the gills when the animal is not in motion. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. The muscles on the sides of the pharynx push the oxygen-depleted water out the gill openings. In bony fish, the pumping of oxygen-poor water is aided by a bone that surrounds the gills called the operculum.

===Amphibians===

Both the lungs and the skin serve as respiratory organs in amphibians. The skin of these animals is highly vascularized and moist, with moisture maintained via secretion of mucus from specialized cells. While the lungs are of primary importance to breathing control, the unique properties of cutaneous respiration supplements rapid gas exchange when amphibians are submerged in oxygen-rich water.

===Aquatic reptiles, birds and mammals===

All aquatic amniotes (reptiles, birds and mammals) have thick and impermeable cutes that preclude cutaneous respiration, and thus rely solely on the lungs to breathe air. When underwater, the animal is essentially holding its breath and has to routinely return to the surface to breathe in new air. Therefore, all amniote animals, even those that spend more time in water than out, are susceptible to drowning if they cannot reach the surface to breath.

The anatomical structure of the lungs is less complex in reptiles than in mammals, with reptiles lacking the very extensive bronchial tree found in mammalian lungs. Gas exchange in reptiles still occurs in alveoli, but reptiles do not possess a diaphragm, therefore ventilation occurs via a change in the volume of the body cavity which is controlled by contraction of intercostal muscles in all reptiles except turtles. In turtles, contraction of specific pairs of flank muscles governs inspiration or expiration.

Diving birds and pelagic seabirds breath air using lungs like reptiles and mammals, but avian lungs are fairly rigid structures that do not expand and contract as elastically. Instead, the structures that act as bellows that ventilate the lungs are the avascular air sacs, which are distributed throughout much of the birds&#x27; bodies and move air &quot;unidirectionally&quot; through the parabronchi, where gas exchange happens. Although bird lungs are smaller than those of mammals of comparable size, the air sacs account for 15% of the total body volume, whereas in mammals, the alveoli (which act as the bellows) constitute only 7% of the total body volume. Like their reptilian cousins, birds also lack a diaphragm and thus rely on the intercostal and abdominal muscles to change the volume of the entire thoracoabdominal cavity. The active phase of respiration in birds is exhalation, which requires contracting of respiratory muscles, while the relaxation of these muscles causes inhalation.

==Gills==

Many aquatic animals have developed gills for respiration which are specifically adapted to their function. In fish, for example, they have:
*A large surface area to allow as much oxygen to enter the gills as possible because more of the gas comes into contact with the membrane
*Good blood supply to maintain the concentration gradient needed
*Thin membrane to allow for a short diffusion pathway
*Each gill arch has two rows (hemibranchs) of gill filaments
*Each gill filament has many lamellae
In osteichthyes, the gills contain 4 gill arches on each side of the head, two on each side for chondrichthyes or seven gill baskets on each side of the fish&#x27;s head in lampreys.
In fish, the long bony cover for the gill (the operculum) can be used for pushing water. Some fish pump water using the operculum. Without an operculum, other methods, such as ram ventilation, are required. Some species of sharks use this system. When they swim, water flows into the mouth and across the gills. Because these sharks rely on this technique, they must keep swimming in order to respire.

Bony fish use countercurrent flow to maximize the intake of oxygen that can diffuse through the gill. Countercurrent flow occurs when deoxygenated blood moves through the gill in one direction while oxygenated water moves through the gill in the opposite direction. This mechanism maintains the concentration gradient thus increasing the efficiency of the respiration process as well and prevents the oxygen levels from reaching an equilibrium. Cartilaginous fish do not have a countercurrent flow system as they lack bones which are needed to have the opened out gill that bony fish have.

==Control of respiration==
In fish neurons located in the brainstem of fish are responsible for the genesis of the respiratory rhythm. The position of these neurons is slightly different from the centers of respiratory genesis in mammals but they are located in the same brain compartment, which has caused debates about the homology of respiratory centers between aquatic and terrestrial species. In both aquatic and terrestrial respiration, the exact mechanisms by which neurons can generate this involuntary rhythm are still not completely understood (see Involuntary control of respiration).

The respiratory rhythm is modulated to adapt to the oxygen consumption of the body. As observed in mammals, fish “breathe” faster and heavier when they do physical exercise. The mechanisms by which these changes occur have been subject to debate . The views can be classified as either that the major part of the respiratory changes are pre-programmed in the brain, which would imply that neurons from locomotion centers of the brain connect to respiratory centers in anticipation of movements, or that the major part of the respiratory changes result from the detection of muscle contraction, and that respiration is adapted as a consequence of muscular contraction and oxygen consumption. The latter view would imply that the brain possesses some kind of detection mechanisms that would trigger a respiratory response when muscular contraction occurs.

Many now agree that both mechanisms are probably present and complementary, or working alongside a mechanism that can detect changes in oxygen and/or carbon dioxide blood saturation.

<doc id="379250" wikidata="Q939044" url="?curid=379250" title="Shell Centre">
<text>The Shell Centre in London is the global headquarters of oil major Shell plc. It is located on Belvedere Road in the London Borough of Lambeth. It is a prominent feature on the South Bank of the River Thames near County Hall, and now forms the backdrop to the London Eye.

The original Shell Centre comprised the tower building and three now-demolished adjoining nine-storey wings (collectively formerly known as the &quot;Upstream Building&quot;). The original development also included the &quot;Downstream Building&quot;, which had the same nine-storey slab block form but was separated from the Upstream Building by the railway viaduct between Charing Cross and Waterloo East.

Since 2004/05, a New Year 60-second countdown has been projected onto the Shell Centre at 11:59pm every New Year&#x27;s Eve 
 as part of the Mayor of London&#x27;s fireworks celebrations centred on the stretch of the Thames in front of the London Eye.

The Downstream Building was disposed of by Shell in the 1990s. It has been heightened by one storey and is now a block of residential apartments known as the Whitehouse Apartments.

==Site history and layout==
The Shell Centre occupies part of the site cleared for the 1951 Festival of Britain. The areas closer to the River Thames now include Jubilee Gardens and the South Bank Centre. Jubilee Gardens remained undeveloped prior to its laying out as an open space, largely because of a restrictive covenant in favour of Shell that restricts any building on the part of the site directly between the Shell Tower and the River Thames.

The naming of the Shell Centre buildings perpetuated the split of the Festival site into distinct Upstream and Downstream areas, separated by the railway viaduct approach to Hungerford Bridge.

During construction, parts of abandoned works for the Waterloo and Whitehall Railway were discovered. This was a prototype for a proposed pneumatic railway that would have run under the River Thames linking Waterloo and Charing Cross. Digging was started in 1865, but was stopped in 1868, due to financial problems.

Visible in the Thames at low tide just in line with the tower as water turbulence at one point a few feet into the river bed is the outflow point of the Shell Centre&#x27;s air conditioning system, which sucks in river water from just outside County Hall and sends it via a pipe within a bolt iron tunnel (built exactly like a tube railway tunnel), to a point convergent with the outfall, beyond which both the intake pipe and the outflow pipes continue under the embankment and Jubilee Gardens to the basement of the tower.

From here the water is sent through filters and heat exchangers to provide cooled air in the building. The pipes had to be specially supported on adjustable jacks, during excavation work for the extension of the Jubilee line in 1995, because of settlement during the driving of an access tunnel out from Jubilee Gardens, to the main running lines in York Road via Chicheley Street.

==Architecture and design==

The choice of Portland Stone cladding, and bronze framed individual upright windows were denounced by Modern Movement critics, and the centre&#x27;s buildings have generally been regarded as dull. However, the extremely traditional cladding has meant that the buildings have weathered better than most of their contemporaries with concrete or aggregate faced façades or curtain wall glazing.

The original interiors were luxuriously appointed, and as well as contributions from a British design team (many of whom had worked on the Festival of Britain), they included work by Ernesto Nathan Rogers who had worked on the Torre Velasca in Milan. Facilities for staff were lavish by the standards of the time, and the basement of the building was designed with a full size swimming pool and a spacious gymnasium.

The basement also originally housed a rifle range, snooker room, a small supermarket for staff and a host of other facilities. Until 1998, there was also a fully equipped theatre (designed by Cecil Beaton) which – unusually for a space dedicated to amateur productions – had full fly tower facilities.

The courtyard of the Upstream Building included two notable sculptures:
* &quot;Torsion Fountain&quot; (also known as The Shell Fountain) by Franta Belsky is a tall bronze column of shell like forms, which once poured water into one another; and
* &quot;Motorcyclist&quot; by Siegfried Charoux – a larger than life figure of a rider astride his machine.

The public realm of the Upstream Building was steadily degraded over the years, with the generous space between the columns of the entrance from York Road enclosed to enlarge the foyers. Textured paving in contrasting colours was installed to assist partially sighted pedestrians navigate the complex steps and ramps of the site, but also served to deter rough sleepers and skateboarders.

==Construction==
The Shell Centre was constructed by Sir Robert McAlpine between 1957 and 1962, to a design by Sir Howard Robertson, and the tower stands at with 27 storeys (26 numbered and a mezzanine level) and extends three storeys below ground. The tower was the first London office tower to exceed the height of the Victoria Tower of the Palace of Westminster.

It replaced the Midland Grand Hotel as the tallest storied building in London, and the Royal Liver Building as the tallest in the United Kingdom. On completion the building also held the record for the largest office building, by floor space, in Europe.

==Functions and occupation of the buildings==

In addition to being the headquarters for the group, it also acts as the main offices of the following Shell businesses; refining and marketing, along with a number of functional support activities such as finance and human resources. The Shell Centre is also the head office of Shell&#x27;s United Kingdom business (Shell UK Ltd.), which was formerly located in Shell Mex House.

==Redevelopment of the Upstream Building==
In 2004, a planning application was approved to convert the lower floors of the Upstream Building courtyard and the former staff cafeteria into a shopping centre, and to construct a contrasting new glazed office building on the Podium Site to the south, which was then a paved open space above underground car parking. 

In July 2011, Shell announced that a joint venture of Canary Wharf Group and Qatari Diar had bought a virtual freehold (a 999-year lease) on the Shell Centre for £300m, and would redevelop the site. The tower was to be left in place, but the rest of the site was replaced by a new scheme of offices, shops and restaurants. The new development is called Southbank Place.

The 9-storey ranges of the Upstream Building have now been replaced by a cluster of new predominantly glazed towers around the original Shell tower. They are considerably taller than the earlier buildings, but are all lower than the Shell Tower.

The staff amenities of the swimming pool and theatre in the basements have not been re-provided in the new development.

The Charoux &#x27;Motorcyclist&#x27; sculpture was reinstated on the Chicheley Street side of the development in May 2019 but (as at April 2024) Franta Belsky&#x27;s &#x27;Shell Fountain&#x27; has not yet been re-erected.

<doc id="379251" wikidata="Q3973342" url="?curid=379251" title="Steve Hansgen">
<text>Steve Hansgen is an American musician from Washington, D.C. He is best known as a member of the hardcore punk band Minor Threat. He also played briefly in the D.C. hardcore band Government Issue, and joined Youth Brigade for their short reunion in 2012.

==Career==
===Early days and Minor Threat (1980–1983)===
Hansgen became involved in the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene in the early 1980s. He joined Minor Threat as bass guitarist in August 1982 when original bassist Brian Baker, Hansgen&#x27;s childhood friend, switched to second guitar. Hansgen appeared on the &quot;Out of Step&quot; LP and toured extensively with the band over the next year. He left Minor Threat in 1983 when its founding members decided to return the band to its original configuration, a few months before their breakup.

===Second Wind, Government Issue (1983–1989)===
Hansgen formed Second Wind with Minor Threat roadie Rich Moore in 1984. They released the &quot;Security&quot; 12&quot; record later that year. In 1984, he was also a roadie for the reformed Meatmen.

Hansgen played bass in Government Issue in 1986. He appears on several tracks on their 1986 self-titled LP. He left the band later that year.

===Work in production and Emmapeel (1990–1999)===
In the 1990s, Hansgen continued to work as an engineer and producer. Notably, he worked with Tool on their first demo tape and EP, &quot;Opiate&quot; (1992).

He played bass around this time in Emmapeel with Government Issue vocalist John Stabb. Emmapeel released the &quot;Avenging Punk Rock Godfathers&quot; 7&quot; in 1993.

===Middle Aged Brigade, Youth Brigade reunion, other later activity (2000–present)===
In 2003, Baker and Hansgen began playing in the side project Middle Aged Brigade, with whom they recorded some demos. The band was active sporadically in the years that followed. In 2009, Steve Hansgen joined Mike Dolfi, Boyd Farrell (both from Black Market Baby) and Phil Ricche (of The Intentions) in the band Rustbuckit.

On 29 December 2012, Hansgen reunited with three original members of the seminal DC hardcore band Youth Brigade, vocalist Nathan Strejcek (formerly of seminal band Teen Idles), drummer Danny Ingram and bassist Bert Quieroz for a show at the Washington, D.C. club The Black Cat. The show was a benefit for the D.C. hardcore documentary &quot;Salad Days&quot; and also featured Scream and Government Issue. That same foursome continued as Youth Brigade and did a second show at the 9:30 Club shortly thereafter as part of the &quot;Punk-Funk Throwdown&quot; series.

Hansgen later played in Dot Dash.

<text>Aquatic insects or water insects live some portion of their life cycle in the water. They feed in the same ways as other insects. Some &quot;diving&quot; insects, such as predatory diving beetles, can hunt for food underwater where land-living insects cannot compete.

==Breathing==
One problem that aquatic insects must overcome is how to get oxygen while they are under water. Almost all animals require a source of oxygen to live. Insects draw air into their bodies through spiracles, holes found along the sides of the abdomen. These spiracles are connected to tracheal tubes where oxygen can be absorbed. All aquatic insects have become adapted to their environment with the specialization of these structures
;Aquatic adaptations
# Simple diffusion over a relatively thin integument
# Temporary use of an air bubble
# Extraction of oxygen from water using a plastron or blood gill 
# Storage of oxygen in hemoglobin and hemocyanin molecules in hemolymph
# Taking oxygen from surface via breathing tubes (siphons)

The nymphs of the hemimetabolous orders mayflies, dragonflies and stoneflies, and the larvae of the holometabolous orders megalopterans and caddisflies, possess tracheal gills, which are outgrowths of the body wall containing a dense network of tracheae covered by a thin cuticle through which oxygen in the water can diffuse. 

Some insects have densely packed hairs (setae) around the spiracles that allow air to remain near, while keeping water away from, the body. The trachea open through spiracles into this air film, allowing access to oxygen. In many such cases, when the insect dives into the water, it carries a layer of air over parts of its surface, and breathes using this trapped air bubble until it is depleted, then returns to the surface to repeat the process. Other types of insects have a plastron or physical gill that can be various combinations of hairs, scales, and undulations projecting from the cuticle, which hold a thin layer of air along the outer surface of the body. In these insects, the volume of the film is small enough, and their respiration slow enough, that diffusion from the surrounding water is enough to replenish the oxygen in the pocket of air as fast as it is used. The large proportion of nitrogen in the air dissolves in water slowly and maintains the gas volume, supporting oxygen diffusion. Insects of this type only rarely need to replenish their supply of air. 

Other aquatic insects can remain under water for long periods due to high concentrations of hemoglobin in their hemolymph circulating freely within their body. Hemoglobin bonds strongly to oxygen molecules. 

A few insects such as water scorpions and mosquito larvae have breathing tubes (&quot;siphons&quot;) with the opening surrounded by hydrofuge hairs, allowing them to breathe without having to leave the water.

==Orders with aquatic or semiaquatic species==
*Collembola - springtails (which are not technically insects, but are closely related)
*Ephemeroptera - mayflies
*Odonata - dragonflies and damselflies
*Plecoptera - stoneflies
*Megaloptera - alderflies, fishflies, and dobsonflies
*Neuroptera - lacewings
*Coleoptera - beetles
*Hemiptera - true bugs (water striders, giant water bugs)
*Hymenoptera - ants (e.g. &quot;Polyrhachis sokolova&quot;) and wasps (e.g. &quot;Microgaster godzilla&quot;)
*Diptera - flies
*Mecoptera - scorpionflies
*Lepidoptera - moths
*Trichoptera - caddisflies

EPT insects, an acronym for Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies), are sensitive to pollutants and are used as an indicator of water quality in streams, rivers and lakes.

== Marine aquatic insects ==
Aquatic insects live mostly in freshwater habitats, and there are very few marine insect species. The only true examples of pelagic insects are the sea skaters, which belongs to the order Hemiptera, and there are a few types of insects that live in the intertidal zone, including larvae of caddisflies from the family Chathamiidae, the hemipteran &quot;Aepophilus bonnairei&quot;, and a few other taxa.

<doc id="379256" wikidata="Q316139" url="?curid=379256" title="Battle of Oudenarde">
<text>The Battle of Oudenarde, also known as the Battle of Oudenaarde, was a major engagement of the War of the Spanish Succession, pitting an Anglo-Dutch force consisting of eighty thousand men under the command of the Duke of Marlborough, Lord Overkirk and Prince Eugene of Savoy against a French force of eighty-five thousand men under the command of the Duc de Bourgogne and the Duc de Vendôme, the battle resulting in a great victory for the Grand Alliance. The battle was fought near the city of Oudenaarde, at the time part of the Spanish Netherlands, on 11 July 1708. With this victory, the Grand Alliance ensured the fall of various French territories, giving them a significant strategic and tactical advantage during this stage of the war. The battle was fought in the later years of the war, a conflict that had come about as a result of English, Dutch and Habsburg apprehension at the possibility of a Bourbon succeeding the deceased King of Spain, Charles II, and combining their two nations and empires into one.

The engagement itself came about after a series of offensive and defensive manoeuvres between an Allied army under the command of Marlborough and a French army under the command of the Duc de Bourgogne. The two French commanders quarrelled about the direction their army should take, although roughly a month before the battle, the French army moved westwards and captured the Allied-held fortresses of Bruges and Ghent. This proved to be an unexpected and worrying action to Marlborough, who waited until Eugene had joined his army before he decided to undertake any offensive operations. The French moved to attack again, aiming to capture the city of Oudenarde, which would cut off communication and supply routes between Marlborough and England and thus allow for a significant victory over the Grand Alliance. Marlborough managed to figure out the French plan of action, and forced marched his men towards Oudenaarde to defend it from the expected French attack. On 11 July, the two forces met near the city.

During the engagement, Allied cavalry moved to engage the French forward positions, killing or capturing many soldiers and pushing them back. For unknown reasons, a significant portion of the French army kept in reserve was never ordered to move up and engage, thus leading to a significantly weakened force facing the Allies. The infantry battalions on both sides moved to engage each other, with skilled deployment of cavalry by Cadogan ensuring the rout of many of the French infantry battalions, weakening their positions. Both sides settled into an engagement on opposing sides of the river, with several further mostly fruitless cavalry charges attempted by both sides. Marlborough initiated a flanking manoeuvre, gaining the allies a significant tactical and strategic advantage. Faced with mounting casualties, the French commanders made the decision to withdraw from the field. The battle was the third major victory that Marlborough had obtained during the war, boosting his military renown alongside that of Eugene, whose tactical contributions were vital to this victory.

==Background==

The War of the Spanish Succession, fought from 1701 to 1714, was a European conflict in the early 18th century, triggered by the death of the childless Charles II of Spain in November 1700, the last Habsburg monarch of Spain. His closest heirs were members of the Austrian Habsburg and French Bourbon families; acquisition of an undivided Spanish Empire by either threatened the European balance of power and thus the other leading powers became involved. Charles bequeathed an undivided monarchy of Spain to his grandnephew Philip, who was also grandson of Louis XIV of France. Philip was proclaimed King of Spain on 16 November 1700. Disputes over territorial and commercial rights led to war in 1701 between the Bourbons of France and Spain and the Grand Alliance, whose candidate was Charles, younger son of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. The primary opponents of the Bourbon succession were the Kingdom of England (later the Kingdom of Great Britain after the Acts of Union with Scotland), the Holy Roman Empire and the Dutch Republic. In addition, many Spaniards opposed the idea of a Bourbon ruling Spain, and threw their lot in with Charles. Initially, the war went favourably for the French, given their vast army and navy and extremely advantageous geopolitical position. However, crushing defeats at Blenheim and Ramillies caused the war to settle into a stalemate, as the forces of the Grand Alliance could not advance into French territory, nor could the French advance into Habsburg territories either.

As the French army moved closer to the border with the Spanish Netherlands in 1708, the two French commanders began quarrelling over which battle plan they should adopt. Vendôme wished to attack the city of Huy, which could draw Marlborough in pursuit of his forces and weaken the overall allied position. The eventual plan adopted, however (under direct orders from Louis XIV), was to attack Flanders. The French army moved eastward, until they reached the city of Braine-l&#x27;Alleud, which was about twenty-five kilometres south of Brussels, and allowed the French to threaten the nearby city of Leuven. Marlborough moved his forces to a few miles south of Leuven, in order to sufficiently protect both cities from a potential French assault. The French army then remained inactive for more than a month, not making any major movements whatsoever. This allowed the much-delayed Eugène to bring his forces across the Rhine and head towards Marlboroughs position. On 5 July, however, the French unexpectedly moved westward, quickly capturing the cities of Bruges and Ghent (although about three hundred British soldiers held out in Ghent for a few days). This unexpected move both demoralised and confounded Marlborough and his army, and he did not make any offensive moves until Eugène along with his army arrived to join him. The French army had control over the entire length of the Scheldt from the French border to the newly taken city of Ghent.

Only one Allied fortress remained: the city of Oudenaarde. If the French managed to capture that city, Marlborough&#x27;s army would be cut off from the coast, causing them to lose communication with England. Marlborough managed to guess the French battle plan, and also correctly guessed the method by which the French army would attempt to take Oudenarde—they would march down the east bank of the Scheldt (closer to Marlborough&#x27;s troops), while leaving a large covering force between the two opposing armies. The French army set out on 8 July, marching toward the city of Lessines. However, Marlborough made one of the most impressive forced marches in history, capturing the city on 10 July. This forced the French commanders to attempt to simply to wade across the Scheldt and take Oudenaarde from that position. Marlborough again ordered a forced march of his troops. This time, though, he ordered eleven thousand troops to hold the main crossing point across the Scheldt, under the command of his Quartermaster General, William Cadogan. Cadogan&#x27;s force built five additional pontoon bridges to allow Marlborough to get his eighty-thousand-strong army across the river, until French foragers discovered the allied presence around 9:00 a.m., initiating the battle.

==Battle==
Cadogan, a superb cavalry commander, ordered some dragoons under the command of Danish general Jørgen Rantzau to capture men from the French advance guard. Many of those troops managed to escape and alerted Lieutenant General Charles-Armand de Gontaut, duc de Biron, who commanded the French vanguard to the presence of Allied troops on the west bank. When de Biron advanced, he was disagreeably surprised by the large number of Allied cavalry already across the river, along with the approaching Allied infantry. Although he was ordered to attack by Vendôme, he hesitated upon seeing the reinforced line of twenty infantry battalions (including the four that had been left to guard the pontoon bridges). Biron&#x27;s own forces comprised only seven infantry battalions and twenty cavalry squadrons. He had been given reliable advice that cavalry could not negotiate the marshy terrain in the area and decided not to attempt a crossing. At this time, Eugène, along with twenty squadrons of Prussian cavalry, moved across the river and occupied crucial positions. While Biron&#x27;s troops were manoeuvring, the leading British infantry brigade had arrived, under the command of John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll. Cadogan, given authority from Marlborough, attacked Biron&#x27;s seven infantry battalions of Swiss mercenaries with his division (consisting mainly of cavalry). The isolated Swiss mercenaries were immediately pushed back and the Allied force destroyed Biron&#x27;s units, until they reached a large mass of French cavalry, at which point they were forced to retire, outnumbered. The force which performed this action was Rantzau&#x27;s cavalry, with the future King George II among them.

Burgundy, making another mistake, decided to launch an attack, over protests by Vendôme. The French right wing began to attack the Allied positions near Eine, while the left wing, for unknown reasons, remained stationary near Huise. A very strong position was held by the Allied left wing. Twenty-eight cavalry squadrons protected the right flank of Cadogan&#x27;s infantry, which would receive the attack, which proceeded at about 4:00 p.m.. Burgundy ordered the assault, which landed on Prussian cavalry squadrons under Dubislav Gneomar von Natzmer. Although intense fighting ensued, the attack was dispersed. Then, Vendôme made a dubious tactical decision to personally lead an attack of twelve infantry regiments, fighting hand-to-hand with a half-pike. This meant that while one commander (Burgundy) was in his headquarters with no view of the ongoing battle, the other commander was personally fighting in the field, with no possibility of directing his men. Most historians agree that had the French left wing attacked the weakened Allied right wing, it would have been forced to retreat. Vendôme realized this, asking Burgundy for permission to attack with the left wing. Burgundy sent back a messenger with a message of refusal but the messenger failed to deliver the message. The situation worsened with Vendôme believing that support would arrive for his troops, who were lengthening their line of battle and threatening to envelop the Allied left flank. As French infantry regiments approached, they lengthened the Allied line but too slowly and not great enough in extent to prevent the French from threatening the Allied positions.

Around this same time, the Dutch field deputies Sicco van Goslinga and Adolf Hendrik van Rechteren were moving near where Marlborough was leading the action. They noted, rightly or wrongly, that he made an unsteady and indecisive impression, presumably as a result of an accident he had had the previous night. He had then fallen into a deep ditch with his horse and had been trapped under the animal. Together the two field deputies decided to ask Eugene, who had so far remained in the background, to intervene and assume supreme command. After some urging, as he was not in the service of either of the Maritime Powers, he replied: &#x27;Well now gentlemen, ... I will do what you ask of me.&#x27; 

Marlborough thus moved his headquarters to the left flank, while Eugène assumed command of the right flank, which still checked the left wing of the French army. While the right wing was under pressure, Marlborough placed eighteen newly arrived Hessian and Hanoverian infantry battalions in the left flank to replace twenty of Prussian General Carl von Lottum&#x27;s battalions, ordered them to move to support Eugène&#x27;s men. This moved fresh troops to the critical Allied left flank, while reinforcing the Allied right flank and allowing Lottum&#x27;s troops to be granted a vital rest. Marlborough then began formulating a new plan of double encirclement. He had now under his command 25,000 fresh troops of the Dutch Army, under Field Marshal Hendrik Overkirk, an experienced military officer and ordered them to flank the French right wing. Overkirk was unable to cross the collapsed pontoon bridges near Oudenaarde, forcing him to use the stone bridges in the city, delaying him for an hour. Marlborough went ahead with his plan, having Eugène&#x27;s cavalry charge towards Burgundy&#x27;s headquarters. The French Household Cavalry, the Maison du Roi, were only just able to turn them back and Marlborough, with only the eighteen Hessian and Hanoverian battalions, was unable to do much other than keep the French right in check. At about 18:00, Overkirk&#x27;s troops had arrived and were in a position to flank the French right wing. This was in conjunction with a dual attack by Marlborough and Eugène.

Overkirk had sent his two leading infantry brigades under Major General Coenraad Weck through a gap in the woodlands to strengthen Marlborough’s left, while he himself had made a circumferential move, more to the left, with the rest of his troops. However, Eugene became concerned about the left wing and sent the two field deputies there with orders to attack the French. Arriving there, Sicco van Goslinga discovered an exhausted Overkirk. According to Van Goslinga the old general did not seem to see the urgency of an attack. Unsatisfied, Van Goslinga then rode off to a line of six battalions where he encountered Lieutenant General Bengt Oxenstierna. He too had no intention of attacking, arguing that the terrain was too rugged to pass through and that they were better off waiting for the French. Van Goslinga then decided to take it upon himself to launch the attack and he placed himself at the head of two Swiss battalions which he ordered to advance. Five other Dutch battalions followed and the Prince of Orange placed eight others alongside Van Goslinga in battle order. The Deputy and the young Prince marched down the slope with roughly 10,000 infantrymen and crashed into the French infantry, whom they quickly swept aside. A French counter-attack by the elite horsemen of the Maison du Roi did little to change the situation. At the same time, the Dutch cavalry under the Count of Tilly cut off the French retreat route to Kortrijk. Much of the French army was routed or captured, with lack of daylight preventing the completion of the manoeuvre. The battle also ended in confusion for the Allies. The darkness caused their right and left wings to mistake each other for the enemy and they began firing at each other. Eugene on the right and the Prince of Orange on the left managed, through their intervention, to stop the firing and prevented the army from doing any real damage to itself.

==Aftermath==
The French army retreated in disorder towards Ghent, with the Duc de Bourgogne and the Duc de Vendome quarreling amongst themselves on who was to blame for the defeat. Only nightfall and a few broken pontoon bridges saved the French army from total annihilation. For unknown reasons, about half of the total forces the French had at their disposal during the battle were kept in reserve, never being called up to participate in the battle. There was a great mass of French cavalry and infantry in some raised ground north of the Norken River along with many of Burgundy&#x27;s troops that remained inactive in the battle and did not advance forwards to assist their fellow Frenchmen, even when the tactical situation had turned against them with the arrival of Overkirk&#x27;s Dutch troops. Many of the French cavalry squadrons had remained in reserve, mainly because of the advice that they had been given of the ground before them being impassable by their horses.

The French commanders had made several catastrophic tactical errors during the battle: The entire French left wing (the troops under Burgundy and the large mass north of the Norken) was kept in reserve. They could easily have destroyed the weakened right wing of the Allied army. Had a concerted attack been carried out, with Vendôme attacking with his main body to envelop the Allied right flank and Bourgogne attacked with the left wing (before Overkirk and the rest of Argyll&#x27;s troops arrived), the French army could have easily won. The decision of Vendôme to march personally into battle may have provided a welcome boost to French morale, but it denied him for the rest of the battle the opportunity to command his troops, which proved disastrous when the Allies overwhelmed the French via a flanking manoeuvre. The French army had lost about fourteen to fifteen thousand soldiers overall (with about eight thousand of whom becoming prisoners-of-war) and twenty-five artillery guns, while the Allies lost roughly three thousand men. Bodart gives roughly similar numbers for the French casualties (6,000 killed or wounded and 8,000 captured), but higher numbers for allied ones (6,000 killed or wounded).

On the other hand, the reputation of the Allied commanders were greatly enhanced by the victory. For Marlborough, his eye for choosing the correct ground, his sense of timing and his keen knowledge of the enemy were again amply demonstrated. Eugene&#x27;s reputation was also enhanced—while Marlborough remained in overall command, Eugene had led the crucial right flank and centre. Once again the Allied commanders had co-operated remarkably well. &quot;Prince Eugene and I,&quot; wrote the Duke, &quot;shall never differ about our share of the laurels.&quot; The success restored the strategic initiative to the Allies, who now opted to besiege Lille, the strongest fortress in Europe. While the Duke commanded the covering force, Eugene oversaw the siege of the town, which surrendered on 22 October. However, it was not until 10 December that the resolute Boufflers yielded the citadel. Yet for all the difficulties of the winter siege, the campaign of 1708 had been a remarkable success by requiring superior logistical skill and organisation. The Allies reppelled an Assault on Brussels, retook Brughes and Ghent, and the French were driven out of almost all the Spanish Netherlands: &quot;He who has not seen this&quot;, wrote Eugene, &quot;has seen nothing&quot;.

<doc id="379257" wikidata="Q3022204" url="?curid=379257" title="Damselfish">
<text>Damselfish are those within the subfamilies Abudefdufinae, Chrominae, Lepidozyginae, Pomacentrinae, and Stegastinae within the family Pomacentridae. Most species within this group are relatively small, with the largest species being about 30cm (12 in) in length. Most damselfish species exist only in marine environments, but a few inhabit brackish or fresh water. These fish are found globally in tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters.

==Habitat==
 in tropical rocky or coral reefs, and many of those are kept as marine aquarium pets. Their diets include small crustaceans, plankton, and algae. However, a few live in fresh and brackish waters, such as the freshwater damselfish, or in warm subtropical climates, such as the large orange Garibaldi, which inhabits the coast of southern California and the Pacific Mexican coast.

==Foraging==

The domino damselfish &quot;D. albisella&quot; spends the majority (greater than 85%) of its daytime hours foraging. Larger individuals typically forage higher in a water column than do smaller ones. Damselfish of all sizes feed primarily on caridea and copepods. Males have relatively smaller stomach sizes during spawning season compared to females due to the allocation of resources for courtship and the guarding of nests. When current speeds are low, the damselfish forages higher in a water column where the flux of plankton is greater and they have a larger food source. As current speeds increase, it forages closer to the bottom of the column. Feeding rates tend to be higher when currents are faster. Smaller fishes forage closer to their substrates than do larger ones, possibly in response to predation pressures.

==Territoriality==
There are many examples of resource partitioning and habitat selection that are driven by aggressive and territorial behaviors in this group. For example, the threespot damselfish &quot;S. planifrons&quot; is very defensive of its territory and is a classic example of extreme territoriality within the group. One species, the dusky damselfish &quot;S. adustus&quot; spends the majority of its life within its territory.

==Domestication of mysid shrimps==

Longfin damselfish (&quot;Stegastes diencaeus&quot;) around Carrie Bow Cay, Belize (16°48.15′N, 88°04.95′W), have been shown to actively protect planktonic mysids (&quot;Mysidium integrum&quot;) in their reef farms. The mysids fertilize the algae grown in the reef farms with their excretes which in turn helps the damselfish who feed on algae to be healthier. In the reef farms that house mysids, damselfish aggressively defends the farm area against other fish that would prey on the mysids, significantly more so than they do when their farms do not house mysid shrimps. These damselfish would eat similar small invertebrates. Despite that, they are docile towards mysid shrimp. In the area, mysid shrimps are not found in swarms except in the farms maintained by damselfish. All these observations point to a pet-like relationship between the mysid shrimps and longfin damselfish in the area, with damselfish being the domesticator and mysids being the domesticate.

==Courtship==
In the species &quot;S. partitus&quot;, females do not choose to mate with males based on size. Even though large male size can be advantageous in defending nests and eggs against conspecifics among many animals, nest intrusions are not observed in this damselfish species. Females also do not choose their mates based upon the brood sizes of the males. In spite of the increased male parental care, brood size does not affect egg survival, as eggs are typically taken during the night when the males are not defending their nests. Rather, female choice of mates is dependent on male courtship rate. Males signal their parental quality by the vigor of their courtship displays, and females mate preferentially with vigorously courting males.

Male damselfish perform a courtship behavior called the signal jump, in which they rise in a water column and then rapidly swim back downward. The signal jump involves large amounts of rapid swimming, and females choose mates based on the vigor with which males do so. Females determine the male courtship rates using sounds that are produced during signal jumps. As the male damselfish swims down the water column, it creates a pulsed sound. Male courtship varies in the number and rates of those pulses.

In the beaugregory damselfish &quot;S. leucostictus&quot; males spend more time courting females that are larger in size. Female size is significantly correlated with ovary weight, and males intensify their courtship rituals for the more fecund females. Research has shown that males that mate with larger females do indeed receive and hatch greater numbers of eggs.

==Mating==
Male bicolor damselfish, &quot;E. partitus&quot;, exhibit polygamy, often courting multiple females simultaneously. Among this species, evolutionary selection favors those males that begin mating as soon as possible during spawning seasons even if the most favorable egg clutches are spawned at later times. Females often choose which males to mate with depending on the males’ territory quality. Shelter sites are essential for the bicolor damselfish in avoiding predation, and females may evaluate the suitability of these sites at a male territory before depositing their eggs.

===Effect of distance on spawning===
In the species &quot;S. nigricans&quot;, females usually mate with a single male each morning during spawning seasons. At dawn, they visit males’ territories to spawn. The distance to the territory of a mate influences the number of visits that a female engages in with a male. At short distances, females make many repeated visits. At longer ones, they may spawn their entire clutch in one visit. This plasticity in mating behavior can be attributed to two factors: (1) intrusions by other fish to feed in the females’ territories while they are away, which could make the females return frequently to their habitats in order to defend their resources, and (2) predatory attacks on the females, which increase in frequency as the distances that the females travel become longer. Intrusion by other fish into a female’s territory can diminish the habitat of its food and render it unstable. Thus, a spawning female should return to its home as often as possible. However, a greater number of spawning visits increases the chance of being attacked, especially when mating with males that are far away. To minimize overall costs, females change their number of spawning visits depending on male territory distance.

==Filial cannibalism==
The male cortez damselfish, &quot;S. rectifraenum&quot;, is known to engage in filial cannibalism. Studies have shown it typically consumes over twenty-five percent of its clutches. The males generally consume clutches that are smaller than average in size, as well as those that are still in the early stages of development. Female cortez damselfish tend to deposit their eggs with males who are already caring for early-stage eggs, rather than males with late-stage eggs. This preference is seen particularly in females that deposit smaller-sized clutches, which are more vulnerable to being consumed. For the males, filial cannibalism is an adaptive response to clutches that do not provide enough benefits to warrant the costs of parental care.

<doc id="379258" wikidata="Q1075549" url="?curid=379258" title="Choanocyte">
<text>Choanocytes (also known as &quot;collar cells&quot;) are cells that line the interior of asconoid, syconoid and leuconoid body types of sponges that contain a central flagellum, or &quot;cilium,&quot; surrounded by a collar of microvilli which are connected by a thin membrane. 

They make up the choanoderm, a type of cell layer found in sponges. The cell has the closest resemblance to the choanoflagellates which are the closest related single celled protists to the animal kingdom (metazoans). The flagellae beat regularly, creating a water flow across the microvilli which can then filter nutrients from the water taken from the collar of the sponge. Food particles are then phagocytosed by the cell. 

Choanocytes are found dotting the surface of the spongocoel in asconoid sponges and the radial canals in syconoid sponges, but they comprise entirely the chambers in leuconoid sponges.

==Morphology==
==Function==
By cooperatively moving their flagella, choanocytes filter particles out of the water and into the spongocoel, and out through the osculum. This improves both respiratory and digestive functions for the sponge, pulling in oxygen and nutrients and allowing a rapid expulsion of carbon dioxide and other waste products. Although all cells in a sponge are capable of living on their own, choanocytes carry out most of the sponge&#x27;s ingestion, passing digested materials to the amoebocytes for delivery to other cells.

Choanocytes can also turn into spermatocytes when needed for sexual reproduction, due to the lack of reproductive organs in sponges (amoebocytes become the oocytes).

==Evolutionary significance==
Choanocytes bear a superficial resemblance to Choanoflagellates. Molecular phylogenies indicate that choanoflagellates and metazoans are sister groups. One can see some modern choanoflagellates living in small colonies. The evolutionary relationship between the two cell types is debated.

<text>Orio Mastropiero (died 13 June 1192), forename sometimes rendered as Aurio and surname as Malipiero, was a Venetian statesman who served as the Doge of Venice from 1178 to 1192.
He was elected by the Council of Forty in 1178 following the retirement of Sebastiano Ziani. Prior to this he had been an ambassador to Sicily in 1175, tasked with drawing up a treaty with King William II. He had also been the electors&#x27; first choice for doge following the death of Vitale II Michiel in 1172, but stepped aside in favour of Ziani, an older and wealthier man.

His time in office was mostly unremarkable, apart from a revolt against Venetian rule in Zara, supported by King Béla III of Hungary. For a long while Venice remained passive, being in financial difficulty, but took action at last in 1187 or 1188 when, having secured loans from the Venetian nobility, Mastropiero launched a siege against the Zaratines. This was short-lived, however, owing to an order from Pope Gregory VIII that their warring cease immediately: the Third Crusade was about to begin and Christian soldiers would be required in plenty.

In May 1192, having taken ill, Mastropiero abdicated as doge and retired to the monastery of San Croce. He died there on 13 June 1192.

<doc id="379262" wikidata="Q1122595" url="?curid=379262" title="Field Museum of Natural History">
<text>The Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), also known as The Field Museum, is a natural history museum in Chicago, Illinois, and is one of the largest such museums in the world. The museum is popular for the size and quality of its educational and scientific programs, and its extensive scientific specimen and artifact collections. The permanent exhibitions, which attract up to 2 million visitors annually, include fossils, current cultures from around the world, and interactive programming demonstrating today&#x27;s urgent conservation needs. The museum is named in honor of its first major benefactor, Marshall Field, the department-store magnate. The museum and its collections originated from the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition and the artifacts displayed at the fair.

The museum maintains a temporary exhibition program of traveling shows as well as in-house produced topical exhibitions. The professional staff maintains collections of over 24 million specimens and objects that provide the basis for the museum&#x27;s scientific-research programs. These collections include the full range of existing biodiversity, gems, meteorites, fossils, and extensive anthropological collections and cultural artifacts from around the globe. The museum&#x27;s library, which contains over 275,000 books, journals, and photo archives focused on biological systematics, evolutionary biology, geology, archaeology, ethnology and material culture, supports the museum&#x27;s academic-research faculty and exhibit development. The academic faculty and scientific staff engage in field expeditions, in biodiversity and cultural research on every continent, in local and foreign student training, and in stewardship of the rich specimen and artifact collections. They work in close collaboration with public programming exhibitions and education initiatives.

==History==

In 1869, and before its formal establishment, the museum acquired the largest collection of birds and bird descriptions, from artist and ornithologist Daniel Giraud Elliot. In 1894, Elliot would become the curator of the Department of Zoology at the museum, where he worked until 1906.

To house the exhibits and collections assembled for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition for future generations, Edward Ayer convinced the merchant Marshall Field to fund the establishment of a museum. Originally titled the Columbian Museum of Chicago in honor of its origins, the Field Museum was incorporated by the State of Illinois on September 16, 1893, for the purpose of the &quot;accumulation and dissemination of knowledge, and the preservation and exhibition of artifacts illustrating art, archaeology, science and history&quot;. The Columbian Museum of Chicago occupied the only building remaining from the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Jackson Park, the Palace of Fine Arts. It is now home to the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry.

In 1905, the museum&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Field Museum of Natural History&quot; to honor its first major benefactor and to reflect its focus on the natural sciences. 

Stanley Field was the president in 1906.

During the period from 1943 to 1966, the museum was known as the Chicago Natural History Museum. In 1921, the Museum moved from its original location in Jackson Park to its present site on Chicago Park District property near downtown Chicago. By the late 1930s the Field Museum had emerged as one of the three premier museums in the United States, the other two being the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and the National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.

The museum has maintained its reputation through continuous growth, expanding the scope of collections and its scientific research output, in addition to its award-winning exhibitions, outreach publications, and programs. The Field Museum is part of Chicago&#x27;s lakefront Museum Campus that includes the John G. Shedd Aquarium and the Adler Planetarium.

In 2015, it was reported that an employee had defrauded the museum of $900,000 over a seven-year period to 2014.


==Attendance==
The Museum received 1,018,002 visitors in 2022, ranking it 21st in the List of most-visited museums in the United States.

==Permanent exhibitions==
=== Animal Halls ===
Animal exhibitions and dioramas such as Nature Walk, Mammals of Asia, and Mammals of Africa allow visitors an up-close look at the diverse habitats that animals inhabit. Most notably featured are the man-eating lions of Tsavo. The Mfuwe man eating lion is also on display.

=== Evolving Planet ===
Evolving Planet follows the evolution of life on Earth over 4 billion years. The exhibit showcases fossils of single-celled organisms, Permian synapsids, dinosaurs, extinct mammals, and early hominids. The Field Museum&#x27;s non-mammalian synapsid collection consists of over 1100 catalogued specimens, including 46 holotypes. The collection of basal synapsids includes 29 holotypes of caseid, ophiacodontid, edaphosaurid, varanopid, and sphenacodontid species – approximately 88% of catalogued specimens.
=== Inside Ancient Egypt ===
Inside Ancient Egypt offers a glimpse into what life was like for ancient Egyptians. Twenty-three human mummies are on display as well as many mummified animals. The exhibit features a three-story replica (featuring two authentic rooms with 5,000-year-old hieroglyphs) of the mastaba tomb of Unas-Ankh, the son of Unas (the last pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty). Also displayed are an ancient marketplace showing artifacts of everyday life, a shrine to the cat goddess Bastet, and dioramas showing the afterlife preparation process for the dead.

In 2024 the museum performed CT scans on 26 of their mummies.
=== The Ancient Americas ===
The Ancient Americas displays 13,000 years of human ingenuity and achievement in the Western Hemisphere, where hundreds of diverse societies thrived long before the arrival of Europeans. In this large permanent exhibition visitors can learn the epic story of the peopling of these continents, from the Arctic to the tip of South America. The exhibit consists of six displays: Ice Age Hunters, Innovative Hunters and Gatherers, Farming Villagers, Powerful Leaders, Rulers and Citizens, and Empire Builders. Visitors are encouraged to begin with Ice Age Hunters and conclude with Empire Builders. In this way, visitors can understand the cultural and economic progression of the Ancient Americas. Throughout the exhibit, collections are displayed in a way that emphasizes the cultural context of the artifacts.

The six displays draw from the Field Museum&#x27;s massive North America collection. Significant collections utilized by the exhibit include pre-Columbian artifacts gathered by Mayanists Edward H. Thompson and John E. S. Thompson. Additionally, former curator Paul Sidney Martin&#x27;s American Southwest collection makes up a significant portion of the &quot;Farming Villagers&quot; display. The Empire Builders display includes Aztec and Incan artifacts gathered in the 19th century.

The Ancient Americas exhibit transitions to the Alsdorf Hall of Northwest Coast and Arctic Peoples and eventually the Native Truths: Our Voices, Our Stories exhibit. This emphasizes the thematic unity of the Field Museum&#x27;s American collections.

=== Cultural Halls ===
Cultural exhibitions include sections on Tibet and China, where visitors can view traditional clothing. There is also an exhibit on life in Africa, where visitors can learn about the many different cultures on the continent, and an exhibit where visitors may &quot;visit&quot; several Pacific Islands. The museum houses an authentic 19th-century Māori Meeting House, Ruatepupuke II, from Tokomaru Bay, New Zealand. Additionally, the Field Museum&#x27;s Northwest Coast Collections showcase the early work of Franz Boas and Frederic Ward Putnam&#x27;s work with the Kwakwakaʼwakw (Kwakiutl) people in the Alsdorf Hall of Northwest Coast and Arctic Peoples. Finally, the &quot;Native Truths: Our Voices, Our Stories&quot; permanent exhibition displays the Field Museum&#x27;s current collaborative efforts with the indigenous people of North America.

==== Africa ====
The Africa cultural hall opened at the Field Museum in November 1993. It offers 14 different displays that are primarily ethnographic in nature. Several African countries are exhibited as well as a variety of geographical areas including the Sahara and East African rift valley. The final section is dedicated to the African diaspora with a particular focus on the impact of the slave trade on the continent. The Africa permanent exhibit owes most of its collection to the efforts of Wilfred D. Hambly.
==== Peoples of the Arctic and Pacific Northwest ====
This extensive permanent exhibition covers two culture areas that were vitally important to the early work of the Field Museum—the Arctic and Pacific Northwest. The Pacific Northwest collection is more extensive, but both collections are organized into four categories: subsistence, village and society, the spiritual world, and art. Major displays include a variety of dioramas and a large collection of totem poles. The current permanent exhibition has its origins in the &quot;Maritime Peoples&quot; hall created by the Field Museum&#x27;s curator of North American archaeology and ethnology James VanStone.

==== Cyrus Tang Hall of China ====

The Cyrus Tang Hall of China opened as a permanent exhibition in 2015. The hall consists of five sections: Diverse Landscapes, Ritual and Power, Shifting Power, Beliefs and Practices, and Crossing Boundaries. The first three sections are organized chronologically while the final two sections are organized by theme. Three hundred and fifty objects are displayed throughout the five galleries. These artifacts are a sample chosen from the Field Museum&#x27;s significant China collection. This collection was gathered by the sinologist Berthold Laufer.

==== Native Truths: Our Voices, Our Stories ====
&quot;Native Truths: Our Voices, Our Stories&quot; opened as a permanent exhibition in 2021. This exhibit is an extensive renovation of the former Native American Hall at the Field Museum. &quot;Native Truths&quot; utilizes about 400 artifacts to interpret Native American culture and history while also addressing modern-day challenges. The exhibition is a result of a changing attitude towards Native Americans that emphasized Native peoples instead of Native artifacts.
==== Regenstein Halls of the Pacific ====
This exhibit is dedicated to the natural and cultural history of the Pacific Islands and is organized into five different sections: the natural history of the islands, the cultural origins of Pacific Islanders, a canoe display, an ethnographic collection showcasing New Guinea&#x27;s Huon Gulf, and a modern Tahitian market. The final portion of the exhibit is dedicated to the ceremonial arts of the Pacific peoples. The majority of the collection was gathered by curator Albert Buell Lewis. Building upon Lewis&#x27; desire to portray cultures as living and participative, the exhibit was intentionally designed to demonstrate how the Pacific Islands interact with the contemporary world.

=== Geology Halls ===
The Grainger Hall of Gems consists of a large collection of diamonds and gems from around the world, and also includes a Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass window. The Hall of Jades focuses on Chinese jade artifacts spanning 8,000 years. The Robert A. Pritzker Center for Meteoritics and Polar Studies contains a large collection of fossil meteorites.

=== Underground Adventure ===
The Underground Adventure gives visitors a bug&#x27;s-eye look at the world beneath their feet. Visitors can see what insects and soil look like from that size, while learning about the biodiversity of soil and the importance of healthy soil.

===Working Laboratories===
* DNA Discovery Center – Visitors can watch real scientists extract DNA from a variety of organisms. Museum goers can also speak to a live scientist through the glass every day and ask them any questions about DNA.
* McDonald&#x27;s Fossil Prep Lab – The public can watch as paleontologists prepare real fossils for study.
* The Regenstein Pacific Conservation Laboratory – conservation and collections facility. Visitors can watch as conservators work to preserve and study anthropological specimens from all over the world.

=== Sue, the &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; ===

On May 17, 2000, the Field Museum unveiled &quot;Sue&quot;, the largest &quot;T. rex&quot; specimen discovered at the time. Sue has a length of , stands tall at the hips, and has been estimated at as of 2018. The specimen is estimated to be 67 million years old. The fossil was named after the person who discovered it, Sue Hendrickson, and is commonly referred to as female, although the dinosaur&#x27;s actual sex is unknown. The original skull is not mounted to the body due to the difficulties in examining the specimen 13 feet off the ground, and for nominal aesthetic reasons (the replica does not require a steel support under the mandible). An examination of the bones revealed that Sue died at age 28, a record for the fossilized remains of a &quot;T. rex&quot; until Trix was found in 2013. In December 2018 after revisions of the skeletal assembly were made to reflect new concepts of Sue&#x27;s structure, display of the skeleton was moved into a new suite in &quot;The Griffin Halls of Evolving Planet&quot;.

==Scientific collections==
Professionally managed and maintained specimen and artifact collections, such as those at the Field Museum of Natural History, are a major research resource for the national and international scientific community, supporting extensive research that tracks environmental changes, benefits homeland security, public health and safety, and serves taxonomy and systematics research. Many of Field Museum&#x27;s collections rank among the top ten collections in the world, e.g., the bird skin collection ranks fourth worldwide; the mollusk collection is among the five largest in North America; the fish collection is ranked among the largest in the world.
The scientific collections of the Field Museum originate from the specimens and artifacts assembled between 1891 and 1893 for the World Columbian Exposition. Already at its founding, the Field Museum had a large anthropological collection.

A large number of the early natural history specimens were purchased from Ward&#x27;s Natural History Establishment in Rochester, New York. An extensive acquisition program, including large expeditions conducted by the museum&#x27;s curatorial staff resulted in substantial collection growth. During the first 50 years of the museum&#x27;s existence, over 440 Field Museum expeditions acquired specimens from all parts of the world.

In addition, material was added through purchase, such as H. N. Patterson&#x27;s herbarium in 1900, and the Strecker butterfly collection in 1908.

Extensive specimen material and artifacts were given to the museum by collectors and donors, such as the Boone collection of over 3,500 East Asian artifacts, consisting of books, prints and various objects. In addition, &quot;orphaned collections&quot; were and are taken in from other institutions such as universities that change their academic programs away from collections-based research. For example, already beginning in 1907, Field Museum accepted substantial botanical specimen collections from universities such as University of Chicago, Northwestern University and University of Illinois at Chicago, into its herbarium. These specimens are maintained and continuously available for researchers worldwide. The &quot;Index Herbariorum&quot; code assigned to this botanic garden is F and it is used when citing housed specimens. Targeted collecting in the US and abroad for research programs of the curatorial and collection staff continuously add high quality specimen material and artifacts; e.g., Dr. Robert Inger&#x27;s collection of frogs from Borneo as part of his research into the ecology and biodiversity of the Indonesian fauna.

Collecting of specimens and acquisition of artifacts is nowadays subject to clearly spelled-out policies and standards, with the goal to acquire only materials and specimens for which the provenance can be established unambiguously. All collecting of biological specimens is subject to proper collecting and export permits; frequently, specimens are returned to their country of origin after study. Field Museum stands among the leading institutions developing such ethics standards and policies; Field Museum was an early adopter of voluntary repatriation practices of ethnological and archaeological artifacts.

===Collection care and management===
Field Museum collections are professionally managed by collection managers and conservators, who are skilled in preparation and preservation techniques. Numerous maintenance and collection management tools were and are being advanced at Field Museum. For example, Carl Akeley&#x27;s development of taxidermy excellence produced the first natural-looking mammal and bird specimens for exhibition as well as for study. Field Museum curators developed standards and best practices for the care of collections. Conservators at the Field Museum have made notable contributions to conservation science with methods of preservation of artifacts including the use of pheromone trapping for control of webbing clothes moths.

The Field Museum was an early adopter of positive-pressure based approaches to control of environment in display cases, using control modules for humidity control in several galleries where room-level humidification was not practical. The museum has also adopted a low-energy approach to maintain low humidity to prevent corrosion in archaeological metals using ultra-well-sealed barrier film micro-environments. Other notable contributions include methods for dyeing Japanese papers to color match restorations in organic substrates, the removal of display mounts from historic objects, testing of collections for residual heavy metal pesticides, presence of early plastics in collections, the effect of sulfurous products in display cases, and the use of light tubes in display cases.

Concordant with research developments, new collection types, such as frozen tissue collections, requiring new collecting and preservation techniques are added to the existing holdings.

Despite the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in 1990, the Field Museum is estimated to hold more than 1000 Native American remains that have not been repatriated.

===Collection records===

Collection management requires meticulous record keeping. Handwritten ledgers captured specimen and artifact data in the past. Field Museum was an early adopter of computerization of collection data beginning in the late 1970s. Field Museum contributes its digitized collection data to a variety of online groups and platforms, such as: HerpNet, VertNet and Antweb, Global Biodiversity Information Facility (also known as GBif), and others. All Field Museum collection databases are unified and currently maintained in KE EMu software system. The research value of digitized specimen data and georeferenced locality data is widely acknowledged, enabling analyses of distribution shifts due to climate changes, land use changes and others.

===Collection use===
During the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, all acquired specimens and objects were on display; the purpose of the World&#x27;s Fair was exhibition of these materials. For example, just after opening of the Columbian Museum of Chicago, the mollusk collection occupied one entire exhibit hall, displaying 3,000 species of mollusks on about . By 1910, 20,000 shell specimens were on display, with an additional 15,000 &quot;in storage&quot;.

Only a small fraction of the specimens and artifacts are publicly displayed. The vast majority of specimens and artifacts are used by a wide range of people in the museum and around the world. Field Museum curatorial faculty and their graduate students and postdoctoral trainees use the collections in their research and in training e.g., in formal high school and undergraduate training programs. Researchers from all over the world can search online for particular specimens and request to borrow them, which are shipped routinely under defined and published loan policies, to ensure that the specimens remain in good condition. For example, in 2012, Field Museum&#x27;s Zoology collection processed 419 specimen loans, shipping over 42,000 specimens to researchers, per its Annual Report.

The collection specimens are an important cornerstone of research infrastructure in that each specimen can be re-examined and with the advancement of analytic techniques, new data can be gleaned from specimens that may have been collected more than 150 years ago.

==Library==
The library at the Field Museum was organized in 1893 for the museum&#x27;s scientific staff, visiting researchers, students, and members of the general public as a resource for research, exhibition development and educational programs. The 275,000 volumes of the Main Research Collections concentrate on biological systematics, environmental and evolutionary biology, anthropology, botany, geology, archaeology, museology and related subjects. The Field Museum Library includes the following collections:

===Ayer collection===
This private collection of Edward E. Ayer, the first president of the museum, contains virtually all the important works in the history of ornithology and is especially rich in color-illustrated works.

===Laufer Collection===

The working collection of Dr. Berthold Laufer, America&#x27;s first sinologist and Curator of Anthropology until his death in 1934, consists of about 7,000 volumes in Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, and numerous Western languages on anthropology, archaeology, religion, science, and travel.

===Photo archives===
The photo archives contain over 250,000 images in the areas of anthropology, botany, geology and zoology and documents the history and architecture of the museum, its exhibitions, staff and scientific expeditions. In 2008 two collections from the Photo Archives became available via the &quot;Illinois Digital Archives&quot; (IDA): The World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893 and Urban Landscapes of Illinois. In April 2009, the Photo Archives became part of Flickr Commons.

===Karl P. Schmidt Memorial Herpetological Library===

The Karl P. Schmidt Memorial Herpetological Library, named for Karl Patterson Schmidt is a research library containing over 2,000 herpetological books and an extensive reprint collection.

===John James Audubon&#x27;s Birds of North America===
The Field Museum&#x27;s Double Elephant folio of Audubon&#x27;s &quot;The Birds of America&quot; is one of only two known copies that were arranged in taxonomic order. Additionally, it contains all 13 composite plates. The Field&#x27;s copy belonged to Audubon&#x27;s family physician Dr. Benjamin Phillips.

==Education and research==

The Field Museum offers opportunities for informal and more structured public learning. Exhibitions remain the primary means of informal education, but throughout its history the Museum has supplemented this approach with innovative educational programs. The Harris Loan Program, for example, begun in 1912, reaches out to children in Chicago area schools, offering artifacts, specimens, audiovisual materials, and activity kits. The Department of Education, begun in 1922, offers classes, lectures, field trips, museum overnights and special events for families, adults and children. The Field has adopted production of the YouTube channel &quot;The Brain Scoop&quot;, hiring its host Emily Graslie full-time as &#x27;Chief Curiosity Correspondent&#x27;.

The Museum&#x27;s curatorial and scientific staff in the departments of Anthropology, Botany, Geology, and Zoology conducts basic research in systematic biology and anthropology, besides its responsibility for collections management, and educational programs. It has long maintained close links, including joint teaching, students, seminars, with the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois at Chicago. Professional symposia and lectures, like the annual A. Watson Armour III Spring Symposium, present scientific results to the international scientific community and the public at large.

==Academic publication==
The museum used to publish four peer-reviewed monograph series issued under the collective title &quot;Fieldiana&quot;, devoted to anthropology, botany, geology and zoology.

<doc id="379264" wikidata="Q305567" url="?curid=379264" title="Abaris the Hyperborean">
<text>In Greek mythology, Abaris the Hyperborean (, Ábaris Hyperbóreios), son of Seuthes (Σεύθης), was a legendary sage, healer, and priest of Apollo known to the Ancient Greeks. He was supposed to have learned his skills in his homeland of Hyperborea, which he fled during a plague. He was said to be endowed with the gift of prophecy, and along with his Scythian dress, simplicity, and honesty, he created great sensation in Greece, and was held in high esteem.

==Legend==
According to Herodotus, he was said to have traveled around the world with an arrow symbolizing Apollo, eating no food. Heraclides Ponticus (c. 390 BC–c. 310 BC) wrote that Abaris flew on it. Plato (&quot;Charmides&quot; 158C) classes him amongst the &quot;Thracian physicians&quot; who practice medicine upon the soul as well as the body by means of &quot;incantations&quot; (, epodaí). A temple to Persephone at Sparta was attributed to Abaris by Pausanias (9.10). Alan H. Griffiths compares Abaris to Aristeas in terms of being a &quot;shamanistic missionary and savior-figure&quot; and notes Pindar places Abaris during the time of Croesus.

===Phalaris===
A particularly rich trove of anecdotes is found in Iamblichus&#x27;s &quot;Vita Pythagorica&quot;. Here, Abaris is said to have purified Sparta and Knossos, among other cities, from plagues (&quot;VP&quot; 92–93). Abaris also appears in a climactic scene alongside Pythagoras at the court of the Sicilian tyrant Phalaris. The two sages discuss divine matters, and urge the obstinate tyrant towards virtue (ibid. 215–221). Iamblichus also attributes a special expertise at extispicy to Abaris, the art of divination through the examination of anomalies in the entrails of animals. The &quot;Suda&quot; attributes a number of books to Abaris, including a volume of &quot;Scythian Oracles&quot; in dactylic hexameter, a prose theogony, a poem on the marriage of the river Hebrus, a work on purifications, and an account of Apollo&#x27;s visit to the Hyperboreans. Such works, however, if they were really current in ancient times, were no more genuine than his reputed correspondence with Phalaris the tyrant. He is among the authors (= &quot;FGrHist&quot; 34) whose fragments were collected in Felix Jacoby&#x27;s &quot;Fragmente der griechischen Historiker&quot;.

A more securely historical Greco-Scythian philosopher, who travelled among the Hellenes in the early sixth century, was Anacharsis.

Eighteenth century Bath architect John Wood, the Elder wrote about Abaris, and put forth the fanciful suggestion that he should be identified with King Bladud.

==Modern impact==
* A Senior Society at Dartmouth College is named Abaris after this figure; it is one of eight Senior Societies among Dartmouth College student groups.
* Abaris is featured in songs by the band Therion; &quot;An Arrow From The Sun&quot; (&quot;Lemuria&quot;), &quot;The Wand of Abaris&quot; and &quot;The Falling Stone&quot; (both from &quot;Gothic Kabbalah&quot;).
* Peter Kingsley makes Abaris a key figure in his 2010 book &quot;A Story Waiting to Pierce You: Mongolia, Tibet and the Destiny of the Western World&quot;.

<text>FUDOSI or FUDOESI (French: &quot;Fédération Universelle des Ordres et Sociétés Initiatiques&quot;, Latin: &quot;Federatio Universalis Dirigens Ordines Societatesque Initiationis&quot;) was a federation of autonomous esoteric or mystical orders and societies, founded on August 14, 1934, in Brussels, Belgium, and disbanded in 1951. It was opposed by the similarly named &quot;Fédération Universelle des Ordres, Fraternités et Sociétés Initiatiques&quot; (FUDOFSI).

==Background==
FUDOSI was an attempt to create a federation of mystical orders with the mission &quot;to protect the sacred liturgies, rites and doctrines of the traditional initiatory Orders from being appropriated and profaned by clandestine organizations.&quot; One of its leading founders was AMORC (Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis). An AMORC document describes the nature of FUDOSI as follows:

==Leadership and organisation==
SAR, a title which means &quot;Son of Ra&quot; or &quot;Son Altesse Royale&quot; (His Royal Highness), was attached to all dignitaries of FUDOSI. After the first organised convention in 1934, 12 members were chosen to form the Supreme Council, led by 3 imperators:

* Sar Hieronymus (Emile Dantinne) Imperator of Europe
* Sar Alden (Harvey Spencer Lewis) Imperator of the American continent
* Sar Yesir (Victor Blanchard) Imperator of &quot;The Orient&quot;.

H. S. Lewis (Sar Alden) created the symbol of FUDOSI. After Lewis&#x27; death in 1939, his son Ralph Maxwell Lewis became one of the three imperators of FUDOSI, under the name Sar Validivar. In 1946 Andre Cordonnier became one of its imperators.

==Associated organisations==
Here is a list of the orders and societies represented on the first FUDOSI convention of 1934:

* &quot;Ordre de la Rose+Croix universelle&quot; (Sar Hieronymus) 
* &quot;Ordre de la Rose+Croix universitaire&quot; (Sar Hieronymus, Sar Elgrim)
* &quot;Ordre kabbalistique de la Rose+Croix&quot; (Sar Yesir representing Lucien Mauchel)
* &quot;Confrerie des Freres illumines de la Rose+Croix&quot; (Sar Amertis)
* &quot;A.M.O.R.C. U.S.A.&quot; (Sar Alden, Sar Emmanuel, Sar Iohannes)
* &quot;Militia crucifera evangelica&quot; (Sar Alden) 
* &quot;Ordre ancien et mystique de la Rose+Croix AMORC-Switzerland&quot; (Sar Amertis representing Sar Alkmaion) 
* &quot;Societe alchimique de France&quot; (Sar Amertis) 
* &quot;Ordre des Samaritains inconnus&quot; (Sar Amertis) 
* &quot;Ordre hermetiste tetramegiste et mystique&quot; or &quot;Ordre Pythagoricien&quot; (Sar Succus, Sar Helios)
* &quot;Ordre martiniste et synarchique&quot; (Sar Yesir) 
* &quot;Fraternite des Polaires&quot; (Sar Yesir) 
* &quot;Ordre maçonnique oriental de Memphis-Mizraim stricte observance&quot; (Sar Iohannes, Sar Ludovicus)
* Co-masonic Order of Memphis-Mizraim (Sar Laya, Sar Fulgur) 
* &quot;L&#x27;Eglise gnostique universelle&quot; (Tau Targelius = Victor Blanchard)
&quot;Ordre maçonnique oriental de Memphis-Misraim (stricte observance)&quot; and the Mixed Order of Memphis-Mizraim, the only Masonic organizations associated with FUDOSI, were expelled according to a decision taken by the three Imperators (Lewis, Dantinne, Blanchard) on August 1, 1935.

==Position with respect to Masonry==
A document by FUDOSI titled &quot;Rapport sur les ordres et sociétés initiatiques. 12/10/1941&quot;, written by FUDOSI Imperator Emille Dantinne, states with regard to Freemasonry:

But the admission turned out to be an error. Later in the document we read:

These declarations may be considered inconsistent with the fact that Freemasonry requires its members to believe in a Supreme Being. It is unknown whether these views were exclusive to Emille Dantinne or held by more FUDOSI members, however Sar Alden was a member of the Antient Rite of Memphis-Misraim.

==Dissolution==
After the end of the 8th convention (August 14, 1951) FUDOSI dissolved after strong disagreements between Emile Dantinne and Ralph M. Lewis. The 8th convention ended after Ralph M. Lewis criticized Jean Mallinger (Sar Elgrim), a FUDOSI dignitary, for having a &quot;problem&quot; with AMORC for its admission of Afro-American members. The three Imperators signed an official document that marked the end of FUDOSI.

<doc id="379269" wikidata="Q1140909" url="?curid=379269" title="Cronbach's alpha">
<text>Cronbach&#x27;s alpha (Cronbach&#x27;s formula_1), also known as tau-equivalent reliability (formula_2) or coefficient alpha (coefficient formula_1), is a reliability coefficient and a measure of the internal consistency of tests and measures. It was named after the American psychologist Lee Cronbach. 

Numerous studies warn against using Cronbach&#x27;s alpha unconditionally. Statisticians regard reliability coefficients based on structural equation modeling (SEM) or generalizability theory as superior alternatives in many situations.

==History==
In his initial 1951 publication, Lee Cronbach described the coefficient as &quot;Coefficient&quot; &quot;alpha&quot; and included an additional derivation. &quot;Coefficient alpha&quot; had been used implicitly in previous studies, but his interpretation was thought to be more intuitively attractive relative to previous studies and it became quite popular. 

* In 1967, Melvin Novick and Charles Lewis proved that it was equal to reliability if the true scores of the compared tests or measures vary by a constant, which is independent of the people measured. In this case, the tests or measurements were said to be &quot;essentially tau-equivalent.&quot;
* In 1978, Cronbach asserted that the reason the initial 1951 publication was widely cited was &quot;mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient.&quot; He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients, such as those used in inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability, after consecutive Greek letters (i.e., formula_4, formula_5, etc.), but later changed his mind.
* Later, in 2004, Cronbach and Richard Shavelson encouraged readers to use generalizability theory rather than formula_6. Cronbach opposed the use of the name &quot;Cronbach&#x27;s alpha&quot; and explicitly denied the existence of studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 before Cronbach&#x27;s 1951 publication of the same name.

==Prerequisites for using Cronbach&#x27;s alpha==
To use Cronbach&#x27;s alpha as a reliability coefficient, the following conditions must be met:
# The data is normally distributed and linear;
# The compared tests or measures are essentially tau-equivalent;
# Errors in the measurements are independent.

==Formula and calculation==
Cronbach&#x27;s alpha is calculated by taking a score from each scale item and correlating it with the total score for each observation. The resulting correlations are then compared with the variance for all individual item scores. Cronbach&#x27;s alpha is best understood as a function of the number of questions or items in a measure, the average covariance between pairs of items, and the overall variance of the total measured score.

formula_7

where:

* formula_8 represents the number of items in the measure
* formula_9 the variance associated with each item &quot;i&quot;
* formula_10 the variance associated with the total scores, formula_11

Alternatively, it can be calculated through the following formula:
:formula_12

where:

* formula_13 represents the average variance
* formula_14 represents the average inter-item covariance.

==Common misconceptions==

Application of Cronbach&#x27;s alpha is not always straightforward and can give rise to common misconceptions, some of which are detailed here.
===The value of Cronbach&#x27;s alpha ranges between zero and one===
By definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate formula_6 with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. formula_6 can be less than reliability when applied to data that are not essentially tau-equivalent. Suppose that formula_17 copied the value of formula_18 as it is, and formula_19 copied by multiplying the value of formula_18 by -1.

The covariance matrix between items is as follows, formula_21.

Negative formula_6 can occur for reasons such as negative discrimination or mistakes in processing reversely scored items.

Unlike formula_6, SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., formula_24) are always greater than or equal to zero.

This anomaly was first pointed out by Cronbach (1943) to criticize formula_6, but Cronbach (1951) did not comment on this problem in his article that otherwise discussed potentially problematic issues related formula_6.

===If there is no measurement error, the value of Cronbach&#x27;s alpha is one.===
This anomaly also originates from the fact that formula_6 underestimates reliability. 

Suppose that formula_17 copied the value of formula_18 as it is, and formula_19 copied by multiplying the value of formula_18 by two. 

The covariance matrix between items is as follows, formula_32.

For the above data, both formula_33 and formula_24 have a value of one.

The above example is presented by Cho and Kim (2015).

===A high value of Cronbach&#x27;s alpha indicates homogeneity between the items===
Many textbooks refer to formula_6 as an indicator of homogeneity between items. This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951) that high formula_6 values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to uni-dimensionality. Several studies have provided proofs or counterexamples that high formula_6 values do not indicate uni-dimensionality. See counterexamples below.

formula_38 in the uni-dimensional data above.

formula_38 in the multidimensional data above.
The above data have formula_40, but are multidimensional.

The above data have formula_41, but are uni-dimensional.

Uni-dimensionality is a prerequisite for formula_6. One should check uni-dimensionality before calculating formula_6 rather than calculating formula_6 to check uni-dimensionality.

===A high value of Cronbach&#x27;s alpha indicates internal consistency===
The term &quot;internal consistency&quot; is commonly used in the reliability literature, but its meaning is not clearly defined. The term is sometimes used to refer to a certain kind of reliability (e.g., internal consistency reliability), but it is unclear exactly which reliability coefficients are included here, in addition to formula_6. Cronbach (1951) used the term in several senses without an explicit definition. Cho and Kim (2015) showed that formula_6 is not an indicator of any of these.

===Removing items using &quot;alpha if item deleted&quot; always increases reliability===
Removing an item using &quot;alpha if item deleted&quot; may result in &#x27;alpha inflation,&#x27; where sample-level reliability is reported to be higher than population-level reliability. It may also reduce population-level reliability. The elimination of less-reliable items should be based not only on a statistical basis but also on a theoretical and logical basis. It is also recommended that the whole sample be divided into two and cross-validated.

==Ideal reliability level and how to increase reliability==
===Nunnally&#x27;s recommendations for the level of reliability===
Nunnally&#x27;s book is often mentioned as the primary source for determining the appropriate level of dependability coefficients. However, his proposals contradict his aims as he suggests that different criteria should be used depending on the goal or stage of the investigation. Regardless of the type of study, whether it is exploratory research, applied research, or scale development research, a criterion of 0.7 is universally employed. He advocated 0.7 as a criterion for the early stages of a study, most studies published in the journal do not fall under that category. Rather than 0.7, Nunnally&#x27;s applied research criterion of 0.8 is more suited for most empirical studies.
His recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly 0.8 when referring to the criteria of 0.8. If the reliability has a value near 0.8 (e.g., 0.78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.

===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===
Nunnally&#x27;s idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.

====Trade-off with validity====
Measurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who takes the test with a reliability of one will either receive a perfect score or a zero score, because if they answer one item correctly or incorrectly, they will answer all other items in the same manner. The phenomenon where validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is known as the attenuation paradox.

A high value of reliability can conflict with content validity. To achieve high content validity, each item should comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used solely to increase reliability.

====Trade-off with efficiency====
When the other conditions are equal, reliability increases as the number of items increases. However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.

===Methods to increase reliability===
Despite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.

Before data collection:
* Eliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.
* Do not measure what the respondents do not know.
* Increase the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.
* Use a scale that is known to be highly reliable.
* Conduct a pretest - discover in advance the problem of reliability.
* Exclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reverse-scored items).

After data collection:
* Remove the problematic items using &quot;alpha if item deleted&quot;. However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.
* Use a more accurate reliability coefficient than formula_6. For example, formula_24 is 0.02 larger than formula_6 on average.

==Which reliability coefficient to use==
formula_2 is used in an overwhelming proportion. A study estimates that approximately 97% of studies use formula_2 as a reliability coefficient.

However, simulation studies comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients have led to the common result that formula_2 is an inaccurate reliability coefficient.

Methodological studies are critical of the use of formula_2. Simplifying and classifying the conclusions of existing studies are as follows.
# Conditional use: Use formula_2 only when certain conditions are met.
# Opposition to use: formula_2 is inferior and should not be used.

===Alternatives to Cronbach&#x27;s alpha===
Existing studies are practically unanimous in that they oppose the widespread practice of using formula_2 unconditionally for all data. However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of formula_2.

Different reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.

The majority opinion is to use structural equation modeling or SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to formula_2.

However, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., uni-dimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.

Some people suggest formula_59 as an alternative, but formula_59 shows information that is completely different from reliability. formula_59 is a type of coefficient comparable to Reveille&#x27;s formula_4. They do not substitute, but complement reliability.

Among SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is formula_63, also known as composite or congeneric reliability.

====Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients====
General-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate formula_2. Users who don&#x27;t know the formula formula_2 have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks.

SEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on formula_2 instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients. There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.

# R (free): The psych package calculates various reliability coefficients.
# EQS (paid): This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.
# RelCalc (free): Available with Microsoft Excel. formula_63 can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of formula_59 can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.

<text>Rescue On Fractalus! is a space combat simulator video game created by Lucasfilm Games. It was originally released in 1985 for the Atari 8-bit computers and Atari 5200 console, then ported to the Apple II, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Tandy Color Computer 3, and Commodore 64. The player flies a space fighter near the surface of a planet, with the goal of rescuing downed pilots. The terrain is generated via fractals, from which the eponymous planet and game title are taken.

The game was one of the first two products from the fledgling Lucasfilm Computer Division Games Group led by Peter Langston. David Fox was the project leader and designer. Music was mainly composed by Charlie Kellner.

==Gameplay==
===Flying===
The game uses fractal technology to create the craggy mountains of an alien planet, where the visilibility was drastically reduced by the dense atmosphere. The player controls a fictional &quot;Valkyrie&quot; space fighter (converted for search and rescue duty) from a first-person view, attempting to land and pick up downed Ethercorps pilots. Some of these mountains hold anti-aircraft guns, which have to be avoided or destroyed. Due to the varied terrain, the direction finder has to be used to locate the pilots, whose visual beacons are often masked by mountain ridges.

At higher levels, the enemy Jaggis begin flying &quot;kamikaze&quot; saucers. The mission area also moves into day/night boundaries. Night missions are particularly difficult, requiring diligent use of the altimeter to avoid crashing.

Flying consumes fuel. The way to replenish this supply is to rescue downed pilots who bring their remaining fuel supplies on board.

The thick atmosphere is sufficiently acidic that downed pilots&#x27; craft are being slowly disintegrated. An exposed pilot&#x27;s survival time outside his craft is less than a minute, due to his flight suit and helmet literally dissolving. This makes it imperative that the player rescue pilots as quickly and efficiently as possible.

===Rescue===
After landing within sufficient &quot;walking&quot; proximity to the pilot, the player shuts down the engine, also turning off the ship&#x27;s shields. Turning on the engines prematurely would incinerate the exposed pilot and the shields would prevent him from entering the ship, however is required if the player wishes to defend themselves from attacking enemies while landed. The downed pilot then disembarks his crashed ship, runs down to the Valkyrie&#x27;s cockpit, and knocks on the crew entry door; the player can then open up and let the pilot in to complete the rescue. Failing to open the door kills the pilot; his knocking on the hatch becomes at first frantic, then slower and more feeble as he perishes in the corrosive environment. Sometimes the pilot found is an Ace Pilot, indicated visually by their purple helmet. These are worth ten times the score awarded for a normal pilot to the player.
As a twist on this relatively straightforward premise, added at the suggestion of George Lucas, some of the &quot;pilots in distress&quot; are actually hostile aliens in disguise; this twist was kept out of the game&#x27;s manual and marketing. After landing near a downed pilot, the player watches him run off-screen, and then has to wait for several tense seconds—if it were human, the familiar, frantic &quot;tap-tap&quot; noise would be heard from the ship&#x27;s hatch; otherwise, the alien Jaggi would suddenly jump back into view, sans helmet, roaring and trying to smash into the cockpit. Unless the player restores the ship&#x27;s shields, the windscreen cracks open and the pilot is killed. Likewise, inadvertently letting a Jaggi pilot into the player&#x27;s ship has disastrous results — it begins to dismantle the ship. In early levels, the Jaggi can be distinguished by their green heads versus the white human helmets, but in later levels the aliens evidently learn to don the human helmet and become identical in appearance. This, along with an unpredictable pause between the human/alien approach and the tap-tap/alien jump makes for a tense experience. According to head developer David Fox, this shock moment made &quot;Rescue on Fractalus!&quot; &quot;the first computer game to really scare people&quot;.

==Development==
&quot;Rescue on Fractalus!&quot;, together with &quot;Ballblazer&quot;, were the first two games developed by the fledgling Lucasfilm Computer Division Games Group. The Games Group had been established in 1982 on a $1 million funding from Atari, Inc. in exchange for the &quot;right of first refusal&quot; for Atari as publisher. Both games were developed with the Atari 8-bit computers and Atari 5200 console in mind.

During development, &quot;Rescue on Fractalus!&quot; was named &quot;Behind Jaggi Lines!&quot;. This name refers both to the Jaggis, the fictional race of hostile aliens in the game, as well as the lack of spatial anti-aliasing in the game&#x27;s graphics, resulting in jagged diagonal (or curved) lines, colloquially known as &quot;jaggies&quot;. The squiggles visible on the Jaggi&#x27;s suit when it attacks are actually the initials of the development team rotated by 90 degrees; Atari at the time famously barred developers from having their name displayed in games.

The developers of &quot;Rescue on Fractalus&quot; wanted the game to be set in &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe but were not allowed to do so by George Lucas.

The games were ready by March 1984 and were first publicly revealed on a Lucasfilm press conference on May 8. Cartridge versions for the Atari computers and the 5200 were planned to be the released first in the third quarter of 1984, with disk versions for the Commodore 64, IBM PC and Apple IIc and IIe coming under the Atarisoft label in the fourth quarter of that year. &quot;Rescue on Fractalus!&quot; and &quot;Ballblazer&quot; were also scheduled to be released for the then-upcoming Atari 7800 console.

On July 3, Warner Communications sold all assets of the Consumer Division of Atari, Inc. to Jack Tramiel, and the agreement with Lucasfilm fell through. On the Winter Consumer Electronics Show on January 5–8, 1985, with both &quot;Rescue on Fractalus!&quot; and &quot;Ballblazer&quot; not yet being released on any platform, Epyx became a distributor for both games, which would be released in disk format for the Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64 computers. The Atari 5200 versions were not part of the distribution deal. Epyx finally published the Atari 8-bit versions of both games by May 1985, and the Commodore 64 version of &quot;Rescue&quot; by August of that year.

Besides the Atari 8-bit and Commodore 64 computers, &quot;Rescue on Fractalus&quot; was ported to the Apple II and TRS-80 Color Computer; and to Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum computers by Activision, who published the game in Europe. While the IBM PC port announced in 1984 never materialized, Tramiel&#x27;s Atari Corporation eventually released the Atari 5200 cartridge version in limited quantities in late 1986, manufactured from the stock inherited from the July 1984 buyout of Atari, Inc.; and the cartridge version for the Atari 8-bit computers in December 1987, packaged for their new XE Game System.

The Atari 7800 version was cancelled before the game was completed. In 2004, an unfinished prototype was found in the possession of its original programmers, with a significant amount of gameplay elements not implemented.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that &quot;Fractalus&quot; and &quot;Ballblazer&quot; &quot;are slightly weak in the finer points of game design, but ... set a new standard for arcade-style games that will set out future expectations&quot;. In 1996, the magazine named &quot;Rescue on Fractalus!&quot; the 82nd best game ever, with the editors remarking that &quot;many keep old computers around just to play it&quot;. &quot;Commodore User&quot; thought the game was &quot;nothing special&quot; and said it &quot;provides reasonable, if unchanging, gameplay with a good flight simulator, but it lacks something, probably a proper identity&quot;. &quot;Zzap!64&quot; were impressed by the game, awarding it a score of 91%. They said that it was an excellent shoot-em-up. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; praised the graphics and advised fans to also play &quot;Koronis Rift&quot;.

==Legacy==
LucasArts and Factor 5 began work on a sequel titled &quot;Return to Fractalus&quot; for the Amiga in the late 1980s, but it was decided that the hardware couldn&#x27;t handle the concept being worked on. An Amiga port of &quot;Rescue On Fractalus&quot; to be published by Rainbow Arts was announced in a February 1991 issue of &quot;The One&quot;, but was never released. By 1994, Factor 5 believed that the current generation of 3D consoles had the technology the &quot;Fractalus&quot; sequel required and again began work on the game. Eventually, the work on game was converted to &quot;Star Wars: Rogue Squadron&quot; for the Nintendo 64 instead.

<doc id="379287" wikidata="Q735523" url="?curid=379287" title="Master–slave (technology)">
<text>In engineering, master–slave is a relationship between two systems in which one controls the other. In some cases one master controls just one slave system, but in others there are multiple slave systems controlled by the same master. Sometimes the master is a different kind of system than the slave, but sometimes there are multiple similar systems and one of them is designated the master in order to centralize external (i.e. user) control of the collection.

Due to its connection to slavery, the terminology is a subject of controversy and has been replaced with alternative terms in some cases.

== Examples ==

In photography, secondary, or slave, flash units are connected to a master unit to provide synchronized lighting.

Parallel audio duplication often entails multiple recording devices (i.e. for cassette tape or compact disc) linked together so that operating the controls of a master device triggers the same commands on slave devices.

Railway locomotives operating in the same train (for example, to pull a load too heavy for a single locomotive) may be configured for master–slave operation with all but one of the locomotives controlled from the first. See Multiple-unit train control.

In a hydraulic system, a master cylinder is a control device that converts force into hydraulic pressure that drives movement in a slave cylinder at the other end of the hydraulic line. A common application is a vehicle brake system.

A master clock provides time signals used to synchronize one or more slave clocks as part of a clock network; a slave clock receives and displays the time from a master; though it may be able to keep time itself if the master is not working.

=== Computing ===
Computer bus protocols often use a master-slave relationship. For instance, a USB host manages access to the USB bus shared by any number of USB devices. A serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus typically has a single master controlling multiple slaves. I2C and I3C may even have multiple masters on a bus. Modbus also uses a master device to initiate connection requests to slave devices.

An edge-triggered flip-flop can be created by arranging two gated latches in a master–slave configuration. It is so named because the master latch controls the slave latch&#x27;s value and forces the slave latch to hold its value, as the slave latch always copies its new value from the master latch.

In database replication, the master database is the authoritative source. The slave or replica database is controlled by the master database which repeats its update commands (for example by way of event log) to the slave. The slave therefore retains an exact copy of transaction processed by the source database (up to the most recently transmitted log) This scheme is not as strict as electronic devices sharing a clock, however the slave database only does what the master tells it, unless the slave is promoted due to failure of the master. Some databases implement so called &quot;multi-master replication&quot;, where a mix of writeable master nodes and readable nodes are used. These databases are used in scenarios where performance is an acceptable tradeoff for ACID properties, for example non mission critical data, like suggesting similar purchases.

== Non-examples ==

The term &quot;master&quot; is used in some technology contexts that do not refer to a relationship of control. &quot;Master&quot; may be used to mean a copy that has more significance than other copies in which case the term is an absolute concept; not a relationship. Sometimes the term &quot;master-slave&quot; is used in contexts that do not imply a controlling relationship.

In source code management master may refer to the trunk branch.
In disk imaging the gold master is the version which will be released to manufacturing for duplication.

A Parallel ATA (aka IDE) hard drive interface supports two hard drives on a cable, which are designated &quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot;. The distinction is required by the interface even though neither drive has control or priority over the other.

== History ==

The &quot;master–slave&quot; terminology was first used in 1904. 

The terminology was used in 1988 for RFC 1059 and in 1997 for RFC 2136, related to the domain name system. In 2020, Paul Vixie commented on his choice of words:

I introduced the master/slave terminology in RFC 2136, because I needed names for the roles in an AXFR/IXFR transaction, and the zone transfer hierarchy could be more than one layer deep, such that a server might initiate some AXFR/IXFR&#x27;s to the &quot;primary master&quot; but then respond to AXFR/IXFR&#x27;s from other servers. In retrospect I should have chosen the terms, &quot;transfer initiator&quot; and &quot;transfer responder&quot;. However, the hydraulic brake and clutch systems in my car had &quot;master cylinders&quot; and &quot;slave cylinders&quot;, and so I did not think I was either inventing a new use for the words &quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot;, or that my use of them for this purpose would be controversial.

Said hydraulic brakes for the automotive industry were patented in 1917 by Malcolm Loughead. The term &quot;slave cylinder&quot; was used in other patent applications, including one by Robert Esnault-Pelterie, published in 1919.

== Controversy ==
Media analytics company Global Language Monitor placed &quot;master/slave&quot; first in their annual list of politically charged language for 2004. The Black Lives Matter movement in the United States sparked renewed discussion, and terminology changes occurred in 2020. Some argued, however, that terminology changes were superficial performative activism. None-the-less, various alternate and generally context sensitive terms have been proposed including:

* primary-secondary
* main-replica or subordinate
* initiator-target
* requester-responder
* controller-target or device
* host-worker or proxy
* leader-follower
* director-performer
* boss-worker
* primary-replica
* principal-agent
* controller-worker
* primary-subordinate

===Notable events===

In 2003, after receiving a discrimination complaint from a county employee, the County of Los Angeles in California asked that manufacturers, suppliers and contractors stop using &quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot; terminology on products. Following complaints, the County of Los Angeles issued a statement saying that the decision was &quot;nothing more than a request&quot;. 

In 2018, after a heated debate, developers of Python replaced the term. Python switched to &quot;main&quot;, &quot;parent&quot;, and &quot;server&quot;; and &quot;worker&quot;, &quot;child&quot;, and &quot;helper&quot;, depending on context. The Linux kernel adopted a similar policy to use more specific terms in new code and documentation.

In July 2018, Google&#x27;s developer style guide was updated to include avoiding the term &quot;master&quot; in software documentation, especially in combination with &quot;slave.&quot; Instead, the guide recommends terms --when in combination -- such as &quot;primary/secondary&quot; and &quot;original/replica&quot;; Many individual variants of master and slave are given. 

In 2020, GitHub renamed the default &quot;master&quot; git branch to &quot;main&quot;.

<doc id="379290" wikidata="Q5339731" url="?curid=379290" title="Edmund Peck">
<text>Edmund James Peck (April 15, 1850 – September 10, 1924), known in Inuktitut as &quot;Uqammaq&quot; (one who talks well), was an Anglican missionary in the Canadian North on the Quebec coast of Hudson Bay and on Baffin Island. He founded the first permanent mission on Baffin Island, Nunavut. He developed Inuktitut syllabics, derived from the Cree syllabary and the first substantial English-Inuktitut dictionary.

His diaries provide an account of the daily life and work of the early missionaries in Baffin Island. Peck conducted extensive research on Inuit oral traditions and presents several detailed verbatim accounts of shamanic traditions and practices. His work contributes to the understanding of Inuit culture and history. His ethnographic data was collected at the request of famed anthropologist Franz Boas in 1897.

==Early life (1850–1876)==

Edmund James Peck was born April 15, 1850, in Rusholme, England. His mother and father died before his teen years. At fifteen, he joined the Royal Navy. By the age of 25 he had served on the Ajax, Impregnable, Caledonia, Excellent and the Hector. On the Hector, he organized prayer groups for the crew.

In 1875, he studied Greek and theology at the Reading Institute of the Church Missionary Society in Islington, England. In the Spring of the next year, John Horden, the Bishop of Moose Factory, recruited him for mission work in Hudson Bay.

==Little Whale River (1876–1886)==
Edmund Peck left England for Canada in June 1876. During the three-month trip he studied the Inuit language of Inuktitut. He used a Moravian Inuktitut New Testament and compared it to the English Bible. In this way he learned the meaning of Inuktitut words. He arrived at Moose Factory, James Bay, September 1, 1876. From there he traveled to the Hudson Bay Company post at the mouth of the Little Whale River in what is now Northern Quebec. He arrived there on October 24, 1876.

===Syllabics===

In the 1840s, Methodist missionary James Evans, located at Norway House, Manitoba, created a syllabic writing system for the Ojibwe and Cree. A few years later, in the 1850s, Anglican Bishop John Horden and Missionary E.A. Watkins, adapted Evans&#x27; Cree syllabic orthography to Inuktitut. Watkins&#x27; introduced the syllabic writing system to Inuit at Fort George and Little Whale River in 1855, and that same year Horden printed a small book of scripture verses in syllables on his press at Moose Factory. In 1865, Harden and Watkins met in conference in England and modified the syllabic system to allow a more precise rendering of both Inuktitut and Moose Cree.

Edmund Peck devoted his attention to the translation of scripture into Inuktitut using Horden and Watkins&#x27; orthography. He transcribed extracts of New Testament and published them in 1878. In 1897, he published the four gospels. This was almost identical to an 1878 Labrador translation, the main difference being in the orthography. Peck translated the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; in 1881. The New Testament was published in 1912 by the British and Foreign Bible Society. Psalms was published in 1917.

Peck&#x27;s system was simple and easy for Inuit to learn. By the 1920s, it had spread widely among them. Mothers taught it to their children. The children, in turn, would teach each other. Most of the population could read and write it. They often wrote letters to each other and consequently pencil and pocket-books were in great demand.

The orthography of Horden, Watkins and Peck remained the Inuktitut standard for close to 100 years. In the 1970s, the Inuit Cultural Institute led in a major revision of the system.

==Blacklead Island Mission (1894–1905)==

In 1894 the whaling station on Blacklead Island, in Cumberland Sound, was purchased by Mr. C. Noble and offered to Peck as an Anglican mission. His only communication with the outside world was a ship which, specially chartered, visited him once a year, brought him letters and supplies. With his colleague, Mr. Bilby, he built his own house and cooked his own meals. The settlement consisted of a church, a hospital and two dwelling-houses. The earliest church was made of seal-skin; it had to be replaced by a wooden structure, as it was devoured by the dogs.

===Peck as ethnographer===
While at Baffin Island&#x27;s Blacklead Island mission, Peck carefully documented the lives of the Inuit.

Kenn Harper observes, &quot;Missionaries are not usually ethnographers. Most view their task as to eradicate, rather than document, the &quot;heathen&quot; beliefs of pre-Christian times. Peck might very well have fallen into this camp too, had it not been for the invitation of the pioneer anthropologist, Franz Boas, to document for him the belief system of the Inuit, collect legends and write up shamanic rituals.&quot; Edmund Peck did this for Boas, but his ethnographic notes of Inuit life have sat largely untouched and unrecognized for over a century in the General Synod Archives of the Anglican Church of Canada. They were finally published in 2006.

==Ottawa (1905–1924)==

In 1905, Peck and his family moved to Ottawa where he served as Superintendent of Arctic Missions. He traveled North occasionally on supply vessels in the summer.

<doc id="379291" wikidata="Q2274646" url="?curid=379291" title="Inuktitut syllabics">
<text>Inuktitut syllabics (, or , ) is an abugida-type writing system used in Canada by the Inuktitut-speaking Inuit of the territory of Nunavut and the Nunavik and Nunatsiavut regions of Quebec and Labrador, respectively. In 1976, the Language Commission of the Inuit Cultural Institute made it the co-official script for the Inuit languages, along with the Latin script.

The name &#x27; derives from the root , meaning &quot;mouth&quot;. The alternative, Latin-based writing system is named  (), and it derives from , a word describing the markings or the grain in rocks. &#x27; meaning &quot;new writing system&quot; is to be seen in contrast to (), the &quot;old syllabics&quot; used before the reforms of 1976.

Inuktitut is one variation on Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, and can be digitally encoded using the Unicode standard. The Unicode block for Inuktitut characters is called Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics.

==History==
The first efforts to write Inuktitut came from Moravian missionaries in Greenland and Labrador in the mid-19th century using Latin script. The first book printed in Inuktitut using Cree script was an 8-page pamphlet known as &quot;Selections from the Gospels in the dialect of the Inuit of Little Whale River&quot; (, &quot;Jesus&#x27; words&quot;), printed by John Horden in 1855–56 at Moose Factory for Edwin Arthur Watkins to use among the Inuit at Fort George. In November 1865, Horden and Watkins met in London under Henry Venn&#x27;s direction to adapt Cree syllabics to the Inuktitut language. In the 1870s, Edmund Peck, another Anglican missionary, started printing according to that standard. Other missionaries, and later linguists in the employ of the Canadian and American governments, adapted the Latin alphabet to the dialects of the Mackenzie River delta, the western Arctic islands and Alaska.

==Table==

The Inuktitut script () is commonly presented as a syllabary. The dots on the letters in the table mark long vowels; in the Latin transcription, the vowel is doubled. For geminate consonants, the final consonant symbol is placed before the CV syllabic, for instance &quot;-kku-, -nnu-&quot; are rendered ᒃᑯ and ᓐᓄ respectively.

:&quot;Note: An image of the chart is also available.&quot;


==Modifications==
The Makivik Corporation expanded the official version of the script to restore the &quot;ai-pai-tai&quot; column. The common diphthong &quot;ai&quot; has generally been represented by combining the &quot;a&quot; form with a stand-alone letter ᐃ &quot;i.&quot; This fourth-vowel variant had been removed so that Inuktitut could be typed and printed using IBM Selectric balls in the 1970s. The reinstatement was justified on the grounds that modern printing and typesetting equipment no longer suffers the restrictions of earlier typewriting machinery. The &quot;ai-pai-tai&quot; column is used only in Nunavik.

<doc id="379295" wikidata="Q4468" url="?curid=379295" title="Gobiidae">
<text>Gobiidae or gobies is a family of bony fish in the order Gobiiformes, one of the largest fish families comprising more than 2,000 species in more than 200 genera. Most of gobiid fish are relatively small, typically less than in length, and the family includes some of the smallest vertebrates in the world, such as &quot;Trimmatom nanus&quot; and &quot;Pandaka pygmaea&quot;, &quot;Trimmatom nanus&quot; are under long when fully grown, then &quot;Pandaka pygmaea&quot; standard length are , maximum known standard length are . Some large gobies can reach over in length, but that is exceptional. Generally, they are benthic or bottom-dwellers. Although few are important as food fish for humans, they are of great significance as prey species for other commercially important fish such as cod, haddock, sea bass and flatfish. Several gobiids are also of interest as aquarium fish, such as the dartfish of the genus &quot;Ptereleotris&quot;. Phylogenetic relationships of gobiids have been studied using molecular data.

==Description==

The most distinctive aspects of gobiid morphology are the fused pelvic fins that form a disc-shaped sucker. This sucker is functionally analogous to the dorsal fin sucker possessed by the remoras or the pelvic fin sucker of the lumpsuckers, but is anatomically distinct; these similarities are the product of convergent evolution. The species in this family can often be seen using the sucker to adhere to rocks and corals, and in aquariums they will stick to glass walls of the tank, as well.

==Distribution and habitat==
Gobiidae are spread all over the world in tropical and temperate near shore-marine, brackish, and freshwater environments. Their range extends from the Old World coral reefs to the seas of the New World, and includes the rivers and near-shore habitats of Europe and Asia. Gobies are generally bottom-dwellers. Although many live in burrows, a few species (e.g. in the genus &quot;Glossogobius&quot;) are true cavefish. On coral reefs, species of gobiids constitute 35% of the total number of fishes and 20% of the species diversity.

==Subfamilies==

The family Gobiidae underwent a major revision in the 5th edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;. Before the revision the Gobiidae contained six subfamilies: Gobiinae, Benthophilinae, Amblyopinae, Gobionellinae, Oxudercinae, and Sicydiinae. The revision retained the first two subfamilies and removed the other four to a separate family, the Oxudercidae. In addition, species formerly placed in the families Kraemeriidae, Microdesmidae, Ptereleotridae and Schindleriidae were added to the revised Gobiidae, although no subfamilies were described.

The two formerly recognised subfamilies where the species have been retained in Gobiidae in the 5th Edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot;:

===Benthophilinae===

Members of Benthophilinae are endemic to the Ponto-Caspian region (including the Marmara, Black, Azov, Caspian, and Aral Seas). The representatives of the subfamily have fused pelvic fins and elongated dorsal and anal fins. They are distinguished from the closely related subfamily Gobiinae by the absence of a swimbladder in adults and location of the uppermost rays of the pectoral fins within the fin membrane. Its members include tadpole gobies, monkey gobies, and bighead gobies.

===Gobiinae===

Members of the Gobiinae are known as true gobies. It is the most widespread and most diverse of the subfamilies formerly recognised under the Gobiidae, containing around 2000 species and 150 genera.

==Ecology and biology==

Gobiids are primarily fish of shallow marine habitats, including tide pools, coral reefs, and seagrass meadows; they are also very numerous in brackish water and estuarine habitats, including the lower reaches of rivers, mangrove swamps, and salt marshes. A few gobiid species (unknown exactly, but in the low hundreds) are also fully adapted to freshwater environments. These include the round goby (&quot;Neogobius melanostomus&quot;), Australian desert goby (&quot;Chlamydogobius eremius&quot;), and the European freshwater goby &quot;Padogobius bonelli&quot;. Most gobies feed on small invertebrates, although some of the larger species eat other fish, and a few eat planktonic algae.

==Reproduction==
Most species in the Gobiidae attach their eggs to a substrate, such as vegetation, coral, or a rock surface. They lay from five to a few thousand eggs, depending on the species. After fertilizing the eggs, the male guards the eggs from predators and keep them free from detritus. The male fans the eggs, thereby providing them with oxygen. The female maintains the burrow. The eggs hatch after a few days. The larvae are born transparent, and they develop coloration after spreading to find a suitable habitat. The larvae of many freshwater gobiid species are carried downstream to the brackish waters, or even to the sea. They return to fresh water weeks or months later.

Gobiids in warmer waters reach adulthood in a few months, while gobies in cooler environments reach adulthood in two years. The total lifespan of gobiid varies from one to ten years, again with the species in warmer waters generally living longer.

==Behavior==

===Burrow construction===
Many species in the Gobiidae live in male-female pairs that construct and share burrows, similar to many other fish such as Mozambique tilapia. The burrows are used for shelters and spawning places. Gobiids use their mouths to dig into the sea bottom, removing dead coral-fragments, rubble, and benthic algae in order to build their burrows. Gobiids maintain their burrows by fanning away sand inside the burrows. Furthermore, gobies use coral rubble to block burrow entrance. A single goby carry as many as nine pieces of coral rubble per minute. Gobiids also build a 6–13 cm high mound over the entrance of their spawning burrow. The mound lets the water flow fast over the mound. The water flow created by the mound helps to provide oxygen to the eggs. While burrow building is a cooperative behavior done by both sexes, males usually put more effort in burrow maintenance than females. Females feed more instead, because the reproductive success is optimal when females put more energy in preparing for the reproduction. After spawning eggs, the roles of male and female changes. Females primarily maintain the burrow, and males mainly care for the eggs by fanning them, thereby providing oxygen. When females leave the burrow, however, the mounds lose their heights. The males then give up on the eggs and eat them, preparing for future mating opportunities. Gobiid burrows vary in size depending on the size of the species.

===Kleptogamy===
Kleptogamy refers to a &quot;sneaking behavior&quot; during reproduction where an unpaired male fertilises the eggs of a paired female and the paired male cares for the eggs. Females prefer male gobies with large bodies. Since not all males have large bodies, the smaller ones may cheat instead of expending energy to find mates. The sneakers wait near the spawning ground of paired fish. The sneakers then release their sperm on the spawning ground as soon as the paired female releases her eggs. Though sneakers’ sperm fertilizes some eggs, the paired male cannot distinguish the eggs fertilized by the sneakers from those fertilized by his own sperm. Therefore, the paired male gives parental care equally to all the eggs.

Kleptogamy is a good strategy in many ways. First, the sneakers do not need their own territories, indicating that they do not need to spend energy in protecting territories, as most other males do. Most male gobies need their own territories, since females do not choose to mate with a male that does not own his own territory. Secondly, the sneakers do not provide parental care to their eggs. The paired males provide parental care instead of the sneakers. Therefore, the sneakers can save energy, and they can put more effort into finding new targets for cheating.

The cost of kleptogamy is that the sneakers can receive aggressive attacks from the paired males that are usually much larger and stronger than the sneakers. For small sneakers, the attacks by the paired males can be detrimental and often lead to death.

The sneakers are also referred to as pseudo-females, since they are small and hardly distinguishable from females. This small body size makes cheating easier. Most of the time the paired males mistake the sneakers for females and thus do not chase the sneakers away. The paired males are called &quot;bourgeois&quot; males, because they are larger, stronger, and most importantly, paired.
===Sex change===
A few species of gobiid, such as blackeye goby and &quot;Lythrypnus dalli&quot;, can change their sexes. Sex change is possible in these gobies, since the external genitalia for males and females do not differ much. Sex changes can take from days to weeks. Most sex changes in gobies are from female to male (protogyny) rather than male to female (protandry). Female-to-male changes are observed not only in gobiids but also in wrasses, damselfishes, and sea basses. Female-to-male change usually occurs because the resident male of the group is dead. If no male is in the group, reproduction will be impossible. Therefore, the dominant female turns into male, allowing mating to happen. Male-to-female change occurs when the females have preference for specific features in males. For example, females prefer large males, and a few large males mate with multiple females, whereas small males lose their chance to mate. Small males either choose to become sneakers (kleptogamy) or choose to transform into females because all females technically have high mating opportunities. By turning into females, males can ensure that they produce many offspring.

Some gobies have extraordinarily developed sex change ability. &quot;Gobiodon histrio&quot; from the Great Barrier Reef exhibits bidirectional sex changes. &quot;G. histrio&quot; is one of the very few species that can change sex in both ways. When two &quot;G. historio&quot; females, which used to be males, are on the same coral reef, one of them transforms back into a male goby.

===Sex determination===
Sex determination in coral goby &quot;Gobiodon erythrospilus&quot; does not occur until the juveniles meet potential mates. Confronting a potential mate can be difficult for &quot;Gobiodon erythrospilus&quot; juveniles, since most coral resources, crucial for attracting mates, are occupied by pre-existing paired gobies. Juveniles can only meet potential mates when one member of the pre-existing pairs dies. Juveniles’ sexes are determined according to the sexes of their potential mates. When a juvenile meets a female, it becomes a male, and vice versa. This type of sex determination is referred to as socially influenced sex determination.

===Navigation===
Some gobiids remember landmarks that are within short distances, and use them to find their ways. Small frillfin gobies (&quot;Bathygobius soporator&quot;) live in intertidal zones. They swim through the pools during high tides and memorize how each pool connects to the others. Then, during low tides, they can exhibit accurate jumping behaviors, as they have memorized the paths. In a new environment, these fish do not show jumping behaviors or jump into wrong pools. Nevertheless, after one night, they show the same accurate jumping behaviors.

===Habitat choice===
A study was done to understand how gobiids react to changing habitat. The fish were given two choices: a safe habitat with less food and a dangerous habitat with more food. Results from both the full and hungry fish revealed that gobiids, when confronted with the trade-off between foraging and avoiding predation, made choices that would better their foraging.
===Symbiosis===
Species in the Gobiidae sometimes form symbiotic relationships with other species, such as with burrowing shrimps. The shrimp maintains a burrow in the sand in which both the shrimp and the fish live. The shrimp has poor eyesight compared to the gobiid, but if it sees or feels the fish suddenly swim into the burrow, it will follow. The fish and shrimp keep in contact with each other, the shrimp using its antennae, and the fish flicking the shrimp with its tail when alarmed. These gobiids are thus sometimes known as &quot;watchmen gobies&quot; or &quot;prawn gobies&quot;. Each party gains from this relationship: the shrimp gets a warning of approaching danger, and the fish gets a safe home and a place to lay its eggs. Only the alpha male and female reproduce; other fish in the colony eat sparingly to resist being eaten by the alpha male or female. This way, only the largest and fittest are able to reproduce.

Another example of symbiosis is demonstrated by the neon gobies (&quot;Elacatinus&quot; spp.). These gobiids, known as &quot;cleaner gobies&quot;, remove parasites from the skin, fins, mouth, and gills of a wide variety of large fish. The most remarkable aspect of this symbiosis is many of the fish that visit the cleaner gobies&#x27; cleaning stations would otherwise treat such small fish as food (for example, groupers and snapper). Again, this is a relationship where both parties gain: the gobies get a continual supply of food as bigger fish visit their cleaning stations, and the bigger fish leave the cleaning stations healthier than they were when they arrived.

Another form of symbiosis exists between gobiids and the mushroom coral &quot;Heliofungia actiniformis&quot; (Fungiidae), in which representatives of the genus &quot;Eviota&quot; roam among the tentacles possibly hiding from predators.

==Commercial importance==

Gobiids have commercial importance in Russia and Ukraine. They are fished in the Sea of Azov, northwestern Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Most important species are round goby, monkey goby, toad goby, and grass goby. The grass goby is also a commercial fish in Italy.

===In the aquarium===
Several species of gobiids are kept in aquaria. Most captive gobies are marine. Perhaps the most popular is the small but colorful neon goby. Most gobies stay toward the lower portion of the aquarium, hiding in the rockwork, but some species (most notably the shrimp gobies) prefer to dig themselves little burrows. Aquarists typically provide them with a fine-grained substrate to prevent damage to their delicate undersides.
Commonly kept saltwater species include Randall&#x27;s shrimp goby and the watchman goby.

<text>The Washington State History Museum is a history museum located in downtown Tacoma, Washington, United States. It is operated by the Washington State Historical Society under the official approval of the Washington State Legislature. The museum opened on August 10, 1996, at a building adjacent to historic Union Station that cost $42 million to construct.

==History==
Designed by the postmodern architect Charles Moore who &quot;insisted that buildings reflect their setting and their purpose&quot;. Opened in August 1996, the state spent five years in construction and preparing for the grand opening.

The grounds of the museum are set in a garden that reflects &quot;the character of the entire state&quot; with &quot;dramatic circles and slopes ... sweeping circular ramp [which] suggests a Cascade mountain switchback, while a dished-out amphitheater seating over 200 people represents the Puget Sound&quot;.

==Exhibits==

===Permanent exhibits===

Permanent exhibits feature Boeing history, a Southern Coast Salish plank house, maritime history and information about George Vancouver. Artifacts from the Clovis culture are the oldest objects to be found in the museum.

The top floor is also home to the state&#x27;s largest permanent model train layout, which covers and recreates scenes from Tacoma&#x27;s Union Station (which is located next to the museum) and other regional railroads. The museum hosts an annual Model Train Festival in December. Model train clubs set up &quot;elaborate displays&quot; in the museum, the festival runs until the first week of January.

===Temporary exhibits===

In 2000 the museum celebrated the 100th anniversary of Mount Rainier National Park with the exhibit &quot;Sunrise to Paradise: The Story of Mount Rainier National Park&quot;. The 5,500 square foot exhibit showed the park as an active icon in the natural world, as well as its cultural significance in the region.

The traveling exhibit of Native American quilts from 1920 to 1996 was a temporary exhibit at the museum in July 2000. The quilts were displayed in settings such as on beds to showcase the stories depicted on each quilt. The exhibit was called &quot;To Honor and Comfort: Native Quilting Traditions&quot; and featured 45 North American and Hawaiian quilts.

<doc id="379302" wikidata="Q211891" url="?curid=379302" title="Nitrous acid">
<text>Nitrous acid (molecular formula ) is a weak and monoprotic acid known only in solution, in the gas phase, and in the form of nitrite () salts. It was discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who called it &quot;phlogisticated acid of niter&quot;. Nitrous acid is used to make diazonium salts from amines. The resulting diazonium salts are reagents in azo coupling reactions to give azo dyes.

==Structure==
In the gas phase, the planar nitrous acid molecule can adopt both a &quot;syn&quot; and an &quot;anti&quot; form. The &quot;anti&quot; form predominates at room temperature, and IR measurements indicate it is more stable by around 2.3 kJ/mol.

==Preparation and decomposition==
Free, gaseous nitrous acid is unstable, rapidly disproportionating to nitric oxides:
:2 HNO2 → NO2 + NO + H2O
In aqueous solution, the nitrogen dioxide also disproportionates, for a net reaction producing nitric oxide and nitric acid: 
:3 HNO2 → 2 NO + HNO3 + 

Consequently applications of nitrous acid usually begin with mineral acid acidification of sodium nitrite. The acidification is usually conducted at ice temperatures, and the HNO2 consumed &quot;in situ&quot;.

Nitrous acid equilibrates with dinitrogen trioxide in water, so that concentrated solutions are visibly blue:
: N2O3 + H2O 2 HNO2
Addition of dinitrogen trioxide to water is thus another preparatory technique.

==Chemical applications==
Nitrous acid is the main chemophore in the Liebermann reagent, used to spot-test for alkaloids.

At high acidities (), nitrous acid is protonated to give water and nitrosonium cations. 

===Reduction===
With I− and Fe2+ ions, NO is formed:

: 2 HNO2 + 2 KI + 2 H2SO4 → I2 + 2 NO + 2 H2O + 2 K2SO4
: 2 HNO2 + 2 FeSO4 + 2 H2SO4 → Fe2(SO4)3 + 2 NO + 2 H2O + K2SO4

With Sn2+ ions, N2O is formed:

: 2 HNO2 + 6 HCl + 2 SnCl2 → 2 SnCl4 + N2O + 3 H2O + 2 KCl

With SO2 gas, NH2OH is formed:

: 2 HNO2 + 6 H2O + 4 SO2 → 3 H2SO4 + K2SO4 + 2 NH2OH

With Zn in alkali solution, NH3 is formed:

: 5 H2O + KNO2 + 3 Zn → NH3 + KOH + 3 Zn(OH)2

With , both HN3 and (subsequently) N2 gas are formed:

: HNO2 + [N2H5]+ → HN3 + H2O + H3O+

: HNO2 + HN3 → N2O + N2 + H2O

Oxidation by nitrous acid has a kinetic control over thermodynamic control, this is best illustrated that dilute nitrous acid is able to oxidize I− to I2, but dilute nitric acid cannot.

: I2 + 2 e− ⇌ 2 I− &quot;E&quot;o = +0.54 V

: + 3 H+ + 2 e− ⇌ HNO2 + H2O &quot;E&quot;o = +0.93 V

: HNO2 + H+ + e− ⇌ NO + H2O &quot;E&quot;o = +0.98 V

It can be seen that the values of &quot;E&quot; for these reactions are similar, but nitric acid is a more powerful oxidizing agent. Based on the fact that dilute nitrous acid can oxidize iodide into iodine, it can be deduced that nitrous is a faster, rather than a more powerful, oxidizing agent than dilute nitric acid.

===Organic chemistry===
Nitrous acid is used to prepare diazonium salts:
:HNO2 + ArNH2 + H+ → + 2 H2O
where Ar is an aryl group.

Such salts are widely used in organic synthesis, e.g., for the Sandmeyer reaction and in the preparation azo dyes, brightly colored compounds that are the basis of a qualitative test for anilines. Nitrous acid is used to destroy toxic and potentially explosive sodium azide. For most purposes, nitrous acid is usually formed &quot;in situ&quot; by the action of mineral acid on sodium nitrite:
It is mainly blue in colour

: NaNO2 + HCl → HNO2 + NaCl
: 2 NaN3 + 2 HNO2 → 3 N2 + 2 NO + 2 NaOH

Reaction with two α-hydrogen atoms in ketones creates oximes, which may be further oxidized to a carboxylic acid, or reduced to form amines. This process is used in the commercial production of adipic acid.

Nitrous acid reacts rapidly with aliphatic alcohols to produce alkyl nitrites, which are potent vasodilators:

:(CH3)2CHCH2CH2OH + HNO2 → (CH3)2CHCH2CH2ONO + H2O

The carcinogens called nitrosamines are produced, usually not intentionally, by the reaction of nitrous acid with secondary amines:
:HNO2 + R2NH → R2N-NO + H2O

==Atmosphere of the Earth==
Nitrous acid is involved in the ozone budget of the lower atmosphere, the troposphere. The heterogeneous reaction of nitric oxide (NO) and water produces nitrous acid. When this reaction takes place on the surface of atmospheric aerosols, the product readily photolyses to hydroxyl radicals.

==DNA damage and mutation==

Treatment of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; cells with nitrous acid causes damage to the cell&#x27;s DNA including deamination of cytosine to uracil, and these damages are subject to repair by specific enzymes. Also, nitrous acid causes base substitution mutations in organisms with double-stranded DNA.

<doc id="379303" wikidata="Q1146120" url="?curid=379303" title="Gas exchange">
<text>Gas exchange is the physical process by which gases move passively by diffusion across a surface. For example, this surface might be the air/water interface of a water body, the surface of a gas bubble in a liquid, a gas-permeable membrane, or a biological membrane that forms the boundary between an organism and its extracellular environment.

Gases are constantly consumed and produced by cellular and metabolic reactions in most living things, so an efficient system for gas exchange between, ultimately, the interior of the cell(s) and the external environment is required. Small, particularly unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and protozoa, have a high surface-area to volume ratio. In these creatures the gas exchange membrane is typically the cell membrane. Some small multicellular organisms, such as flatworms, are also able to perform sufficient gas exchange across the skin or cuticle that surrounds their bodies. However, in most larger organisms, which have small surface-area to volume ratios, specialised structures with convoluted surfaces such as gills, pulmonary alveoli and spongy mesophylls provide the large area needed for effective gas exchange. These convoluted surfaces may sometimes be internalised into the body of the organism. This is the case with the alveoli, which form the inner surface of the mammalian lung, the spongy mesophyll, which is found inside the leaves of some kinds of plant, or the gills of those molluscs that have them, which are found in the mantle cavity.

In aerobic organisms, gas exchange is particularly important for respiration, which involves the uptake of oxygen () and release of carbon dioxide (). Conversely, in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms such as most land plants, uptake of carbon dioxide and release of both oxygen and water vapour are the main gas-exchange processes occurring during the day. Other gas-exchange processes are important in less familiar organisms: &quot;e.g.&quot; carbon dioxide, methane and hydrogen are exchanged across the cell membrane of methanogenic archaea. In nitrogen fixation by diazotrophic bacteria, and denitrification by heterotrophic bacteria (such as &quot;Paracoccus denitrificans&quot; and various pseudomonads), nitrogen gas is exchanged with the environment, being taken up by the former and released into it by the latter, while giant tube worms rely on bacteria to oxidize hydrogen sulfide extracted from their deep sea environment, using dissolved oxygen in the water as an electron acceptor.

Diffusion only takes place with a concentration gradient. Gases will flow from a high concentration to a low concentration.
A high oxygen concentration in the alveoli and low oxygen concentration in the capillaries causes oxygen to move into the capillaries.
A high carbon dioxide concentration in the capillaries and low carbon dioxide concentration in the alveoli causes carbon dioxide to move into the alveoli.

==Physical principles of gas-exchange==

===Diffusion and surface area===

The exchange of gases occurs as a result of diffusion down a concentration gradient. Gas molecules move from a region in which they are at high concentration to one in which they are at low concentration. Diffusion is a passive process, meaning that no energy is required to power the transport, and it follows Fick&#x27;s law: 

:formula_1

In relation to a typical biological system, where two compartments (&#x27;inside&#x27; and &#x27;outside&#x27;), are separated by a membrane barrier, and where a gas is allowed to spontaneously diffuse down its concentration gradient:
* &quot;J&quot; is the flux, the amount of gas diffusing per unit area of membrane per unit time. Note that this is already scaled for the area of the membrane.
* &quot;D&quot; is the diffusion coefficient, which will differ from gas to gas, and from membrane to membrane, according to the size of the gas molecule in question, and the nature of the membrane itself (particularly its viscosity, temperature and hydrophobicity).
* &quot;φ&quot; is the concentration of the gas.
* &quot;x&quot; is the position across the thickness of the membrane.
* d&quot;φ&quot;/d&quot;x&quot; is therefore the concentration gradient across the membrane. If the two compartments are individually well-mixed, then this is simplifies to the difference in concentration of the gas between the inside and outside compartments divided by the thickness of the membrane.
* The negative sign indicates that the diffusion is always in the direction that - over time - will destroy the concentration gradient, &quot;i.e.&quot; the gas moves from high concentration to low concentration until eventually the inside and outside compartments reach equilibrium.

Gases must first dissolve in a liquid in order to diffuse across a membrane, so all biological gas exchange systems require a moist environment. In general, the higher the concentration gradient across the gas-exchanging surface, the faster the rate of diffusion across it. Conversely, the thinner the gas-exchanging surface (for the same concentration difference), the faster the gases will diffuse across it.

In the equation above, &quot;J&quot; is the flux expressed per unit area, so increasing the area will make no difference to its value. However, an increase in the available surface area, will increase the &quot;amount&quot; of gas that can diffuse in a given time. This is because the amount of gas diffusing per unit time (d&quot;q&quot;/d&quot;t&quot;) is the product of &quot;J&quot; and the area of the gas-exchanging surface, &quot;A&quot;:

:formula_2

Single-celled organisms such as bacteria and amoebae do not have specialised gas exchange surfaces, because they can take advantage of the high surface area they have relative to their volume. The amount of gas an organism produces (or requires) in a given time will be in rough proportion to the volume of its cytoplasm. The volume of a unicellular organism is very small; thus, it produces (and requires) a relatively small amount of gas in a given time. In comparison to this small volume, the surface area of its cell membrane is very large, and adequate for its gas-exchange needs without further modification. However, as an organism increases in size, its surface area and volume do not scale in the same way. Consider an imaginary organism that is a cube of side-length, &quot;L&quot;. Its volume increases with the cube (&quot;L&quot;3) of its length, but its external surface area increases only with the square (&quot;L&quot;2) of its length. This means the external surface rapidly becomes inadequate for the rapidly increasing gas-exchange needs of a larger volume of cytoplasm. Additionally, the thickness of the surface that gases must cross (d&quot;x&quot; in Fick&#x27;s law) can also be larger in larger organisms: in the case of a single-celled organism, a typical cell membrane is only 10 nm thick; but in larger organisms such as roundworms (Nematoda) the equivalent exchange surface - the cuticle - is substantially thicker at 0.5 μm.

===Interaction with circulatory systems===

In multicellular organisms therefore, specialised respiratory organs such as gills or lungs are often used to provide the additional surface area for the required rate of gas exchange with the external environment. However the distances between the gas exchanger and the deeper tissues are often too great for diffusion to meet gaseous requirements of these tissues. The gas exchangers are therefore frequently coupled to gas-distributing circulatory systems, which transport the gases evenly to all the body tissues regardless of their distance from the gas exchanger.

Some multicellular organisms such as flatworms (Platyhelminthes) are relatively large but very thin, allowing their outer body surface to act as a gas exchange surface without the need for a specialised gas exchange organ. Flatworms therefore lack gills or lungs, and also lack a circulatory system. Other multicellular organisms such as sponges (Porifera) have an inherently high surface area, because they are very porous and/or branched. Sponges do not require a circulatory system or specialised gas exchange organs, because their feeding strategy involves one-way pumping of water through their porous bodies using flagellated collar cells. Each cell of the sponge&#x27;s body is therefore exposed to a constant flow of fresh oxygenated water. They can therefore rely on diffusion across their cell membranes to carry out the gas exchange needed for respiration.

In organisms that have circulatory systems associated with their specialized gas-exchange surfaces, a great variety of systems are used for the interaction between the two.

In a countercurrent flow system, air (or, more usually, the water containing dissolved air) is drawn in the &quot;opposite&quot; direction to the flow of blood in the gas exchanger. A countercurrent system such as this maintains a steep concentration gradient along the length of the gas-exchange surface (see lower diagram in Fig. 2). This is the situation seen in the gills of fish and many other aquatic creatures. The gas-containing environmental water is drawn unidirectionally across the gas-exchange surface, with the blood-flow in the gill capillaries beneath flowing in the opposite direction. Although this theoretically allows almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas from one side of the exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.

Alternative arrangements are cross current systems found in birds. and dead-end air-filled sac systems found in the lungs of mammals. In a cocurrent flow system, the blood and gas (or the fluid containing the gas) move in the same direction through the gas exchanger. This means the magnitude of the gradient is variable along the length of the gas-exchange surface, and the exchange will eventually stop when an equilibrium has been reached (see upper diagram in Fig. 2).
Cocurrent flow gas exchange systems are not known to be used in nature.

==Mammals==
The gas exchanger in mammals is internalized to form lungs, as it is in most of the larger land animals. Gas exchange occurs in microscopic dead-end air-filled sacs called alveoli, where a very thin membrane (called the blood-air barrier) separates the blood in the alveolar capillaries (in the walls of the alveoli) from the alveolar air in the sacs.
== Exchange membrane ==

The membrane across which gas exchange takes place in the alveoli (i.e. the blood-air barrier) is extremely thin (in humans, on average, 2.2 μm thick). It consists of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries (Fig. 4). The large surface area of the membrane comes from the folding of the membrane into about 300 million alveoli, with diameters of approximately 75–300 μm each. This provides an extremely large surface area (approximately 145 m2) across which gas exchange can occur.

===Alveolar air===


Air is brought to the alveoli in small doses (called the tidal volume), by breathing in (inhalation) and out (exhalation) through the respiratory airways, a set of relatively narrow and moderately long tubes which start at the nose or mouth and end in the alveoli of the lungs in the chest. Air moves in and out through the same set of tubes, in which the flow is in one direction during inhalation, and in the opposite direction during exhalation.

During each inhalation, at rest, approximately 500 ml of fresh air flows in through the nose. It is warmed and moistened as it flows through the nose and pharynx. By the time it reaches the trachea the inhaled air&#x27;s temperature is 37 °C and it is saturated with water vapor. On arrival in the alveoli it is diluted and thoroughly mixed with the approximately 2.5–3.0 liters of air that remained in the alveoli after the last exhalation. This relatively large volume of air that is semi-permanently present in the alveoli throughout the breathing cycle is known as the functional residual capacity (FRC).

At the beginning of inhalation the airways are filled with unchanged alveolar air, left over from the last exhalation. This is the dead space volume, which is usually about 150 ml. It is the first air to re-enter the alveoli during inhalation. Only after the dead space air has returned to the alveoli does the remainder of the tidal volume (500 ml - 150 ml = 350 ml) enter the alveoli. The entry of such a small volume of fresh air with each inhalation, ensures that the composition of the FRC hardly changes during the breathing cycle (Fig. 5). The alveolar partial pressure of oxygen remains very close to 13–14 kPa (100 mmHg), and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide varies minimally around 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg) throughout the breathing cycle (of inhalation and exhalation). The corresponding partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the ambient (dry) air at sea level are 21 kPa (160 mmHg) and 0.04 kPa (0.3 mmHg) respectively.
This alveolar air, which constitutes the FRC, completely surrounds the blood in the alveolar capillaries (Fig. 6). Gas exchange in mammals occurs between this alveolar air (which differs significantly from fresh air) and the blood in the alveolar capillaries. The gases on either side of the gas exchange membrane equilibrate by simple diffusion. This ensures that the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood leaving the alveolar capillaries, and ultimately circulates throughout the body, are the same as those in the FRC.

The marked difference between the composition of the alveolar air and that of the ambient air can be maintained because the functional residual capacity is contained in dead-end sacs connected to the outside air by long, narrow, tubes (the airways: nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and their branches and sub-branches down to the bronchioles). This anatomy, and the fact that the lungs are not emptied and re-inflated with each breath, provides mammals with a &quot;portable atmosphere&quot;, whose composition differs significantly from the present-day ambient air.

The composition of the air in the FRC is carefully monitored, by measuring the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. If either gas pressure deviates from normal, reflexes are elicited that change the rate and depth of breathing in such a way that normality is restored within seconds or minutes.

===Pulmonary circulation===

All the blood returning from the body tissues to the right side of the heart flows through the alveolar capillaries before being pumped around the body again. On its passage through the lungs the blood comes into close contact with the alveolar air, separated from it by a very thin diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2 μm thick. The gas pressures in the blood will therefore rapidly equilibrate with those in the alveoli, ensuring that the arterial blood that circulates to all the tissues throughout the body has an oxygen tension of 13−14 kPa (100 mmHg), and a carbon dioxide tension of 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg). These arterial partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial formula_3, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial formula_3, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing until the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced until blood gas normality is restored.

Since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a formula_3 of, on average, 6 kPa (45 mmHg), while the pressure in the alveolar air is 13 kPa (100 mmHg), there will be a net diffusion of oxygen into the capillary blood, changing the composition of the 3 liters of alveolar air slightly. Similarly, since the blood arriving in the alveolar capillaries has a formula_3 of also about 6 kPa (45 mmHg), whereas that of the alveolar air is 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg), there is a net movement of carbon dioxide out of the capillaries into the alveoli. The changes brought about by these net flows of individual gases into and out of the functional residual capacity necessitate the replacement of about 15% of the alveolar air with ambient air every 5 seconds or so. This is very tightly controlled by the continuous monitoring of the arterial blood gas tensions (which accurately reflect partial pressures of the respiratory gases in the alveolar air) by the aortic bodies, the carotid bodies, and the blood gas and pH sensor on the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata in the brain. There are also oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors in the lungs, but they primarily determine the diameters of the bronchioles and pulmonary capillaries, and are therefore responsible for directing the flow of air and blood to different parts of the lungs.

It is only as a result of accurately maintaining the composition of the 3 liters alveolar air that with each breath some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, respiration will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar formula_3 has returned to 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg). It is therefore strictly speaking untrue that the primary function of the respiratory system is to rid the body of carbon dioxide &quot;waste&quot;. In fact the total concentration of carbon dioxide in arterial blood is about 26 mM (or 58 ml per 100 ml), compared to the concentration of oxygen in saturated arterial blood of about 9 mM (or 20 ml per 100 ml blood). This large concentration of carbon dioxide plays a pivotal role in the determination and maintenance of the pH of the extracellular fluids. The carbon dioxide that is breathed out with each breath could probably be more correctly be seen as a byproduct of the body&#x27;s extracellular fluid carbon dioxide and pH homeostats

If these homeostats are compromised, then a respiratory acidosis, or a respiratory alkalosis will occur. In the long run these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the H+ and HCO3− concentrations in the plasma; but since this takes time, the hyperventilation syndrome can, for instance, occur when agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus blowing off too much CO2 from the blood into the outside air, precipitating a set of distressing symptoms which result from an excessively high pH of the extracellular fluids.

Oxygen has a very low solubility in water, and is therefore carried in the blood loosely combined with hemoglobin. The oxygen is held on the hemoglobin by four ferrous iron-containing heme groups per hemoglobin molecule. When all the heme groups carry one O2 molecule each the blood is said to be &quot;saturated&quot; with oxygen, and no further increase in the partial pressure of oxygen will meaningfully increase the oxygen concentration of the blood. Most of the carbon dioxide in the blood is carried as HCO3− ions in the plasma. However the conversion of dissolved CO2 into HCO3− (through the addition of water) is too slow for the rate at which the blood circulates through the tissues on the one hand, and alveolar capillaries on the other. The reaction is therefore catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme inside the red blood cells. The reaction can go in either direction depending on the prevailing partial pressure of carbon dioxide. A small amount of carbon dioxide is carried on the protein portion of the hemoglobin molecules as carbamino groups. The total concentration of carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate ions, dissolved CO2, and carbamino groups) in arterial blood (i.e. after it has equilibrated with the alveolar air) is about 26 mM (or 58 ml/100 ml), compared to the concentration of oxygen in saturated arterial blood of about 9 mM (or 20 ml/100 ml blood).

==Other vertebrates==
===Fish===
The dissolved oxygen content in fresh water is approximately 8–10 milliliters per liter compared to that of air which is 210 milliliters per liter. Water is 800 times more dense than air and 100 times more viscous. Therefore, oxygen has a diffusion rate in air 10,000 times greater than in water. The use of sac-like lungs to remove oxygen from water would therefore not be efficient enough to sustain life. Rather than using lungs, gaseous exchange takes place across the surface of highly vascularized gills. Gills are specialised organs containing filaments, which further divide into lamellae. The lamellae contain capillaries that provide a large surface area and short diffusion distances, as their walls are extremely thin. Gill rakers are found within the exchange system in order to filter out food, and keep the gills clean.

Gills use a countercurrent flow system that increases the efficiency of oxygen-uptake (and waste gas loss). Oxygenated water is drawn in through the mouth and passes over the gills in one direction while blood flows through the lamellae in the opposite direction. This countercurrent maintains steep concentration gradients along the entire length of each capillary (see the diagram in the &quot;Interaction with circulatory systems&quot; section above). Oxygen is able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and the carbon dioxide down its gradient into the water. The deoxygenated water will eventually pass out through the operculum (gill cover). Although countercurrent exchange systems theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas from one side of the exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.

===Amphibians===
Amphibians have three main organs involved in gas exchange: the lungs, the skin, and the gills, which can be used singly or in a variety of different combinations. The relative importance of these structures differs according to the age, the environment and species of the amphibian. The skin of amphibians and their larvae are highly vascularised, leading to relatively efficient gas exchange when the skin is moist. The larvae of amphibians, such as the pre-metamorphosis tadpole stage of frogs, also have external gills. The gills are absorbed into the body during metamorphosis, after which the lungs will then take over. The lungs are usually simpler than in the other land vertebrates, with few internal septa and larger alveoli; however, toads, which spend more time on land, have a larger alveolar surface with more developed lungs. To increase the rate of gas exchange by diffusion, amphibians maintain the concentration gradient across the respiratory surface using a process called buccal pumping. The lower floor of the mouth is moved in a &quot;pumping&quot; manner, which can be observed by the naked eye.

===Reptiles===
All reptiles breathe using lungs. In squamates (the lizards and snakes) ventilation is driven by the axial musculature, but this musculature is also used during movement, so some squamates rely on buccal pumping to maintain gas exchange efficiency.

Due to the rigidity of turtle and tortoise shells, significant expansion and contraction of the chest is difficult. Turtles and tortoises depend on muscle layers attached to their shells, which wrap around their lungs to fill and empty them. Some aquatic turtles can also pump water into a highly vascularised mouth or cloaca to achieve gas-exchange.

Crocodiles have a structure similar to the mammalian diaphragm - the diaphragmaticus - but this muscle helps create a unidirectional flow of air through the lungs rather than a tidal flow: this is more similar to the air-flow seen in birds than that seen in mammals. During inhalation, the diaphragmaticus pulls the liver back, inflating the lungs into the space this creates. Air flows into the lungs from the bronchus during inhalation, but during exhalation, air flows out of the lungs into the bronchus by a different route: this one-way movement of gas is achieved by aerodynamic valves in the airways.

===Birds===

Birds have lungs but no diaphragm. They rely mostly on air sacs for ventilation. These air sacs do not play a direct role in gas exchange, but help to move air unidirectionally across the gas exchange surfaces in the lungs. During inhalation, fresh air is taken from the trachea down into the posterior air sacs and into the parabronchi which lead from the posterior air sacs into the lung. The air that enters the lungs joins the air which is already in the lungs, and is drawn forward across the gas exchanger into anterior air sacs. During exhalation, the posterior air sacs force air into the same parabronchi of the lungs, flowing in the same direction as during inhalation, allowing continuous gas exchange irrespective of the breathing cycle. Air exiting the lungs during exhalation joins the air being expelled from the anterior air sacs (both consisting of &quot;spent air&quot; that has passed through the gas exchanger) entering the trachea to be exhaled (Fig. 10). Selective bronchoconstriction at the various bronchial branch points ensures that the air does not ebb and flow through the bronchi during inhalation and exhalation, as it does in mammals, but follows the paths described above.

The unidirectional airflow through the parabronchi exchanges respiratory gases with a &quot;crosscurrent&quot; blood flow (Fig. 9). The partial pressure of O2 (formula_3) in the parabronchioles declines along their length as O2 diffuses into the blood. The capillaries leaving the exchanger near the entrance of airflow take up more O2 than capillaries leaving near the exit end of the parabronchi. When the contents of all capillaries mix, the final formula_3 of the mixed pulmonary venous blood is higher than that of the exhaled air, but lower than that of the inhaled air.

==Plants==
Gas exchange in plants is dominated by the roles of carbon dioxide, oxygen and water vapor. is the only carbon source for autotrophic growth by photosynthesis, and when a plant is actively photosynthesising in the light, it will be taking up carbon dioxide, and losing water vapor and oxygen. At night, plants respire, and gas exchange partly reverses: water vapor is still lost (but to a smaller extent), but oxygen is now taken up and carbon dioxide released.
Plant gas exchange occurs mostly through the leaves. Gas exchange between a leaf and the atmosphere occurs simultaneously through two pathways: 1) epidermal cells and cuticular waxes (usually referred as &#x27;cuticle&#x27;) which are always present at each leaf surface, and 2) stomata, which typically control the majority of the exchange. Gases enter into the photosynthetic tissue of the leaf through dissolution onto the moist surface of the palisade and spongy mesophyll cells. The spongy mesophyll cells are loosely packed, allowing for an increased surface area, and consequently an increased rate of gas-exchange. Uptake of carbon dioxide necessarily results in some loss of water vapor, because both molecules enter and leave by the same stomata, so plants experience a gas exchange dilemma: gaining enough without losing too much water. Therefore, water loss from other parts of the leaf is minimised by the waxy cuticle on the leaf&#x27;s epidermis. The size of a stoma is regulated by the opening and closing of its two guard cells: the turgidity of these cells determines the state of the stomatal opening, and this itself is regulated by water stress. Plants showing crassulacean acid metabolism are drought-tolerant xerophytes and perform almost all their gas-exchange at night, because it is only during the night that these plants open their stomata. By opening the stomata only at night, the water vapor loss associated with carbon dioxide uptake is minimised. However, this comes at the cost of slow growth: the plant has to store the carbon dioxide in the form of malic acid for use during the day, and it cannot store unlimited amounts.

Gas exchange measurements are important tools in plant science: this typically involves sealing the plant (or part of a plant) in a chamber and measuring changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide and water vapour with an infrared gas analyzer. If the environmental conditions (humidity, concentration, light and temperature) are fully controlled, the measurements of uptake and water release reveal important information about the assimilation and transpiration rates. The intercellular concentration reveals important information about the photosynthetic condition of the plants. Simpler methods can be used in specific circumstances: hydrogencarbonate indicator can be used to monitor the consumption of in a solution containing a single plant leaf at different levels of light intensity, and oxygen generation by the pondweed &quot;Elodea&quot; can be measured by simply collecting the gas in a submerged test-tube containing a small piece of the plant.

==Invertebrates==

The mechanism of gas exchange in invertebrates depends their size, feeding strategy, and habitat (aquatic or terrestrial).

The sponges (Porifera) are sessile creatures, meaning they are unable to move on their own and normally remain attached to their substrate. They obtain nutrients through the flow of water across their cells, and they exchange gases by simple diffusion across their cell membranes. Pores called ostia draw water into the sponge and the water is subsequently circulated through the sponge by cells called choanocytes which have hair-like structures that move the water through the sponge.

The cnidarians include corals, sea anemones, jellyfish and hydras. These animals are always found in aquatic environments, ranging from fresh water to salt water. They do not have any dedicated respiratory organs; instead, every cell in their body can absorb oxygen from the surrounding water, and release waste gases to it. One key disadvantage of this feature is that cnidarians can die in environments where water is stagnant, as they deplete the water of its oxygen supply. Corals often form symbiosis with other organisms, particularly photosynthetic dinoflagellates. In this symbiosis, the coral provides shelter and the other organism provides nutrients to the coral, including oxygen.

The roundworms (Nematoda), flatworms (Platyhelminthes), and many other small invertebrate animals living in aquatic or otherwise wet habitats do not have a dedicated gas-exchange surface or circulatory system. They instead rely on diffusion of and directly across their cuticle. The cuticle is the semi-permeable outermost layer of their bodies.

Other aquatic invertebrates such as most molluscs (Mollusca) and larger crustaceans (Crustacea) such as lobsters, have gills analogous to those of fish, which operate in a similar way.
Unlike the invertebrates groups mentioned so far, insects are usually terrestrial, and exchange gases across a moist surface in direct contact with the atmosphere, rather than in contact with surrounding water. The insect&#x27;s exoskeleton is impermeable to gases, including water vapor, so they have a more specialised gas exchange system, requiring gases to be directly transported to the tissues via a complex network of tubes. This respiratory system is separated from their circulatory system. Gases enter and leave the body through openings called spiracles, located laterally along the thorax and abdomen. Similar to plants, insects are able to control the opening and closing of these spiracles, but instead of relying on turgor pressure, they rely on muscle contractions. These contractions result in an insect&#x27;s abdomen being pumped in and out. The spiracles are connected to tubes called tracheae, which branch repeatedly and ramify into the insect&#x27;s body. These branches terminate in specialised tracheole cells which provides a thin, moist surface for efficient gas exchange, directly with cells.

The other main group of terrestrial arthropod, the arachnids (spiders, scorpion, mites, and their relatives) typically perform gas exchange with a book lung.

<text>Hortulus Animae (, , , ) was the Latin title of a prayer book also available in German. It was very popular in the early sixteenth century, printed in many versions, also abroad in Lyons and Kraków.

==History==
An earlier well-known work of devotion and of moral instruction, richly illustrated with stories, was &quot;Der Selen Würtzgart&quot;, first printed at Ulm in 1483. The meaning of the title is &quot;Herb garden of the Soul&quot;, which is similar to later titles.

The first known edition of &quot;Hortulus Animae&quot;, dated 13 March 1498, was printed at Strasbourg by Wilhelm Schaffener of Ribeauvillé (&quot;Rappschwihr&quot;), followed by German versions appearing in 1501. Later editions contained woodcuts by the well-known engravers Hans Springinklee and Erhard Schön, with beautiful miniatures in some existing manuscript examples, like the one at Vienna (Cod. Bibl. Pal. Vindobonensis. 2706, 1907), which has been reproduced as facsimile by Friedrich Dornhöffer. In 1501/1502, Sebastian Brant from Strasbourg translated it into German.

&quot;Hortulus Animae polonice&quot;, a Polish version written by Biernat of Lublin, printed and published in 1513 by Florian Ungler in Kraków, was believed to be the first book printed in the Polish language (it is the second). The last known copy was lost during World War II.

The work is mentioned briefly at the end of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s short story &quot;The Man of the Crowd.&quot;

<doc id="379307" wikidata="Q72157355" url="?curid=379307" title="Nitrite">
<text>The nitrite ion has the chemical formula . Nitrite (mostly sodium nitrite) is widely used throughout chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The nitrite anion is a pervasive intermediate in the nitrogen cycle in nature. The name nitrite also refers to organic compounds having the –ONO group, which are esters of nitrous acid.

==Production==
Sodium nitrite is made industrially by passing a mixture of nitrogen oxides into aqueous sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate solution:
:
The product is purified by recrystallization. Alkali metal nitrites are thermally stable up to and beyond their melting point (441 °C for KNO2). Ammonium nitrite can be made from dinitrogen trioxide, N2O3, which is formally the anhydride of nitrous acid:
:2 NH3 + H2O + N2O3 → 2 NH4NO2

== Structure ==
The nitrite ion has a symmetrical structure (C2v symmetry), with both N–O bonds having equal length and a bond angle of about 115°. In valence bond theory, it is described as a resonance hybrid with equal contributions from two canonical forms that are mirror images of each other. In molecular orbital theory, there is a sigma bond between each oxygen atom and the nitrogen atom, and a delocalized pi bond made from the p orbitals on nitrogen and oxygen atoms which is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. The negative charge of the ion is equally distributed on the two oxygen atoms. Both nitrogen and oxygen atoms carry a lone pair of electrons. Therefore, the nitrite ion is a Lewis base.

In the gas phase it exists predominantly as a &quot;trans&quot;-planar molecule.

==Reactions==
=== Acid-base properties ===
Nitrite is the conjugate base of the weak acid nitrous acid:
:HNO2 H+ + ; p&quot;K&quot;a ≈ 3.3 at 18 °C
Nitrous acid is also highly unstable, tending to disproportionate:
:3 HNO2 (aq) H3O+ + + 2 NO
This reaction is slow at 0 °C. Addition of acid to a solution of a nitrite in the presence of a reducing agent, such as iron(II), is a way to make nitric oxide (NO) in the laboratory.

=== Oxidation and reduction ===
The formal oxidation state of the nitrogen atom in nitrite is +3. This means that it can be either oxidized to oxidation states +4 and +5, or reduced to oxidation states as low as −3. Standard reduction potentials for reactions directly involving nitrous acid are shown in the table below: 
The data can be extended to include products in lower oxidation states. For example:
:H2N2O2 + 2 H+ + 2 &quot;e&quot;− N2 + 2 H2O; &quot;E&quot;0 = +2.65 V

Oxidation reactions usually result in the formation of the nitrate ion, with nitrogen in oxidation state +5. For example, oxidation with permanganate ion can be used for quantitative analysis of nitrite (by titration):
:5 + 2 + 6 H+ → 5 + 2 Mn2+ + 3 H2O

The product of reduction reactions with nitrite ion are varied, depending on the reducing agent used and its strength. With sulfur dioxide, the products are NO and N2O; with tin(II) (Sn2+) the product is hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2); reduction all the way to ammonia (NH3) occurs with hydrogen sulfide. With the hydrazinium cation () the product of nitrite reduction is hydrazoic acid (HN3), an unstable and explosive compound:

:HNO2 + → HN3 + H2O + H3O+
which can also further react with nitrite:
:HNO2 + HN3 → N2O + N2 + H2O

This reaction is unusual in that it involves compounds with nitrogen in four different oxidation states.

===Analysis of nitrite===

Nitrite is detected and analyzed by the Griess Reaction, involving the formation of a deep red-colored azo dye upon treatment of a -containing sample with sulfanilic acid and naphthyl-1-amine in the presence of acid.

=== Coordination complexes ===

Nitrite is an ambidentate ligand and can form a wide variety of coordination complexes by binding to metal ions in several ways. Two examples are the red nitrito complex [Co(NH3)5(ONO)]2+ is metastable, isomerizing to the yellow nitro complex [Co(NH3)5(NO2)]2+. Nitrite is processed by several enzymes, all of which utilize coordination complexes.

==Biochemistry==
In nitrification, ammonium is converted to nitrite. Important species include &quot;Nitrosomonas&quot;. Other bacterial species such as &quot;Nitrobacter&quot;, are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrite into nitrate.

Nitrite can be reduced to nitric oxide or ammonia by many species of bacteria. Under hypoxic conditions, nitrite may release nitric oxide, which causes potent vasodilation. Several mechanisms for nitrite conversion to NO have been described, including enzymatic reduction by xanthine oxidoreductase, nitrite reductase, and NO synthase (NOS), as well as nonenzymatic acidic disproportionation reactions.

==Uses==
===Chemical precursor===
Azo dyes and other colorants are prepared by the process called diazotization, which requires nitrite.

=== Nitrite in food preservation and biochemistry ===

The addition of nitrites and nitrates to processed meats such as ham, bacon, and sausages reduces growth and toxin production of &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;.
Sodium nitrite is used to speed up the curing of meat and also impart an attractive colour. On the other hand, a 2018 study by the British Meat Producers Association determined that legally permitted levels of nitrite do not affect the growth of &quot;C. botulinum&quot;. In the U.S., meat cannot be labeled as &quot;cured&quot; without the addition of nitrite. In some countries, cured-meat products are manufactured without nitrate or nitrite, and without nitrite from vegetable sources. Parma ham, produced without nitrite since 1993, was reported in 2018 to have caused no cases of botulism.

In mice, food rich in nitrites together with unsaturated fats can prevent hypertension by forming nitro fatty acids that inhibit soluble epoxide hydrolase, which is one explanation for the apparent health effect of the Mediterranean diet. Adding nitrites to meat has been shown to generate known carcinogens; the World Health Organization (WHO) advises that eating of nitrite processed meat a day would raise the risk of getting bowel cancer by 18% over a lifetime.

The recommended maximum limits by the World Health Organization in drinking water are 3 mg L−1 and 50 mg L−1 for nitrite and nitrate ions, respectively. Ingesting too much nitrite and/or nitrate through well water is suspected to cause methemoglobinemia.

95% of the nitrite ingested in modern diets comes from bacterial conversion of nitrates naturally found in vegetables. However, potentially cancer-causing nitroso compounds are not made in the pH-neutral colon. They are mostly made in the acidic stomach.

====Curing of meat====
Nitrite reacts with the meat&#x27;s myoglobin by attaching to the heme iron atom, forming reddish-brown nitrosomyoglobin and the characteristic pink &quot;fresh&quot; color of nitrosohemochrome or nitrosyl-heme upon cooking. In the US, nitrite has been formally used since 1925. According to scientists working for the industry group American Meat Institute, this use of nitrite started in the Middle Ages. Historians and epidemiologists argue that the widespread use of nitrite in meat-curing is closely linked to the development of industrial meat-processing. French investigative journalist asserts that the meat industry chooses to cure its meats with nitrite even though it is established that this chemical gives rise to cancer-causing nitroso-compounds. Some traditional and artisanal producers avoid nitrites.
Addition of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, or one of their salts enhance the binding of nitrite to the iron atom in myoglobin. These chemicals also reduce the formation of nitrosamine in the stomach, but only when the fat content of a meal is less than 10%, beyond which they instead increase the formation of nitrosamine.

=== Antidote for cyanide poisoning===
Nitrites in the form of sodium nitrite and amyl nitrite are components of many cyanide antidote kits. Both of these compounds bind to hemoglobin and oxidize the Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions forming methemoglobin. Methemoglobin, in turn, binds to cyanide (CN), creating cyanmethemoglobin, effectively removing cyanide from the complex IV of the electron transport chain (ETC) in mitochondria, which is the primary site of disruption caused by cyanide. Another mechanism by which nitrites help treat cyanide toxicity is the generation of nitric oxide (NO). NO displaces the CN from the cytochrome c oxidase (ETC complex IV), making it available for methemoglobin to bind.

==Organic nitrites==
In organic chemistry, alkyl nitrites are esters of nitrous acid and contain the nitrosoxy functional group. Nitro compounds contain the C–NO2 group. Nitrites have the general formula RONO, where R is an aryl or alkyl group. Amyl nitrite and other alkyl nitrites have a vasodilating action and must be handled in the laboratory with caution. They are sometimes used in medicine for the treatment of heart diseases. A classic named reaction for the synthesis of alkyl nitrites is the Meyer synthesis in which alkyl halides react with metallic nitrites to a mixture to nitroalkanes and nitrites.

==Safety==
Nitrite salts can react with secondary amines to produce &quot;N&quot;-nitrosamines, which are suspected of causing stomach cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) advises that each of processed meat eaten a day would raise the risk of getting bowel cancer by 18% over a lifetime; processed meat refers to meat that has been transformed through fermentation, nitrite curing, salting, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavor or improve preservation. The World Health Organization&#x27;s review of more than 400 studies concluded in 2015 that there was sufficient evidence that processed meats caused cancer, particularly colon cancer; the WHO&#x27;s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified processed meats as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).

Nitrite (ingested) under conditions that result in endogenous nitrosation, specifically the production of nitrosamine, has been classified as &quot;Probably carcinogenic to humans&quot; (Group 2A) by the IARC.

<doc id="379318" wikidata="Q4410082" url="?curid=379318" title="Holy Cross Sermons">
<text>The Holy Cross Sermons () are the oldest extant prose text in the Polish language, dating probably from the late 13th or early 14th century. The documents are named after the place where they were originally housed – the Holy Cross Monastery (pl) in Poland&#x27;s Holy Cross Mountains (Polish: &quot;Góry Świętokrzyskie&quot;). They were discovered in 1890 by Aleksander Brückner, in the form of parchment pieces cut into reinforcing strips, inside the binding of a Latin language codex, which contained the Acts of the Apostles and the Apocalypse. The sermons were first published in 1891, in a &quot;Philological Works&quot; (&quot;Prace Filologiczne&quot;) magazine. In 1934, facsimiles of the text were published by the Polish Academy of Learning, and in 2009, new, full edition of the sermons was issued, prepared by professor Paweł Stępień.

== History ==
Even though Aleksander Brückner claimed that the text was originally housed at the Holy Cross Monastery, this hypothesis has been criticized by some scholars. According to historian Władysław Semkowicz, the codex, already strengthened with strips of parchment, was delivered to a Benedictine monastery at Leżajsk, around 1459.

The Leżajsk monastery, however, was not the location where the sermons were written. Language analysis carried out by Polish experts proved that the text was probably written in a monastery in Miechów, which was famous for its sermons and library, and which cooperated with the Leżajsk monastery. On the other hand, if sermons were written in the 13th century, then their Miechów origins are dubious. At that time, the monks of this monastery were of Czech and German origin, who either did not speak Polish, or spoke it poorly and were unable to write down the complicated text.

Some time in the 15th century, the sermons were cut into strips, which were used to strengthen the binding of a Latin language codex. Most likely, other parts of the sermons were used in bindings of other books. This practice was common at the time, as parchment was both durable and expensive, so publications regarded as unnecessary or unimportant were frequently used to strengthen other, more precious books.

Aleksander Brückner discovered the sermons on March 25, 1890, at the Imperial Public Library in St. Petersburg, Russian Empire. He was studying an ancient Latin codex, which had belonged to the Warsaw University library, and was confiscated by the Russians after the November Uprising (1831). In the binding of the book, Brückner to his surprise found eighteen long strips. After putting them together, it turned out that they contained one whole, and five incomplete sermons.

They were brought back to Poland in 1925. During World War II, the Holy Cross Sermons were taken to Canada for safekeeping. They are now preserved at the National Library in Warsaw (#8001), and their photocopy may be seen at The Digital National Library Polona (See electronic version of the Holy Cross Sermons). From May 2024, the manuscript is presented at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth.

== Description ==
The sermons, on the occasions of Church holy days, comprise fragments of five texts and one complete sermon (for St. Catherine&#x27;s Day). Written on parchment, they had been cut into thin strips and used to reinforce the binding of a 15th-century Latin manuscript. The fifteen strips, put together by Bruckner, make one sheet (117 × 173 mm), and the remaining three strips make the bottom of a second sheet.

Linguistically, the Holy Cross Sermons reflect an older stage of the language than the 14th century, the manuscript being a copy of original sermons composed some time from the end of the 13th century. They manifest a variety of linguistic archaisms, for instance:

1) Hard-stem declension of the pronoun &quot;*tъnъ&quot; &#x27;this one&#x27;: Nom. sg. &quot;ten&quot;, Gen. sg. &quot;togo&quot;, Dat. sg. &quot;tomu&quot;;

2) Aorist and Imperfect:

- 1 sg. aor. &quot;widziech&quot; (cf. Lat. perf. &quot;vidi&quot;) &lt; PSl. &quot;*viděti&quot; &#x27;to see, to look&#x27;, &quot;*viděxъ&quot; &#x27;I saw, I looked (at); I have seen, I have looked (at)&#x27;;

- 3 sg. aor. &quot;postawi&quot; (cf. Lat. perf. &quot;posuit&quot;) &lt; PSl. &quot;*postaviti&quot; &#x27;to place&#x27;, &quot;*postavi&quot; &#x27;he/she/it placed, has placed&#x27;;

- 3 pl. aor. &quot;pośpieszychą się&quot; (cf. Lat. perf. &quot;venerunt&quot;) &lt; PSl. &quot;*pospěšiti&quot; &#x27;to go, to go somewhere&#x27;, &quot;*pospěšixǫ&quot; &#x27;they went, they went somewhere, they went out&#x27;;

- 3 sg. impf. &quot;biesze&quot; (cf. Lat. impf. &quot;erat&quot;) &lt; PSl. &quot;*byti&quot; &#x27;to be&#x27;, &quot;*běaše&quot; &#x27;he/she/it was&#x27;;

- 3 sg. impf. &quot;siedziesze&quot; (cf. Lat. impf. &quot;sedebat&quot;) &lt; PSl. &quot;*sěděti&quot; &#x27;to sit&#x27;, &quot;*sěděaše&quot; &#x27;he/she/it sat, was sitting&#x27;.

== Contents ==
The strips contain a whole sermon for St. Catherine&#x27;s Day (November 25), and parts of sermons for the following days:
* Michaelmas (September 29),
* Saint Nicholas Day (December 6),
* Christmas (December 24),
* Epiphany (called in Poland Three Kings’ Day, January 6),
* Feast of the Purification of the Virgin (February 2).

<text>Muhal Richard Abrams (born Richard Lewis Abrams; September 19, 1930 – October 29, 2017) was an American educator, administrator, composer, arranger, clarinetist, cellist, and jazz pianist in the free jazz medium. He recorded and toured the United States, Canada and Europe with his orchestra, sextet, quartet, duo, and as a solo pianist.

==Early life==
Abrams&#x27;s mother, Edna, was born in Memphis. His father, Milton, was born in Alabama and moved with his parents to Chicago. Richard Lewis Abrams was born there, the second of nine children, on September 19, 1930. His father became a self-employed handyman; his mother was a housewife.

&quot;Abrams&#x27;s paternal grandfather was &#x27;what you call a junk man&#x27;, selling the fruits of neighborhood foraging. Abrams and his brother would pull the cart around the neighborhood, eventually arriving at a junk-yard on State Street, where the items would be sold.&quot; Abrams first attended Forrestville public school in Chicago. He grew up in a gang area; truancy and fighting meant that he was sent to Moseley School, a reformatory school for boys. There, in addition to strict discipline, he was taught about black histories. He later moved on to DuSable High School.

Although he was aware of the strong music program there, led by Walter Dyett, Abrams preferred playing sports, so did not participate in Dyett&#x27;s classes. Among the future musicians Abrams met at the school were Charles Davis, Richard Davis, John Gilmore, Johnny Griffin, Laurdine Patrick, and Julian Priester.

As a child, Abrams was interested in the arts – film, painting, sculpture, and music. He later recounted that, in 1946, he decided to concentrate on the last of these, so left school and started piano lessons with a classically trained church pianist. He went on to study at the Metropolitan School of Music, which merged with Roosevelt University. &quot;Supporting his studies in counterpoint, keyboard harmony, theory, and composition with a day job at a downtown printing company, Abrams eventually bought a second-hand piano.&quot; He also dropped out of his music school, reporting of his studies: &quot;I didn&#x27;t get too much out of that, because it wasn&#x27;t what I was hearing in the street&quot;. He then decided to study independently: &quot;I&#x27;ve always had a natural ability to study and analyze things. I used that ability, not even knowing what it was (it was just a feeling) and started to read books.&quot; In Abrams&#x27; words: From there, I acquired a small spinet piano and started to teach myself how to play the instrument and read the notes – or, first of all, what key the music was in. It took time and a lot of sweat. But I analyzed it and before long I was playing with the musicians on the scene. I listened to Art Tatum, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell and many others and concentrated on Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson for composition. Later I got scores and studied more extensive things that take place in classical composition and started to practice classical pieces on the piano.

==Later life and career==

===1950s and 1960s===
Abrams started out &quot;playing all kinds of gigs - blues, jazz, stage shows, rhythm and blues, and church socials.&quot; His musical abilities earned him jobs working with &quot;everyone from Dexter Gordon and Max Roach to Ruth Brown and Woody Shaw.&quot;

In the mid-1950s, Abrams was becoming better known as both a pianist and a composer. A strong influence on his direction as a pianist at that time was King Fleming, for whom Abrams also composed and arranged. Another local man, William E. Jackson, helped Abrams develop his arranging and orchestration skills. Abrams co-founded a quintet named the MJT+3, and recorded with them in 1957, resulting in &quot;Daddy-O Presents MJT+3&quot;, which contained several of his compositions. Abrams also became more involved in investigating the &quot;occult arts&quot; around 1959 or 1960, and joined the Rosicrucians.

Abrams&#x27;s son, Richard Jr., was at high school in the early 1960s.

Still eager for self-development, Abrams was introduced to, and then acquired, books on musical composition written by Joseph Schillinger. In the books, Abrams found topics that resonated, including the incorporation of spirituality into music. At a more practical level, the pianist reported that &quot;The Schillinger stuff taught me to break things back down into raw material – where it came from – and then, on to the whole idea of a personal or individual approach to composition.&quot;

Abrams was able to apply his learning after organising young musicians in the area into an ensemble that rehearsed at the C&amp;C Lounge in Chicago from 1961. This became known as the Experimental Band, and &quot;became a forum for Abrams to test his new, Schillinger-influenced compositional palette.&quot;

Around 1963, Abrams was part of a trio with bassist Donald Rafael Garrett and drummer Steve McCall. The pianist lived with his wife, Peggy, in a small basement apartment on South Evans Avenue. It was the location for nightly gatherings of musicians from the area, who &quot;would explore musical, cultural, political, social, and spiritual ideas.&quot; Abrams found that he was in, and wanted to be in, the position that Fleming and Jackson had been with him – helping younger and less experienced musicians to develop. The Experimental Band, led by Abrams, encouraged cooperation, knowledge exchange, and the playing of its members&#x27; compositions. In interviews in later years, Abrams tended to downplay his influence on other, younger musicians. They, however, remembered things differently: &quot;Everybody was following him around like little puppies&quot;, said saxophonist Gene Dinwiddie, while Roscoe Mitchell summarized that &quot;He would always be turning people on to books, and talking about scores. Maybe he just doesn&#x27;t realize the effect that he had on people&#x27;s lives.&quot;

The Experimental Band had very few, if any, public performances. Although some rehearsal tapes were made, these were for study purposes and were routinely recorded over.

In 1965, four men – Abrams, pianist Jodie Christian, composer Phil Cohran, and drummer Steve McCall – agreed to form a new organization of musicians. They invited mostly other African Americans to the first meeting, on May 8, at which they discussed the principles of the nascent organization, the primary one being that it would be for original, creative music. At the second meeting, Abrams was elected president. Later in the month, an official name was chosen – the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). When the AACM started a school in 1967, Abrams led the classes in composition.

Further exposure with the AACM helped Abrams get a recording contract with Delmark Records. His first album for them, &quot;Levels and Degrees of Light&quot;, was recorded in 1967, and featured the recording debuts of saxophonist Anthony Braxton, violinist Leroy Jenkins, and bassist Leonard Jones.

Rather than playing in smoky night clubs, AACM members often rented out theaters and lofts where they could perform for attentive and open-minded audiences.

&quot;Abrams took the name Muhal in 1967. Interviewed by the French magazine &quot;Jazz&quot; in 1973, he said that the word, its origin unclear, means &#x27;number one&#x27;.&quot;

Abrams also played with saxophonists Eddie Harris, Gordon, and other more bop-oriented musicians during this era.

===1970s and 1980s, Loft jazz era===

In the 1970s, Abrams composed for symphony orchestras, string quartets, solo piano, voice, and big bands in addition to making a series of larger ensemble recordings that included harp and accordion. In the early 1970s, his big band had a weekly concert at the Transitions East performance space in Chicago. Abrams formed a sextet from other AACM members in 1972. The other musicians were Reggie Willis on bass, Steve McCall on drums, and Kalaparusha Difda, Wallace McMillan, and Henry Threadgill on various woodwind and saxophone instruments. With this band, Abrams had his first international concerts, playing the Berlin Jazz Festival in 1973. He had a successful solo concert at the Montreaux Jazz Festival the following year, as well as touring Europe with the Art Ensemble of Chicago.

During this time, Abrams recorded extensively under his own name (frequently on the Black Saint label), and as a sideman for musicians such as Marion Brown (&quot;Sweet Earth Flying&quot;, 1974), Anthony Braxton (&quot;Duets 1976&quot;, 1976), Roscoe Mitchell (&quot;Roscoe Mitchell Quartet&quot;, 1976), and Chico Freeman (&quot;Morning Prayer&quot;, 1976, and &quot;Chico&quot;, 1977). He served as composer and wrote the theme for the 1970 drama series &quot;Bird of the Iron Feather&quot;, the first all-Black television soap opera started by Richard Durham.

Abrams left Chicago for New York in 1976. After initially living with other musicians, he moved his family there the following year. The move of city was partly to be at the centre of musical activity, and partly for financial reasons. Initially, there were very few concerts, but he garnered press attention and was able to record annually with Black Saint. Experience in writing extended compositions also helped Abrams and other AACM musicians in New York: &quot;The compositions themselves showed that they were outside of the mainstream of jazz, and notice was taken by classical people. You can get access to these [classical music] ensembles, and it started to happen.&quot;

In the late 1970s, Abrams was also part of the jazz peer-review panels for the National Endowment for the Arts. &quot;As a Chicagoan who was identified with experimental music, yet who was respected by the ancien regime, Abrams was uniquely positioned to take a leading role in guiding the broad changes in both the demographics and the aesthetic directions of the panels that gradually took place.&quot;

His &quot;1-OQA+19&quot; &quot;juxtaposed complex written passages with propulsive rhythms&quot;; and &quot;Lifea Blinec&quot; &quot;presented multi-instrumentalism, text-sound, and electronic textures.&quot;

He was involved in the local Loft Jazz scene in New York. In 1982, he presented an orchestral work at that year&#x27;s New Music America festival in Chicago. He also helped set up the New York Chapter of the AACM, which first presented concerts in the city in 1982.

===1990–2017===
In 1990 Abrams won the Jazzpar Prize, an annual Danish prize within jazz. Abrams received a 1997 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. In 2005, the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the AACM, some of Abrams&#x27;s solo and ensemble pieces were presented by the organization in New York. In May 2009 the National Endowment for the Arts announced that Abrams would be one of the recipients of the 2010 NEA Jazz Masters Award. In June 2010, Abrams was given the Lifetime Achievement Award by New York City&#x27;s premier jazz festival, known as the Vision Festival. Abrams died at his home in Manhattan, at the age of 87. His daughter, Richarda, became an actress and singer.

==Influence==
He is a widely influential artist, having played sides for many musicians early in his career, releasing important recordings as a leader, and writing classical works such as his &quot;String Quartet No. 2&quot;, which was performed by the Kronos Quartet, on November 22, 1985, at the Carnegie Recital Hall in New York.

<doc id="379330" wikidata="Q385642" url="?curid=379330" title="Fighter-bomber">
<text>A fighter-bomber is a fighter aircraft that has been modified, or used primarily, as a light bomber or attack aircraft. It differs from bomber and attack aircraft primarily in its origins, as a fighter that has been adapted into other roles, whereas bombers and attack aircraft are developed specifically for bombing and attack roles.

Although still used, the term fighter-bomber has less significance since the introduction of rockets and guided missiles into aerial warfare. Modern aircraft with similar duties are now typically called multirole combat aircraft or strike fighters.

==Development==
Prior to World War II, general limitations in available engine and aeronautical technology required that each proposed military aircraft have its design tailored to a specific prescribed role. Engine power grew dramatically during the early period of the war, roughly doubling between 1939 and 1943. The Bristol Blenheim, a typical light bomber of the opening stages of the war, was originally designed in 1934 as a fast civil transport to meet a challenge by Lord Rothermere, owner of the Daily Mail. It had two Bristol Mercury XV radial engines of each, a crew of three, and its payload was just of bombs. The Blenheim suffered disastrous losses over France in 1939 when it encountered Messerschmitt Bf 109s, and light bombers were quickly withdrawn.

In contrast, the Vought F4U Corsair fighter—which entered service in December 1942—had in common with its eventual U.S. Navy stablemate, the Grumman F6F Hellcat and the massive, seven-ton USAAF Republic P-47 Thunderbolt—a single Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial engine of in a much smaller, simpler and less expensive single-seat aircraft, and was the first aircraft design to ever fly with the Double Wasp engine in May 1940. With less airframe and crew to lift, the Corsair&#x27;s ordnance load was either four High Velocity Aircraft Rockets or of bombs; a later version could carry eight rockets or of bombs. The massive, powerful 18-cylinder Double Wasp engine weighed almost a ton—half as much again as the V12 Rolls-Royce Merlin and twice as much as the 9-cylinder Bristol Mercury that powered some heavy fighters.

Increased engine power meant that many existing fighter designs could carry useful bomb loads, and adapt to the fighter-bomber role. Notable examples include the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, Hawker Typhoon and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Various bombing tactics and techniques could also be used: some designs were intended for high-level bombing, others for the low-level semi-horizontal bombing, or even for low-level steep dive bombing as exemplified by the Blackburn Skua and North American A-36 Apache.

Larger twin-engined aircraft were also used in the fighter-bomber role, especially where longer ranges were needed for naval strikes. Examples include the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, the Bristol Beaufighter (developed from a torpedo bomber), and de Havilland Mosquito (developed from an unarmed fast bomber). The Beaufighter MkV had a Boulton-Paul turret with four 0.303 in (7.7 mm) machine guns mounted aft of the cockpit but only two were built. Bristol&#x27;s Blenheim was even pushed into service as a fighter during the Battle of Britain but it was not fast enough. Equipped with an early Airborne Interception (AI) radar set, however, it proved to be an effective night fighter.

==First World War==
The first single-seat fighters to drop bombs were on the Western Front, when fighter patrols were issued with bombs and ordered to drop them at random if they met no German fighters. The Sopwith Camel, the most successful Allied aircraft of the First World War with 1,294 enemy aircraft downed, was losing its edge by 1918, especially over . During the final German offensive in March 1918, it dropped Cooper bombs on advancing columns: whilst puny by later standards, the four fragmentation bombs carried by a Camel could cause serious injuries to exposed troops. Pilot casualties were also high. The Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5. was used in the same role.

The Royal Flying Corps received the first purpose-built fighter-bomber just as the war was ending. It was not called a fighter bomber at the time, but a Trench Fighter as that was what it was designed to attack. The Sopwith Salamander was based on the Sopwith Snipe fighter but had armour plating in the nose to protect the pilot and fuel system from ground fire. Originally it was intended to have two machine guns jutting through the cockpit floor so as to spray trenches with bullets as it passed low overhead. But this did not work and it was fitted with four Cooper bombs, instead. It was ordered in very large numbers, but most were canceled after the Armistice.

In February and April 1918 the Royal Flying Corps conducted bombing tests at Orfordness, Suffolk dropping dummy bombs at various dive angles at a flag stuck into a shingle beach. Both WW1 fighter bombers were used with novice and experienced pilots. The best results were achieved with a vertical dive into the wind using the Aldis Sight to align the aircraft. But they were not considered good enough to justify the expected casualty rate.

==Second World War==

When war broke out in Europe, Western Allied Air Forces employed light twin-engined bombers in the tactical role for low-level attacks. These were found to be extremely vulnerable both to ground fire and to single-engine fighters. The German and Japanese Air Forces had chosen dive bombers which were similarly vulnerable. The Ilyushin Il-2 is a heavily armoured two-seat single-engine ground-attack aircraft. It first flew a month later although few had reached the Soviet Air Force in time for Operation Barbarossa. Naval forces chose both torpedo and dive bombers. None of these could be considered as fighter bombers as they could not combat fighters.

=== Germany ===

During the Battle of Britain, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; conducted fighter-bomber attacks on the United Kingdom from September to December 1940. A larger fighter-bomber campaign was conducted against the UK from March 1942 until June 1943. These operations were successful in tying down Allied resources at a relatively low cost to the Luftwaffe, but the British Government regarded the campaign as a nuisance given the small scale of the individual raids.

In August 1941, RAF pilots reported encountering a very fast radial engine fighter over France. First thought to be captured French Curtiss 75 Mohawks, they turned out to be Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, slightly faster and more heavily armed than the current Spitfire V. Kurt Tank had designed the aircraft when the Spitfire and Bf 109 were the fastest fighters flying; he called them racehorses, fast but fragile. As a former World War I cavalryman, Tank chose to design a warhorse. With a BMW 801 radial engine, wide-set undercarriage, and two 20mm cannons as well as machine guns it became a better fighter-bomber than either of the pure fighters.

By mid-1942, the first of these &quot;Jagdbombers&quot; (literally &quot;fighter&quot; or &quot;hunter&quot; bomber, known for short as &quot;Jabos&quot;) was operating over Kent. On October 31, 60 Fw 190s bombed Canterbury with only one aircraft lost, killing 32 civilians and injuring 116, in the largest raid since the Blitz. Flying at sea level, under the radar, these raids were hard to intercept. The Jabos reached the Eastern Front in time to bomb Russian positions in Stalingrad. By July 1943 Fw 190s were replacing the vulnerable Stukas over the Battle of Kursk: although winning the air war, they were unable to prevent subsequent Red Army advances.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1945 in Operation Bodenplatte, over 1,000 aircraft (including more than 600 Fw 190s) launched a last-ditch attempt to destroy Allied planes on the ground in support of the Battle of the Bulge. Allied fighter aircraft and fighter-bomber losses were downplayed, at the time. Seventeen airfields were targeted, of which seven lost many aircraft. The surprise was complete as the few Ultra intercepts had not been understood. At the worst hit, the Canadian base at Eindhoven, 26 Typhoons and 6 Spitfires were destroyed and another 30 Typhoons damaged. In total, 305 aircraft, mostly fighters, and fighter-bombers were destroyed and another 190 damaged. The Luftwaffe lost 143 pilots killed, 71 captured and 20 wounded, making the worst one-day loss in its history; it never recovered.

=== United Kingdom ===

The Bristol Blenheim and Douglas A-20 Havoc (which the RAF called Boston) were used as night fighters during the Blitz, as they could carry the heavy early airborne radars.

The Hawker Henley, a two-seat version of the Battle of Britain-winning Hawker Hurricane, was designed as a dive bomber. It might have proved to be a capable fighter-bomber but overheating of its Rolls-Royce Merlin engine in this installation led to its relegation to a target tug role, where it could match the speed of the German bombers whilst towing a drone.

In 1934, the British Air Ministry called for a carrier aircraft that could combine the roles of the dive bomber and fighter, to save limited space on small carriers. The Blackburn Skua was not expected to encounter land-based fighters but was to intercept long-range bombers attacking the fleet and also to sink ships. As a two-seater, it could not fight the Messerschmitt Bf 109 on equal terms. But the second seat carried a radio operator with a homing device that could find the carrier even when it had moved, in foul North Sea weather. It achieved one of the first kills of the war, when three from HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; downed a German Dornier Do 18 flying boat over the North Sea.

On April 10, 1940, 16 Skuas operating from RNAS Hatston in Orkney under Commander William Lucy sank the German cruiser &quot;Königsberg&quot; which was tied to a mole in Bergen harbour. The Germans recorded five hits or near misses and as the ship started to sink, electric power failed, dooming the ship. The German cruiser &quot;Köln&quot; had departed during the night.

With the failing of the Hawker Henley and the gradual fading of the Hawker Hurricane&#x27;s performance compared to the latest German fighters, it was modified to carry four 20mm cannon and two bombs; once bombs were jettisoned the aircraft could put up a reasonable fight. Inevitably the type became known in the RAF as the “Hurribomber”, reaching squadrons in June 1941.

It was soon found that it was hardly possible to hit fast-moving Panzers in the Western Desert, with bombs and cannon fire-making little impact on their armour. Daylight bombing raids were made on the French and Belgian coasts, targeting mostly oil and gas works. Losses were heavy, often more than the numbers of enemy fighters destroyed. By May 1942 Hurricane IICs with drop tanks were intruding at night over France. On the night of May 4–5, Czech pilot Karel Kuttelwascher flying from RAF Tangmere with No 1 Squadron shot down three Dornier Do 17s as they slowed to land at Saint-André-de-Bohon after raiding England.

On September 25, 1942, the Gestapo HQ in Oslo was attacked by four de Havilland Mosquitoes, which had flown over the North Sea below by dead reckoning navigation from RAF Leuchars, Scotland, carrying four bombs each. The next day the RAF unveiled its new fast bomber. On December 31, 1944, the same aircraft was used against the same target, this time from RAF Peterhead in Scotland, flying high and diving onto the building. In February 1941 the Mosquito with two Rolls-Royce Merlin engines and a streamlined wooden fuselage achieved , faster than the current Spitfire. It was used on all kinds of missions, including silencing Hermann Göring&#x27;s Berlin Nazi anniversary broadcast on January 20, 1943, leading him to tell Erhard Milch, Air Inspector General that “when I see the Mosquito I am yellow and green with envy. (The British) have the geniuses and we have the nincompoops.”

Initially used for high-level photo-reconnaissance, the Mosquito was adapted to precision bombing, night fighter, and fighter bomber roles. It was built in Canada and Australia as well as the UK. Fitted with a British Army Ordnance QF 6 pounder (57 mm) gun it could sink U-boats found on the surface. On April 9, 1945, three were sunk en route to Norway, and in the following month, Mosquitos sank two more.

The Hawker Typhoon was being designed as a replacement for the Hurricane in March 1937 before production had even started. The reason was to take advantage of the new engines then being planned, either the Napier Sabre or Rolls-Royce Vulture which required a larger airframe than the nimble Hurricane. At the prototype stage, there were problems with the new engines and stability of the aircraft itself, which led the Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook to decree that production must focus on Spitfires and Hurricanes.

The Typhoon disappointed as a fighter, especially at altitude but found its true niche as a fighter bomber from September 1942. It was fitted with racks to carry two and then two bombs. By September 1943 it was fitted with eight RP-3 rockets each with a warhead, equivalent to the power of a naval destroyer&#x27;s broadside.

Claims of German tanks destroyed by rocket-armed Typhoons in Normandy after D-Day were exaggerated. In Operation Goodwood, the attempt by British and Canadian forces to surround Caen of 75 tanks recorded as lost by the Germans, only 10 were found to be due to rocket-firing Typhoons.

At Mortain, where the German counter-offensive Operation Lüttich came within of cutting through US forces to Avranches, Typhoons destroyed 9 of 46 tanks lost but were more effective against unarmoured vehicles and troops and cause the armoured vehicles to seek cover. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, said &quot;The chief credit in smashing the enemy&#x27;s spearhead, however, must go to the rocket-firing Typhoon aircraft of the Second Tactical Air Force. The result of the strafing was that the enemy attack was effectively brought to a halt, and a threat was turned into a great victory&quot;.

The disparity between claims and actual destruction at about 25-1 owed much to the difficulty of hitting a fast-moving tank with an unguided rocket, even from a stable aircraft like the Typhoon. But soft targets were simpler. When the 51st Highland Division moved to block German panzers reaching Antwerp in the Battle of the Bulge Tommy Macpherson saw a half-track full of SS soldiers. All were uninjured, powerful men over tall. All were dead, killed by the air blast from a Typhoon rocket.

The Bristol Beaufighter was a long-range twin-engine heavy fighter derived from the Bristol Beaufort torpedo bomber but with the Bristol Hercules radial engine to give it a top speed faster. By late 1942 the Beaufighter was also capable of carrying torpedoes or rockets. The main user was RAF Coastal Command although it was also used in the Royal Australian Air Force with some aircraft assembled in Australia and by the USAAF.

Over 30 Beaufighters flying from RAF Dallachy in Scotland from Australian, British, Canadian, and New Zealand squadrons attacked the German destroyer Z33 sheltering in Førde Fjord Norway. They were escorted by only 10 to 12 North American P-51 Mustangs. German destroyers escorted convoys of Swedish iron ore, which in winter were forced to creep along the Atlantic Coast by night, hiding deep inside fjords by day. Z33 was moored close to the vertical cliffside of the fjords so Beaufighters had to attack singly with rockets without the normal tactic of having simultaneous attacks by other Beaufighters firing cannon at the numerous flak gunners. Twelve Focke-Wulf Fw 190s surprised the Mustangs and Norway&#x27;s biggest ever air battle was soon raging. Nine Beaufighters and one Mustang were lost as were five Fw 190s. The destroyer was damaged and February 9, 1945, became known as Black Friday.

Typhoons were involved in one of the worst tragedies at the end of the war when four squadrons attacked the luxury liners SS &quot;Deutschland&quot; and the SS &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; and two smaller ships SS &quot;Athen&quot; and SS &quot;Thielbek&quot; moored off Neustadt in Lübeck Bay The &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; had 4,500 concentration camp inmates and the &quot;Thielbek&quot; another 2,800 as well as SS Guards. The &quot;Deutschland&quot; had a Red Cross flag painted on at least one funnel. The previous day the Captain of the &quot;Cap Arcona&quot; refused to take any more inmates on board. On return to shore in longboats they were gunned down by Hitler Jugend, SS Guards and German Marines. Of an estimated 14,500 victims in the area two days earlier only 1,450 survived.

The Hawker Tempest was a development of the Typhoon using the thin wing with an aerofoil developed by NACA and a more powerful version of the Napier Sabre engine, giving a top speed of . At a low level, it was faster than any other Allied or German aircraft, but slower than the Spitfire above . Fitted with four 20mm cannon it was a formidable fighter, respected even by Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter pilots as their most dangerous opponent. At its debut over the Normandy Beaches on D-Day +2, Tempests shot down three German fighters, without loss. Tempests supported the ambitious attempt to capture the bridge at Arnhem in Operation Market Garden in mid-September 1944. David C. Fairbanks, an American who joined the Royal Canadian Air Force was the top Tempest ace with 12 victories including an Arado Ar 234 jet bomber.

=== United States ===
General Henry H. Arnold, Chief of the United States Army Air Forces, urged the adoption of the Mosquito by the U.S. but was overruled by those who felt that the as yet untried Lockheed P-38 Lightning also twin-engined, could fulfill the same role. Although Lightning got its name from the RAF, the British eventually rejected it. Too slow and cumbersome to match Bf 109s as an escort fighter over Germany, it did fly over Normandy as a fighter bomber, where one tried skip-bombing a bomb through the door of Field Marshal Günther von Kluge&#x27;s OB West HQ. A Lightning squadron also killed Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto over Bougainville in the Pacific acting on an Ultra intercept.

The Republic P-47 Thunderbolt was a larger, evolutionary development of the P-43/P-44 fighter undertaken after the United States Army Air Forces observed Messerschmitt Bf 109s performing in the Battle of Britain. It was a massive aircraft built around the powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp engine and weighed up to eight tons with ordnance. The P-47 was twice as heavy and had four times the fuselage size of a Spitfire. Armed with eight .50 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns it could outshoot any enemy fighter, and as a fighter-bomber, it could carry half the bomb load of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress or 10 five-inch (127 mm) High Velocity Aircraft Rockets.

The first pilots to fly the Thunderbolt from England were Americans who had been flying Spitfires in the RAF before the U.S. joined the war. They were not impressed initially; the Thunderbolt lost out to the more nimble Spitfire so consistently in mock dogfights that these encounters were eventually banned. But by November 25, 1943 Thunderbolts had found their true niche, attacking a Luftwaffe airfield at Saint-Omer near Calais, France. On October 13, 1944, a Thunderbolt from 9th Air Force damaged the German Torpedoboot Ausland &quot;38&quot; (formerly the Italian 750 ton torpedo boat &quot;Spada)&quot; so badly near Trieste with gunfire alone that the ship was scuttled.

The Vought F4U Corsair was built around the same Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp engine as the Thunderbolt, but for the U.S. Navy. Difficulties with carrier landings meant that the first aircraft were used by the United States Marine Corps from Henderson Field, Guadalcanal from February 12, 1943. In its first combat action, the following day over Kahili airfield two Corsairs and eight other aircraft were lost when attacked by 50 Mitsubishi A6M Zeros. This became known as the St Valentine&#x27;s Day massacre. Despite this initiation the Corsair soon proved to be an effective fighter bomber, mostly flown by the Marine Corps, but also by the United States Navy, Fleet Air Arm and Royal New Zealand Air Force in the Pacific theater.

When the British Purchasing Commission invited James H. Kindelberger, President of North American Aviation, to assemble the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk in an underutilized plant, he promised a better fighter on the same timing. The resulting North American P-51 Mustang powered by a Packard-built Rolls-Royce Merlin engine became the outstanding long-range fighter of the war. When Lend-lease funding for the RAF Mustangs was exhausted, Kindleberger tried to interest the USAAC but no funds were available for a fighter; instead, the Mustang was fitted with dive brakes and emerged as the North American A-36 Apache, a dive bomber almost as fast as the Mustang itself. By April 1943 USAAF Apaches were in Morocco supporting Operation Torch, and they continued bombing trains and gun emplacements northwards through Italy.

==Korean War==
When Soviet-backed North Korea attacked South Korea on June 25, 1950, their forces quickly routed the South Korean army which lacked tanks, anti-tank and heavy artillery. Its Air Force had 22 planes, none of which were fighters, or jets. During a Soviet boycott of the United Nations, a vote was carried without Soviet veto, to intervene in support of the South. Most readily available were U.S. and British Commonwealth forces occupying Japan and the Pacific fleets. The first arrivals were fighter-bombers, which helped to repulse the Northern attack on the vital port of Pusan, the last small territory held by the South. Some strategists felt that air and battleship strikes alone could halt the invasion.

USAF North American F-82 Twin Mustangs had the range to reach the front line from Japanese bases. The last piston-engined aircraft, produced in the U.S., it looked like two Mustangs, with two pilots in separate fuselages, bolted together. Initially intended to escort bombers over Japan from remote Pacific island bases, hence its long-range, it missed WWII and first saw action in Korea. Plain North American P-51 Mustangs of the Royal Australian Air Force soon also flew across from Japan.

Vought F4U Corsairs and Hawker Sea Furys from U.S., British and Australian carriers in the Yellow Sea and later from Korean airfields, also attacked the Pusan perimeter. The Sea Fury, a development of the Hawker Tempest had a Bristol Centaurus engine of giving a top speed, one of the fastest piston-engined aircraft ever built. Initially, United Nations air forces using piston-engined fighter-bombers and straight wing jet fighters easily drove the North Koreans out of the sky and so disrupted logistics and hence the attack on Pusan.

All changed when the Soviet Air Force intervened with swept-wing Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s flown by Russian pilots on November 1. The planes had Korean markings and the pilots had been taught a few Korean words, in a thin sham that the USSR was not fighting. The MiG-15 used captured German swept wing technology and tools and British jet engines, 25 of which had been a gift from Stafford Cripps the president of the Board of Trade and were quickly copied. Josef Stalin remarked “What fool will sell us his secrets?” The MiG&#x27;s Rolls-Royce Nene had thrust, twice as much as the jets of its main British and US opponents, which used the older Rolls-Royce Derwent design. Only the Navy Grumman F9F Panther used a version of the Nene and could match the MiG-15, accounting for seven during November.

Daylight heavy bomber raids over North Korea ceased and the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star and its all-weather variant the Lockheed F-94 Starfire were focused on bombing missions whilst the North American F-86 Sabre was rushed to Korea to combat the MiG-15s. There is much debate as to which was the better fighter. Recent research suggests a 13-10 advantage to the Sabre against Russian pilots, but the US pilots were mostly WWII veterans whilst the Russians were often “volunteers” with only a few hours aloft. The Australians converted from Mustangs to Gloster Meteor fighter-bombers, the first Allied jet fighter of WWII but no match for a MiG-15. It was pressed into combat but after four were lost when the squadron was bounced by 40 Mig-15s, reverted to ground attack, carrying 16 rockets. Although Meteors shot down 6 MiG-15s, 30 were lost, but mainly to ground fire. Both Corsairs and Sea Furies also shot down MiG-15s, but were vulnerable to the faster jet.
==Post-war==

Fighter-bombers became increasingly important in the 1950s and 1960s, as new jet engines dramatically improved the power of even the smallest fighter designs. Many aircraft initially designed as fighters or interceptors found themselves in the fighter-bomber role at some point in their career. Notable among these is the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, first designed as a high-performance day fighter and then adapted to the nuclear strike role for European use. Other U.S. examples include the North American F-100 Super Sabre and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, each of which was widely used during the Vietnam War. An example of a modern purpose-designed fighter bomber is the Sukhoi Su-34.

<text>This article presents a list of cities and towns in Bangladesh. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operatives of Bangladesh, there are 532 urban centres in Bangladesh.


The bureau defines an urban centre with a population of 100,000 or more as a &quot;city&quot;. Altogether, there are 43 such cities in Bangladesh. 11 of these cities can be considered major cities as these are governed by City Corporations. All of the City Corporation-governed cities currently have a population of more than 200,000, which is not a criterion for the status, because currently 17 cities in Bangladesh have a population of more than 200,000. Besides the 9 major cities, there are 32 other cities in Bangladesh that are not governed by &quot;City Corporations&quot;, rather by &quot;Municipal Corporations&quot;. A city with a population of more than 10,000,000 is defined by the bureau as a megacity. Dhaka is the only megacity in Bangladesh according to this definition. Together, Dhaka and the port city of Chittagong account for 48% of the country&#x27;s urban population.

An urban centre with a population of less than 100,000 is defined as a &quot;town&quot;. In total, there are 490 such towns in Bangladesh. Among these, 287 towns are governed by &quot;Municipal Corporations&quot;. These are called &quot;Paurashava&quot;s in the local Bengali language. Altogether, including the ones governing the 32 other non-major cities, there are 318 Municipal Corporations.

In addition, there are another 203 towns which are Upazila centres (and other urban centres) and not governed by any Municipal Corporation or &quot;Paurashava&quot;. These are the non-Municipal Corporation or &quot;non-Paurashava&quot; towns.

In 1951, Bangladesh was mostly a rural country and only 4% of the population lived in urban centres. The urban population rose to 20% in 1991 and to 24% by 2001. In 2011, Bangladesh had an urban population of 28% and the rate of urban population growth was estimated at 2.8%. At this growth rate, Bangladesh&#x27;s urban population would reach 79 million or 42% of the population by 2035. The urban centers of Bangladesh have a combined area of about 10600 square kilometers, which is 7% of the total area of Bangladesh. As such, Bangladesh has a very high urban population density: 4028 persons per square kilometer (2011), whereas the rural density is significantly lower: 790 persons per square kilometer (2011). The number of municipalities tripled from 104 municipalities in 1991 to 318 municipalities in 2011.

==Major Urban agglomerations== 
There are 9 major urban agglomerations in Bangladesh that are governed by twelve city corporations, which include (Dhaka North, Dhaka South, Narayanganj, and Gazipur) which all part of Greater Dhaka City, Chattogram, Khulna, Cumilla, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Barishal, Mymensingh.


==Cities Rank==
==Metropolitan areas==
All eleven of the aforementioned major cities are designated as metropolitan areas: Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna, Gazipur, Barisal, Sylhet, Rangpur, Comilla and Mymensingh. Metropolitan areas can be loosely defined as a major city combined with some of its adjacent municipalities and peri-urban areas.

==Cities==
In addition to the 9 major cities governed by City Corporations, there are many minor cities which are governed by Municipal Corporations (&quot;pourashava&quot;). Area figures come from the 2011 census or Paurashava websites. Those with populations of over 100,000 (as of 2022 census) are given below:
==Towns==
The following is a list of towns in Bangladesh governed by Municipal Corporations.

== Urban areas by population ==

Dhaka is by far the largest urban area as well as the largest metropolitan area in Bangladesh. Chittagong is the second largest city and urban area in Bangladesh as well as the second largest metropolitan in Bangladesh.

Khulna is the third largest city and second largest port city of the country after Chittagong. Also, the adjoining areas of Khulna are abided by port-related business, industry, governmental foreign investment, and some well-known mega projects. This city also has a rich history of industrialization through the British period. Khulna has also a significant number of tourism industries centered on the largest mangrove forest of the world, the Sundarbans. Cumilla city is also the third developed city after Khulna and Rajshahi. Cumilla is also marked as an economically stronger city compared to other cities after Dhaka and Chittagong. Cumilla city also got a richer regional economy for remittances and the tourism industry. 
Rajshahi is also a big city and is known as the educational city of Bangladesh due to its well-marked educational institutions with better results and better educational performances.
So we can say that the best 5 cities in Bangladesh are Dhaka, Chittagong, Cumilla, Khulna, and Rajshahi. Other major cities with a stronger economy and developer infrastructure after these five best cities are Sylhet, Bogra, Rangpur, Barishal, Jessore, Kushtia, Feni, Cox&#x27;s Bazar, Mymenshing, Dinajpur, Pabna, Brahmanbaria, Narsingdi, Bholo, Gopalganj, etc.

The following table shows the largest populated area within a local government area.

==Biography==

===1970s===
Bots was formed in 1974 by Bonkie Bongaerts and Bertus Borgers. After leaving the band &quot;Dirty Underwear&quot;, Hans Sanders – stuck with a band with no pianist and no saxophone support – chose to team up with Bonkie Bongaerts and form the new group Bots (Dutch &quot;botsen:&quot; &quot;to clash&quot; / BO-nkie Bongaer-TS).
In 1975 the band recorded its first album, &quot;Van Kwaad Tot Erger&quot; (&quot;From Bad To Worse&quot;), with producer Peter Koelewijn. The album places Bots in the centre of attention and the band also makes its debut on national TV. The singles &quot;Het Lied Van De Werkende Jeugd&quot; (&quot;The Song Of The Working Youth&quot;) and &quot;De Man&quot; (&quot;The Man&quot;) are released. The band tours frequently, also in Belgium. By this time Hans Sanders started to claim texts and lyrics he did not actually write. This was only discovered in 1981 when gold-record awards resulted in increased payments for Hans Sanders but not for the other band members.
In 1976 the song &quot;Zeven Dagen Lang&quot; (&quot;Seven Days On End&quot;), a cover version of the Breton folk song &quot;Son ar Chistr&quot; popularised by singer-songwriter Alan Stivell and Bots&#x27; best known song today, ended up on the album &quot;Voor God En Vaderland&quot; (&quot;For God And Country&quot;). Co-producer of the album was Peter Koelewijn. The single reached number 23 in the charts. Themes on the album included feminism, racism, solidarity and militarism. The music showed influences of both folk and pop.

In 1977 Bots toured East Germany. Bots recorded the poem &quot;Rond&quot; (&quot;Round&quot;) by Bert Schierbeek.

In 1978 the third Bots album, &quot;Wie Zwijgt Stemt Toe&quot; (&quot;Silence Lends Consent&quot;), and is also recorded with Peter Koelewijn. The band&#x27;s lineup includes Sanders and Bongaerts expanded with sax and flute player Piet Engel, Peter de Vries (bass) and Frans Meijer (drums). The single &quot;Popmuzikant&quot; (&quot;Pop Musician&quot;) hit the charts. Together with Eindhoven-based theatre group Proloog, Bots created the musical Barst.

In 1979 Bots worked with Proloog on the Bots Rood Show. This musical theatre production was not very successful. Bots also played in West Germany. They started with Dutch-language songs but soon they are asked to sing in German.

===1980s===
In 1980 Bots recorded the album &quot;Je Voelt Pas Nattigheid Als Je Droog Komt Te Staan&quot; (&quot;You Won&#x27;t Smell A Rat Until You Come Across One&quot;) with producer Peter Koelewijn. In the autumn the band&#x27;s first German-language album came out. &quot;Aufstehn!&quot; (&quot;Stand Up!&quot;) contains German versions of songs like &quot;Zeven Dagen Lang&quot; (de:&quot;Sieben Tage Lang&quot; en:&quot;Seven Days On End&quot;) and Ali. The songs were translated by German authors Günter Wallraff, Henning Venske and Peter Tobiasch.

In 1981 Bots sold over 400,000 copies of &quot;Aufstehn!&quot; and its followup &quot;Entrüstung&quot; (&quot;Indignation&quot;, also Ent-Rüstung = &quot;Dis-Armament&quot; (correctly: en:disarmament = de:Abrüstung) ). The songs were translated by German authors Günter Wallraff, Dieter Hildebrandt, Hanns Dieter Hüsch and Henning Venske. The success also had a downside and there were many changes in the band&#x27;s lineup. Bots now includes Broer Bogaart (drums) and Noudt Jansen (bass).

In 1981–1982 there was a major dispute within the band and between the band and producers/record companies. Hans Sanders had been holding back money from everyone. Due to these disputes, the band&#x27;s lineup changed completely. The band has not been supported by a major record company nor recorded a popular hit since.

In 1983 the third German-language &quot;Schön Krank&quot; (&quot;Considerable&quot; (slang) &quot;Sick&quot;) was recorded, with very little success or sales. The band was on the road a lot and played for free in front of half a million people at the &quot;Künstler Für Den Frieden&quot; (&quot;Artists For Peace&quot;) festival in West Berlin.
From 1985 until 1988 Sjoerd van Bommel was the band&#x27;s drummer. In 1986 the German-language record &quot;Lass Die Sterne Stehen&quot; was released. In 1988 the band played in Germany.

===1990s===
In 1990 the Dutch-language album &quot;Paradijs&quot; (&quot;Paradise&quot;) was recorded and released on the Free label in May. The album was produced by Sanders and keyboard player/singer Kees Buenen. Bots sporadically performed in their hometown, Eindhoven.

In 1997, when football team PSV Eindhoven wins the national championships, Sanders re-recorded his classic &quot;Zeven Dagen Lang&quot; and turned it into &quot;Zeven Jaren Lang&quot; (&quot;Seven Years On End&quot;). Former BOTS band members and fans were insulted by the way Sanders rewrote the song and publicly tried to claim Bots&#x27; heritage.

===2000s===
In 2001 Bots still tours (drives around) but seldom plays. During the Folkwoods Festival in August the band&#x27;s lineup included Sanders, Buenen, George Koenraad (drums/vocals), Erik van Donkersgoed (guitar/vocals) and Anton Wannemakers (bass).

In 2007 lead singer Hans Sanders dies. The band is looking for a replacement to sing the rest of the numbers written for the new album.

<text>Rachel Joy Scott (August 5, 1981 – April 20, 1999) was an American student who was the first fatality of the Columbine High School massacre, during which 11 other students and a teacher were also murdered by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who then committed suicide.

Scott has been revered by groups of evangelical Christians as a Christian martyr. She posthumously was the subject and co-writer of several books, and also was the inspiration for Rachel&#x27;s Challenge, an international school outreach program and the most popular school assembly program in the U.S. The aim of Rachel&#x27;s Challenge is to advocate Scott&#x27;s values, based on her life, her journals, and the contents of a two-page essay, penned a month before her murder, entitled &quot;My Ethics; My Codes of Life&quot;. This essay advocates her belief in compassion being &quot;the greatest form of love humans have to offer&quot;.

However, the circumstances surrounding her death and martyrdom have been called into question.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Rachel Joy Scott was born on August 5, 1981, in Denver, Colorado. She was the third of five children born to Darrell Scott and Beth (née Nimmo) Scott. The entire family are devout Christians. Her father was a pastor at a church in Lakewood, Colorado, and worked as a sales manager for a Denver-based food company; her mother was a homemaker. Rachel&#x27;s parents divorced in 1988; they maintained a cordial relationship and held joint custody of the children. The following year, Beth and her children relocated to Littleton, Colorado, where she remarried in 1995.

As a child, Scott was an energetic, sociable girl, who displayed concern for the well-being of others, particularly if they were downcast or otherwise in need. She developed a passion for photography and poetry at an early age. Rachel attended Dutch Creek Elementary School and Ken Caryl Middle School before she enrolled in Columbine High School in the ninth grade. At Columbine, she was an attentive, above-average student who displayed a flair for music, acting, drama, and debate. She was a member of the school&#x27;s forensics and drama clubs. Acting did not initially come easily to her, and she had to devote extra effort to succeed in this activity.

===Adolescence and Christian beliefs===
When Scott was 11 in March 1993, she visited the church that her aunt and uncle attended in Shreveport, Louisiana, and chose to commit herself to Christianity. By April 1998, when she was at Columbine High School, five of her closest friends had distanced themselves from her because of her increasing commitment to her faith. Furthermore, because of her faith, she was occasionally subjected to mockery by several of her peers. Rachel documented this in a letter to a relative a year to the day before her death. The letter included the words: &quot;Now that I have begun to walk my talk, they make fun of me. I don&#x27;t even know what I have done. I don&#x27;t even have to say anything, and they turn me away. I have no more personal friends at school. But you know what, it&#x27;s all worth it.&quot;

On many occasions throughout Scott&#x27;s adolescence, her family observed her in prayer both at home and at church. Her mother said that her daughter would regularly pray on her knees, with her head bowed, her hands upon her face, and that often, these particular prayer rituals brought tears to Scott&#x27;s eyes.
On one occasion, this included writing a prayer for one of the future perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre.

By the age of 17, Scott was an attendee of three churches: Celebration Christian Fellowship; Orchard Road Christian Center; and Trinity Christian Center, where she choreographed dances at Sunday service. She was also an active member of church youth groups; at the Orchard Road Christian Center, she attended a youth group named &quot;Breakthrough&quot;, where she displayed a passionate interest in both evangelism and discipleship. Scott wrote in her journals that her spiritual awareness developed greatly through attending this youth group, and she became known as a leading advocate within it.

==Personal life==
Scott struggled with self-esteem issues as a teenager, and has been described by her family as being &quot;blind to her own beauty&quot;. By the age of 17, Rachel, although popular among her peers, would occasionally resist efforts to attend certain social events with her friends out of fear she would succumb to the temptation of drinking alcohol. In her mid-teens, Scott had a serious relationship with a boy, but she chose to end it over concerns that it might develop into a physical encounter.

According to friends, Scott often chose to wear clothes of a style reflecting her colorful personality, and occasionally wore eccentric hats, fedoras, or even pajamas to amuse her companions. In addition to her passion for fashion, music, and photography, she was an avid viewer of classic movies, and often spoke of her desire to become a renowned Hollywood actress. She is known to have conveyed these aspirations to her family and to have combined her sense of humor into everyday family life with lighthearted gestures such as leaving a message on her family&#x27;s answering machine stating: &quot;You have reached the residence of Queen Rachel and her servants, Larry, Beth, Dana, Craig, and Michael. If you have anything you&#x27;d like them to do for me, please leave a message.&quot;

Scott was an aspiring writer and actress. In 1998, she performed a mime act to the song &quot;Watch the Lamb&quot; at the school talent show. The tape jammed halfway through the song and Dylan Klebold, who ran audio for the school theater production club, came to her rescue and fixed the tape, leading her to thank him afterwards. Rachel&#x27;s sister would later perform the same mime act at her funeral.

In order to repay her parents for the Acura Legend they had given her, Scott worked at a Subway sandwich shop on West Coal Mine Avenue in Littleton shortly before she died. In one instance while working there, she felt remorse for not assisting a homeless woman who had come into the store and vowed to be more helpful to such people in the future.

At the time of her death at age 17, Scott lived at 7282 South Vance Street in the Columbine community and was debating as to whether she should become an actress or a Christian missionary. She also had plans to visit Botswana as a member of a Christian outreach program to build homes in the upcoming summer before moving into her own apartment in late 1999.

==Murder==

Scott was eating lunch with her friend Richard Castaldo on the lawn outside the west entrance of the school, when Eric Harris shot her four times with a Hi-Point 995 Initially shot in the chest, left arm, and left leg, from a distance of 10 to 15 feet, she sustained a fourth and fatal wound to her left temple. Castaldo was shot eight times and permanently paralyzed from his injuries. Scott&#x27;s body was left outside where she died and was not retrieved by the coroner until the following morning.

Shortly after Rachel was murdered, Harris and Klebold went on a killing spree around the school, claiming 12 more lives and leaving 24 injured. The two perpetrators committed suicide in the school library, the place where they murdered the most victims. Scott did not personally know Harris or Klebold. After the killings, Scott&#x27;s car was turned into an impromptu memorial in the adjacent Clement Park after being moved from the school&#x27;s parking lot by grieving students. A chain-link fence was also installed around the vehicle for mourners to attach their tokens of grief such as flowers, crucifixes, teddy bears, and letters of condolence. The car was ultimately covered by the objects left upon it by mourners. Scott&#x27;s 16-year-old brother, Craig, was also at the school on the day of the massacre; he was in the library where most of the killings occurred; he survived unharmed, although two of his close friends were also murdered.
Craig later expressed extreme regret for his last interaction with his sister: slamming a car door at her when being dropped off at school that morning.

==Funeral==
Scott was buried at Chapel Hill Memorial Gardens in Centennial on April 24, 1999, following a two-hour funeral service held at the Trinity Christian Center. Her funeral was one of the first services following the massacre and was attended by more than 1,000 people that included friends and staff at Columbine High School. The Reverend Porter began the service by addressing the congregation with the question, &quot;What has happened to us as a people that this should happen to us?&quot; He then addressed the solemn crowd with a speech that included references to Scott&#x27;s pious character, kind nature and love of her fellow human, before stating: &quot;You have graduated early from this life to a far better one, where there is no sorrow, violence or death.&quot; Her friends from the Orchard Road Christian Church Youth Group also sang a song at the service, composed in her honor, entitled &quot;Why Did You Have to Leave?&quot; Attendees were invited to talk at the service, as &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; was played. 

Those conveying their eulogies included one youth who had been considered an outcast at Columbine High School, who stated: &quot;All my life I prayed that someone would love me and make me feel wanted. God sent me an angel,&quot; before staring at Scott&#x27;s casket and weeping. Nick Baumgart, who accompanied Rachel to the high school prom as her date three days before her murder, also spoke, saying: &quot;A truer friend, you couldn&#x27;t find. You could be having the worst day of your entire life; all she had to do was smile.&quot; Scott&#x27;s parents chose not to speak at the service, but issued a statement in which they described their daughter as &quot;a girl whose love of life was constantly reflected in her love and zeal for music, drama, photography, and for her friends&quot;.

Prior to her burial, mourners who had known Scott throughout her life were invited to write messages of condolence, grief and thankfulness on her ivory white casket. Her coffin was adorned with messages of love, gratitude, and grief. The funeral service was broadcast by CNN and MSNBC.

==Legacy==
===Martyrdom===
The circumstances surrounding Scott&#x27;s death and its relation to her religious beliefs are disputed. While Scott&#x27;s mother made several claims, including that she had offered to be friends to Klebold, that Klebold was romantically interested in her, that Klebold and Harris mocked her for her religious beliefs, and that her daughter was on a &quot;target list.&quot;, investigations in the years following the shooting—especially Dave Cullen&#x27;s findings in his book &quot;Columbine&quot;—have concluded that Klebold and Harris were not targeting people for their religion, ethnicity, or gender. Scott did not know the two boys personally and was in a different academic grade than them. 

The deaths of both Scott and fellow student and Columbine victim Cassie Bernall were both subsequently described by groups of evangelical Christians as Christian martyrs. This began during Scott&#x27;s funeral on April 24, 1999, which was televised. At the beginning of the ceremony, Barry Palser, a pastor from an Assemblies of God organization, gave a speech in which he said she was &quot;one who has given [her] life for the Lord Jesus Christ, a modern-day martyr.&quot; Pastor Bruce Porter delivered a sermon later in the service, in which he called Rachel a &quot;warrior&quot; who carried &quot;a torch that was stained by the blood of the martyrs from the very first day of the Church&#x27;s existence&quot;. Porter then requested that others pick up the &quot;torch&quot; in Scott&#x27;s wake. 

In the following year&#x27;s numerous books—termed &quot;hagiographies&quot; by sociologist Ralph Larkin—were published about Scott and Bernall with the assistance of or authorship by their parents. Porter also wrote a book about Scott, making frequent references to sacrifice. Many web pages have been published that are specifically dedicated to Scott and she is prominently featured in more broadly themed Columbine memorial websites. Some of these sites explicitly or implicitly refer to Scott&#x27;s belief in Christianity and suggest that she was killed because of it. Journalist Hanna Rosin framed public remembrance of her death as part of a phenomenon in which teenage Christians began obsessing over Christian-based death, as a form of a martyr complex. Scott&#x27;s mother and her brother Craig toured many schools across the United States years after the shooting to speak about Rachel&#x27;s life, asserting that she probably died because of her religious beliefs. Christian churches used the martyr narrative of Scott&#x27;s and Bernall&#x27;s deaths to promote themselves and recruit members.

A frequent feature of Rachel&#x27;s martyr story is that she had a verbal exchange with Klebold and Harris about her religious beliefs before they killed her. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; accounts that Richard Castaldo, who was shot while sitting with Scott and survived, &quot;told a newspaper that not only did the killers ask Rachel about her faith but that he, too, was asked if he believed in God, and he answered truthfully that he did not, and his life was spared.&quot; Other sources report that Castaldo had survived by &quot;playing dead&quot;. Castaldo was in a coma in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, and thus did not testify to police and his account was not included in the police report on the event. Castaldo said in his speech at Scott&#x27;s funeral, &quot;People tell me I said she said she believed in God, and I can&#x27;t remember it,&quot; and Larkin wrote in 2007 that Castaldo &quot;could not remember Klebold or Harris saying anything.&quot;

===&quot;Rachel&#x27;s Tears&quot;===

Reviewing their daughter&#x27;s life and hearing firsthand just how profound an impact Scott&#x27;s simple acts of kindness had imprinted on the lives of those who had known her, as well as recalling her repeatedly stated desire for her life to have an impact for the better on others, Darrell Scott and Beth Nimmo were inspired to write the book &quot;Rachel&#x27;s Tears&quot;, a non-fiction book about their daughter, her faith, her inspirational journal entries, and the impact of her loss on their lives. The book was published on the first anniversary of her death, and is incorporated into the Rachel&#x27;s Challenge program.

Scott and Nimmo later published two more books inspired by their daughter and her legacy: &quot;Rachel Smiles: The Spiritual Legacy of Columbine Martyr Rachel Scott&quot;, and &quot;The Journals of Rachel Joy Scott: A Journey of Faith at Columbine High&quot;. These books were published in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Both parents have expressed their hope that those who did not know their daughter would find inspiration in the books&#x27; description of the principles their daughter had lived during her life.

==Rachel&#x27;s Challenge==

After reading the essay, &quot;My Ethics; My Codes of Life&quot;, and the journals Scott had written in the last 16 months of her life, her father founded Rachel&#x27;s Challenge in 2001. Rachel&#x27;s Challenge is a national nonprofit and nonpolitical organization whose stated aims are to advocate a safe and positive climate and culture in schools in a campaign to quell school violence, bullying, discrimination, and both homicidal and suicidal thoughts in students. Through the more than 50 designated speakers and the international expansion of Rachel&#x27;s Challenge, the annual international student outreach of the organization is estimated to be in excess of two million. The program itself typically involves a one-hour audio and video presentation, hosted by the Rachel&#x27;s Challenge speaker, to assembled students, with the aim of motivating those present to analyze how they treat others. The Rachel&#x27;s Challenge speakers include Darrell, Craig and Mike Scott; guest speakers include Nicole Nowlen, who was wounded at age 16 in the Columbine High School massacre, and Adam Kyler, a former Columbine student who had harbored suicidal thoughts until Rachel, noting he was the victim of bullying, offered her friendship and support.

Each attendee is asked to pledge to accept the five principles discussed during the presentation before leaving the assembly: to eliminate any form of prejudice from their being, and seek only the best in others; to keep a journal and seek to achieve accomplishments; to choose to accept only positive influences in their lives; to commit to bringing a positive change in their home, school, and community through kind words, and undertaking tasks great and small; and to show care and compassion to those who are vulnerable, ridiculed, or in any form of need. A final impetus is to commit to Rachel&#x27;s theory of the formation of a chain reaction through these five pledges by sharing these commitments with their family members, friends, and peers.

At the close of the program, the audience is asked to close their eyes, and picture five or six people closest to them; they are then asked to tell them how much they mean to them. The initial presentation is followed by a 45-minute, interactive training session involving both adult and student leaders. Participants are trained to perpetuate the chain reaction of kindness envisioned by Scott. The participating school is provided with a curriculum and a training manual to ensure the continuity of the objectives of Rachel&#x27;s Challenge, and the speaker typically holds a meeting later with parents and community leaders.

Internationally, many schools have incorporated Rachel&#x27;s Challenge into their internal character building programs, with active efforts made to eradicate any sense of alienation among the student population, and various initiatives implemented to increase cohesion. One initiative to achieve this objective is to establish a &quot;Friends of Rachel&quot; club, to sustain the campaign&#x27;s goals on an ongoing basis. In addition, many students actively seek to honor Scott&#x27;s theory of just one person displaying compassion having the potential to spark a chain reaction of the same by spreading her message of kindness, empathy and compassion with their fellow students.

As a direct result of Rachel&#x27;s Challenge, numerous child and teenage suicides have been prevented and in seven known cases, planned school shootings have been prevented.
The Random Acts of Kindness Foundation posthumously awarded Scott the 2001 National Kindness Award for Student of the Year. The award was in recognition of her efforts to eradicate negativity, discord, and alienation in those she encountered during her life and to replace these negative influences with care and compassion.

In the wake of the 2006 West Nickel Mines School shooting, Craig Scott was formally invited to address a National Council on issues relating to safety and security in schools. This meeting was held at the White House with President George W. Bush and included White House staff and educators from across the nation. The conference focused on cultural issues and the accomplishments and personal experiences garnered through Rachel&#x27;s Challenge. President Bush requested a copy of the speech, and Craig Scott was later invited back to the White House to speak further on these issues.

In a direct recognition of the significant, ongoing, national benefits achieved in schools, colleges, and universities through Rachel&#x27;s Challenge, the National Education Association of New York awarded Darrell Scott and Rachel&#x27;s Challenge the &quot;Friend of Education Award&quot; in 2006. Darrell Scott was selected as the 2009 winner of the &quot;All-Stars Among Us&quot; initiative in recognition of his selfless dedication toward preserving his daughter&#x27;s memory in a positive manner through Rachel&#x27;s Challenge in the U.S.

Along with 29 other recipients, Scott was formally honored as part of the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game ceremonies, held in St. Louis, Missouri, on July 14 that year. At this ceremony, Darrell Scott stated: &quot;Rachel loved to watch baseball. She had no clue that because of her memory ... I&#x27;d be here representing her.&quot; Both of Scott&#x27;s parents have also spoken with entertainers, world leaders, and notable individuals including Miep Gies – one of the people who hid Anne Frank and her family from the Nazis, and preserved her diary after her capture.

Darrell Scott has stated that reliving his daughter&#x27;s death giving his Rachel&#x27;s Challenge speeches is painful, but that he and his family consider the opportunity to be a worthwhile experience as they can turn a tragedy into triumph. He notes: &quot;I feel that God has really called me to do this. To pick up the torch my daughter dropped. This is what my daughter would have wanted to see. If I died right now, I can tell you my daughter&#x27;s prayer has been answered.&quot; Rachel&#x27;s mother, on the 10th anniversary of her daughter&#x27;s passing, stated: &quot;Only through eternal eyes will she ever know how powerful her life and death became.&quot;

<text>Béla III (, , ; 114823 April 1196) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1172 and 1196. He was the second son of King Géza II and Géza&#x27;s wife, Euphrosyne of Kiev. Around 1161, Géza granted Béla a duchy, which included Croatia, central Dalmatia and possibly Sirmium. In accordance with a peace treaty between his elder brother, Stephen III, who succeeded their father in 1162, and the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, Béla moved to Constantinople in 1163. He was renamed to Alexios, and the emperor granted him the newly created senior court title of &quot;despotes&quot;. He was betrothed to the Emperor&#x27;s daughter, Maria. Béla&#x27;s patrimony caused armed conflicts between the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary between 1164 and 1167, because Stephen III attempted to hinder the Byzantines from taking control of Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium. Béla-Alexios, who was designated as Emperor Manuel&#x27;s heir in 1165, took part in three Byzantine campaigns against Hungary. His betrothal to the emperor&#x27;s daughter was dissolved after her brother, Alexios, was born in 1169. The emperor deprived Béla of his high title, granting him the inferior rank of &quot;kaisar&quot;.

Stephen III died on 4 March 1172, and Béla decided to return to Hungary. Before his departure, he pledged that he would never make war against the Byzantine Empire. Although the Hungarian prelates and lords unanimously proclaimed Béla king, Lucas, Archbishop of Esztergom opposed his coronation because of Béla&#x27;s alleged simony. Finally, the Archbishop of Kalocsa crowned him king on 18 January 1173, with Pope Alexander III&#x27;s approval. Béla fought with his younger brother, Géza, whom he held in captivity for more than a decade. Taking advantage of the internal conflicts in the Byzantine Empire after Emperor Manuel&#x27;s death, Béla reoccupied Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium between 1180 and 1181. He occupied the Principality of Halych in 1188, but it was lost within two years.

Béla promoted the use of written records during his reign. Hungarian chronicles from the 14th century even state that he was responsible for the establishment of the Royal Chancery. The royal palace built in Esztergom during his reign was the first example of Gothic architecture in Central Europe. He was the wealthiest European monarch of his time, according to a list of his revenues, but the reliability of the list is questioned.

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ( 1148–1163) ===

Béla was the second son of Géza II of Hungary and Géza&#x27;s wife, Euphrosyne of Kiev. The date of his birth was not recorded. Studies of his bones show that Béla died in 1196 at around 49 years old, so he must have been born around 1148.

The contemporaneous John Kinnamos&#x27;s reference to &quot;the territory which his father, while still alive, had apportioned&quot; to Béla shows that Géza II granted a distinct territory as an appanage to his younger son. Béla&#x27;s patrimony certainly included the central parts of Dalmatia, (which included Šibenik, Split, and Trogir, which had accepted the suzerainty of the Kings of Hungary for decades), because Kinnamos mentioned the province &quot;as Béla&#x27;s heritage&quot;. Historians Ferenc Makk and Gyula Moravcsik agree that Béla also received Croatia from his father. Whether Syrmium was also part of Béla&#x27;s patrimony, or if he only acquired it after his father&#x27;s death is subject to scholarly debates. According to historian Warren Treadgold, Béla&#x27;s patrimony also included Bosnia. The exact date of Géza II&#x27;s grant cannot be determined, but according to Makk, Béla seems to have received his duchy around 1161.

Géza II, who died on 31 May 1162, was succeeded by his first-born son, Stephen III. Stephen III seems to have confirmed Béla&#x27;s possession of the duchy, because Kinnamos referred to the land which was &quot;long before granted&quot; to Béla by Géza and Stephen. Shortly after his ascension to the throne, Stephen III was expelled by his uncles, Ladislaus II and Stephen IV. The Byzantine Emperor, Manuel I Komnenos, supported the uncles&#x27; takeover, but Stephen III returned to Hungary and regained his crown by force in the middle of 1163. Béla probably remained neutral during his brother&#x27;s conflict with their uncles, because there is no report of Béla&#x27;s activities in 1162 and 1163.

In 1163, Emperor Manuel signed a peace treaty with Stephen III, in which he renounced his support of Stephen&#x27;s opponents. In exchange, Stephen III agreed to send Béla to Constantinople, and to allow the Byzantines to take possession of Béla&#x27;s duchy. The Emperor also promised that he would betroth his daughter, Maria, to Béla.

=== &quot;Despotes&quot; Alexios (1163–1169) ===

Emperor Manuel dispatched &quot;sebastos&quot; George Palaiologos to escort Béla to the Byzantine Empire. Béla arrived in Constantinople around the end of 1163. He was renamed to Alexios, and received the title of &quot;despotes&quot; (&quot;lord&quot;), which only emperors had used before that time. Béla&#x27;s betrothal to the emperor&#x27;s daughter was also officially announced.

Stephen III invaded Syrmium in the summer of 1164. Emperor Manuel led his armies against Stephen, stating that he arrived &quot;not to wage war on the Hungarians but to recover his land for Béla&quot;, according to Kinnamos. Béla-Alexiosalong with his uncle, Stephen IV, and their distant relative, Stephanos Kalamanosaccompanied the emperor during the campaign. Before long, a new peace treaty was signed, once again forcing Stephen III to renounce Béla&#x27;s duchy. A Byzantine army occupied Syrmium, which was organized into a Byzantine theme, or district.

Stephen III launched a new invasion against Syrmium in the spring of 1165. Emperor Manuel directed the counter-attack, and Béla accompanied him again. After the imperial army recaptured Zimony (now Zemun in Serbia), Béla persuaded the emperor to prohibit the execution of the Hungarian soldiers who were captured in the fortress. A Byzantine army also occupied Dalmatia. A new peace treaty between Stephen III and Emperor Manuel followed, which confirmed the emperor&#x27;s suzerainty in Béla&#x27;s former duchy. Dalmatia and Bosnia were soon converted into Byzantine themes.

Emperor Manuel ceremoniously made his daughter and Béla-Alexios his heirs, and forced the Byzantine notables to swear an oath of fidelity to them in the autumn of 1165. Only the emperor&#x27;s cousin, Andronikos Komnenos, dared to condemn this act, asking, &quot;What madness is this of the emperor to deem every Roman male unworthy of his daughter&#x27;s nuptial bed, to choose before all others this foreigner and interloper to be an emperor of the Romans and to sit above all as master?&quot;, according to the nearly contemporaneous Niketas Choniates. Béla-Alexios participated in the 1166 Council of Blachernae, together with Emperor Manuel and the Ecumenical Patriarch Luke Chrysoberges. In the spring of 1166, Béla-Alexios accompanied &quot;protostrator&quot; Alexios Axouch, who led a Byzantine army against Hungary in retaliation for a new Hungarian invasion of Syrmium. On 11 April 1166, although Béla-Alexios and his bride were related to each other, Emperor Manuel confirmed a decision of the Ecumenical Patriarch, which stated that marriages between kin to the seventh degree were void. Manuel even proposed a marriage between his daughter (Béla-Alexios&#x27;s fiancée) and the new King of Sicily, William II, in the autumn of 1166.

A new war broke out between Hungary and the Byzantine Empire in 1167, because Béla-Alexios &quot;claimed the kingdom&quot; of his brother, according to the contemporaneous Rahewin. Henry of Mügeln also wrote that many Hungarians joined and served the army of Béla-Alexios, stating that &quot;the Kingdom of Hungary belonged to him [Béla-Alexios] by right&quot;. On 8 July 1167, the Byzantine army annihilated the Hungarian troops in the Battle of Sirmium. A peace treaty was signed, which put an end to the period of wars between Hungary and the Byzantine Empire, and confirmed the dominion of the Byzantine Empire over central Dalmatia, Bosnia and Syrmium.

=== &quot;Kaisar&quot; Alexios (1169–1172) ===
Emperor Manuel&#x27;s wife, Maria of Antioch, gave birth to a son named Alexios on 14 September 1169. The emperor dissolved his daughter&#x27;s betrothal to Béla-Alexios. The emperor also removed Béla-Alexios&#x27;s title of &quot;despotes&quot;, but granted him the inferior rank of &quot;kaisar&quot;. In the spring of 1170, Béla-Alexios married the emperor&#x27;s sister-in-law, Agnes of Antioch. The couple went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. In Jerusalem, they donated 10,000 bezants to the Knights Hospitaller in compensation for their hospitality. In the charter of grant, Béla-Alexios styled himself &quot;Lord A., Duke of Hungary, Dalmatia and Croatia&quot;, ignoring the title that the emperor had recently bestowed upon him.

== Reign ==
=== Coronation (1172–1173) ===

Béla&#x27;s brother, Stephen III, died on 4 March 1172. Arnold of Lübeck, who was staying in Esztergom, recorded a rumor suggesting that Stephen had been poisoned by Béla&#x27;s supporters, but no other source verifies this hearsay. Stephen III&#x27;s widow, Agnes, left Hungary, although she was pregnant when her husband died. A Hungarian delegation visited Emperor Manuel and Béla in Sardica (now Sophia in Bulgaria). They demanded that &quot;Béla be dispatched to them as king&quot;, because &quot;the principle of justice looked toward him&quot; after his brother&#x27;s death, according to Kinnamos. Kinnamos also said that Emperor Manuel made Béla king after Béla &quot;promised an oath to observe for the whole course of his life whatever would be beneficial&quot; to the emperor and the Byzantines. A letter written by the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos in 1196 says that on the same occasion, Béla pledged that he would never support the Serbians if they fought against the Byzantine Empire.

Béla and his wife arrived in Székesfehérvár in late April or early May. Béla was unanimously elected king by the &quot;dignitaries of the Hungarian kingdom&quot;, according to a letter written by Pope Alexander III in 1179. However, Béla&#x27;s coronation was delayed, because Lucas, Archbishop of Esztergom, refused to perform it. The archbishop accused the king of simony, because Béla had given a precious cloak to his delegate. According to a scholarly theory, Archbishop Lucas also feared that the influence of &quot;schismatics&quot; would increase under Béla&#x27;s rule. Nevertheless, the majority of the barons and prelates remained loyal to Béla. Béla sought the assistance of the Holy See against the Archbishop Lucas. Upon Béla&#x27;s request, Pope Alexander III authorized the Archbishop of Kalocsa to anoint Béla king and &quot;place the crown on his head&quot;. Béla&#x27;s coronation took place on 18 January 1173. He issued a charter confirming the right of the archbishops of Esztergom to crown the Hungarian monarchs. The unification of the so-called &quot;Greek&quot; and &quot;Latin&quot; crowns into the Holy Crown of Hungary seems to have occurred during his reign.

=== Conflicts (1173–1178) ===

Archbishop Lucas fell out of favor with Béla, and was ignored by him in the first years of his reign. Instead of Lucas, the Archbishop of Kalocsa baptized Béla&#x27;s first-born son, Emeric, in 1174. However, administering sacraments to members of the royal family had always been the archbishops of Esztergom&#x27;s job. According to a Bohemian chronicle (&quot;Continuatio Gerlaci abbatis Milovicensis&quot;), Béla imprisoned his younger brother, Géza, but Géza escaped from prison and fled to Austria in 1174 or 1175. Stephen III&#x27;s judge royal, Lawrence, accompanied Géza. When Henry Jasomirgott, Duke of Austria, refused to extradite Géza, Béla launched plundering raids into Austria, together with Soběslav II, Duke of Bohemia. Meanwhile, Béla sent reinforcements to Emperor Manuel to help him fight against the Seljuks, but their united forces suffered defeat in the Battle of Myriokephalon on 17 September 1176.

Géza tried to persuade Soběslav II of Bohemia to help him meet Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, but Soběslav seized Géza and handed him over to Béla in 1177. Béla once again imprisoned his brother, and he also put their mother, Euphrosyne, in confinement. In retaliation for Soběslav&#x27;s role in Géza&#x27;s capture, Emperor Frederick dethroned Soběslav and appointed another member of the Přemyslid dynasty, Frederick, to the position of duke. The Holy Roman Emperor ordered the new Duke of Austria, Leopold V, to storm Bohemia. Béla soon intervened, threatening Leopold V with an invasion, which forced Leopold to leave Bohemia.

=== Expansion and reforms (1178–1194) ===

Béla&#x27;s long-time favorite, Andrew, Archbishop of Kalocsa, insulted him around 1178. Béla soon deprived him and his supporter, the Provost of Székesfehérvár Chapter, of their offices and seized the Archbishop&#x27;s revenues. Pope Alexander III punished Béla with ecclesiastic sanctions, but Béla reconciled with Archbishop Lucas of Esztergom, who absolved him and excommunicated Andrew of Kalocsa. The conflict ended with a compromise mediated by the Holy See: Andrew asked Béla to pardon him, and Béla restored him to his position of archbishop.

Upon Béla&#x27;s invitation, Cistercian monks came from France and set up new Cistercian abbeys at Egres, Zirc, Szentgotthárd and Pilis between 1179 and 1184. In the 1180s, Béla initiated the building of a lofty royal castle and a new cathedral in Esztergom. Nevertheless, he was almost always wandering around the country. According to an inscription on a brick found in Bulkeszi (now Maglić in Serbia), Béla sponsored the baptism of a German &quot;guest settler&quot; in that village.

In the imperial court of Constantinople, Béla learnt the importance of a well-organized administration. According to the Illuminated Chronicle, Béla &quot;introduced the same form of addressing petitions as was customary in the Roman and imperial court&quot;, which suggests that the Royal Chancery began functioning as a separate office during his reign. He emphasized the importance of written records, ordering in 1181 that a charter was to be issued for all transactions proceeding in his presence.

Emperor Manuel I died on 24 September 1180. Within six months, Béla had restored his suzerainty in Dalmatia, but no detailed contemporaneous accounts of the events exist. The citizens of Split &quot;returned to Hungarian lordship&quot; soon after Manuel&#x27;s death, according to the 13th-century Thomas the Archdeacon. Zadar also accepted Béla&#x27;s suzerainty in early 1181. Historian John V. A. Fine writes that Béla retook suzerainty of Dalmatia &quot;seemingly without bloodshed and with imperial consent&quot;, because the Byzantine authorities preferred that Béla rule the province rather than the Republic of Venice.

The details of the reconquest of Syrmium are also obscure. Andronikos Komnenos accused the mother of the young Byzantine Emperor, Alexios II, of inciting Bélaher brother-in-lawto ravage the region of Belgrade and Barancs (now Braničevo in Serbia) in May 1182, implying that Béla had by that time occupied Syrmium. In the same month, Andronikos Komnenos captured the Dowager Empress and had her murdered by the end of the year. Taking advantage of the emerging anarchy in the Byzantine Empire, Béla advanced as far as Niš and Serdica in the first half of 1183. In Sardica, he seized the casket containing the relics of Saint Ivan of Rila, and ordered it &quot;to be transported with great honors to his land and to be laid down with honor in the church&quot; of Esztergom, according to the saint&#x27;s &quot;Life from the Sofia Prologue&quot;. Makk writes that Béla withdrew from the regions south of the Danube, but historian Paul Stephenson says that Béla preserved these lands.

Andronikos Komnenos murdered Emperor Alexios II in late 1183. The contemporaneous Eustathius of Thessalonica writes that Andronikos&#x27;s opponents sent letters to many monarchs, including Béla III, urging them to attack Andronikos. According to Ansbert and other Western European chroniclers, Béla invaded the Byzantine Empire in early 1185. After Andronikos I fell in September, Béla signed a peace treaty with the new emperor, Isaac II Angelos. Isaac married Béla&#x27;s daughter, Margaret, and Béla granted the region of Niš and Barancs to Isaac as his daughter&#x27;s dowry. The relics of Saint Ivan of Rila were also returned to Sardica on this occasion. Béla married Margaret of France, a sister of Philip II of France, in the summer of 1186.

Orio Mastropiero, Doge of Venice, laid siege to Zadar in 1187, but the Venetian fleet could not seize the well-fortified town. Vladimir Yaroslavich, Prince of Halych, fled to Hungary at the end of 1188, because his boyars had rebelled. Roman Mstyslavych, Prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia, soon occupied Halych, but Béla invaded the principality and expelled him. Instead of restoring Vladimir Yaroslavich to his former position, Béla imprisoned him and granted control of Halych to Andrew, who was Béla&#x27;s younger son. As a token of his conquest, Béla styled himself as King of Galicia. .

In the summer of 1189, German crusaders marched through Hungary under the command of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Béla welcomed Frederick, and dispatched a troop to escort the crusaders across the Balkan Peninsula. At Frederick&#x27;s request, Béla released his imprisoned brother, Géza, who joined the crusaders and left Hungary. Béla mediated a peace treaty between Frederick I and Isaac II, whose mutual distrust had almost caused war between the German crusaders and the Byzantines.

Vladimir Yaroslavich escaped from captivity in early 1189 or 1190. With the assistance of Casimir II of Poland, he expelled Andrew from Halych, and regained control of the principality. In 1191, Béla met his son-in-law, Isaac II, in Philippopolis (now Plovdiv in Bulgaria) and Syrmium, but the results of their negotiations remained unknown. Upon Béla&#x27;s request, the Holy See approved the canonization of Ladislaus I of Hungary in 1192. Béla invaded Serbia at the beginning of 1193. Isaac II demanded the withdrawal of his troops, and threatened Béla with war. At the same time, Doge Enrico Dandolo attempted to occupy Zadar, but failed. In 1193, Béla granted Modruš County in Croatia to Bartholomew of Krk, a member of the Frankopan family. This is the earliest certain example of an office being granted as a hereditary dignity in the Kingdom of Hungary.

=== Last years (1194–1196) ===
In 1194, Béla appointed his eldest son, Emeric, who had already been crowned as the future king, to administer Croatia and Dalmatia. After a united Bulgarian, Cumanian and Vlach army defeated the Byzantines in the Battle of Arcadiopolis in 1194, Béla was willing to assist the Byzantine Empire. However, his campaign was cancelled, because Béla&#x27;s son-in-law, Emperor Isaac II, was dethroned by Alexios III Angelos in April 1195. Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, was planning to launch a campaign against the Byzantine Empire on behalf of the dethroned emperor, but Béla prohibited his subjects from joining Henry.

Béla took the cross as a token of his desire to lead a crusade to the Holy Land. However, he could not fulfill his oath, because he fell ill and died on 23 April 1196. He was buried in the Székesfehérvár Cathedral. His remains were confidently identified by archeologists during 19th-century excavations, because a contemporaneous sourceRichard of Londonwrote of Béla&#x27;s exceptional height. Béla&#x27;s skeleton shows that he was tall. Béla&#x27;s remains were reinterred at the Matthias Church in Budapest. The DNA from skeletal remains of Béla and of another presumed member of the Árpád dynasty, scholars propose that the dynasty belonged to Y-haplogroup R1a subclade R-SUR51 &gt; R-ARP.

== Family ==
Béla&#x27;s first wife, Agnes, was the daughter of Raynald of Châtillon, Prince of Antioch, and Raynald&#x27;s wife, Constance of Antioch. Agnes was born around 1149 and died around 1184. At the time of her marriage in 1170, she was renamed Anna in Constantinople.

Béla&#x27;s and Agnes-Anna&#x27;s first child, Emeric, was born in 1174. Emeric&#x27;s sister, Margaret, who was renamed Maria in Constantinople, was born in 1175. At the age of nine or ten, she was given in marriage to the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who was about 30 at the time. Maria&#x27;s husband died in 1204, before the Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. Margaret–Maria married one of the leaders of the Crusade, Boniface of Montferrat, who seized Thessaloniki after the fall of the Byzantine Empire. Historian Makk writes that in about 1210, Maria married Nicholas I of Saint Omer after the death of Boniface, but scholar Peter Lock says that Saint Omer&#x27;s wife and Margaret–Maria were not identical.

The second son of Béla and Agnes-Anna, Andrew, was born around 1177. His two younger brothers, Solomon and Stephen, did not survive infancy. Their younger sister, Constance, married King Ottokar I of Bohemia in about 1198. A third daughter of Béla and Agnes-Anna, whose name is unknown, died in infancy.

After the death of Agnes-Anna, Béla proposed to Theodora, a granddaughter of Emperor Manuel I&#x27;s sister, Theodora Komnene. However, a synod of the Byzantine Church forbade the marriage in 1185, because Theodora had entered a nunnery. In late 1185 or at the beginning of 1186, Béla asked for the hand of Matilda of Saxony, a daughter of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, but Henry II of England, Matilda&#x27;s grandfather, hindered this marriage. Finally, Béla married Henry II&#x27;s widowed daughter-in-law, Margaret of France, in the summer of 1186. She was the daughter of Louis VII of France. Queen Margaret outlived Béla, and moved to the Holy Land after his death.

== Legacy ==
Béla was one of the most eminent medieval monarchs of Hungary. His &quot;rule not only represented the apogee of the kingdom of the Árpádians, but also marked the end of an epoch&quot;, according to historian Pál Engel. His establishment of the Royal Chancery contributed to the &quot;expansion of written records&quot; in Hungary; the first charters issued by barons appeared in the 1190s. According to a contemporaneous list of Béla&#x27;s revenues, his yearly income amounted to almost 170,000 marks (about 23 tonnes of pure silver). If the list is reliable, his income surpassed the revenues of the contemporaneous Kings of France and England, but the reliability of the list has been questioned by many historians, including Pál Engel.

In about 1190, after a fire destroyed Esztergom, Béla invited French masons to rebuild the royal palace and the cathedral. The masons introduced new architectural forms; the new royal palace and cathedral were the earliest examples of Gothic architecture in Central Europe. Coins depicting a two-barred cross, which was primarily used in the Church of the Byzantine Empire, were minted from around 1190, suggesting that the so-called &quot;double cross&quot; became part of the Hungarian royal heraldry under Béla III.

<text>Marshall Herff Applewhite Jr. (May 17, 1931 – March 26, 1997), also known as Do, among other names, was an American religious leader who founded and led the Heaven&#x27;s Gate new religious movement (often described as a cult), and organized their mass suicide in 1997. The suicide is the largest mass suicide to occur inside the U.S.

As a young man, Applewhite attended several universities and served in the United States Army. He initially pursued a career in education until he resigned from the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas, in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father&#x27;s death a year later brought on severe depression. In 1972, Applewhite developed a close friendship with Bonnie Nettles, a nurse; together, they discussed mysticism at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while and then began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to spread their views. They gained only one convert. In August 1974, Applewhite was arrested in Harlingen, Texas, for failing to return a rental car and was extradited to Missouri where he was subsequently jailed for six months. In jail, he further developed his theology.

After Applewhite&#x27;s release, he and Nettles travelled to California and Oregon, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. They told their followers that they would be visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement and American popular culture.

Heaven&#x27;s Gate received an influx of funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s, the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp and rumors of an accompanying spaceship, concluding that this was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in a rented mansion. A media circus followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers&#x27; willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to their faith in the narrative that he constructed.

==Early life and education==
Marshall Herff Applewhite Jr. was born in Spur, Texas, on May 17, 1931, to Marshall Herff Applewhite Sr. (1901–1971) and his wife Louise (née Winfield; 1901–1988). He had three siblings. The son of a Presbyterian minister, Applewhite became very religious as a child.

Applewhite attended Corpus Christi High School and Austin College; at the latter school, he was active in several student organizations and was moderately religious. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy in 1952 and subsequently enrolled at Union Presbyterian Seminary to study theology, hoping to become a minister. He married Anne Pearce around that time, and they later had two children, Mark and Lane. Early in his seminary studies, Applewhite decided to leave the school to pursue a career in music, becoming the music director of a Presbyterian church in North Carolina. He was a baritone singer and enjoyed spirituals and the music of Handel.

In 1954, Applewhite was drafted by the United States Army and served in Austria and New Mexico as a member of the Army Signal Corps. He left the military in 1956 and enrolled at the University of Colorado, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in music and focused on musical theater.

==Career==
Applewhite moved to New York City in an unsuccessful attempt to begin a professional singing career upon finishing his education in Colorado. He then taught at the University of Alabama (UA). Applewhite lost his position there after pursuing a sexual relationship with a male student; society was not supportive of same-sex relationships and he was subsequently frustrated by his sexual desires. He separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in 1965, and they divorced three years later. When Applewhite revealed to his parents that he was homosexual, his father rejected him.

In 1965, after leaving UA, Applewhite moved to Houston to serve as chair of the music department at the University of St. Thomas. His students regarded him as an engaging speaker and a stylish dresser. He also became a locally popular singer, serving as the choral director of an Episcopal church and performing with the Houston Grand Opera. In Houston, Applewhite was briefly openly gay but also pursued a relationship with a young woman, who left him under pressure from her family; he was greatly upset by this outcome. He resigned from the University of St. Thomas in 1970, citing depression and other emotional problems. Robert Balch and David Taylor, sociologists who studied Applewhite&#x27;s group, speculate that this departure was prompted by another affair between Applewhite and a student. The president of the university later recalled that Applewhite was often mentally jumbled and disorganized near the end of his employment.

In 1971, Applewhite briefly moved to New Mexico, where he operated a delicatessen. He was popular with customers but decided to return to Texas later that year. Applewhite&#x27;s father died around that time; the loss took a significant emotional toll on him, causing severe depression. His debts mounted, leading him to borrow money from friends.

==Introduction to Nettles and first travels==

In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an interest in Theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he felt like he had known her for a long time and concluded that they had met in a past life. Nettles told Applewhite their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology.

Applewhite soon began to live with Nettles. Although they cohabited, their relationship was not a sexual one, fulfilling his longtime wish to have a deep and loving, yet platonic, relationship. Nettles was married with four children, but after she became close with Applewhite, her husband divorced her and she lost custody of the children. Applewhite permanently broke off contact with his family as well. He saw Nettles as his soulmate, and some of his acquaintances later recalled that she had a strong influence on him. Raine writes that Nettles &quot;was responsible for reinforcing his emerging delusional beliefs&quot;, but psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton speculates that Nettles&#x27; influence helped him avoid further psychological deterioration.

Applewhite and Nettles opened a bookstore known as the Christian Arts Center, which carried books from a variety of spiritual backgrounds. They also launched a venture known as Know Place to teach classes on theosophy and mysticism. The pair closed these businesses a short time later. In February 1973, Applewhite and Nettles resolved to travel to teach others about their beliefs and drove throughout the Western U.S.; Lifton describes their travels as a &quot;restless, intense, often confused, peripatetic spiritual journey&quot;. While traveling, they had little money and occasionally resorted to selling their blood or working odd jobs for much-needed funds. The pair subsisted solely on bread rolls at times, often camped out, and sometimes did not pay their lodging bills. One of their friends from Houston corresponded with them and accepted their teachings. They visited her in May 1974, and she became their first convert.

While traveling, Applewhite and Nettles pondered the life of Francis of Assisi and read works by authors including Helena Blavatsky, R. D. Laing, and Richard Bach. They kept a King James Version of the Bible with them and studied several passages from the New Testament, focusing on teachings about Christology, asceticism, and eschatology. Applewhite also read science fiction, including works by Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke. By June 1974, Applewhite and Nettles&#x27; beliefs had solidified into a basic outline. They concluded that they had been chosen to fulfill biblical prophecies, and that they had been given higher-level minds than other people. They wrote a pamphlet that described Jesus&#x27; reincarnation as a Texan, a thinly-veiled reference to Applewhite. Furthermore, they concluded that they were the two witnesses described in the Book of Revelation and occasionally visited churches or other spiritual groups to speak of their identities, often referring to themselves as &quot;The Two&quot;, or &quot;The UFO Two&quot;. The pair believed that they would be killed and then restored to life and, in view of others, transported onto a spaceship. This event, which they referred to as &quot;the Demonstration&quot;, was to prove their claims. To their dismay, these ideas were poorly received.

==Arrest and proselytism==
In August 1974, Applewhite was arrested in Harlingen, Texas, for failing to return a car that he had rented in Missouri. He was extradited to St. Louis and jailed for six months. At the time, Applewhite maintained that he had been &quot;divinely authorized&quot; to keep the car. While jailed, he pondered theology and subsequently abandoned discussion of occult topics in favor of extraterrestrials and evolution.

After Applewhite&#x27;s release, Nettles and he resolved to contact extraterrestrials and began seeking like-minded followers. They published advertisements for meetings, where they recruited disciples, whom they called &quot;crew&quot;. At these events, they purported to represent beings from another planet, the Next Level, who sought participants for an experiment. They claimed that those who agreed to take part in the experiment would be brought to a higher evolutionary level. Nettles and Applewhite referred to themselves as &quot;Guinea&quot; and &quot;Pig&quot;. Applewhite described his role as a &quot;lab instructor&quot; and served as the primary speaker, while Nettles occasionally interjected clarifying remarks or corrections. The two seldom personally spoke with attendees, only taking phone numbers with which they could contact them. They initially named their organization the Anonymous Sexaholics Celibate Church, but it soon became known as the Human Individual Metamorphosis.

Applewhite believed in the ancient astronaut hypothesis, which claimed that extraterrestrials had visited humanity in the past and placed humans on Earth and would return to collect a select few. Parts of this teaching bear similarities to the Reformed Christian concept of election, likely owing to Applewhite&#x27;s Presbyterian upbringing.

Applewhite and Nettles sent advertisements to groups in California and were invited to speak to New Age devotees there in April 1975. At this meeting, they persuaded about half of the 50 attendees to follow them. They also focused on college campuses, speaking at Cañada College in August. At a meeting in Oregon in September 1975, they had further recruitment success—about 30 people left their homes to follow the pair, prompting interest from media outlets. The coverage was negative; commentators and some former members mocked the group and leveled accusations of brainwashing against Applewhite and Nettles. Balch and Taylor state that Applewhite and Nettles eschewed pressure tactics, seeking only devoted followers.

Benjamin E. Zeller, an academic who studies new religions, notes that Applewhite and Nettles&#x27; teachings focused on salvation through individual growth and sees this as similar to currents in the era&#x27;s New Age movement. Likewise, the importance of personal choice was also emphasized. Applewhite and Nettles denied connection with the New Age movement, viewing it as a human creation. Janja Lalich, a sociologist who studies cults, attributes their recruitment success to their eclectic mix of beliefs and the way that they deviated from typical New Age teachings: discussing literal spaceships while retaining familiar language. Most of their disciples were young and interested in occultism or otherwise lived outside of mainstream society. They came from a variety of religious backgrounds, including Eastern religions and Scientology. Most were well versed in New Age teachings, allowing Applewhite and Nettles to convert them easily. Applewhite thought that his followers would reach a higher level of being, changing like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly; this example was used in almost all of the group&#x27;s early literature. He contended that this would be a &quot;biological change into a different species, casting his teachings as scientific truth in line with secular naturalism.&quot; He emphasized to his early followers that he was not speaking metaphorically, often using the words &quot;biology&quot; and &quot;chemistry&quot; in his statements. By the mid-1970s, Applewhite attempted to avoid the use of the term &quot;religion&quot;, seeing it as inferior to science.

==Nomadic lifestyle==

By 1975, Applewhite and Nettles had taken the names &quot;Bo&quot; and &quot;Peep&quot;. They had about 70 followers and saw themselves as shepherds tending a flock. Applewhite believed that complete separation from earthly desires was a prerequisite of ascension to the Next Level and emphasized passages in the New Testament in which Jesus spoke about forsaking worldly attachments. Members were consequently instructed to renounce: friends, family, media, drugs, alcohol, jewelry, facial hair, and sexuality. Furthermore, they were at first required to adopt biblical names. Applewhite and Nettles soon told them to adopt two-syllable names that ended in &quot;ody&quot; and had three consonants in the first syllable, such as Rkkody, Jmmody, and Lvvody; Applewhite stated that these names emphasized that his followers were spiritual children. He, Nettles, and their followers lived what religious scholar James Lewis describes as a &quot;quasi-nomadic lifestyle&quot;. They usually stayed at remote campgrounds and did not speak about their beliefs. Applewhite and Nettles ceased having public meetings in April 1975, and spent little time teaching doctrine to their converts. The pair also had little contact with their dispersed followers, many of whom renounced their allegiance.

Applewhite and Nettles feared that they would be assassinated, and taught their followers that their deaths would be similar to those of the two witnesses of the Book of Revelation. Balch and Taylor believe that Applewhite&#x27;s prison experience and early rejection by audiences contributed to this fear. Applewhite and Nettles later explained to their followers that the former&#x27;s treatment by the press was a form of assassination and had fulfilled their prophecy. Applewhite took a materialistic view of the Bible, seeing it as a record of extraterrestrial contact with humanity. He drew heavily from the Book of Revelation, although he avoided traditional theological terminology and took a somewhat negative tone towards Christianity. He only lectured about a small number of verses and never tried to develop a system of theology.

By early 1976, Applewhite and Nettles had settled on the names &quot;Do&quot; and &quot;Ti&quot;; Applewhite stated that these were meaningless names. In June 1976, they gathered their remaining followers at Medicine Bow National Forest in southeastern Wyoming, promising a UFO visit. Nettles later announced that the visit had been cancelled. Applewhite and Nettles then split their followers into small groups, which they referred to as &quot;Star Clusters&quot;.

From 1976 to 1979, the group lived in campgrounds, usually in the Rocky Mountains or Texas. Applewhite and Nettles began to place greater demands on their followers&#x27; heretofore loosely structured lives, which improved membership retention. They typically communicated with their disciples in writing or through assistants. Increasingly, they emphasized that they were the only source of truth—the idea that members could receive individual revelations was rejected in an attempt to prevent schisms. Applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers, fearing that this could lead to insubordination. He and Nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as &quot;flexibility&quot;: strict obedience to their often shifting requests. The two leaders limited the group&#x27;s contacts with those outside the movement, even some who may have been interested in joining, ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties. In practice, this made their followers completely dependent upon them. Applewhite instructed his disciples to be like children or pets in their submission—their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders. Members were encouraged to constantly seek Applewhite&#x27;s advice and often ask themselves what their leaders would do when making a decision. To his followers, he did not seem dictatorial; many of them found him laid back and fatherly. In his 2000 study of the group, Winston Davis states that Applewhite mastered the &quot;fine art of religious entertainment&quot;, noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service. Applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to instill a sense of discipline in his followers; he referred to these tasks as &quot;games&quot;. He also watched science fiction television programs with the rest of the group. Rather than issue direct commands, he attempted to express his preferences and nominally offer his disciples a choice. He emphasized that students were free to disobey if they chose, in what Lalich dubs the &quot;illusion of choice&quot;.

In the late 1970s, the group received a large sum of money, possibly an inheritance of a member or donations of followers&#x27; income. This capital was used to rent houses, initially in Denver and later in Dallas. Applewhite and Nettles had about 40 followers then and lived in two or three houses; the leaders usually had their own house. The group was secretive about their lifestyle, covering their windows. Applewhite and Nettles arranged their followers&#x27; lifestyles as a boot camp that would prepare them for the Next Level. Referring to their house as a &quot;craft&quot;, they regimented the lives of their disciples down to the minute. Students who were not committed to this lifestyle were encouraged to leave; departing members were given financial assistance. Lifton states that Applewhite wanted &quot;quality over quantity&quot; in his followers, although he occasionally spoke about gaining many converts.

Applewhite and Nettles sometimes made sudden, drastic changes to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as a way that they increased their students&#x27; devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite&#x27;s approval, which he used to control them.

In 1980, Applewhite and Nettles had about 80 followers, many of whom held jobs, often working with computers or as car mechanics. In 1982, the pair allowed their disciples to call their families. They further relaxed their control in 1983, permitting their followers to visit relatives on Mother&#x27;s Day. They were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell their families that they were studying computers at a monastery. These vacations were intended to placate families by demonstrating that the disciples remained with the group of their own accord.

==Nettles&#x27; death==
In 1983, Nettles had an eye surgically removed as a result of cancer diagnosed several years earlier. While she lived for two more years, dying in 1985, Applewhite told their followers that she had &quot;traveled to the Next Level&quot; because she had &quot;too much energy to remain on Earth&quot;, abandoning her body to make the journey. His attempt to explain her death in the terms of the group&#x27;s doctrine was successful, preventing the departure of all but one member. However, Applewhite became very depressed. He claimed that Nettles still communicated with him, but he suffered from a crisis of faith. His students supported him during this time, greatly encouraging him. He then organized a ceremony in which he symbolically married his followers; Lalich views this as an attempt to ensure unity. Applewhite told his followers that he had been left behind by Nettles because he still had more to learn—he felt that she occupied &quot;a higher spiritual role&quot; than he did. He began identifying her as &quot;the Father&quot; and often referred to her with male pronouns.

Applewhite began to emphasize a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as he needed the guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured no possibility of the group&#x27;s continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ. Zeller states that the group&#x27;s previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite&#x27;s role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but in the 1980s the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.

After Nettles&#x27; death, Applewhite also altered his view of ascension; previously, he had taught that the group would physically ascend from the Earth and that death caused reincarnation, but her death—which left behind an unchanged, corporeal body—forced him to say that the ascension could be spiritual. He then concluded that her spirit had traveled to a spaceship and received a new body and that his followers and he would do the same. In his view, the Biblical heaven was actually a planet on which highly evolved beings dwelt, and physical bodies were required to ascend there. Applewhite believed that once they reached the Next Level, they would facilitate evolution on other planets. He emphasized that Jesus, whom he believed was an extraterrestrial, came to Earth, was killed, and bodily rose from the dead before being transported onto a spaceship. According to Applewhite&#x27;s doctrine, Jesus was a gateway to heaven, but had found humanity unready to ascend when he first came to the Earth. Applewhite then decided that an opportunity existed for humans to reach the Next Level &quot;every two millennia&quot;, and the early 1990s would therefore provide the first opportunity to reach the Kingdom of Heaven since the time of Jesus. Zeller notes that his beliefs were based on the Christian Bible, but were interpreted through the lens of belief in alien contact with humanity.

Applewhite taught that he was a walk-in, a concept that had gained popularity in the New Age movement during the late 1970s. Walk-ins were said to be higher beings who took control of adult bodies to teach humanity. This concept informed Applewhite&#x27;s view of resurrection; he believed that his group&#x27;s souls were to be transported to a spaceship, where they would enter other bodies. Applewhite abandoned the metaphor of a butterfly in favor of describing the body as a mere container, a vehicle that souls could enter and exit. This dualism may have been the product of the Christology that Applewhite learned as a young man; Lewis writes that the group&#x27;s teachings had &quot;Christian elements [that] were basically grafted on to a New Age matrix&quot;. In a profile of the group for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Kenneth Woodward compares his dualism to that of ancient Christian Gnosticism, although Peters notes that his theology departs from Gnosticism by privileging the physical world.

In the wake of Nettles&#x27; death, Applewhite became increasingly paranoid, fearing a conspiracy against his group. One member who joined in the mid-1980s recalled that Applewhite avoided new converts, worrying that they were infiltrators. He feared a government raid on their home and spoke highly of the Jewish defenders of Masada in ancient Israel who showed total resistance to the Roman Empire. Increasingly, he began to discuss the Apocalypse, comparing the Earth to an overgrown garden that was to be recycled or rebooted and humanity to a failed experiment. In accordance with the garden metaphor, he stated that the Earth would be &quot;spaded under&quot;. Woodward notes that Applewhite&#x27;s teaching about the Earth&#x27;s recycling is similar to the cyclical perspective of time found in Buddhism. Applewhite also used New Age concepts, but he differed from that movement by predicting that apocalyptic, rather than utopian, changes would soon occur on Earth. He contended that most humans had been brainwashed by Lucifer but that his followers could break free of this control. He specifically cited sexual urges as the work of Lucifer. In addition, he stated that evil extraterrestrials, whom he referred to as &quot;Luciferians&quot;, sought to thwart his mission. He argued that many prominent moral teachers and advocates of political correctness were actually Luciferians. This theme emerged in 1988, possibly in response to the lurid alien abduction stories that were proliferating at the time.

==Obscurity and evangelism==
In the late 1980s, the group kept a low profile; few people knew it still existed. In 1988, they mailed a document that detailed their beliefs to a variety of New Age organizations. The mailing contained information about their history and advised people to read several books, which primarily focused on Christian history and UFOs. With the exception of the 1988 document, Applewhite&#x27;s group remained inconspicuous until 1992, when they recorded a 12-part video series which was broadcast via satellite. This series echoed many of the teachings of the 1988 update, although it introduced a &quot;universal mind&quot; of which its hearers could partake.

Over the course of the group&#x27;s existence, several hundred people joined and left. In the early 1990s, their membership dwindled, numbering as few as 26; these defections gave Applewhite a sense of urgency. In May 1993, the group took the name &quot;Total Overcomers Anonymous&quot;. They then spent $30,000 to publish a full-page advertisement in &quot;USA Today&quot; that warned of catastrophic judgment to befall the Earth. Its publication led about 20 former members to rejoin the group. This, along with a series of public lectures in 1994, caused membership to double from its nadir at the beginning of the decade. By this time, Applewhite did not regiment his disciples&#x27; lives as strictly as he had and spent less time with them.

In the early 1990s, Applewhite posted some of his teachings on the Internet, but he was stung by the resulting criticism. That year, he first spoke of the possibility of suicide as a way to reach the Next Level. He explained that everything &quot;human&quot; had to be forsaken, including the human body, before one could ascend. The organization was then renamed Heaven&#x27;s Gate. Davis speculates that this rejection may have encouraged him to attempt to leave Earth.

From June to October 1995, the group lived in a rural part of New Mexico. They purchased and built a compound—which they referred to as the &quot;Earth ship&quot;—using tires and lumber; Applewhite hoped to establish a monastery. This proved to be a difficult endeavor, particularly for the aging Applewhite: he was in poor health and, at one point, feared that he had cancer. Lifton notes that Applewhite&#x27;s active leadership of the group probably led to severe fatigue in his last years. The winter was very cold, and they abandoned the plan. Afterwards, they lived in several houses in the San Diego area.

The group increasingly focused on the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for surgical castration. They initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon, but eventually found one in Mexico. In Applewhite&#x27;s view, sexuality was one of the most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no reproductive organs, but that Luciferian beings had genders. He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven. In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a nonsexual family.

==Mass suicide==

In October 1996, the group rented a mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, California. That year, they recorded two video messages in which they offered their viewers a &quot;last chance to evacuate Earth&quot;. Around the same time, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp. Applewhite now believed that Nettles was aboard a spaceship trailing the comet, and that she planned to rendezvous with them. He told his followers that the vessel would transport them to an empyrean destination, and that a government conspiracy was attempting to suppress word of the craft. In addition, he stated that his deceased followers would be taken by the vessel, as well, a belief that resembled the Christian pretribulation rapture doctrine. How he learned of the comet or why he believed that it was accompanied by extraterrestrials or why he should have believed the dead Nettles would be with them is not known.

In late March 1997, the group isolated themselves and recorded farewell statements. Many members praised Applewhite in their final messages; Davis describes their remarks as &quot;regurgitations of Do&#x27;s gospel&quot;. Applewhite recorded a video shortly before his death, in which he termed the suicides the &quot;final exit&quot; of the group and remarked, &quot;We do in all honesty hate this world&quot;. Lewis speculates that Applewhite settled on suicide because he had said that the group would ascend during his lifetime, so appointing a successor was unfeasible.

Religious scholar Catherine Wessinger posits that the suicides began on March 22. Most members took barbiturates and alcohol and then placed bags over their heads. They wore Nike shoes and black uniforms with patches that read &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate Away Team&quot;. A bag that contained a few dollars and a form of identification was placed beside most bodies. The deaths occurred over three days; Applewhite was one of the last four to die. Three assistants helped him commit suicide, then killed themselves. An anonymous tip led the sheriff&#x27;s department to search the mansion; they found 39 bodies there on March 26. It was the largest group suicide involving U.S. citizens since the 1978 mass suicide of 913 Americans in Jonestown, Guyana. Applewhite&#x27;s body was found seated on the bed of the mansion&#x27;s master bedroom. Medical examiners determined that his fears of cancer had been unfounded, but that he suffered from coronary atherosclerosis.

The deaths provoked a media circus, and Applewhite&#x27;s face was featured on the covers of &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; on April 7. His final message was widely broadcast; Hugh Urban of Ohio State University described his appearance in the video as &quot;wild-eyed [and] rather alarming&quot;.

==Analysis==
Although many popular commentators, including psychologist Margaret Singer, speculate that Applewhite brainwashed his followers, many academics have rejected the &quot;brainwashing&quot; label as an oversimplification that does not express the nuances of the process by which the followers were influenced. Lalich speculates that they were willing to follow Applewhite in suicide because they had become totally dependent upon him, hence were poorly suited for life in his absence. Davis attributes Applewhite&#x27;s success in convincing his followers to commit suicide to two factors: He isolated them socially and cultivated an attitude of complete religious obedience in them. Applewhite&#x27;s students had made a long-term commitment to him, and Balch and Taylor infer that this is why his interpretations of events appeared coherent to them. Most of the dead had been members for about 20 years, although there were a few recent converts.

Lewis argues that Applewhite effectively controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing that members of the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw it as a way to demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.

Urban writes that Applewhite&#x27;s life displays &quot;the intense ambivalence and alienation shared by many individuals lost in late 20th-century capitalist society&quot;. He notes that Applewhite&#x27;s condemnations of contemporary culture bear similarities to those of Jean Baudrillard at times, particularly their shared nihilist views. Urban posits that Applewhite found no way other than suicide to escape the society that surrounded him and states that death offered him a way to escape its &quot;endless circle of seduction and consumption&quot;.

While covering the suicides, several media outlets focused on Applewhite&#x27;s sexuality; the &quot;New York Post&quot; dubbed him &quot;the Gay Guru&quot;. Gay rights activist Troy Perry argued that Applewhite&#x27;s repression, and society&#x27;s rejection, of same-sex relationships ultimately led to his suicide. This idea has failed to gain support among academics. Zeller argues that Applewhite&#x27;s sexuality was not the primary driving force behind his asceticism, which he believes resulted from a variety of factors, though he grants sexuality a role.

Lalich states that Applewhite fit &quot;the traditional view of a charismatic leader&quot;, and Evan Thomas deems him a &quot;master manipulator&quot;. Lifton compares Applewhite to Shoko Asahara, the founder of Aum Shinrikyo, describing him as &quot;equally controlling, his paranoia and megalomania gentler yet ever present&quot;. Christopher Partridge of Lancaster University states that Applewhite and Nettles were similar to John Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton, who founded Muggletonianism, a millennialist movement in 17th century England.

<text>The following is a list of cities and largest towns in Myanmar with populations above 5,000, according to UNFPA Myanmar. The capitals of states and regions in Myanmar are bolded. In Myanmar, the definition of a city is ambiguous with the Burmese term (&#x27;myo&#x27;) being translated as any urban area. The General Administration Department only explicitly defines the three cities of Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyidaw.

<doc id="379361" wikidata="Q490348" url="?curid=379361" title="Later Jin invasion of Joseon">
<text>The Later Jin invasion of Joseon occurred in early 1627 when the Later Jin prince Amin led an invasion of the Joseon dynasty. The war ended after three months with the Later Jin establishing itself as sovereign tributary overlord over Joseon. However Joseon continued its relationship with the Ming dynasty and showed defiance in solidifying its tributary relationship with the Later Jin. It was followed by the Qing invasion of Joseon in 1636.

==Background==

The kingdom of Joseon had previously sent 10,069 musketeers and 3,000 archers to aid the Ming dynasty in attacking the Later Jin in 1619, which culminated in an allied defeat at the Battle of Sarhū. The Joseon general Gang Hong-rip surrendered with his remaining forces and insisted that Joseon did not hold anything against the Jurchens, having only sent reinforcements to repay an obligation to Ming.

In 1623, a faction at the Joseon court known as the Westerners deposed King Gwanghaegun (Hangul: 광해군, Hanja: 光海君) and installed Injo as king. The following year Yi Gwal rebelled against King Injo, but failed in ousting him, and the rebellion was crushed. Its survivors fled to the Jin court where they recommended Hong Taiji to invade Joseon. General Gang Hong-rip was also led to believe by the survivors that his family had died in the coup, so he pushed for the invasion out of a desire for revenge.

Meanwhile the Westerners took on an explicitly pro-Ming and anti-Jurchen stance in their relations with the two states. Injo severed relations with the Later Jin on the advice of his advisers. The Ming general Mao Wenlong&#x27;s army of 26,000 men engaged in raids against the Jurchens from an island base off the Korean peninsula. The Westerners aided him by allowing him to station his troops in Uiju.

The Later Jin had lost at the Battle of Ningyuan the previous year and their Khan, Nurhaci, died from his wounds afterwards. Peace negotiations with the Ming after the battle delayed an aggressive Ming response to the Jurchen loss, and the Ming general Yuan Chonghuan was busy fortifying the border garrisons and training new musketeers. The new Khan, Hong Taiji, was eager for a quick victory to consolidate his position. By invading Joseon he also hoped to extract much needed resources for his army and subjects, who had suffered in the war against Ming.

==War==

In 1627, Hong Taiji dispatched Amin, Jirgalang, Ajige and Yoto to Joseon with 30,000 troops under the guidance of Gang Hong-rip and Li Yongfang. The Jurchens met sharp resistance at the border towns but Joseon border garrisons were quickly defeated. On 14 January, the Jurchen army advanced into Uiju where Mao Wenlong was stationed, and Mao quickly fled with his men into the Bohai Sea. The Neunghan Fortress fell on the 21 January. Next the Jurchens attacked Anju. When it became clear that defeat was inevitable, the Anju garrisons committed suicide by blowing up their gunpowder storehouse. Pyongyang fell without a fight and the Jin army crossed the Taedong River.

By this time, news of the invasion had reached the Ming court, which immediately dispatched a relief contingent to Joseon, slowing the Jurchen advance into Hwangju.

King Injo then dispatched an envoy to negotiate a peace treaty, but by the time the messenger returned, Injo had already fled from Hanseong (Seoul) to Ganghwa Island in panic.

Despite the Jin invasion&#x27;s success, Amin was willing to negotiate a peace. The following settlement was agreed upon on Ganghwa Island:

#Joseon abandons the Ming era name Tianqi (天啓).
#Joseon offers Yi Gak as a hostage as a substitute for a royal prince.
#(Later) Jin and Joseon will not violate each other&#x27;s territory.

While negotiations were taking place, the city of Pyongyang underwent several days of looting by the Jurchens before Amin was ordered by Hong Taji to sign the peace agreement. The Jin army then withdrew to Mukden, ending the three-month-long invasion.

==Aftermath==

In the postwar negotiations, the Later Jin forced Joseon to open markets near the borders because its conflicts with Ming had brought economic hardship and starvation to Jin subjects. Joseon was also forced to transfer suzerainty of the Warka tribe to Jin. Furthermore, a tribute of 100 horses, 100 tiger and leopard skins, 400 bolts of cotton, and 15,000 pieces of cloth was to be extracted and gifted to the Jin Khan. Injo&#x27;s brother was sent to deliver this tribute. However in later letters to the Joseon king, Hong Taiji would complain that the Koreans did not behave as if they had lost, and were not abiding by the terms of the agreement. Joseon merchants and markets continued to trade with Ming and actively aided Ming subjects by providing them with grain and rations. Hong Taiji rebuked them, saying that the food of Joseon should only be fed to Joseon subjects.

The relationship between Joseon and Later Jin remained uncomfortable and bleak. The invasion was bitterly resented by Joseon&#x27;s statesmen and Confucian scholars, who believed that it was treacherous and unfilial for Joseon to abandon Ming considering the assistance it had provided against Japan in the past. This resentment was inflamed in 1636 when the Manchus demanded changing the terms of diplomatic relationship from equality to sovereign-vassal. The Joseon court, dominated by anti-Manchu hawks, rejected the demand. This led to the Qing invasion of Joseon in 1636.

The Ming general Yuan Chonghuan was impeached for having been duped by the Jin into entering peace negotiations, and court officials accused him of lack of agency. This was the last time Ming would openly engage in peace negotiations with the Jurchens.

Mao Wenlong was reported to Ming authorities by Joseon for cowardice and treachery. Mao began acting independently and minted his own coins in 1628, while conducting illicit trading in contravention of Ming law. He was caught by Yuan Chonghuan in 1629 and executed for smuggling on 24 July 1629. Yuan reported the death of Mao Wenlong to the Joseon court, stating that it had been done to &quot;properly establish the emperor&#x27;s awesomeness.&quot; Prior to his execution, Yuan Chonghuan addressed him thus:

<text>AS-201 (Also known as SA-201, Apollo 1-A, or Apollo 1 prior to the 1967 pad fire), flown February 26, 1966, was the first uncrewed test flight of an entire production Block I Apollo command and service module and the Saturn IB launch vehicle. The spacecraft consisted of the second Block I command module and the first Block I service module. The suborbital flight was a partially successful demonstration of the service propulsion system and the reaction control systems of both modules, and successfully demonstrated the capability of the command module&#x27;s heat shield to survive re-entry from low Earth orbit.

==Vehicle configuration==

===Spacecraft===

The command and service module CSM-009 was a Block I version, designed before the lunar orbit rendezvous method was chosen for the Apollo lunar landing; therefore it lacked capability to dock with a lunar module. Block I also employed preliminary designs of certain subsystems, and was heavier than the Block II version with lunar mission capability. All previous command and service modules flown (with one exception) were boilerplate versions.

CM-009 was the second production Block I command module to fly, the first being CM-002 flown on a Little Joe II rocket for the final launch escape system abort test, designated A-004. CM-009 varied from the production configuration by the omission of the guidance and navigation system; crew couches, displays, and associated equipment; and by the addition of a control programmer and open-loop emergency detection system.

SM-009 was the first production Block I service module to fly. It varied from the production configuration by replacement of the electrical power-generating fuel cells with batteries, and omission of the S-band communication equipment.

The launch also included a Block I launch escape system (LES), and the first flight of the Spacecraft–LM adapter (SLA) which connected the spacecraft to the launch vehicle.

===Launch vehicle===

The Saturn IB was the uprated version of the Saturn I rocket flown in ten earlier Apollo missions. It featured an upgrade of the first stage engines to increase total thrust from of thrust to , and replacement of the second stage with the S-IVB. This stage used a new liquid hydrogen-burning J-2 engine which would also be used on the S-II second stage of the Saturn V lunar launch vehicle. A modified version of the S-IVB, with an in-space restartable J-2, would also be used as the third stage of the Saturn V. It also used a new model of the guidance and control system known as the Instrument Unit, which would also be used on the Saturn V.

==Objectives==
The objectives of the mission were to:
* Demonstrate the Saturn IB launch vehicle propulsion, guidance and electrical systems
* Demonstrate structural compatibility between the launch vehicle and CSM, ensuring the spacecraft&#x27;s design loads weren&#x27;t exceeded
* Demonstrate appropriate separation of all vehicle elements
* Demonstrate the CSM&#x27;s heat shield, service propulsion system (including in-space restart), CM and SM reaction control systems, environmental control of cabin pressure and temperature, partial communications, stability and control, Earth landing system, and electrical power subsystem.
* Evaluate the Emergency Detection System in an open-loop configuration
* Demonstrate the CM heat shield ablator at a 200 BTU/ft2/sec heat transfer rate
* Demonstrate support facilities for launch, mission control, and recovery

The mission profile called for the Saturn IB to launch the spacecraft on an east-by-southeast heading into a high ballistic trajectory; then the CSM would separate from the SLA. The service module engine would be fired twice, then the command module would re-enter and land in the south Atlantic Ocean.

==Preparation for flight==
The first piece of the rocket to arrive at the Cape was the S-IB stage on August 14, 1965, by the barge &quot;Promise&quot;. It was built by Chrysler and featured eight H-1 engines built by Rocketdyne. The S-IVB second stage arrived next on September 18. The Instrument Unit that would control the launch vehicle arrived October 22, the command module arrived three days later and the service module on October 27.

The first stage was erected at the pad soon after arriving at Cape Kennedy. The second stage joined it on October 1. After fixing some problems in the Instrument Unit it was mated to the S-IVB on October 25. The CSM was mated on December 26.

The first problem encountered by NASA came on October 7. The RCA 110A computer which would test the rocket and thus, automating the process, was ten days behind schedule meaning that it would not be at the Cape before November 1. This meant that by the middle of October little could be done at the pad. When the computer finally did arrive it continued to have problems with the punch cards and also the capacitors that did not operate well under a protective coating. In the end however the testing of the launch vehicle was still on schedule.

Testing was running around the clock during December. Technicians were testing the CSM&#x27;s fuel systems during the day and the testing was running on the rocket at night.

There was even an instance of a variant of the Y2K bug in the computer. As it ran past midnight, when the time changed from 2400 to 0001 the computer could not handle it and &quot;turned into a pumpkin&quot; according to an interview with Frank Bryan, a Kennedy Space Center Launch Vehicle Operations Engineering staff member.

In the end the testing regimen slowly completed and the plugs-out tests were completed proving that the rocket could function by itself.

==Flight==

===Launch attempt===
The first launch attempt was scheduled for February 26, 1966. There were several small delays, but when the pressure in one of the fuel tanks in the S-IVB fell below the allowed limits, the onboard computer aborted the launch four seconds before launch.

Though the problem could be fixed easily, it was thought that it could not be done within the launch window. After running a simulated launch and 150 seconds of flight to show that the rocket could operate with the lower pressure in the fuel tank, the launch was reinstated.

===Flight===
Finally, after months of delays and problems, the first flight of the Saturn IB lifted off from Pad 34. The first stage worked perfectly, lifting the rocket to , when the S-IVB took over and lifted the spacecraft to . The CSM separated and continued upwards to .

The CSM then fired its own rocket to accelerate the spacecraft towards Earth. The first burn lasted for 184 seconds. It then fired later for ten seconds. This proved that the engine could restart in space, a crucial part of any crewed flight to the Moon.

It entered the atmosphere traveling . It splashed down 37 minutes after launch, from the planned touch down point, and was on board the aircraft carrier two hours later.

==Problems==

There were three problems encountered on the flight. The service module engine worked properly for only 80 seconds, interrupted by the presence of helium pressurant gas in the combustion chamber. Helium was used to pressurize the fuel tanks but should not have been in the combustion chamber. This was caused by a break in an oxidizer line that allowed helium to mix with the oxidizer.

The second problem was an electrical system failure which caused the command module to lose steering control during reentry. Last, measurements that were intended to be taken during reentry, failed due to a short circuit. Both of these problems were found to be due to incorrect wiring, and were easily fixed.

==Capsule location==
After the flight the capsule was also used for drop tests at White Sands Missile Range. It is now on display at the Strategic Air and Space Museum, Ashland, Nebraska.

<text>The Mount Washington Cog Railway, also known as the Cog, is the world&#x27;s first mountain-climbing cog railway (rack-and-pinion railway). The railway climbs Mount Washington in New Hampshire, United States. It uses a Marsh rack system and both steam and biodiesel-powered locomotives to carry tourists to the top of the mountain. Its track is built to a gauge, which is technically a narrow gauge, as it is less than a .

It is the second-steepest rack railway in the world, after the Pilatus Railway in Switzerland, with an average grade of over 25% and a maximum grade of 37%. The railway is approximately long and ascends Mount Washington&#x27;s western slope, beginning at an elevation of approximately above sea level and ending just short of the mountain&#x27;s summit peak of . The train ascends the mountain at and descends at . Steam locomotives take approximately 65 minutes to ascend and 40 minutes to descend, while the biodiesel engines can go up in as little as 36 minutes.

Most of the Mount Washington Cog Railway is in Thompson and Meserve&#x27;s Purchase, with the part of the railway nearest to Mount Washington&#x27;s summit being in Sargent&#x27;s Purchase.

==History==
The railway was built by Sylvester Marsh who grew up in Campton. Marsh came up with the idea while climbing the mountain in 1852. His plan was treated as insane. Local tradition says that the state legislature voted permission based on a consensus that harm resulting from operating it was no issue – since the design was attempting the impossible – but benefits were guaranteed. He was putting up $5,000 of his own money, and that, plus whatever else he could raise, would be spent locally, including building the Fabyan House hotel at nearby Fabyan Station to accommodate the expected tourists. The railway is sometimes called &quot;Railway to the Moon&quot;, because one state legislator remarked during the proceedings that Marsh should be given a charter, not merely up Mount Washington, but also to the moon.

Marsh obtained a charter for the road on June 25, 1858, but the American Civil War prevented any action until May 1866. He developed a prototype locomotive and a short demonstration section of track, then found investors, forming the Mount Washington Railway Company in the spring of 1866, and started construction. The route closely followed a mountain trail that had been established earlier in the century by Ethan Allen Crawford.

Despite the railroad&#x27;s incomplete state, the first paying customers started riding on August 14, 1868, and the construction reached the summit in July 1869. The early locomotives – represented today by the restored display locomotive, #1 &quot;Old Peppersass&quot; – all had vertical boilers, like many stationary steam engines of the time; the boilers were mounted to the locomotives&#x27; frames with twin trunnions, allowing them to pivot as the locomotive and coach climbed the grade, permitting gravity to always keep the boiler vertically oriented, no matter what the gradient of the track. Later designs introduced horizontal boilers, slanted so that they remain close to horizontal on the steeply graded track.

In August 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant visited New England to escape the heat of summer in Washington, D.C. During his tour he rode the cog railway to the top of Mount Washington.

===Running the railway===
The Cog has been in continuous operation since 1869, with service interruptions only during the World Wars.

After Marsh died in 1884, control of the Cog passed to the Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad, which ran it until 1889 when the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad took over. From 1868 to 1910, the locomotives were fired with wood. In 1910, the railway converted to using coal for all its locomotives.

Henry N. Teague, a hotel executive, bought the Cog in 1931. Known as Col. Teague, an honorary title, he died in October 1951. Operational control passed to Arthur S. Teague, who had become vice president and general manager of the railway prior to his service in World War II, while ownership passed to Dartmouth College, Henry N. Teague&#x27;s alma mater. The younger Teague, who actually was a colonel and was highly decorated during his military service, was a protégé of the elder Teague, but the two were not related. Arthur S. Teague bought the railway from Dartmouth in 1962. After he died in 1967, ownership of the railway passed to his wife, Ellen Crawford Teague, who ran the Cog as the world&#x27;s first woman president of a railway. In 1983, Mrs. Teague sold the railway to a group of New Hampshire businessmen.

From 1986 to 2017, the Cog Railway was controlled and owned by Wayne Presby and Joel Bedor of Littleton, New Hampshire. The Bedor and Presby families also owned the Mount Washington Hotel and Resort in Bretton Woods for the period 1991–2006. In 1995, the railway appointed Charles Kenison as general manager. These individuals were responsible for a complete revitalization of the railroad, with the assistance of Al LaPrade, a mechanical engineer whose career began at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.

In the summer of 2008, the Cog introduced its first diesel locomotive. The Great Recession and the 2000s energy crisis led to fewer passengers, and the Cog sought to cut costs with the diesel, which could make three round trips for the cost of one steam train round trip.

In December 2016, the owner of the Cog proposed building a 35-room hotel along the line, about below the summit and above the station, to be opened in 2019 for the 150th anniversary of the train. However, the proposal drew opposition due to its location in the alpine zone of the mountain and was shelved.

In April 2017, the Bedor family sold its interest in the railway to Wayne Presby, the only remaining member of the original group, which had purchased the railway in 1983. Presby assumed direct management control of the railway in December 2017. In 2021, the railway completed two of the largest improvement projects in its history. The existing rail was replaced with rail and a new maintenance facility was completed. The new facility enabled the railway to resume winter operations in 2020. During the winter, the railway operates its trains to Waumbek Station at an elevation of approximately .

===&quot;Devil&#x27;s shingle&quot; slideboards===

In the early days of the railway&#x27;s construction, the workers wanted to minimize time when climbing and descending the ramp, so they invented slideboards fitting over the cog rack and providing enough room for themselves and their tools. These boards – no two were exactly alike – were approximately long by wide, made of wood with hand-forged iron and with two long, hardwood handles usually attached at the down-mountain end. The average time for the descent of the mountain using these boards was about 15 minutes. The record was 2:45, an average speed above .

The &quot;Devil&#x27;s shingles&quot; were banned in 1908 after the accidental death of an employee. However, that did not stop workers, and there are sources claiming the shingles were used by some up until the 1920s. Later, the design of the rack was changed so that the old braking mechanism could no longer grip.

===Accidents===
The railway has taken more than five million people to the summit during its existence. There have been two incidents resulting in fatalities, noted below.

The first major accident occurred on July 20, 1929, involving locomotive no.1, known as &quot;Old Peppersass&quot;. This locomotive was used to build the railway, and operated until retirement in 1878. After a few years on display locally, it was shipped to the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) took possession of the locomotive after the Exposition, and stored it in Baltimore until the 1927 Fair of the Iron Horse celebrating the B&amp;O&#x27;s 100th birthday. The Boston &amp; Maine Railroad restored &quot;Old Peppersass&quot; at its Concord shops following the Fair to make a commemorative trip for the railway&#x27;s 60th anniversary. After ascending to Jacob&#x27;s Ladder, the locomotive began a planned descent but jumped up and landed to the right of the cog rail when a tooth broke from a gear wheel. The friction brake was unable to prevent the locomotive from accelerating downhill. The crew jumped to safety (though some suffered broken bones), but a photographer riding the engine to take publicity photos, Daniel P. Rossiter, fell to his death as the engine plunged off the trestle. The locomotive broke into pieces, but the boiler did not rupture, and the pieces were later reassembled to reconstruct the locomotive for static display. It is now located at the railway&#x27;s base station.

On September 17, 1967, eight passengers were killed and 72 injured when locomotive no.3 derailed at the Skyline switch, about a mile below the summit. The engine rolled off the trestle while the uncoupled passenger car slid several hundred feet into a large rock. An investigation revealed that the Skyline switch had not been properly configured for the descending train. A brakeman now watches for safety hazards from the leading end platform of the passenger car.

A non-fatal incident on August 10, 1946, injured 22 people. A flatcar, initially at rest near the summit, sped down the track and collided with an ascending passenger train carrying 24 people.

==Mechanical design==
The cog railway designs and builds all of its locomotives and passenger coaches at the company shops located at the base of Mount Washington.

Each train consists of a locomotive pushing a single passenger car up the mountain, descending the mountain by going in reverse. Both locomotive and car were originally equipped with a ratchet and pawl mechanism engaged during the climb that prevents any roll-back; during descent, both locomotive and car are braked. Design improvements have replaced the ratchet (gear and pawl mechanism) with sprag clutches and disc brake assemblies. Most of the locomotives were made by the Manchester Locomotive Works.
The rack rail design used is one of Marsh&#x27;s own inventions, using a ladder-like rack with open bar rungs engaged by the teeth of the cog wheel. This system allows snow and debris to fall through the rack, rather than lodging in it. A similar design, called the Riggenbach rack system, was invented by engineer Niklaus Riggenbach in Switzerland at about the same time. The Swiss Consul to the United States visited Marsh while constructing the railway up Mount Washington, and his enthusiastic reports persuaded the Swiss government to commission Riggenbach to build the Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn on Mount Rigi, which opened on May 21, 1871.

Initially, there was no way for two trains to pass one another on the Mount Washington Cog Railway. In 1941, a nine-motion switch was invented, and two spur sidings were added, each long enough to divert two descending trains so that climbing trains could continue to the summit, enabling more round trips per day.
In 2004, work was completed replacing the lower Waumbek Switch and Siding with an passing loop equipped with electric and hydraulically powered automated switches. These switches are powered by batteries and recharged by solar panels. One switch is located at each end of the loop, allowing ascending and descending trains to pass one another.

In 2008, work began on the first diesel locomotive to be powered with biodiesel, with the assistance of a retired mechanical engineer from the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. By 2019, the railway completed the construction of seven of these locomotives.

In 2014, work began on another switch and siding at the summit of Mount Washington, to allow trains to pass one another at the summit of the mountain.

==Modern operations==
The most common trips on the Cog Railway are between the two main stations, one at the summit and the other adjacent to the operators&#x27; logistical and repair base.

From 2003 to 2006, &quot;ski trains&quot; ran, stopping at an intermediate station, from which passengers could ski down to the Base Station.

The Cog Railway track crosses over three hiking trails, including the Gulfside Trail, which is part of the Appalachian Trail. Some hikers have been known to wait for the next train in order to expose their buttocks to the passengers, a practice known as &quot;Mooning the Cog.&quot; Several hikers were arrested for performing this act in 2007. The railway was in operation before these trails existed and they cross railroad property.
Access to the base station by car is by three routes, each culminating with the upper portion of the dead-end Cog Base Road. The advertised, roughly eastbound route uses the Base Road&#x27;s full length from Bretton Woods. An especially scenic route, initially southbound from U.S. Route 2, follows Jefferson Notch Road, a narrow dirt road with hairpin turns; it rises to the pass, at above sea level, between Mount Jefferson in the Presidential Range and Mount Dartmouth, before descending to its junction with the Base Road. The Jefferson Notch Road is closed to wheeled vehicles in winterand usually before and afterand used primarily by snowmobiles. The roughly northbound route from U.S. Route 302 in Crawford Notch via Mt. Clinton Road is also closed in the winter to vehicular traffic. Operations of trains all winter began in 2004–2005, and the Cog Base Road is plowed and sanded all winter to allow tourists, skiers, and employees access to the Base Station.

==Environmental concerns==
The steam locomotives on the railway generate large amounts of smoke, nicknamed &quot;Cog Smog&quot;. The railway is exempted from the state&#x27;s air-pollution-control law (RSA 125-C:20), which exempts &quot;any steam locomotives and engines or replacements thereof used in connection with the operation of a railroad or railway which were in operation or on order prior to January 1, 1973, and are located entirely within the state.&quot;

Each steam locomotive ride burns of coal and consumes of water.

One steam locomotive was converted to oil-firing in 2008. The attempt to oil-fire the existing steam locomotives failed, and in 2008 the railway introduced its first diesel locomotive, designed and built by the railroad staff. Since 2008, four more diesels were completed (M-2 and M-3 in 2009, M-4 in 2011, and M-5 in 2013). All the new diesel hydraulic locomotives are operated on B20 (20% biodiesel blend) during the summer season. The company stated that the primary reason the new diesels were built was to reduce the visual pollution caused by the coal-fired steam locomotives, to lower emissions, and to increase the length of time that passengers could spend at the summit of Mount Washington.

Each diesel locomotive ride burns approximately of B20 (20% biodiesel blend) fuel.

The locomotives push passenger cars that have a capacity of 70 riders. The Cog Railway also rosters eight wooden coaches.

<doc id="379377" wikidata="Q613363" url="?curid=379377" title="List of municipalities in Thailand">
<text>Thailand divides its settlements (&quot;thesaban&quot;) into three categories by size: city municipalities (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;), towns (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) and townships (or subdistrict municipality) (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). There are 33 city municipalities as of November 2024.

The national capital Bangkok and the special governed city Pattaya fall outside these divisions. They are &quot;self-governing districts&quot;.

Due to the outdated nature of the &quot;thesaban&quot; system, any city municipality&#x27;s growth subsequent to its settlement designation is not included in both area and population numbers. For this reason, the Department of Public Works and Town &amp; Country Planning, and each province&#x27;s Provincial Administrative Organization regularly revise and publish up-to-date city boundaries () to reflect population growth. These revisions are royally decreed and published in the &quot;Royal Thai Government Gazette&quot;. The term เขตเมือง/&quot;khet mueang&quot; can also be translated to the term urban area, a widely used term to describe and designate large cities.

Most Thai cities&#x27; revised boundaries are contained in the province&#x27;s capital district, known as Amphoe Mueang. Chiang Mai is the only city outside Bangkok to cover multiple districts in its urban area. Together, Bangkok and Chiang Mai are the only cities in Thailand with a population of over one million.

Thailand has an urbanization rate of 52% (2021), translating to 36,217,020 people of the total population. This rate is based on the &quot;thesaban&quot; system, meaning that 8,442,107 people live in city municipalities, 4,437,112 people live in town municipalities and 23,337,801 people live in townships (subdistrict municipalities). According to the &quot;khet mueang&quot; system, 21,838,418 people (31.35% of total population) live in urban areas with a population greater than 150,000.

Several agencies issue population figures. Locally registered Thai populations are compiled by the Department of Local Administration (DLA). These figures are labeled as &quot;Locally Registered Thai Population&quot; and reflect the migrant, upcountry, and seasonal nature of Thai labor flows to the capital and tourist hot spots, yet maintain upcountry registration. Figures are very different from those by the National Statistics Office (NSO), which conducts the decennial census by attempting to count the total resident Thai population plus under 1,000 permanent resident foreigners. The result by the NSO is labeled as &quot;Total Thai Population&quot;. Neither of the two offices release municipal level figures that include non-permanent residents, long-stay expatriates and figures for contracted foreign ASEAN migrants (a significant labor segment in cities like Bangkok, Pattaya, Chiang Mai, and Phuket, totaling two to three million workers), though this inclusion is being increasingly regularized since 2014. The NSO did release projected figures including regularized ASEAN migrants, i.e., &quot;total resident population&quot; down to the provincial level for 2017.

==City municipalities==

The table below lists Department of Local Administration (DLA) (local registered Thai) 2020 figures. For the NSO compiled total Thai resident decennial census municipal counts view here..

In most cases, municipal population numbers do not represent the current size of each individual city, but only the administrative core. Geographically limited city municipalities such as Koh Samui and the suburban city municipalities of Bangkok, namely Nonthaburi, Pak Kret, Samut Prakan, Nakhon Pathom, and Samut Sakhon, are the exception. Bangkok&#x27;s suburban areas are inside the Bangkok Metropolitan Region and therefore do not have their own urban or metropolitan area.


== Largest cities by urban population ==
The following table lists the ten largest cities in Thailand by urban population, based on Department of Local Administration (DLA) figures. These figures represent the current size of each city, accounting for areal and population growth subsequent to each city&#x27;s original city municipality designation.

Bangkok and Chiang Mai are the only cities covering multiple districts (known as &quot;Khet&quot; for Bangkok and &quot;Amphoe&quot; for the provinces), and the only two cities with a population of over one million. Although Pattaya is a &quot;self-governing district&quot; (located inside, but not part of Bang Lamung district), it has grown into all neighboring sub-districts and accounts for the largest population percentage, making it de facto a part of the &quot;Pattaya-Bang Lamung-Jomtien&quot; area. Chiang Mai is the only provincial city whose city boundaries () cover districts adjacent to the Amphoe Mueang district (Capital district).
