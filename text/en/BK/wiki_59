<text>Aircraft engine controls provide a means for the pilot to control and monitor the operation of the aircraft&#x27;s powerplant. This article describes controls used with a basic internal-combustion engine driving a propeller. Some optional or more advanced configurations are described at the end of the article. Jet turbine engines use different operating principles and have their own sets of controls and sensors.

==Basic controls and indicators==
*Throttle control - Sets the desired power level normally by a lever in the cockpit. In carburetted engines the lever is called &quot;throttle lever&quot; and controls the mass flow rate of the air-fuel mixture delivered to the cylinders by the amount of throttle valve opening. In engines with fuel injection system, the lever is typically referred to as &quot;power lever&quot; and controls the amount of fuel that is injected into the cylinders.
*Propeller control or Governor - Adjusts the propeller blade pitch and regulates the engine load as necessary to maintain the set revolutions per minute (RPM). See the section on propeller below for details.
*Mixture control - Sets the amount of fuel added to the intake airflow. At higher altitudes, the air pressure (and therefore the oxygen level) declines so the fuel volume must also be reduced to give the correct air–fuel mixture. This process is known as &quot;leaning&quot;.
*Master switch - Most often actually two separate switches, the &quot;battery master&quot; and the &quot;alternator master&quot;. The &quot;battery master&quot; activates a relay (sometimes called the battery contactor) which connects the battery to the aircraft&#x27;s main electrical bus. The &quot;alternator master&quot; activates the alternator by applying power to the alternator field circuit. These two switches provide electrical power to all the systems in the aircraft.
*Ignition switch - Activates the magnetos by opening the grounding or &#x27;p-lead&#x27; circuit; with the p-lead ungrounded the magneto is free to send its high-voltage output to the spark plugs. In most aircraft the ignition switch also applies power to the starter motor during engine start. In piston aircraft engines, the battery does not generate the spark for combustion. This is accomplished using devices called magnetos. Magnetos are connected to the engine by gearing. When the crankshaft turns, it turns the magnetos which mechanically generate voltage for spark. In the event of an electrical failure, the engine will continue to run. The Ignition Switch has the following positions:
*#&quot;Off&quot; - Both magneto p-leads are connected to electrical ground. This disables both magnetos, no spark is produced.
*#&quot;Right&quot; - The left magneto p-lead is grounded, and the right is open. This disables the left magneto and enables the right magneto only.
*#&quot;Left&quot; - The right magneto p-lead is grounded, and the left is open. This disables the right magneto and enables the left magneto only.
*#&quot;Both&quot; - This is the normal operating configuration, both p-leads are open, enabling both magnetos.
*#&quot;Start&quot; - The pinion gear on the starter motor is engaged with the flywheel and the starter motor runs to turn the engine over. In most cases, only the left magneto is active (the right p-lead is grounded) due to timing differences between the magnetos at low RPMs.
*Tachometer - A gauge to indicate engine speed in RPM or percentage of maximum.
*Manifold pressure (MP) gauge - Indicates the absolute pressure in the intake manifold. For an aircraft equipped with a constant speed propeller, this is the most direct indication of the engine&#x27;s operating power. A fully open throttle would show a manifold pressure roughly equal to the ambient air pressure, i.e. full power; note that the maximum therefore changes with altitude unless the engine is equipped with a turbocharger or similar intake air pressure increasing system. As the throttle is closed, this pressure is reduced due to restricting the fuel/air mixture available to the engine, i.e. causing it to operate at lower power than it is capable of producing.
*Oil temperature gauge - Indicates the engine oil temperature.
*Oil pressure gauge - Indicates the supply pressure of the engine lubricant.
*Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) gauge - Indicates the temperature of the exhaust gas just after combustion. If only one reading is provided, it measures the typically hottest cylinder&#x27;s exhaust. Used to set the air-fuel mixture (leaning) correctly.
*Cylinder head temperature (CHT) gauge - Indicates the temperature of at least one of the cylinder heads. The CHT is most directly affected by the volume and temperature of airflow passing over the air-cooled cylinder heads. Most high-performance engines provide adjustable cowl flaps to manage this airflow and thereby maintain an appropriate CHT.
*Carburetor heat control - Controls the application of heat to the carburetor venturi area to remove or prevent the formation of ice in the throat of the carburetor as well as bypassing the air filter in case of impact icing.
*Alternate air - Bypasses the air filter on a fuel-injected engine.

==Fuel==
*Fuel primer pump - A manual pump to add a small amount of fuel at the cylinder intakes to assist in starting a cold engine. Fuel-injected engines do not have this control. For fuel-injected engines, a fuel boost pump is used to prime the engine prior to start.
*Fuel quantity gauge - Indicates the amount of fuel remaining in the identified tank. One per fuel tank. Some aircraft use a single gauge for all tanks, with a selector switch that can be turned to select the tank one wishes to have displayed on the shared gauge, including a setting to show the total fuel in all tanks. An example of switch settings could be &quot;Left, Right, Fuselage, Total&quot;. This saves room on the instrument panel by negating the need for four different dedicated fuel gauges.
*Fuel select valve - Connects the fuel flow from the selected tank to the engine.

If the aircraft is equipped with a fuel pump:
*Fuel pressure gauge - Indicates the supply pressure of fuel to the carburetor (or in the case of a fuel-injected engine, to the fuel controller.)
*Fuel boost pump switch - Controls the operation of the auxiliary electric fuel pump to provide fuel to the engine before it starts or in case of failure of the engine-powered fuel pump. Some large aeroplanes have a fuel system that allows the flight crew to jettison or dump the fuel. When operated, the boost pumps in the fuel tanks pump the fuel to the dump chutes or jettison nozzles and overboard to the atmosphere.

==Propeller==
In an aircraft with a fixed-pitch propeller, there is no direct control over the propeller rotational speed, which depends on the airspeed and loading. Therefore, the pilot has to pay attention to the RPM indicator and adjust the throttle/power lever in order to maintain the desired constant speed of the propeller. For example, when the airspeed reduces and the loading increases (e.g., in a climb), RPM will decrease and the pilot has to increase the throttle/power. When the airspeed increases and the loading decreases (e.g., in a dive), the RPM will increase and the pilot has to decrease the throttle/power in order to prevent RPM from exceeding the operational limits and damaging the motor.

If the aircraft is equipped with adjustable-pitch or constant-speed propeller(s):
*Blade pitch control - Maximizes the efficiency of the propeller in different operational conditions (i.e., airspeed) by controlling the desired propeller rotational speed. In adjustable-pitch propeller control system, the pilot has to adjust the propeller pitch angle and thus angle of attack of the propeller blades (typically with a lever) to achieve the desired propeller rotational speed. The increased pitch (blade angle of attack) increases the load on the engine and therefore slows it down, and vice versa. However, the actual propeller speed remains stable only if operational conditions (e.g., airspeed) do not change, otherwise the pilot has to constantly adjust the pitch to maintain the desired propeller speed. Constant-speed propeller control system simplifies this for the pilot by introducing a propeller governor, where the lever controls the desired propeller speed instead of the pitch angle. Once the pilot has set the desired propeller speed, the propeller governor maintains that propeller speed by adjusting the pitch of the propeller blades, using the engine&#x27;s oil pressure to move a hydraulic piston in the propeller hub. Many modern aircraft use single-lever power control (SLPC) system, where on-board computer (FADEC) automatically manages the propeller speed based on the desired power setting and operational conditions. The output power from the propeller is equal to a product of propeller efficiency and input power from the engine.
*Manifold pressure gauge - When the engine is running normally, there is a good correlation between the intake manifold pressure and the torque the engine is developing. The input power into the propeller is equal to a product of propeller rotational speed and torque.

==Cowl==

If the aircraft is equipped with adjustable Cowl Flaps:
*Cowl flap position control - Cowl Flaps are opened during high power/low airspeed operations like takeoff to maximize the volume of cooling airflow over the engine&#x27;s cooling fins.
*Cylinder head temperature gauge - Indicates the temperature of all cylinder heads or on a single CHT system, the hottest head. A Cylinder Head Temperature Gauge has a much shorter response time than the oil temperature gauge, so it can alert the pilot to a developing cooling issue more quickly. Engine overheating may be caused by:
*#Running too long at a high power setting.
*#Poor leaning technique.
*#Restricting the volume of cooling airflow too much.
*#Insufficient delivery of lubricating oil to the engine&#x27;s moving parts.

<text>Mary Williams (June 27, 1869 – February 11, 1961), who wrote pseudonymously as Kate Carew, was an American caricaturist self-styled as &quot;The Only Woman Caricaturist&quot;. She worked at the &quot;New York World&quot;, providing illustrated celebrity interviews.

== Education ==
Convent of Notre Dame, San Jose, Cal.; Mark Hopkins Institute of Art, University of California.; awarded gold medal for painting, 1891; Studied at the Atelier Colarossi, Paris, and the N.Y. School of Art.

==Biography==

Mary Williams (pseudonym &quot;Kate Carew&quot;) was born in Oakland, California, and began her art training at San Francisco’s School of Design under the esteemed Arthur Mathews and received the school’s “Special Medal for Excellence in Painting” at the local Art Association’s 1891 Winter Annual. Her brother was Gluyas Williams.

From 1891 to 1895 her art received awards at the California State Fair. She exhibited at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. After the death of her first husband, Seymour Chapin Davison, in 1897 she became, under the sponsorship of Ambrose Bierce, a staff illustrator of portrait sketches at &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;.
In 1899 Mary Williams Davison moved to New York City and established a studio-residence on West Twenty-Fourth Street. She was hired by Joseph Pulitzer to publish her caricature drawings and interviews of celebrities under the pseudonym “Kate Carew” for his &quot;Sunday World&quot; and &quot;Evening World&quot;, divisions of the &quot;New York World&quot;. In 1901 she married the Australian journalist and playwright Henry Kellett Chambers. In September 1910 she gave birth to a son, Colin Chambers, and the following year divorced her husband for his infidelities with the Mexican writer Maria Cristina Mena.

In 1911 she was sent to Europe by the &quot;Sunday World&quot; to publish the series &quot;Kate Carew Abroad&quot;. She traveled to London and Paris, where she interviewed Pablo Picasso and Rostand, John Galsworthy, George Moore, Émile Zola, Bret Harte (who happened to be in England), Lady Sackville-West, and many others. She wrote about 500 pieces for New York City newspapers and later for the &quot;Tatler&quot; (London), &quot;The Patrician&quot;, and &quot;Eve&quot;.
She was among those who visited `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, then head of the Baháʼí Faith, during his visit to the States and travelled with him for a number of days. On April 16, 1912, with Mary Williams still travelling with him, `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá visited the Bowery. Mary Williams noted that she was impressed with `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá&#x27;s generosity of spirit in bringing people of social standing to the Bowery as well as that he then gave money to the poor rather than accepting it.

She became severely ill in December 1913 and returned to the States after surgery. While conducting interviews in Hollywood for the London &quot;Strand&quot; she met and married the British-born John A. Reed in December 1916. The following spring they moved to Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. She became an exhibiting member of the Carmel Arts &amp; Crafts Club and staged a solo exhibit at Monterey’s Hotel Del Monte with over two dozen caricatures, including Woodrow Wilson, Mark Twain, and Ethel Barrymore, to rave reviews. Beginning in the early 1920s, when a severe wrist injury temporarily limited her career, the Reeds resided primarily at Guernsey in the Channel Islands or in France. She exhibited at the Salon des Artistes of Paris in 1924 and 1928; on the latter date she displayed &quot;Farm at Hyeres&quot;. In June 1938 they returned to the Monterey Peninsula. John Reed died in June 1941 at a sanatorium in St. Helena. Mary Williams returned to Monterey in the spring of 1943, purchased the former home of the painter Lucy Valentine Pierce, and devoted herself to seascapes and landscapes. She died at the age of 91 in a Pacific Grove rest home and is buried in Oakland.

<text>Cyclopropane is the cycloalkane with the molecular formula (CH2)3, consisting of three methylene groups (CH2) linked to each other to form a triangular ring. The small size of the ring creates substantial ring strain in the structure. Cyclopropane itself is mainly of theoretical interest but many of its derivatives - cyclopropanes - are of commercial or biological significance. 

Cyclopropane was used as a clinical inhalational anesthetic from the 1930s through the 1980s. The substance&#x27;s high flammability poses a risk of fire and explosions in operating rooms due to its tendency to accumulate in confined spaces, as its density is higher than that of air.

==History==
Cyclopropane was discovered in 1881 by August Freund, who also proposed the correct structure for the substance in his first paper. Freund treated 1,3-dibromopropane with sodium, causing an intramolecular Wurtz reaction leading directly to cyclopropane. The yield of the reaction was improved by Gustavson in 1887 with the use of zinc instead of sodium. Cyclopropane had no commercial application until Henderson and Lucas discovered its anaesthetic properties in 1929; industrial production had begun by 1936. In modern anaesthetic practice, it has been superseded by other agents.

===Anaesthesia===
Cyclopropane was introduced into clinical use by the American anaesthetist Ralph Waters who used a closed system with carbon dioxide absorption to conserve this then-costly agent.
Cyclopropane is a relatively potent, non-irritating and sweet smelling agent with a minimum alveolar concentration of 17.5% and a of 0.55. This meant induction of anaesthesia by inhalation of cyclopropane and oxygen was rapid and not unpleasant. However at the conclusion of prolonged anaesthesia patients could suffer a sudden decrease in blood pressure, potentially leading to cardiac dysrhythmia: a reaction known as &quot;cyclopropane shock&quot;. For this reason, as well as its high cost and its explosive nature, it was latterly used only for the induction of anaesthesia, and has not been available for clinical use since the mid-1980s.
Cylinders and flow meters were colored orange.

===Pharmacology===
Cyclopropane is inactive at the GABAA and glycine receptors, and instead acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist. It also inhibits the AMPA receptor and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and activates certain K2P channels.

==Structure and bonding==
The triangular structure of cyclopropane requires the bond angles between carbon-carbon covalent bonds to be 60°. The molecule has D3h molecular symmetry. The C-C distances are 151 pm versus 153-155 pm.

Despite their shortness, the C-C bonds in cyclopropane are weakened by 34 kcal/mol vs ordinary C-C bonds. In addition to ring strain, the molecule also has torsional strain due to the eclipsed conformation of its hydrogen atoms. The C-H bonds in cyclopropane are stronger than ordinary C-H bonds as reflected by NMR coupling constants.

Bonding between the carbon centres is generally described in terms of bent bonds. In this model the carbon-carbon bonds are bent outwards so that the inter-orbital angle is 104°.

The unusual structural properties of cyclopropane have spawned many theoretical discussions. One theory invokes σ-aromaticity: the stabilization afforded by delocalization of the six electrons of cyclopropane&#x27;s three C-C σ bonds to explain why the strain of cyclopropane is &quot;only&quot; 27.6 kcal/mol as compared to cyclobutane (26.2 kcal/mol) with cyclohexane as reference with Estr=0 kcal/mol, in contrast to the usual π aromaticity, that, for example, has a highly stabilizing effect in benzene. Other studies do not support the role of σ-aromaticity in cyclopropane and the existence of an induced ring current; such studies provide an alternative explanation for the energetic stabilization and abnormal magnetic behaviour of cyclopropane.

==Synthesis==
Cyclopropane was first produced via a Wurtz coupling, in which 1,3-dibromopropane was cyclised using sodium. The yield of this reaction can be improved by the use of zinc as the dehalogenating agent and sodium iodide as a catalyst.
:BrCH2CH2CH2Br + 2 Na → (CH2)3 + 2 NaBr

The preparation of cyclopropane rings is referred to as cyclopropanation.

==Reactions==
Owing to the increased π-character of its C-C bonds, cyclopropane is often assumed to add bromine to give 1,3-dibromopropane, but this reaction proceeds poorly. Hydrohalogenation with hydrohalic acids gives linear 1-halopropanes. Substituted cyclopropanes also react, following Markovnikov&#x27;s rule. 

Cyclopropane and its derivatives can oxidatively add to transition metals, in a process referred to as C–C activation.

==Safety==
Cyclopropane is highly flammable. However, despite its strain energy it does not exhibit explosive behavior substantially different from other alkanes.

<doc id="384744" wikidata="Q211433" url="?curid=384744" title="Cyclohexane">
<text>Cyclohexane is a cycloalkane with the molecular formula . Cyclohexane is non-polar. Cyclohexane is a colourless, flammable liquid with a distinctive detergent-like odor, reminiscent of cleaning products (in which it is sometimes used). Cyclohexane is mainly used for the industrial production of adipic acid and caprolactam, which are precursors to nylon.

Cyclohexyl () is the alkyl substituent of cyclohexane and is abbreviated Cy.

==Production==
Cyclohexane is one of components of naphtha, from which it can be extracted by advanced distillation methods. Distillation is usually combined with isomerization of methylcyclopentane, a similar component extracted from naphtha by similar methods. Together, these processes cover only a minority (15-20%) of the modern industrial demand, and are complemented by synthesis.

===Modern industrial synthesis===
On an industrial scale, cyclohexane is produced by hydrogenation of benzene in the presence of a Raney nickel catalyst. Producers of cyclohexane account for approximately 11.4% of global demand for benzene. The reaction is highly exothermic, with ΔH(500 K) = -216.37 kJ/mol. Dehydrogenation commenced noticeably above 300 °C, reflecting the favorable entropy for dehydrogenation.

===History of synthesis===
Unlike benzene, cyclohexane is not found in natural resources such as coal. For this reason, early investigators synthesized their cyclohexane samples.

====Failure====
* In 1867 Marcellin Berthelot reduced benzene with hydroiodic acid at elevated temperatures.
* In 1870, Adolf von Baeyer repeated the reaction and pronounced the same reaction product &quot;hexahydrobenzene&quot;.
* In 1890 Vladimir Markovnikov believed he was able to distill the same compound from Caucasus petroleum, calling his concoction &quot;hexanaphtene&quot;.

Surprisingly, their cyclohexanes boiled higher by 10 °C than either hexahydrobenzene or hexanaphthene, but this riddle was solved in 1895 by Markovnikov, N.M. Kishner, and Nikolay Zelinsky when they reassigned &quot;hexahydrobenzene&quot; and &quot;hexanaphtene&quot; as methylcyclopentane, the result of an unexpected rearrangement reaction.

====Success====
In 1894, Baeyer synthesized cyclohexane starting with a ketonic decarboxylation of pimelic acid followed by multiple reductions:

In the same year, E. Haworth and W.H. Perkin Jr. (1860–1929) prepared it via a Wurtz reaction of 1,6-dibromohexane.

==Reactions and uses==
Although rather unreactive, cyclohexane undergoes autoxidation to give a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. The cyclohexanone–cyclohexanol mixture, called &quot;KA oil&quot;, is a raw material for adipic acid and caprolactam, precursors to nylon. Several million kilograms of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol are produced annually.

It is used as a solvent in some brands of correction fluid. Cyclohexane is sometimes used as a non-polar organic solvent, although n-hexane is more widely used for this purpose. It is frequently used as a recrystallization solvent, as many organic compounds exhibit good solubility in hot cyclohexane and poor solubility at low temperatures.

Cyclohexane is also used for calibration of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) instruments, because of a convenient crystal-crystal transition at −87.1 °C.

Cyclohexane vapour is used in vacuum carburizing furnaces, in heat treating equipment manufacture.

==Conformation==
The 6-vertex edge ring does not conform to the shape of a perfect hexagon. The conformation of a flat 2D planar hexagon has considerable strain because the C-H bonds would be eclipsed. Therefore, to reduce torsional strain, cyclohexane adopts a three-dimensional structure known as the chair conformation, which rapidly interconvert at room temperature via a process known as a chair flip. During the chair flip, there are three other intermediate conformations that are encountered: the half-chair, which is the most unstable conformation, the more stable boat conformation, and the twist-boat, which is more stable than the boat but still much less stable than the chair. The chair and twist-boat are energy minima and are therefore conformers, while the half-chair and the boat are transition states and represent energy maxima. The idea that the chair conformation is the most stable structure for cyclohexane was first proposed as early as 1890 by Hermann Sachse, but only gained widespread acceptance much later. The new conformation puts the carbons at an angle of 109.5°. Half of the hydrogens are in the plane of the ring (&quot;equatorial&quot;) while the other half are perpendicular to the plane (&quot;axial&quot;). This conformation allows for the most stable structure of cyclohexane. Another conformation of cyclohexane exists, known as boat conformation, but it interconverts to the slightly more stable chair formation. If cyclohexane is mono-substituted with a large substituent, then the substituent will most likely be found attached in an equatorial position, as this is the slightly more stable conformation.

Cyclohexane has the lowest angle and torsional strain of all the cycloalkanes; as a result cyclohexane has been deemed a 0 in total ring strain.

===Solid phases===
Cyclohexane has two crystalline phases. The high-temperature phase I, stable between 186 K and the melting point 280 K, is a plastic crystal, which means the molecules retain some rotational degree of freedom. The low-temperature (below 186 K) phase II is ordered. Two other low-temperature (metastable) phases III and IV have been obtained by application of moderate pressures above 30 MPa, where phase IV appears exclusively in deuterated cyclohexane (application of pressure increases the values of all transition temperatures).

Here Z is the number structure units per unit cell; the unit cell constants a, b and c were measured at the given temperature T and pressure P.

<doc id="384745" wikidata="Q948828" url="?curid=384745" title="Tales of the Gold Monkey">
<text>Tales of the Gold Monkey was an American adventure drama television series broadcast in prime time on Wednesday nights by ABC from September 22, 1982, until June 1, 1983. Debuting the year following the release of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, the series featured early aviation, indigenous locals, and cliff-hanging action. Creator Don Bellisario said it was based on the 1939 Howard Hawks film &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot;.

==Premise and major characters==

Set in 1938 in the South Pacific, the series is about an ex-Flying Tigers fighter pilot named Jake Cutter (Stephen Collins). Now the operator of an air cargo delivery service based on the fictional South Seas island Bora Gora, he flies a red and white Grumman Goose called &quot;Cutter&#x27;s Goose&quot;. Jake&#x27;s best friend is his mechanic Corky (Jeff MacKay), a good-hearted alcoholic with a hazy memory from heavy drinking. However, a one-eyed Jack Russell terrier named Jack, which barks once for &quot;no&quot; and twice for &quot;yes&quot; (or the opposite if it suits him) would dispute just who Jake&#x27;s best friend really is. Jack wears an eye patch, but used to have a false eye made of opal with a star sapphire centre that Jake lost in a poker game—and refuses to let Jake forget it.

Jake&#x27;s love interest and U.S. government spy contact is Sarah Stickney White (Caitlin O&#x27;Heaney). She sings in the Monkey Bar as a cover for her espionage activities. The Reverend Willie Tenboom (John Calvin), a phony man of the cloth who likes to &quot;bless&quot; the female natives in private &quot;prayer&quot;, is in reality a Nazi spy named Willy, with interests in both sides.

&quot;Bon Chance&quot; Louie (played by Ron Moody in the pilot, Roddy McDowall in the series) is the owner of the Monkey Bar and the French magistrate for Bora Gora. Jake&#x27;s nemesis is the Japanese princess Koji (Marta DuBois), a Dragon Lady type of character who has eyes for Jake. Koji&#x27;s devoted bodyguard is Todo (John Fujioka), a fierce practitioner of Bushido and loyal to the princess. (Although Calvin, DuBois, and Fujioka were billed on the opening credits of each episode, they actually only appeared on a semi-regular basis in a handful of episodes.)

The title is derived from a gigantic mythical golden statue that is the focal point of the pilot episode, seen only by the viewer at the end of the show. The characters end their search for the statue after finding a substitute brass monkey that is kept at the Monkey Bar for the rest of the series.

Originally, the series was to be called &quot;Tales of the Brass Monkey&quot;, but the Heublein company had run a series of magazine ads with exactly that name about a bar in the Far East, with hints of Casablanca intrigue and references to the Kenpeitai; so, to avoid legal difficulties, the name was changed to &quot;Gold Monkey&quot;. At the end of the pilot episode, it is revealed that the statue at the bar was actually brass and not gold. However, unknown to the characters (and revealed to viewers only just before the end credits), the island where the statue was found does contain a massive structure apparently made of solid gold that does resemble a monkey. However, a thousand years of neglect had left it covered in vegetation and debris, and it is only exposed by the same volcanic eruption that forces the characters off the island.

As with most of creator Donald P. Bellisario&#x27;s projects, links exist to his other shows. The most notable is of the character Gandy Dancer (played by William Lucking), an ace pilot treasure hunter who appears in the episodes &quot;Legends Are Forever&quot; and – in flashback form – in &quot;Honor Thy Brother&quot;. Although Gandy dies in &quot;Legends Are Forever&quot;, Bellisario liked the character enough to adapt him to the present day. The third-season episode &quot;Two Birds of a Feather&quot; of Bellisario&#x27;s hit &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, has Lucking playing the very similar character of Sam Houston Hunter, also an ace pilot. The episode, which noticeably has little appearance of Magnum or any other regular characters, acted as a backdoor pilot for a proposed spin-off series starring Lucking. However, the series was never picked up, although Bellisario stripped down the &quot;adventures of an ace pilot&quot; concept and worked it into &quot;Airwolf&quot; (1984–1986). Jeff MacKay had recurring roles in &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, and later &quot;JAG&quot; (1995–2005), and Marta DuBois played the role of Magnum&#x27;s estranged wife Michelle, long-presumed dead, in a story arc that spanned most of that show&#x27;s run. MacKay and Calvin both went on to play several guest roles in &quot;Airwolf&quot;; and McDowall, MacKay, Calvin (and stock footage of the Goose) all went on to have guest appearances on the Bellisario series &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; (1989–1993). Stock footage of the Goose was also used in &quot;The A-Team&quot; episode &quot;The Island&quot; (season three, episode eight) and in &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; Episode &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; (season four, episode 16). Additionally, Jake&#x27;s surname, Cutter, was previously an early working title and character name for that of &quot;Magnum&quot;, and Bellisario later reused the name &quot;Gushie&quot;, who in &quot;Gold Monkey&quot; was a waiter at the Monkey Bar who used a wheelchair, for a member of the &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; project team.

Although generally well-received in both the United States and overseas (such as the United Kingdom, where it was broadcast on BBC One on Monday evenings), the show was not renewed for another season, mostly due to the ratings not justifying the high cost of production.

This show was an inspiration for the Disney animated series &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, according to series creators Jymn Magon and Mark Zaslove. It also heavily inspired the ninth season of the animated series &quot;Archer&quot;, &quot;Danger Island&quot;.

A fictional recursion occurs in &quot;The Sultan of Swat&quot; in which – while waiting for the Boeing 314 Pan Am Clipper – Jake is reading a book with a dustcover titled &quot;Murder on the Footbridge&quot;, which is apparently a key plot reference from the 1941 Alfred Hitchcock movie &quot;Suspicion&quot;.

<doc id="384749" wikidata="Q155368" url="?curid=384749" title="Alicyclic compound">
<text>In organic chemistry, an alicyclic compound contains one or more all-carbon rings which may be either saturated or unsaturated, but do not have aromatic character. Alicyclic compounds may have one or more aliphatic side chains attached.

The simplest alicyclic compounds are the monocyclic cycloalkanes: cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, cyclooctane, and so on. Bicyclic alkanes include bicycloundecane, decalin, and housane. Polycyclic alkanes include cubane, basketane, and tetrahedrane.

Spiro compounds have two or more rings that are connected through only one carbon atom.

The mode of ring-closing in the formation of many alicyclic compounds can be predicted by Baldwin&#x27;s rules.

Otto Wallach, a German chemist, received the 1910 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on alicyclic compounds.
==Cycloalkenes==
Monocyclic cycloalkenes are cyclopropene, cyclobutene, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, cycloheptene, cyclooctene, and so on. Bicyclic alkenes include norbornene and norbornadiene.

Two more examples are shown below, methylenecyclohexane on the left and 1-methylcyclohexene on the right:


An exocyclic group is always shown outside the ring structure, take for instance the exocyclic double bond of the former molecule. Isotoluenes are a prominent class of compounds with exocyclic double bonds.

The placement of double bonds in many alicyclic compounds can be predicted with Bredt&#x27;s rule.

* G wing: remands and convicted (G5 enhanced only)

G wing has an education department, a library and workshops.

There are problems with drugs and weapons being thrown into the prison. Following the 2016 prison escape, Camilla Poulton of Pentonville Prison Independent Monitoring Board (IMB), said: 
 From 2018/2019 new windows were placed and, outside window cages, netting was put up, after the escape from G wing, around the whole prison to stop drones and parcels being received.

Mike Rolfe, chair of the Prison Officers’ Association, said:
In 2015 the justice secretary, Michael Gove, described Pentonville as &quot;the most dramatic example of failure&quot; within the prisons estate.

In 2017, it was reported that the IMB described Pentonville as squalid and inhumane. Blocked toilets and leaking sewage were found, broken facilities meant prisoners going without clean clothes, showers and hot food. Prisoners were regularly confined two to a cell 12 foot by 8 foot. The report stated, &quot;The prison struggles to ensure the basics of decency largely due to the outsourced provider responsible for maintenance: Carillion. The contract is working neither for Pentonville nor the taxpayer&quot;. The report noted improvements, including uniformed staff using body-worn cameras and anti-drone technology. There was concern about the frequency of assaults on staff, which at that time averaged about 10 a month.

==History==
The first modern prison in London, Millbank, opened in 1816. It had separate cells for 860 prisoners and proved satisfactory to the authorities who started building prisons to deal with the rapid increase in numbers occasioned by the ending of capital punishment for many crimes and a steady reduction in transportation.
Two Acts of Parliament allowed for the building of Pentonville prison, designed by Captain Joshua Jebb, Royal Engineers, for the detention of convicts sentenced to imprisonment or awaiting transportation. Construction started on 10 April 1840 and was completed in 1842. The cost was £84,186 12s 2d.
It had a central hall with four radiating wings, all visible to staff at the centre. This design, intended to keep prisoners isolated – the &quot;separate system&quot; first used at Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia – was not, as is often thought, a panopticon. Officers had no view into individual cells from their central position. Pentonville was designed to hold 520 prisoners under the separate system, each having his own cell, long, wide and high with little windows on the outside walls and opening on to narrow landings in the galleries.

They were &quot;admirably ventilated&quot;, a visitor wrote, and had a water closet, though these were replaced by communal, foul-smelling recesses because they were constantly blocked and the pipes were used for communication. The cost of keeping a prisoner at Pentonville was about 15 shillings a week in the 1840s.

Prisoners were forbidden to speak to each other and when out on exercise would tramp in silent rows, wearing brown cloth masks. In chapel, which they had to attend every day, they sat in cubicles, or &quot;coffins&quot; as the prisoners referred to them, their heads visible to the warder but hidden from each other. The chaplains were very influential, making individual cell visitations, urging the convicts to reform, and supervising the work of the schoolmasters.

Mental disturbances were common. An official report admitted that &quot;for every sixty thousand persons imprisoned in Pentonville there were 220 cases of insanity, 210 cases of delusion, and forty suicides&quot;. However, conditions were better and healthier than at Newgate and similar older prisons, and each prisoner was made to do work such as picking oakum (tarred rope) and weaving. The work lasted from six in the morning until seven at night. The food ration was a breakfast of 10 ounces of bread and three-quarters of a pint of cocoa; dinner was half a pint of soup (or four ounces of meat), five ounces of bread, and one pound of potatoes; supper a pint of gruel and five ounces of bread.

Pentonville became the model for British prisons; a further 54 were built to similar designs over six years and hundreds throughout the British Empire. For instance, Pentonville was used as a model for the eventual construction of Corradino prison in Rahal Gdid, Malta by W. Lamb Arrowsmith in 1842.

===Execution site===
Prisoners under sentence of death were not housed at Pentonville Prison until the closure of Newgate in 1902 when Pentonville took over executions in north London. Condemned cells were added and an execution room built to house Newgate&#x27;s gallows. At the same time, Pentonville took over from Newgate the function of being the training location for future executioners.

Irish revolutionary Roger Casement was hanged there on 3 August 1916 and his remains interred at the site until 1965. Udham Singh, the Indian revolutionary, who shot and killed Sir Michael O&#x27;Dwyer (Governor of the Punjab during the Amritsar Massacre), was also held in custody and hanged at Pentonville (1940); Karl Hultén, involved in the Cleft chin murder, was executed 8 March 1945.

Between 1902 and 1961 a total of 120 men were executed at Pentonville including Dr. Crippen and John Christie. All the executed were buried in unmarked graves, in the prison cemetery located at . The final execution took place on 6 July 1961 when Edwin Bush, aged 21, was hanged.

==21st century==
In May 2003, an inspection report from the Chief Inspector of Prisons blamed overcrowding for poor standards at HMP Pentonville. The inspection found that basic requirements for inmates such as telephones, showers and clean clothes were not being provided regularly enough. The report also noted a lack of access to education for inmates and inadequate specialised procedures for vulnerable prisoners. The inspection report also praised a number of areas of the prison including the healthcare department, the prison drugs strategy and programmes for reducing offending behaviour.

A new hospital wing, built at a cost of £15 million, was opened at Pentonville Prison in early 2005. Months later inspectors reported that despite the new facilities, primary care for prisoners such as clinical supervision of nurses and drug dispensing practices were inadequate. A year later, 14 prison officers at Pentonville were suspended after allegations of trafficking and &quot;inappropriate relations&quot; with inmates.

In August 2007, a report from the Pentonville&#x27;s Independent Monitoring Board stated that the prison was infested with rats and cockroaches and had insufficient levels of staff. The report also criticised the detention conditions for mentally ill inmates, the reception facilities for new prisoners and the library provision at the jail.

In October 2009, two prison managers were warned about gross misconduct after an investigation found that 11 inmates had been temporarily transferred to HMP Wandsworth before inspections. The prisoners, two of whom attempted suicide immediately after the transfer, were transferred two days before an inspection in order to manipulate prison population figures.

In February 2014, a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick said there are &quot;huge challenges&quot; at Pentonville and that it will not have a &quot;viable future&quot; without a major refurbishment and extra staff.

A further report released in June 2015 indicated that Pentonville had &quot;deteriorated even further&quot; since the previous inspection. The report highlighted that many inmates were left without basic provisions, including pillows and utensils, that there were &quot;mounds of rubbish&quot; on the floors and cockroach infestations. Frances Cook, chief executive for the Howard League for Penal Reform, commented &quot;when a prison is asked to hold 350 more prisoners than it is designed for, we should not be surprised when it fails&quot;.

A prisoner, Jamal Mahmoud was stabbed to death on 18 October 2016 and there were six other stabbings in the following weeks up to 8 November.

In 2018 monitors found Pentonville was dilapidated, overcrowded and porous to drugs, mobile phones and weapons. Windows noted as insecure in 2016 are still insecure, vermin is rife and many prisoners go for weeks without exercise in fresh air. Gang-related incidents during prayer meetings have increased. Staff are energetic and committed but there were too few staff most of the time. Wings were shut down for three or four half days a week, activities and association time were limited. At the end of July 2018 the prison held 1,215 men. The IMB singled out for praise a social enterprise set up to reduce recidivism by training prisoners in cooking and entrepreneurship, Liberty Kitchen.

===Prisoner escapes===
* 2006: Prisoner escaped during transit between Pentonville Prison and a hospital facility
* 2009: Convicted arsonist Julien Chautard escaped by clinging on to the underside of the prison van which had delivered him to the jail from Snaresbrook Crown Court. He returned to the prison four days later after giving himself up to police.
* 2012: Convicted murderer John Massey escaped from within the prison confines at Pentonville on Wednesday 27 June 2012, 18:30 BST, and was recaptured in Kent two days later following what police described as &quot;an intelligence-led operation&quot;.
* 2016: Two prisoners, Matthew Baker, 28, and James Whitlock, 31, escaped after they allegedly used diamond-tipped cutting equipment to break through cell bars before they scaled the perimeter wall; the escape was discovered when prison staff found pillows imitating bodies in the prisoners&#x27; beds. The public was warned not to approach the escaped prisoners. Baker was recaptured a few days later hiding in his sister&#x27;s house in Ilford, with Whitlock found by police six days after the breakout.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian13/11/2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prison Officers Association said that the escape of Baker and Whitlock followed years of underinvestment and staff cuts. Steve Gillan of the POA said, &quot;The reality of the situation is the focus should be on Government and their budget cuts that have created this situation. The basics of security aren&#x27;t getting done simply because there is not enough staff to deal with the daily tasks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC8/11/2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The prison&#x27;s independent inspection watchdog described Pentonville as a &quot;soft target&quot; through the &quot;dilapidated&quot; state of the Victorian building. Emily Thornberry MP called the escape the &quot;final straw&quot; and urged that the prison should be closed. &quot;People don&#x27;t seem to be safe inside Pentonville and now it transpires inmates can escape. (...) If they don&#x27;t have control of the place, what is the point of it being there? This was built in 1842 and is totally inappropriate for modern needs.&quot;

<text>The , known from 2000 to 2003 as Mizuho Holdings and abbreviated as MHFG or simply Mizuho, is a Japanese banking holding company headquartered in the Ōtemachi district of Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan. The group was formed in 2000-2002 by merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and Industrial Bank of Japan. The name literally means &quot;abundant rice&quot; in Japanese and &quot;harvest&quot; in the figurative sense. 

Mizuho Financial Group is the parent holding of Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Trust &amp; Banking, Mizuho Securities, and Mizuho Capital, and the majority owner of Asset Management One. The group offers a range of financial services, including banking, securities, trust and asset management services, employing more than 59,000 people throughout 880 offices. It is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange—where it is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Core30 indices—and in the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American depositary receipts.

Upon its founding, Mizuho was the largest bank in the world by assets. Following further consolidation, it has become the third-largest of Japan&#x27;s so-called megabanks with total assets of $1.9 trillion at end-March 2023, behind Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ($2.9 trillion) and SMBC Group ($2.0 trillion). Mizuho was the 15th largest banking institution in the world by total assets as of December 2018, and the 90th largest company in the world according to Forbes rankings as of May 2017. It has been consistently listed as a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.

== History ==
The history of the banks that formed Mizuho combines multiple threads of Japanese financial history, going back to the early Meiji era and particularly the establishment in 1873 of Dai-Ichi Bank, Japan&#x27;s first modern bank and joint-stock company led by Shibusawa Eiichi, if not even earlier with the foundation of trading house Yasuda-ya in 1864. In addition to Dai-Ichi (whose name literally means &quot;number one&quot;), Mizuho also incorporates several of the subsequent National Banks in Meiji Japan which were numbered in accordance with their chronological date of establishment until 1880: 
* the , licensed in 1873 with a view to establish a bank in Osaka, then established in Tokyo in 1876 after the previous plan was shelved; merged 1923 with multiple other banks to form Yasuda Bank, which in 1948 was renamed Fuji Bank; 
* the 6th National Bank, est. 1877 in Fukushima, relocated 1892 to Tokyo, merged 1907 into the 9th Bank (below); 
* the 9th National Bank, est. 1877 in Kumamoto, absorbed the 6th Bank in 1907 and became the Higo Bank which in 1923 merged with the 3rd Bank and others to form the Yasuda Bank;
* the 20th National Bank, est. 1877 in Tokyo, merged 1912 into Dai-Ichi Bank; 
* the , est. 1877 in Okayama, another participant in the 1923 merger that formed Yasuda Bank; 
* the 36th National bank, est. 1878 in Hachiōji, acquired 1942 by Nihon Chuya Bank which merged into Yasuda Bank in 1943; 
* the 40th National Bank, est. 1878 in Tatebayashi, merged 1918 with the 41st Bank to form Tokai Bank (namesake of but different from the later Tokai Bank) which itself merged into Dai-Ichi Bank in 1927; 
* the 41st National Bank, est. 1878 in Tochigi, merged 1918 with the 40th Bank; 
* the 44th National Bank, est. 1878 in Tokyo, merged 1882 into the 3rd National Bank;
* the 58th National Bank, est. 1878 in Osaka, merged 1909 into the 130th Bank (see below); 
* the , est. 1878 in Ōtsu, renamed Otsu Bank in 1898 and merged 1908 into which collapsed in 1928 and was absorbed by , itself merged 1944 into Yasuda Bank; 
* the 82nd National Bank, est. 1878 in Tottori, merged 1897 into the 3rd Bank; 
* the 84th National Bank, est. 1878 in Daishōji, acquired 1928 by Showa Bank; 
* the 87th National Bank, est. 1878 in Ōhashi, merged 1902 into the 130th Bank; 
* the 103rd National Bank, est. 1878 in Iwakuni, acquired 1893 by the Bank of Japan which merged 1923 into Yasuda Bank; 
* the 118th National Bank, est. 1878 in Tokyo, merged 1880 into the 136th National Bank (see below); 
* the 130th National Bank, est. 1879 in Osaka, merged 1923 into Yasuda Bank;
* the 136th National Bank, est. 1879 in Handa, merged 1898 into the 130th Bank.

The group&#x27;s predecessors also include Nippon Kangyo Bank (est. 1897) and Industrial Bank of Japan (est. 1902), two institutions founded as policy banks in the Meiji era and converted into commercial banks after World War II.

===Founding merger===


Mizuho was established in 2000 as Mizuho Holdings, Inc. by the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan, first announced in 1999. It was the first financial holding company structure created among major Japanese banks. 

On , DKB, Fuji and IBJ were officially and legally combined into two banks, Mizuho Bank, Ltd. and Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., through a split and merger process reorganizing the three legacy banks. Initially Mizuho traded under the ticker symbol MHHD on the London Stock Exchange. Mizuho Corporate Bank focused on large corporations, financial institutions and public sector entities in Japan and overseas, whereas Mizuho Bank focused on individuals and small and medium-sized companies in Japan.

The merger resulted in the world&#x27;s first trillion-dollar banking group, with its $1.2 trillion in assets, surpassing the next largest bank by about $480 billion. The move has been considered to have formed one of the first &quot;mega-institutions&quot; in the financial industry, beginning a trend in the industry of large-scale bank mergers referred to in Japan as the consolidation movement during the 2000s. While other mega-institutions were composed of one major player and several minor ones, Mizuho was composed of three relatively equal institutions in terms of their size and influence. It remained the largest mega-bank in the world until 2005.

The name &quot;Mizuho&quot; means &quot;new, bountiful, and rich harvest of rice&quot; in Japanese. The original structure saw the founding of the Mizuho Bank, focusing on individuals and SMEs, and the Mizuho Corporate Bank, which focuses on corporate entities. The initial strategy of the company was to expand its lending operations with individuals and SMEs, and begin to offer fee-based services including securitizations, merger and acquisitions support, security-based investment banking, and syndicated loans. At the time, Mizuho controlled about 50% of the syndicated loans market. Mizuho also launched one of the first Internet-based securities products in 2000.

In 2003, Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. took over the operations of Mizuho Holdings. On 1 October 2005, all subsidiaries of Mizuho Holdings were transferred to the direct control of Mizuho Financial Group. Mizuho Holdings, no longer a bank holding company, was then renamed Mizuho Financial Strategy, which now focuses on providing advisory services. Mizuho Financial Group was in turn listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol MFG in 2006.

===Subsequent development===

Mizuho Corporate Bank engaged in steady expansion overseas, opening twenty overseas offices between 2005 and 2010, particularly in China, as well as in the Americas, Europe and Middle East. In 2006, Mizuho Corporate Bank became the first Japanese bank to obtain financial holding company status in the U.S., and Mizuho Financial Group listed its ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange.

Mizuho, through its operations in New York, became involved in the subprime mortgage crisis and lost seven billion dollars on the sale of collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgages. It is the Asian bank which suffered the most losses due to the crisis. In 2012 Mizuho Financial Group acquired 100% of the assets from the Brazilian bank Banco WestLB do Brasil S.A. 

On , the group structure was simplified by a merger of Mizuho Bank and Mizuho Corporate Bank into a single banking entity that retained the name Mizuho Bank.

In 2014 the company underwent a board of directors reform to further streamline its corporate culture into a more of a single identity, although its original board founded in 2002 was consistent with Japanese banking protocols. In 2016 they opened their global transactions banking headquarters in Singapore, and have offices for this unit in China, Hong Kong, Tokyo, London, and New York City. That year they also began a partnership with Cognizant, to develop block-chain methods of securing the banks private records.

== Divisions ==

Mizuho splits its business into four distinct divisions, on a global basis:

=== Retail Group ===
Mizuho is active in retail banking with 515 branches and over 11,000 automated teller machines (ATMs). Mizuho Bank is the only bank, other than Japan Post Bank, to have branches in every prefecture in Japan. It serves over 26 million Japanese households, 90,000 SME customers, 2500 corporations, and retail brokerage clients under the name Mizuho Investors Securities nationwide, with $114 billion in retail customer assets under its management as of 2016.

* Mizuho Bank
* Mizuho Capital

=== Global Corporate Group ===
Mizuho predecessors, the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), the Fuji Bank (Fuji) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), had great control over many Japanese companies through keiretsu system. The three banks led the DKB Group, Fuyo Group and the IBJ Group respectively. The Fuyo Group traces its history as far back as the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Even now, seven out of ten companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have dealings with Mizuho.

* Mizuho Securities

=== Global wealth and asset management ===
* Mizuho Trust &amp; Banking
* Mizuho Private Wealth Management
* Asset Management One

Asset Management One manages a number of ETFs which are listed in Japan, but some of these ETFs are very illiquid because no market maker was appointed. For example, One ETF Gold (1683:JP) frequently trades at a discount of more than 10% to the NAV.

=== Strategy affiliates ===
* Mizuho Financial Strategy, formerly Mizuho Holdings, Inc.
* Mizuho Research Institute
* Mizuho Information &amp; Research Institute

== Sponsorship ==
Mizuho is a sponsor of the Tokyo International Marathon and the 2020 Olympic Games and 2020 Paralympic Games.

== Notable employees ==
* Yoichiro Esaki, member of the House of Representatives
* Rin Ishigaki, poet
* Hirotaka Ishihara, member of the House of Representatives, son of Shintaro Ishihara
* Zenkichi Kojima, mayor of Shizuoka, Shizuoka
* Takeaki Matsumoto, member of the House of Representatives
* Shoichi Nakagawa, Minister of Finance, Minister of State in charge of Financial Services (2008–2009)
* Kei Ogura, singer
* Stanley Praimnath, survivor of the destruction of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001
* Mitsu Shimojo, member of the House of Representatives
* Yukio Tomioka, member of the House of Councillors

== Controversies ==
In September 2013, a routine regulatory control unveiled that Mizuho enabled loans of up to $1.9 million to the yakuza (Japanese mafia). It also appeared that loans to the mob had been approved through its affiliate credit company Orient Corp. This scandal led to the resignation of the group&#x27;s CEO Takashi Tsukamoto.

In December 2019, a report named Mizuho as the top private lender to coal developers between January 2017 and September 2019. In March 2020, Japanese NGO Kiko Network filed the first climate related shareholder resolution with a Japanese company proposing Mizuho align its investments with the goals of the Paris Agreement, which was followed by investor support for the resolution. In response, Mizuho has agreed not to finance any further coal projects, and to end all existing loans for coal projects by the year 2050.

<text>The three-speed bicycle is a bicycle that uses internal hub gears at the rear wheel hub to provide three gear ratios.

Three-speed hubs have been in use since the early 1900s. Though they are heavier than comparable derailleur systems, internal-gear hub systems generally last longer and require less maintenance.

== Description ==
Typically, in low gear, the rear sprocket turns faster than the wheel; in middle gear, the rear sprocket turns at the same speed as the wheel; in high gear, the rear wheel turns faster than the sprocket.

== Use ==

During their heyday, three-speed hubs were used in all applications, including racing and time trialling, cargo cycling, utility cycling, and commuting. In many parts of the world, three-speed hubs are still preferred for commuting and other types of utility cycling over derailleur systems.</text><links>

<text>WrestleMania is a professional wrestling event held annually between mid-March and mid-April by the American company WWE, the world&#x27;s largest professional wrestling promotion. Since premiering in 1985, 40 events have been held, with its most recent 40th edition occurring at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 6 and 7, 2024. WrestleMania was WWE&#x27;s first pay-per-view (PPV) produced and is the most successful and longest-running professional wrestling event in history. The event has been broadcast through traditional PPV since 1985 and has been available via livestreaming since WrestleMania XXX in 2014, which was WWE&#x27;s first major event available through this medium. WrestleMania was conceptualized by former WWE executive chairman Vince McMahon and named by ring announcer and WWE Hall of Famer Howard Finkel. It is the company&#x27;s flagship event and along with Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank, it is referred to as one of the &quot;Big Five&quot;, WWE&#x27;s five biggest annual events of the year.

The widespread success of WrestleMania helped transform professional wrestling. The annual event has facilitated the rise to stardom of several top WWE wrestlers. Celebrities such as Aretha Franklin, Cyndi Lauper, Muhammad Ali, Mr. T, Mike Tyson, Donald Trump, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Snoop Dogg, Rob Gronkowski, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, and Bad Bunny, among many others, have made special appearances within the events, with some participating in matches.

The first WrestleMania was held in Madison Square Garden in New York City; the 10th and 20th editions were also held there. WrestleMania III in the Detroit suburb of Pontiac, Michigan, was the highest-attended indoor sports event in the world, with 93,173 fans in attendance. The record stood until February 14, 2010, when the 2010 NBA All-Star Game broke the indoor sporting event record with an attendance of 108,713 at Cowboys Stadium, since renamed AT&amp;T Stadium, in Arlington, Texas. In 2016, WrestleMania 32 surpassed WrestleMania III as the highest-attended professional wrestling event ever held in America, with 101,763 fans in attendance at AT&amp;T Stadium, although the company revealed that attendance figures are manipulated for marketing purposes through investor calls. All editions of the event have been hosted in North American cities, with 38 in the United States and two in Canada.

The only WrestleMania in the event&#x27;s history not to air live and be held without fans in attendance was WrestleMania 36 in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it was the first major professional wrestling event to be affected by the pandemic. It was also the first to be held across two nights, with each WrestleMania since becoming two-night events. WrestleMania 37 in 2021 was WWE&#x27;s first event back with a live crowd, but at a reduced venue capacity before the company resumed live touring with full capacity crowds in July that year.

==Organization==

Most WrestleMania events have taken place in large stadiums in large cities, with some in sports arenas. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host the year&#x27;s edition of WrestleMania. The most-attended events include WrestleMania III (93,173) in Pontiac, WrestleMania VI (67,678) in Toronto, WrestleMania VIII (62,167) in Indianapolis, WrestleMania X-Seven (67,925) in Houston, WrestleMania X8 (68,237) also in Toronto, WrestleMania XIX (54,097) in Seattle, WrestleMania 23 (80,103) in Detroit, WrestleMania XXIV (74,635) in Orlando, WrestleMania 25 (72,744) also in Houston, WrestleMania XXVI (72,219) in Phoenix, WrestleMania XXVII (71,617) in Atlanta, WrestleMania XXVIII (78,363) in Miami, WrestleMania 29 (80,676) in East Rutherford, WrestleMania XXX (75,167) in New Orleans, WrestleMania 31 (76,976) in Santa Clara, and WrestleMania 32 (101,763) in Arlington. Since moving to large stadiums and running WrestleMania Axxess, the event produces a local economy boost for the host cities.

WrestleMania centers on the main event matches, primarily for the men&#x27;s WWE Championship—and additional men&#x27;s world titles, such as the previous World Heavyweight Championship (2003–2013), the WWE Universal Championship (since 2017), and the current World Heavyweight Championship (since 2024)—as well as matches involving celebrities such as American footballer Lawrence Taylor or actor Mr. T. Other WWE championships are also contested for, while the match card also includes gimmick matches and matches involving personal feuds.

Since 1993, the winner of the annual Royal Rumble match receives a guaranteed world championship match at the same year&#x27;s WrestleMania (except in 2016 in which the WWE World Heavyweight Championship was the prize of the match itself). With the introduction of the previous World Heavyweight Championship in 2002, the winner was also given the option to choose between it or the WWE Championship. The creation of the ECW brand in June 2006 gave the Rumble winner a third option, the ECW Championship. This option was made available from 2007 until the brand was retired in 2010; however, the title was never chosen. The brand split ended in 2011 and the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships were unified in 2013, leaving the former as the only title to challenge for until the reintroduction of the brand split in 2016, which added the WWE Universal Championship as a choice. After it and the WWE Championship were unified as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania 38 in 2022, the undisputed title became the only choice in 2023, but with the introduction of a new World Heavyweight Championship following that year&#x27;s WrestleMania 39, there is once again two choices: the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship. A women&#x27;s Royal Rumble match was introduced in 2018, with the winner receiving the option of challenging for either the WWE Raw Women&#x27;s Championship or WWE SmackDown Women&#x27;s Championship, which were renamed as the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship and Women&#x27;s World Championship, respectively, in June 2023. NXT&#x27;s championships, the NXT Championship and NXT Women&#x27;s Championship, became additional choices in 2020, but were dropped as choices in 2022 after NXT reverted to its original status as WWE&#x27;s developmental brand in September 2021.

WrestleMania 21 saw the introduction of the Money in the Bank ladder match. This match features six to ten participants and took place at six WrestleManias between 2005 and 2010 before becoming the headline match of its own pay-per-view event, Money in the Bank which incorporated the use of two Money in the Bank ladder matches for both respective WWE brands, Raw and SmackDown (since 2017, two matches have been held at the titular event, but one each for the men and women, with participants divided between the brands). The participant who retrieves the briefcase suspended above the ring wins a contract, which guarantees a world title match at the time and place of the winner&#x27;s choosing for up to one year, including the following year&#x27;s WrestleMania. This lasted until 2010 when the Money in the Bank pay-per-view was introduced and thus the Money in the Bank ladder match was retired from WrestleMania.

Forbes named WrestleMania one of the world&#x27;s most valuable sports event brands from 2014 to 2019, ranking it sixth with a brand value of US$245 million in 2019 behind the Super Bowl, Summer Olympics, NCAA Final Four, the FIFA World Cup, and the College Football Playoffs.

===Commentators===

For five of the first six WrestleManias, Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura served as the color commentators (the exception being WrestleMania 2, which was split among three venues and had Monsoon, Ventura, and Vince McMahon split up with guest commentators), while Bobby Heenan, Gene Okerlund, Lord Alfred Hayes, and others filled guest roles. For WrestleMania VII and VIII, Monsoon and Heenan provided color commentary. In the mid to late 1990s, the commentator team comprised Vince McMahon, Jim Ross, and Jerry Lawler. Since the brand separation in 2002, matches from the Raw brand have been called by Ross and Lawler; the SmackDown matches called by Michael Cole, Tazz, John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield, and Jonathan Coachman, and from 2006 to 2010, the ECW matches called by Joey Styles and Tazz. At WrestleMania 25, the first three-man inter-brand commentary team since the brand extension was introduced was used and consisted of Jim Ross, Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler, and Michael Cole. The following year at WrestleMania XXVI, Jim Ross was replaced by Matt Striker. At WrestleMania XXVII, Jim Ross returned to commentate, along with Josh Mathews and new &quot;SmackDown&quot; color commentator Booker T; the sudden change of commentary was due to a singles match between regular commentators Michael Cole and Lawler. Howard Finkel, who is credited with coming up with the name &quot;WrestleMania&quot; in 1984, has served as the long-standing ring-announcer and has appeared at every event except WrestleMania 33, but since the introduction of the WWE brand extension, Lilian Garcia, Tony Chimel, and Justin Roberts took over as announcers for their respective brand&#x27;s matches. Four French commentators were at ringside: Jean Brassard and Raymond Rougeau (WrestleMania 13), Phillippe Chéreau, and Christophe Agius (WrestleMania XXX, WrestleMania 31, WrestleMania 32, and WrestleMania 33).

==History==

===1980s===
The World Wrestling Federation staged the first WrestleMania on March 31, 1985, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The main event was a tag-team match between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and Mr. T, accompanied by Jimmy Snuka against the team of Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff, who were accompanied by Cowboy Bob Orton. The financial and critical success of the event secured the company&#x27;s status as the most successful professional wrestling promotion in the United States, rising above competitors such as the National Wrestling Alliance and American Wrestling Association. In attendance were business celebrity Sy Sperling and broadcasting executive Tony D&#x27;Angelo. WrestleMania 2 was held the following year and took place in three venues across the country. The Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, the Rosemont Horizon (now Allstate Arena) in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois, and the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles. They each featured multiple matches that led up to the main event; this saw WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan defeat King Kong Bundy in a Steel Cage match.

A world indoor attendance-record of 93,173 fans was set at WrestleMania III, which was also the largest paying attendance in the history of professional wrestling at the time. The event is widely considered to be the pinnacle of the 1980s wrestling boom. To make certain that every seat in the Pontiac Silverdome would be filled, WWF decided to exclude the entire state of Michigan from pay-per-view access to the event, which made attending the event the only way for fans in Michigan to see it. The event featured Hulk Hogan defending the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against André the Giant and the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship match between &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage and Ricky &quot;The Dragon&quot; Steamboat. The match between Savage and Steamboat would go on to be regarded as one of the greatest matches in WrestleMania history and is acknowledged by many (including Vince McMahon) as having &quot;stolen the show&quot;.

WrestleMania IV was held at the Atlantic City Convention Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey (though on the broadcast it was billed as being held in the Trump Plaza because the adjacent casino hotel was the event&#x27;s primary sponsor). The event was an all-tournament event to crown a new WWF World Heavyweight Champion, with four non-tournament matches to fill between the gaps in the tournament rounds. The second round of the tournament featured a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s main event between Hulk Hogan and André the Giant while Randy Savage went on to defeat Ted DiBiase in the finals to win the championship.

The next event, WrestleMania V, returned the event to Atlantic City, in which Hulk Hogan defeated Randy Savage for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which Savage had won the previous year. To date, this is the only time consecutive WrestleManias were held in the same venue. The event also saw the WrestleMania in-ring debut of Shawn Michaels, who would later go on to earn the moniker &quot;Mr. WrestleMania&quot;.

===1990s===
The first time WrestleMania took place outside of the United States was WrestleMania VI, which was held at the SkyDome (now Rogers Centre) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In the main event match, The Ultimate Warrior won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hulk Hogan. The following year, the event returned to the United States for WrestleMania VII, which was originally scheduled to be held at the outdoors Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The event was moved to the adjacent indoors Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena after poor ticket sales, sold on television as being for security reasons related to the Gulf War and Sgt. Slaughter&#x27;s storyline defection to Iraq. The event saw Hulk Hogan face defending champion Sgt. Slaughter for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, while The Undertaker made his WrestleMania debut, defeating Jimmy Snuka. Following this, The Undertaker went undefeated in 21 of his WrestleMania matches until he lost to Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania XXX in 2014. The next edition, WrestleMania VIII, was held in the Hoosier Dome with &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage defeating Ric Flair for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and Hulk Hogan defeating Sid Justice via disqualification.
WrestleMania IX was the first WrestleMania held at an outdoor venue. It was also the first and only time in WrestleMania history that the WWF World Heavyweight Championship switched twice. Yokozuna defeated Bret Hart to become the WWF World Heavyweight Champion, only to lose it to Hulk Hogan in an impromptu match. WrestleMania X saw the event&#x27;s return to Madison Square Garden. The event featured Owen Hart defeating his elder brother Bret; a ladder match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship also headlined, in which Razor Ramon defeated Shawn Michaels. Bret having been defeated earlier won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Yokozuna in the main event. Bret is the first wrestler in WrestleMania history to lose his first match and come back to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. After failing to capture the title from Diesel at WrestleMania XI, Michaels defeated Bret Hart to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in a 60-minute Iron Man match at WrestleMania XII. The match was widely praised. The event also saw the return of the Ultimate Warrior, who defeated Hunter Hearst Helmsley (later known as Triple H) in the latter&#x27;s WrestleMania debut.

At WrestleMania 13, a submission match pitted Bret Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin against one another in a bout that received much acclaim, and The Undertaker defeated Sycho Sid for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. The match between Hart and Austin is considered by many fans as one of the best professional wrestling matches of all time and has been voted by IGN as the greatest match in WrestleMania history, and was number 1 among their list of top 20 WrestleMania matches of all time. Various other sources also names the match as the greatest WrestleMania match of all time.

At WrestleMania XIV, Austin defeated Shawn Michaels to become the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion in a match that featured Mike Tyson serving as the special enforcer. Although Tyson had been aligned with Michaels and his stable D-Generation X, Tyson revealed to have been aligned with Austin all along as he personally counted the pinfall and declared Austin the winner. The Undertaker and Kane fought for the first time at this event where The Undertaker won. The following year at WrestleMania XV, Austin defeated The Rock to regain the WWF Championship. The event featured the first of three encounters at WrestleMania between Austin and The Rock in a rivalry of the two most prominent and popular stars of the Attitude Era.

===2000s===
WrestleMania 2000 featured the first-ever Triangle Ladder match for the WWF Tag Team Championship, involving The Hardy Boyz (Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy), The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley), and Edge and Christian. The main event featured WWF Champion Triple H successfully defend his title in a fatal four-way match against The Rock, Big Show, and Mick Foley. This match was billed as having &#x27;a McMahon in every corner&#x27; as Triple H was accompanied by Stephanie McMahon, The Rock by Vince McMahon, Big Show by Shane McMahon, and Mick Foley by Linda McMahon.

At WrestleMania X-Seven, Stone Cold defeated The Rock and regained the WWF Championship. The event also featured Vince and Shane McMahon in a Street Fight, while Edge and Christian won the WWF Tag Team Championship against the Hardy Boyz and Dudley Boyz in the second Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. The event was the pinnacle of the 1990s wrestling boom. It was also the first WrestleMania held after the dissolution and WWF&#x27;s subsequent purchase of the company&#x27;s rival, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the end of the Monday Night War. The event was highly praised. In 2013, WWE released a list of their &quot;15 best pay-per-views ever&quot;, with WrestleMania X-Seven ranked at number one.

WrestleMania X8 was the last WrestleMania to be produced under the WWF name, and featured Triple H defeating Chris Jericho to win the Undisputed WWF Championship. Austin, The Rock, and The Undertaker defeated Scott Hall, Hulk Hogan, and Ric Flair respectively, all of whom had rejoined the company after their stints with WCW. Also, Rob Van Dam won his first Intercontinental Championship in his WrestleMania debut.

WrestleMania XIX, which was the first after the company was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), saw Stone Cold&#x27;s last match, as he faced The Rock for a third time at WrestleMania, ending their long-running feud. Additionally, Hulk Hogan defeated Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels participated in his first WrestleMania match in five years, defeating Chris Jericho. The World Heavyweight Championship (2002–2013 version) was defended for the first time at the event, with Triple H retaining against Booker T, while Brock Lesnar defeated Kurt Angle to win the WWE Championship.

WWE celebrated the 20th edition of WrestleMania at Madison Square Garden with WrestleMania XX. The event featured The Undertaker (who returned to his Deadman persona) defeating the unmasked Kane in their second encounter and the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship victories of Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit, respectively, with Guerrero defeating Kurt Angle to retain the WWE Championship and Benoit defeating Triple H and Shawn Michaels to win the World Heavyweight Championship. The event also featured the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection (The Rock and Mick Foley) versus Evolution (Batista, Randy Orton, and Ric Flair) in a 2-on-3 handicap match, which was The Rock&#x27;s last match for over seven years, as well as Stone Cold as the guest referee in an inter-promotional singles match between the departing superstars Brock Lesnar (who would return to the company eight years later) and Goldberg (who would return 12 years later). The WWE Hall of Fame was also reintroduced and became an annual induction show held the night before or week of WrestleMania.

At WrestleMania 21, the concept of the Money in the Bank ladder match was introduced; a six-man ladder match that featured a briefcase suspended above the ring containing a contract that guaranteed the winning Raw brand participant a world title match at any time and place of their choosing within one year up to the next year&#x27;s WrestleMania, in which Edge went on to win this match. In the main events, the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship passed on to John Cena and Batista, respectively, by defeating John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield and Triple H in their respective matches. Eddie Guerrero&#x27;s last WrestleMania match took place at WrestleMania 21 against Rey Mysterio, before he died later that year. The event also featured the return of &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin after a year-long hiatus, while Kurt Angle defeated Shawn Michaels in a highly acclaimed match.

The Money in the Bank ladder match was also held at WrestleMania 22 as a six-man interpromotional match where the winner would get a world title match of their choosing, regardless of the brand they were on, with this match was won by Rob Van Dam. The main events of WrestleMania 22 featured Rey Mysterio win the World Heavyweight Championship against Kurt Angle and Randy Orton in a Triple Threat Match, and John Cena retained the WWE Championship against Triple H. Edge defeated Mick Foley in a Hardcore Rules match, where Edge infamously speared Foley off the ring apron through a flaming table at ringside. WrestleMania 22 also featured Shawn Michaels defeating Vince McMahon in a No Holds Barred match, Undertaker defeating Mark Henry in a casket match, and Mickie James defeat Trish Stratus to win the original WWE Women&#x27;s Championship.

At WrestleMania 23, the Money in the Bank match expanded to include eight men and would include stars from the new ECW brand, which was won by Mr. Kennedy. John Cena would go on to retain his WWE Championship against Shawn Michaels, while The Undertaker would win the World Heavyweight Championship from Batista. Representing Donald Trump, ECW World Champion Bobby Lashley defeated Umaga, who represented Vince McMahon, in a match billed as the &quot;Battle of the Billionaires&quot; and arbitrated by &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin. This was also the last WrestleMania where the original WWE Women&#x27;s Championship was defended when Melina defeated Ashley Massaro in a lumberjills match.

At WrestleMania XXIV, Shawn Michaels defeated Ric Flair in a highly acclaimed retirement match, while the Money in the Bank ladder match included seven participants from all three brands which was won by CM Punk, who would also win the match again at WrestleMania 25. The ECW Championship was defended for the only time at a WrestleMania event, when Kane emerged as the new champion in a record 8 seconds, while Randy Orton retained the WWE Championship and The Undertaker won the World Heavyweight Championship for the second consecutive year, defeating Edge. In an encounter that featured major media coverage, boxing world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. defeated Big Show. The event was the second WrestleMania to be held at an outdoor venue. This was also the last WrestleMania event of the Ruthless Aggression era since later on in Mid-2008 the era ended as the WWE shifted towards a more &quot;kid-friendly&quot; product.

WrestleMania 25 featured Chris Jericho defeating WWE Hall of Famers Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, and Ricky Steamboat in a match that featured appearances by Ric Flair and actor Mickey Rourke. Shawn Michaels unsuccessfully attempted to hand The Undertaker his first defeat at a WrestleMania in a critically acclaimed match, which received the 2009 Match of the Year award by both Pro Wrestling Illustrated and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. The WWE Intercontinental Championship was defended at the event for the first time since WrestleMania X8 with Rey Mysterio defeated John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield. John Cena defeated Edge for the World Heavyweight Championship also involving the Big Show, while Triple H retained the WWE Championship against Randy Orton.

===2010s===
At WrestleMania XXVI, the professional wrestling career of Shawn Michaels came to an end as he faced The Undertaker in a highly acclaimed re-match of their encounter from the previous year. The event also featured John Cena winning the WWE Championship and Chris Jericho retaining the World Heavyweight Championship. Following Bret Hart&#x27;s return to WWE in over twelve years since the Montreal Screwjob incident, Bret Hart defeated Vince McMahon in a No Holds Barred match with members of the Hart wrestling family present. The Money in the Bank ladder match included ten participants from both Raw and SmackDown (the ECW brand was retired in February), and this match was won by Jack Swagger. This was the last Money in the Bank ladder match to be held at a WrestleMania event due to the creation of the Money in the Bank pay-per-view in July that year.
WrestleMania XXVII featured the return of The Rock following a seven-year hiatus to serve as host for the event. Trish Stratus competed in her first WrestleMania since WrestleMania 22, teaming with John Morrison and &quot;Jersey Shore&quot;″s Nicole &quot;Snooki&quot; Polizzi to defeat LayCool and Dolph Ziggler. Longtime WWE announcers Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler brawled in a match officiated by &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin, while Triple H failed in his attempt to avenge Shawn Michaels&#x27; loss to The Undertaker from a year prior. This was the first WrestleMania in history in which both the World Heavyweight Champion and WWE Champion were able to successfully retain their titles. World Heavyweight Champion Edge defeated the challenger Alberto Del Rio in what would be Edge&#x27;s last match before his retirement on April 11, and The Rock closed out the event saluting the fans after laying out John Cena and The Miz with his signature move, the Rock Bottom, following Miz retaining the WWE Championship. This incident would set up the main event for the following year&#x27;s WrestleMania.

WrestleMania XXVIII had three matches in the upper card. In the first main event, The Undertaker defeated Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match via pinfall, officiated by Shawn Michaels and extending his WrestleMania streak to 20–0. The second main event featured CM Punk retaining the WWE Championship against Chris Jericho, via submission. The third main event featured The Rock defeating John Cena via pinfall in a &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; match, announced a year in advance.

In 2013, WrestleMania 29 had 80,676 fans in attendance, becoming the third-highest attended WrestleMania ever. This WrestleMania had three main events. The first saw The Undertaker extend his undefeated streak to 21–0 by defeating CM Punk. Triple H, with the help of Shawn Michaels, defeated Brock Lesnar in a No Holds Barred match; had Triple H lost, he would have had to retire from in-ring competition. In the final match, John Cena avenged his loss from the previous year by defeating The Rock for the WWE Championship, winning the title a record 11th time and setting a record of four victories as a challenger in a world title match at WrestleMania. Other matches included Alberto Del Rio successfully defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Jack Swagger, and Fandango pulling off an upset win over veteran Chris Jericho. In the opening bout, The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns) defeated the team of Big Show, Sheamus, and Randy Orton in their WrestleMania debut.

WrestleMania XXX was the 30th annual WrestleMania event produced by WWE on April 6, 2014, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The event was the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Louisiana. It saw Daniel Bryan defeat Triple H in the opening match. Per the stipulation, this gave Bryan a spot in the main event, where he won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by making Batista submit in a triple threat match which also included Randy Orton. It was the only WrestleMania where the WWE Divas Championship was defended, with AJ Lee retaining the title in the &quot;Vickie Guerrero Divas Championship Invitational&quot;. WrestleMania XXX also saw the end of The Undertaker&#x27;s undefeated streak at WrestleMania as he was defeated by Brock Lesnar in what was described as &#x27;the most shocking result in sports-entertainment history&#x27;. At WrestleMania XXX, Bray Wyatt&#x27;s undefeated streak since his debut came to an end at the hands of John Cena. Also, at WrestleMania XXX, The Shield defeated Kane and The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) in a six-man tag team match, and Cesaro won the first-ever André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal by body-slamming Big Show over the top rope in similar fashion to Hulk Hogan bodyslamming André the Giant at WrestleMania III.

WrestleMania 31 was held at Levi&#x27;s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on March 29, 2015. Brock Lesnar defended the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in the main event against Royal Rumble winner Roman Reigns, with Seth Rollins cashing in his Money in the Bank briefcase, turning the bout into a Triple Threat, ending with Rollins pinning Reigns to win the championship. Other main bouts included Sting&#x27;s first-ever WWE match against Triple H, which he lost, The Undertaker returned and defeated Bray Wyatt to get his 22nd victory at the event&#x27;s history, Randy Orton defeated Seth Rollins and Rusev lost the United States Championship and his unbeaten streak to John Cena. Another important promoted match was the 7-man ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship, which was won by Daniel Bryan. Also at WrestleMania 31, AJ Lee teamed with Paige to defeat The Bella Twins (Brie Bella and Nikki Bella) in a tag team match, while Big Show won the second annual Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, by last eliminating Damien Mizdow.

WrestleMania 32 was held at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on April 3, 2016. WrestleMania 32 broke the attendance record at 101,763 as announced by The Rock at the event. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Triple H to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Other bouts included the Undertaker defeating Shane McMahon in a Hell in a Cell match. Had Shane won, he would have gained control of &quot;Raw&quot;, while had Undertaker lost, this would have been his last WrestleMania. Brock Lesnar defeated Dean Ambrose in a No Holds Barred Street Fight, Charlotte defeated Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks to win the inaugural WWE Women&#x27;s Championship, Chris Jericho defeated AJ Styles in a singles match, The League of Nations (Sheamus, Rusev, and Alberto Del Rio) (with King Barrett) defeated The New Day (Xavier Woods, Kofi Kingston, and Big E) in a six-man tag match, Zack Ryder won a 7-man ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship, and The Rock defeated Erick Rowan in a record-breaking 6-second match. Also at WrestleMania 32, Baron Corbin won the third annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, by last eliminating Kane.

WrestleMania 33 took place on April 2, 2017, at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. It was the first WrestleMania since WrestleMania 29 in 2013 to feature two world championships on the line: Raw&#x27;s Universal Championship, defended for the first time at WrestleMania, and SmackDown&#x27;s WWE Championship. The main event saw Roman Reigns defeat The Undertaker in a No Holds Barred match giving Undertaker his second loss at WrestleMania. Elsewhere on the event&#x27;s card, Brock Lesnar defeated Goldberg in a rematch from WrestleMania XX to become the new Universal Champion, Randy Orton defeated Bray Wyatt to win his ninth WWE Championship, and Mojo Rawley won the fourth annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal by last eliminating Jinder Mahal. The event also marked the unannounced return of The Hardy Boyz, who won the Raw Tag Team Championship at the event in a fatal four-way tag team ladder match.

WrestleMania 34 was held on April 8, 2018, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. In the main event, Brock Lesnar retained the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns. In another main event promoted match, AJ Styles retained the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. Other marquee matches saw Kurt Angle and Ronda Rousey defeat Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in a mixed tag team match, which was Rousey&#x27;s WWE debut match, and Daniel Bryan had his in-ring return after three years, teaming with Shane McMahon to defeat Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn. Also, The Undertaker defeated John Cena in an impromptu match. In another prominent match, Charlotte Flair retained the SmackDown Women&#x27;s Championship against Asuka, ending Asuka&#x27;s two-year undefeated streak, and Nicholas, a 10-year old fan, became the youngest champion in WWE history when he teamed with Braun Strowman to defeat Cesaro and Sheamus for the Raw Tag Team Championship, The SmackDown Tag Team Championship was also defended for the first time at WrestleMania, where The Bludgeon Brothers (Harper and Rowan) defeated The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) and The New Day to win the titles, Matt Hardy last eliminated Baron Corbin to win fifth André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal as well as first-ever WrestleMania Women&#x27;s Battle Royal contested where Naomi won by last eliminating Bayley.
WrestleMania 35 was held on April 7, 2019, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. At the event, Kofi Kingston became the first African-born WWE Champion after defeating Daniel Bryan, while Seth Rollins defeated Brock Lesnar to win the Universal Championship. The event also saw the retirement of veteran WWE stars Kurt Angle and Batista. For the first time, the main event of WrestleMania was a women&#x27;s match, with Raw Women&#x27;s Champion Ronda Rousey, SmackDown Women&#x27;s Champion Charlotte Flair, and Becky Lynch facing off in a Winner Takes All Triple Threat match for both championships, in which Lynch emerged victorious.

===2020s===
For the first time in WrestleMania&#x27;s history, WrestleMania 36 was taped and held across two nights. The tapings occurred on March 25 and 26, 2020, at multiple locations including the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. It then aired on tape delay on April 4 and 5. It was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5 at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, and to air live, but was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was only attended by essential personnel, and was the first WWE pay-per-view event unattended by fans. It was the first WrestleMania to promote the NXT brand, which was formerly WWE&#x27;s developmental brand, but this would be the only to promote NXT as the brand was not featured at the next WrestleMania and it returned to being the developmental brand in September 2021. In the main event for Part 1 of WrestleMania 36, The Undertaker defeated AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was produced as a cinematic match and was one of two matches not filmed at the Performance Center—this would in turn be The Undertaker&#x27;s final match. Braun Strowman also defeated Goldberg to win the Universal Championship while Becky Lynch retained the Raw Women&#x27;s Championship over NXT&#x27;s Shayna Baszler. In the main event for Part 2, Drew McIntyre defeated Brock Lesnar to win the WWE Championship; after the show went off the air, a dark match occurred wherein McIntyre retained the title over Big Show in a match described by WWE as the &quot;hidden WrestleMania main event&quot; (which was shown on the April 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;). Also on the show, &quot;The Fiend&quot; Bray Wyatt defeated John Cena in a Firefly Fun House match, which was the other match not filmed at the Performance Center and also produced as a cinematic match, and Charlotte Flair defeated Rhea Ripley to win the NXT Women&#x27;s Championship, which was the first and thus far only time an NXT title was defended at WrestleMania. Also on Part 2, Edge had his first singles match since 2011 in which he defeated Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. Following this, WrestleMania would become a two-night event.

WrestleMania 37 took place on April 10 and 11 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, the original location of WrestleMania 36, to allow for fan attendance—making it the first WWE event to have ticketed fans in attendance during the pandemic, though to a limited capacity of 25,000 for each night. In the main event for WrestleMania 37 Night 1, Bianca Belair defeated Sasha Banks to win the SmackDown Women&#x27;s Championship, which was the first time two African Americans headlined WrestleMania. Also on the card, Bobby Lashley defeated Drew McIntyre by technical submission to retain the WWE Championship and celebrity Bad Bunny teamed with Damian Priest and defeated The Miz and John Morrison. In the main event of Night 2, Roman Reigns retained the Universal Championship against Edge and Daniel Bryan in a triple threat match.

WrestleMania 38 took place on April 2 and 3, 2022, at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. As most COVID-19 restrictions had been lifted by that point, this was the first full capacity WrestleMania since 2019, and established a new format for WrestleMania Weekend—a special live &quot;WrestleMania SmackDown&quot; featuring the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal (a recent WrestleMania night staple) immediately followed by the WWE Hall of Fame inductions, and then NXT holding its now annual WrestleMania event, Stand &amp; Deliver, the afternoon of Night 1, and then followed by &quot;Raw After WrestleMania&quot; on Monday. At WrestleMania 38 itself, Cody Rhodes returned as Seth Rollins&#x27; &quot;mystery opponent&quot;, defeating Rollins in Night 1. In the main event of Night 1, &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin came out of retirement for a one match return to defeat Kevin Owens. In the main event of Night 2, Roman Reigns defeated Brock Lesnar in a Winner Takes All match for the WWE Championship and WWE Universal Championship, becoming the first wrestler to hold both titles simultaneously and becoming recognized as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion, although both titles retained their individual lineages.
WrestleMania 39 took place on April 1 and 2, 2023, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California—the original location of WrestleMania 37 before the pandemic forced it to be relocated. As was established the previous year, the WrestleMania Weekend festivities included a live &quot;WrestleMania SmackDown&quot; (including the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal) immediately followed by the 2023 WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony on Friday March 31, then on the afternoon of Saturday April 1, NXT held their Stand &amp; Deliver event, all at the Crypto.com Arena in nearby Los Angeles, which also hosted the post WrestleMania edition of &quot;Raw&quot; on April 3. The main event of Night 1 of WrestleMania saw Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn defeat The Usos for the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Championship, marking the first time a tag team title match was the main event of a WrestleMania, and only the second time a tag team match was the main event, after WrestleMania I. The match was well received. It was also the first WrestleMania match since 1997 to earn a five stars rating from sports journalist Dave Meltzer. In Night 2&#x27;s main event, Roman Reigns retained the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship against Cody Rhodes, after Reigns&#x27; cousin Solo Sikoa interfered on his behalf.
WrestleMania XL took place on April 6 and 7, 2024 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Following precedent, the WrestleMania Weekend festivities included a live &quot;WrestleMania SmackDown&quot; (including the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal) immediately followed by the 2024 WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremony on Friday April 5, then on the afternoon of Saturday April 6, NXT held their Stand &amp; Deliver event, all at the Wells Fargo Center in Philly, which also hosted the post WrestleMania edition of &quot;Raw&quot; on Monday April 8. The main event of Night 1 saw The Bloodline (The Rock and Roman Reigns) defeat Cody Rhodes and Seth &quot;Freakin&quot; Rollins. This match determined the stipulation of Night 2&#x27;s main event. Since Rock and Reigns won, the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match was a Bloodline Rules match. Had Rhodes and Rollins won, all members of The Bloodline would have been barred from ringside during the championship match.
Night 2 witnessed a rematch from last years WrestleMania, as Cody Rhodes defeated Roman Reigns in the Bloodline Rules match to win the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship and end Reigns&#x27; generational 1,316 day-long title reign, following interference from Reigns&#x27; cousins Jimmy Uso, Solo Sikoa, and The Rock on his behalf, and Jey Uso, John Cena, Seth Rollins and The Undertaker on Rhodes&#x27; behalf. Other marquee matches during the two-night event saw Drew McIntyre defeat Rollins for the World Heavyweight Championship before Damian Priest cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and won the title from McIntyre, becoming only the second wrestler to successfully win a world championship after a cash-in at WrestleMania, and Sami Zayn defeating Gunther in Night 1 to end the latter&#x27;s 666-day reign as Intercontinental Champion. Also on the card, Rhea Ripley successfully defended the Women&#x27;s World Championship against Becky Lynch in the opening match of the first night, Jey Uso defeated his twin brother Jimmy Uso in Night 1, in only the third WrestleMania to feature a match between two real-life brothers after Owen Hart vs Bret Hart at WrestleMania X and Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy at WrestleMania 25, social media influencer and professional boxer Logan Paul beat Randy Orton and Kevin Owens in a triple threat match to retain the United States Championship on the second night, and Bayley defeating Iyo Sky in Night 2 for the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship to mark her first world title victory at WrestleMania.

WrestleMania 41 will take place on April 19 and 20, 2025, at Allegiant Stadium in the Las Vegas suburb of Paradise, Nevada. While still roughly in mid-April, this is the latest April date for a WrestleMania, which subsequently marks the first WrestleMania to be held during Easter weekend.

WrestleMania 42 will be held at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, marking the third WrestleMania in New Orleans and at the stadium, after WrestleMania XXX in 2014 and WrestleMania 34 in 2018. The event will be held on April 11 and 12, 2026. Additionally, a future WrestleMania will be held at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana as part of a partnership with the Indiana Sports Corp, which saw the 2025 Royal Rumble and will see a future SummerSlam held at the stadium.

==Celebrity involvement==
Over the years, WrestleMania has featured many celebrity appearances with varying levels of involvement. The main event of the first WrestleMania showcased numerous celebrities along with the wrestlers. Billy Martin served as ring announcer with Liberace as timekeeper, and Muhammad Ali served as an official. Mr. T competed in the main event alongside tag team partner, Hulk Hogan. WrestleMania 2 featured a 20-man battle royal pitting several NFL players against WWF wrestlers, while Lawrence Taylor defeated Bam Bam Bigelow in the main event of WrestleMania XI. Mike Tyson appeared at WrestleMania XIV as the special guest enforcer for the WWF Championship bout between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin, while professional boxer Butterbean was challenged to a boxing match by Bart Gunn at WrestleMania XV. At WrestleManias XIV, XV, and 2000, Pete Rose became involved in a short feud with Kane that became a running gag with each appearance ending with Rose receiving a Tombstone piledriver or chokeslam from Kane. Big Show faced sumo wrestling yokozuna Akebono in a sumo contest at WrestleMania 21, and fought professional welterweight boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. at WrestleMania XXIV. &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; star Nicole &quot;Snooki&quot; Polizzi competed in a 6-person tag team match teaming with Trish Stratus and John Morrison in a winning effort against Dolph Ziggler and LayCool (Layla and Michelle McCool), at WrestleMania XXVII.

The event has also featured live musical performances. Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, Willie Nelson, Reba McEntire, Little Richard, Boyz II Men, Ashanti, Boys Choir of Harlem, Michelle Williams, John Legend, Nicole Scherzinger, Fantasia Barrino, and Keri Hilson have each renditioned the songs &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; or &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; before the show. Robert Goulet performed &quot;O Canada&quot; at WrestleMania VI. Acts such as Motörhead, Limp Bizkit, Saliva, Run–D.M.C., Salt-n-Pepa, Living Colour, Ice-T, Drowning Pool, Flo Rida, P.O.D., Machine Gun Kelly, Rev Theory, Mark Crozer, and Snoop Dogg have also performed during the live entrances of competitors.

==WWE World at WrestleMania==
In 1988, in association with The Trump Organization, WWF prepared a small festival to celebrate WrestleMania IV, which included autograph signings, a brunch, and a 5K run; the event was held again in 1989 for WrestleMania V. In 1992, a festival was held the day of WrestleMania VIII which included a WWF superstar look-alike contest and a tournament for the &quot;WWF WrestleFest&quot; arcade game. In 1993, the WWF held a &quot;WrestleMania Brunch&quot; the day of WrestleMania IX at Caesars Palace, during the course of which Lex Luger attacked Bret Hart. In 1994, WWF offered &quot;Fan Fest&quot; for the weekend of WrestleMania X, which allowed fans to step inside a WWF ring, participate in games, meet superstars, and purchase merchandise; the event was followed up in 1995 with another &quot;Fan Fest&quot; for WrestleMania XI. For WrestleMania XV, a pre-event concert known as the &quot;WrestleMania Rage Party&quot; (in reference to that year&#x27;s theme, &quot;The Ragin&#x27; Climax&quot;) was held at the Pennsylvania Convention Center and televised by USA Network in an hour-long special, featuring performances by Isaac Hayes and Big Pun.

The following year WWF held its first &quot;WrestleMania Axxess&quot; event at the Anaheim Convention Center expanding upon the party idea of &quot;WrestleMania Rage Party&quot;. The event included autograph signings and mementos to inductees of the WWE Hall of Fame. There were also activities where fans could enter a wrestling ring and commentate a wrestling match. In 2001, &quot;WrestleMania Axxess&quot; was held at the Reliant Hall which expanded upon the event by adding numerous activities including areas where attendees could buy special merchandise, see a production truck and check out special WWE vehicles. From 2002, &quot;WrestleMania Axxess&quot; would be extended to a three-day event (March 14–16) and would be held at the Canadian National Exhibition. The three-day event included similar activities to that of the one-day line-up. 2003 would be the final WrestleMania Axxess at a convention center for 6 years. From 2004 to 2008, WrestleMania Axxess visited cities around the United States and Canada with a smaller touring version of what was previously presented at regular Axxess events. In 2009 WrestleMania Axxess returned, and had continued every year until 2020. It was held as a four-day event at convention centers and arenas in the host city of that year&#x27;s WrestleMania. The event was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Beginning with WrestleMania XL in April 2024, WWE relaunched the event under a new name of WWE World at WrestleMania as part of a partnership with Fanatics Events. The five-day event includes interview panel sessions with WWE wrestlers, a &quot;WWE 2K&quot; gaming tournament, live podcast recordings, meet-and-greets with wrestlers, and a large merchandise store with various memorabilia honoring WrestleMania&#x27;s history. Like with WrestleMania Access, WWE World is held at convention centers and arenas in the host city of that year&#x27;s WrestleMania.

<text>The Fokker F28 Fellowship is a twin-engined, short-range jet airliner designed and built by Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker.

Following the Fokker F27 Friendship, an early and commercially successful turboprop-powered regional airliner, Fokker decided to embark on developing a new turbofan-powered commuter aircraft that would build upon its experiences with the F27. During the design phase, a high level of attention was paid to market research and operator concerns; amongst other changes made, the prospective jetliner was increased in size, changing its maximum seating capacity from 50 to 65 passengers. During April 1962, Fokker announced the formal launch of the F28 Fellowship. The Fokker F28 directly competed with the American Douglas DC-9 and British BAC 1-11.

On 9 May 1967, the prototype F28-1000 conducted its maiden flight. On 24 February 1969, Kees van Meerten, Fokker Board member, received the Certificate of Airworthiness from Willem Jan Kruys, Director General of the Dutch National Aviation Authority. The first revenue-earning flight by Braathens was performed on 28 March 1969. Following its entry to service, Fokker developed multiple variants of the F28; one model, the F28-2000, featured an extended fuselage that could accommodate up to 79 passengers. A major revision was the F28-4000, which was powered by quieter Rolls-Royce Spey 555-15H engines, a redesigned cockpit, and a modified wing, and had a further increased seating capacity up to 85 passengers. During 1987, production of the type was terminated in favour of two newer derivatives, the Fokker 70 and the larger Fokker 100.

==Development==
By 1960, Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker was engaged in multiple programmes; these included military aircraft such as the Bréguet Br.1150 Atlantic and the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, as well as the commercially successful turboprop-powered F27 Friendship airliner. Around this time, British European Airways (BEA) released a specification that called for a high-speed regional airliner powered by turbofan engines. In response, Fokker took an interest in developing its own turbofan-powered short-haul airliner. According to aviation publication &quot;Flying&quot;, Fokker&#x27;s prospective jetliner design was heavily shaped by feedback and experiences from its existing customers of the F27, particularly those in the crucial North American market. As such, American design methodologies and preferences were incorporated, reportedly emphasising simplicity, as well as efforts to minimise both language and trade barriers.

During April 1962, Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker announced the launch of the F28 Fellowship. The programme was a collaborative effort conducted between a number of European companies, namely Fokker itself, West German aerospace companies Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) and VFW-Fokker, and Short Brothers of Northern Ireland. Substantial government funding was also invested in the project; reportedly, the Dutch government provided 50% of Fokker&#x27;s stake, while the West German government contributed 60% of the overall 35% German stake. Fokker had also approached several other aviation companies with offers of involvement, including France&#x27;s Sud Aviation and Britain&#x27;s Hawker Siddeley.

Initial design work centered on an aircraft capable of transport a maximum of 50 passengers across distances up to 1,650 km (1,025 mi), the design was later modified so that it could accommodate up to 65 seats in a five-abreast configuration, noticeably increasing its maximum takeoff weight, on the basis of market research. The enlarged aircraft was roughly comparable in capacity to that of the British Vickers Viscount, a successful turboprop airliner. The design was capable of speeds well in excess of turboprop-powered competitors, but retained a relatively low cruise speed in comparison to contemporary jet-powered designs, facilitating its use of a relatively straight low-mounted wing and achieving favourable low-speed characteristics as to enable the type&#x27;s use from 85% of existing airports used by the F27 and the ubiquitous Douglas DC-3. According to &quot;Flying&quot;, the tentative airliner could achieve double the productivity of the preceding F27, while the company itself referred to the jetliner as a complement to its turboprop-powered sibling.

At one stage of development, Fokker had reportedly intended for the F28 to be powered by a pair of Bristol Siddeley BS.75 turbofans. However, when Fokker wanted to open contract negotiations, Bristol Siddeley told them that engine was no longer available as the market was too small when they lost the BAC 1-11 project. Rival British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, put forward their Rolls-Royce Spey Junior, a simplified version of the Rolls-Royce Spey. From the first prototype onwards the type would be exclusively powered by various models of the Spey engine.

The responsibility for both design and production of the F28 was divided between the partner companies. Fokker designed and built the nose section, centre fuselage, and inner wing; MBB/Fokker-VFW constructed the forward fuselage, rear fuselage, and tail assembly; while Shorts designed and produced the outer wings. Final assembly of the Fokker F28 was at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands. At one point, American manufacturer Fairchild Aircraft had considered locally producing their own derivative of the F28, which was referred to as the Fairchild 228, but this ultimately did not reach production, with the company deciding to act as a distributor for the existing F28, instead. During 1987, production of the type was terminated in favour of two newer derivative airliners, the Fokker 70 and the larger 100; by this point, a total of 241 airframes had been constructed.

The F28-1000 prototype, registered PH-JHG, first flew on 9 May 1967, flown by Chief Test Pilot Jas Moll, Test Pilot Abe van der Schraaf, and Flight Engineer Cees Dik. Type certification from West German authorities was achieved on 24 February 1969, clearing the F28 to enter revenue service. While the first order for the type had been placed by German airline LTU, the first revenue-earning flight was conducted by Braathens, which eventually operated a fleet of five F28s, on 28 March 1969.

==Design==
The Fokker F28 Fellowship was a short-haul, twin-engined jetliner, sharing broad similarities to the British Aircraft Corporation&#x27;s BAC One-Eleven built in the UK and the first-generation Douglas DC-9 built in the US in terms of basic configuration, featuring a T-tail and engines mounted at the rear of the fuselage. The choice of a low-mounted wing, amongst other benefits, somewhat shielded the tail-mounted engines from the threat of foreign object damage. Fuel is stored within both the outer wing and the fuselage; additional pylon-mounted tanks could be installed for extended range operations if so required. The structure, which features a fail-safe design, is constructed using the same bonding techniques previously pioneered for the F27.

The F28 was equipped with wings that had a slight crescent angle of sweep. It uses conventional box construction, being built in two pieces separately spliced onto the fuselage. The wing was furnished with ailerons positioned near the tips, along with simplistic flaps that would be supplemented by the ailerons during landing approaches; all of the flight control surfaces were actuated via duplicated cabling and (except for the rudder) aerodynamically balanced. It was also fitted with a five-section lift-dumper that would only be operated after landing, it was decided to employ a lift-dumper rather than alternatives such as thrust reversers, as the designers felt that this arrangement would result in a reduction in both weight and maintenance workload. Excluding the use of thrust reversers also meant that the chance of the engines ingesting debris was lessened when being operated upon unpaved airstrips. The wing also had a fixed leading edge (although one experimental model had leading edge slats and these were offered as an option) and was deiced via bleed air drawn from the engines.

The F28 is powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines; dependent on model, these would be were capable of generating up to 9,850 lbf (43.9 kN) of thrust. While the feature was available at the time, Fokker chose not to equip the engines of early F28s with a water-methanol injection system, as they determined that the engines already possessed sufficient performance even when being flown under hot-and-high conditions. Most onboard systems are designed with simplicity in terms of operability and serviceability; no hydraulic system was used, as actuation of the undercarriage and steering relied on pneumatic pumps, instead. However, the F28 was outfitted with comparatively advanced electronics, as Fokker&#x27;s design team viewed this factor as directly relating to overall competitiveness.

One uncommon feature of the F28 was the movable split-sections installed on the tail cone; these would be hydraulically opened outwards to act as a variable air brake. A similar approach had also been used on the contemporaneous Blackburn Buccaneer strike fighter and on the later-built British Aerospace 146 regional airliner. The design is unique in that it not only slows the aircraft down rapidly, but also it can aid in rapid descents from economic cruising altitudes and also allowed the engines to be set at higher speeds, which helped eliminate lag time. This means the engines respond faster if needed for sudden speed increases or go-arounds on the approach to landing. The Fellowship had a retractable tricycle landing gear, which used large, low-pressure tyres, enabling the use of unpaved airstrips. The use of antiskid brakes on the main wheels of the undercarriage also contributed to a shorter landing run.

==Variants==


A variant of the F28, equipped with an extended fuselage, was named F28-2000; this model could seat up to 79 passengers instead of the 65 seats on the F28-1000. The prototype for this model was a converted F28-1000 prototype, and first flew on 28 April 1971. The models F28-6000 and -5000 were modified models of the F28-2000 and F28-1000, respectively; the main features of these models was the addition of slats, a greater wingspan, and the adoption of more powerful and quieter engines. Both the F28-6000 and -5000 failed to become commercial successes; only two F28-6000s and no F28-5000s were ultimately built. After being used by Fokker for a time, the F28-6000s were sold to Air Mauritanie, but not before being converted to F28-2000 standards.

Perhaps the most successful model of the F28 was the F28-4000, which debuted on 20 October 1976 with one of the world&#x27;s largest Fokker operators, Linjeflyg. This version was powered by quieter Spey 555-15H engines, and had an increased seating capacity (up to 85 passengers), a larger wingspan with reinforced wings, a new cockpit, and a new &quot;wide-look&quot; interior featuring enclosed overhead lockers and a less &#x27;tubular&#x27; look. The F28-3000, the successor to the F28-1000, featured the same improvements as the F28-4000.
: With a maximum capacity of 70 passengers, it was approved on 24 February 1969, the 1000C had a main-deck large cargo door.

;F.28 Mk 2000 (F28-2000)
: A Mark 1000 with a fuselage stretch of in front of and aft of the wing, 79 maximum passengers, it was approved on 30 August 1972. Though it first flew on 28 April 1971, and successfully began revenue service with Nigeria Airways in October 1971, only 10 were built.

;F.28 Mk 3000 (F28-3000)
: A Mark 1000 with a wingspan extension, it was approved on 19 July 1978, with a 3000C variant with a large main-deck cargo door.

===Undeveloped variants===
;F.28 Mk 5000 (F28-5000): This was to combine the shorter fuselage of the Mk 1000/3000 and an increased wingspan. Leading edge slats were to be added to the wings and more powerful Rolls-Royce RB183 Mk555-15H engines were to be used. Although expected to be an excellent plane to operate on short runways due to its superior power, the project was abandoned.

;F.28 Mk 6000 (F28-6000): It first flew on 27 September 1973, and had the longer fuselage of the Mk 2000/4000 with an increased wingspan and leading edge slats. It was certified in the Netherlands on 30 October 1975. Two were built by 1976.

;Fairchild 228: Proposed 50-seat American version to be assembled by Fairchild-Hiller with Rolls-Royce RB.203 Trent engines Project cancelled.

==Operators==
By 2019, no Fokker F28 aircraft remained in civil service.

Fly-SAX was the last airline operator of the F28 worldwide with the last aircraft in service stored in September 2019 due to lack of flight crew. Garuda Indonesia had the most F28s, with 62 of the aircraft in the former fleet. All have since been retired. Major operators included:Time Air/Canadian Regional (35 - second and third hand) MacRobertson Miller Airlines, Ansett Group Australia (more than 15), Toumaï Air Tchad (1), AirQuarius Aviation (3), SkyLink Arabia (1), Satena (1), Gatari Air Service (2), LADE (1), AirQuarius Aviation (4), Merpati Nusantara Airlines (1), and Biman Bangladesh Airlines (4). Some 22 airlines operated smaller numbers of the type. The F28s of Ansett Transport Industries&#x27; intrastate airline, MacRobertson Miller Airlines of Western Australia, flew the longest nonstop F28 route in the world, from Perth to Kununurra, in Western Australia – a distance of about 2,240 km (1,392 mi). This was also the world&#x27;s longest twin-jet route at the time. MMA&#x27;s F28&#x27;s also had the highest use rates at the time, flying over 8 hours per day.

===Current military/government operators===
* LADE (2)
* Colombian Air Force (2)
* Philippine Air Force - 1 Unit Active in 2024.

<text>Accelerated-X is a proprietary port of the X Window System to Intel x86 machines.

==History==
The Accelerated-X server is built on top of the X386 X server that was created by Thomas Roell for X11 Release 5. He founded a company in Colorado named Xi Graphics which still provides the Accelerated-X server.
The XFree86 project was created as a free alternative to what became the Accelerated-X server.

==Features==
Accelerated-X server provides an &quot;overlay mode&quot; on several graphics cards which allows running ancient, 256 color mode-only Unix alongside more modern applications on truecolor 24-bit displays.

It used to provide much better driver support (hardware acceleration, 3D and compatibility, especially on integrated graphics) than XFree86, at a time when the major graphics chipset vendors were not supporting Linux officially.

<doc id="384762" wikidata="Q7100794" url="?curid=384762" title="Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, an ordinance is a sacred rite or ceremony that has spiritual and symbolic meanings and act as a means of conveying divine grace. Ordinances are physical acts which signify or symbolize an underlying spiritual act; for some ordinances, the spiritual act is the finalization of a covenant between the ordinance recipient and God.

Ordinances are usually performed by the authority of the priesthood and in the name of Jesus Christ. The use of the term &quot;ordinance&quot; by adherents is distinct from the use of the term in other branches of Christian tradition, where &quot;ordinance (Christian)&quot; is often used to imply that the act is merely symbolic and does not convey grace. Latter Day Saint use of the term &quot;ordinance&quot; carries the same meaning as the term &quot;sacrament&quot; as used by other Christian denominations. Community of Christ-derived denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement also tend to refer to &quot;sacraments&quot; rather than &quot;ordinances&quot;.

Some ordinances—such as baptism, confirmation and the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper—are similar to those practiced by other Christian denominations. Other Latter Day Saint ordinances—including the endowment and sealings—are unique and usually performed within a Latter Day Saint temple.

==Saving ordinances==

Saving ordinances are those ordinances that are a requirement for exaltation. Most Latter Day Saints denominations see saving ordinances as necessary, but not sufficient, requirements for exaltation.

The following are examples of saving ordinances in most sects of the Latter Day Saint movement:

#Baptism: Performed by immersion at age eight or older. Baptism is seen as symbolic both of Jesus&#x27; death, burial and resurrection and is also symbolic of the baptized individual putting off of the natural or sinful man and becoming spiritually reborn as a disciple of Jesus.
#Confirmation and reception of the Gift of the Holy Ghost: Performed by laying hands on the head of a newly baptized member. Through confirmation, the initiate becomes an official member of the church and receives the &quot;gift of the Holy Ghost&quot;.
#Ordination to the Priesthood: In the Latter Day Saint movement, the priesthood is the power and authority of God given to man, including the authority to perform ordinances and to act as a leader in the church. Latter Day Saint theology has recognized at least three orders of priesthood: (1) the Aaronic priesthood, (2) the Melchizedek priesthood; and (3) the Patriarchal priesthood. Although these are different orders, they are all subsumed under the priesthood held by Jesus Christ, or the Melchizedek priesthood. For most of the history of the Latter Day Saint movement, only men have been ordained to specific offices in the priesthood, and most Latter Day Saint denominations still restrict their priesthood to men. However, some exceptions to this policy do exist, such as within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), a church founded by James J. Strang, and the Community of Christ, which began ordaining women to all of its priesthood offices in 1984.

==Saving temple ordinances==


In some Latter Day Saint churches, additional saving ordinances are performed in temples. These include the endowment, the washing and anointing, and sealings. Currently, only the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church)-derived and Cutlerite-derived denominations within the Latter Day Saints movement practice all three. Other Latter Day Saint denominations, such as Community of Christ-derived and Hedrickite-derived denominations do not perform any of them. Still other denominations, such Strangite-derived denominations, practice sealings but reject the washing and anointing and the endowment.
#Endowment: Referred to as a gift of &quot;power from on high&quot; by Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, although the purpose and meaning of the endowment varied during his lifetime. After 1842, the endowment usually consists of two phases: (1) an initiation, and (2) an instructional and testing phase. The initiation consisted of the washing and anointing, culminating in the clothing of the patron in a &quot;Garment of the Holy Priesthood&quot;. The instructional and testing phase of the endowment consisted of a scripted reenactment of Adam and Eve&#x27;s experience in the Garden of Eden. The instruction is punctuated with personal covenants, gestures, and a prayer circle around an altar. At the end of instruction, the initiate&#x27;s knowledge of symbolic gestures and keywords is tested at a &quot;veil&quot;, a symbolic final frontier for the initiate to face the judgment of Jesus, before entering the presence of God in the Celestial Kingdom.
#Marriage and sealing: An ordinance where individuals are married and sealed as husband and wife as an eternal family. Any children the couple may already have are sealed to the family and any children born into this marriage after sealing are also sealed into that family which will live together forever, if obedient to God&#x27;s commandments. Children that are brought into the family later, though not born into the family such as via adoption, can be sealed to the family later in a sealing ceremony without the need for the marriage portion. This ordinance is particularly performed by the LDS Church and branches of Mormon fundamentalism.
#Sealing to parents: For children born before a marriage and sealing is performed or who have been adopted into a family, this ordinance seals them into that family as if they had been born into a sealed family.

== Saving ordinances on behalf of the dead==

According to Latter Day Saint theology, ordinances can be performed vicariously (i.e., post-mortem) on behalf of any person who would desire to accept the ordinance but did not receive it. While some sects, such as the Hedrickite denominations, have rejected some or all vicariously performed ordinances, other denominations, such as the LDS Church, still perform the saving ordinances on behalf of their deceased ancestors. These are performed vicariously or by &quot;proxy&quot; on behalf of the dead, and church members believe that it is up to the deceased to accept or reject the offered ordinance in the spirit world. Since deceased persons no longer have an earthly existence, they are unable to directly participate in these &quot;saving&quot; ordinances themselves. The physical performance of these ordinances by proxy is seen as fulfillment of the requirement. As with living ordinances, ordinances for the dead are considered necessary but insufficient. It is believed that the spirits in the spirit world are offered the teachings of the full gospel of Jesus Christ and have the opportunity to accept or decline vicarious ordinances done on their behalf. Some LDS Church members refer to Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:29 regarding baptism for the dead as evidence that this was a religious practice of ancient tradition that has now been restored by the LDS Church.

==Non-saving ordinances==
Ordinances which are not a requirement for exaltation are referred to as non-saving ordinances. A non-saving ordinance may be performed on behalf of an individual many times; in practice, however, some non-saving ordinances are only performed once per individual. While not every denomination performs each of these ordinances, they can be found throughout Latter Day Saint theology.

#Animal sacrifice: The ordinance of animal sacrifice was instituted in the Strangite denominations, primarily as a part of Strangite celebration rituals. Although the chapter on &quot;Sacrifices&quot; in Strang&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Law of the Lord&quot; speaks of them as being offered for sins, the prohibition on such sacrifices contained in 3 Nephi 9:19–20, meant that Strang focused instead on sacrifice as an element of religious festivities, especially the commemoration of the coronation a king. The head of every house, from the king to his lowest subject, was to offer &quot;a heifer, or a lamb, or a dove. Every man a clean beast, or a clean fowl, according to his household.&quot;
#Anointing of the Sick/Administration to the Sick and Consecrating oil: A person who is physically ill, emotionally strained, or sick in any other way may request administration of this blessing or ordinance. The purposes to provide assurance of God&#x27;s care and concern and also of the church&#x27;s interest in that person. Often this included the anointing of the head of the person with consecrated oil, necessitating the ordinance of &quot;Consecrating oil&quot;.
#Calling: This ordinance requires that a person having responsibility over a unit or an auxiliary of the church prayerfully seek revelation to determine which individual is to fill particular responsibilities within that organization. If the individual agrees—and many persons wait to receive spiritual confirmation before agreeing—then the individual is &quot;called&quot; to the position.
#Dedication of a church building or a temple: This ordinance is performed after the building is completed or purchased; if a building undergoes extensive remodeling, this ordinance may be performed again.
#Dedication of a grave: This ordinance is performed immediately before the body is placed in the grave; it is usually performed only once.
#Dedication of a land or country for the preaching of the gospel: This ordinance is usually performed before or soon after missionaries begin to preach in a particular country; it is usually performed only once (but may be performed again if missionaries have not been in a particular country for an extended period of time); it is typically performed by an apostle.
#Foot washing: The ordinance of foot washing was instituted in the Rigdonite/Bickertonite denominations as a demonstration of personal humility. Members follow the ordinance of as described in four times a year, when members greet each other with a &quot;holy kiss&quot;, preferably on the cheek, to signify that they are greeting each other in the love of God, in accordance with the description given in the King James Version of the New Testament. The Rigdonite/Bickertonite denominations believes that this is a very important ordinance, citing Jesus&#x27; statement to Peter: &quot;If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.&quot;
#Hosanna Shout: An organized ritual of a congregation of shouting hosanna, as a recitation of praise to God, while waving a white handkerchief, and is usually performed as a ritual in the dedication of a Temple. It was first used as part in the dedication the Kirtland temple and was part of the Kirtland endowment ceremony.
#Naming and blessing a child: Typically this ordinance is performed shortly only once after a child&#x27;s birth in fulfillment of the commandment in the Doctrine and Covenants: &quot;Every member of the church of Christ having children is to bring them unto the elders before the church, who are to lay their hands upon them in the name of Jesus Christ, and bless them in his name.&quot; The purpose of the practice is twofold: to give a baby an official name and to provide an opportunity to give a blessing for the child&#x27;s spiritual and physical welfare.
#Patriarchal blessing/Evangelist&#x27;s blessing: A blessing or ordinance given normally once by a patriarch to a church member. Patriarchal blessings are modeled after the blessing given by Jacob to each of his sons prior to his death and are considered a gift of knowledge and strength of one&#x27;s coming challenges and blessings.
#Prayer circle: An antiphonic prayer around an altar, performed as part of the endowment and on other occasions, such among the Apostolic United Brethren and the True and Living Church of Jesus Christ of Saints of the Last Days, where prayer circles within temples, endowment houses, and homes are still common.
#Priesthood blessing (including father&#x27;s blessings): A prayer for healing, comfort or counsel given by a Melchizedek Priesthood holder, who lays his hands on the head of the person receiving the blessing.
#Rebaptism of faithful members: In late 1839, many who were already baptized members of the church, were rebaptised either to show a renewal of their commitment to the movement or as part of a healing ordinance. Some denominations, such as the Community of Christ, never performed this ordinance. While others, like the LDS church historically performed this ordinance, such as during the Mormon Reformation, but no longer do.
#Sacrament/Lord&#x27;s Supper: An ordinance in which participants eat bread and drink wine, water, or unfermented grape juice in remembrance of the body and blood of Jesus Christ. It is similar to the Eucharist in the Catholic Church, or communion in Protestant denominations. Normally, the sacrament is provided either every Sunday, on the first Sunday of each month, as part of the regular meeting, or other additional special occasions. Strictly speaking, this is a non-saving ordinance because a person could be exalted without ever having participated in the sacrament. However, individuals who have been baptized are expected to regularly participate in the sacrament.
#Setting apart: An ordinance where a person is formally chosen and blessed to carry out a specific calling or responsibility in the church. Once a person has accepted the responsibility of holding a calling and has been &quot;Sustained&quot; by the members of the church for that position, one or more priesthood holders &quot;set apart&quot; the person to serve in that calling, usually accomplish by giving the person a priesthood blessing by the laying on of hands.
#Shaking the dust from the feet: A cursing ordinance in which a priesthood holder leaves a curse instead of a blessing, by casting off the dust of their feet &quot;against them as a testimony, and cleansing your feet by the wayside.&quot; It was most often used against those who rejected the teachings of the church, or who failed to provide missionaries, with food, money, or shelter. Since the early-20th century, the practice has been rare.
#Ritual of the law of adoption: An ordinance practiced mainly between 1846 and 1894 in which priesthood men were sealed in a father–son relationship to other men who were not part of nor even distantly related to their immediate nuclear family. There is no surviving evidence that the &quot;law of adoption&quot; sealing practice was taught by Joseph Smith or his contemporaries prior to Smith&#x27;s death in 1844. However, adoptions appeared on the records of the Nauvoo Temple in 1846, and scholars generally assume that the practice was instituted by Brigham Young. Following an address on 8 April 1894 by Wilford Woodruff, the practice of the law of adoption ceased in the LDS Church. However, some denominations, such as the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ. (commonly referred to as the &quot;Gay Mormon Church&quot;), continue to perform the ritual of the law of adoption.
#Second anointing: An ordinance performed for a sealed couple, sealing them up to eternal life, and anointing them as kings and queens, priests, and priestesses. In the LDS Church it is also called the fulness of the priesthood, and is a rare, but currently practiced ordinance for live participants, and (less commonly) vicariously for deceased individuals, though, it is usually only given in absolute secrecy to a small number of members after a lifetime of service. The ordinance is also still performed by many Mormon fundamentalist groups.

<doc id="384764" wikidata="Q2882956" url="?curid=384764" title="Mizuho Bank">
<text>is the integrated retail and corporate banking unit of Mizuho Financial Group (; ). It is one of the largest financial services company in Japan with total assets of approximately $1.9 trillion USD in 2023, and considered one of Japan&#x27;s three so-called megabank groups, along with MUFG and SMBC. 

Mizuho Bank provides financial products and services to a wide range of clients, including individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, large corporations, financial institutions and public sector entities. The bank client base extends to 90% of Forbes Global 200 companies, and over 80% of the listed companies in Japan. Its headquarters is located in Otemachi, the prominent business district of Tokyo. With over 505 branches and offices in Japan, it is the only bank to have branches in every prefecture in Japan. The bank also operates from 110 offices in 40 countries.

The name &quot;Mizuho&quot; is an archaic Japanese term meaning &quot;golden ears of rice,&quot; deriving from the classical text &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; to describe Japan.

== History ==
Mizuho bank was established in a merger between three major Jappanese banks, Industrial Bank of Japan, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank in 2002. Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank was the successor organisation to Dai-Ichi Bank, the first Japanese bank established in 1873 by Shibusawa Eiichi, allowing Mizuho Bank to inherit the &quot;0001&quot; bank code in Japan. The 2002 merger resulted in Mizuho bank becoming the first bank in the world with $1 trillion in total assets, paving the way for other Japanese banks to merge into &quot;megabank&quot; groups, which supported global competitiveness of the Japanese financial industry in early 21st century. In 2013, it merged with Mizuho Corporate Bank, the group bank previously focused on corporate financing businesses. 

==Services==
Mizuho services include current accounts, domestic and international cash cards, international money transfers, credit cards, saving accounts, loans, and Internet banking. 

Mizuho is the designated bank for the Japanese lottery.

<text>The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA), doing business as MTA Bridges and Tunnels, is an affiliate agency of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that operates seven toll bridges and two tunnels in New York City. The TBTA is the largest bridge and tunnel toll agency in the United States by traffic volume. It generated more than $2.4billion in toll revenue from 335 million vehicles in 2023. , its operating budget was $596 million; the budget is funded through taxes and fees.

The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority was founded in 1933 as the Triborough Bridge Authority (TBA). The agency was named after its first crossing, the Triborough Bridge. The Triborough Bridge Authority was reorganized as the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority in 1946. It began using the name MTA Bridges and Tunnels in 1994. The TBTA also controlled several buildings such as the New York Coliseum and the East Side Airline Terminal, both of which have been demolished.

==Facilities==

The seven bridges are:

* Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, colloquially known by its previous name, the Triborough Bridge, is the agency&#x27;s flagship crossing, and its original namesake. It connects Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens, via Randalls and Wards Islands, and is named after the assassinated former United States Senator from New York, Robert F. Kennedy.
* Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, which connects the Bronx and Queens.
*Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which connects Brooklyn and Staten Island.
* Throgs Neck Bridge, which connects the Bronx and Queens.
* Henry Hudson Bridge, which connects Manhattan and the Bronx.
* Marine Parkway–Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge, which connects Brooklyn and the Rockaways in Queens. It is co-named after former Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Mets first baseman, and later Mets&#x27; manager, Gil Hodges.
* Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, which connects Broad Channel to the Rockaways, both in Queens.

The two tunnels are:

* Hugh L. Carey Tunnel (colloquially known by its former name, the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel), connects Brooklyn and Manhattan. It is named after former New York governor Hugh L. Carey.
* Queens–Midtown Tunnel, which connects Queens and Manhattan.


==History==
===Founding===
MTA Bridges and Tunnels was originally founded as the Triborough Bridge Authority (TBA), which was organized to head the construction of the Triborough Bridge. The structure had started construction in 1929 but stalled during the Great Depression due to a lack of funding. In February 1933, a nine-person committee applied to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) for a $150 million loan for projects in New York state, including the Triborough Bridge. While the RFC favored a loan for the Triborough project, the mayor at the time, John P. O&#x27;Brien, banned the RFC from giving loans to the city. Instead, O&#x27;Brien wanted to create a bridge authority to sell bonds to pay for the construction of the Triborough Bridge as well as for the planned Queens–Midtown Tunnel between Manhattan and Queens. Robert Moses, the New York City parks commissioner, also pushed the state legislature to create an authority to fund, build, and operate the Triborough Bridge.

A bill to create the TBA passed quickly through both houses of the state legislature, and was signed by Governor Herbert H. Lehman in April 1933. The bill included a provision that the authority could sell up to $35 million in bonds and fund the remainder of construction through bridge tolls. George Gordon Battle, a Tammany Hall attorney, was appointed as chairman of the new authority, and three commissioners were appointed. Battle resigned from the chairmanship in November 1933, citing ill health, and was replaced by Nathan Burkan. 

===Early years===
In its first year, the TBA was in turmoil: by January 1934, one of the TBA&#x27;s commissioners had resigned, and New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia was trying another TBA commissioner, John Stratton O&#x27;Leary, for corruption. As a result, Public Works Administration (PWA) administrator Harold L. Ickes refused to distribute parts of the RFC grant allotted to the Triborough Bridge, until the existing funds could be accounted for. After O&#x27;Leary had been removed, La Guardia appointed Moses to the open commissioner&#x27;s position, and Ickes gave the city $1.5 million toward the bridge&#x27;s construction. Robert Moses became the CEO and Secretary of the TBA in February 1934, after the removal of O&#x27;Leary from the Board; Moses was additionally appointed Chairman in November 1936, following Burkan&#x27;s death the previous June. 

Moses leveraged his leadership of the Triborough Bridge Authority, as well as the state and city positions he also held, to expedite the Triborough project. The Triborough Bridge opened on July 11, 1936. The TBA constructed a second bridge, the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, between the Bronx and Queens. Construction started in 1937 and the bridge opened on April 29, 1939, in time for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair in Queens. Moses had proposed a third bridge, the Brooklyn-Battery Bridge, on the site of what is now the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. The United States Department of War ultimately rejected the Brooklyn-Battery Bridge as an impediment to shipping, since it would obstruct access from the New York Harbor to the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

Under the chairmanship of Robert Moses, the agency grew in a series of mergers with four other agencies. In January 1940, as part of a deal to build an approach to the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, Moses proposed merging the New York City Parkway Authority, which operated the Henry Hudson, Marine Parkway, and Cross Bay Bridges. The City Parkway Authority was merged with the TBA in February 1940. The Parkway Authority had already been merged with the Henry Hudson Parkway Authority, which operated the Henry Hudson Bridge, and with the Marine Parkway Authority, which operated the Marine Parkway Bridge. 

This gave the TBA complete control of all parkways and toll bridges located entirely in New York City. The same bill revoked the TBA&#x27;s right to build a bridge from Brooklyn to the Battery. In 1945, with the pending merger of the Triborough Bridge Authority and the New York City Tunnel Authority, the former was renamed the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. The authority operated the Queens–Midtown Tunnel and was building the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. The merger was finalized in 1946. The TBTA completed the construction of the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, which opened to traffic in May 1950.

===Growth===
Generating millions of dollars in toll revenue annually, the TBTA easily became a powerful city agency, as it was capable of funding large capital projects. From the 1940s to the 1960s, the TBTA built the Battery Tunnel Parking Garage, Jacob Riis Beach Parking Field, the New York Coliseum, and the East Side Airlines Terminal.

Aside from toll crossings, one of the TBTA&#x27;s most profitable properties was the New York Coliseum, an office building and convention center at Columbus Circle in Manhattan. The complex cost $35 million to build, of which $26.5 million came from toll revenues collected by the TBTA. The Coliseum, which became the New York City&#x27;s major convention center, had a tax agreement with the city wherein the city government would collect a portion of the TBTA&#x27;s revenue rather than collect taxes on the Coliseum property. Within the first ten years of the Coliseum&#x27;s opening, the city had collected almost $9.1 million from the TBTA. This special tax arrangement continued until the property was sold in 1998.

The TBTA built two bridges in the 1960s. The Throgs Neck Bridge, a project to alleviate traffic on the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, started construction in 1957 and opened in January 1961. The long-planned Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which had been proposed as far back as the 1920s, started construction in 1959 and opened in November 1964. Because of higher-than-expected traffic on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, the TBTA built a second deck on the bridge in 1969.

===Merger with MTA===
In January 1966, New York City Mayor John Lindsay proposed merging the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), which operated buses and subways in New York City, with the TBTA to create the Metropolitan Commuter Transit Authority (MCTA). While Governor Nelson Rockefeller offered his &quot;complete support&quot; for Lindsay&#x27;s proposed unified transit agency, Robert Moses called the proposed merger &quot;absurd&quot; and &quot;grotesque&quot; for its unwieldiness. Lindsay then proposed a bill in the state legislature that would allow the mayor to appoint a majority of the members in the new city-run transportation agency, but this was rejected. 

In June 1966, Rockefeller announced his plans to expand the MCTA&#x27;s scope to create a new regional transit authority to encompass the existing MCTA, as well as the NYCTA and TBTA. Lindsay disagreed, saying that the state and city should have operationally separate transit authorities that worked in tandem. In early 1967, Rockefeller proposed merging the NYCTA and TBTA into the MCTA, as well as creating a $2.5 billion bond issue to fund transportation improvements. In May 1967, Rockefeller signed a bill that allowed the MCTA to oversee the mass transit policies of New York City-area transit systems and the TBTA by the following March.

Initially, the TBTA was resistant to the MCTA&#x27;s efforts to acquire it. Moses was afraid that the enlarged MCTA would &quot;undermine, destroy or tarnish&quot; the integrity of the TBTA, One source of contention was Rockefeller&#x27;s proposal to use TBTA tolls in order to subsidize the cheap fares of the NYCTA, since Moses strongly opposed any use of TBTA tolls for use by outside agencies. Moses agreed to merge the TBTA into the MCTA in March 1967, and he even campaigned in favor of the transit bond issue. In February 1968, the TBTA&#x27;s bondholders acquiesced to the MCTA&#x27;s merger proposal. The TBTA archives, including models of projects built and unbuilt, were transferred to the MTA Bridges and Tunnels Special Archive, at 2 Broadway.

In March 1968, the MCTA dropped the word &quot;Commuter&quot; from its name and became the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The MTA took over the operations of the other New York City-area transit systems as well as the TBTA. Moses was relieved from his job as chairman of the TBTA, although he was retained as a consultant. Moses stated that TBTA construction projects would reduce the MTA&#x27;s budget surplus through 1970. Surplus revenue, formerly used for new automobile projects, was then used to support public transportation.

Since the merger, more than $10billion has been contributed by the TBTA to subsidize mass transit fares and capital improvements for the New York City Transit, Long Island Rail Road, and Metro-North Railroad. The MTA Bridges and Tunnels trading name was adopted in 1994. The name Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority is still the legal name of the Authority.

==Law enforcement==
The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority employs fewer than 100 Bridge and Tunnel officers (BTOs). The last civil service exam for MTA Bridge and Tunnel Officer (list # 6091) was in 2007.

===Duties===
TBTA Officers perform various tasks concerning vehicular traffic, assisting stranded motorists, performing selected security duties at the nine intra-city crossings, as well as other miscellaneous duties.

The TBTA operates seven bridges and two tunnels, including:

*Triborough Bridge (connecting Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens)
*Bronx-Whitestone Bridge (the Bronx and Queens)
*Verrazano Narrows Bridge (Brooklyn and Staten Island)
*Throgs Neck Bridge (the Bronx and Queens)
*Henry Hudson Bridge (Manhattan and the Bronx)
*Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge (Brooklyn and Queens—Rockaway peninsula)
*Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge (Brooklyn and Queens—Rockaway peninsula)

and two tunnels:
*Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (Brooklyn and Manhattan)
*Queens Midtown Tunnel (Queens and Manhattan)

===TBTA officers===
TBTA Officers wear a uniform similar to other NYC law enforcement officers. They are NYS Peace Officers with limited authority under Article 2, §2.10, sub 20 of New York State Criminal Procedure Law.

===Officer killed on duty===
Bridge and Tunnel Officer Thomas K. Choi was struck by a vehicle on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge on October 20, 2013. He suffered severe head injuries and was left in a coma. He died one year later. Choi had served with the TBTA for 11 years.

==Tolls==
MTA Bridges and Tunnels collects the vast majority of its tolls through E-ZPass, an electronic toll collection system. E-ZPass was introduced at MTA Bridges and Tunnels crossings between 1995 and 1997.

===Open-road tolling===

In October 2016, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that tollbooths would be removed at all bridges to speed up traffic. Since September 2017, all MTA Bridges &amp; Tunnels facilities have collected tolls through open-road cashless tolling. Tollbooths previously in place have been dismantled, and drivers no longer pay cash at the crossings. Instead, cameras mounted onto new overhead gantries manufactured by TransCore collect the tolls. While some are located where toll booths were previously located, others are located at the opposite ends of the facilities. A vehicle without an E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.

Automatic number-plate recognition (ALPR) analysis is used to decode the image of the plate into alphanumeric data and the jurisdiction of issue. , the MTA B&amp;T&#x27;s ALPR system was unable to read temporary paper license plates. The system is subject to significant fraud from motorists who obstruct clear views of their license plates. Drivers caught with such plates risk a ticket for an obstructed, missing or unreadable license plate under Section 402 of New York Vehicle and Traffic Law, though these drivers have not been subject to criminal enforcement. Governor Cuomo&#x27;s 2020 proposed Executive Budget included an amendment to specify the use of a modified license plate to avoid tolls as misdemeanor theft-of-service, but the proposal was not included in the final bill.

The MTA has released no data detailing its losses to modified or obstructed license plates, even though the prevalence of such license plates may result in substantial revenue losses. However, it was theoretically possible for the MTA to have a toll collection rate of over 100 percent, because the $50 and $100 fines for late toll payments have been added to the sum of tolls collected, but not added to the sum of tolls incurred by drivers. This may obscure both sources of toll revenue and causes of toll revenue loss for the MTA. 

From December 2018 through November 2019, the MTA successfully collected 97.1 percent of all tolls incurred by drivers, with the lowest rate being 94.8 percent at the Cross Bay Bridge. The preponderance of obstructed or modified license plates in New York City may suggest substantial revenue losses due to that form of fraud. An audit performed by the New York State Comptroller in 2017 criticized the MTA for losses due to issues with reading, and obstruction of, license plates. The MTA&#x27;s response characterized this as part of &quot;leakage&quot; that is &quot;inherent in the process for any Cashless Tolling environment.&quot;

<doc id="384768" wikidata="Q4357024" url="?curid=384768" title="Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank">
<text>, abbreviated as , was one of the largest banks in the world during the latter third of the 20th century. It was created in 1971 by merger of Dai-Ichi Bank, Japan&#x27;s oldest bank, and Nippon Kangyo Bank, a state financial institution that granted long-term loans to industry and agriculture.

In 2000, it merged with Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan to form Mizuho Financial Group. In 2002, DKB&#x27;s corporate &amp; investment banking division was transferred to Mizuho Corporate Bank, while its retail banking division was transferred to Mizuho Bank.

== History ==

In 1971, Dai-ichi Bank and Nippon Kangyo Bank merged to form DKB, which instantly surpassed longtime leader the Fuji Bank as the largest Japanese bank measured by assets and deposit market share. DKB formed the core of the DKB Group (or Dai-Ichi Kangyo Group), the largest Japanese keiretsu in terms of the number of associated companies, and became the central bank of DKB Group.

Taking over Nippon Kangyo and Noko&#x27;s operation, DKB was the sole trustee of Takarakuji lottery, and was the only bank to have branches in every prefecture in Japan.

DKB executives worried about recurrence of the problem in their Teikoku Bank period, when the two former banks&#x27; employees were on bad terms each other. Therefore, they were particular about &quot;a merger of equals.&quot; DKB&#x27;s board of directors, for example, was always composed half-and-half of former Dai-ichi members and former NKB members. The board of directors installed the former two banks members alternately as the next chairperson and president.

These practices backfired however, only causing difficulty among the employees similar to Teikoku Bank&#x27;s case. Irrational personnel affairs prevented DKB from increasing revenue and profit. Although DKB had more assets than any other Japanese bank, its capabilities were inferior to high-performing banks such as Fuji, Sumitomo, Sanwa or Mitsubishi.

== Controversy ==

During the Japanese asset price bubble of the late 1980s, Japanese banks, including DKB, granted increasingly risky loans. Even worse, DKB financed not only high-risk companies but also yakuza, in order to invest in capital resources more easily than its competitors. Furthermore, loans to sōkaiya (corporate racketeers) amounted to 30 billion JPY.

After the bubble&#x27;s collapse, these bad loans were judged to be poor value for money. A raid by Tokyo prosecutors in 1997 impeaching of the loans to sōkaiya laid DKB open to public criticism. , former president and then chairperson of DKB, who faced severe pressure over a series of alleged misdeeds, committed suicide by hanging himself in his home.

DKB combined with Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan in 2000, forming Mizuho Financial Group. In 2002, DKB&#x27;s corporate &amp; investment banking division was transferred to Mizuho Corporate Bank and its retail banking division to Mizuho Bank respectively.

== Dai-Ichi Kangyo Credit Cooperative ==
The Dai-Ichi Kangyo name remains in use by a Shinjuku, Tokyo-based credit union, , which was founded as a credit union for Nippon Kangyo Bank employees during the Taisho era. It remains active in the Tokyo region with over 45,000 members, and uses a modified version of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank branding.

<doc id="384771" wikidata="Q3090316" url="?curid=384771" title="Introduction (House of Lords)">
<text>The introduction is a ceremony in the House of Lords of the United Kingdom by which a new member is &quot;introduced&quot; to the existing membership. Introductions in the Lords are more elaborate than those in the House of Commons.

==Origins==

Originally, the Sovereign created and invested new peers personally. The personal procedure, however, was abandoned during the 17th century, and in 1621 the House of Lords began the ceremony of introduction. The ceremony has evolved over the years, generally growing more complex. However, in 1998, the Select Committee on Introductions suggested several reforms, which were generally adopted.

==Introduced lords==

Ceremonial introductions were originally used for all new members of the House of Lords. However, in 1663, the House of Lords decided that peers who inherited a title did not need to be introduced. This applies to hereditary peers joining the House by virtue of by-elections under the House of Lords Act 1999. However, if hereditary peers receive life peerages, they must be introduced like any other life peer, unless they sat in the Lords before the House of Lords Act 1999.

The Lords Spiritual (twenty-six bishops of the Church of England who sit in the House of Lords) are also introduced, though by a different ceremony, upon appointment. Also, if a Lord Spiritual is &quot;translated&quot; (transferred) to another see, they must be reintroduced.

==Lords Temporal ceremony==

The ceremony of Introduction used prior to 1998 was much more complicated than the present ceremony. Originally, the Lord Chancellor in court dress (including a tricorn hat), or a Deputy Speaker in parliamentary robes, would occupy the Woolsack. A procession would be formed outside the Chamber, with the members of the procession standing in the following order:
# The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod or his deputy
# The Garter Principal King of Arms or another herald
# The new peer&#x27;s junior supporter
# The new peer
# The new peer&#x27;s senior supporter
When a member of the Royal Family was being introduced, there would often be more in the procession, as the Great Officers of State and the Great Officers of the Household (and sometimes others, such as an aide-de-camp carrying a coronet) would be involved. The group would start in the Robing Room, also.

The supporters were members of the House of Lords of the same rank of peerage as the new peer. (In other words, Dukes would support Dukes, Marquesses would support Marquesses, and so forth.) The new peer and his/her supporters would wear parliamentary robes and bicorn hats if men or caps if women. The procession would enter the Chamber, proceed towards the Lord Chancellor (the peer and his/her supporters stopping thrice to bow towards the Cloth of Estate before reaching the Lord Chancellor), and the Garter Principal King of Arms would present the peer&#x27;s letters patent, which are issued by the sovereign to create a new peerage, and the new peer would kneel before the Lord Chancellor (or remain standing if a member of the Royal Family) and present his writ of summons, which is issued by the sovereign to command the peer&#x27;s attendance in Parliament. The Reading Clerk of the House of Lords would then read aloud the letters patent and the writ. The peer would take the Oath of Allegiance or the Solemn Affirmation, and would sign the Test Roll, at the top of which the same Oath is written.

Thereafter, the Garter Principal King of Arms would &quot;place&quot; the new peer and his supporters by leading them to the Lords bench traditionally occupied by those of the new peer&#x27;s rank (senior members of the Royal Family were led to a chair of state on the Throne dais rather than be placed on a bench). The peer and supporters would put on their hats, rise, doff their hats (unless women), and bow to the Lord Chancellor, and then repeat the previous practice two times. After bowing to the Lord Chancellor for the third time, the peers would, along with the Garter Principal King of Arms and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, leave the Chamber, with the new peer shaking hands with the Lord Chancellor as he left. The new peer would later return, and possibly participate in a debate (a member of the Royal Family, earlier seated beside the Throne, would now sit on the Crossbenches, signifying his/her political neutrality).

In 1998, the House of Lords constituted a Committee to modernise the entire ceremony. The Committee found that &quot;Far from being dignified, the practice of kneeling to the Lord Chancellor is particularly awkward because the new peer, wearing robes, simply kneels down on the floor with nothing to lean on for support [We] see no need to retain the act of kneeling before the Lord Chancellor.&quot; The Committee also recommended that the reading of the writ of summons, which is of the same form for all peers, be ceased, though the reading of the Letters Patent, which are often unique to the peer, be continued. The Committee further suggested that the wearing of hats and the hat doffing ceremony, which &quot;serves no symbolic purpose&quot;, also stop. Finally, it deemed that, since the seating of Lords in order of the degree of peerage was an outdated practice, the Lords instead sitting by party, the practice of placing the new peer stop.

The present ceremony involves the same procession as the former one, but, instead of proceeding to the Woolsack, it stops in front of the Table of the House. The Reading Clerk reads the Letters Patent presented to him by the Garter Principal King of Arms, and administers the Oath of Allegiance or Solemn Affirmation to the new peer. The new peer and his supporters together bow to the Cloth of Estate, which is placed at the end of the House, behind the sovereign&#x27;s throne and the Woolsack. The procession then proceeds out of the Chamber, the new peer stopping at the Woolsack to shake hands with the Lord Chancellor. Upon returning to the Chamber, the new peer takes any seat he pleases, sitting with his/her party, or, if neutral, sitting amongst the Crossbenchers.

The role of presiding over the House of Lords was removed from the office of Lord Chancellor by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. As a result, the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s former role in introductions has been the Lord Speaker&#x27;s since 2006.

==Lords Spiritual ceremony==
The ceremony for Lords Spiritual has been significantly simpler, and was not affected by the recommendations of the 1998 Committee. The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod and the Garter Principal King of Arms do not take part. The supporters of the Lords Spiritual are, in all cases, other Lords Spiritual; the new member and the supporters wear their clerical robes. The procession, with the junior supporter in front and the senior supporter behind the new archbishop or bishop, arrives in front of the Table of the House. The new member then submits his writ of summons, which is read by a Clerk. (Archbishops and bishops do not, with regards to their lordships, have letters patent to present.) The Clerk then administers the Oath. Then, the procession progresses to the Woolsack, where the new archbishop or bishop shakes hands with the Lord Speaker. Then, instead of leaving the Chamber, the new member and his/her supporters immediately take seats on the Bishops&#x27; Benches. (Archbishops and bishops do not sit with any particular party, though the two Bishops&#x27; Benches are on the same side of the Chamber as the seats for members of the Government party.)

<doc id="384773" wikidata="Q4118927" url="?curid=384773" title="Yasuda / Fuji Bank">
<text>The Yasuda Bank () from 1880 to 1948, then Fuji Bank () from 1948 to 2000, was one of the largest Japanese banks for much of the 20th century, together with Dai-Ichi Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Mitsui Bank, and Sumitomo Bank. It was the main bank of the Yasuda zaibatsu until World War II, and afterwards of the Fuyo Group.

The Fuji Bank combined with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan in 2000 to form Mizuho Financial Group, and changed its name to Mizuho Corporate Bank in 2002 after transferring its retail banking operations to Mizuho Bank.

== History ==

=== Yasuda Bank ===

The bank traces its history back to the old Yasuda zaibatsu. Zenjiro Yasuda, a migrant from Toyama, opened a dry goods store in the Nihonbashi area of Edo in 1864, known as &quot;Yasuda-ya&quot; (lit. House of Yasuda). After the Meiji Restoration in 1869, the company underwrote bonds for the Japanese government, whose credit standing was low then, and financed many public works such as railroads, harbor constructions, and so forth. The company was incorporated in 1880 with a share capital of 10 million yen. In 1912 Yasuda-ya was incorporated and renamed Yasuda Bank, in a process where Yasuda absorbed the assets and business of seventeen different Japanese banking institutions.

In the Taishō period, the Japanese banking community was thrown into financial difficulties because of World War I and the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. In the immediate wake of the earthquake, Yasuda absorbed ten smaller regional banks which lacked a sufficient financial base to cover their deposits. This merger made Yasuda Bank the largest in Japan by several measures, with share capital of 150 million yen, deposits of 542 million yen, loans of 521 million yen, 211 branches and 3,700 employees.

The Yasuda Bank&#x27;s activity remained entirely domestic. By 1929, it had no offices outside of Japan and its colonies, in contrast to its commercial banking peers Mitsubishi Bank, Mitsui Bank and Sumitomo Bank, let alone the Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Chōsen and Bank of Taiwan for which foreign trade was part of a public-interest mandate under special legislation.

=== After World War II ===
Following World War II, the Yasuda zaibatsu was dissolved by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. On October 1, 1948, Yasuda Bank changed its name to Fuji Bank, named after Mount Fuji. Fuji formed the Fuyo Group, one of the largest &quot;keiretsu&quot;, together with other former Yasuda zaibatsu companies.

As the Japanese economy was rebuilt after the war, Fuji Bank expanded its business in syndicated lending, corporate banking, public money management, mortgages and retail financial services. It worked with other major banks as partners when it was at risk of over-extending its funds. However, the formation of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB) in 1971 dethroned Fuji from its top status in the Japanese banking industry. In an attempt to restore its preeminence, Fuji agreed to merge with Osaka-based Sanwa Bank in the late 1970s, but failed to win approval from the Ministry of Finance. Sumitomo Bank also rose as an intense competitor to Fuji in the 1980s, and both banks aggressively courted similar corporate banking clients, growing their loan portfolios dramatically with what would later become non-performing loans. Fuji Capital Markets Corp. was founded in New York in 1990 going on to become one of the lead players in the swaps market. FCMC went on to open an offices in London in 1992 and Hong Kong in 1994 which still exist as Mizuho Capital Markets Corp. FCMC was one of the first Japanese Banks to connect to the internet, registering the fcmc.com domain in 1993. However, following the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s, Fuji and other Japanese banks were increasingly troubled by bad loans and inadequate back-office systems. Fuji attempted to diversify its domestic services, establishing Fuji Securities and Fuji Trust &amp; Banking Co. in 1994, but neither subsidiary was able to make substantial profits.

On November 24, 1997, Yamaichi, Fuji Bank&#x27;s affiliated securities firm, announced it would cease operations and was declared bankrupt by the Tokyo District Court. Fuji&#x27;s inability to support Yamaichi led to a rapid fall in Fuji&#x27;s stock price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Between 1998 and 2000, Fuji laid off thousands of employees and borrowed one trillion yen of public funds. Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking, Fuji&#x27;s affiliated trust company, entered severe financial difficulties in 1999 and sought an additional capital injection from Fuji. Fuji was still experiencing its own difficulties and could not afford to rescue Yasuda. However, Fuji and DKB were able to negotiate a three-party transaction in which Fuji and DKB merged their respective trust banks, and the merged company acquired the corporate and pension divisions of Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking.

===Merger===

On September 29, 2000, all shares of Fuji, DKB and the Industrial Bank of Japan were acquired by a newly formed Mizuho Holdings. The three banks continued to operate separately pending their final legal merger.

At the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York&#x27;s World Trade Center, Fuji Bank&#x27;s United States offices were located at the impact zone of United Airlines Flight 175 in 2 World Trade Center (the South Tower) occupying the office space on the 79th through 82nd floors. After the North Tower was hit, the managers rushed to evacuate their employees. Within fifteen minutes, the managers had successfully evacuated 120 employees. However, 23 Fuji Bank employees died in the attack. Fuji Bank employee Stanley Praimnath was one of only eighteen remaining people located at the South Tower&#x27;s collision zone to survive. DKB&#x27;s offices were located in the North Tower.

On April 1, 2002, Fuji acquired the corporate banking operations of DKB and absorbed all operations of IBJ, renaming itself Mizuho Corporate Bank. DKB simultaneously acquired the individual banking operations of Fuji and renamed itself Mizuho Bank. Both banks became wholly owned subsidiaries of Mizuho Financial Group. The legal merger of Mizuho Corporate Bank with Mizuho Bank took place on July 1, 2013.

<doc id="384775" wikidata="Q1928434" url="?curid=384775" title="Touring bicycle">
<text>A touring bicycle is a bicycle designed or modified to handle bicycle touring. To make the bikes sufficiently robust, comfortable and capable of carrying heavy loads, special features may include a long wheelbase (for ride comfort and to avoid pedal-to-luggage conflicts), frame materials that favor flexibility over rigidity (for ride comfort—though frame flexing can eventually lead to metal fatigue and frame failure, so newer frames are rigid), heavy duty wheels (for load capacity), and multiple mounting points (for luggage racks, fenders, and bottle cages).

==Types==

Touring bicycle configurations are highly variable and may include road, sport touring, trail, recumbent, or tandem configurations.

===Road touring===
Road touring bicycles have a frame geometry designed to provide a comfortable ride and stable, predictable handling when laden with baggage, provisions for the attachment of fenders and mounting points for carrier racks and panniers.

Modern road tourers may employ 700C (622 mm) wheels — the same diameter as a road (racing) bicycle. Other road touring bikes may feature wider rims and more clearance in the frame for wider bicycle tires. Before the 1980s, many touring bikes were built with 630 mm (27-inch) wheels which have a slightly larger diameter.

Other touring bikes use 660 mm (26-inch) wheels for both off-road and on-road use. Advantages of the slightly smaller wheel include additional strength, worldwide tire availability, and lighter weight. Some touring bicycles, such as the Rivendell Atlantis and Surly Long Haul Trucker, offer frames designed for 660 mm (26-inch, ISO 559) wheels or for 700C (622 mm) wheels, with the frame geometry optimal for the selected wheel size.

Specially made touring tires for 660 mm (26-inch) wheels are now widely available, especially in developing countries, where 700C (622 mm) may be difficult to obtain. Hence, on the mass ride from Paris to the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the Fédération Française de Cyclotourisme asked all riders to use 660 mm (26-inch) wheels. Factors that affect rolling resistance include tire air pressure, tread and tire width as well as wheel size.

===Sport touring===
The sport/touring bicycle is a very lightweight touring bike fitted with lighter wheels and narrower 25–28 mm tires. It may also be described as a road racing bike fitted with heavier tires and slightly more relaxed frame geometry (though still quicker than the average road touring bike). It is designed as a fast-handling, responsive and quick day touring machine. As such, it is intended to carry only the rider and very light loads, such as encountered in &quot;credit card touring&quot;, where riders typically carry little more than a pocketbook and credit cards to book overnight lodging at any handy hotel, hostel, or bed-and-breakfast while on a journey.

Gearing is often a mix of closely spaced ratios for speed, combined with a few low gears for long climbs. Sport/touring bikes may sometimes have provisions for mounting slim fenders and a rear carrier or pannier rack, though in the interests of weight savings and quicker handling, most do not.

===Expedition touring===

There are numerous variants on the traditional road tourer depending on the weight carried and the type of terrain expected. Expedition tourers are strongly built bicycles designed for carrying heavy loads over the roughest roads in remote and far-flung places. These range from simply stronger built mountain bikes, equipped with racks, panniers, mudguards and heavy-duty tires, to purpose-built bicycles built to cope with long-haul touring on tracks and unsealed roads in developing countries. Their frames are often made of steel as it is stronger, more flexible- therefore more comfortable over rough surfaces- and any breakages can be repaired virtually anywhere in the world.

A typical expedition touring bike would be made of relatively heavy duty steel tubing, with wheels, and componentry chosen for robustness and ease of maintenance. The main design criteria for such a bike would be to allow all-day comfort on the bike, have good handling characteristics under heavy load, and be capable of running smoothly on good roads, but also on the roughest of tracks. Some bike tourers have made their own expedition bikes, by building up on mountain bike frames. The key difference between a mountain bike and an expedition touring bike would be the addition of racks for panniers, and tougher, all purpose tires. They will have a longer wheelbase to allow for more comfortable cruising, at the expense of the manoeuvrability of a mountain bike. Most tourers also prefer heavier, stronger wheels than would be normal on a production mountain bike and although some are now equipped with disc brakes to eliminate natural rim side-wall wear. Most expedition bikes will have the same range of gears as a mountain bike and for durability some use the Rohloff Speedhub at the expense of its high cost.

It is a small, specialist market, so only a small number of bikes are sold under this description, few if any by the biggest manufacturers. Examples are the EXP and Raven from Thorn Cycles, and the Roberts Roughstuff, all made in the UK. Koga-Miyata produce the Signature range of bikes that allows users to specify many aspects of the bikes components to ultimately achieve an expedition bike.

===Mixed terrain touring===
Mixed terrain cycle touring bikes are a cross between mountain and road bikes. Also called all-rounders, 29er touring or monster cross, these bikes strive for a balance of efficiency and speed on and off-road. Typically they are built with light steel frames and drop handlebars. Unlike expedition touring bikes they typically sport 700C (622 mm) or 650B (584 mm) sized wheels. Yet like other touring bikes, they stress a relaxed geometry for all day comfort. Low mountain bike gearing is often used and these bikes can usually carry a medium weight load without trouble. Mixed terrain touring bikes fall into this category and are used for mixed terrain touring in the mountains. A few manufacturers like Rawland Cycles, Surly Bikes, and Singular Cycles are now producing these bikes. Salsa has also come up with a related model called the Fargo. But many riders convert older, non-suspension mountain bikes and cyclo-cross bikes for the purpose.

=== Folding/collapsible touring ===
There is an increasing number of specially designed and built or adapted folding bicycles used in bicycle touring. Most are built with wheel 406 mm rims, although some are built with 400 mm (16-inch) wheels, and the AM series Moulton is built around a specially made wheel. Moulton&#x27;s current TSR range use standard wheels with the 406 mm rim format. Many have ride characteristics just as good as touring bicycles with 660 mm (26-inch) or 700C (622 mm) wheels, but they have the advantage that they can be folded or collapsed for much easier transportation in trains and in airline luggage. The Bike Friday New World Tourist packs into an airline checkable suitcase that can be converted into a trailer and pulled behind the bicycle. The Raleigh Twenty, manufactured from 1968 to 1984, though still commonly available today second hand, is also a popular frame format used to construct collapsible touring bicycles. Other bicycles such as the Surly Travelers Check and the Santana Travel Tandem are full-sized bicycles which do not fold, but instead use Bicycle Torque Couplings to enable separating the frame into two parts for easier transport.

===Recumbent touring===
Recumbents differ from more traditional bicycles in that the rider sits in a reclining or semi-reclining position with their legs in front. Benefits claimed include greater comfort and aerodynamic efficiency. The luggage carrying arrangements of recumbents are also different, often requiring special panniers and racks designed to fit under and behind the seat to provide similar capacity to a conventional touring bike. A disadvantage is that the rider becomes less visible in traffic.

===Tandem touring===
Tandems are bicycles built for two or more riders. They can make it easier for two or more riders of different abilities to ride together and are also used to allow people with disabilities to enjoy cycling. A typical traditional upright tandem does not allow for any more luggage than a solo bicycle, but this limitation can be overcome by pulling a trailer.

==Specifications==
Touring bicycles are usually equipped with luggage racks front and rear, designed to hold panniers or other forms of luggage. To accommodate long rides, touring bikes have comfortable handlebars and saddles. In fact there are many different bicycle handlebar arrangements available to touring cyclists, the choice of which is highly individual.

===Frame===
Touring bicycles may appear similar to road bicycles if they have drop handlebars. However, they greatly differ by typically having a longer wheelbase and more stable steering geometry, with numerous attachments for luggage racks, fenders (mudguards), lights, high capacity water bottles, tools and spare parts. Chainstays must be long enough to accommodate panniers without them brushing the rider&#x27;s heels, and the entire structure must be stiff enough to safely handle long, fast descents with the machine fully loaded.

To be field-repairable (i.e. welding) and for reliability, touring bicycles typically have a steel (CroMo) frame and fork, however aluminum and titanium are also sometimes used.

===Wheels===
Higher quality touring bikes are outfitted with strong wheels that are less likely to break under heavy loads on rough terrain. This means double-wall rims, with usually 36, and sometimes as many as 48, spokes, laced 3 or 4-cross.

Although both sizes are common, wheels are often 660 mm (26-inch, ISO 559) in preference over 700C (622 mm, ISO 622). This is because ISO 559 wheels are used on mountain bicycles and are more durable and often easier to source in remote locations than 700C (622 mm) wheels. World bicycle tourers Tim and Cindie Travis are notable advocates of ISO 559 mountain wheels for touring bicycles. Older touring bicycles may have 630 mm (27-inch) wheels still.

===Gearing===
Touring bicycles traditionally use wide-ratio derailleur gears, often with a very low gear, in some countries called a &quot;granny gear&quot;, for steep hills under load. Typically the gearing has a triple chainring similar to mountain bicycles, whereas most road bicycles have only two chainrings. Raleigh&#x27;s 1985 catalogue lists touring bicycles that usually fitted with a 14-32 tooth 6-speed freewheel and 28/45/50-tooth chainrings, typically giving a gear range of 1.84–7.68 metres of development (23 to 96 gear inches). A modern popular combination is to use an 11-34 tooth cassette with 22/32/44-tooth chainrings, typically giving a gear range from 1.44–8.32 metres of development (18 to 104 gear inches).

Internal-geared hubs with 5, 7, 8, 11 or even 14 gear ratios have become an option in recent years because of their robustness and low maintenance. In particular, the Rohloff 14-speed hub with a gear range of over 500% has been used on at least two around-the world bicycle tours. Internal-geared hubs have a couple of advantages over traditional derailleur gears, in that they can use stronger chains as generally a single sprocket and chainring combination will be used. Secondly the spread of gears can be made more evenly, that is to say there are many duplicated and unusable gears in a derailleur geared setup.

===Brakes===

Touring bicycles usually have linear-pull brakes or cantilever brakes, instead of the caliper brakes used on racing bicycles. Caliper brakes are less suitable because, to fit around mudguards (fenders) and wide tires, they become large and may flex when trying to stop a heavy bike. Some newer touring bikes use disc brakes, because of their greater stopping power in wet and muddy conditions and also to avoid outer rim wear. However, they are more complicated, so repairing them in remote locations can be difficult; they also weigh more than cantilever brakes, increase the stresses on spokes, and require the front wheel to be dished, which reduces the durability of the wheels.

Thus, touring bikes trade speed for utility and ruggedness. This combination is popular with commuters and couriers as well.

===Trailers===
Instead of panniers, some riders prefer a bicycle trailer. Trailers are easy to use and allow touring with bikes on which it is impossible to attach racks. However, double wheeled trailers decrease maneuverability and are not particularly suited for touring in mountainous regions or on rugged terrain. On the other hand, single wheel trailers are extremely maneuverable, with the trailer wheel tracking very closely with the rear wheel. These can easily be ridden on single track trails (about 40 cm width), over some very technical terrain.

Trailers have an advantage over panniers on single track trails because the bike itself carries no extra weight, except some on the rear axle attachment (the trailer itself can be loaded with up to 70 kg). This allows the rider to shift weight as if without load and clear logs or rocks (trailers will typically follow over anything the bottom bracket clears).

<doc id="384777" wikidata="Q3328714" url="?curid=384777" title="Music of North Macedonia">
<text>The Macedonian music refers to all forms of music associated with ethnic Macedonians. It shares similarities with the music of neighbouring Balkan countries, yet it remains overall distinctive in its rhythm and sound.

==Folk music==
The ethnic Macedonian folk music (Macedonian: Народна музика, &quot;Narodna muzika&quot;) includes:
*Traditional music (Macedonian: Изворна музика, translit.: Izvorna muzika literally meaning: &quot;roots music&quot;)
*Contemporary folk music (Macedonian language: современа народна музика)

===Traditional music===
The Macedonian traditional music, which can be rural or urban (starogradska muzika), includes: lyric songs, epic songs, labour songs, ritual songs, humorous songs, circle dance (&quot;oro&quot;), the old urban style called Čalgija (not to be confused with chalga) etc.
Popular traditional songs are: &quot;Kaleš bre Anǵo&quot;, &quot;Slušam kaj šumat šumite&quot;, &quot;Biljana platno beleše&quot;, &quot;Dafino vino crveno&quot;, &quot;Narode Makedonski&quot;, &quot;Zemjo Makedonska&quot; and many others.
Often referenced oro dances are &quot;Teškoto&quot; from the village of Galičnik, &quot;Kalajdžiskoto&quot;, &quot;Komitskoto&quot; (&quot;The Dance of the freedom fighters&quot;) and others. An internationally acclaimed professional folklore association is the award-winning Tanec.


The music of the Balkans is known for complex rhythms. Macedonian music exemplifies this trait. Folk songs like &quot;Pomnish li, libe Todoro&quot; (Помниш ли, либе Тодоро) can have rhythms as complex as 22/16, divided by stanza to 2+2+3+2+2+3+2+2+2+2, a combination of the two common meters 11=2+2+3+2+2 and 11=3+2+2+2+2 (sheet music). In order to add tension to notes, musicians (primarily from older schools) will add the distinctive characteristic of stretching out beats.
The gajda (гајда), a type of bagpipe, was the most common folk instrument in traditional Macedonian culture. It has now become an instrument for concert recitation, drawing on recent legends like Pece Atanasovski (video), leader of the Radio Skopje ensemble Ansambl na Narodni Instrumenti, as the source of modern tradition. 
Other instruments include:
*šupelka (шупелка) – small flute
*kemane (кемане) – three-stringed fiddle
*tambura (тамбура) – long-necked lute
*zurla (зурла) – large double-reed horn
*tapan (тапан) – cylindrical drum
*kaval (кавал) – rim-blown flute
*harmonika (хармоника) – accordion

Macedonian folk orchestras consist of a clarinet or saxophone, drum kit, bass guitar, accordion and guitar, sometimes with modern synthesizers and drum machines. These orchestras are very popular in Macedonia. Popular members are virtuoso musicians Skender Ameti and Goran Alachki on accordion and Miroslav Businovski on clarinet.

Čalgija is an urban style, played by bands (&quot;Čalgii&quot;) with a dajre (tambourine) and tarabuka (hourglass drum) providing percussion for ut (lute), kanun (zither), clarinet and violin. Though modern musicians have updated the Čalgija into a spectrum of hard and soft, classical and pop sounds, some traditional musicians remain. Perhaps the most influential of recent years was Tale Ognenovski, who plays a wide variety of traditional and modern sounds.

After World War II People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia sponsored the creation of professional ensembles such a &quot;Chalgii orchestra&quot;, &quot;Folk music orchestra&quot; and &quot;Authentic folk instruments orchestra&quot; which were departments of &quot;Radio Television Skopje&quot; and performed arranged version of folk melodies. Folk music orchestras performed arranged versions of folk melodies.

Since 1971 the Macedonian folk music duo, Selimova-Želčeski is active. At the International Folklore Conference organized by the International Folklore Committee in Istanbul, Turkey, 1977, on the subject of &quot;Folklore on the Radio&quot; representative from Yugoslavian Radio Television (Former Yugoslavia) was Dushko Dimitrovski, Editor of the Folk Music Department for &quot;Radio Television Skopje&quot; (now Macedonian Radio Television) from the Socialist Republic of Macedonia presented folklore material in his presentation entitled &quot;Chalgija music in Macedonia&quot;, including the recordings of Macedonian folk dances: &quot;Kasapsko oro&quot;, arranged by Tale Ognenovski, and &quot;Kumovo oro chochek&quot;, composed by Tale Ognenovski and performed by him as clarinet soloist accompanied by the &quot;Chalgii&quot; orchestra of Radio Television Skopje (now Macedonian Radio Television), which created great interest not only amongst the delegates of the Conference but also around the world.

In the book entitled &quot;Rough Guide to World Music Volume One: Africa, Europe &amp; The Middle East&quot; written by Simon Broughton and Mark Ellingham on page 202 subtitle: Macedonia tricky rhythm, Kim Burton noted: &quot;In western music, a bar of triple time – such as a waltz has three equal beats: but in Macedonia it may a bar of 7/8 divided up as 3-2-2 or 2-2-3 or 2-3-2 and so on…&quot; In this book on page 203 was written: &quot;One of the few clarinettists to have performed successfully both with a calgia and in the more modern style is Tale Ognenovski, born in 1922 and one of the most influential musicians of the post-war era. He was a member of the Tanec group during the 1950s and lead clarinet of the Radio Skopje calgia. The composer of many tunes that have become standards, and which is the basis for Macedonia&#x27;s own new composed folk music.&quot; 

The magazine &quot;Ilustrovana politika&quot; observes,&quot;Radio Television Belgrade&quot; (PGP-RTB, now PGP-RTS Radio Television of Serbia, Serbia) released an LP of Macedonian folk music (LP 1439 RTB, produced in 1979), on which is performances by the extraordinary clarinetist Tale Ognenovski. His music repertoire is folk dances, jazz (besides others he includes works by Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw), concerts from Carl Maria von Weber, Mozart and Ernesto Cavallini...This is Tale Ognenovski who began to play the clarinet in the village of Brusnik near Bitola, who with this wooden instrument toured the world and received well-deserved applause wherever he performed.&quot;

In his book, &quot;For Our Music&quot; Dushko Dimitrovski writes: &quot;The impossible becomes possible: two usually non-complementary parallel-existing worlds of sounds, Europe and The Orient, are in Tale Ognenovski&#x27;s music naturally brought closer together, understand each other and merge.&quot;

In September, 2001 Tale Ognenovski released CD album: &quot;Jazz, Macedonian Folk Dances and Classical Music&quot; Reviewer Neil Horner of the MusicWeb International comments, &quot;He is undoubtedly an exceptional artist and the predominant image created in my mind is of Benny Goodman playing the superb Contrasts he commissioned Bartók to write for him …This disc is likely to appeal to world music aficionados who enjoy the Balkan/Levantine soundworld and perhaps also those who care to hear the source musics of their classical favourites, the aforementioned Bartók but also, here, perhaps people like Skalkottas.&quot;

===Contemporary folk music===
Contemporary folk music is a popular style based on the traditional folk music. However, unlike it, contemporary folk music is credited to a particular author and it falls under the copyright laws, it is performed by professional musicians and it is usually (but not necessarily) played with modern instrumentation. Usually, the older performers and composers (such as the highly acclaimed Aleksandar Sarievski, Jonče Hristovski and Dobri Stavrevski) stay closer to the traditional roots, and thus contemporary folk music is often mistaken for traditional. On the other hand, the younger usually espouse a more modernized sound and image, thus often being disproved by the traditional purists as kitsch. Nevertheless, the style is popular among the common people and notable performers include: Anka Gieva, Vanja Lazarova, Violeta Tomovska, Elena Georgieva, Suzana Spasovska, Mitre Mitrevski, Efto Pupinovski, , Orce Stefkovski, Blagica Pavlovska, Dragan Vučić, Zoran Vanev, Vaska Ilieva Wik Kakarotski and others. Some of them also perform traditional songs. The newest generation of performers of this genre such as Aneta Micevska, Blagojce Stojanovski-TUSE, Sonja Tarculovska, Elena Velevska, Jasmina Mukaetova, Aneta Nakovska, Pane Panev altogether with the bands such as Molika, Bioritam, Akademci Bolero bend, Art Plaza have introduced a newer outlook to this kind of music inspired by the Serbian turbofolk, Bulgarian chalga, and Greek laika, so their style is more considered as pop-folk, rather than folk music.

Several popular folk music festivals exist, including: &quot;Folk fest Valandovo&quot; in Valandovo, &quot;Serenada na Širok sokak&quot; in Bitola, &quot;Cvetnici&quot; in Skopje, Ohridski trubaduri – Ohrid Fest in Ohrid and others.

===Outside North Macedonia===
Traditional as well as modern music is created and performed in other countries where Macedonian communities exist, which include primarily the Balkan countries surrounding North Macedonia, as well as enclaves resulting from the diaspora in the US, Australia, Canada and other countries.
A notable example is the folk musician Kostas Novakis from Greece (born in Koufalia, Thessaloniki regional unit, Greek Macedonia), who claims Macedonian ethnicity and performs traditional ethnic Macedonian music. Despite the political tensions between North Macedonia, with ethnic Macedonians on one side and Greece on the other, Novakis released several CD titles with traditional ethnic Macedonian music in Greece .

===Receiving the audience through the World of Unusual Rhythm of Macedonian Folk Music===

&quot;Macedonian folk music is governed by rhythmic laws and set metres. Foreign influences, in so far as they existed, where subjected to the rules of accentuation of the Macedonian popular language. The melody is usually asymmetrical... &quot;&quot;Teškoto&quot; from Nižopole (Bitola) means &quot;heavy,&quot; and indicates the heavy rhythm which is typical of very ancient dances,&quot; appeared in an article entitled, &quot;Extracts from PROGRAMME NOTES ON THE DANCES AND SONGS performed at the Yugoslav Folk Music Festival&quot;, with the subtitle &#x27;MACEDONIA – represented by 23 villages&quot;, published by The International Folk Music Council (IFMC) Stevan Ognenovski in his book entitled &quot;Tale Ognenovski Virtuoso of the Clarinet and Composer&quot; / &quot;Тале Огненовски виртуоз на кларинет и композитор&quot; (2000), noted: &quot;At the &quot;Yugoslav Folk Music Festival in Opatija, Croatia (8 to 14 September 1951) the Folk Dance group from the Bitola village of Nižopole from the Bitola in which Tale Ognenovski was playing as a clarinet soloist in the folk dance &quot;Teškoto&quot;, received First Award as the best Folk Dance group at the festival. This was a great success because in this Festival participated 85 different folk dance groups from Macedonia, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The musical part of the group had only two members: Tale Ognenovski played solo clarinet with the accompaniment of drummer Lambe Petrovski.&quot;

Croatian ethnomusicologist Dr Vinko Zganec wrote &quot;The clarinet was as effective an accompaniment to the large drum in the folk dance from Kozjak as it was to the small drum in the folk dance &quot;Teškoto&quot; from Nižopole (Bitola). They provided a very effective combination.&quot; This appeared in an article entitled &quot;Yugoslav Musical folklore at the Festival in Opatija&quot;. Yugoslav Folk Music Festival had been especially arranged by &quot;Unions of Societies for Culture and Education of Yugoslavia&quot; for the members of the Conference of The International Folk Music Council (IFMC) to studying folk music tradition and beauty and variety of Yugoslav folk art of 85 folk dance groups from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Slovenia, Macedonia and Croatia which participated at this festival. &quot;Every evening, for three hours or more, we witnessed an astonishing pageant of costume and custom, ritual and social dance, song and instrumental playing by 700 performers brought together from every part of the country. This was a world whose riches most of us had barely guessed at and, in this highly concentrated presentation, it was an overwhelming and unforgettable experience,&quot; written by Marie Slocombe and appeared in an article entitled, &quot;Some Impression of the Yugoslav Conference and Festival&quot; published by The International Folk Music Council (IFMC).

The Tanec Ensemble of folklore dances and songs of Macedonia was founded by the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia in 1949 with an aim to collect, preserve and present the Macedonian folklore. Ensemble Tanec performed arranged version of folk melodies.&quot; On 20 January 1956, the Tanec ensemble arrived in the US, and their televised performance on CBS TV Programme Omnibus (U.S. TV series) on 22 January 1956 was viewed by millions people. It established the Tanec ensemble international stature and confirmation of this were reviews in the newspapers in North America for his 66 concerts:

On 27 January 1956, the Tanec Ensemble performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City. For this Carnegie Hall concert The New York Times music critic John Martin, wrote, &quot;This particular group, part of a national movement toward the revival of the folk arts, comes from Macedonia … brilliantly spectacular and wonderfully unfamiliar dances … unforgettable pipe.&quot;

The New York Herald Tribune music critic Walter Terry, wrote, &quot;Tanec, a Macedonian group of some forty dancers and musicians, gave generously of their rich folk heritage ... In &quot;Sopska Poskocica&quot;, to make the point five young men took over the stage and indulged in show-off tactics to attract the girl ... An audience which jammed Carnegie to capacity cheered and applauded the folk dancing with as much enthusiasm as if it had been witnessing classical, theatrical ballet at its most glittering&quot;.

Stjepan Pucak, former &quot;Tanjug&quot; correspondent and Croatian journalist note: &quot;To choose which were the most successful of the program&#x27;s seventeen folk dances, when all were greeted with stormy applause, is really very difficult and risky ... &quot;Sopska Poskocica&quot; was even repeated, and to repeat a performance on the American stage is a really rare and exclusive event.&quot;

Naum Nachevski, journalist of the newspaper Nova Makedonija, Skopje, People’s Republic of Macedonia note: &quot;The audience interrupted some of the folk dance performances with applause; these dances in particular left great impressions of the folklore … the unusual rhythm of Macedonian folk music. The &quot;Tanec&quot; ensemble not only received a warm welcome from the New York public, but also from the New York press.&quot;

The New York Times music critic John Martin, on 5 February 1956, wrote, &quot;There is an amazing variety to the dances that comprised this particular program … the broken circles of the kolo of the Macedonian mountains … a dateless reed pipe&quot;.

Tanec&#x27;s North American tour began with their debut on CBS TV Programme Omnibus (U.S. TV series) on 22 January 1956. Their first live US television performance was taped on videocassette and archived at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., and in Catalog Record is written description content: &quot;The Yugoslav national folk ballet / directed by Elliot Silverstein; with the Tanec dance troupe from Macedonia (20 min.)&quot;

For the concerts at The Civic Opera House in Chicago, Illinois on 4–5 February 1956, The &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; reviewer, Claudia Cassidy, noted: &quot;… called Tanec, which is the Macedonian word for dance, this group of 37 dancers, singers and musicians is a kaleidoscope of the Balkans ... When five of them dance the &quot;Sopska Poskocica&quot;, which apparently just means they are showing off to the girls. I would keep them any day as an unfair trade for the four little swans in Swan Lake.&quot;

For the concert at The Academy of Music in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 7 February 1956, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; music critic Samuel Singer commented, &quot;&#x27;Tanec&#x27; means &#x27;dance&#x27;, but &#x27;dance&#x27; in a larger form than customary. Besides dance alone, it conveys drama, ritual, tradition, songs, even military maneuvers ... there was a remarkable precision in both dancing and playing ... Clarinet, bass fiddle, violin, drums, guitar and flute provided most of the accompaniments in various combinations.&quot;

For the concert at The Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., on 9 February 1956, Paul Hume, the Washington Post and Times music critic observed, &quot;A &quot;Sopska Poskocica&quot; is devised to show the girls how handsome and wonderful and brilliant and exciting and sensational their man friends are. The rate at which it is danced, and the tremendous energy and precision of six men who dance it, is unique and demanded a repetition.&quot;

For the concert at Massey Hall in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on 13 February 1956, John Kraglund, a music critic for The Globe and Mail wrote: &quot;The first impression, however, must be one of rhythmic precision ... Nor was the performance without spectacle ... in the case of one dance, Sopska Poskocica, it was no more than a show-off dance. As such it was highly effective.&quot;

For the concert at The War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, California on 7 March 1956, San Francisco Chronicle music critic R. H. Hagan says, &quot;… in a number titled simply &quot;Macedonian Tune&quot;, which in its intricate rhythms and plaintive melody should at least make Dave Brubeck send out an emergency call for Darius Milhaud&quot;.

For the concert at The Philharmonic Auditorium in Los Angeles, California on 12 March 1956, Los Angeles Times music critic Albert Goldberg commented: &quot;For authentic folk dancing, wild and free and yet subject to its own intricate disciplines, this group would be hard to beat ...They are accompanied by a group of musicians consisting of a violinist, guitar and accordion players, a flutist, a clarinetist and double bass, though drums of different types are frequently involved, as well as a shepherd&#x27;s reed pipe&quot;.

&quot;Dance Observer&quot; commented: &quot;The capacity audience at Carnegie Hall on January 27 for the single New York performance of Tanec, the Yugoslav National Folk Ballet, enjoyed a fascinating cross-section of over 2000 years of human history and culture. Tanec is a Macedonian group&quot;.

After the end of the tour the Life commented: &quot;A hundred years ago on the rugged roads of Macedonia, bands of brigands used to plunder the caravans of rich merchants and, like Robin Hood, pass on some of their spoils to the poor ... this spring, the Yugoslav National Folk Ballet is making a first, and highly successful tour of the U.S ... Together they make as vigorous a display of dancing as the U.S. has ever seen.&quot;

===Mokranjac School of Music===
The Mokranjac School of Music was established in Skopje in 1934. In addition to its well-respected choir, it was famous for the people that were involved in its establishment, composers like Trajko Prokopiev and Todor Skalovski.

===Post-WWII===

After the formation of the PR Macedonia, the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra was established in 1944, while in 1947 the Association of Musicians of Macedonia was created. Shortly after that, the first Macedonian radio concert was made, conducted by Todor Skalovski.

During the 1950s, the first Macedonian ballet by Gligor Smokvarski and opera &quot;Goce&quot; by Kiril Makedonski were produced. The period after these brought a relative renaissance of Macedonian music, focussed on innovation. The most prominent composers in this period are Zivko Firfov, Trajko Prokopiev, Stefan Gajdov, Todor Skalovski, Petre Bogdanov Kocko, Vlastimir Nikolovski, Blagoja Ivanovski, Tomislav Zografski, Toma Prosev and Mihajlo Nikolovski. Among the most prominent music artists in this period are the opera singers Danka Firfova, Pavlina Apostolova, Georgi Bozikov and Zina Krelja, and the pianist Ladislav Palfi. Firfova was one of the first trained sopranos in Macedonia and debuted in 1947 as Santuzza in a Macedonian-language version of the &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot;, the first opera ever sung in Macedonian.

The &quot;Macedonian National Police Wind Orchestra&quot; comprising about 30 musicians and conducted by Micho Kostovski was established in 1949. In December 1952, Tale Ognenovski as clarinet soloist, together with pianist Nino Cipušev as accompaniment, performed the classical concert &quot;Concert Polka for Clarinet&quot; by Miler Bela in the &quot;Police House&quot; in Skopje with outstanding success and he became the first clarinet soloist in the history of country to perform a classical concert for the clarinet.

Perhaps these two albums are unique recordings of this concert with two clarinets where first clarinet with first arrangement and second clarinet with second arrangement that&#x27;s played simultaneously – by one performer (Tale Ognenovski). Top40-Charts News published the articles entitled, &quot;Tale Ognenovski, Internationally Renowned Jazz And Classical Clarinetist Released CD Album Entitled: Mozart And Ognenovski Clarinet Concertos To Celebrate The 250th Anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s Birthday&quot; on 13 November 2006, and &quot;Mozart and Ognenovski Is the Best Clarinet Concertos in the World&quot; on 21 November 2014 Mi2n Music Industry News Network published an article entitled, &quot;New Digital Album of Clarinetist And Composer Tale Ognenovski: &quot;Mozart Clarinet Concerto in A, K. 622 Arranged For Two Clarinets By Tale Ognenovski&quot; on 27 April 2017.

Eponymous halls at both Berkeley and Hopkins pay tribute to his service. He was also co-founder of the Russell Trust Association, which administers the business affairs of Yale&#x27;s Skull and Bones society. Gilman served for twenty five years as president of Johns Hopkins; his inauguration in 1876 has been said to mark &quot;the starting point of postgraduate education in the U.S.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
He was born in Norwich, Connecticut, the son of Eliza (Coit) and mill owner William Charles Gilman, a descendant of Edward Gilman, one of the first settlers of Exeter, New Hampshire; of Thomas Dudley, governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and one of the founders of Harvard College; and of Thomas Adgate, one of the founders of Norwich in 1659. Daniel Coit Gilman graduated from Yale College in 1852 with a degree in geography.

At Yale, he was a classmate of Andrew Dickson White, who would later serve as first president of Cornell University. The two were members of the Skull and Bones secret society, and traveled to Europe together after graduation and remained lifelong friends. Gilman was also a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. Gilman would later co-found the Russell Trust Association, the foundation behind Skull and Bones. After serving as attaché of the United States legation at St. Petersburg, Russia from 1853 to 1855, he returned to Yale and was active in planning and raising funds for the founding of Sheffield Scientific School. Gilman contemplated going into the ministry, and even obtained a license to preach, but later settled on a career in education.
===Career===

From 1856 to 1865, Gilman served as librarian of Yale College, and was also concerned with improving the New Haven public school system. When the Civil War broke out, Gilman became the recruiting sergeant for the Norton Cadets, a group of Yale graduates and faculty who drilled on the New Haven Green under the oversight of Yale professor William Augustus Norton.

In 1863, he was appointed professor of geography at the Sheffield Scientific School, and became secretary and librarian as well in 1866. Having been passed over for the presidency of Yale, for which post Gilman was said to have been the favorite of the younger faculty, he resigned these posts in 1872 to become the third president of the newly organized University of California, Berkeley. His work there was hampered by the state legislature, and in 1875 Gilman accepted the offer to establish and become first president of Johns Hopkins University.

Before being formally installed as president in 1876, he spent a year studying university organization and selecting an outstanding staff of teachers and scholars. His formal inauguration, on 22 February 1876, has become Hopkins&#x27; Commemoration Day, the day on which many university presidents have chosen to be installed in office. Among the legendary educators he assembled to teach at Johns Hopkins were classicist Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve, mathematician James Joseph Sylvester, historian Herbert Baxter Adams and chemist Ira Remsen.

In 1876, Gilman was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Gilman&#x27;s primary interest was in fostering advanced instruction and research, and as president he developed the first American graduate university in the German tradition. The aim of the modern research university, said Gilman, was to &quot;extend, even by minute accretions, the realm of knowledge&quot; At his inaugural address at Hopkins, Gilman asked: &quot;What are we aiming at?&quot; The answer, he said, was &quot;the encouragement of research and the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell.&quot;

In 1884, Gilman was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

Gilman was also active in founding Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1889 and Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1893. He founded and was for many years president of the Charity Organization of Baltimore, and in 1897 he served on the commission to draft a new charter for Baltimore. From 1896 to 1897, he was a member of the commission to settle the boundary line between Venezuela and British Guiana.

Gilman served as a trustee of the John F. Slater and Peabody education funds and as a member of John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s General Education Board. In this capacity, he became active in the promotion of education in the southern United States. He was president of the National Civil Service Reform League (1901–1907) and the American Oriental Society (1893–1906), vice president of the Archaeological Institute of America, and executive officer of the Maryland Geological Survey. He retired from Johns Hopkins in 1901, but accepted the presidency (1902–1904) of the newly founded Carnegie Institution of Washington.

His books include biographies of James Monroe (1883) and James Dwight Dana, a collection of addresses entitled &quot;University Problems&quot; (1898), and &quot;The Launching of a University&quot; (1906).

===Personal life===
Gilman married twice. His first wife was Mary Van Winker Ketcham, daughter of Tredwell Ketcham of New York City. They married on December 4, 1861, and had two daughters: Alice, who married Everett Wheeler; and Elisabeth Gilman, who became a social activist and was a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, and for governor and senator of Maryland, on the Socialist Party of America ticket. Mary Ketcham Gilman died in 1869, and Daniel Coit Gilman married his second wife, Elizabeth Dwight Woolsey, daughter of John M. Woolsey of Cleveland, and niece of Yale president Theodore Dwight Woolsey, in 1877. Daniel Gilman&#x27;s brother Edward Whiting Gilman was married to Julia Silliman, daughter of Yale University professor and chemist Benjamin Silliman. Daniel Coit Gilman died in Norwich, Connecticut.

==Legacy==
The original academic building on the Homewood campus of the Johns Hopkins University, Gilman Hall, is named in his honor. In 1897, he helped found a preparatory school called &#x27;The Country School for Boys&#x27; on the Johns Hopkins campus. Upon relocation in 1910, it was renamed in his honor and today, the Gilman School continues to be regarded among the nation&#x27;s elite private boys&#x27; schools.

On the University of California, Berkeley campus, Gilman Hall, also named in his honor, is the oldest building of the College of Chemistry and a National Historic Chemical Landmark. Named for Gilman as well is Gilman Street in Berkeley. Gilman Drive, which passes through the University of California, San Diego campus in La Jolla, CA is also named for Gilman. The Daniel Coit Gilman Summer House, in Maine, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1965. Gilman High School in Northeast Harbor, Maine, was named for Daniel Coit Gilman, who was active in local educational affairs, but it was later rebuilt and christened Mount Desert High School.

He was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership in 1895.

<text>In the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, members of the House elected at a by-election must be formally &quot;introduced&quot; to the House. (Members elected at a general election are not introduced.) The ceremony in the Commons is considerably simpler than those in the House of Lords.

By-elections are generally held on Thursdays, and the introduction in the afternoon of the Tuesday after the election. The new Member enters the Chamber along with two other members acting as &quot;supporters&quot; and bows to the Speaker. The Member and supporters then process to the Speaker&#x27;s table, where the new Member takes the Oath of Allegiance or Solemn Affirmation. Then, the Member signs the Test Roll, at the top of which the Oath is written. Finally, the Member returns to sit along with the rest of his or her party.

<text>Open Sound Control (OSC) is a protocol for networking sound synthesizers, computers, and other multimedia devices for purposes such as musical performance or show control. OSC&#x27;s advantages include interoperability, accuracy, flexibility and enhanced organization and documentation. Its disadvantages include inefficient coding of information, increased load on embedded processors, and lack of standardized messages/interoperability. The first specification was released in March 2002.

== Motivation ==
OSC is a content format developed at CNMAT by Adrian Freed and Matt Wright comparable to XML, WDDX, or JSON. It was originally intended for sharing music performance data (gestures, parameters and note sequences) between musical instruments (especially electronic musical instruments such as synthesizers), computers, and other multimedia devices. OSC is sometimes used as an alternative to the 1983 MIDI standard, when higher resolution and a richer parameter space is desired. OSC messages are transported across the internet and within local subnets using UDP/IP and Ethernet. OSC messages between gestural controllers are usually transmitted over serial endpoints of USB wrapped in the SLIP protocol.

== Features ==
OSC&#x27;s main features, compared to MIDI, include:
* Open-ended, dynamic, URI-style symbolic naming scheme
* Symbolic and high-resolution numeric data
* Pattern matching language to specify multiple recipients of a single message
* High resolution time tags
* &quot;Bundles&quot; of messages whose effects must occur simultaneously

== Applications ==
There are dozens of OSC applications, including real-time sound and media processing environments, web interactivity tools, software synthesizers, programming languages and hardware devices. OSC has achieved wide use in fields including musical expression, robotics, video performance interfaces, distributed music systems and inter-process communication.

The TUIO community standard for tangible interfaces such as multitouch is built on top of OSC. Similarly the GDIF system for representing gestures integrates OSC.

OSC is used extensively in experimental musical controllers, and has been built into several open source and commercial products.

The Open Sound World (OSW) music programming language is designed around OSC messaging.

OSC is the heart of the DSSI plugin API, an evolution of the LADSPA API, in order to make the eventual GUI interact with the core of the plugin via messaging the plugin host. LADSPA and DSSI are APIs dedicated to audio effects and synthesizers.

In 2007, a standardized namespace within OSC called SYN, for communication between controllers, synthesizers and hosts, was proposed,

Notable software with OSC implementations include:


Notable hardware with OSC implementations include:


== Design ==
OSC messages consist of an address pattern (such as codice_1), a type tag string (such as codice_2 for a float32 argument followed by an int32 argument), and the arguments themselves (which may include a time tag). Address patterns form a hierarchical name space, reminiscent of a Unix filesystem path, or a URL, and refer to &quot;Methods&quot; inside the server, which are invoked with the attached arguments. Type tag strings are a compact string representation of the argument types. Arguments are represented in binary form with four-byte alignment. The core types supported are

* 32-bit two&#x27;s complement signed integers
* 32-bit IEEE floating point numbers
* Null-terminated arrays of eight-bit encoded data (C-style strings)
* arbitrary sized blob (e.g. audio data, or a video frame)

An example message is included in the spec (with null padding bytes represented by ␀): codice_3, Followed by the 4-byte float32 representation of 440.0: 0x43dc0000.

Messages may be combined into bundles, which themselves may be combined into bundles, etc. Each bundle contains a timestamp, which determines whether the server should respond immediately or at some point in the future.

Applications commonly employ extensions to this core set. More recently some of these extensions such as a compact Boolean type were integrated into the required core types of OSC 1.1.

The advantages of OSC over MIDI are primarily internet connectivity; data type resolution; and the comparative ease of specifying a symbolic path, as opposed to specifying all connections as seven-bit numbers with seven-bit or fourteen-bit data types. This human-readability has the disadvantage of being inefficient to transmit and more difficult to parse by embedded firmware, however.

The spec does not define any particular OSC Methods or OSC Containers. All messages are implementation-defined and vary from server to server.

<text>Friedrich Karl Rudolf Bergius (, 11 October 1884 – 30 March 1949) was a German chemist known for the Bergius process for producing synthetic fuel from coal, Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1931, together with Carl Bosch) in recognition of contributions to the invention and development of chemical high-pressure methods. Having worked with IG Farben during World War II, his citizenship came into question following the war, causing him to ultimately flee to Argentina, where he acted as adviser to the Ministry of Industry.
==Early life==

Bergius was born near Breslau (Wrocław), then in the German Empire.

==Academic career==
Before studying chemistry, Bergius was sent to work for 6 months at the Friedrich Wilhelms steel works in Mülheim. His studies started at the University of Breslau in 1903 and ended with a PhD in chemistry at the University of Leipzig in 1907, after only 4 years. His thesis on sulfuric acid as solvent was supervised by Arthur Rudolf Hantzsch. In 1909 Bergius worked for one semester with Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch at the University of Karlsruhe in the development of the Haber-Bosch Process. On the same year he was invited to work at the Leibniz University Hannover with Max Bodenstein, who developed the idea of chemical kinetics and held a position as professor.

==Work==

===Synthetic fuel from coal===
During his habilitation, techniques for the high-pressure and high-temperature chemistry of carbon-containing substrates were developed, yielding a patent on the Bergius process in 1913. In this process liquid hydrocarbons used as synthetic fuel are produced by hydrogenation of lignite (brown coal). He developed the process well before the commonly known Fischer–Tropsch process. Theodor Goldschmidt invited him to build an industrial plant at his factory the Th. Goldschmidt AG in 1914. The production began only in 1919, after the World War I ended, when the need for fuel was already declining. The technical problems, inflation and the constant criticism of Franz Joseph Emil Fischer, which changed to support after a personal demonstration of the process, made the progress slow and Bergius sold his patent to BASF, where Carl Bosch worked on it. Before World War II several plants were built with an annual capacity of 4 million tons of synthetic fuel.

===Sugar from wood===
The hydrolysis of wood to produce sugar for industrial use became a hard task for Bergius. After he moved to Heidelberg he started to improve the process and planned an industrial scale production. The high costs and technical problems nearly led him to bankruptcy. A bailiff followed Bergius to Stockholm to get the money from his Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1931.

The autarky movement before the World War II boosted the process and several plants were built. Bergius moved to Berlin where he was only marginally involved in the development. While he was in Bad Gastein Austria, his laboratory and his house were destroyed by an air raid. The rest of the war he stayed in Austria.

===International engagement===
After the war his citizenship was called into question because of his collaboration with IG Farben, resulting in his departure from Germany to work as an adviser in Italy, Turkey, Switzerland and Spain. He emigrated to Argentina, where he worked as an adviser to the Ministry of Industry. He died in Buenos Aires on 30 March 1949, and is buried in the Cementerio Alemán next to La Chacarita Cemetery.

==Awards==

He and Carl Bosch won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1931 in recognition of their contributions to the invention and development of chemical high-pressure methods. In 1937, he was awarded the Wilhelm Exner Medal.

==Personal life==
Bergius was the father of Renate Burgess.

<text>The Christie suspension is a suspension system developed by American engineer J. Walter Christie for his tank designs. It allowed considerably longer movement than conventional leaf spring systems then in common use, which allowed his tanks to have considerably greater cross-country speed. The system was first introduced on his M1928 design, and used on all of his designs until his death in 1944.

== History ==

Christie advocated the use of lightweight tanks with long range and high speed, designed to penetrate enemy lines and attack their infrastructure and logistics capabilities.

A major problem with tanks in World War I was tracked suspension failure. Christie&#x27;s first tank design of 1919 could be driven on its wheels to get to the starting point and then the tracks fitted before it went into action. The US Tank Corps ordered a single tank from Christie&#x27;s company based on this design. The tank, known as the M1919, was delivered in early 1921 and tested until Christie proposed modifying it. The modifications added coil suspension to the front wheels and removed the turret - the armament being moved to the nose of the vehicle. The tank - now known as M1921 - was tested in 1922 and 1923 but considered lacking in maneuverability and internal space and so put into the Ordnance Museum at Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1924.

His earlier designs in the 1920s were hampered by poor cross-country performance due to limited suspension capability. The major problem he faced was the limited vertical space for springs to move in: for a 25 cm movement it might need 50 or 75 cm of vertical space for the spring and strut, and his small designs did not offer such space.

In the late 1920s he devised a better solution. The solution was the addition of a bellcrank, which changed the direction of motion from vertical to horizontal. The road wheels were individually mounted on a pipe that could move vertically only, at the top of which the bell crank rotated the direction of motion to the rear. Springs were mounted on the end of the crank, and could be as long as needed, lying along the inside of the hull. The result was a substantial increase in range of motion, from only some 10 cm in his original designs, to 25 cm on the M1928, 35 cm on the M1930, and 60 cm on the M1932.

The M1928 weighed under and had a Liberty engine; this allowed it to reach on tracks and on its wheels. For context, this is comparable to a luxury/performance passenger car of the era, faster than a typical car, and faster even than a modern main battle tank that tops out at approximately . The four sprung road wheels could move on top of the &quot;compression due to the weight of the vehicle&quot;. Although there was interest by the Army in the design, negotiations over the requirements were drawn out and a single Christie M1931 was delivered in March 1931 followed by an order for 7 more in June. These received official designation as &quot;Convertible Medium Tank T3&quot; and all seven were delivered by 1932. Four were given to the cavalry for testing. They had the main gun replaced with a heavy machine gun and were renamed &quot;Combat Car T1&quot;. The crew of two and relatively light armour was insufficient for the infantry support function the tank was expected to have. The Army drew up a specification for an improved T3 but following disputes with Christie the order - for 5 of the &quot;Convertible Medium Tank T3E2&quot; was given to the American-La France company.

The most famous Christie-based tanks, the Soviet BT tank series and the T-34, used coil springs mounted vertically (on the BT) or at a slight angle from vertical (the T-34).

Another feature of Christie&#x27;s designs was the &quot;convertible&quot; drive: the ability to remove the tracks for road travel, allowing for higher speeds and better range, and reducing wear on the fragile caterpillar track systems of the 1930s. In one public test 1931 in Linden, NJ, Army officials clocked a Christie M1931 tank attaining , making it the fastest tank in the world: a record many believe it still holds. There were no return rollers for the upper track run; the tracks were supported by the road wheels. As with many track designs with center guide teeth, dual wheels were used, allowing the guide teeth to run between them.

Because large road wheels and &quot;slack track&quot; are characteristic of the Christie suspension, other designs with these features are sometimes misidentified as such. The real Christie suspension was used only on a few designs, notably the Soviet BT tanks and T-34, the British Cruiser tanks, including the A13s: Cruiser Mk III, Cruiser Mk IV, Covenanter, Crusader, Cromwell and the Comet, as well as some experimental Polish and Italian designs. Post-T-34 Soviet tanks, while remaining outwardly similar, have actually used torsion bar suspension, as did the German tanks with Heinrich Kniepkamp and Ernst Lehr&#x27;s &quot;Schachtellaufwerke&quot; (interlaced running gear) suspension.

Later wartime developments simplified the suspension. By 1939, the Soviets found that the BT tank&#x27;s convertible drive was an unnecessary complication which occupied valuable space in the tank, and the feature was dropped in the T-34. The original Christie suspension used large rubber-rimmed road wheels but wartime rubber shortages forced some T-34 factories to use wheels with sprung steel rims to be used instead. Most T-34s continued to be built with rubber-rimmed tires.

<text>Alfredo Claudino Baptist Read Griffin (born October 6, 1957) is a Dominican former professional baseball player. He played shortstop in Major League Baseball (MLB) for four teams from 1976 to 1993.

==Playing career==
Griffin began his career as a member of the Cleveland Indians, who signed him as an amateur free agent in 1973. On December 5, 1978, before having played a full season in the majors, he was traded, along with Phil Lansford (minors), to the Toronto Blue Jays for Víctor Cruz. Griffin made an immediate impact, sharing the American League Rookie of the Year Award in 1979 with John Castino.

In 1980, Griffin led the majors in triples, tying Willie Wilson of the Kansas City Royals with 15; both Griffin and Wilson set an AL record for most triples in a single season by a switch-hitter. Five years later in 1985, Wilson himself shattered the record that he shared with Griffin by tallying 21 triples.

In 1984, Griffin was named to the All-Star team. This was explained by John Feinstein of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as: &quot;Making the All-Star team the hard way: Major league baseball pays the expenses for each player here and for one guest. In most cases, players bring wives or girlfriends. Dámaso García, the Toronto Blue Jays&#x27; second baseman, brought his shortstop, Alfredo Griffin. When the Tigers&#x27; Alan Trammell hurt his arm and could not play tonight, Manager Joe Altobelli named Griffin to the team, partly because he&#x27;s a fine player, but mostly because he was here.&quot;

Griffin spent six years with the Blue Jays from 1979 to 1984, playing in 392 consecutive games. He was traded after the 1984 season to the Oakland Athletics, where, despite his reluctance to draw walks and a tendency to be overaggressive on the basepaths, he began to harness the offensive promise that he showed in 1980. Griffin won the American League Gold Glove Award in 1985.
After establishing personal bests in most offensive categories with the Athletics, Griffin was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Bob Welch prior to the 1988 season. The three-team trade, which included the New York Mets, also netted the Dodgers Jay Howell and Jesse Orosco. All three teams involved in the deal would go on to win their respective divisions in 1988. A Dwight Gooden fastball broke Griffin&#x27;s hand in May 1988, causing him to miss some time, but he returned to start all 12 of the Dodgers&#x27; postseason games at shortstop in 1988, winning his first World Series title.

In 1990, Griffin became the last player to finish last in the National League, of those who qualified for the batting title, in batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage.

Griffin returned to Toronto in 1992 and was a bench player as the Blue Jays won the first of two consecutive championships. On October 23, 1993, he stood on deck as Joe Carter faced Mitch Williams in the ninth inning of Game Six. His career came to an end moments later when Carter homered to win the World Series for Toronto.

Griffin was the first player in major league history to have started three times for the opposing line-ups in a perfect game: against Len Barker (Cleveland) in 1981 for the Toronto Blue Jays, then against Tom Browning (Cincinnati) in 1988 and Dennis Martínez (Montreal) in 1991, both for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

Griffin ended his 18-year playing career with a .249 batting average, 24 home runs, 527 runs batted in, and a 67 OPS+ in 1,962 games played. Writer Bill James named Griffin the most aggressive baserunner of the 1980s.

==Coaching career==
Griffin coached for the Toronto Blue Jays in 1996 and 1997. He was the first base coach for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in MLB from 2000 to 2018, and also for the Estrellas Orientales (Eastern Stars) in his native Dominican Republic&#x27;s Winter League.

<doc id="384795" wikidata="Q7443679" url="?curid=384795" title="Second anointing">
<text>In the Latter Day Saint movement, the second anointing is the pinnacle ordinance of the temple and an extension of the endowment ceremony. Founder Joseph Smith taught that the function of the ordinance was to ensure salvation, guarantee exaltation, and confer godhood. In the ordinance, a participant is anointed as a &quot;priest and king&quot; or a &quot;priestess and queen&quot;, and is sealed to the highest degree of salvation available in Mormon theology.

In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Mormonism&#x27;s largest denomination, the ordinance is currently only given in secret to select couples whom top leaders say God has chosen. The LDS Church regularly performed the ceremony for nominated couples from the 1840s to the 1920s, and continued less regularly into the 1940s. By 1941, about 15,000 second anointings had been performed for the living, and over 6,000 for the dead. The practice became much less common thereafter, but has continued into modern times. Most modern LDS adherents are unaware of the ritual&#x27;s existence. Instructors in the church&#x27;s institutes of religion are told, &quot;Do &quot;not&quot; attempt in any way to discuss or answer questions about the second anointing.&quot; (emphasis in the original). The ordinance is also performed by many Mormon fundamentalist groups. However, it is not performed by denominations such as the Community of Christ, who historically did not practice the Nauvoo endowment ceremony.

==History==
===Under Smith (1842–1844)===
====First Performance of the Ritual====
Joseph Smith introduced the Nauvoo endowment in 1842, but stated that his work in establishing the &quot;fullness of the priesthood&quot; was not yet complete. In August 1843, church apostle Brigham Young stated that &quot;[i]f any in the Church had the fullness of the priesthood, he did not know it&quot;. Young understood that the &quot;fullness of the priesthood&quot; involved an anointing as &quot;king and priest&quot;, with the actual kingdom to be given after resurrection. The first time a Second Anointing was performed was on September 28, 1843, when Smith and one of his wives, Emma received it. During Smith&#x27;s lifetime, the second anointing was performed on at least 20 men and 17 women. Historian Gary James Bergera stated that the ordinance functioned as a de facto marriage sealing, though recipient Alpheus Cutler (founder of the Cutlerite branch of Mormonism) and two of his five wives (Abigail Andrews and Sally Cox) who also received the ordinance were not sealed at the time. Additionally, Orson Pratt and Parley P. Pratt received the ordinance without their wives. Many of the Anointed Quorum and Council of Fifty received their second anointing under Smith. About 40% of all male recipients of the ordinance in Smith&#x27;s lifetime were in polygamous marriages.

===LDS practice under Young (1842–1877)===
After Smith&#x27;s death, and the subsequent succession crisis, Young became leader for the majority of Smith&#x27;s adherents. In January 1846, he began administering the second anointing in the nearly completed Nauvoo Temple. Young re-administered the ordinance to many of those who had received it under Smith, and he delegated his authority to others, who performed nearly 600 second anointings (some to polygamous unions) before the temple was closed on February 7, 1846. After migration to the Salt Lake Valley, records don&#x27;t show the administration of further LDS second anointings for two decades (until 1866). Beginning in the 1870s, second anointings began to be performed vicariously for dead members of the church. 

===LDS practice under Taylor and after (1877–1950)===
In the 1880s, church president John Taylor was concerned that too many second anointings were being performed, and he instituted a series of procedural safeguards, requiring recommendation by a stake president, and a guideline that the ordinance &quot;belonged particularly to old men&quot;. In 1901, church president Lorenzo Snow further limited accessibility to the ordinance by outlining stringent criteria for worthiness.

By 1918, over 14,000 second anointings had been performed for the living and the dead. During the administration of church president Heber J. Grant in the 1920s, the frequency of second anointings was dramatically reduced. Stake presidents at the local congregation level were no longer permitted to recommend candidates for the ordinance; rather, recommendations could only be made by higher-ranking leaders in the Quorum of Twelve Apostles. By 1941, just under 15,000 second anointings had been performed for the living, and just over 6,000 for the dead. The church has not allowed historians to have access to second anointing records subsequent to 1941; therefore, the current frequency of second anointings is unknown. It is known that in 1942, 13 of the church&#x27;s 32 general authorities had not received the second anointing. In 1949, one apostle wrote the rite had been &quot;practically discontinued&quot;.

===Modern LDS practice===
Second anointings continue to be practiced in the modern-day church. The modern Latter-Day Saint practice is kept absolutely secret and is only given to a very small number of adherents, usually after a lifetime of loyal service to the church. One British former stake president and former area executive secretary, Tom Phillips, said his spouse and he had received the ordinance before his public disaffiliation. According to historian D. Michael Quinn, both the late church president Spencer W. Kimball (president from 1973—1985) and current church president Russell M. Nelson (president since 2018) received their second anointing in 1974; Nelson alluded to this experience in his 1979 autobiography.

===Eligibility===
Some members of the church were historically or are currently ineligible for the second anointing ordinance. All candidates for the rite cannot be single and must be temple married before receiving it, and between 1847 and 1978 all LDS endowment-related temple ordinances including the second anointing were denied to all members with Black ancestry. All temple ordinances continue to be denied for non-heterosexual couples and transgender couples as of 2023.

===Confidentiality===
The ordinance is currently only given confidentially to select couples, and most current LDS adherents are unaware of the ritual&#x27;s existence. Additionally, church class instructors are emphatically told not to discuss the ceremony at all. Historically, the church&#x27;s newspaper openly discussed the rite&#x27;s occurrence in print, and at least one obituary from a largely LDS Utah city mentioned the ordinance in 1909. In response to a researcher publishing an academic article on the topic in the 1980s the church banned him from future access to its historical archives and increased restrictions on public access. In 1978 Mark Hofmann forged a handwritten document purporting to be a historical description of the secret ordinance and sold it to Utah State University.

==Ceremony==
According to 19th-century journal entries and contemporary sources, the LDS second anointing ceremony consists of three parts:

# Prayer and Washing - First the couple and an officiator or two participate in a prayer circle (conducted by the husband) in a dedicated temple room, and then a male officiator washes only the husband&#x27;s feet.
# Anointing - Next the officiator anoints the husband as a king and priest to God, and then anoints the wife as a queen and priestess to her husband. For example, the following words were used by Heber C. Kimball during the second anointing of Brigham Young in the Nauvoo temple in 1846: &quot;Brother Brigham Young, I pour this holy consecrated oil upon your head and anoint thee a king and a priest of the most high God, over the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and unto all Israel. ... And I seal thee up unto eternal life, that thou shalt come forth in the morn of the first resurrection ... and thou shalt attain unto the eternal Godhead and receive a fulness of joy, and glory, and power; and that thou mayest do all things whatsoever is wisdom that thou shouldst do, even if it be to create worlds and redeem them.&quot;
# Washing of the Husband - Later, the wife symbolically prepares her husband for his death and resurrection as his priestess by washing and anointing the husband&#x27;s feet and then laying her hands on his head to give a blessing. This portion of the ceremony was historically done at home, in a room dedicated by the husband. Elder Hans Mattsson, and his wife Birgitta described that they were led into a private room that would normally be used for the Temple endowment, where a bowl of water and towel were prepared for Birgitta to wash Han&#x27;s feet and give him a Priesthood blessing.

Before 1846 the woman was also anointed as a &quot;priestess unto God,&quot; but Brigham Young changed the ceremony and readministered the rite such that the wife would now be a &quot;queen and priestess unto thine husband.&quot; The woman would also be exalted through her husband instead of through God, but only if she &quot;dost obey [her husband’s] counsel.&quot;

==Meaning and symbolism==
===First anointing meanings===
The &quot;first anointing&quot; refers to the washing and anointing part of the endowment ceremony, in which a person is anointed &quot;to become&quot; a king and priest or a queen and priestess unto God. In the second anointing, on the other hand, participants are anointed &quot;as&quot; a king and priest, or queen and priestess. When the anointing is given, according to Brigham Young, the participant &quot;will then have received the fulness of the Priesthood, all that can be given on earth.&quot; The &quot;first anointing&quot; promises blessings in the afterlife contingent on the patron&#x27;s faithfulness, while the second anointing actually bestows those blessings.

===Second anointing meanings===
Church leaders have stated that those who participate in the second anointing ordinance have received the &quot;fullness of the priesthood&quot;, their &quot;calling and election made sure&quot;, their eternal temple marriage &quot;sealed by the holy spirit of promise&quot;, and received the &quot;more sure word of prophecy&quot;, &quot;higher blessing,&quot; or &quot;second endowment&quot;. According to prominent 20th-century LDS Church apostle Bruce R. McConkie, those who have their calling and election made sure &quot;receive the more sure word of prophecy, which means that the Lord seals their exaltation upon them while they are yet in this life. ... [T]heir exaltation is assured.&quot;

The second anointing may have been intended to fulfill scriptural references to the &quot;fulness of the priesthood&quot;, such as that in Doctrine and Covenants, , a revelation by Joseph Smith commanding the building of a temple in Nauvoo, Illinois, in part, because &quot;there is not a place found on earth that he may come to and restore again that which was lost unto you, or which he hath taken away, even the &quot;fulness of the priesthood&quot;&quot; (emphasis added). LDS Church leaders have connected this ordinance with a statement by Peter in his second Epistle. In , he talks about making one&#x27;s &quot;calling and election sure,&quot; and further remarks, &quot;We have also a more sure word of prophecy&quot; (). Smith referenced this process in saying, &quot;When the Lord has thoroughly proved [a person], and finds that the [person] is determined to serve Him at all hazards, then the [person] will find his calling and election made sure&quot;.

===Feminine priestesshood===
The second anointing is performed only on married, heterosexual couples. Some writers have argued that because of this, women who receive the second anointing (in which they are anointed as &quot;priestesses&quot;) are ordained to the &quot;fulness of the priesthood&quot; in the same manner as their husbands. These scholars suggest that Smith may have considered these women to have, in fact, received the power of the priesthood, though not necessarily a specific priesthood office.

==Controversy and criticism==
The ceremony has been criticized and viewed as controversial. One former member stated that learning of the elitism and secrecy around the second anointing started him questioning LDS church authority. A 1910 Salt Lake Tribune editor&#x27;s criticism of LDS temple practices stated in a negative tone that one LDS leader who had received his &quot;second anointings&quot; prayed in 1867 for the damnation of all Americans.

Hans Mattsson, a former member of the area authority seventy spoke publicly about his experience receiving the second anointing in the Frankfurt Temple.

<doc id="384805" wikidata="Q125050" url="?curid=384805" title="Manhattan Bridge">
<text>The Manhattan Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the East River in New York City, connecting Lower Manhattan at Canal Street with Downtown Brooklyn at the Flatbush Avenue Extension. Designed by Leon Moisseiff and built by the Phoenix Bridge Company, the bridge has a total length of . The bridge is one of four vehicular bridges directly connecting Manhattan Island and Long Island; the nearby Brooklyn Bridge is just slightly farther west, while the Queensboro and Williamsburg bridges are to the north.

The bridge was proposed in 1898 and was originally called &quot;Bridge No. 3&quot; before being renamed the Manhattan Bridge in 1902. Foundations for the bridge&#x27;s suspension towers were completed in 1904, followed by the anchorages in 1907 and the towers in 1908. The Manhattan Bridge opened to traffic on December 31, 1909, and began carrying streetcars in 1912 and New York City Subway trains in 1915. The eastern upper-deck roadway was installed in 1922. After streetcars stopped running in 1929, the western upper roadway was finished two years later. The uneven weight of subway trains crossing the Manhattan Bridge caused it to tilt to one side, necessitating an extensive reconstruction between 1982 and 2004.

The Manhattan Bridge was the first suspension bridge to use a Warren truss in its design. It has a main span of between two suspension towers. The deck carries seven vehicular lanes, four on an upper level and three on a lower level, as well as four subway tracks, two each flanking the lower-level roadway. The span is carried by four main cables, which travel between masonry anchorages at either side of the bridge, and 1,400 vertical suspender cables. Carrère and Hastings designed ornamental plazas at both ends of the bridge, including an arch and colonnade in Manhattan that is a New York City designated landmark. The bridge&#x27;s use of light trusses influenced the design of other long suspension bridges in the early 20th century.

== Development ==
The bridge was the last of the three suspension spans built across the lower East River, following the Brooklyn and Williamsburg bridges. After the City of Greater New York was formed in 1898, the administration of mayor Robert Anderson Van Wyck formed a plan for what became the Manhattan Bridge; these plans were repeatedly revised and were not finalized until after George B. McClellan Jr. became mayor in 1901. From the outset, the bridge was planned to have a central roadway, streetcar tracks, elevated tracks, and sidewalks, and it was to run straight onto an extension of Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn.

In the earliest plans it was to have been called &quot;Bridge No. 3&quot;, but was given the name Manhattan Bridge in 1902. When the name was confirmed in 1904, &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized it as &quot;meaningless&quot;, lobbied for one after Brooklyn&#x27;s Wallabout Bay, and railed that the span &quot;would have geographical and historical significance if it were known as the Wallabout Bridge&quot;. In 1905, the &quot;Times&quot; renewed its campaign, stating, &quot;All bridges across the East River are Manhattan bridges. When there was only one, it was well enough to call it the Brooklyn Bridge, or the East River Bridge&quot;.

=== Planning and caissons ===
The earliest plans for what became the Manhattan Bridge were designed by R. S. Buck. These plans called for a suspension bridge with carbon steel wire cables and a suspended stiffening truss, supported by a pair of towers with eight braced legs. This design would have consisted of a main span of and approaches of each. In early 1901, the city government approved a motion to acquire land for a suspension tower in Brooklyn; the city shortly began soliciting bids for the tower&#x27;s foundations. The contract for the Brooklyn suspension tower was awarded in May 1901.

The caisson under the tower on the Brooklyn side was installed in March 1902; workers excavated dirt for the foundations from within the caisson, a process that was completed in December 1902. Three workers had died while working on the Brooklyn-side tower&#x27;s caisson. A plan for the bridge was announced in early 1903. Elevated and trolley routes would use the Manhattan Bridge, and there would be large balconies and enormous spaces within the towers&#x27; anchorages. Work on the Manhattan caisson had commenced in January 1903; it was towed to position in July, and the caisson work was completed by January 1904. The foundations were completed in March 1904. A $10 million grant for the bridge&#x27;s construction was granted in May 1904 with the expectation that work on the bridge would start later that year.

The Municipal Art Commission raised objections to one of the bridge&#x27;s plans in June 1904, which delayed the start of construction. Another set of plans was unveiled that month by New York City Bridge Commissioner Gustav Lindenthal, in conjunction with Henry Hornbostel. The proposal also called for each of the suspension towers to be made of four columns, to be braced transversely and hinged to the bottom of the abutments longitudinally. The same span dimensions from Buck&#x27;s plan were used because work on the masonry pier foundations had already begun. Additionally, the towers would have contained Modern French detail, while the anchorages would have been used for functions such as meeting halls. Lindenthal&#x27;s plan was also rejected due to a dispute over whether his plan, which used eyebars, was better than the more established practice of using wire cables. The Municipal Art Commission voted in September 1904 to use wire cables on the bridge.

Lindenthal was ultimately dismissed and a new design was commissioned from Leon Moisseiff. George Best replaced Lindenthal as the city&#x27;s bridge commissioner and discarded the eyebar plans in favor of the wire cables. Hornbostel was replaced by Carrère and Hastings as architectural consultants. By late 1904, the disputes over the types of cables had delayed the contract for the bridge&#x27;s superstructure (composed of its towers and deck). The bridge&#x27;s completion had been delayed by two years, and its cost had increased by $2 million. The cable dispute was not fully resolved until 1906, when Best&#x27;s successor James W. Stevenson announced that the bridge would use wire cables.

=== Anchorages, towers, and approach viaducts ===
Best reviewed bids for the construction of the anchorages in December 1904. The Williams Engineering Company received the $2 million contract for the anchorages&#x27; construction. Construction commenced on the Brooklyn anchorage in February 1905 and on the Manhattan anchorage that April. The foundation subcontractors excavated the foundations of each anchorage using sheet pilings. Barges were used to transport material from the East River to the anchorages&#x27; sites. Mixers constructed the masonry for the anchorages at a rate of up to per day. During mid-1905, officials condemned land in Manhattan and Brooklyn for the bridge&#x27;s approaches; the land acquisition was partially delayed because the contractors rented out houses that were supposed to be demolished. By the end of the year, the city&#x27;s bridge department was planning to erect streetcar terminal buildings at either end of the bridge.

To avoid the delays that had occurred during the Williamsburg Bridge&#x27;s construction, Best planned to award a single large contract for the towers and the deck, rather than splitting the work into multiple contracts. He began soliciting bids for the metalwork in July 1905, at which point the bridge was to use of metal. The Pennsylvania Steel Company received the contract in August 1905 after submitting a low bid of $7.248 million, and a competing bidder sued to prevent the contract from being awarded to Pennsylvania Steel. In November, a New York Supreme Court judge ruled that the contract with Pennsylvania Steel was illegal, as the bidding process had been designed to shut out other bidders. Although Best tried to appeal the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, the contract was re-advertised anyway; Pennsylvania Steel refused to submit another bid. When Stevenson became the bridge commissioner at the beginning of 1906, he ordered that new bridge specifications be created. Stevenson received bids for the steelwork in May 1906, and the Ryan-Parker Construction Company received the contract the next month, following delays caused by an injunction and threats of lawsuits.

The Ryan-Parker Company hired the Phoenix Bridge Company in September 1906 to fabricate the steelwork. The Phoenix Bridge Company&#x27;s 2,000 workers began making beams, girders, eyebars, and other parts of the bridge at the firm&#x27;s factory in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. The anchorages were less than half complete, in part because of inclement weather and material shortages. That November, the Board of Estimate and Apportionment approved $4 million for land acquisition in Manhattan and $300,000 for land acquisition in Brooklyn. By early 1907, the city had spent over $6 million on the bridge; the bridge&#x27;s total cost was estimated at $20 million. To speed up the bridge&#x27;s completion, Manhattan borough president Bird Sim Coler considered implementing night shifts. By February 1907, the Phoenix Bridge Company was manufacturing steel faster than it could be installed, and the steel for the anchorages was done. The company had also begun fabricating beams for the towers. Land acquisition for an extension of Flatbush Avenue to the bridge began in March, and the first steel girders of the towers were lifted in place the next month. The first steel pedestals for the towers were installed on June 26, 1907. The anchorages were nearly done by late 1907; they could not be completed until the cables were finished.

The city government acquired land for the approaches in October 1907; this required the relocation of several hundred families in Brooklyn and nearly 1,000 families in Manhattan. In total, about 145 lots in Brooklyn and 173 lots in Manhattan were obtained for the bridge&#x27;s approaches and plazas. Some Brooklyn residents requested additional time to relocate. Residents in the path of the Manhattan approach also protested efforts to evict them, though they were relocated at the beginning of December 1907. Later that month, four companies submitted bids for the construction of the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan and Brooklyn approach spans. John C. Rodgers submitted a low bid of $2.17 million for the viaducts, and Stevenson requested that amount from the Board of Estimate. By the beginning of 1908, most of the land had been cleared, and the suspension towers had been built to above the height of the deck. The Manhattan tower was finished that March, followed by the Brooklyn tower the next month. Land acquisition was nearly done by the middle of that year.

=== Cables and deck ===
Andrew McC. Parker of the Ryan-Parker Company had predicted in January 1908 that the cables would be strung within two months. The Roebling &amp; Sons Company started manufacturing the wires for the cables before the towers were finished, while the Glyndon Contracting Company was hired to lay the wires. Around of nickel steel wires were manufactured at the Carbon Steel Works in Pittsburgh. Workers began stringing temporary cables on June 15, 1908; the first wire broke loose while it was being strung, injuring two people. By this time, the construction cost had increased to $22 million. The temporary cables supported temporary footbridges between each tower, which were completed in mid-July. When the footbridges were finished, workers installed guide wires, which were laid as continuous loops. Two guide wheels, one at either end of each guide wire, carried the main cables&#x27; wires across the river between each anchorage. These wheels were powered by a motor atop the Brooklyn anchorage. In addition, reels of wire were stored at both ends of the bridge. The guide wheels laid up to of wire every day.

The last wires for the main cables were strung in December 1908. That month, the Board of Estimate and Apportionment hired engineer Ralph Modjeski to review the engineering drawings for the Manhattan Bridge, after the City Club of New York expressed concerns over the bridge&#x27;s safety. Afterward, the Glyndon Construction Company installed the vertical suspender cables, which were hung from the main cables. By the beginning of 1909, the bridge was planned to open at the end of the year, but the subway tracks, streetcar tracks, and Flatbush Avenue Extension were not complete. Around of red steel girders and floor panels for the bridge&#x27;s deck had been delivered to a yard in Bayonne, New Jersey. The girders and panels were delivered to the bridge&#x27;s site starting in February 1909, and the first floor panel in the main span was installed the same month. Each of the girders was hung from a pair of suspender cables, and floor panels were hung between the girders at a rate of four panels a day. It took workers three weeks to install the floor panels; and the last panel was installed on April 7, 1909.

The bridge commissioner received $1 million from the Board of Estimate and Apportionment for the completion of the roadway, subway tracks, and other design details. The trusses and side spans were built after the floor of the main span was completed. Carbon Steel began wrapping the main cables together in May 1909; the wrapping process required of wire, and the company was able to wrap five to seven segments of cables per day. All work on the cables was finished in August 1909, almost exactly a year after the first strand of the first main cable was strung. Workers then installed ornamentation on the tops of the towers and bronze collars on each of the main cables. Modjeski reported that September that the bridge was safe. At the time, the plazas were incomplete, and Flatbush Avenue Extension was unpaved; the bridge commissioner was razing buildings near the Manhattan plaza by that November. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; reported that there was widespread discontent over the fact that streetcar and subway service would not be ready for the bridge&#x27;s opening.

== Operational history ==

=== Opening and early history ===
Stevenson announced at the end of November 1909 that the bridge&#x27;s roadways would likely open by December 24, although the transit lines and pedestrian walkways were not complete. One hundred prominent Brooklyn citizens walked over the bridge on December 4, 1909; at the time, the subway tracks were unfinished, and there was uncertainty over which company would use the streetcar tracks. Outgoing mayor George B. McClellan Jr. toured the bridge on December 24. The span officially opened on December 31, 1909, at a final cost of $26 million, although work was still incomplete.Empty commercial vehicles tended to use the Manhattan Bridge, while trucks with full loads used the Brooklyn Bridge, since the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s wood-block pavement was less sturdy than the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s plank pavement.

A fire on the Brooklyn side damaged the bridge in early 1910, necessitating the replacement of some cables and steel. Though both of the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s footpaths were initially closed to the public, the northern footpath opened in July 1910; the southern footpath was scheduled to be opened the next month. Streetcars began running across the bridge in September 1912, and the bridge&#x27;s subway tracks opened in June 1915. By the mid-1910s, a food market operated under the bridge. Meanwhile, C. J. Sullivan sued the Ryan-Parker Construction Company, claiming that he had helped the company secure the general contract for the bridge. He was awarded just over $300,000 in 1912, an amount that was increased to over $380,000 in 1916.

After the bridge opened, Carrère and Hastings drew up preliminary plans for a Beaux Arts-style entrance to the bridge in Manhattan and a smaller approach on the Brooklyn side. The city&#x27;s Municipal Art Commission approved a $700,000 plan for the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan approach in April 1910. The final plans were approved in 1912, and construction began the same year. The city allocated $675,000 for a plaza at the Brooklyn end in March 1913, including a subway tunnel under the plaza, and the Northeastern Construction Company submitted the low bid for the plaza&#x27;s construction. The arch and colonnade were completed in 1915, while the pylons on the Brooklyn side were installed in November 1916. The bridge approaches cost just over $1.53 million to construct. In an attempt to speed up automotive traffic, in 1918, the New York City Police Department banned horse-drawn vehicles from crossing the bridge toward Brooklyn during the morning rush hour and toward Manhattan during the evening rush hour. One of the two streetcar lines across the bridge was discontinued in 1919.

=== 1920s to 1940s ===
During late 1920, the bridge&#x27;s roadway was used as a reversible lane between 7 am and 7 pm each day; this restriction caused heavy congestion. Grover Whalen, the commissioner of Plant and Structures, announced that September that he would request funding to repaint the bridge. The span was repainted during the next year at a cost of $240,000. Meanwhile, the bridge was carrying 27,000 daily vehicles by the early 1920s, and one traffic judge said the lower deck was too narrow to accommodate the increasing traffic levels on the bridge. In March 1922, the city government started constructing the eastern upper-deck roadway at a cost of $300,000. The roadway opened that June. The next month, Whalen banned horse-drawn vehicles from the Manhattan Bridge and motor vehicles from the Brooklyn Bridge. The upper roadway of the Manhattan Bridge was converted to a reversible lane, while the lower roadway carried two-way traffic at all times. Whalen said the restriction would allow both levels to be used to their full capacity; the decision ended up placing additional loads on the bridge.

To reduce congestion at the Manhattan end, left-hand traffic was implemented on the lower level during the 1920s, as most vehicles heading into Manhattan turned left at the end of the bridge. Motorists continued to use the Manhattan Bridge even after the Brooklyn Bridge reopened to motorists in 1925, contributing to heavy congestion during rush hours. At the time, the Brooklyn Bridge carried 10,000 vehicles a day (in part due to its low speed limit), while the Manhattan Bridge carried 60,000 vehicles daily. When the lower level was repaved in early 1927, Manhattan-bound traffic was temporarily banned from the lower level at night. That October, Brooklyn borough president James J. Byrne proposed replacing the Three Cent Line&#x27;s trolley tracks with a roadway; he estimated that it would cost $9 million to construct a brand-new roadway, while converting the trolley tracks would cost only $600,000. The comptroller approved the plan in September 1928, and the city formally voted to buy the Three Cent Line for just over $200,000 the following month. The Three Cent Line was discontinued in November 1929.

The Three Cent Line tracks were replaced by the western upper-deck roadway. Initially scheduled to be completed by July 1930, the roadway ultimately opened in June 1931 and carried Brooklyn-bound traffic. The eastern upper-deck roadway was converted to carry Manhattan-bound traffic, and the center roadway was turned into a lane for buses and trucks. At the time, nearly 65,000 vehicles used the bridge every day, of which nearly a quarter were buses and trucks. A set of 119 streetlights were installed on the upper level the following year. To increase traffic flow, both upper roadways were temporarily converted to reversible lanes during rush hours in 1934; the lower roadway was repaired, and the bridge was repainted the same year. The city&#x27;s commissioner of plant and structures also requested $725,000 in federal funds for various repairs. During 1937, the city awarded a contract to repair the bridge&#x27;s steelwork and raised the railings on the upper roadways. The city government announced in 1938 that it would replace the lower deck&#x27;s wooden pavement with a steel-and-concrete pavement; the repaving was completed that December. Simultaneously, the railings on the upper roadways were raised again.

As part of a Works Progress Administration project, a ramp at the Brooklyn end of the bridge was widened in 1941, replacing a dangerous reverse curve. By then, 90,000 vehicles a day used the span. An air raid siren was also installed on the bridge during World War II. By the mid-1940s, the Brooklyn approach to the bridge was one of the most congested areas in New York City.

=== 1950s to 1970s ===
The upper roadways were repaired during 1950. Similar repairs to the lower roadway were postponed until the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel opened, as the Brooklyn Bridge was also being rebuilt around the same time. To ease congestion, the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s western upper roadway began carrying Manhattan-bound traffic during the morning in March 1950. Floodlights and barbed-wire fences were installed at the bases of the bridge&#x27;s anchorages in 1951, during the Cold War, and the anchorages themselves were sealed to protect against sabotage. Manhattan-bound traffic stopped using the western upper roadway during the morning in August 1952. Instead, two of the three lower-level lanes began carrying Manhattan-bound traffic during the morning; previously, Manhattan-bound vehicles could use only one of the lower-level lanes at all times. By the mid-1950s, there were frequent car accidents on the Manhattan Bridge, which injured 411 people and killed nine people between 1953 and 1955 alone. In addition, the bridge carried nearly 79,000 cars, 18,000 trucks, and 200 buses on an average day.

==== 1950s repair project ====

The city&#x27;s public works commissioner, Frederick H. Zurmuhlen, requested in early 1952 that the Board of Estimate hire David B. Steinman to thoroughly examine the Manhattan Bridge, saying its maintenance costs were disproportionately higher than those of the other East River bridges. A beam on the eastern side of the bridge cracked in April 1953 and was fixed within a month. Following the cracked-beam incident, Zurmuhlen asked the city to allocate $2.69 million to repair the bridge, as trains disproportionately used one side of the bridge, causing it to tilt. Two proposals were put forth for the bridge&#x27;s subway tracks; one plan called for them to be moved to the center of the deck, while another plan called for the construction of an entirely new tunnel for subway trains. The administration of mayor Robert F. Wagner tentatively approved a $30 million renovation of the bridge in July 1954, and a committee of engineers was hired to review alternate proposals for the bridge. Zurmuhlen said the bridge&#x27;s safety would be compromised within the next decade if subway trains continued to use the bridge.

By February 1955, the city had hired a contractor to repair the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s cable bands and hangers for $2.2 million. Before these repairs could begin, engineers surveyed the bridge. When work on the cables began in June, access to the western upper roadway was severely reduced. That September, the eastern upper roadway was closed for repairs; the western upper roadway was used by Manhattan-bound traffic during weekday mornings and carried two-way traffic at other times. The bridge was temporarily closed to all traffic in November 1955. The eastern upper roadway was again closed during the midday in early 1956 for suspender cable repairs, and the whole span was closed during nights in June 1956. All lanes were again open by that August. The city had still not decided whether to move the subway tracks to a double-deck structure in the middle of the bridge, even though that plan would have reduced strain on the cables. For unknown reasons, the tracks were never moved.

==== Other modifications ====
Plans for the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway in Brooklyn, which was constructed in the 1950s, included ramps to the Manhattan Bridge. Lane control lights were installed above the bridge&#x27;s reversible lower-level lanes in early 1958, and fixed red and green lights were installed on the upper-level roadways. The same year, the city spent $50,000 on repairs after two boats collided on the East River, causing an explosion that scorched the bridge. The city announced in 1959 that it would rebuild the upper roadways to accommodate trucks. The Karl Koch Engineering Company received a contract to rebuild the upper roadways; the project was planned to cost $6.377 million. The eastern upper roadway was closed for repairs in September 1960; the project also included fixing the lower deck and building ramps from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. After the eastern upper roadway reopened in November 1961, the western upper roadway was closed, and the eastern upper roadway was temporarily used as a reversible lane. Work proceeded several months ahead of schedule.

In conjunction with the upgrades to the upper roadways, in June 1961, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses proposed demolishing the plazas on both sides and connecting the bridge to new expressways. The bridge would have linked the Lower Manhattan Expressway with the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, though the former was never built. The city&#x27;s art commission delayed the demolition of the plazas before ruling that the pylons in the Brooklyn plaza be relocated to the Brooklyn Museum or another suitable location. Wagner said in late 1962 that he would request $2.9 million to rebuild the approaches at both ends of the bridge; the work included a widening of an approach road at the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan end. The pylons flanking the Brooklyn approach were moved to the Brooklyn Museum in 1963. The western upper roadway was closed for repairs for a year beginning in August 1969. Two of the lower roadway&#x27;s lanes were closed for four months starting in November 1970 so workers could replace faulty joints.
=== Late 20th- and early 21st-century renovation ===

The weight of the subway trains had caused deep and widespread cracks to form in the bridge&#x27;s floor beams, prompting the city government to replace 300 deteriorated beams during the late 1970s. The deck twisted up to every time a train passed by, and trains had to slow down on the bridge. A &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter wrote that diagonal cable stays might eventually need to be installed; the city government also contemplated installing support towers under the side spans. The bridge&#x27;s condition was blamed on the imbalance in the number of trains crossing the bridge, as well as deferred maintenance during the New York City fiscal crisis of the 1970s. In 1979, the New York state government took over control of the Queensboro, Williamsburg, Manhattan, and Brooklyn bridges. One engineer estimated in 1988 that the bridge would cost $162.6 million to repair.

==== Late 1970s and 1980s ====
The state government started inspecting the Manhattan Bridge and five others in 1978. The same year, the United States Congress voted to allocate money to repair the bridge, as well as several others in New York City. After the presidential administration of Ronald Reagan questioned whether the congressional funding should cover the subway tracks&#x27; restoration, the U.S. government agreed in 1981 to fund restoration both of the roadways and of the subway tracks. By the early 1980s, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) planned to spend $100 million on bridge repairs. The New York City government allocated $10.1 million for preliminary work on the bridge in March 1982, and minor repair work started that year. Workers planned to install brackets and supports under the deck, and they drilled small holes into the lower-level floor beams unsuccessful attempt to prevent the beams from cracking further. An overhaul of the bridge began in April 1985, and the city received $60 million in federal funds for the renovations of the Queensboro, Manhattan, and Brooklyn bridges the same year. The north tracks were closed that August, reopening that November after an $8.1 million repair.

The eastern upper roadway was temporarily closed starting in April 1986, and all northbound traffic was shifted to the lower level, as part of a $45 million project to replace the roadway and its steel supports. The north tracks underneath were closed that month. The roadway was originally supposed to reopen within 15 months, but contractors found that one of the anchors for the main cables was far more corroded than anticipated, delaying the eastern roadway&#x27;s reopening by another 18 months. The renovation of the Manhattan Bridge was behind schedule by the end of 1986, in part because of the corrosion. Legal issues, traffic reroutes, and concerns about the capabilities of the main contractor were also cited as causes for the delays in the renovation. Inspectors subsequently found that twenty of the girders below the lower deck had cracks as much as wide. Due to the cracks on the lower level, in December 1987, inspectors shut one lane of the lower level and banned buses and trucks from the two remaining lower-level lanes. The city government agreed to pay $750,000 to fix the cracks.

In 1988, the NYCDOT published a list of 17 structurally deficient bridges in the city, including the Manhattan Bridge. That year, inspectors identified 73 &quot;flags&quot; or potentially serious defects, compared to the five defects identified in a 1978 inspection. As a result, the general contractor was ousted in August 1988, and the New York State Department of Transportation had to hire another contractor, increasing the project&#x27;s cost. The eastern roadway of the Manhattan Bridge reopened in December 1988; the north tracks also reopened at that time, and the south tracks were closed. Although the NYCDOT had planned to halt work for 16 months, the western roadway was closed for emergency repairs in February 1989 after two corroded beams sagged. &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that the western roadway had urgently required repair for almost three years but had remained open to avoid shutting down all four of the bridge&#x27;s subway tracks at once. The cables, trusses, and subway frame on the eastern half of the bridge had to be repaired, and the lower roadway needed complete replacement. After seven columns supporting the Brooklyn approach were found to be cracked or corroded, these columns were repaired in late 1989.

==== 1990s ====
By the end of 1990, engineers found that the bridge&#x27;s support beams had thousands of cracks. Service on the south tracks resumed in December 1990, despite warnings the structure was unsafe; they had to be closed again after the discovery of corroded support beams and missing steel plates. The north-side tracks also had to be closed periodically to repair cracks. In the aftermath of the dispute, two city officials were fired, and the New York City Council&#x27;s Transportation committee held inquiries on the reopening of the south tracks and the safety of all New York City bridges. They found that the NYCDOT and MTA&#x27;s lack of cooperation contributed significantly to the deteriorating conditions. There were also allegations that the NYCDOT&#x27;s transportation commissioner was not properly addressing concerns about the bridge&#x27;s safety. Starting in January 1991, trucks and buses were banned from the lower roadway, which was also closed for repairs during nights and weekends. Meanwhile, the weight of heavy trucks created holes in the upper roadbed, so a three-ton weight limit was imposed.

The NYCDOT selected the Yonkers Contracting Company as the bridge&#x27;s main contractor in early 1992, and the firm was awarded a $97.8 million contract that August. City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman originally denied the contract to the company because of concerns about corruption, but she was overridden by Mayor David Dinkins, who wanted to complete repairs quickly. The NYCDOT began conducting more frequent inspections of the bridge after inspectors found holes in beams that had been deemed structurally sound during previous inspections. A shantytown at the Manhattan end of the bridge became one of the city&#x27;s largest homeless encampments before it was razed in 1993. The western upper roadway was closed for reconstruction that year. As part of an experiment, researchers from Mount Sinai Hospital monitored lead levels in Manhattan Bridge workers&#x27; blood while the reconstruction took place.

The bridge repairs were repeatedly delayed as the renovation process uncovered more serious structural problems underlying the bridge. The original plans had been to complete the renovations by 1995 for $150 million, but by 1996, the renovation was slated to be complete in 2003 at a cost of $452 million. The western upper roadway did not reopen until 1996.

==== 2000s ====
By 2001, it was estimated that the renovations had cost $500 million to date, including $260 million for the west side and another $175 million for the east side. At the time, the NYCDOT had set a January 2004 deadline for the renovation. The eastern upper roadway was closed for a renovation starting in 2002. The original pedestrian walkway on the west side of the bridge was reopened in June 2001, having been closed for 20 years. It was shared with bicycles until late summer 2004, when a dedicated bicycle path was opened on the east side of the bridge. The bike path was poorly signed, leading to cyclist and pedestrian conflicts. By the time work on the bridge was completed in 2004, the final cost of the renovation totaled $800 million. The lower-level roadway was then renovated between 2004 and 2008.

The arch and colonnade had also become deteriorated, having become covered with graffiti and dirt. The enclosed plaza within the colonnade had been used as a parking lot by the New York City Police Department, while the only remaining portion of the large park surrounding the arch and colonnade, at Canal and Forsyth Streets, had accumulated trees. The arch and colonnade themselves had open joints in the stonework, as well as weeds, bushes, and small trees growing at their top. The arch and colonnade were restored starting in the late 1990s, with the restoration being completed in April 2001 for $11 million. The project entailed cleaning the structures and installing 258 floodlights.

=== Late 2000s to present ===
To celebrate the bridge&#x27;s centennial, a series of events and exhibits were organized by the New York City Bridge Centennial Commission in October 2009. These included a ceremonial parade across the Manhattan Bridge on the morning of October 4 and a fireworks display in the evening. In 2009, the bridge was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. An $834 million project to replace the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s suspension cables was announced in 2010. The work was scheduled to take two years.

The lower roadway was permanently reconfigured in July 2015 to carry traffic toward Manhattan only; prior to this change, the lower roadway carried traffic toward Brooklyn for six hours every afternoon. The same year, the NYCDOT began allowing Brooklyn-bound drivers to exit onto Concord Street in Brooklyn at all times; previously, drivers could only exit onto Concord Street during the afternoon rush hours. The Concord Street exit was again closed outside the afternoon rush hour in early 2016. After rubble was found in Brooklyn Bridge Park under the Brooklyn approach in 2018, Skanska was given a contract to repair parts of the bridge at a cost of $75.9 million. The renovation was scheduled to finish in early 2021. The work entailed replacing some fencing, installing some new steel beams on the spans, and refurbishing ornamental elements on the towers. For instance, the spherical finials atop the suspension towers were replaced with cast-iron copies.

== Description ==

The bridge, including approaches but excluding plazas, is about long. The bridge reaches a maximum height of above mean high water at the middle of the river. The main span between the two suspension towers is long. The side spans, between the anchorages and the suspension towers on either side, are long. When the bridge was built, the Manhattan approach and plaza were quoted as being long, while the Brooklyn approach and plaza were quoted as measuring long. The bridge&#x27;s dead load is , and its live load is .

The bridge was designed by Leon Moisseiff. The plans for Manhattan Bridge are sometimes mistakenly attributed to Gustav Lindenthal, who was the city&#x27;s bridge commissioner before he was fired in 1904. The steel was fabricated by the Phoenix Bridge Company.

=== Deck ===
The Manhattan Bridge has four vehicle lanes on the upper level, split between two roadways carrying opposite directions of traffic. The southbound roadway to Brooklyn is on the west side of the bridge, while the northbound roadway to Manhattan is on the east side. The lower level has three Manhattan-bound vehicle lanes (formerly reversible until 2015) and four rapid transit/subway tracks, two under each of the upper roadways. Also on the lower level are a walkway on the south (geographically facing west) and a bikeway on the north side (geographically facing east). Originally, there were four streetcar tracks above the four rapid transit tracks. Although both levels could theoretically have accommodated either streetcars or elevated rapid transit, subways could use only the lower level because subway trains would have needed to climb an excessively steep slope to reach the upper level.

The deck is wide. As designed, the lower-level roadway was or wide. The walkway and bikeway were each or wide. The Manhattan-bound (eastern) upper-level roadway is wide, while the Brooklyn-bound (western) roadway is wide; both roadways narrow to at the anchorages. At the Brooklyn end of the south pathway, a staircase leads to the intersection of Jay and High streets. Because the subway trains are on the outer edges of the deck, this causes torsional stresses every time a train crossed the bridge. As built, the bridge sagged by as much as when a train crossed it, and it took about 30 seconds for the deck to return to its normal position after a train had passed. The floor beams under the lower level are thick.

The Manhattan Bridge was the first suspension bridge to employ Josef Melan&#x27;s deflection theory for deck stiffening. The theory posited that the weight of a suspension bridge&#x27;s deck, and the downward forces created by vehicles on the bridge, provided stability to the bridge&#x27;s deck; thus, such a bridge could use lighter trusses. As such, the Manhattan Bridge was the first suspension bridge in the world to use a lightly-webbed weight-saving Warren truss. There are four stiffening trusses, two each flanking the tracks on the north and south sides of the bridge; these trusses measure or deep. Each of the trusses is directly beneath one of the main cables. The centerlines of the inner trusses are apart from each other, while the centerline of each of the outer trusses is spaced from the centerlines of the inner trusses. The bottom of each truss is connected to the steel beams under the lower level, while the top of each truss supports the upper-level roadways. The trusses distribute the bridge&#x27;s weight between each vertical suspender cable.

=== Towers ===

The Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s suspension towers measure from the mean high water mark to the tops of the cables; the ornamental finials atop each tower are above high water. Each tower sits on a masonry pier that measures across and projects above mean high water. The tops of each pier taper to a steel pedestal measuring , from which rise the columns of each tower. The foundations of each tower, consisting of the underwater section of each pier and a caisson below it, descend below mean high water. The caissons measure across. They have concrete walls and contained a working chamber divided into three compartments.

Each tower is made of of steel, much heavier than the towers of similar suspension bridges. The towers are composed of four columns oriented transversely (perpendicularly) to the deck, one each flanking the north and south roadways. The columns measure wide, as measured transversely. The length of each column, as measured laterally, tapers from at the pedestal to at the top. The columns are braced by diagonal steel beams. A publication from 1904 wrote that the central parts of each tower were designed like a &quot;great open arch&quot;, making it possible to rebuild either the western or eastern halves of the bridge without affecting the structural integrity of the other half.

The towers contain little decorative detail, except for spherical finials. Each suspension tower contains an iron and copper hood over the pedestrian or bike path on either side, as well as iron cornices just below the tops of the towers. Saddles carry the main cables above the tops of each suspension tower. Each saddle weighs . In contrast to the Williamsburg and Brooklyn bridges (where the saddles are placed on movable rollers), the saddles are fixed in place, as the towers themselves were intended to flex slightly to accommodate the strains placed on each cable. If the bridge was loaded to full capacity, the tops of the towers could bend up to toward the center of the river. The steel beams also expanded by up to just sitting in the sun.

=== Cables ===
The Manhattan Bridge contains four main cables, which measure long. They descend from the tops of the suspension towers and help support the deck. The cables weigh a combined and can carry including the weight of the cables themselves. The cables measure either , , or in diameter. Unlike the Williamsburg Bridge (but like other suspension bridges), the wires on the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s cables are galvanized to prevent rusting. Each cable consists of 9,472 parallel wires, which are grouped into 37 strands of 256 wires. The wires measure across. The cables themselves are capable of resisting loads of up to .

There are 1,400 vertical suspender cables, which hang from the main cables and hold up the deck. They measure about in diameter and weigh a total of . Each suspender can withstand up to of pressure. There are cable bands at the top of each suspender cable (where they attach to the main cable); the suspenders are attached to the main cables using clamps. The lower parts of the suspender cables pass through the trusses. To reduce chafing on the lower parts of the suspender cables, workers installed wooden buffers between the suspender cables and the trusses after the bridge was completed.

=== Anchorages ===
The cables are attached to stone anchorages on each side, measuring long, wide, and tall. Each anchorage weighs and is filled with of concrete and rubble masonry. Inside the anchorages are 36 anchor bars, nine for each cable. The ends of each strand are attached to the anchor bars, which in turn are attached to eyebars measuring long. There are 37 eyebars connecting each cable to the anchor bars, distributing the loads on the cables across a larger area.

The anchorages were intentionally wider than the deck, providing space for pedestrians to rest; these pedestrian areas are above the ground. The facade of each anchorage is made of concrete and is topped by a colonnade measuring long. Each colonnade is divided vertically into five bays. The arches and colonnades are the only decorative elements of each anchorage. Early proposals for the anchorages called for them to include auditoriums, but this proposal was never executed. In a 1909 article for the &quot;Architectural Record&quot;, architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler described the anchorages as having &quot;an aspect of Egyptian immobility&quot;, and another author in 2006 similarly compared the anchorages to &quot;vast, battered, Egyptian masses&quot;.

At the base of the Manhattan anchorage is an arch measuring wide and 46 feet tall, through which Cherry Street passes. Water Street passes through a similar arch in Brooklyn. The intersection of Adams and Water streets had to be relocated to make way for the Brooklyn anchorage. The archway under the Brooklyn anchorage contains a public plaza. The sides of the anchorages have large buttresses that slope upward.

===Approach plazas===
Carrère and Hastings designed approach plazas on both ends of the bridge. At the time of the bridge&#x27;s opening, these plazas were meant to conceal views of the Manhattan Bridge from the streets on either end. The Manhattan plaza connects directly with Canal Street and the Bowery, while the Brooklyn end of the bridge continues as Flatbush Avenue (which in turn intersects several other roads at Prospect Park). The city paid Carl Augustus Heber, Charles Cary Rumsey, and Daniel Chester French a combined $41,000 () to design sculptures around the approach plazas.

====Manhattan plaza====
In Manhattan, the bridge terminates at a plaza originally bounded by the Bowery and Bayard, Division, Forsyth, and Canal streets. This plot covered . The arch and colonnade were completed within this plaza in 1915; they surround an elliptical plaza facing northwest toward the Bowery.

===== Design =====
The arch and colonnade are made of white, fine-grained Hallowell granite. They are decorated with two groups of allegorical sculptures by Heber and a frieze called &quot;Buffalo Hunt&quot; by Rumsey. The design of the arch and colonnade reference the fact that the Manhattan Bridge continues into Brooklyn as Flatbush Avenue, which runs south to the Atlantic Ocean. The arch thus signified the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s role as an ocean &quot;gateway&quot;. The plaza was influenced by the New York Improvement Plan of 1907, which sought to create plazas and other open spaces at large intersections; a massive circular plaza, connecting the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges, was never built.

The arch was based on Paris&#x27;s Porte Saint-Denis. It is one of the city&#x27;s three remaining triumphal arches, the others being the Washington Square Arch and the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Arch. The arch&#x27;s opening measures high and wide. On the northern side of the arch, the opening is flanked by carvings of classical ships, masks, shields, and oak leaves. The western pier contains the sculptural group &quot;Spirit of Commerce&quot;, depicting a winged woman flanked by two figures. The eastern pier contains &quot;Spirit of Industry&quot;, depicting the god Mercury flanked by two figures. The arch&#x27;s keystone contains a depiction of a bison. Above is the &quot;Buffalo Hunt&quot; frieze, which depicts Native Americans hunting animals while on horseback. The relief is topped by dentils and egg-and-dart ornamentation. The cornice of the arch contains modillions as well as six lion heads. The interior of the arch contains a coffered ceiling. There are rosettes on the arch&#x27;s soffit. The southern side of the arch, facing Brooklyn, is less ornately decorated but has rusticated stone blocks indicative of a Parisian or Florentine bank. On the southern side, there are decorations of carved lions at the bases of each pier.

The colonnade and plaza was modeled after the one surrounding St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Vatican City. The colonnade is elliptical and rises to . It is supported by six pairs of Tuscan columns on either side, with each pair of columns flanking rusticated piers inside the colonnade. Above each column is a stone with a classical motif, such as a boat or a cuirass. There is an entablature above the columns, as well as a cornice and balustrade at the top of the colonnade. The entablature contains roundels with floral motifs. The arch and colonnade were initially surrounded by granite retaining walls that contained decorative balustrades surrounding parkland on either side of the arch and colonnade. Only a small segment of parkland remains at Canal and Forsyth streets, while the south side of the park became Confucius Plaza.

===== Reception and modifications =====
&quot;American Architect and Architecture&quot; described the arch and colonnade in 1912 as &quot;worthy of one of the principal gateways of a great modern city&quot;. The arch and colonnade were described as a &quot;complete, dignified and monumental ensemble, worthy of one of the principal gateways of a great modern city&quot; in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article. &quot;The Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; wrote: &quot;The Manhattan Bridge will be not only something to get across the East River upon, but the sight of it will be a joy even to those who have no occasion to cross it.&quot; According to &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, the plaza&#x27;s presence &quot;has turned a section of the East Side, in one of its most squalid parts, into a veritable park where children can find on summer evenings a clean open place amid surroundings that will be in many ways the equal of any in New York&quot;.

From the bridge&#x27;s completion, the arch was heavily used by vehicular traffic. When the second Madison Square Garden was being demolished in 1925, there was a proposal to relocate the arena&#x27;s statue of Diana to the arch, but this did not happen. Part of the colonnade&#x27;s eastern arm was removed and replaced in the 1970s for the construction of the incomplete Second Avenue Subway. The arch and colonnade were designated a New York City landmark on November 25, 1975. After many years of neglect and several attempts by traffic engineers to remove the structure (including a proposal for the unbuilt Lower Manhattan Expressway that would have required removing the arch), the arch and colonnade were repaired and restored in 2000.

==== Brooklyn plaza ====
The Brooklyn approach to the Manhattan Bridge also contained a terraced plaza with balustrades. The Brooklyn plaza was originally bounded by Sands, Bridge, Nassau, and Jay streets. French designed a pair of pylons named &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;Manhattan&quot; on the Brooklyn side of the Manhattan Bridge. These were installed in November 1916. Each pylon measured high and rested on a base off the ground. The statues on each pylon represented French&#x27;s impressions of life in each borough. The &quot;Brooklyn&quot; pylon depicted a young woman with a child and symbols of art and progress, while the &quot;Manhattan&quot; pylon depicted a seated, upright woman with symbols of art and prosperity. There were granite railings and walkways at the base of either pylon.

A bas-relief memorializing former mayor William Jay Gaynor was dedicated at the bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn plaza in 1927; it was relocated in 1939 to the nearby Brooklyn Bridge Plaza. The pylons were relocated to the Brooklyn Museum in 1963. The pylons never constituted a true portal, even when they were in place. Following their removal, the Brooklyn approach did not contain a formal entrance.

=== Exit list ===
Access to the Manhattan Bridge is provided by a series of ramps on both the Manhattan and Brooklyn sides of the river.




=== Proposed I-478 designation ===
As early as the 1940s, there had been plans for an expressway running across Manhattan, connecting with the bridge. As part of the Interstate Highway System, the I-478 route number was proposed in 1958 for a branch of the Lower Manhattan Expressway running along the Manhattan Bridge. This highway would have run between I-78 (which would have split to another branch that used the Williamsburg Bridge) and I-278. The state government solicited bids for a ramp connecting the expressway to the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan end in 1965. The Lower Manhattan Expressway project was canceled in March 1971, and the I-478 designation was applied to the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. A fragment of the never-built expressway&#x27;s onramp still exists above the Manhattan side of the bridge&#x27;s center roadway.

== Public transportation ==
The bridge was originally intended to carry four Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation or BMT) subway tracks on the lower level, as well as four trolley tracks on the upper level. The trolley tracks were carried around the Manhattan side&#x27;s colonnade, while the subway tracks did not emerge from street level until south of the colonnade.

===Streetcar and bus service===
Before the bridge opened, the BRT and the Coney Island and Brooklyn Rail Road (CI&amp;B) both submitted bids to run streetcar service on the bridge, as did the Triborough Railroad Company. The Manhattan Bridge Three Cent Line received a permit to operate across the bridge in July 1910, despite opposition from the BRT and CI&amp;B. The Three Cent Line still had not begun operating by 1911, when another firm, the Manhattan Bridge Service Company, applied for a franchise to operate streetcars across the bridge. After a subcommittee of the Board of Estimate recommended that the Brooklyn and North River Line receive a franchise, both the Three Cent Line and the Brooklyn and North River Line received franchises to operate across the bridge in mid-1912.

Due to disputes over the franchises, the Three Cent Line did not run across the bridge until September 1912; it carried passengers between either of the bridge&#x27;s terminals. The Brooklyn and North River Line began operating in December 1915, and a bus route started running across the bridge after the Brooklyn and North River Railroad Company stopped operating streetcars across the bridge in October 1919. The Three Cent Line trolley was discontinued in November 1929 and replaced by a bus. A tour bus service, Culture Bus Loop II, began running across the bridge in 1973 and was discontinued in 1982. The B51 bus began running across the bridge in 1985 as part of a pilot program; the route was discontinued in 2010. , no MTA Regional Bus Operations routes use the bridge.

===Subway service===
Four subway tracks are located on the lower deck of the bridge, two on each side of the lower roadway. The two tracks on the west side of the bridge (known as the south tracks) are used by the Q train at all times and the N train at all times except late nights, when it uses the Montague Street Tunnel. The tracks on the east side (known as the north tracks) are used by the D train at all times and the B train on weekdays. For both pairs of tracks, the western track carries southbound trains, and the eastern track carries northbound trains. On the Manhattan side, the south tracks connect to Canal Street and become the express tracks of the BMT Broadway Line, while the north tracks connect to the Chrystie Street Connection through Grand Street and become the express tracks on the IND Sixth Avenue Line. On the Brooklyn side, the two pairs merge under Flatbush Avenue to a large junction with the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and BMT Brighton Line at DeKalb Avenue.

In Brooklyn, the tracks have always connected to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and the BMT Brighton Line; the junction between the lines was reconstructed in the 1950s. On the Manhattan side, the two north tracks originally connected to the BMT Broadway Line (where the south tracks now connect) while the two south tracks curved south to join the BMT Nassau Street Line towards Chambers Street. As a result of the Chrystie Street Connection, which linked the north tracks to the Sixth Avenue Line upon completion in 1967, the Nassau Street connection was severed. There were also unbuilt plans in the 1960s to have Long Island Rail Road trains use the subway tracks.

====Trackage history====

The New York City Rapid Transit Commission recommended the construction of a subway line across the Manhattan Bridge in 1905, and this line was approved in 1907 as part of the Nassau Street Loop. Unsuccessful proposals for rapid transit across the bridge included a two-track line for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and a two-track extension of a four-track BRT elevated line. The New York City Public Service Commission requested permission to start constructing the subway tracks in March 1909. Amid financial difficulties, and uncertainty over what subway lines would connect to the bridge in Brooklyn, the subway tracks were approved in May 1909. The subway tracks on the Manhattan Bridge opened on June 22, 1915, along with the Fourth Avenue Line and the Sea Beach Line. Initially, the north tracks carried trains to Midtown Manhattan via the Broadway Line, while the south tracks carried Sea Beach trains that terminated at Chambers Street.

When the Nassau Street Loop was completed on May 29, 1931, service on the south tracks declined, and traffic disproportionately used the north tracks. Trains from the Sea Beach, Brighton, and West End lines used the north tracks, while the south tracks were used only by short-turning trains from the West End and Culver lines. Approximately three times as many trains were using the north tracks than the south tracks by 1953, and 92 percent of subway trains used the north tracks by 1956. The Chrystie Street Connection opened on November 26, 1967, with a connection to the north tracks; the south tracks were rerouted to the Broadway Line, while the Nassau Line was disconnected from the bridge.

Repairs to the tracks commenced in August 1983, requiring closures of some subway tracks for three months. Further repairs occurred in 1985. The north tracks were closed for a longer-term repair in April 1986. The north tracks were reopened and the south tracks were closed simultaneously in December 1988. A projection for a reopening date was initially made for 1995. That year, the north tracks were closed during off-peak hours for six months. The south tracks finally reopened on July 22, 2001, whereby the north tracks were again closed. The south tracks was closed on weekends from April to November 2003. On February 22, 2004, the north tracks were reopened.

====Tracks used====
1967–1986
1986–1988: North tracks closed
1988–2001: South tracks closed


2001–2005: North tracks closed
2013–2014: Montague Street Tunnel closed
2005–2013, 2014-present

==Tolls==

Initially, motorists had to pay a ten-cent toll, the same as the toll on the Brooklyn Bridge. Shortly after the Manhattan Bridge opened, the city government conducted a study and found that it had no authority to charge tolls on the Manhattan and Queensboro bridges. Tolls on the Manhattan Bridge, as well as the Queensboro, Williamsburg, and Brooklyn bridges, were abolished in July 1911 as part of a populist policy initiative headed by New York City mayor William Jay Gaynor. 

In 1970, the federal government enacted the Clean Air Act, a series of federal air pollution regulations. As part of a plan by mayor John Lindsay and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the city government considered implementing tolls on the four East River bridges, including the Manhattan Bridge, in the early 1970s. The plan would have raised money for New York City&#x27;s transit system and allowed the city to meet the Clean Air Act. Abraham Beame, who became mayor in 1974, refused to implement the tolls, and the United States Congress subsequently moved to forbid tolls on the East River bridges. The United States Department of Transportation determined that the eastern upper roadway of the Manhattan Bridge was partially built with federal funds and, under federal law, could not be tolled.

A plan for congestion pricing in New York City was approved in mid-2023, allowing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to toll drivers who enter Manhattan south of 60th Street. Congestion pricing was implemented in January 2025; all Manhattan-bound drivers pay a toll after using the bridge, which varies based on the time of day. Although no toll is charged upon exiting the congestion zone, all Brooklyn-bound drivers must pay a toll to access streets leading to the bridge.

==Impact==
When the Manhattan Bridge was being developed, the &quot;Brooklyn Standard Union&quot; described it as &quot;of greater capacity than either the Williamsburg or Brooklyn bridges, yet lighter and more artistic&quot;. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; predicted that the bridge&#x27;s completion would spur the redevelopment of residential areas in Downtown Brooklyn, and the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; said that warehouses would be developed in Lower Manhattan when the Manhattan Bridge opened. The bridge&#x27;s opening significantly reduced patronage on several ferry lines that had traveled between Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn.

One local civic group predicted that large numbers of Jewish residents would move from Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side to Brooklyn as a result of the bridge&#x27;s opening. These included numerous Jewish families displaced by the bridge&#x27;s construction. In addition, numerous industrial and factory buildings were built around the bridge&#x27;s Brooklyn approach in the 1910s. Some of the land under the bridge&#x27;s approaches was leased out; for example, a Chinese theater was built under the Manhattan approach in the 1940s, and a shopping mall was built there in the 1980s. The area under the Brooklyn approach became known as Dumbo, short for &quot;Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass&quot;, in the late 20th century and became an upscale residential neighborhood by the 2010s.

In the two decades following the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s completion, few bridges with longer spans were constructed. Nonetheless, the use of the deflection theory enabled the construction of longer suspension bridges in the early 20th century. Two of the world&#x27;s largest suspension bridge spans built in the 1930s, the Golden Gate Bridge and the George Washington Bridge, incorporated deflection theory into their designs.

The bridge was the subject of American artist Edward Hopper&#x27;s 1928 painting &quot;Manhattan Bridge Loop&quot;.

<text>Michael Ryan Flatley (born July 16, 1958) is an American former professional performer and choreographer of Irish dance. Flatley is credited with reinventing traditional Irish dance by incorporating new rhythms, syncopation, and upper body movements, which were previously absent from the dance. He created and performed in Irish dance shows &quot;Riverdance&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;, &quot;Feet of Flames&quot;, &quot;Celtic Tiger Live&quot; and &quot;Michael Flatley&#x27;s Christmas Dance Spectacular&quot;. Flatley&#x27;s shows have played to more than 60 million people in 60 countries and have grossed more than $1 billion. He has also been an actor, writer, director, producer, musician, and philanthropist.

Flatley formerly held the Guinness World Record for tap dancing 35 times per second and his feet were at one time insured for $57.6 million. Flatley retired from dance in 2016 due to constant spinal, knee, foot, and rib pain. In January 2023, he was treated for &quot;an aggressive cancer&quot;, which is now in remission.

==Early life==
Michael Ryan Flatley was born on July 16, 1958, the second of five children born to Irish parents Michael James Flatley and Elisabeth &quot;Eilish&quot; Flatley (&quot;née&quot; Ryan), both of whom had emigrated to the United States in 1947. Michael was a plumber from County Sligo, and Eilish was a gifted step dancer from County Carlow whose mother, Hannah Ryan, was a champion dancer. Michael and Eilish met at an Irish dance in Detroit, and were married in that city on August 25, 1956. They eventually had five children: Anne-Marie, Michael, Eliza, Thomasina, and Patrick. When Michael was two months old, the family moved from Detroit to Chicago&#x27;s South Side. 

In Chicago, Flatley began dance lessons at age eleven with Dennis G. Dennehy at the Dennehy School of Irish Dance. He attended Brother Rice High School, an all-boys Catholic private school. In 1975, at age 17, Flatley was the first American to win a World Irish Dance title at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne, the Irish dancing championships. In 1975 and 1976, Flatley won twice in the All-Ireland Fleadh Cheoil concert flute competitions.

In the 1970s, Flatley competed in the amateur boxing Chicago Golden Gloves tournament in the 126 pound novice division and won the middleweight division of the Chicago Golden Gloves Boxing Championship. He recorded five knock-out victories. Flatley stated that he continued to flirt with the idea of becoming a professional into the early 1980s, but ultimately stayed with a career in dance. In this early stage of his career he was described as &quot;the white Michael Jackson&quot; by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, the &quot;Rudolph Nureyev of Irish dance&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot;, and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; compared his feet to &quot;the hands of Vladimir Horowitz in power and agility&quot;. He later became a philanthropic donor to the Golden Gloves organization. In 2023 Flatley was one of four fighters to be named a Titan of Chicago Golden Gloves Boxing during their 100th Anniversary celebrations.

==Career==
===Early career===
After graduating high school, Flatley worked in various fields, including as a stockbroker, a blackjack gambler, and a flautist. From 1978 to 1979, Flatley toured with Green Fields of America. In the 1980s, he toured with The Chieftains, though he was turned down when he requested to become a full-time member of the band.

===&quot;Riverdance&quot;===
After attracting the attention of President of Ireland Mary Robinson and dance-show producers, Flatley was invited to help create an intermission show for the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest. He performed in a 7-minute show titled &quot;Riverdance&quot; for the interval act of the contest, which was held in Ireland. After receiving worldwide acclaim, Flatley pushed to turn the show into a full-length production, which became &quot;Riverdance&quot;. The show was produced by Moya Doherty, with principal choreography and lead performances by Flatley and Jean Butler. It debuted in February of 1995 at the Point Theatre in Dublin.

In September 1995, after the show sold out, Flatley left &quot;Riverdance&quot; to pursue what would eventually become &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;. Flatley had been in a dispute with the &quot;Riverdance&quot; producers over his salary and royalty fees. He was fired the night before the show was set to begin its second run in London and replaced with Colin Dunne. He also reportedly did not work well with Butler, though on the split, Flatley said, &quot;I just wanted control over the work that I had created myself. That&#x27;s all. I don&#x27;t think that that&#x27;s too much to ask. I felt like I built it and they took it, and that&#x27;s the end of it... and it hurt.&quot; Flatley paid approximately £1 million to settle a wrongful termination lawsuit from his former manager, John Reid.

===&quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; and &quot;Feet of Flames&quot;===
After the Riverdance split, Flatley created his own show, &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;, which was capable of playing in arenas and stadiums aside from traditional theaters. It premiered in June 1996 at the Point Theatre (now 3Arena) in Dublin, the same venue where Riverdance premiered, then made its U.K. premiere at the London Coliseum. The music for the show was composed by Ronan Hardiman. In 1997, Flatley earned £36 million, making him the 25th-highest earning entertainer in the world.

In 1998, Flatley created an expanded version of the show called &quot;Feet of Flames&quot; which served as its one-off performance and his final performance in Lord of the Dance. It was performed outdoors in the Rotten Row/Route of Kings area of Hyde Park, London on a 4-tier hydraulic stage, with a live band, and over 100 dancers performing on all four levels of the stage during the finale. Ronan Hardiman&#x27;s music from the original Lord of the Dance was used again, along with new compositions of his. The show had six new numbers, one of which is Flatley&#x27;s solo.

Following the success of the 1998 Hyde Park show, Flatley produced another version of &quot;Feet of Flames&quot; in 1999, which included half of the original show and half new material. Titled &quot;Feet of Flames: The Victory World Tour&quot;, the show was performed also on a multi-level stage and toured Europe in 2000 and the U.S. in 2001.

===&quot;Celtic Tiger&quot;===
Flatley&#x27;s next show, &quot;Celtic Tiger Live&quot;, opened in July 2005. The show explores the history of the Irish people and Irish emigration to the U.S., fusing a wide range of dance styles, including jazz. The show also includes popular elements from his previous shows, such as Flatley&#x27;s flute solos and the line of dancers in the finale.

Flatley wrote &quot;I will be a dancer until the day I die&quot; in the program book of the show.

On November 15, 2006, prior to planned European performances of the show, Flatley was admitted to a London hospital with a viral infection. He was discharged two weeks later, but cancelled the tour.

===Television performances (2007–2009)===

In November 2007, Flatley and a troupe of male dancers performed on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; in the U.S. In October 2008, he appeared as a guest judge on an episode of the show, filling in for Len Goodman. He performed the solo &quot;Capone&quot; from &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot; on the show. Flatley was also the host of &quot;Superstars of Dance&quot;, an NBC series that ran for 5 episodes in early 2009. He also performed on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, during the 1997 Academy Awards ceremony, and was interviewed on Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories in 2011.

===Return to the stage (2009–2010)===
In December 2009, Flatley performed in a limited run of the &quot;Hyde Park&quot; version of &quot;Feet of Flames&quot; in Taiwan. The run of shows had to be extended to meet the demand for tickets.

In 2010, he returned to headline the &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; show, with performances in arenas in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. However, unlike the original show, the stage for the 2010 Return Tour was redesigned; it featured new sets, new costumes, state-of-the-art lighting, newer pyrotechnics, and projections.

&quot;Lord of the Dance 3D&quot;, the 3D film of the return tour, debuted in theaters worldwide in 2011. The 3D film was later released on DVD and Blu-ray under the title, &quot;Michael Flatley Returns as Lord of the Dance&quot;, and shows performances from the O2 Arenas of London, Dublin, and Berlin.

===Flute album (2011)===
In 2011, Flatley released &quot;On A Different Note&quot;, a flute album. The 25 tracks include airs and tunes he has played in his shows, other traditional tunes, and new compositions.

===&quot;A Night to Remember, Dangerous Games&quot;===
On May 18, 2014, Flatley recorded a one-off 60 minute ITV Music Specials episode titled &quot;Michael Flatley: A Night to Remember&quot; celebrating his long career. The show aired on June 1, 2014, and was presented by Christine Bleakley.

Also in the same year, Flatley created a revised spin-off of Lord of the Dance, entitled &quot;Lord of the Dance: Dangerous Games&quot;, which featured a similar storyline with new numbers, as well as new music by Gerard Fahy, who previously served as a bandleader and musical director in Flatley&#x27;s shows.

===Injuries, farewell tour, and retirement===
In May 2015, Flatley revealed that much of his vertebral column was irreparably damaged and that he had a damaged left knee, a torn right calf/triceps surae muscle, two ruptured Achilles tendons, a fractured rib, and a recurring broken bone in his foot. That year, a caricature of him was hung in the Sardi&#x27;s restaurant on Broadway.

In November 2015, Flatley&#x27;s show &quot;Lord of the Dance: Dangerous Games&quot; premiered at the Lyric Theatre, a Broadway theatre. Due to his injuries, Flatley was only able to perform in the final two numbers of the performance. After shows in New York, Flatley went on a final tour in the United States. What was then thought to be Flatley&#x27;s last show was in Las Vegas on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 2016.

===Later work===
In January 2017, Flatley introduced his troupe for a performance at the inauguration of Donald Trump as president, which he called &quot;a great honour&quot;. In 2021, he helped the World Irish Dancing Championships, a competition that he won in 1975, to launch a new competition for freestyle dance. The competition attracted over 2,500 entrants.

==Other ventures==
===Filmmaker===
In 2018, Flatley wrote, directed, financed and starred in &quot;Blackbird&quot;, a spy film set in Barbados, Ireland and the UK. The film co-stars Patrick Bergin and Eric Roberts. &quot;Blackbird&quot; had its world premiere in a private showing at the Raindance Film Festival in London, where Flatley was also a member of the Festival Jury. As of November 2018 pre-production work had already begun on Flatley&#x27;s second film, titled &quot;Dreamdance&quot;, set in Hollywood at the outbreak of World War II. &quot;Blackbird&quot; premiered August 2022 in the Light House Cinema in Dublin. The film was critically panned. It received a one star review from Peter Bradshaw in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, while Flatley received the Best Actor award from the Monaco Streaming Film Festival for his role in the film. When reporting on the award, the &quot;Irish Post&quot; described the plot of the film as &quot;A Casablanca-inspired spy thriller, Blackbird centres on Flatley as a retired intelligence operative who finds his quiet life running a hotel in Barbados thrown into chaos when an old friend turns up and draws him back into the world he left behind.&quot;

===Artist===
Starting in the early 2010s, Flatley has used his choreographer dance moves to create artwork with his feet, by dancing upon paint splattered canvas. A series of paintings he created in the mid-2010s was based upon the Great Irish Famine. As of 2015, Flatley was second only to Jack Butler Yeats in terms of the auction price of paintings by Irish painters.
===Food and beverage industry===
Around this time he also founded the food and beverage company Castlehyde, named for his residential estate. His net worth was reportedly €301 million in 2019.

==Awards and achievements==
In 1988, Flatley received a National Heritage Fellowship, the highest folk-related honor awarded by the US National Endowment for the Arts.

In December 2001, Flatley became the first recipient of the Irish Dancing Commission Fellowship award (an honorary degree in Irish dance), and was also made a Fellow of the American Irish Dance Teachers&#x27; Association. In 2003 Flatley received a special award from Prince Rainier of Monaco for his charity work, and in March 2003 &quot;Irish America&quot; magazine named Flatley Irish American of the Year. In 2004, Flatley received an honorary doctorate degree from University College Dublin, and that same year received the prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor in New York. In 2016 he received an honorary degree from the University of Limerick.

In 2007, the &quot;Freedom of the City of Cork&quot; was conferred on Flatley at a ceremony in Cork&#x27;s City Hall. In 2008, he was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Sligo at a ceremony in Sligo City Hall. Also in 2008, The Variety Club of Ireland presented Flatley with the Entertainer of the Decade Award.

In 2011, he was inducted into &quot;Irish America&quot; magazine&#x27;s Irish America Hall of Fame.

On October 24, 2013, Flatley received the Lifetime Achievement Award at &quot;The Irish Post&quot; Awards on Park Lane. In 2015, a section of 42nd Street and Broadway in New York City was named &quot;Flatley Way&quot; for the artist. The honour corresponded with his opening of his show Lord of the Dance: Dangerous Games at the nearby Lyric Theatre. He received the Freedom of the City of London honour from London, UK, which names a number of specific actions those who receive the honor can take that others cannot—such as the ability to &quot;drive a herd of sheep over London Bridge&quot;. In 2024, Prince Albert of Monaco presented Flatley with the CC Forum award for outstanding contribution to global humanitarian causes. 

==Personal life==
===Relationships and family===
Flatley met Beata Dziaba in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. The couple married in 1986 in a Danish registry office; they divorced in 1997 after his multiple affairs with other women. In the early 2000s, Flatley was engaged to Lisa Murphy; she died in 2024, aged 51.

In June 2006, Flatley began dating Niamh O&#x27;Brien, a longtime dancer from several of his shows. As the Catholic Church does not recognize divorce and does not marry divorcees, his first marriage in a civil wedding was not recognized in Canon Law by the Church, so the 48-year-old Flatley and Niamh, 32, were able to have a Roman Catholic ceremony; on October 14, 2006 they married at St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Fermoy, County Cork, with a reception at Flatley&#x27;s historic Castlehyde House in Cork.

He and his wife have a son, Michael St. James, born in 2007.

===Health===
In 2003, Flatley was treated for a malignant melanoma, after a viewer of MTV pointed out a brown spot on the side of Flatley&#x27;s face which Flatley himself had not noticed. In January 2023, he was treated for &quot;an aggressive cancer&quot;, which is now in remission.

===Properties===
In 1997, Flatley purchased Park Villas Place in London after a bidding war against Madonna; he sold the home in 2024.

In 2001, Flatley purchased Castlehyde House, originally owned by Douglas Hyde, the first president of Ireland, near Fermoy in north-east Cork, then in a derelict condition, for €3 million. Flatley spent €27 million renovating the mansion and another €20 million furnishing it with artwork and antiques. He listed Castlehyde for sale for €20 million but pulled it from the market after deciding he cannot part with the property.

In 2015, Flatley purchased a mansion in Belgravia, just off Eaton Square, for €28 million. 

In addition to Castlehyde and his London mansion, Flatley owns properties in the Caribbean, New York, Beverly Hills, France, Italy and Villefranche-sur-Mer.

His primary residence is in Monaco.

===Other===
Flatley has invested a significant portion of his wealth in Berkshire Hathaway.

In 2003, courts ruled that Flatley was extorted and defamed by real estate agent Tyna Marie Robertson, who falsely accused Flatley of sexual assault. Robertson was ordered to pay $11 million compensation.

In 2006, Flatley released &quot;Lord of the Dance: My Story&quot;, his autobiography. 

In 2010, Flatley dedicated the Garden of Memory and Music in Culfadda, County Sligo, the village his father left to seek a new life in America. The ceremony included a speech and an impromptu performance of one of his father&#x27;s favorite tunes.

===Arms===
==Fundraising==
Flatley has raised over €1 million for his charitable foundation by selling paintings made using his feet. He has hosted annual Christmas fundraisers for vulnerable children at his estate. In 2010, Flatley participated in the fundraising JP McManus Pro-Am in Adare, County Limerick, Ireland. In 2020 he created the &quot;Flatley&#x27;sTapForTen challenge&quot; in order to raise money for people found homeless due to the COVID-19 pandemic, benefiting the charities Depaul in Ireland and Centrepoint in the UK. He is also a supporter of the Irish Fund for Great Britain that provides social support for Irish citizens living in the UK. 
He has also spent time as an advocate for cancer research. In 2021, Flatley was named an Ambassador of Culture for Co Saolfada, a cancer research advocacy program. Flatley himself was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2003 and has since recovered. Flatley has also advocated an anti-war sentiment - in 2003 he performed the anti-war piece &quot;Warlord&quot; before an audience of national leaders meeting in St. Petersburg. In 2022 he spoke out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine and noted that performances of &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot; would raise money for related humanitarian relief efforts.

<text>Contempt of Congress is the misdemeanor act of obstructing the work of the United States Congress or one of its committees. Historically, the bribery of a U.S. senator or U.S. representative was considered contempt of Congress. In modern times, contempt of Congress has generally applied to the refusal to comply with a subpoena issued by a congressional committee or subcommittee—usually seeking to compel either testimony or the production of requested documents.

== History ==
In the late 1790s, declaring contempt of Congress was considered an &quot;implied power&quot; of the legislature, in a similar manner as the British Parliament could make findings of contempt of Parliament—early Congresses issued contempt citations against numerous individuals for a variety of actions. Some instances of contempt of Congress included citations against: 
* Robert Randal, for an attempt to bribe Representative William Smith of South Carolina in 1795.
* William Duane, a newspaper editor who refused to answer Senate questions in 1800.
* Nathaniel Rounsavell, another newspaper editor, for releasing sensitive information to the press in 1812.

In &quot;Anderson v. Dunn&quot; (1821), the Supreme Court of the United States held that Congress&#x27;s power to hold someone in contempt was essential to ensure that Congress was &quot;... not exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness, caprice, or even conspiracy, may mediate against it.&quot;
The historical interpretation that bribery of a senator or representative was considered contempt of Congress has long since been abandoned in favor of criminal statutes. In 1857, Congress enacted a law that made &quot;contempt of Congress&quot; a criminal offense against the United States.

In the Air Mail Scandal of 1934, William MacCracken, former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Aeronautics, was sentenced to ten days of detention for destroying evidence under subpoena. MacCracken appealed his sentence to the Supreme Court in &quot;Jurney v. MacCracken&quot;. After losing his case, he surrendered to Chesley Jurney, Senate sergeant at arms, who detained him in a room at the Willard Hotel.

While it has been said that &quot;Congress is handcuffed in getting obstinate witnesses to comply&quot;, cases have been referred to the United States Department of Justice. The Office of Legal Counsel has asserted that the President of the United States is protected from contempt by executive privilege.

In March 2024, it was reported that Peter Navarro would be the first former White House official to be imprisoned for a contempt of Congress criminal conviction. Steve Bannon would then follow in July 2024. Both Navarro and Bannon&#x27;s contempt of Congress convictions and prison sentences were connected with their refusals to comply with subpoenas which required them testify before the now-defunct House Select Committee that investigated January 6, 2021.

== Subpoenas ==
The Supreme Court affirmed in &quot;Watkins v. United States&quot; (1957) that &quot;[the] power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process&quot; and that &quot;[it] is unquestionably the duty of all citizens to cooperate with the Congress in its efforts to obtain the facts needed for intelligent legislative action. It is their unremitting obligation to respond to subpoenas, to respect the dignity of the Congress and its committees and to testify fully with respect to matters within the province of proper investigation.&quot; Congressional rules empower all its standing committees with the authority to compel witnesses to produce testimony and documents for subjects under its jurisdiction. Committee rules may provide for the full committee to issue a subpoena, or permit subcommittees or the chairman (acting alone or with the ranking member) to issue subpoenas.

As announced in &quot;Wilkinson v. United States&quot; (1961), a congressional committee must meet three requirements for its subpoenas to be &quot;legally sufficient.&quot; First, the committee&#x27;s investigation of the broad subject area must be authorized by its chamber; second, the investigation must pursue &quot;a valid legislative purpose&quot; but does not need to involve legislation and does not need to specify the ultimate intent of Congress; and third, the specific inquiries must be pertinent to the subject matter area that has been authorized for investigation.

The Court held in &quot;Eastland v. United States Servicemen&#x27;s Fund&quot; (1975) that congressional subpoenas are within the scope of the Speech or Debate clause which provides &quot;an absolute bar to judicial interference&quot; once it is determined that Members are acting within the &quot;legitimate legislative sphere&quot; with such compulsory process. Under that ruling, courts generally do not hear motions to quash congressional subpoenas; even when executive branch officials refuse to comply, courts tend to rule that such matters are &quot;political questions&quot; unsuitable for judicial remedy. In fact, many legal rights usually associated with a judicial subpoena do not apply to a congressional subpoena. For example, attorney–client privilege and information that is normally protected under the Trade Secrets Act do not need to be recognized.

== Procedures ==
Following the refusal of a witness to produce documents or to testify, the committee is entitled to report a resolution of contempt to its parent chamber. A committee may also cite a person for contempt but not immediately report the resolution to the floor. In the case of subcommittees, they report the resolution of contempt to the full committee, which then has the option of rejecting it, accepting it but not reporting it to the floor, or accepting it and reporting it to the floor of the chamber for action. On the floor of the House or the Senate, the reported resolution is considered privileged and, if the resolution of contempt is passed, the chamber has several options to enforce its mandate.

=== Inherent contempt ===
Under this process, the procedure for holding a person in contempt involves only the chamber concerned. Following a contempt citation, the person cited is arrested by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House or Senate, brought to the floor of the chamber, held to answer charges by the presiding officer, and then subjected to punishment as the chamber may dictate (usually imprisonment for punishment, imprisonment for coercion, or release from the contempt citation).

Concerned with the time-consuming nature of a contempt proceeding and the inability to extend punishment further than the session of the Congress concerned (under Supreme Court rulings), Congress created a statutory process in 1857. While Congress retains its &quot;inherent contempt&quot; authority and may exercise it at any time, this inherent contempt process was last used by the Senate in 1934, in a Senate investigation of airlines and the U.S. Postmaster. After a one-week trial on the Senate floor (presided over by Vice President John Nance Garner, in his capacity as President of the Senate), William P. MacCracken Jr., a lawyer and former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Aeronautics who was charged with allowing clients to remove or rip up subpoenaed documents, was found guilty and sentenced to 10 days imprisonment.

MacCracken filed a petition of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in federal courts to overturn his arrest, but after litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Congress had acted constitutionally, and denied the petition in the case &quot;Jurney v. MacCracken&quot;.

The last attempt by the House of Representatives to use this inherent contempt process was on July 11, 2024, when they voted on a resolution that could have held Attorney General Merrick Garland in inherent contempt of Congress. The resolution would have imposed a fine of $10,000 per day on Garland for defying a congressional subpoena until he handed over audio of former special counsel Robert Hur’s interview with President Joe Biden. This attempt fell short in a 204 to 210 vote by the House of Representatives and Garland was not found in inherent contempt, with four Republicans voting with all Democrats to oppose the measure.

=== Statutory proceedings ===

Following a contempt citation, the presiding officer of the chamber is instructed to refer the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia; according to the law it is the duty of the U.S. Attorney to refer the matter to a grand jury for action.

The criminal offense of contempt of Congress is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $100,000 nor less than $100 and imprisonment in a common jail for not less than one month nor more than twelve months.

=== Civil procedures ===
Senate Rules authorize the Senate to direct the Senate Legal Counsel to file a civil action against any private individual found in contempt. Upon motion by the Senate, the federal district court issues another order for a person to comply with Senate process. If the subject then refuses to comply with the Court&#x27;s order, the person may be cited for contempt of court and may incur sanctions imposed by the Court. The process has been used at least six times.

<text>The Church of St Mary-le-Bow () is a Church of England parish church in the City of London, England. Located on Cheapside, one of the city&#x27;s oldest thoroughfares, the church was founded in 1080, by Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury. Rebuilt several times over the ensuing centuries, the present church is the work of Sir Christopher Wren, following the Great Fire of London (1666). With its tall spire, it is still a landmark in the City of London, being the third highest of any Wren church, surpassed only by nearby St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and St Bride&#x27;s, Fleet Street. At a cost of over £15,000, it was also his second most expensive, again only surpassed by St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

St Mary-le-Bow is widely known for its bells, which also feature in the nursery rhyme &#x27;Oranges and Lemons&#x27;. According to legend, Dick Whittington heard the bells calling him back to the city in 1392, leading him to become Lord Mayor. Traditionally, anyone born within earshot of the bells was considered to be a true Londoner, or Cockney.

The church suffered severe damage by the Luftwaffe in the Second World War as part of the Blitz, like many churches in London. The interior was reduced to a shell and though the tower survived, fire damage made the bells crash to the floor. The church was sympathetically restored to its pre-war condition by Laurence King from 1956 to 1964. The church was awarded Grade I listed status, the highest possible rating, on the National Heritage List for England, whilst still a shell in 1950.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
Though archaeological excavations suggest an earlier Saxon building may have stood on the site prior to the Norman Conquest, the first confirmed church dedicated to St Mary on Cheapside was built by Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1080. Lanfranc, who was William the Conqueror&#x27;s archbishop brought over from Normandy, founded the church as part of the Norman policy of dominating London. Three major buildings were constructed as part of this policy; St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, the Tower of London, and a church on Cheapside.

The church at Cheapside was dedicated to St Mary and was constructed from Caen stone from Normandy, the same stone used in the Tower of London. The architect for the Tower of London was Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, who may have also designed the first St Mary-le-Bow. This early church was built on two levels, with a lower undercroft partially below street level and the upper church, built above it. The lower church was constructed first and featured round stone arches, which were a novelty at the time. This led to the church being known as &quot;Sancta Maria de Arcubus&quot; (St Mary of the Arches), a name which eventually became St Mary-le-Bow, &quot;bow&quot; being an old name for arches.

=== 11th and 12th centuries ===
The church was nearing completion in 1091 when it was destroyed by a violent tornado, amongst the most powerful ever to strike England. Roof rafters measuring long were thrown up in the air and forced into the ground with such force that only their tips remained visible. The lower church survived, but the upper church was damaged beyond repair. The church was rebuilt, possibly in facsimile, but was destroyed again just a hundred years later, in a fire in 1196. The fire was caused by fugitive William Fitz Osbert hiding in the church tower, and to coax him out, supporters of the Archbishop of Canterbury set fire to the church. Osbert was fatally stabbed as he fled.

=== Late medieval period ===

The church was rebuilt again in the early 13th century following the 1196 fire, becoming a peculiar of the Archbishops of Canterbury and their London headquarters. It became home to the Court of Arches, to which the church gave its name. The Court of Arches, which still has its home at St Mary-le-Bow today, was the ecclesiastical court of appeal for the Province of Canterbury, founded in 1251. This allegiance to Canterbury made it the second most important church in London, after St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

The tower partially collapsed in its south west corner in 1271, killing at least one civilian in Cheapside below, Laurence Ducket. The tower was not immediately repaired and was kept in use. From 1363 onwards, the tower&#x27;s principal use was the housing of the city&#x27;s curfew bell, rung at 9 pm every evening and being able to be heard as far away as Hackney Marshes.

Work to repair the tower was slow, with construction noted to take place in 1448, 1459 and 1479. The tower was finally completed in 1512, supporting a spectacular series of stone lanterns; four around the corners of the tower and one suspended in the centre by arches. These lanterns were designed to light the streets below.

==== Destruction during the Great Fire of London (1666) ====
Soon after midnight on Sunday, 2 September 1666, a fire started in Thomas Farriner&#x27;s bakery on Pudding Lane, to the southeast of St. Mary-le-Bow. During the course of the night, the easterly wind spread the fire through the city, consuming 300 houses in the first night alone. The fire continued to grow, becoming a firestorm on Monday and sweeping west towards St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

St Mary-le-Bow was one of over fifty churches to catch fire during the firestorm, which was only extinguished on the Thursday. The church was nearly completely destroyed, except for the tower, which survived albeit with fire damage. Attempts were made to repair the tower, but they all ultimately failed: the tower was structurally compromised from the fire and was no longer strong enough to support the ringing of bells.

=== Wren rebuilding ===
Following Christopher Wren&#x27;s appointment as the King&#x27;s Surveyor of Works in 1669, Wren&#x27;s office was contracted to rebuild the fifty one churches of the city consumed by the fire. The Rebuilding of London Act 1670 provided the funds for this, as it included raising the tax on coal. Other than St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, St Mary-le-Bow was considered the most important church in the city, and thus, according to a document dated to 13 June 1670, at the head of the list to be rebuilt. The mason&#x27;s contract for the rebuilding of St Mary-le-Bow was signed just under two months later, on 2 August.

Wren&#x27;s initial designs were for a simple three bay structure and short tower, the latter topped by a simple cupola. This was revised in the same year with a much taller tower and more intricate spire. The body of the church, inspired by the Basilica of Maxentius in Rome, was completed by 1673. The tower, however, would take a further seven years to finish, being finally completed in 1680. The total cost of the rebuilding was £15,421 (equivalent to more than £2.3 million in 2021), the second most expensive of any of Wren&#x27;s churches, only surpassed by St Paul&#x27;s. The tower was rebuilt in Portland stone, the rest of the church in brick. The tower became such a landmark that it was known as the &quot;Cheapside pillar&quot;.

During the rebuilding, Wren moved the position of the tower to sit directly on Cheapside, whereas the Norman and Tudor towers had sat back from the road. Whilst building the foundations for the tower, Wren came across an old Roman causeway below ground level and deep, which provided a solid foundation. Wren also discovered the 11th century undercroft below the ruins, but he was uninterested, believing it to be Roman. He only provided a trapdoor and ladder into the undercroft, which became the crypt for the church above it.

=== 18th – 20th centuries ===
In 1820, the upper part of the spire was rebuilt and repaired by architect George Gwilt. In 1850, the church finally ceased to be a &#x27;peculiar&#x27;, coming under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of London, ending a practice started six hundred years earlier. The church continued, however, to be the home of the Court of Arches. Further alterations took place in the late 19th century, with the removal of galleries in 1867 and additional modifications from 1878-1879.

In 1914, a stone from the crypt of the church was placed in Trinity Church, New York, to mark the fact that William III granted the vestry of Trinity Church the same privileges as St Mary-le-Bow vestry.

==== Second World War ====
Beginning in 1940, the Luftwaffe began bombarding British cities from the air, a campaign known as the Blitz; London was struck especially heavily. Throughout most of the campaign, St Mary-le-Bow suffered only minor damage. However, on the final night of the Blitz, 10–11 May 1941, the church took several direct hits. A major fire started, destroying most of the building except the outer walls and the tower. The tower was not directly hit, but the fires from the church interior spread, burning out the tower floors and causing its bells to crash to the floor. The use of Portland stone in the tower, rather than the brick used in the body of the church, contributed to its survival.

From 1956 to 1964, the church was sympathetically rebuilt and restored by Laurence King to Wren&#x27;s designs, at a cost of £63,000. The tower survived, mostly as Wren left it, but part of it required rebuilding due to fire damage weakening the walls. The church was reconsecrated in 1964, achieving Grade I listed status whilst still a ruin in 1950.

== Architecture ==

=== Plan ===

The church building has a rectangular plan, with the tower situated on the northwest corner, separated from the main body of the church by a vestibule. The design of the church is such that the chancel occupies the eastern end of the nave, both with north and south aisles, which are noted to be extremely narrow. A vestry adjoins the vestibule to the north of the north aisle.

Unusually, due to the addition of the vestibule separating the tower and nave, the building has a greater length north to south than east to west; measuring from east to west but from the north wall of the tower to the south wall of the nave. The total area of the church building is , which according to the Church of England, makes it a &quot;large&quot; sized church building.

=== Exterior ===
The exterior of St Mary-le-Bow is mostly constructed from red brick with dressings of Portland stone, with the exception of the tower, which is built entirely from Portland stone. The three principal facades of the building (south, north and east) have gabled walls and pedimented centres, complete with triplets of round-headed windows. The most prominent aspect of the exterior is Wren&#x27;s imposing tower, measuring square externally and with a height of 221 feet 9 inches (67.6 m), it is the third highest of any Wren church.

The tower, constructed of Portland stone, is formed of four stages surmounted by an elaborate stone spire. The lowest stage has doorways in the north and west faces of the tower, set in substantial stone recess with added rustication. The recess has a round head and is flanked by Doric order columns, which support a moulded entablature above. The doorways inside these recesses are set between Tuscan order columns which support a Doric frieze. The second and third stages of the tower are more simple in construction, with two large square windows to the second stage, and a single round-headed window to the third. The fourth stage, housing the bell chamber, has a large round-headed opening in each wall, divided into three sections by thin mullions and filled with louvre boards. Framing the bell openings are pairs of Ionic order pilasters supporting an entablature, above which is the parapet. The parapet comprises an open balustrade between four corner pinnacles, formed of four ogee scrolls topped with small stone vases.

The spire above the tower is also formed of four stages. The lowest stage is a circular drum-shaped structure surrounded by twelve columns which have carved acanthus capitals. These twelve columns support a cornice with modillion decoration. Above the cornice is a second open balustrade, similar in design to that on the top of the tower. The second stage is formed of twelve curved flying buttresses which support a circular-shaped moulded cornice. The third stage stands on the base of the cornice, and is square in plan, with granite columns on the corners. These columns support the fourth and final stage of the spire, which takes the form of a tall, square, tapering pinnacle, surmounted by a ball and weathervane, the latter taking the shape of a winged dragon. 

=== Interior ===
Only three bays make up the nave of the church, which is divided into small aisles by large round-headed arches. These arches are supported by compound piers with attached demi-columns that feature shorter pilasters for the openings and Corinthian capitals for the nave and aisles. The tunnel vault above the nave is covered in ornamental panelling that is painted blue and white and is penetrated by the clerestory windows.

The church windows are among the structure&#x27;s most prominent elements following its 1964 restoration. They, along with the other furniture, vestments, etc., were created by John Hayward. All three of the east windows have rounded arches, although the central window is taller and wider than its neighbours, who have small round windows above them.

Linking the church and tower is a vestibule, featuring a tall groin-vaulted stone ceiling. The top of the vault is pierced by a removable circular trapdoor, opened to allow the bells to be lowered or raised from the tower.

Beneath the church, built on almost the same floorplan, is the 11th-century crypt. The crypt, originally built as the undercroft for the church destroyed in the tornado in 1091, is three bays in length and features Norman-era round arches, some of which contain Roman bricks, and a groined vault. The crypt is now in use as the &quot;Café Below&quot;. 

== Music ==

=== Organ ===

The earliest record of an organ at the church dates to 1802 when Hugh Russell of London built a small instrument formed of 13 stops and 2 manuals. This organ, like its successors, was situated on a gallery above the west doors. This organ lasted until 1867, when George Maydwell Holdich, also of London, rebuilt and enlarged the organ. He added a third manual, a pedalboard and 11 additional stops to make a total of 24.

In 1880, the organ was purchased by Walker &amp; Sons at a cost of £255 and transferred to the Methodist Church at Thornton, Leicestershire. Walker &amp; Sons constructed a new instrument for St Mary-le-Bow in the same year, at a cost of £1,108. This new instrument was much larger, formed of 33 stops and 3 manuals plus a pedalboard and was situated in the sanctuary at the eastern end of the church. This organ lasted unaltered until the Blitz, when following the first strike to hit the church, which only caused minor damage, it was removed for safekeeping by Rushworth and Draper.

Following the restoration of the church from 1956, the organ was remodelled in 1964. The organ was reduced in size by almost half, only 18 of the original 33 stops were reinstated and a new case designed and installed above the west door. This organ was considered by many to be a rather poor imitation of its pre-war condition but funds did not permit its replacement for 40 years.

In 2004, a project to replace the organ was launched by the church, with Kenneth Ticknell &amp; Co chosen as builders. The project, which cost £380,000, was funded by corporate and personal donors. In January 2010, the old organ was removed, though the 1964 case, based on work by the Alsace Silbermann family, was kept. The organ was completed in August 2010 and the first recital was given by Thomas Trotter on 29 September. The new organ, which reuses the old case, has 34 stops and two manuals plus pedalboard.

The church also has a small chamber organ, formed of 1 manual and with 5 stops, made by an unknown builder. It is situated in the south nave aisle.

=== Bells ===

==== History ====

===== Early bells =====
The bells at St Mary-le-Bow are often considered to be the most famous peal in the world. According to legend, Richard (Dick) Whittington heard the bells in 1392 when he left the city, calling him back and leading him to become Lord Mayor. The earliest written record of bells at the church is in 1469, when the Common Council orders a curfew bell should be rung at St Mary-le-Bow at 9.00 each evening. In 1515, William Copland, one of Henry VIII&#x27;s merchants, gave money for a &quot;great bell&quot; to be installed, with directions it should be rung to announce the curfew. With Copland&#x27;s gift, the tower then contained five bells.

In the 1552 survey of church goods ordered by Edward VI, the tower is recorded as containing five bells with two additional &quot;sanctus&quot; bells. These five bells would later be augmented, when in 1635, six are recorded. In 1666, during the Great Fire of London, the bells and tower, along with the church, were damaged beyond repair.

Following the Great Fire and Wren&#x27;s rebuilding of the church, the tenor bell of a proposed ring of eight was cast by Christopher Hodson of St Mary Cray in 1669, placed in a temporary structure in the churchyard until the tower was completed. The bell weighed approximately 52 long cwt (2,600 kg). In 1677, Hodson cast the remaining seven and hung all eight bells in the newly completed tower in a new oak frame.

===== 18th and 19th centuries =====
No further work would take place to the bells until 1738 when the tenor bell was recast by Richard Phelps and Thomas Lester; Phelps had previously cast the hour bell at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, called Great Tom, which still survives today. In 1762, Lester &amp; Pack recast and rehung the other seven bells and added two more, to make a ring of ten, keeping the Hodson frame. The bells were rehung again in 1835 by Thomas Mears of Whitechapel and then a third time by Mears &amp; Stainbank in 1863.

In 1881, Mears &amp; Stainbank cast two new bells to augment the ring to twelve, rehanging the 3rd and 4th bells concurrently. This gave London its 5th ring of twelve, following St Bride&#x27;s, Fleet Street; St Michael Cornhill; St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral; and St Giles Cripplegate. In 1902, the bells needed rehanging again, with work taking place to the heaviest three bells by Gillett &amp; Johnston of Croydon. This was evidently not successful, for the bells needed rehanging just 5 years later, the work given to Mears &amp; Stainbank of Whitechapel again.

===== Selfridge&#x27;s ring =====

In January 1927, following the deterioration of the fittings and the condition of the tower, the bells were declared unringable in a report first published by &quot;The Times&quot;. Over the ensuing six years, much work was done to the tower and the church to restore it, but the bells remained unringable, to much public outcry. Finally, in 1933, Harry Gordon Selfridge offered to defray the cost of restoring the bells, an offer which was accepted by the church, who gave the contract to Gillett &amp; Johnston, who Selfridge had worked with a few years previously on bells for his Oxford Street store.

The announcement that Gillett &amp; Johnston intended to recast the tenor, which was believed to be cracked, caused so many objections that a meeting of the Province of Canterbury&#x27;s ecclesiastical court was called; the decision of the court was eventually that the tenor should be recast. Gillett &amp; Johnston found upon removing the bells to their works in Croydon that four more of the bells (6, 7, 8 and 10) were cracked, in addition to the tenor. All five cracked bells were recast in addition to the three lightest bells, leaving only the 4th, 5th, 9th and 11th from the previous ring to be retained; these four bells were retuned. The bells were rehung in their original frame with new cast iron headstocks, ball bearings and wrought iron clappers. The frame was substantially strengthened with a massive concrete and steel grillage weighing 3.5 long tonnes (3,556 kg). The bells were rededicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 7 July 1933.

Shortly after their installation, the BBC World Service recorded the bells for use as a time signal, which brought the attention of the bells to a global audience; the recording survives today. On the night of 10 May 1941, the church was struck by several incendiary bombs. Though the tower was spared a direct hit, the flames from the body of the church were fanned into the tower, which acted like a furnace, destroying all of the internal floors and the frame, causing the bells to crash over to the ground, irrevocably damaging them.

===== Post-war restoration =====

The damaged bells were removed shortly after their destruction to Mears &amp; Stainbank&#x27;s foundry in Whitechapel, but they remained in storage for more than 10 years. In 1956, as the restoration of the church began, attention turned to the restoration of the tower and the recasting of the bells. Much of the cost of restoring the tower and bells was met by the Bernard Sunley Charitable Foundation and Trinity Church, Wall Street, New York City. A new ring of twelve was cast by Mears &amp; Stainbank in 1956, partially reusing metal salvaged from the 1933 ring. However, due to the condition of the tower, which required repairs, the bells were not hung until late 1961.

The bells were dedicated in the presence of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh by Robert Stopford, Bishop of London, on 21 December 1961. The tenor was tolled by Prince Philip at the beginning of the service. The bells were hung in a new frame, made of Javanese Jang (&quot;Dipterocarpus terminatus&quot;). Since then, the bells have been frequently rung, both by members of the Ancient Society of College Youths who reside in or near the city, and by visiting bands of ringers, who come from across the world to ring the bells.

All the bells are named and each bell has an inscription from Psalms, the first letter of each forming the acrostic &#x27;D. Whittington&#x27;. The largest bell weighs 41 long cwt 3 qrs 21 lb (4,697 lb or 2,131 kg), the third heaviest tenor bell in London after St Paul&#x27;s and Southwark Cathedral.

==== Specification ====
==== In popular culture ====
The bells, often considered amongst the most famous in the world, have typically been used to define whether or not one is a true Londoner or Cockney; anyone born within their earshot is considered such. With the urbanisation of the City of London in the 20th and 21st centuries, the increasing population, noise pollution and the soundproofing measures installed in the belfry, the range of the Bow bells is significantly smaller than at its peak.

In 1851, the bells could be heard across north and east London, as far as Hackney Marshes, Stratford and Limehouse, with reports that they could also be heard south of the Thames in Southwark. An acoustic study taken in 2012 shows that this range has shrunk substantially, and is now confined to the eastern parts of the Square Mile and Shoreditch. With no maternity hospitals within this range and only limited residential properties, arguably the modern chance of the birth of a &#x27;true&#x27; cockney is now very low.

The bells are also mentioned in the nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;: &quot;I do not know, says the Great Bell of Bow&quot;.

Ordinarily, distances by road from London are now measured from Charing Cross but, before the late 18th century, they were measured from the London Stone in Cannon Street, or the Standard in Cornhill. However, on the road from London to Lewes, the mileage is taken from the church door of St Mary-le-Bow. To note the reference point used, mileposts along the way are marked with the rebus in cast-iron of a bow and four bells.

The church is also mentioned in the song &quot;The London Boys&quot; by David Bowie (&quot;… Bow Bell strikes another night…&quot;).

The West Ham United F.C. away shirt for the 2024/25 season features a graphic representation of the St Mary-le-Bow woven into the fabric along with a reference to the church&#x27;s bells on the back of the neck.

== Services ==
St Mary-le-Bow ministers to the financial industry and livery companies of the City of London. Consequently, services are held on weekdays rather than the more traditional Sunday morning. Services generally consist of two sessions of 15 minute prayer, one at 8.30 am and another at 5.45 pm on every weekday. These are supplemented by two more formal services of Eucharist, one on a Wednesday lunchtime at 1.05 pm and the second on a Thursday evening at 6.05pm.

<text>Walter Savage Landor (30 January 177517 September 1864) was an English writer, poet, and activist. His best known works were the prose &quot;Imaginary Conversations,&quot; and the poem &quot;Rose Aylmer,&quot; but the critical acclaim he received from contemporary poets and reviewers was not matched by public popularity. As remarkable as his work was, it was equalled by his rumbustious character and lively temperament. Both his writing and political activism, such as his support for Lajos Kossuth and Giuseppe Garibaldi, were imbued with his passion for liberal and republican causes. He befriended and influenced the next generation of literary reformers such as Charles Dickens and Robert Browning.

==Summary of his work==

In a long and active life of 89 years Landor produced a considerable amount of work in various genres. This can perhaps be classified into four main areas—prose, lyric poetry, political writings including epigrams, and Latin. His prose and poetry have received most acclaim, but critics are divided in their preference between them and he is now often described as &#x27;a poet&#x27;s poet&#x27; and author of perhaps the greatest very short poems in English, &#x27;Some of the best poets, Yeats, Ezra Pound and Robert Frost among them, steered by his lights&#x27;. Landor&#x27;s prose is best represented by the &quot;Imaginary Conversations&quot;. He drew on a vast array of historical characters from Greek philosophers to contemporary writers and composed conversations between pairs of characters that covered areas of philosophy, politics, romance and many other topics. These exercises proved a more successful application of Landor&#x27;s natural ability for writing dialogue than his plays. Although these have many quotable passages the overall effect suffered because he never learned the art of drama.

Landor wrote much sensitive and beautiful poetry. The love poems were inspired by a succession of female romantic ideals – Ione, Ianthe, Rose Aylmer and Rose Paynter. Equally sensitive are his &quot;domestic&quot; poems about his sister and his children.

In the course of his career Landor wrote for various journals on a range of topics that interested him from anti-Pitt politics to the unification of Italy. He was also a master of the epigram which he used to good effect and wrote satirically to avenge himself on politicians and other people who upset him.

Landor wrote over 300 Latin poems, political tracts and essays, but these have generally been ignored in the collections of his work. Landor found Latin useful for expressing things that might otherwise have been &quot;indecent or unattractive&quot; as he put it and as a cover for libellous material. Fellow classical scholars of the time put Landor&#x27;s Latin work on a par with his English writing.

==Summary of his life==
Landor&#x27;s biography consists of a catalogue of incidents and misfortunes, many of them self-inflicted but some no fault of his own. His headstrong nature and hot-headed temperament, combined with a complete contempt for authority, landed him in a great deal of trouble over the years. By a succession of bizarre actions, he was successively thrown out of Rugby school, of Oxford and from time to time from the family home. In the course of his life he came into conflict deliberately with his political enemies – the supporters of Pitt – but inadvertently with a succession of Lord Lieutenants, Bishops, Lord Chancellors, Spanish officers, Italian Grand Dukes, nuncio legatos, lawyers and other minor officials. He usually gained the upper hand, if not with an immediate hilarious response, then possibly many years later with a biting epithet.

Landor&#x27;s writing often landed him on the wrong side of the laws of libel, and even his refuge in Latin proved of no avail in Italy. Many times his friends had to come to his aid in smoothing the ruffled feathers of his opponents or in encouraging him to moderate his behaviour. His friends were equally active in the desperate attempts to get his work published, where he offended or felt cheated by a succession of publishers who found his work either unsellable or unpublishable. He was repeatedly involved in legal disputes with his neighbours whether in England or Italy and Dickens&#x27; characterisation of him in &quot;Bleak House&quot; revolves around such a dispute over a gate between Boythorn and Sir Leicester Dedlock. Fate dealt with him unfairly when he tried to put into practice his bold and generous ideas to improve the lot of man, or when he was mistaken at one time for an agent of the Prince of Wales and at another for a tramp. His stormy marriage with his long-suffering wife resulted in a long separation, and then when she had finally taken him back in a series of sad attempts to escape.

And yet Landor was described by Swinburne as &quot;the kindest and gentlest of men&quot;. He collected a coterie of friends who went to great lengths to help him, and writing for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Swinburne comments that &quot;his loyalty and liberality of heart were as inexhaustible as his bounty and beneficence of hand&quot;, adding that &quot;praise and encouragement, deserved or undeserved, came more readily to his lips than challenge or defiance&quot;. The numerous accounts of those with whom he came in contact reveal that he was fascinating company and he dined out on his wit and knowledge for a great part of his life. Landor&#x27;s powerful sense of humour, expressed in his tremendous and famous laughs no doubt contributed to and yet helped assuage the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. &quot;His passionate compassion, his bitter and burning pity for all wrongs endured in all the world, found outlet in his lifelong defence of tyrannicide. His tender and ardent love of children, of animals and of flowers makes fragrant alike the pages of his writing and the records of his life&quot;.

==Early life==
Walter Savage Landor was born in Warwick, England, the eldest son of Dr Walter Landor (1733–1805), a physician, and his second wife, Elizabeth (1743–1829), one of four daughters and heiresses of Charles Savage, of Tachbrook, Warwickshire. His birthplace, Eastgate House, became occupied by The King&#x27;s High School For Girls. His father inherited estates at Rugeley, Staffordshire and his mother was heiress to estates at Ipsley Court and Bishop&#x27;s Tachbrook in Warwickshire. Landor as the eldest son was heir to these properties and looked forward to a life of prosperity. The family tradition was Whig in reaction to George III and Pitt, and although Landor&#x27;s brother Robert was the only other member to achieve fame as a writer there was a strong literary tradition in the family.

After attending a school at Knowle, he was sent to Rugby School under Dr James, but took offence at the headmaster&#x27;s review of his work and was removed at Dr James&#x27; request. Years later, Landor included references to James in Latin in &quot;Simonidea&quot; with a mixture of praise and criticism and was subsequently reconciled with him. He then studied privately with Rev. William Langley, vicar of Fenny Bentley and headmaster of Ashbourne Grammar School. Langley was later mentioned in the Imaginary Conversation of Isaak Walton. Landor&#x27;s temperament and violent opinions caused embarrassment at home and he was usually asked to absent himself when guests were expected. On one occasion he netted and threw in the river a local farmer who objected to his fishing on his property. In 1793 he entered Trinity College, Oxford where he showed rebelliousness in his informal dress and was known as a &quot;mad Jacobin&quot; since he was taken with ideas of French republicanism. His tutor Dr Benwell was impressed by him, but unfortunately his stay was short-lived. In 1794 he fired a gun at the windows of a Tory whose late night revels disturbed him and for whom he had an aversion. He was rusticated for a year, and, although the authorities were willing to condone the offence, he refused to return. The affair led to a quarrel with his father in which Landor expressed his intention of leaving home for ever.

Landor went to Tenby in Wales where he had a love affair with a local girl, Nancy Evans, for whom he wrote some of his earliest love poems referring to her as &quot;Ione&quot;. Landor&#x27;s father disapproved and he removed for a time to London, lodging near Portland Place. Ione subsequently had a child who died in infancy. In 1795 Landor brought out a small volume of English and Latin verse in three books entitled &quot;The Poems of Walter Savage Landor&quot;. Landor also wrote an anonymous &quot;Moral Epistle&quot; in pamphlet form of nineteen pages, respectfully dedicated to Earl Stanhope. It was a satire in heroic verse condemning Pitt for trying to suppress liberal influences. Although Landor subsequently disowned these &quot;&#x27;prentice works&quot;, Swinburne wrote: &quot;No poet at the age of twenty ever had more vigour of style and fluency of verse; nor perhaps has any ever shown such masterly command of epigram and satire, made vivid and vital by the purest enthusiasm and most generous indignation.&quot; 
Landor was reconciled with his family through the efforts of his friend Dorothea Lyttelton. He later told Forster that he would have married Dorothea if he were financially independent. He did not enter a profession—he did not want the law, and no more did the army want him. His father allowed him £150 a year, and he was free to live at home or not, as he pleased.

==South Wales and &quot;Gebir&quot;==
Landor settled in South Wales, returning home to Warwick for short visits. It was at Swansea that he became friendly with the family of Lord Aylmer, including his sister, Rose, whom Landor later immortalized in the poem, &quot;Rose Aylmer&quot;. It was she who lent him &quot;The Progress of Romance&quot; by the Gothic author Clara Reeve. In this he found the story &quot;The History of Charoba, Queen of Egypt&quot;, which inspired his poem &quot;Gebir&quot;. Rose Aylmer sailed to India with an aunt in 1798, and two years later died of cholera.


In 1798 Landor published &quot;Gebir&quot;, the work which established his reputation. This long poem tells the story of a prince of Spain who falls in love with his enemy Queen Charoba of Egypt. Southey reviewed &quot;Gebir,&quot; calling it &quot;some of the most exquisite poetry in the language&quot; and was keen to discover the anonymous author. Sidney Colvin wrote &quot;For loftiness of thought and language together, there are passages in &quot;Gebir&quot; that will bear comparison with Milton&quot; and &quot;nowhere in the works of Wordsworth or Coleridge do we find anything resembling Landor&#x27;s peculiar qualities of haughty splendour and massive concentration&quot;. John Forster wrote &quot;Style and treatment constitute the charm of it. The vividness with which everything in it is presented to sight as well as through the wealth of its imagery, its moods of language – these are characteristics pre-eminent in &quot;Gebir&quot;.&quot; Gifford, on the other hand, who was ever a harsh critic of Landor, described it as &quot;A jumble of incomprehensible trash... the most vile and despicable effusion of a mad and muddy brain...&quot;.

For the next three years Landor led an unsettled life, spent mainly in London. He became a friend of the classics scholar Dr Samuel Parr who lived at Hatton near Warwick and who appreciated Landor as a person and a Latin writer. Landor favoured Latin as a way of expressing playful material without exposing it to public view. &quot;&quot;Siquid forte iocosius cuivis in mentem veniat, id, vernacule, puderet, non-enim tantummodo in luce agitur sed etiam in publico&quot;.&quot; Latin also had the advantage of being exempt from libel laws in England. Parr introduced Landor to Robert Adair, party organiser for Charles James Fox, who enlisted Landor to write in &quot;The Morning Post&quot; and &quot;The Courier&quot; against the ministry of Pitt. Landor published &quot;Poems from the Arabic and Persian&quot; in 1800 and a pamphlet of Latin verses. During this time he met Isaac Mocatta who stimulated his interest in art and exercised a moderating influence, but Mocatta died 1801. In 1802 Landor went to Paris where he saw Napoleon at close quarters, and this was enough for him to revoke his former praise for Napoleon in &quot;Gebir&quot;. In the same year he published &quot;Poetry by the Author of Gebir&quot; which included the narrative poems &quot;Crysaor&quot; and &quot;The Phocaeans&quot;. Colvin considered &quot;Crysaor&quot; Landor&#x27;s finest piece of narrative in blank verse.

Landor&#x27;s brother Robert helped with corrections and additions to &quot;Gebir&quot; and the second edition appeared in 1803. About the same time Landor published the whole poem in Latin, which did little to increase readership but appealed to Parr and was considered by Swinburne to be comparable with the English version in might and melody of line, and for power and perfection of language.

Landor travelled the country in constant debt, spending much time at Bath. Here he met Sophia Jane Swift, who was already engaged to her cousin Godwin Swifte, whom she married despite Landor&#x27;s ardent entreaties in 1803. He called her Ianthe and wrote some of his most beautiful love poems to her. His father died in 1805, which put him in possession of an independent fortune and he settled in Bath, living in grand style. In 1806 he published &quot;Simonidea&quot; which included poems to Ianthe and Ione. It also included &quot;Gunlaug and Helga&quot; a narrative poem from William Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Select Icelandic poems&quot;. At Bristol in 1808 he caught up with Southey, whom he had missed on a trip to the Lake District in the previous year, and the mutual appreciation of the two poets led to a warm friendship. He also wrote a work &quot;The Dun Cow&quot; which was written in defence of his friend Parr who had been attacked in an anonymous work &quot;Guy&#x27;s Porridge Pot&quot;, which Landor was fierce to deny was any work of his.

==Napoleonic Wars and &quot;Count Julian&quot;==
In 1808 he had an heroic impulse to take part in the Peninsular War. At the age of 33, he left England for Spain as a volunteer to serve in the national army against Napoleon. He landed at Corunna, introduced himself to the British envoy, offered 10,000 reals for the relief of Venturada, and set out to join the army of General Joaquín Blake y Joyes. He was disappointed not to take part in any real action and found himself giving support at Bilbao where he was nearly captured. A couple of months later the Convention of Sintra brought an end to the campaign and Landor returned to England. The Spanish Government offered its thanks to him, and King Ferdinand appointed him a Colonel in the Spanish Army. However, when the King restored the Jesuits Landor returned his commission. When he returned to England, he joined Wordsworth and Southey in denouncing the Convention of Sintra, which had excited general indignation. In 1809 Landor wrote &quot;Three letters to Don Francisco Riquelme&quot; giving him the benefit of his wisdom as a participant in the war. He wrote an ode in Latin to Gustav IV of Sweden and wrote to press under various pseudonyms. In 1810 he wrote &quot;a brave and good letter to Sir Francis Burdett.&quot;

The Spanish experience provided inspiration for the tragedy of &quot;Count Julian&quot;, based on Julian, count of Ceuta. Although this demonstrated Landor&#x27;s distinctive style of writing, it suffered from his failure to study the art of drama and so made little impression. The plot is difficult to follow unless the story is previously known and concerns a complicated situation after the defeat of the last Visigoth King of Spain. It carries the moral tone of crime propagating crime. Southey undertook to arrange publication and eventually got it published by Murray in 1812, after an initial refusal by Longmans which led Landor to burn another tragedy &quot;Ferranti and Giulio&quot;. Thomas de Quincey later wrote of the work

Swinburne described it as:

==Llanthony and marriage==
Before going to Spain, he had been looking for a property and settled on Llanthony Abbey in Monmouthshire, a ruined Benedictine abbey. He sold the property at Rugeley which he inherited from his father, and persuaded his mother to sell her Tachbrook estate to contribute to the purchase cost. On his return from Spain he was busy finalising these matters. The previous owner had erected some buildings in the ruins of the ancient abbey, but an Act of Parliament, passed in 1809, was needed to allow Landor to pull down these buildings and construct a house, (which was never finished). He wanted to become a model country gentleman, planting trees, importing sheep from Spain, and improving the roads. There is still an avenue of trees in the area known as &quot;Landor&#x27;s Larches&quot; and many old chestnuts have been dated back to his time.

In 1811 he went to a ball in Bath and seeing a pretty girl exclaimed &quot;That&#x27;s the nicest girl in the room, and I&#x27;ll marry her&quot;. She was Julia Thuillier, the daughter of an impoverished Swiss banker who had an unsuccessful business at Banbury and had gone to Spain, leaving his family at Bath. They married at St James&#x27; Church, Bath on 24 May 1811 and settled for a while at Llanthony Abbey. Landor had a visit from Southey, after he sent him a letter describing the idylls of country life, including nightingales and glow-worms. However the idyll was not to last long as for the next three years Landor was worried by the combined vexation of neighbours and tenants, lawyers and lords-lieutenant and even the Bishop of St David&#x27;s, while at the same time he tried to publish an article on Fox, a response to a sycophantic piece by John Bernard Trotter, which was condemned by the prospective publisher John Murray as libellous and damned by Canning and Gifford.

His troubles with the neighbours stemmed from petty squabbles, many arising from his headstrong and impetuous nature. He employed a solicitor, one Charles Gabell, who saw him as a client to be milked. His trees were uprooted and his timber stolen. A man against whom he had to swear the peace drank himself to death, and he was accused of causing the misfortune and when he prosecuted a man for theft he was insulted by the defendant&#x27;s counsel (whom he later &quot;chastised&quot; in his Latin poetry). He was fond of revenge through his verse, Latin or otherwise and gave his opinion of his lawyers in the following piece of doggerel.

When the Bishop failed to reply to his letter offering to restore part of the priory Landor followed up saying &quot;God alone is great enough for me to ask anything of twice&quot;. He wanted to become a magistrate and after a row with the Lord Lieutenant, the Duke of Beaufort, who was suspicious of his republican sympathies, he pursued the matter with the Lord Chancellor, Lord Eldon, well known as a High Tory, without success. He wasted much effort and money in noble attempts to improve the land, and to relieve the wretchedness and raise the condition of the poorer inhabitants. The final straw was when he let his farmland to one Betham who was incompetent and extravagant and paid no rent. After an expensive action to recover the debts from Betham he had had enough, and decided to leave the country, abandoning Llanthony to his creditors – which was principally his mother. He had drafted a book-length &quot;Commentary on the Memoires of Mr. Charles Fox&quot; which presents the radical Whig leader in a positive light and includes a dedication to American president James Madison and strong criticism of the Tory government and Canning, but left it unpublished for fear of prosecution.
In 1814 Landor left England for Jersey, where he had a quarrel with his wife and set off for France on his own. Eventually she joined him at Tours as did his brother Robert. At Tours he met Francis George Hare, father of Augustus Hare and brother of Julius Hare who was to be of great help to him. Landor soon became dissatisfied with Tours and after tremendous conflicts with his landlady set off in September 1815 with his wife and brother on a tempestuous journey to Italy.

==Florence and &quot;Imaginary Conversations&quot;==


Landor and his wife finally settled at Como, where they stayed for three years. Even here he had troubles, for at the time Caroline of Brunswick, wife of the Prince Regent was living there and Landor was suspected of being an agent involved in watching her in case of divorce proceedings. In 1818 he insulted the authorities in a Latin poem directed against an Italian poet who had denounced England, not realising that the libel laws in Italy (unlike in England) applied to Latin writings as well as Italian. After threatening the regio delegato with a beating he was ordered to leave Como. In September he went to Genoa and Pisa. He finally settled at Florence in 1821. After two years in apartments in the Medici Palace, he settled with his wife and children at the Villa Castiglione. In this, the most important period in his literary career, he produced some of his best known works – the Imaginary Conversations. It was at this time that Lady Blessington and her husband were living at Florence and became firm friends.

The first two volumes of his &quot;Imaginary Conversations&quot; appeared in 1824 with a second edition in 1826; a third volume was added in 1828; and in 1829 the fourth and fifth volumes were published. Not until 1846 was a fresh instalment added, in the second volume of his collected and selected works. Many of the imaginary conversations harshly criticize authoritarian rule and endorse republican principles.

With these works, Landor acquired a high, but not wide literary reputation. He had various disputes with the authorities in Florence. The theft of some silver led to altercations with the police, whose interviews with tradesmen ended up defining him as a &quot;dangerous man&quot;, and the eventual upshot was that the Grand Duke banished him from Florence. Subsequently, the Grand Duke took the matter good-naturedly, and ignored Landor&#x27;s declaration that, as the authorities disliked his residence, he should reside there permanently. In 1829, Landor bought the Villa Gherardesca at Fiesole helped by a generous loan from Joseph Ablett of Llanbedr Hall, Denbighshire. Here he had a dispute with a neighbour about water rights, which led to a lawsuit and a challenge, although the English Consul Kirkup succeeded in arranging the point of honour satisfactorily. Landor was visited by William Hazlitt and Leigh Hunt, and was on intimate terms with Charles Armitage Brown. It was at this time he became acquainted with Edward John Trelawny whom he included in volume IV of &quot;Imaginary Conversations&quot;. His mother, with whom he had always corresponded affectionately, died in October 1829 and his cousin Walter Landor of Rugeley took over the management of the estate in Wales. Landor was happy at Villa Gherardesca for several years, writing books, playing with his children whom he adored and with the nightingales, and planting his gardens. He had many visitors, most notably in 1829 Jane Swift (Ianthe) now a widow, who inspired him to write poetry again. Later came Henry Crabb Robinson with whom he got on extremely well. In 1831 he published a volume combining &quot;Gebir&quot;, Count Julian and Other Poems (including 31 to Ianthe). Although this sold only 40 copies, Landor was unconcerned as he was working on &quot;High and Low Life in Italy&quot;. This last work he sent to Crabb Robinson for publication but he had difficulties with publishers and it did not appear until 1837.

In 1832 Ablett persuaded him to visit England, where he met many old friends. He saw Ianthe at Brighton and met Lord Wenlock. He also visited his family in Staffordshire – his brother Charles was rector of Colton, and his cousin Walter Landor of Rugeley was trying to deal with the complex business of Llanthony. He visited Charles Lamb at Enfield, Samuel Coleridge at Highgate, and Julius Hare at Cambridge. He went with Ablett to the Lake District and saw Southey and Coleridge.

On returning to Fiesole he found his children out of hand and obtained a German governess for them. Back in Italy he met Richard Monckton Milnes who later wrote about him. He was visited by Ralph Waldo Emerson and worked on the conversations which led to the volumes upon &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Examinations for Deer Stealing&quot;, &quot;Pericles and Aspasia&quot;, and the &quot;Pentameron&quot;. Lady Blessington sold &quot;Shakespeare&quot; for him. In 1835 Ianthe visited again, and brought her half-sister, Mrs Paynter, with her. Landor&#x27;s wife Julia became jealous, although she already had a younger lover, and their difference of opinion ended in a complete separation.

==England, Pericles and journalism==
Landor was 60 by now and went to Lucca, where he finished &quot;Pericles and Aspasia&quot; and in September returned to England alone in the autumn. He had an income of about £600 per annum from properties in England, but when he left Italy he made over £400 of the share to his wife, and transferred the villa and farms at Fiesole to his son Arnold absolutely. His income was now £200 a year and he was in financial difficulties. He stayed with Ablett at Llanbedr for three months, spent winter at Clifton and returned to him afterwards, when Ablett persuaded him to contribute to &quot;Literary Hours&quot; which was published the next year. &quot;Pericles and Aspasia&quot;, which was to become one of his most appreciated works, was published in March 1836. It is in the form of an Imaginary Conversation and describes the development of Aspasia&#x27;s romance with Pericles, who died in the Peloponnesian War, told in a series of letters to a friend Cleone. The work is one of Landor&#x27;s most joyous works and is singled out by contemporary critics as an introduction to Landor at his best. On one occasion Landor was travelling to Clifton incognito and chatting to a fellow traveller when the traveller, John Sterling, observed that his strange paradoxical conversation sounded like one of Landor&#x27;s Imaginary Conversations. Landor covered his retreat, but later became acquainted formally with Sterling.

Also in 1836, Landor met John Forster who became his biographer, having become friends after Forster&#x27;s review of his &quot;Shakespeare&quot;. Later that year he went to Heidelberg in Germany hoping to meet his children, but was disappointed. He wrote more imaginary conversations including one between Lord Eldon and Escombe. When a lady friend rebuked him for this on the basis that Eldon was now over eighty, Landor replied unmoved with the quip &quot;The devil is older&quot;. He had several other publications that year besides Pericles, including &quot;Letter from a Conservative&quot;, &quot;A Satire on Satirists&quot; which included a criticism of Wordsworth&#x27;s failure to appreciate Southey, Alabiadas the Young Man, and &quot;Terry Hogan&quot;, a satire on Irish priests. He wintered again at Clifton where Southey visited him. It is possible that Ianthe was living at Bristol, but the evidence is not clear, and in 1837 she went to Austria, where she remained for some years. After leaving Clifton, Landor travelled around and visited Armitage Brown at Plymouth. He established many friendships including John Kenyon and Sir William Napier. At the end of the year he published &quot;Death of Clytemnestra&quot; and &quot;The Pentalogia&quot;, containing five of his finest shorter studies in dramatic poetry. The last piece to be published was &quot;Pentameron&quot;. Although this had no financial success it was much admired by his friends including Kenyon, Julius Hare, Crabb Robinson, Elizabeth Barrett Browning who said &quot;some of the pages are too delicious to turn over&quot;, and Leigh Hunt who reckoned it Landor&#x27;s masterpiece. In the spring of 1838 he took a house in Bath and wrote his three plays the &quot;Andrea of Hungary&quot;, &quot;Giovanna of Naples&quot;, and &quot;Fra Rupert&quot;. These plays are in the form of a trilogy in the first of which Fra Rupert contrives the death of Andrea, husband of Giovanna. Giovanna is suspected but acquitted in the second play. In the third play Fra Rupert is discovered. George Saintsbury described these as a historical novel thrown into conversational dramatic form. In 1839 Landor&#x27;s attempts to publish the plays were caught up in a dispute between Bentley and Dickens and Forster which caused considerable delay. Again, although these plays, or &quot;conversations in verse&quot; did not succeed with the public, Landor gained warm admirers, many of whom were his personal friends. Southey&#x27;s mind was giving way when he wrote a last letter to his friend in 1839, but he continued to mention Landor&#x27;s name when generally incapable of mentioning anyone. Landor wandered around the country again, frequently visiting London, where he usually stayed with Lady Blessington, whom he had known at Florence. Mrs Paynter and her daughter Rose Paynter were at Bath, and Landor&#x27;s letters and verses to Rose are among his best works. Rose later married Charles Graves-Sawle of Penrice in Cornwall. Landor met Charles Dickens and they enjoyed each other&#x27;s company despite the age difference. Landor greatly admired Dickens&#x27;s works, and was especially moved by the character of Nell Trent (from &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;). Landor was affectionately adapted by Dickens as Lawrence Boythorn in &quot;Bleak House&quot;. He was the godfather of Dickens&#x27;s son Walter Landor Dickens. He also became introduced to Robert Browning, who sent him a dedicated copy of his work.

Landor received a visit from his son Arnold in 1842 and in that year wrote a long essay on Catullus for Forster, who was editor of &quot;Foreign Quarterly Review&quot;; he followed it up with The Idylls of Theocritus. R. H. Super was critical of the essays claiming &quot;A more thoroughly disorganised work never fell from his pen&quot;. In 1843 he mourned the death of his friend Southey and dedicated a poem in the Examiner. Landor was visited by his children Walter and Julia and published a poem to Julia in Blackwood&#x27;s magazine.

In the following year his daughter Julia returned and gave him a dog Pomero, who was a faithful companion for a long time. In the same year, he published a poem to Browning in the Morning Chronicle.

Forster and Dickens used to visit Bath, to celebrate Landor&#x27;s birthday and Charles I&#x27;s execution on the same day. Forster helped Landor in publishing his plays and the &#x27;Collected Works&#x27; in 1846, and was employed on &quot;The Examiner&quot; to which Landor frequently contributed on political and other subjects. Forster objected to the inclusion of some Latin poetry, and so Landor published his most important Latin work &#x27;Poemata et Inscriptiones&#x27; separately in 1847. This consisted of large additions to the main contents of two former volumes of idyllic, satiric, elegiac and lyric verse. One piece referred to George IV whose treatment of Caroline of Brunswick had been distasteful to Landor. 

Landor&#x27;s distaste for the House of Hanover is more famously displayed in the doggerel that many do not realise is his composition:
In 1846 he also published the &quot;Hellenics&quot;, including the poems published under that title in the collected works, together with English translations of the Latin idyls. In this year he first met Eliza Lynn who was to become an outstanding novelist and journalist as Lynn Linton, and she became a regular companion in Bath. Now aged over 70, Landor was losing many of his old friends and becoming more frequently ill himself. On one occasion when staying with the Graves-Sawle he visited Exeter and sheltered in the rain on the doorstep of a local barrister, James Jerwood. Jerwood mistook him for a tramp and drove him away. Landor&#x27;s follow-up letter of abuse to the barrister is magnificent: highlighting the man&#x27;s &quot;insulting language ... violent demeanour&quot; and &quot;coarseness and vehemence&quot;; casting doubt on Jerwood&#x27;s education (particularly in Latin); observing &quot;Barristers in general carry a change of tongue about them, altho (sic) some of them do not put on a clean one so often as we could wish&quot;; and lecturing him on the proprieties and &quot;decency&quot; involved in interacting not only with gentlemen- Landor firmly establishing himself amongst them- but with &quot;even the lowest of men&quot;. R. H. Super, in his &quot;Walter Savage Landor- A Biography&quot; (1954) observes that &quot;the very survival of this letter shows that Jerwood, when he received it, at least knew with whom he had to deal... it warms the heart to see that Landor&#x27;s sharpest thrust was the suggestion that his man could not read Latin&quot;.

In 1849 he wrote a well-known epitaph for himself on his 74th birthday:

However he was leading an active social life. Tennyson met him in 1850 and recorded how while another guest fell downstairs and broke his arm, &quot;Old Landor went on eloquently discoursing of Catullus and other Latin poets as if nothing had happened&quot;. Thomas Carlyle visited him and wrote &quot;He was really stirring company: a proud irascible, trenchant, yet generous, veracious, and very dignified old man&quot;. 
In 1851 Landor expressed interest in Church reform with a pamphlet &quot;Popery, British and Foreign&quot;, and Letters to Cardinal Wiseman. He published various other articles in The Examiner, Fraser&#x27;s Magazine and other journals. During the year he learnt of the death of his beloved Ianthe and wrote in tribute to her:

In 1853 he published the collected &quot;Imaginary Conversations of the Greeks and Romans&quot;, which he dedicated to Dickens. Dickens in this year published &quot;Bleak House,&quot; which contained the amazingly realistic characterisation of Landor as Boythorn. He also published &quot;The Last Fruit off an Old Tree,&quot; containing fresh conversations, critical and controversial essays, miscellaneous epigrams, lyrics and occasional poems of various kind and merit, closing with &quot;Five Scenes on the Martyrdom of Beatrice Cenci&quot;. Swinburne described these as &quot;unsurpassed even by their author himself for noble and heroic pathos, for subtle and genial, tragic and profound, ardent and compassionate insight into character, with consummate mastery of dramatic and spiritual truth.&quot; At this time Landor was interesting himself in foreign affairs, in particular Czarist oppression as he saw it and Louis Napoleon. At the end of 1854 his beloved sister Elizabeth died and he wrote a touching memorial:

In 1856 at the age of 81 he published &quot;Antony and Octavius: Scenes for the Study&quot;, twelve consecutive poems in dialogue, and &quot;Letter to Emerson&quot;, as well as continuing Imaginary Conversations.

==Final tragedies and return to Italy==
In the beginning of 1857, Landor&#x27;s mind was becoming weakened and he found himself in some unpleasant situations. He became involved in a court case because he had published statements when the case was sub judice and was insulted by counsel as a poor old man brought in to talk twaddle. He then became embroiled in a miserable quarrel between two ladies he knew. He gave one of them, Geraldine Hooper, £100, a legacy received from his friend Kenyon. Unknown to Landor she transferred half of it to the other lady, a Mrs Yescombe. They then quarreled and Mrs Yescombe accused Hooper of having obtained the money from Landor for dishonourable reasons. Landor in his fury wrote a pamphlet &quot;Walter Savage Landor and the Honourable Mrs Yescombe,&quot; which was considered libellous. Forster persuaded Landor to apologise. Then in 1858 he produced a miscellaneous collection called &quot;Dry Sticks Fagoted by W. S. Landor,&quot; which contained among other things some epigrammatic and satirical attacks which led to further libel actions.
In July that year Landor returned to Italy for the last six years of his life. He was advised to make over his property to his family, on whom he now depended. He hoped to resume his life with his wife and children but found them living disreputably at the Villa Gherardesca and ill-disposed to welcome him. He spent a miserable ten months at his villa, and fled repeatedly to Florence, only to be brought back again. On the last occasion, he took refuge at a hotel in Florence, with next to nothing in his pocket, and was found by Robert Browning then living at the Casa Guidi. Browning managed to obtain an allowance for him from the family and settled him first at Siena and then at Florence.

Landor busied himself with new editions of his works and interested himself in the unification of Italy. He wrote frequently to Eliza Lynn Linton and added to Imaginary Conversations devising any sale proceeds to the relief of Garibaldi&#x27;s soldiers. Anthony Trollope visited Florence and brought with him an American girl, Kate Field, who became Landor&#x27;s protégée. He was still charming, venerable, and courteous, and full of literary interests. He taught Kate Field Latin, repeated poetry and composed some last conversations. In 1861, Browning left Italy after the death of his wife. Landor afterwards seldom left the house and remained petulant and uncomfortable, occasionally visited by his sons. He was much concerned about the fate of his picture collection, little of which had any merit, and about preparations for his grave as he hoped to be buried at Widcombe near Bath. He published some Imaginary Conversations in the &#x27;Atheneum&#x27; in 1861-2 and in 1863 published a last volume of &quot;Heroic Idyls, with Additional Poems, English and Latin&quot;, described by Swinburne as &quot; the last fruit of a genius which after a life of eighty-eight years had lost nothing of its majestic and pathetic power, its exquisite and exalted&quot;. Forster&#x27;s refusal to publish more about the libel case had interrupted their friendship, but they renewed their correspondence before his death. Almost the last event of his life was a visit in 1864 from the poet Swinburne, who visited Florence specifically to see him, and dedicated to him the &#x27;Atlanta in Calydon&#x27;. In 1864 on May Day Landor said to his landlady &quot;I shall never write again. Put out the lights and draw the curtains&quot;. A few months later he died quietly in Florence at the age of 89. He was buried not after all at Widcombe but in the English Cemetery, Florence, near the tomb of his friend, Elizabeth Barrett Browning. A statue of his wife can also be found in the &#x27;English&#x27; Cemetery, above the tomb of their son, Arnold Savage Landor. In England a memorial bust to Landor was later placed in the Church of St Mary&#x27;s, Warwick. Later, his Villa Gherardesca in Fiesole would become the home of the American Icelandic scholar Daniel Willard Fiske, who renamed it the &#x27;Villa Landor&#x27;. Landor&#x27;s grandson was the writer explorer and adventurer Arnold Henry Savage Landor.

Landor was a close friend of Southey and Coleridge. His relationship with Wordsworth changed over time from great praise to a certain resentment. Lord Byron tended to ridicule and revile him, and though Landor had little good to say in return during Byron&#x27;s life, he lamented and extolled him as a dead hero. He lavished sympathetic praise on the noble dramatic works of his brother Robert Eyres Landor.

==Review of Landor&#x27;s work by Swinburne==
Swinburne wrote in the ninth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (replicated in the eleventh edition) and later published in his &quot;Miscellanies&quot; of 1886 an appreciation which included the following passage (here broken into paragraphs for easier reading):

From nineteen almost to ninety his intellectual and literary activity was indefatigably incessant; but, herein at least like Charles Lamb, whose cordial admiration he so cordially returned, he could not write a note of three lines which did not bear the mark of his Roman hand in its matchless and inimitable command of a style at once the most powerful and the purest of his age.

The one charge which can ever seriously be brought and maintained against it is that of such occasional obscurity or difficulty as may arise from excessive strictness in condensation of phrase and expurgation of matter not always superfluous, and sometimes almost indispensable. His English prose and his Latin verse are perhaps more frequently and more gravely liable to this charge than either his English verse or his Latin prose. At times it is well-nigh impossible for an eye less keen and swift, a scholarship less exquisite and ready than his own, to catch the precise direction and follow the perfect course of his rapid thought and radiant utterance.

This apparently studious pursuit and preference of the most terse and elliptic expression which could be found for anything he might have to say could not but occasionally make even so sovereign a master of two great languages appear dark with excess of light; but from no former master of either tongue in prose or verse was ever the quality of real obscurity, of loose and nebulous incertitude, more utterly alien or more naturally remote. There is nothing of cloud or fog about the path on which he leads us; but we feel now and then the want of a bridge or a handrail; we have to leap from point to point of narrative or argument without the usual help of a connecting plank. Even in his dramatic works, where least of all it should have been found, this lack of visible connection or sequence in details of thought or action is too often a source of sensible perplexity. In his noble trilogy on the history of Giovanna queen of Naples it is sometimes actually difficult to realize on a first reading what has happened or is happening, or how, or why, or by what agency a defect alone sufficient, but unhappily sufficient in itself, to explain the too general ignorance of a work so rich in subtle and noble treatment of character, so sure and strong in its grasp and rendering of high actions and high passions, so rich in humour and in pathos, so royally serene in its commanding power upon the tragic mainsprings of terror and of pity.

As a poet, he may be said on the whole to stand midway between Byron and Shelley—about as far above the former as below the latter. If we except Catullus and Simonides, it might be hard to match and it would be impossible to overmatch the flawless and blameless yet living and breathing beauty of his most perfect elegies, epigrams or epitaphs. As truly as prettily was he likened by Leigh Hunt to a stormy mountain pine which should produce lilies. He was a classic, and no formalist; the wide range of his admiration had room for a genius so far from classical as Blake&#x27;s. Nor in his own highest mood or method of creative as of critical work was he a classic only, in any narrow or exclusive sense of the term. On either side, immediately or hardly below his mighty masterpiece of &quot;Pericles and Aspasia&quot;, stand the two scarcely less beautiful and vivid studies of medieval Italy and Shakespeare in England.

==In popular culture==
Landor&#x27;s &quot;I Strove with None&quot; is widely mentioned and discussed. Somerset Maugham used it in &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot;, as does Tom Wolfe in &quot;A Man in Full&quot; location 8,893 (Kindle). Thomas Savage inserted it in chapter 6 of &quot;The Sheep Queen&quot;. In Josephine Pullein-Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Pony Club Team&quot;, the second novel in her West Barsetshire series of pony books, it is quoted by both Noel Kettering and Henry Thornton. The poem forms the chorus of the Zatopeks&#x27; song &quot;Death and the Hobo,&quot; from their album &quot;Damn Fool Music&quot;.

In an episode of &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;The Spy Who Came In for a Cold One,&quot; Ellis Rabb&#x27;s guest character plagiarizes Landor&#x27;s &quot;She I Love (Alas in Vain!)&quot; when reciting poetry to Diane. He also plagiarizes Christina Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;A Birthday.&quot;

In his book of poems &quot;The Drunken Driver Has the Right of Way&quot;, Academy Award-winning writer/director/producer Ethan Coen facetiously describes himself as &quot;an expert on the poetry of Walter Savage Landor and many other subjects which he travels the world to lecture upon, unsolicited&quot;.

Author Iris Murdoch quotes Landor &quot;There are no voices that are not soon mute...&quot; in the penultimate paragraph of her novel, The Unicorn.

==Artistic recognition==
A bust of Landor dated 1828 by John Gibson is held in the National Portrait Gallery, London.

<text>Mount Terror is an extinct volcano about high on Ross Island, Antarctica, about eastward of Mount Erebus.
Mount Terror was named in 1841 by polar explorer Sir James Clark Ross for his second ship, HMS &quot;Terror&quot;.

==Geology==
Mount Terror is a shield volcano that forms the eastern part of Ross Island, Antarctica. 
It has numerous cinder cones and domes on the flanks of the shield and is mostly under snow and ice. It is the second-largest of the four volcanoes that make up Ross Island.

==Geography==

The rocks at the summit have not been studied, but rocks from the lower areas range from 0.82 to 1.75 million years old, and Mount Terror shows no signs of more recent volcanic activity.
The first ascent of Mount Terror was made by a New Zealand party in 1959.
The mountain is to the west of Cape Crozier, and east of Mount Terra Nova and Mount Erebus.

==Central features==
===Kienle Nunataks ===
Three aligned nunataks to the north of Mount Terror in northeast Ross Island. The nunataks trend east-west for and rise to about . 
The central nunatak is north-northeast of the Mount Terror summit. At the suggestion of P.R. Kyle, named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) after Juergen Kienle (d.), Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska, Fairbanks, a United States Antarctic Project (USAP) team leader for the investigation of volcanic activity and seismicity on Mount Erebus in six field seasons, 1980-81 through 1985-86.

=== Mount Sutherland===
A peak west-northwest of the summit of Mount Terror on Ross Island. The feature rises to about . 
Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (2000) after Alexander L. Sutherland, Jr., Ocean Projects Manager, OPP, NSF, with responsibility for directing operations and logistics for United States Antarctic Project (USAP) research vessels from 1989; responsible for acquisition of the Research Vessel/Ice Breakers Nathaniel B. Palmer and Laurence M. Gould.

===Rohnke Crests===
Two rock ridges, about high, that are parallel and rise above the general ice mantle on the southeast slopes of Mount Terror. 
This feature is east of the head of Eastwind Glacier and northeast of Conical Hill. Names in association with Eastwind Glacier after Captain (later Rear Admiral) Oscar C. Rohnke, USCG, who commanded United States Coast Guard Cutter (USCGC) Eastwind in Ross Sea during United States Navy (United States Navy) Operation Deep Freeze (OpDFrz) I, 1955-56.

=== Moore Peak===
A peak rising to high on the west slope of Mount Terror, Ross Island. The peak is west-southwest of the summit of Mount Terror and south of Mount Sutherland. At the suggestion of P.R. Kyle, named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (2000) after James A. Moore, a member of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology team on Mount Erebus in the 1983–84 and 1985-86 field seasons. He completed his M.S. thesis on the geology of Mount Erebus.

=== Ohau Peak===
A sharp rock peak northeast of the summit of Mount Terror on Ross Island. 
The feature rises to about high and is central in three aligned summits north of Mount McIntosh. 
Named by New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) (2000) after a peak near the locality of Tekapo (see Tekapo Ridge), New Zealand.

==Giggenbach Ridge==
A north-south chain of summits, long, located to the west and northwest of Mount Terror. 
The ridge rises to about west of Mount Terror, but descends to at the north end. 
Named at the suggestion of P.R. Kyle, named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (2000) after Werner F. Giggenbach, Chemistry Division, DSIR, who worked in the NZAP at Mount Erebus in four field seasons during the 1970s. 
He rappelled into the Inner Crater of Mount Erebus in 1978, but had to be pulled out when an eruption showered him and colleagues on the crater rim with volcanic bombs.
He was one of the leading volcanic gas geochemists of the period.

=== Chuan Peak===
A peak, about high, located northeast of Barker Peak in the south part of Giggenbach Ridge, Ross Island. 
At the suggestion of P.R. Kyle, named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (2000) after Raymond L. Chuan who, as a scientist with the Brunswick Corporation, Costa Mesa, CA, undertook many airborne surveys of volcanic aerosols from Mount Erebus and also did sampling at the crater rim, 1983–84 and 1986–87; investigator (with Julie Palais) on a project which examined aerosols between Mount Erebus and the South Pole.

=== Manahan Peak===
A prominent peak east of Giggenbach Ridge in northeast Ross Island. The peak rises to over high northwest of the summit of Mount Terror. Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (2000) after biologist Donal T. Manahan, who worked eight seasons in Antarctica from 1983; United States Antarctic Project (USAP) prinicipal investigator in study of early stages (embryos larvae) of marine animals; chair, Polar Research Board, National Academy of Sciences, 2000.

=== Barker Peak===
A peak west-northwest of Mount Terror on Ross Island. The feature rises to about high and is the western of two peaks near the south end of Giggenbach Ridge. Name by New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) (2000) after Major James R. M. Barker, officer in command at Scott Base, 1970–71; a NZAP manager, 1970-86.

=== Joyce Peak===
A peak rising to over high in the north-central part of Ross Island. 
It stands west of the main summits of Giggenbach Ridge and south-southeast of Wyandot Point. 
Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (2000) after Karen Joyce, a long-term ASA employee, who from 1990 made 10 deployments to McMurdo Station, including a winter-over; assisted with computers in the Crary Science and Engineering Center.

=== Kristin Peak===
A peak rising to over high at the north end of Giggenbach Ridge on Ross Island. 
The feature is south of Cape Tennyson. 
Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) (2000) after Kristin Larson, who has participated in support activities to United States Antarctic Project (USAP) from 1988, including two winters at McMurdo Station; supervisor, Eklund Biological Center and Thiel Labs, 1988 and 1992; supervisor, Crary Science and Engineering Center, 1992–95; editor, The Antarctican Society newsletter from 1996; later of staff of OPP, NSF.

==Eastern features==
Features to the east, towards the Kyle Hills, include:

===Tent Peak===
A tent-shaped peak rising to about high midway between Mount Terror and Cape Crozier. 
It was descriptively named by a party of the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE), 1958–59, which occupied the peak as an astronomical control station, January 5, 1959, and erected a tent below the peak.

===The Tooth===
A distinctive rock outcrop on the eastern slopes of Mount Terror at an elevation of about . 
The feature lies south-southeast of Tent Peak and is reported to resemble a fossilized shark&#x27;s tooth. 
Descriptively named by a party of the NZGSAE, 1958–59, working in eastern Ross Island.

=== Slattery Peak===
A somewhat isolated rock peak, about high, that rises above the ice mantle southeast of Mount Terror. 
The peak position is additionally defined as southwest of The Knoll and east-northeast of Rohnke Crests. 
Named after Leo Slattery, who wintered at Scott Base three times, twice as Officer in Charge; Post Clerk on Ross Island, summer 1973-74; Postmaster on Ross Island, summers 1979-80, 1981–82, and 1983–84.

===Pönui Nunatak===
A nunatak located southeast of Slattery Peak and southwest of The Knoll. The feature rises to high near the juncture of the island and Ross Ice Shelf. The name Ponui (meaning south wind) is one of several Maori wind names applied by New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) in this vicinity.

===Conical Hill===
A small but distinctive rock hill, high, on the south slopes of Mount Terror, above Cape MacKay. 
Given this descriptive name by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13, under Scott.

<text>&quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot; is a traditional English nursery rhyme, folksong, and singing game which refers to the bells of several churches, all within or close to the City of London. It is listed in the Roud Folk Song Index as No 13190. The earliest known printed version appeared c. 1744.

The rhyme has been referenced in a variety of works of literature and popular culture. The bells of St Clement Danes (one of many London churches associated with the rhyme) play the tune every day at 9am, noon, 3pm and 6pm.

&lt;poem&gt;Oranges and lemons,
Say the bells of St. Clement&#x27;s.

You owe me five farthings,
Say the bells of St. Martin&#x27;s.

When will you pay me?
Say the bells at Old Bailey.

When I grow rich,
Say the bells at Shoreditch.

When will that be?
Say the bells of Stepney.

I do not know,
Says the great bell at Bow.

Here comes a candle to light you to bed,
And here comes a chopper to chop off your head!
Chip chop chip chop the last man is dead

==Melody==

The tune is reminiscent of change ringing, and the intonation of each line is said to correspond with the distinct sounds of each church&#x27;s bells. Today, the bells of St Clement Danes ring out the tune of the rhyme—as reported in 1940 the church&#x27;s playing of the tune was interrupted during World War II due to Nazi bombing of the church during the Blitz. As is the case with almost all traditional songs, there were minor variations in the melody. Collector of British folk songs, James Madison Carpenter, recorded two versions of the song in the 1930s which are now available on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website: one in Garsington, Oxfordshire, and another somewhere in either Yorkshire or Lincolnshire. These recordings show slight melodic and lyrical variations.

==As a game==

The song is used in a children&#x27;s singing game with the same name, in which the players file, in pairs, through an arch made by two of the players (made by having the players face each other, raise their arms over their head, and clasp their partners&#x27; hands). The challenge comes during the final lines beginning &quot;Here comes a chopper to chop off your head&quot;; and on the final repetition of &quot;chop&quot; in the last line, the children forming the arch drop their arms to catch the pair of children currently passing through. These are then &quot;out&quot; and must form another arch next to the existing one. In this way, the series of arches becomes a steadily lengthening tunnel through which each set of two players has to run faster and faster to escape in time.

Alternative versions of the game include: children caught &quot;out&quot; by the last rhyme may stand behind one of the children forming the original arch, instead of forming additional arches; and children forming &quot;arches&quot; may bring their hands down for each word of the last line, while the children passing through the arches run as fast as they can to avoid being caught on the last word.

==Origins and meaning==

Various theories have been advanced to account for the rhyme, including: that it deals with child sacrifice; that it describes public executions; that it describes Henry VIII&#x27;s marital difficulties. Problematically for these theories the last two lines, with their different metre, do not appear in the earlier recorded versions of the rhyme, including the first printed in &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Pretty Song Book&quot; (c. 1744), where the lyrics are:

&lt;poem&gt;Two Sticks and Apple,
Ring ye Bells at Whitechapple,
Old Father Bald Pate,
Ring ye Bells Aldgate,
Maids in White Aprons,
Ring ye Bells a St. Catherines,
Oranges and Lemons,
Ring ye bells at St. Clements,
When will you pay me,
Ring ye Bells at ye Old Bailey,
When I am Rich,
Ring ye Bells at Fleetditch,
When will that be,
Ring ye Bells at Stepney,
When I am Old,
Ring ye Bells at Pauls.&lt;/poem&gt;

There is considerable variation in the churches and lines attached to them in versions printed in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, which makes any overall meaning difficult to establish. The final two lines of the modern version were first collected by James Orchard Halliwell in the 1840s.

&quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot; was the title of a square dance, published from the third (1657) edition onwards of &quot;The Dancing Master&quot;. Similar rhymes naming churches and giving rhymes to their names can be found in other parts of England, including Shropshire and Derby, where they were sung on festival days on which bells would also have been rung.

The identity of the London churches is not always clear, but the following have been suggested, along with some factors that may have influenced the accompanying statements:
*St. Clement&#x27;s may be St Clement Danes or St Clement Eastcheap, both of which are near the wharves where merchantmen landed citrus fruits.
*St. Martin&#x27;s may be St Martin Orgar in the City, or St Martin-in-the-Fields near Trafalgar Square.
*St Sepulchre-without-Newgate (opposite the Old Bailey) is near the Fleet Prison where debtors were held.
*St Leonard&#x27;s, Shoreditch is just outside the old City walls.
*St Dunstan&#x27;s, Stepney is also outside the City walls.
*Bow is St Mary-le-Bow in Cheapside.
*St. Helen&#x27;s, in the longer version of the song, is St Helen&#x27;s Bishopsgate, in the City.
*&quot;Whitechapple&quot; may refer to St Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel, or to the Whitechapel Bell Foundry which began making bells in 1570. &quot;Two sticks and an apple&quot; may refer to handbells.
*St. Catherine&#x27;s is most likely St Katharine Cree, Aldgate. &quot;Maids in white aprons&quot; could be local market-sellers.
*St. Margaret&#x27;s is St Margaret Lothbury.
*St. Giles&#x27; is St Giles Cripplegate.
*St. Peter&#x27;s is St Peter upon Cornhill. &quot;Pancakes and fritters&quot; may refer to foods sold nearby, as it was a grain market.
*&quot;Fleetditch&quot; is St Pancras Old Church, located near the River Fleet.
*St. John&#x27;s is St John&#x27;s Chapel in the Tower of London; &quot;pokers and tongs&quot; may allude to instruments of torture used on prisoners. It could also be St John Clerkenwell.
*St. Anne&#x27;s is St Anne and St Agnes near the Barbican. &quot;Kettles and pans&quot; may refer to nearby coppersmiths.
*&quot;Aldgate&quot; is St Botolph&#x27;s Aldgate, while &quot;old father baldpate&quot; refers to the monk Saint Botolph. It may also be an allusion to the glans penis, as St Botolph&#x27;s was notorious for being a meeting-place for prostitutes.

==Song settings==

Bob Chilcott&#x27;s &quot;London Bells&quot;, the third movement of his &quot;Songs and Cries of London Town&quot; (2001) is a setting for choir of the song&#x27;s version from &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Pretty Song Book&quot;.

Benjamin Till composed music based upon the nursery rhyme which was performed in 2009 at St Mary-le-Bow, London, to commemorate 150 years of the Palace of Westminster&#x27;s great bell, Big Ben.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot; and people remembering the words to it is a common motif in &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; by George Orwell.
*&quot;The God Complex&quot;, a 2011 episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, quotes the line &quot;Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head.&quot;

==See also==
*&quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot;, another English nursery rhyme that plays a similar game to &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;.
*&quot;The Bells of Rhymney&quot;, a similar song about church bells, although in Wales as opposed to London and also telling the story of labour disputes in the mining industry. The stanzas follow the pattern of &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;.

<text>The Fort Parker massacre, also known as the Fort Parker raid, was an event in which a group of Texian colonists were killed in an attack by a contingent of Comanche, Kiowa, Caddo, and Wichita raiders at Fort Parker on May 19, 1836. During the attack, Cynthia Ann Parker, then approximately nine years old, was captured and spent most of the rest of her life within the Comanche Nation, later marrying Chief Peta Nocona and giving birth to three children, including a son, Quanah Parker, who became a prominent leader of the Comanches and a war leader during the Red River War of 1874–75. Cynthia’s brother John Richard Parker was also captured and remained with the Comanches for six years before his release was negotiated. He was unable to readapt to Western society and chose to return to the Comanche Nation.

==Background==

Fort Parker was established about north of present-day Groesbeck, Limestone County, Texas, United States, by John Parker, his sons, Benjamin, Silas and James, with other members of the &quot;Pilgrim Predestinarian Baptist Church&quot; of Crawford County, Illinois. Led by John and Daniel Parker, they came to Texas in 1833. Daniel&#x27;s party first settled in Grimes County, then later moved to Anderson County near present-day Elkhart and established Pilgrim Church. Elder John Parker&#x27;s group settled near the headwaters of the Navasota River, and built a fort for protection against Native Americans. It was completed in March 1834. Fort Parker&#x27;s log walls enclosed . Blockhouses were placed on two corners for lookouts, and six cabins were attached to the inside walls. The fort had two entrances, a large double gate facing south, and a small gate for easy access to the spring. Most of the residents of the fort were part of the extended family of John and Sarah Parker.

== Massacre ==
Soon the settlers were making their homes and farming the land. Several had built cabins on their farms, and used the fort for protection. Peace treaties were made with surrounding Native American chiefs. Following the massacre of Anglos at the Alamo, the Comanche and other local tribes were emboldened to retake their lost lands. 

On May 19, 1836, a large party of Native Americans, including Comanches, Kiowas, Caddos, and Wichitas, attacked the inhabitants of Fort Parker. In her memoir, Rachel Plummer wrote that &quot;one minute the fields (in front of the fort) were clear, and the next moment, more Indians than I dreamed possible were in front of the fort.&quot;

One of the Indians approached the fort with a white flag. No one believed the flag was genuine. Silas Parker wanted the five men present to man the walls and fight as best they could. Benjamin Parker felt that by going out he could buy time for the majority of the women and children to flee out the back (small) gate. He felt that there was simply no way that five men would be able to hold the Indians out more than a second or two, as they could use ropes to scale the walls. He felt that the war party would then kill everyone in the fort, and the unsuspecting men in the fields. He argued with Silas that they had to barter their lives for time for everyone else. Their father agreed with Benjamin.

Benjamin knew he was going to be killed. According to Rachel Plummer&#x27;s account, Benjamin returned to the fort, after his first talk with the war party, and told his brother and father that he believed they would all be killed, and that they should run swiftly to the woods. Silas again argued with him, telling him they should push the big gate shut, and man the walls. Ben pointed out, rightly, Rachel said, that there was no time, and their &quot;course was decided.&quot; He told her, &quot;run little Rachel, for your life and your unborn child, run now and fast!&quot; She said he then straightened up and went back outside. She recounted how Silas told her to watch the front gate, after Benjamin had gone out to talk to the Indians the second time, when she herself wanted to flee, while he ran for his musket and powder pouch. &quot;They will kill Benjamin,&quot; she reported her Uncle Silas saying, &quot;and then me, but I will do for at least one of them, by God.&quot; At that moment, she said she heard whooping outside the fort, and then Indians were inside.

The 3–5 minutes bought enough time that the majority of the women and children did get away. Rachel Plummer, who was pregnant, was afraid she would not be able to keep up while carrying her two-year-old son, and so she stayed in the fort. She began running after seeing the Indians come into the fort, holding her little boy&#x27;s hand, while behind her she said she saw Indians stabbing Benjamin with their lances, and then she heard &quot;Uncle Silas shout defiance as though he had a thousand men with him. Alas, he was alone, and soon dead.&quot; Lucy Parker, who also had a small child, stopped to argue with her husband Silas, begging him to come with her. Elizabeth Duty Kellogg stopped to gather up their savings, $100 in coins, before she attempted to escape.

Benjamin Parker was killed, and before the fort&#x27;s gates could be closed, the raiders rushed inside. Silas Parker, who was outside with his brother, was killed before he was able to get back inside the gate. Samuel Frost and his son Robert were killed inside the gate, as they attempted to flee. John Parker was castrated and then scalped. His wife came out of the woods when she saw his torture and was captured. Lucy Parker and her youngest two children were initially captured but were rescued by David Faulkenberry as he ran up to the fort from the fields. Her two oldest children, however, along with Rachel and her son, and Elizabeth Kellogg were successfully kidnapped.

In all, five men were killed, some were left for dead, two women and three children were captured, and the rest escaped into the wilderness.

Their captivity took several years, except Mrs. Kellogg, who was ransomed within 3 months.

== Aftermath ==

=== Cynthia Ann Parker ===

One of the captives was a nine-year-old girl, Cynthia Ann Parker, daughter of Silas and Lucinda Duty Parker. Cynthia Ann lived with the Comanches for nearly 25 years. She married Comanche chief Peta Nocona and was the mother of three children, including Quanah Parker. In 1860, she was among a Native American party captured by Texas Rangers at the Battle of Pease River. Ironically, Cynthia Parker was the victim of two massacres which destroyed her life. The first, the attack on Fort Parker in 1836, killed her father and left her among the Comanche for nearly 25 years. The second, a massacre of the Comanche Band of her husband, the Noconis, at the Battle of Pease River left her a prisoner among the whites. She was identified by her uncle, Isaac Parker, and returned to his home in Texas. Cynthia Ann never readjusted to the Anglo society, and died at the age of 43 in 1870 after starving herself to death after her daughter, Prairie Flower, had caught influenza and died from pneumonia. She was originally buried in Poyner, Henderson County, Texas, but her son, Quanah, had her reburied next to his future grave at his home, the Star House, in Cache, Oklahoma. In 1957 the State of Oklahoma moved their graves to Old Post Cemetery in Fort Sill, Commanche County, Oklahoma, on what is known as Chief&#x27;s Knoll. In 1965 the state of Texas had Prairie Flower moved from her grave in Edom, Van Zandt County, Texas to join her mother and brother.

=== John Richard Parker ===
Cynthia Ann&#x27;s brother John Richard Parker was ransomed back in 1842 along with his cousin, James Pratt Plummer. He was unable to adapt to white society and ran back to the Comanche. He later was left to die after he contracted smallpox during a Comanche raid into Mexico. The war party left a captive Mexican girl to care for him, and he restored her to her family after recovering, and spent the remainder of his life in Old Mexico after marrying her. During the American Civil War, he served in a Mexican Company within the Confederate Army. He later lived as stockman and rancher in Mexico, where he died in 1915.

=== Rachel Plummer ===
Rachel Plummer, the 17-year-old wife of Luther Plummer, daughter of James Parker, and cousin to Cynthia Parker and her brother John, was held captive by the Comanche for two years before being ransomed by her father. Her book on her captivity, &quot;Rachael Plummer&#x27;s Narrative of Twenty-One Months&#x27; Servitude as a Prisoner Among the Comanchee Indians&quot;, was issued in Houston in 1838. This was the first narrative about a captive of Texas Indians published in the Republic of Texas, and it was a sensation not just there, but throughout the United States and even abroad. Rachel died in 1840, in childbirth, a year after being ransomed.

=== James Pratt Plummer ===

James Pratt, son of Luther Martin Thomas Plummer and Rachel Parker Plummer, was separated from his mother (who never knew about his further fate) and was soon given away to another Comanche band. Late in 1842 he was ransomed and in 1843 reunited with his grandfather James W. Parker. Parker refused to return his grandson to his father, claiming that Luther Plummer had not even paid any money for his family&#x27;s ransom. Even when the latter appealed successfully to the Governor of Texas, Parker refused to return his grandson. Luther Plummer later remarried and fathered another child, and then did not pursue the matter any further. James Pratt Plummer married twice and had four children. He enlisted in the Confederate Army during the Civil War and died from pneumonia in 1862 after suffering from typhoid.

=== Elizabeth Duty Kellogg ===
In late May 1836, Elizabeth Kellogg was taken by a band of Kichai Indians, which she took for &quot;Kitchawas&quot;. In summer, Delaware Indians purchased Mrs. Kellogg and sold her to her brother-in-law James W. Parker in August 1836 for 150 dollars (the money was sent by Sam Houston). She was reunited with her sister Martha Duty on September 6, 1836.

==People closely related to the fate of the captured inhabitants==
===James W. Parker===

James W. Parker, who was working in the fields when the raid began, spent much of the rest of his life, and most of his fortune, searching for his daughter Rachel, his grandson James, his niece Cynthia, and his nephew John Richard. After many near-death escapes, he finally settled with his family. John Wayne&#x27;s character Ethan Edwards, in the John Ford Western &quot;The Searchers&quot;, was modeled by author Alan Le May after Parker and others affected by child abductions.

Former &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; columnist Frank X. Tolbert in his book &quot;An Informal History of Texas&quot; entitled one of his book&#x27;s chapters &quot;Was Uncle James (Parker) The Villain&quot; which expressed an entirely different take on the reverend. James W. Parker was Cynthia Ann Parker&#x27;s uncle, Rachel Plummer&#x27;s father, and Rachel&#x27;s son James Pratt Plummer&#x27;s grandfather. Sam Houston responded to &quot;Luther&quot; Thomas Martin Plummer in a letter that: &quot;Reverend Parker had quite a bad reputation with most all he ever had business dealings.&quot; Houston did not trust the judgement of Parker and as that chapter of Tolbert&#x27;s book relates Houston just could not believe that Reverend Parker would not return James Pratt Plummer to his natural father.

===Quanah Parker===

Quanah Parker, son of Cynthia Ann Parker, became a leader among the Quahadi Comanches. After most of the Comanches and other tribes on the Staked Plains were defeated, Parker and his group surrendered to authorities and were forced to an Indian reservation in Oklahoma Territory. The Quahadis were the very last tribe left on the Staked Plains. Quanah Parker was made chief of all the Comanche tribes on the reservation. Shortly before his own death in 1911, he arranged for the disinterment of his mother and sister and had them reburied in a plot next to his own at the Post Oak Cemetery near Cache, Oklahoma. Congress passed a special allotment to fund the reburial. The three were moved in 1957 to the Old Post military cemetery in Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

<doc id="384829" wikidata="Q144218" url="?curid=384829" title="Coscoroba swan">
<text>The coscoroba swan (Coscoroba coscoroba) is a species of waterfowl in the subfamily Anserinae of the family Anatidae. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the Falkland Islands.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The coscoroba swan&#x27;s placement within the family Anatidae is not fully agreed upon, with a 2014 genetic study positing a phylogenetic relationship between this species and the Cape Barren goose (&quot;Cereopsis novaehollandiae&quot;). BirdLife International&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; has adopted this approach and places the coscoroba swan and Cape Barren goose together in the tribe Cereopsini, which it places as basal to &quot;Cygnus&quot; and all other geese. However, the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society, the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), and the Clements taxonomy treat the Cape Barren goose as basal to other geese, which themselves precede the coscoroba and other swans in a linear sequence. Even those three systems differ, with the IOC placing the coscoroba before &quot;Cygnus&quot; and the other two after it in their lists.

The coscoroba swan is the only member of the genus &quot;Coscoroba&quot; and has no subspecies.

==Description==

The coscoroba swan is a medium-large sized waterfowl, but smaller than the true swans, at long with a wingspan of about . Males weigh and females . Their appearance is considered to be slightly unusual, being intermediate between that of geese and true swans. They have completely feathered faces—unusual for true swans—and their feet are located directly under their bodies, enabling the coscoroba swan to walk more efficiently than the “waddling” of most waterfowl. Physically, coscoroba swans have been compared to the American Pekin duck, albeit larger and with darker, redder bills and feet (Pekin ducks have bright orange bills and feet). The sexes have the same plumage; upon hatching, the chicks have blue-grey bills and feet and black striping running down the length of their bodies (to aid in camouflage from predators), with this eventually fading by about eight months of age. The adults are completely white, except for black tips to the outer six primary feathers, though this black is often barely visible on the closed wing unless the bird is in flight.

==Distribution and habitat==

The coscoroba swan is a year-round resident of central Argentina and along the Uruguay-southern Brazil coast. It also breeds but does not winter from southern Chile and Argentina south to Tierra del Fuego and occasionally to the Falkland Islands. In winter its range extends north to central Chile, northern Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and southern Brazil. It has been recorded as a vagrant in Bolivia and at several locations in Brazil north of its usual limit. The coscoroba swan inhabits well-vegetated lagoons, freshwater swamps, and sometimes human-made reservoirs. It is mainly a bird of the lowlands, though there are scattered records as high as and at least one at .

==Behavior==
===Feeding===

The coscoroba swan&#x27;s diet has not been studied in detail, but it apparently feeds on aquatic and some terrestrial plants, small aquatic invertebrates, and small fish. It forages mainly while swimming or wading in shallow water and in contrast to other swans seldom upends. It also grazes on land. It often feeds with black-necked swans (&quot;Cygnus melanocoryphus&quot;).

===Breeding===

The coscoroba swan breeds in the local spring, which is May to October in northern Argentina, July to December in Chile, and July and August in southern Brazil. The species forms long-term pair bonds. Its nest is a mound of vegetation lined with soft grass constructed by both members of a pair on a small islet, partially floating in a reedbed or long grass close to water. The clutch size is four to nine oval eggs that weigh about with dimensions of about . Males guard females during the incubation period of about 35 days. Both parents care for the young through fledging at 14 weeks and beyond, sometimes until they are a year old. In captivity, coscoroba swans can live 20 years.

===Vocalization===

The coscoroba swan makes an onomatopoeic &quot;cos-cor-oo&quot;, usually as a threat to intruders. They also make a &quot;monosyllabic hooting note&quot; as a contact call between mates. Immature birds make &quot;loud chirps and trills&quot;.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the coscoroba swan as being of Least Concern. It has a large range and its estimated population of 6700 to 17,000 mature individuals is believed to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified. The species&#x27; population varies dramatically at different parts of its range, being fairly common in Argentina, uncommon in Paraguay and Uruguay, rare in Chile, and uncertain in Brazil. The &quot;[g]reatest threat seems to be loss of temperate marsh habitats due to urbanization and agricultural developments&quot;.

<text>Herbert Baxter Adams (April 16, 1850 – July 30, 1901) was an American educator and historian who brought German rigor to the study of history and social science in America. He was a professor at Johns Hopkins University.

He was a founding member of the American Historical Association, and one of the earliest educators using the seminar for teaching history. With a fresh PhD from the Heidelberg University in Germany, Johns Hopkins University brought Adams in as a teaching fellow in history during their inaugural year. Adams stayed with Johns Hopkins until his health failed.

Adams was instrumental in organizing the American Historical Association. A leading organizer of American graduate schools, he contributed to various reform efforts. He has been characterized as a His legacy is honored through various awards and professorships at Johns Hopkins University.

==Early life==
Adams was born to lumber merchant Nathaniel Dickinson Adams and Harriet (Hastings) Adams in Shutesbury, Massachusetts, on April 16, 1850.

On his mother&#x27;s side, he was a descendant of Thomas Hastings who came from the East Anglia region of England to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634.

Herbert B. Adams received his early training in the Amherst, Massachusetts public schools followed by Phillips Exeter Academy. He graduated from Amherst College, with an AB in 1872 and AM in 1875.

In 1873 Adams traveled to Europe to study and write. In 1874 he moved to Heidelberg, Germany, to pursue, two years later, the PhD degree in political science. There he was influenced by Johann Gustav Droysen and Johann Kaspar Bluntschli, the latter also becoming his mentor. Heidelberg did not then require a thesis from its doctoral candidates, instead it required an oral examination, for which he chose political science for his major field (Hauptfach), with two minors (Nebenfächer) in public and international law and in political and cultural history. Adams passed the oral examination on July 13, 1876, summa cum laude.

==Career==
The new Johns Hopkins University, which opened in 1876, wanted to bring German-style graduate education to the United States. Adams was hired as fellow in history from 1876 to 1878, associate from 1878 to 1883, and was appointed associate professor in 1883. He is credited with bringing the study of history into the realm of the social sciences: &quot;Adams, with his German training, was determined to inaugurate through the seminar system the scientific study of history based on careful, critical examination of the sources. He hoped to make the study of history an independent professional pursuit rather than a mere branch of literature.&quot;

From 1878 to 1881 Adams was also a lecturer in history at Smith College. He was then a member of the New England Historic Genealogical Society, from 1881 to 1886.

At Johns Hopkins, in 1880, Adams began his famous seminar in history, where a large proportion of the next generation of American historians trained. Among his students were Woodrow Wilson, Thomas Dixon, Jr., John Dewey, and Charles McLean Andrews. In 1882 Adams founded the &quot;Johns Hopkins Studies in Historical and Political Science,&quot; the first such series. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1881. He brought about the organization in 1884 of the American Historical Association, for which he was secretary until 1900, when he resigned and was made first vice president. His historical writings introduced scientific methods of investigation that influenced many historians, including Frederick Jackson Turner and John Spencer Bassett. He authored &quot;Life and Writings of Jared Sparks&quot; (2 vols., 1893) and many articles and influential reports on the study of the social sciences.

His principal writings are:
*&quot;The Germanic Origin of the New England Towns&quot;
*&quot;Saxon Tithing-Men in America&quot;
*&quot;Norman Constables in America&quot;
* &quot;Village Communities&quot;
*&quot;Methods of Historical Study&quot; and,
*&quot;Maryland&#x27;s Influence upon Land Cessions to the United States&quot; 

All these papers are published in the &quot;Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science,&quot; edited by Prof. Adams, 4 vols. (Baltimore, 1883–1986). Although less known for his contributions to the history of education, Adams was essential to its early development. He edited the circular series titled, &quot;Contributions to American Educational History&quot; which was printed and distributed by the U.S. Bureau of Education.

A new class of experts needed new modes of training, and those were provided by the new American graduate schools, built along German models. Adams was a leading organizer. He was a Mugwump who promoted reform at Johns Hopkins and nationally. Under his direction, the faculty and advanced students worked for numerous reforms, including civil service reform in the Pendleton Act (1883), municipal reform with the New Charter of Baltimore (1895), the training of professional social workers, and efforts to solve labor unrest. Raymond Cunningham, argues that his reformism shows that the Mugwumps movement could attract affirmative and optimistic experts, rather than just suspicious or cautious patricians.

==Last years==
Adams was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1886. He received the degree LL.D. from the University of Alabama in 1891, and from Amherst in 1899.

Adams made a report to the U.S. Bureau of Education on summer schools in Europe in 1896, and resigned the chair of American and institutional history at Johns Hopkins University in December, 1900, to take effect in February, 1901, and then visited Florida.

Returning to his home in Amherst, Massachusetts, Adams died on July 30, 1901, and was buried next to his parents and older brother in Wildwood Cemetery.

==Honors==
*Adams House, an undergraduate dormitory at Johns Hopkins University, is named for him.
*The American Historical Association&#x27;s Herbert Baxter Adams prize was named for him.
*The Herbert Baxter Adams Professorship at Johns Hopkins University was created in his honor.

<text>The Guelph Gryphons are the athletic teams that represent the University of Guelph in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The university&#x27;s varsity teams compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference of the U Sports (OUA&#x27;s), and, where applicable, in the west division. The university teams are often referred to as the Gryphs, which is short for the school&#x27;s mascot, Gryph, the gryphon.

==Varsity teams==

Guelph Gryphons teams compete in:
* Baseball (m)
* Basketball (m/w)

==Baseball==
Established in 1998, the baseball team is not one of the school&#x27;s most well known programs. Although the team does produce a varsity team, it does not receive the same recognition as the football, or even basketball teams. Much like football, the team has an early season starting from the first week of September for a month straight until October. Since it is a short schedule of 21 games and only one month for play, the league often schedules two games per day. University baseball in the OUA is growing and currently eight universities compete, four of which qualify for the playoffs and championship. However, unlike many varsity sports the baseball team does not compete in the CIS. The team does, however, try to compete in the CIBA (Canadian Intercollegiate Baseball Association). In 2012, the Gryphons baseball team established a new team wins record by obtaining 14 wins in regular season play. The Gryphons finished second in the OUA standings and it meant that the team would advance to the OUA playoffs for the first time since 2004. In the playoffs, the Gryphons started strong by defeating Western before dropping the next to Toronto in a nail biter for a chance at a place in the final. The team would lose the semi-final to Brock to close out the season in third place.

==Men&#x27;s basketball==
Garney Henley took over as head coach for the Basketball team in the 1965–66 season taking it from an intramural program to a varsity contender. In the 1973–74 season, the team entered the CIAU National Basketball championship as a wild card team. The team won the National Basketball Game for the first time in the school&#x27;s history beating St. Mary&#x27;s University with the final score of 74–72.

The team competes in the OUA West division along with the university&#x27;s longtime rival, the University of Western Ontario. The team plays its games from October to February of the following year. Generally, the team is hand-picked by scouts from various high schools trying to fill a 16-man roster. However, tryouts may be held at the beginning of the school year for the last spot on the team. Pre-season practices, workouts, and tryouts often happen prior to the start of the season, which is held in late October. During the off-season, the team competes in various exhibition games and tournaments against college teams in Ontario, and sometimes teams from the National Collegiate Athletic Association.

==Women&#x27;s basketball==
The women&#x27;s basketball team was established in 1971 (or earlier) and competes in the Ontario University Athletics (OUA) west division. The team&#x27;s season runs from November to February, playing over thirty games within this period.

==Field hockey==
The women&#x27;s field hockey team was established in 1979. There are nine teams that compete in this sport and only one division exists. The team plays from September to November. 25 games are played within this time, and only fourteen of these games are officially recorded by the OUA.

==Men&#x27;s ice hockey==
The men&#x27;s ice hockey team dates back to the early days of collegiate hockey in North America. The team was originally known as the &quot;Ontario Agricultural College&quot; hockey team. As the OAC, the team competed as early as the 1899–00 Ontario Hockey Association Intermediate season and transitioned to the University of Guelph Gryphons while sitting out the 1963–64 season. The Gryphons won the University Cup in 1997, emblematic of Canadian scholastic hockey supremacy. The Gryphons have also won league titles in 1976, 1979, 1980, 1994, 1997 and 2015.

==Women&#x27;s ice hockey==

The women&#x27;s ice hockey team was established in 1979. There are currently 11 teams that compete in the OUA and thus only one division exists. The team plays from September to February. 26 OUA games are played within this time, with several exhibition games played before and sometimes during the regular season. In the 2016–17 season, the Gryphons repeated as OUA champions, with a convincing 6–1 win on home ice over the Nipissing Lakers, to lift the McCaw Cup.

==Football==

The Guelph Gryphons football team has been in competition since 1950 and is considered to be the biggest sport at the university. The football team has a nine-week schedule which starts in late August to the last week of October, followed by the OUA playoffs which run within the first three weeks of November. Unlike other sports, there are only 11 schools that compete in OUA football, so there is only one division. The team usually has 60 to 80 varsity athletes however, not all will have the opportunity to play for the team. The recruitment process is very similar to other major sports at the University of Guelph. Players are generally hand-picked by coaches and scouts while they play for their respective high school teams.

==Men&#x27;s lacrosse==
The University of Guelph&#x27;s men&#x27;s lacrosse team participates in the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association (CUFLA). They have won the championship, known as the Baggataway Cup, five times - in 1995, 2000, 2008, 2013 and 2014.

The Baggataway Cup is not affiliated with the OUA.

==Women&#x27;s lacrosse==
In 1997, the University of Guelph put together their first women&#x27;s lacrosse team. The lacrosse team competes from September to November. Within this time the team plays fifteen games, with only twelve of these recorded by the OUA.

==Women&#x27;s rugby==
The women&#x27;s rugby team formed in 1994. The team competes in the Ontario University Athletics (OUA) Shiels division. The team&#x27;s season spans from September to November. The team plays twelve games each season, but only five are recorded in the OUA standings. The Gryphons women&#x27;s rugby team finished the 2008-2009 year with a perfect 5–0 record.
The Guelph Gryphons have been working towards a National Gold medal for the past four years earning Bronze at the CIS championships between 2007 and 2010. Finally finishing their 2011–2012 season with Gold, they returned from the national University 7&#x27;s tournament in BC receiving their second Gold for the 2011–2012 season.

==Men&#x27;s soccer==
The men&#x27;s soccer team started in 1979. The current team consists of a total of 23 players, one coach, four assistants, two trainers, one manager, and one sports informer. The season has 14 games from September to October, with the post-season lasting through November. The OUA has 17 participating schools around Ontario. In 1990, the Gryphons won their first OUA title defeating the Toronto Varsity Blues 1–0 in the championship game at Alumni Stadium. After defeating Mount Allison in the CIAU Semis, the Gryphons met the defending champion, UBC Thunderbirds, in the CIAU final but dropped a 2–1 decision before a record crowd at home.

In the 2016–17 season, the Guelph Gryphons Men&#x27;s Soccer team were crowned OUA champions in a 3–1 win over the rival York Lions. This represents their first OUA title since 1990.

==Men&#x27;s volleyball==
The men&#x27;s volleyball team at the University of Guelph had its first year of in the OUA in 1979. The 2010 team consists of 18 men from all around Canada, one coach, four assistants, one trainer, and one sports informer. The team&#x27;s season consists of 20 games and runs from October to February while playoffs last until the end of February. The OUA currently contains 11 competing teams from universities all over Ontario. Some highlights throughout the years has been in 2003–04 where the Gryphons finished with a 13–5 record for 2nd place and were ranked as high as 8th in the CIS. This marked their best finish since 1982–83 when Guelph finished second in the OUA West Division. The Gryphs won their semi-final series against Western in two straight matches but later lost to the Toronto Varsity Blues. In the 2016–17 season, the Guelph Gryphons achieved a bronze medal.

<text>Aurel Vlaicu (; 19 November 1882 – 13 September 1913) was a Romanian engineer, inventor, airplane constructor, and early pilot.

==Early years and education==

Aurel Vlaicu was born in the village of Binținți in Transylvania, Austria-Hungary. In 1925, by then part of Romania, it was renamed &quot;Aurel Vlaicu&quot;, and is now part of Geoagiu town. He attended a Calvinist high school in Orăștie (renamed Aurel Vlaicu High School in his honor in 1919) and took his baccalaureate in Sibiu in 1902. He was a high school colleague of Petru Groza, and in Sibiu became friends with Octavian Goga. Vlaicu furthered his studies at Technical University of Budapest and Technische Hochschule München in Germany, earning his engineer&#x27;s diploma in 1907.

Between 1907 and 1908 Vlaicu served in the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and on September 1, 1908, he took an engineer&#x27;s position with the Opel car factory in Rüsselsheim.

==Aviation career==


Vlaicu left Opel in March 1909 and returned to Binţinţi, where, together with his brother, Ion, he built a glider which first flew in the summer of 1909.
In October 1909, on the advice of Octavian Goga, he moved to the Kingdom of Romania, where with help from Romanian-Transylvanian expatriates, he obtained financial support to build his first powered airplane, following a number of demonstration flights with rubber-powered models in front of Romanian government officials and journalists.

On November 1, 1909, he began the construction of his first powered airplane, the &quot;A. Vlaicu Nr. I&quot; at the Army Arsenal in Bucharest with funding from the Romanian Ministry of War and on a 300 lei monthly stipend from the Minister of Public Education. &quot;A. Vlaicu Nr. I&quot; flew for the first time on June 17, 1910, over Cotroceni airfield.

On September 28, 1910, as a part of the fall military exercises, Vlaicu flew his airplane from Slatina to Piatra Olt carrying a message, an early instance of an airplane being used for military purposes.

The construction of &quot;A. Vlaicu Nr. II&quot; was started in December 1910 on a budget of 16,000 lei and first flew in April 1911. Between 23 and 30 June 1912 Vlaicu competed with it at the International Flight Week in Aspern-Vienna (Die internationale Flugwoche in Wien), against 42 other aviators, including Roland Garros. Vlaicu won prizes totaling 7,500 Austro-Hungarian krone for precision landing, projectile throwing and tight flying around a pole. On this occasion, he was issued the FAI pilot license number 52. On return from Aspern he flew demonstration flights throughout Transylvania.

&quot;A. Vlaicu Nr. III&quot; was a two-seat monoplane having a fully cowled Gnome Gamma engine. Built on contract for the Marconi Company for experiments with aerial radio, at the time of Vlaicu&#x27;s death it was only partially finished. It was completed by his friends and several short test flights were made during 1914 by military pilot Petre Macavei. Further tests were hindered by the unusual controls. In 1916, during the German occupation of Bucharest, the aircraft was seized and shipped to Germany, and it was last seen in 1942 at an aviation exhibition in Berlin by Romanian military officers, though no mention of it is made in references on the Berlin exhibition.

==Vlaicu airplanes design==

During his short career, Aurel Vlaicu designed and built one glider and three airplanes of his own design.

He perfected his design on rubber band powered models he began experimenting with while a student in Munich.

Vlaicu&#x27;s three powered airplanes had one central aluminium tubing, the flight controls in front, two counter-rotating propellers, one mounted ahead of the nacelle, and the other to the rear of the wing up high, partially counteracting each other&#x27;s torque. They employ tricycle-landing gears with independent trailing arm suspension, had brakes on the rear wheel, and were equipped with Gnome rotary engines.

His airplanes lacked ailerons, relying on just rudder and elevators for control, via a steering wheel mounted on a tiller. The wheel controlled the elevators while sideways motion of the tiller controlled the rudder. The wheel could be temporarily locked with the help of two dowels. The low center of gravity provided by the parasol wing allowed for the lateral stability that this type of control system requires.

==Death==

Aurel Vlaicu died on September 13, 1913, near Câmpina, on the outskirts of Bănești commune crashing his now aged &quot;A. Vlaicu Nr. II&quot; while attempting to be the first to fly across the Carpathian Mountains. He was expected to participate in the ASTRA festivities in Orăștie, near Binținți.

He was buried on September 17, 1913, in Bellu Cemetery, in Bucharest. At his funeral he was awarded the Military Virtue Medal. In 1948, he was posthumously elected to the Romanian Academy.

The cause of Vlaicu&#x27;s crash remains unknown. Vlaicu&#x27;s friends Giovanni Magnani and Constantin Silisteanu dismissed claims of sabotage, the two being among the first to inspect the wreckage as they were following him in an automobile. The most plausible cause of Vlaicu&#x27;s death was that the airplane stalled while landing with the engine off (as it was common practice at the time, landings were made with the engine off, however this made it difficult for the pilot to abort a misjudged landing). 

==Legacy==

17 June, the day of Aurel Vlaicu&#x27;s first powered flight, is celebrated as The National Aviation Day of Romania.

His name is listed second on the Romanian Airmen Heroes Memorial in Bucharest, after Gheorghe Caranda and before his friend and fellow pilot, Gheorghe Negel, who died in an aircraft crash one month after Vlaicu, on October 11, 1913.

A museum was established in his home village, now named Aurel Vlaicu. and a monument was erected near Bănești where he crashed his plane.

The second largest airport in Romania, a TAROM Airbus A318-111 and the Aurel Vlaicu University, a public university founded in 1991 in Arad are all named after him.

The 50 Romanian lei banknote has a portrait of Vlaicu on the obverse, and on the reverse a drawing of one of his airplanes and a cross-section of the airplane&#x27;s engine.

A commemorative 50 bani coin was issued by the Romanian National Bank in 2010.

A Bucharest Metro train station, Aurel Vlaicu metro station is named in memory of him.

His life was the subject of the novels &quot;Maistorașul Aurel, ucenicul lui Dumnezeu: Cronica vremii și vieții lui Vlaicu&quot; by Victor Ion Popa (published in 1939) and &quot;Flăcăul din Binținți&quot; by Constantin Ghiban (published in 1953), and of a movie by Mircea Drăgan (released in 1978).

In 2010 a museum in Deva ordered several hundreds mugs to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Vlaicu&#x27;s first powered flight. The mug designers used a pictured uploaded to Wikipedia showing another Romanian aviation pioneer, Traian Vuia, which was wrongly labelled as Aurel Vlaicu (Wikipedia upload picture name &quot;Aurel Vlaicu avionul&quot;). As of May 2018, the incorrect picture is still used on several websites.

<text>Henri Léon Emile Lavedan (9 April 1859 – 4 September 1940), French dramatist and man of letters, was born at Orléans, the son of , a well-known Catholic and liberal journalist.

Lavedan contributed to various Parisian papers a series of witty tales and dialogues of Parisian life, many of which were collected in volume form. In 1891 he produced at the Théâtre Français &quot;Une Famille&quot;, followed at the Vaudeville in 1894 by &quot;Le Prince d&#x27;Aurec&quot;, a satire on the nobility, afterward renamed &quot;Les Descendants&quot;.

He had a great success with &quot;Le Duel&quot; (Comédie-Française 1905), a powerful psychological study of the relations of two brothers, which was turned into a movie—&quot;The Duel&quot;—on which he was a co-writer. It was translated into English by Louis N. Parker and performed in New York in 1906 at the Hudson Theatre.

Lavedan was admitted to the Académie française in 1898.

<text>The Alberta Golden Bears and Pandas are the sports teams that represent the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Alberta athletics teams have won a total of 101 national championships, including 84 in U Sports sanctioned sports, making it one of the most successful programs in the country.

== History ==
The University of Alberta has featured varsity teams since the school&#x27;s inception in 1908, notably with the men&#x27;s ice hockey team first playing a season of six games during that school year. The school&#x27;s colours of evergreen and gold were approved as the varsity teams&#x27; official colours on October 13, 1908. The football team adopted the name &quot;Golden Bears&quot; for the 1935 season with the men&#x27;s basketball team following suit in 1936 and all other male varsity programs soon after. After World War II ended and teams resumed play, the women&#x27;s varsity teams first began playing under the &quot;Pandas&quot; moniker which was adopted by all of the school&#x27;s women&#x27;s teams.

Currently, Alberta&#x27;s athletics program fields 24 teams in 14 different sports administered by U Sports in the Canada West conference. The football and soccer teams play their home games at Foote Field, and the basketball and volleyball teams&#x27; home is the Saville Community Sports Centre. The ice hockey teams play at Clare Drake Arena, named after long-time coach Clare Drake. Professor W. G. Hardy coached the men&#x27;s team from 1922 to 1926, and played a leading role in getting the first ice hockey rink built at the university campus in 1927.

== Varsity teams ==
=== Golden Bears football ===

The Golden Bears football program has been in competition since 1910. The Golden Bears have won three Vanier Cup national championships, in 1967, 1972 and most recently in 1980. The program has also won 16 Hardy Cup conference titles, which is the third most championships won in the conference. The program has also had three players win the Hec Crighton Trophy, with Mel Smith winning in 1971, Bryan Fryer winning in 1975, and most recently Ed Ilnicki winning the award in 2017.
=== Golden Bears ice hockey ===

The U Sports men&#x27;s ice hockey program has been competing since 1908, in the same year that the University of Alberta was first established. The Golden Bears have won the most David Johnston University Cup championships with 16 wins, most recently in 2018. The program has also featured 55 conference championship teams, including a recent period of domination where Golden Bear teams have won 16 out of 20 Canada West championships from 2000 to 2020. The team&#x27;s head coach, Ian Herbers, returned to the team in 2018 following a stint with the Edmonton Oilers after previously being the team&#x27;s head coach for three seasons from 2012 to 2015.
=== Pandas ice hockey ===

The University of Alberta has featured a women&#x27;s ice hockey program since at least 1913, near the beginning years of the school&#x27;s creation in 1908. Since U Sports women&#x27;s ice hockey became a nationally sanctioned sport in 1997, the Pandas have been the most prolific program in the country with eight national championships won, with the most recent victory occurring in 2017. The program has also been dominant in Canada West play as Panda teams have won 14 conference championships, including seven in a row from 2001 to 2008. The team has been led by head coach Howie Draper since the inaugural season in 1997–98.

=== Golden Bears volleyball ===
The Golden Bears men&#x27;s volleyball first began intercollegiate play in the 1955–56 season and has competed in the Canada West conference since the 1971–72 season. The Golden Bears first won a U Sports men&#x27;s volleyball championship in 1981 and have won nine national championships in total, including the most recent in 2024, which is tied for the most out of all of the U Sports men&#x27;s volleyball programs. The program has also featured 17 Canada West conference champions, most recently in 2024. Golden Bears players have won the U Sports Men&#x27;s Volleyball Player of the Year award 11 times, the most in the country, with Terry Danyluk winning the first two.

=== Pandas volleyball ===
The Pandas women&#x27;s volleyball program first began in the 1950s where the team won their first Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union championship in 1953. The Pandas first qualified for the U Sports women&#x27;s volleyball championship tournament in 1993 under the direction of then-second year head coach Laurie Eisler and soon won the first national championship in team history in 1995. The Pandas then repeated as champions five times to tie the U Sports women&#x27;s volleyball record with six consecutive national championships won. The team won their seventh and most recent national championship in 2007, with their seven wins second only to the UBC Thunderbirds. The Pandas have also won 18 conference titles with their most recent occurring in 2017. Eisler continues to serve as the team&#x27;s head coach and has won the Marilyn Pomfret Award as the U Sports Coach of the Year three times. Five Pandas players have won the Mary Lyons Award with Miroslava Pribylova winning in 1996 and 1997, Jenny Cartmell winning in 1999 and 2000, Tiffany Dodds winning in 2007, Meg Casault winning in 2017, and Kory White winning most recently in 2022.

=== Pandas rugby ===
The Pandas women&#x27;s rugby program began in the 1970s and had significant successes between 1999 and 2006.
Matt Parrish is the current Head Coach.

== Golden Bears awards and standings ==
The Golden Bears are considered a strong school team in Canada in multiple sports. The hockey and volleyball teams, in particular, are frequent challengers in U Sports national championships.

In addition to their success over Canadian competition, the Golden Bears host the annual Husky Energy Can-Am Challenge of Champions tournament, where they frequently spearhead the Canadian contingent&#x27;s success. This tournament sees four top teams from both Canada and the USA competing for supremacy, with the Canadian teams holding the overall title, having won 9 of the 13 tournaments.

<doc id="384844" wikidata="Q310288" url="?curid=384844" title="Bjarne Riis">
<text>Bjarne Lykkegård Riis (; born 3 April 1964), nicknamed &quot;The Eagle from Herning&quot; (), is a Danish former professional road bicycle racer who won the 1996 Tour de France. For many years he was the owner and later manager of the Oleg Tinkov associated Russian UCI WorldTeam . Other career highlights include placing first in the Amstel Gold Race in 1997, multiple Danish National Championships, and stage wins in the Giro d&#x27;Italia. On 25 May 2007, he admitted that he placed first in the Tour de France using banned substances, and he was no longer considered the winner by the Tour&#x27;s organizers. In July 2008, the Tour reconfirmed his victory but with an asterisk label to indicate his doping offences.

==Career==
Born in Herning, Riis began cycling at local club Herning CK. When he was not selected for the 1984 Summer Olympics, former cyclist Kim Andersen advised Riis to start his professional career not in Italy, but in Luxembourg. His professional career started in 1986, his first result was a fifth-place finish in the GP Wallonie that year. Following a few years with no personal wins, he had yet to impress when his contract ran out in 1988.

At the 1988 Tour of European Community race, while riding for the Toshiba team, Riis and fellow Danish rider Kim Eriksen were contacted by the former Tour de France winner Laurent Fignon from the Système U team. Fignon was leading the Tour of European Community race, but he needed a few riders to help him secure the victory. In the hope of earning a contract with Système U, Riis helped Fignon achieve the victory and in December 1988 he moved to sports director Cyrille Guimard&#x27;s Système U team as a support rider for Fignon. For the next three years Riis rode as Fignon&#x27;s eternal helper in both flat and mountainous terrain, and they became close friends. Riis helped Fignon win the 1989 Giro d&#x27;Italia, while Riis himself won his first professional victory as he secured the 9th stage of the Giro.

===Tour de France success===
When Fignon left Guimard in 1992, Bjarne Riis contacted fellow Danish rider Rolf Sørensen, who got him a job as a rider for Italian team Ariostea under sporting director Giancarlo Ferretti. Riis won stage 7 of the 1993 Tour de France and also wore the polka dot jersey as leader of the mountains classification for a day. He finished 5th place overall, which was the best Danish result in Tour history at the time, bettering former World Champion Leif Mortensen&#x27;s 6th-place finish in the 1971 Tour de France. Riis was ill during the 1994 Tour de France but went on a break-away and then racing solo for the last 30 km of the day. With the sprinter teams chasing him, he placed first on the stage by just a few seconds. Riis finished 3rd at the 1995 Tour de France, the first Dane to reach the podium in Paris.

For the 1996 season, Riis was brought on to the Telekom team as team captain. Following his excellent showing in the high climbs of the 1995 Tour, Riis was confident that he was capable of winning. He asked his new teammates to support him, and convinced them that if they worked for him he could bring the yellow jersey to Team Telekom. By the start of the Tour he was in superb condition, winning the Danish Road Racing Championship the week before the prologue. As a result of snow on both the Col de l&#x27;Iseran and the Col du Galibier, the scheduled 190 km stage 9 from Val-d&#x27;Isère to Sestriere in Italy was truncated and reduced to a 46 km sprint from Le-Monetier-les-Bains which was claimed by Riis, opening a 44-second gap over his teammate Jan Ullrich. By the Tour&#x27;s end Riis had placed first in the General classification, with a lead of 1:41 over his young teammate Ullrich. In so doing he ended the string of five successive victories won by Tour great Miguel Indurain. The win by Riis was instrumental in turning Telekom from a second tier cycling team which struggled just to be invited into the 1995 Tour, into one of the biggest teams in road racing. It also had a huge positive effect on the development of cycling in both Denmark and Germany, massively increasing spectator interest and participation in the sport as well.

In 1997, he placed first in the spring classic Amstel Gold Race, with a great effort, riding solo from a long way out, in pouring rain. Bjarne Riis was the favourite at the 1997 Tour de France, but instead it was his young German teammate Jan Ullrich, who won the overall competition, with Riis finishing 7th. On his way to the startup at stage 2 of the 1999 Tour de Suisse, Bjarne Riis hit the curb and crashed. The sustained injuries to his elbow and knee ultimately forced him to retire in the spring of 2000 at the age of 36.

===Doping allegations===

In the aftermath of the performance-enhancing drugs crisis in cycling following the 1998 Tour de France, Riis acquired the nickname of Mr. 60%, a suggestion that he has used doping. The 60% is an allusion to a high hematocrit (red blood cell) level, an indication of EPO usage. It has been published, but never proven, that Riis had a hematocrit level of 56% during one test in July 1995; well above typical natural levels, as well as his published reading of 41% in the offseason earlier that year. The earliest mention of the nickname can be traced to interviews with riders of Festina in 1998–2000, who apparently suggested that if they had been doped above 50%, then Riis must have been doped to at least 60%, since he was able to win the Tour de France in 1996 ahead of the Festina rider Richard Virenque: in Willy Voet&#x27;s book Breaking the Chain, he mentions that Festina&#x27;s team doctor would not allow EPO to be administered if a rider&#x27;s hematocrit level was near 55%.
Bjarne Riis never tested positive as a rider, though no EPO test existed at that time. Reports have noted, however, that police in Italy found evidence that Riis may have been among riders treated with EPO in 1994 and 1995 by medical researchers under Professor Francesco Conconi at the University of Ferrara, which resulted in prosecutions against Conconi and also involved Michele Ferrari. Files used in the court case apparently showed fluctuations in Riis&#x27; hematocrit from 41% to 56.3%.

Speculations about Bjarne Riis&#x27;s doping use was further fuelled by his ambiguous denials. When asked whether he used doping he repeatedly stated that &quot;I have never tested positive,&quot; a statement that falls short of an outright denial.

====Admission====

At the end of April 2007, former Riis&#x27; soigneur Jeff d&#x27;Hont wrote a book about the doping practices of Riis and other riders during his time in the cycling business.
On 21 May 2007, Riis&#x27; former Telekom teammate Bert Dietz admitted that he had used doping during his Telekom-time. This prompted other former teammates, Christian Henn and Udo Bölts, and two former team doctors, to admit their involvement in doping. On 24 May, three other teammates Rolf Aldag, Erik Zabel and Brian Holm confessed.

Following this series of confessions, on 25 May 2007 Riis issued a press release that he also had made &quot;mistakes&quot; in the past, and in the following press conference confessed to taking EPO, growth hormone and cortisone for 6 years, from 1993 to 1998, including during his victory in the 1996 Tour de France.
Riis said that he bought and injected the EPO himself, and team coach Walter Godefroot turned a blind eye to the drug use on the team. He denied a passage of Jeff d&#x27;Hont&#x27;s book, where it is related that his hematocrit level was once tested by the team and registered 64%. He said if someone wanted to take his yellow jersey they could do so, it meant nothing to him. Riis was removed from the official record books of Tour de France, but in July 2008 he was written back into the books, along with additional notes about his use of doping.

The reactions on Riis&#x27;s admission have been mixed. Some critics have called him a cheater, and that the results he achieved in his career were worthless. Others have labelled him as a victim of the doping culture that was rampant in professional road cycling, and have insisted that he should not be scapegoated for a wider problem.

In November 2010 Riis published a book about his career as a rider, emphasizing that doping throughout the time he had competed was not considered by the peloton as &quot;cheat&quot;, but simply as a part of the &quot;normal preparation&quot; for a professional rider. He described he had started to dope only with corticosteroids in the 80s, and then as he previously had confessed upgraded his doping with EPO in 1993–98. Riis states the last time he doped as a rider was in July 1998. He states he quit during the 1998 Tour de France when he was nearly caught by the police. As part of the probe into the Festina doping scandal, police were on their way to search the rooms of his Telekom teammates. Riis offered the following comment on the episode: “In my room I didn’t have a choice. My vials of doping products had to disappear quickly. In just a few minutes I gathered all my doses of EPO and threw them down the toilet”.

===Team manager===

Following his retirement, a new life opened up. Bjarne Riis had from the start been one of the people behind Danish cycling team , which became the first Danish team competing in the Tour de France. Following doping allegations and suspension of Home-Jack &amp; Jones rider Marc Streel in 1999, Home withdrew its sponsorship. Bjarne Riis bought the majority of the team through its controlling company &quot;Professional Cycling Denmark&quot; (PCD), and he became the team manager. In 2001, the team changed sponsor to CSC/World Online, then CSC/Tiscali, and in the seasons 2003 to 2007 the American IT company CSC was the sole sponsor of Team CSC. In season 2008 CSC shared the sponsorship with the Danish bank Saxo Bank which as of season 2009 has been the sole team sponsor. The team later got the name Team Saxo Bank Sungard and is now known as Team Saxo Bank-Tinkoff Bank. Riis renamed PCD to &quot;Riis Cycling A/S&quot; in 2003. Before the 2005 season, Team CSC had financial problems and some of the riders were asked to take a wage cut. Riis used his own money to keep the team running throughout his first years as team manager, an expenditure he later vowed never to repeat when a new sponsor deal was signed during the 2005 Tour de France.

As a team manager, his team has been involved in some doping cases, with no rider being convicted for using doping while on his team. However, in Tyler Hamilton&#x27;s book, &quot;The Secret Race,&quot; is described how Riis actively encouraged the use of doping on the CSC team. Also, Ivan Basso, who was Team CSC&#x27;s 2006 Tour de France general classification contender was removed from the team prior to the beginning of the Tour according to the UCI ProTour rules due to his possible involvement in the Operación Puerto doping case, an involvement confirmed by Basso himself in April 2007. Basso&#x27;s contract with Team CSC has since ended.

The story of team CSC during the 2004 Tour de France has been captured in a documentary titled &quot;Overcoming&quot;.

His best results as a manager in Grand Tours were winning the 2006 Giro d&#x27;Italia with Ivan Basso, the 2008 and 2010 Tour de France with Carlos Sastre and Andy Schleck respectively, and the 2012 Vuelta a España with Alberto Contador.

In December 2013 it was confirmed that team sponsor Oleg Tinkov had bought the team from Riis, for a reported sum of approximately €6 million, with Riis continuing as team manager on a three-year deal worth €1 million per year. Tinkov had previously criticised Riis and Contador for their performances during 2013 via social media.

In March 2015 the team confirmed that Riis had been removed from active duty due to differences between Riis and Tinkov. Media reports had initially indicated that Riis had been suspended when he did not appear at the 2015 Milan–San Remo as planned, and that this was due to a disappointing start to the season for the team. On 29 March, it was announced that Riis had been released by the team. News reports cited the &quot;tumultuous relationship&quot; and &quot;difference in character&quot; between Riis and Tinkov as the reason for Riis&#x27;s departure.

In July 2016 Riis and former Saxo Bank CEO Lars Seier announced that they had taken over the Danish UCI Continental team and renamed it , with the intention of it functioning as the development team for a planned UCI WorldTeam.

In January 2020 Riis was appointed as manager of the NTT Pro Cycling team.

<doc id="384847" wikidata="Q6802318" url="?curid=384847" title="McMaster Marauders">
<text>The McMaster Marauders are the athletic teams that represent McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Athletics at McMaster is currently managed by the university&#x27;s student affairs, under their athletics &amp; recreation department. The university&#x27;s 39 varsity teams compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference of U SPORTS. The Marauder&#x27;s official colours are maroon and grey.

While technically not considered a varsity team, McMaster has a university ringette team which competes annually in the Canadian national University Challenge Cup.

==History==
Soccer was the university&#x27;s first major sport. In 1889, a group of alumni from the Toronto Baptist College and Woodstock College played an exhibition game against one another, sparking an early intercity rivalry (when McMaster University was based in Toronto). A full-fledged hockey club was later organized during the winter of 1896–1897. In 1897, the university had made all athletics, physical activity and sports under the jurisdiction of a central executive committee.

In 1906, McMaster University, along with the University of Ottawa, Royal Military College and University of Trinity College had joined the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (CIAU), the first formal organization of intercollegiate athletics in Canada and the forerunner of the present day Canadian Interuniversity Sport. The varsity teams have been known as the McMaster Marauders since 1948. The name, the Marauders had been credited to Bill Cline, who on 26 November 1948, had his suggestion for the nickname of the university&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team published on the school&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;The Silhouette&quot;.

==Facilities==
The Marauders currently use the sports facilities located in the northeast corner of the main campus of McMaster. The university has a number of sports facilities including the Ron Joyce Stadium for football, the Ivor Wynne Centre for indoor sports, and Back Tens Field for soccer and rugby. Ron Joyce Stadium fields a full sized Canadian football field and FIFA sized soccer pitch. The stadium is also equipped with permanent seating for 5,500. The David Braley Athletic Centre, another sports venue at McMaster, is also used by the Marauders.

The Marauders football team on occasion used Ivor Wynne Stadium, the now-demolished home of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

==Football==
The McMaster football team has been competing in organized play since 1901 and currently plays in the Ontario University Athletics conference in Canadian Interuniversity Sport. The program has won eight Yates Cup conference championships and one Vanier Cup national championship, in 2011. As of the end of the 2011 CFL season, 51 McMaster Marauder alumni have played professionally in the Canadian Football League, including eight that currently play in the CFL.

==Championships==
The Marauders have won several championships since they began competitive play in their provincial conference, as well as within the national league they are in. The following is a table of the number of championships won by the Marauders men&#x27;s teams and individual competitors since the Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union was formed in 1961 as well as the number of championships won by Marauders women&#x27;s teams and individual competitors since the Ontario Women&#x27;s Interuniversity Athletic Association was formed in 1971.

The men&#x27;s water polo team has won the Ontario University Athletics championship 25 times, making it the most successful team at the provincial level. The men&#x27;s wrestling team has been the most successful team at the national level, winning the CIS championship four times.

<doc id="384849" wikidata="Q1128440" url="?curid=384849" title="Toxic shock syndrome">
<text>Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a condition caused by bacterial toxins. Symptoms may include fever, rash, skin peeling, and low blood pressure. There may also be symptoms related to the specific underlying infection such as mastitis, osteomyelitis, necrotising fasciitis, or pneumonia.
TSS is typically caused by bacteria of the &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; or &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; type, though others may also be involved. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is sometimes referred to as toxic-shock-like syndrome (TSLS). The underlying mechanism involves the production of superantigens during an invasive streptococcus infection or a localized staphylococcus infection. Risk factors for the staphylococcal type include the use of very absorbent tampons, skin lesions in young children characterized by fever, low blood pressure, rash, vomiting and/or diarrhea, and multiorgan failure. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms.
Treatment includes intravenous fluids, antibiotics, incision and drainage of any abscesses, and possibly intravenous immunoglobulin. The need for rapid removal of infected tissue via surgery in those with a streptococcal cause, while commonly recommended, is poorly supported by the evidence. Some recommend delaying surgical debridement. The overall risk of death is about 50% in streptococcal disease, and 5% in staphylococcal disease. Death may occur within 2 days.
In the United States, the incidence of menstrual staphylococcal TSS declined sharply in the 1990s, while both menstrual and nonmenstrual cases have stabilized at about 0.3 to 0.5 cases per 100,000 population. Streptococcal TSS (STSS) saw a significant rise in the mid-1980s and has since remained stable at 2 to 4 cases per 100,000 population. In the developing world, the number of cases is usually on the higher extreme. TSS was first described in 1927. It came to be associated with very absorbent tampons that were removed from sale soon after.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) vary depending on the underlying cause. TSS resulting from infection with the bacterium &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; typically manifests in otherwise healthy individuals via signs and symptoms including high fever, accompanied by low blood pressure, malaise and confusion, which can rapidly progress to stupor, coma, and multiple organ failure. The characteristic rash, often seen early in the course of illness, resembles a sunburn (conversely, streptococcal TSS will rarely involve a sunburn-like rash), and can involve any region of the body including the lips, mouth, eyes, palms and soles of the feet. In patients who survive, the rash desquamates (peels off) after 10–21 days. The initial presentation of symptoms can be hard to differentiate from septic shock and other conditions such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, rubeola, leptospirosis, drug toxicities, and viral exanthems.

STSS caused by the bacterium &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, or TSLS, typically presents in people with pre-existing skin infections with the bacteria. These individuals often experience severe pain at the site of the skin infection, followed by rapid progression of symptoms as described above for TSS.

== Pathophysiology ==

In both TSS (caused by &quot;S. aureus&quot;) and TSLS (caused by &quot;S. pyogenes&quot;), disease progression stems from a superantigen toxin. The toxin in &quot;S. aureus&quot; infections is TSS Toxin-1, or TSST-1. The TSST-1 is secreted as a single polypeptide chain. The gene encoding toxic shock syndrome toxin is carried by a mobile genetic element of &quot;S. aureus&quot; in the SaPI family of pathogenicity islands. The toxin causes the non-specific binding of MHC II, on professional antigen presenting cells, with T-cell receptors, on T cells.

In typical T-cell recognition, an antigen is taken up by an antigen-presenting cell, processed, expressed on the cell surface in complex with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in a groove formed by the alpha and beta chains of class II MHC, and recognized by an antigen-specific T-cell receptor. This results in polyclonal T-cell activation. Superantigens do not require processing by antigen-presenting cells but instead, interact directly with the invariant region of the class II MHC molecule. In patients with TSS, up to 20% of the body&#x27;s T-cells can be activated at one time. This polyclonal T-cell population causes a cytokine storm, followed by a multisystem disease.

==Risk factors==
A few possible causes of toxic shock syndrome are:
* Having strep throat or a viral infection like the flu or chickenpox
* Using tampons, especially if super-absorbent or left in longer than recommended 
* Using contraceptive sponges, diaphragms or other devices placed inside the vagina
* History of a recent birth, miscarriage, or abortion
* Having a skin infection like impetigo or cellulitis
* Cuts or open wounds on the skin
* Surgical wounds 
* Previously having TSS

==Diagnosis==
For staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome, the diagnosis is based upon CDC criteria defined in 2011, as follows:

# Body temperature &gt; 
# Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg
# Diffuse macular erythroderma
# Desquamation (especially of the palms and soles) 1–2 weeks after onset
# Involvement of three or more organ systems:
#* Gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea)
#* Muscular: severe myalgia or creatine phosphokinase level at least twice the upper limit of normal for laboratory
#* Mucous membrane hyperemia (vaginal, oral, conjunctival)
#* Kidney failure (serum creatinine &gt; 2 times normal)
#* Liver inflammation (bilirubin, AST, or ALT &gt; 2 times normal)
#* Low platelet count (platelet count &lt; 100,000 / mm3)
#* Central nervous system involvement (confusion without any focal neurological findings)
# Negative results of:
#* Blood, throat, and CSF cultures for other bacteria (besides &quot;S. aureus&quot;)
#* Negative serology for &quot;Rickettsia&quot; infection, leptospirosis, and measles

Cases are classified as confirmed or probable as follows:
* Confirmed: All six of the criteria above are met (unless the patient dies before desquamation can occur)
* Probable: Five of the six criteria above are met

== Treatment ==
The severity of this disease frequently warrants hospitalization. Admission to the intensive care unit is often necessary for supportive care (for aggressive fluid management, ventilation, renal replacement therapy and inotropic support), particularly in the case of multiple organ failure. Treatment includes removal or draining of the source of infection—often a tampon—and draining of abscesses. Outcomes are poorer in patients who do not have the source of infection removed.

Antibiotic treatment should cover both &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; and &quot;S. aureus&quot;. This may include a combination of cephalosporins, penicillins or vancomycin. The addition of clindamycin or gentamicin reduces toxin production and mortality.

In some cases doctors will prescribe other treatments such as blood pressure medications (to stabilize blood pressure if it is too low), dialysis, oxygen mask (to stabilize oxygen levels), and sometimes a ventilator. These will sometimes be used to help treat side effects of contracting TSS.

==Prognosis==

With proper treatment, people usually recover in two to three weeks. The condition can, however, be fatal within hours. TSS has a mortality rate of 30–70%. Children who are affected by TSS tend to recover easier than adults do.

== Complications ==
* Amputation of fingers, toes, and sometimes limbs
* Death
* Liver or kidney failure
* Heart problems
* Respiratory distress
* Septic shock
* Other abnormalities may occur depending on the case

== Prevention ==
During menstruation:
* Use pads at night instead of tampons
* Try to keep up with changing a tampon every 4 to 8 hours
* Use low absorbent tampons
* Follow directions when using vaginal contraceptives (sponges or diaphragms)
* Make sure to maintain good hygiene during a menstrual cycle

For anyone:
* Keep open wounds clean
* Watch wounds and cuts for signs of infection (e.g. pus, redness, and warm to touch)
* Keep personal items personal (e.g.towels, sheets, razors)
* Wash clothing and bedding in hot water

== Epidemiology ==
Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome is rare and the number of reported cases has declined significantly since the 1980s. Patrick Schlievert, who published a study on it in 2004, determined incidence at three to four out of 100,000 tampon users per year; the information supplied by manufacturers of sanitary products such as Tampax and Stayfree puts it at one to 17 of every 100,000 menstruating females, per year.

TSS was considered a sporadic disease that occurred in immunocompromised people. It was not a more well-known disease until the 1980s, when high-absorbency tampons were in use. Due to the idea of the tampons having a high absorbency this led users to believe that they could leave a tampon in for several hours. Doing this allowed the bacteria to grow and led to infection. This resulted in a spike of cases of TSS.

Philip M. Tierno Jr. helped determine that tampons were behind TSS cases in the early 1980s. Tierno blames the introduction of higher-absorbency tampons in 1978. A study by Tierno also determined that all-cotton tampons were less likely to produce the conditions in which TSS can grow; this was done using a direct comparison of 20 brands of tampons including conventional cotton/rayon tampons and 100% organic cotton tampons from Natracare. In fact, Dr Tierno goes as far to state, &quot;The bottom line is that you can get TSS with synthetic tampons, but not with an all-cotton tampon.&quot;

A rise in reported cases occurred in the early 2000s: eight deaths from the syndrome in California in 2002 after three successive years of four deaths per year, and Schlievert&#x27;s study found cases in part of Minnesota more than tripled from 2000 to 2003. Schlievert considers earlier onset of menstruation to be a cause of the rise; others, such as Philip M. Tierno and Bruce A. Hanna, blame new high-absorbency tampons introduced in 1999 and manufacturers discontinuing warnings not to leave tampons in overnight.

In Japan, Cases of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) reached 1,019 from January to June 2024, as compared to the 941 cases reported in 2023.

TSS is more common during the winter and spring and occurs most often in the young and old.

Toxic shock syndrome is commonly known to be an issue for those who menstruate, although fifty percent of Toxic Shock Syndrome cases are unrelated to menstruation. TSS in these cases can be caused by skin wounds, surgical sites, nasal packing, and burns.

== History ==
=== Initial description ===

The term &quot;toxic shock syndrome&quot; was first used in 1978 by a Denver pediatrician, James K. Todd, to describe the staphylococcal illness in three boys and four girls aged 8–17 years. Even though &quot;S. aureus&quot; was isolated from mucosal sites in the patients, bacteria could not be isolated from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine, raising suspicion that a toxin was involved. The authors of the study noted reports of similar staphylococcal illnesses had appeared occasionally as far back as 1927, but the authors at the time failed to consider the possibility of a connection between toxic shock syndrome and tampon use, as three of the girls who were menstruating when the illness developed were using tampons. Many cases of TSS occurred after tampons were left in after they should have been removed.

=== Rely tampons ===
Following controversial test marketing in Rochester, New York, and Fort Wayne, Indiana, in August 1978, Procter and Gamble introduced superabsorbent Rely tampons to the United States market in response to demands for tampons that could contain an entire menstrual flow without leaking or replacement. Rely used carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and compressed beads of polyester for absorption. This tampon design could absorb nearly 20 times its own weight in fluid. Further, the tampon would &quot;blossom&quot; into a cup shape in the vagina to hold menstrual fluids without leakage.

In January 1980, epidemiologists in Wisconsin and Minnesota reported the appearance of TSS, mostly in those menstruating, to the CDC. &quot;S. aureus&quot; was successfully cultured from most of the subjects. The Toxic Shock Syndrome Task Force was created and investigated the epidemic as the number of reported cases rose throughout the summer of 1980. In September 1980, CDC reported users of Rely were at increased risk for developing TSS.

On 22 September 1980, Procter and Gamble recalled Rely following release of the CDC report. As part of the voluntary recall, Procter and Gamble entered into a consent agreement with the FDA &quot;providing for a program for notification to consumers and retrieval of the product from the market&quot;. However, it was clear to other investigators that Rely was not the only culprit. Other regions of the United States saw increases in menstrual TSS before Rely was introduced.

It was shown later that higher absorbency of tampons was associated with an increased risk for TSS, regardless of the chemical composition or the brand of the tampon. The sole exception was Rely, for which the risk for TSS was still higher when corrected for its absorbency. The ability of carboxymethylcellulose to filter the &quot;S. aureus&quot; toxin that causes TSS may account for the increased risk associated with Rely.

==Notable cases==
* Clive Barker, fully recovered, contracted the syndrome after visiting the dentist.
* Lana Coc-Kroft, fully recovered, contracted the syndrome due to group A streptococcal infection.
* Jim Henson, d. 1990, contracted the syndrome due to group A streptococcal infection and subsequently died from it.
* Nan C. Robertson, d. 2009, the 1983 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing for &quot;Toxic Shock,&quot; her medically detailed account of her struggle with toxic shock syndrome, a cover story for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; which at that time became the most widely syndicated article in &quot;Times&quot; history.
* Barbara Robison, lead vocalist for the psychedelic rock band the Peanut Butter Conspiracy, was performing in Butte, Montana on 6 April 1988; during the concert, she fell ill and was transported to a hospital. She did not recover, and died sixteen days later on 22 April from toxic shock syndrome at the age of 42.
* Mike Von Erich, d. 1987, developed the syndrome after shoulder surgery: he made an apparent recovery but experienced brain damage and weight loss as a result of the condition; he died by suicide later.
