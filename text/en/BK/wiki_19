<text>Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications provides for a system of recognition of professional experience and promotes automatic recognition of professional experience across the European Union (EU). It covers the European Economic Area and has been amended several times. 

The qualifications of some professions, such as doctors and architects, have been extensively harmonised; in addition, it offers more general guidelines for other professions, that have not been specifically regulated this directive, or other specific rules. Any form of work that would normally be restricted in a member state to people who had gained a professional qualification in that member state are also open to nationals of the EU (and member states of the European Economic Area) who have gained a similar professional qualification in another member state.

Professions regulated in most or all EU states include:
;Accountancy : British-qualified accountants (Chartered Certified Accountant (ACCA) or Chartered Accountant (ACA or CA) or International Accountant (AIA) in the United Kingdom (UK) 
;Engineering : Chartered Engineer or EUR ING (European Engineer), Incorporated Engineer (UK), corporate membership of a UK professional engineering institution such as Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology
;Teaching : Teachers (qualified teacher status in the UK)
;Law : Lawyers (barristers, solicitors and advocates in the UK).

<doc id="377669" wikidata="Q592568" url="?curid=377669" title="4th World Scout Jamboree">
<text>The 4th World Scout Jamboree (Hungarian: &quot;4. Cserkész Világdzsembori&quot;), a gathering of Boy Scouts from all over the world, was hosted by Hungary and held from 2 to 13 August 1933. It was attended by 25,792 Scouts, representing 46 different nations and additional territories. They encamped around the Royal Palace in the Royal Forest of Gödöllő, about from the capital of Budapest.

==In attendance==
It was the second-to-last Jamboree for the founder of Scouting, Robert Baden-Powell. Baden-Powell and Hungarian head of state, Regent Horthy, addressed the Scouts from the grandstand built to accommodate over 5000 guests during an opening ceremony at the rally ground. Regent Horthy told the Scouts,

The Jamboree Camp Chief was the Chief Scout of Hungary, Count Teleki Pál, a member of the International Committee who had previously been and would later once again become Prime Minister of Hungary. The General Camp Manager was Vitez Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff officer of the Hungarian Royal Army, who was later appointed the Chief Scout of Hungary upon Teleki Pál&#x27;s death in 1941.

This event was notable as the first international gathering where Air Scouts were represented, including the famous pilots, László Almásy and Robert Kronfeld. A meeting of Skolta Esperanto Ligo took also place at the Jamboree.

 Countries and territories with contingents of Scouts present included Hungary, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Irish Free State, England, Jamaica, Trinidad, Switzerland, Sweden, Armenia, the Netherlands, Poland, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Australia, New Zealand, British Guiana, Canada, Newfoundland, Ceylon, South Africa, Austria, Romania, Norway, Portugal, Siam, Spain, Haiti, Greece, France, Gibraltar, India, Philippines, United States, Bulgaria, Liechtenstein, Belgium, Syria, Denmark, Iceland, Egypt, Iran, Japan, Malta, Palestine, Rhodesia, the Duchy of Luxemburg, and Russian Emigrant Scouts. They lived in ten sub-camps. The overall encampment was serviced by its own post office, ambulance station, hospital, a steam railroad and station, an electric local streetcar line with four stations, radio service, 14 km water supply with 9 wells and an air-service.

The Jamboree daily paper, &quot;Magyar Cserkész&quot;, was printed in Hungarian, English, French and German, with contributions in other languages. Every foreign group at the Jamboree was assigned a &quot;cousin&quot;—a Hungarian Scout who spoke their language and served as translator and guide. They wore on their right arm a white band displaying two interlocked hands embroidered in red. Over their shirt pocket they wore an embroidered patch stating their language specialty, for example, &quot;Parle Français,&quot; &quot;Spricht Deutsch&quot; or &quot;Speaks English.&quot;

During the Jamboree, about 365,000 people including 100,000 from the nearby city of Gödöllő and the surrounding districts visited the Scouts from many nations, seeking &quot;autograms&quot;—autographs—and &quot;change,&quot; or to trade clothing, patches, and more.
The total expenditure was 1,660,000 Pengő (~ 332,000 US dollar), total income was 1,668,000 Pengő (~ 333,600 US dollar).

==Jamboree symbol: the White Stag==
The white stag of Hungarian mythology was the national symbol of Hungary and the official badge of the Jamboree. During the Jamboree, Scouts from the American contingent learned from their Hungarian &quot;cousin&quot; the meaning of the White Stag on their jamboree patch:
Baden-Powell also referred to the symbol of the Hungarian people in his farewell address to the assembled Scouts:

<text>Nishan-e-Haider (NH; or &#x27;Emblem of the Lion&#x27;) is the highest military gallantry award of Pakistan. The Nishan-e-Haider is awarded only to members of the Pakistan Armed Forces. It recognises the highest acts of extraordinary bravery in the face of the enemy in air, land, or sea. It has been awarded only 11 times since Pakistan&#x27;s independence in 1947.

Nishan-e-Haider literally means &quot;Emblem of the Lion&quot; in the Urdu language. The word &quot;Haider&quot; is also the epithet of Ali, who is referred to as the &#x27;Lion of Allah&#x27;, a valiant warrior and leader. Ali was the fourth Caliph of Islam and declared bravest person by Muhammad. He is known by his courage, bravery and power in Islam.

==History==
The Nishan-e-Haider was established by the Government of Pakistan and named after Ali on 14 August 1947, the year that Pakistan became a republic. It was applied retrospectively from the date of Pakistan&#x27;s independence on 14 August 1947. It is Pakistan&#x27;s highest award and takes precedence over all military and civil awards. Of the eleven Nishan-e-Haider recipients to date, ten have been from the Army and one from the Air Force.

Although some consider it equivalent to the British Victoria Cross and the United States Medal of Honor, it is unique in that it has so far been awarded only posthumously. At one point in time the Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan was asked why it was only awarded posthumously, his response reportedly that if it is awarded to a living person he may be involved in dishonourable conduct in the future which may disgrace the Award.

==Criterion==
The Nishan-e-Haider can be awarded to all ranks of the Armed Forces for showing feats of extraordinary courage in confronting the enemy. As a matter of practice and precedent, it has only been awarded where it has been established that the recipient acted despite high risks and was martyred (shaheed) in the act.

==Manufacturing==
The Nishan-e-Haider is manufactured by Pakistan Mint on the order of the Ministry of Defence. It is forged from captured enemy equipment and consists of 88% copper, 10% gold, and 2% zinc.

<text>Lloyd Tilghman (January 18, 1816 – May 16, 1863) was a Confederate general in the American Civil War.

A railroad construction engineer by background, he was selected by the Confederate government to build two forts to defend the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers. The location of Fort Henry on the Tennessee was vulnerable to flooding, but Tilghman was slow to spot this, and his surrender of the fort to U.S. Grant in February 1862 was regarded as a disgrace. Taken prisoner and exchanged, he commanded a brigade in the Vicksburg campaign, and was killed by a shell at the Battle of Champion Hill, where he was widely praised for gallantry.

Tilghman owned five slaves.

==Early life==

Tilghman was born in &quot;Rich Neck Manor&quot;, Claiborne, Maryland to James Tilghman who was the great-grandson of Matthew Tilghman, and Ann C. Shoemaker Tilghman. He attended the United States Military Academy and graduated near the bottom of his class in 1836. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Dragoons, but resigned his commission after three months. He worked as a construction engineer on a number of railroads in the South and in Panama, except for a period in which he returned to the Army as a captain in the Maryland and Washington, D.C. Volunteer Artillery (August 1847 to July 1848). In 1852, he took up residence in Paducah, Kentucky.

==Civil War==
Tilghman was commissioned colonel of the 3rd Kentucky Infantry on July 5, 1861, shortly after the start of the American Civil War. He was promoted to brigadier general in the Confederate States Army on October 18. When General Albert Sidney Johnston was looking for an officer to create defensive positions on the vulnerable Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, he was unaware of Tilghman&#x27;s presence in his department and another officer was selected. However, the Richmond government pointed out Tilghman&#x27;s engineering background and he was finally chosen for the task. The original sites for Forts Henry and Donelson were selected by another general, Daniel S. Donelson, but Tilghman was then placed in command and ordered to construct them. The geographic placement of Fort Henry was extremely poor, sited on a floodplain of the Tennessee River, but Tilghman did not object to its location until it was too late. (Afterward, he wrote bitterly in his report that Fort Henry was in a &quot;wretched military position ... The history of military engineering records no parallel to this case.&quot;) He also was desultory in managing its needed construction and that of the small Fort Heiman, located on the Kentucky bank of the Tennessee, and quarreled with the engineers assigned to the task. He did manage to do a more creditable job on the construction of Fort Donelson, which was sited on dry ground, commanding the river.

On February 6, 1862, an army under Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and gunboats under Flag Officer Andrew H. Foote attacked Fort Henry and Tilghman was forced to surrender. (This was not his first encounter with Grant. Tilghman was in Paducah when Grant captured that city the previous September.) Prior to doing so, he led the vast majority of his garrison troops on the 12-mile road to Fort Donelson, and then returned to surrender with a handful of artillerymen who were left defending the fort. The biggest factor in the defeat of Fort Henry was not the naval artillery or Grant&#x27;s infantry; it was the rising flood waters of the Tennessee, which flooded the powder magazines and forced a number of the guns out of action. (If Grant&#x27;s attack had been delayed by two days, the battle would have never occurred because the fort was by then entirely underwater.) Tilghman was imprisoned as a prisoner of war at Fort Warren in Boston and was not released until August 15, when he was exchanged for Union general John F. Reynolds. He was replaced by Brig. Gen. John B. Floyd at Donelson, whose army surrendered to Grant on February 16.

Returning to the field in the fall of 1862, Tilghman became a brigade commander in Mansfield Lovell&#x27;s division of Earl Van Dorn&#x27;s Army of the West, following the Second Battle of Corinth. In the Vicksburg Campaign of 1863, he was hit in the chest by a shell and killed in the Battle of Champion Hill. 

Tilghman was initially interred in the Soldiers Rest section of Vicksburg&#x27;s Cedar Hill Cemetery. His body was moved in 1902 to Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx, where he was buried beside his wife who had moved to the city.

==Eyewitness accounts==
&quot;Orderly Sergeant E. T. Eggleston&quot;

Tilghman came to our position, in an open field, on foot. He was in particular good humor. He wore a new fatigue uniform. When he arrived near our guns our officers were mounted, and were in position prescribed for dress parade, each Lieutenant, George H. Tompkins and Thomas J. Haines, in their positions, and Captain Cowan mounted on a large grey horse, making a conspicuous target for the Federal sharpshooters. We were all tyros in war at that time. The General in a pleasant manner said to our Captain, I think you and your Lieutenants had better dismount. They are shooting pretty close to us, and I do not know whether they are shooting at your fine grey horse or my new uniform. They very promptly obeyed the suggestion.Having to go to headquarters daily with reports, I had become personally acquainted with the affable, gallant, and genial officer. Only a few minutes before his death we were sitting on a log near a strip of woodland discussing the line of battle we then held, comparing it with the one we had shortly before occupied. He got up from the log and went to one of our guns, a 12-pound Napoleon, Corporal Tommie Johnson, gunner, and remarked to him, I think you are shooting rather too high, and sighted the gun himself. He returned to a little knoll within a few feet of the log on which I was still sitting and was standing erect, his field glasses to his eyes, watching for the effect of the shot from our gun when he received the fatal wound not from a splinter from a shell, however, but from a solid shot. It is true that a horse was killed by the same missile and I noticed that the horse was dead some time before he General ceased to breathe, though he was unconscious.It was some little time after the general fell before his son, a youth, could be found, and I shall never forget the touching scene when the grief and lamentations he cast himself on his dying and unconscious father. Those of us who witnessed this distressing scene shed tears of sympathy, for the bereaved son and of sorrow for our fallen hero, the chivalrous and beloved Tilghman.

&quot;Private James Spencer, 1st Mississippi Light Artillery&quot;

&quot;General Tilghman and his staff rode up to Capt. Cowan and ordered him to open fire. The General dismounted and said to Capt. Cowan, I will take a shot at those fellows myself, and walked up to field piece No. 2 and sighted and ordered it fired and shell from the Federal Battery passed close to him while our gun was being reloaded. Tilghman remarked, ‘They are trying to spoil my new uniform.’ He then sighted the gun again and as he stepped back to order fire, a Parrott shell struck him in the side, nearly cutting him in twain. Just before he dismounted, he ordered his son, a boy of about 17 years to go with a squad and drive some sharpshooters from a gin house on our left, who were annoying our cannoneers. The son had been gone 10 or 15 minutes on this mission before his father was killed.&quot;

&quot;Emilie Riley McKinley: May 21, 1863&quot;

&quot;Gen. Tilghman was carried to Mrs. Brien&#x27;s house at night by torchlight. His hair was covered with blood. His son accompanied him. They thought at first of burying him in our churchyard but carried him to Vicksburg. Poor Gen. Tilghman – he was brave to a fault. We little thought a week ago when he passed this place that he would in so short a time be dead. I saw him last Fall in Jackson directly after his return from a prison at the North, Fort Warren. He made a speech at the Bowman House [hotel] and told us how cruelly he had been treated in prison. And now poor fellow, he is gone, but his name will live forever. He fell bravely defending his fireside and home. May he rest in peace.&quot;

&quot;Colonel A. E. Reynolds, 26th Mississippi Infantry, Commanding First Brigade. Report: Near Jackson, Miss., May 27, 1863 (Battle of Champion&#x27;s Hill)&quot;

&quot;At 5.20 o&#x27;clock, Brig. Gen. Tilghman, who up to that time had commanded the brigade with marked ability, fell, killed by a shell from one of the enemy&#x27;s guns, and the command devolved upon me as the senior colonel present. I cannot here refrain from paying a slight tribute to the memory of my late commander. As a man, a soldier, and a general, he had few if any superiors. Always at his post, he devoted himself day and night to the interests of his command. Upon the battlefield cool, collected, and observant, he commanded the entire respect and confidence of every officer and soldier under him, and the only censure ever cast upon him was that he always exposed himself too recklessly. At the time he was struck down he was standing in the rear of a battery, directing a change in the elevation of one of the guns. The tears shed by his men on the occasion, and the grief felt by his entire brigade, are the proudest tribute that can be given the gallant dead.&quot;

&quot;General William W. Loring: Military Report&quot;

&quot;During this time Tilghman, who had been left with his brigade upon the road, almost immediately after our parting, met a terrible assault of the enemy, and when we rejoined him was carrying on a deadly and most gallant fight. With less than 1,500 effective men he was attacked from by 6,000 to 8,000 of the enemy with a fine park of artillery, but being advantageously posted, he not only haled them in check, but repulsed him on several occasions, and this kept open the only line of retreat left to the army. The bold stand of his brigade under the lamented hero saved a large portion of the army. Quick and bold in the execution of his plans, he fell in the midst of a brigade that loved him well, after repulsing a powerful enemy in deadly fight, struck by a cannon-shot. A brigade wept over the dying hero; alike beautiful as it was touching.&quot;

==Posthumous commentary==
&quot;Maria I. Johnston: Novel published 1869&quot;

Describing the arrival of Tilghman&#x27;s body in Vicksburg, transported in a wagon and accompanied by his teenage son: &quot;Stark and stiff lay the brave officer, his clothing and gloves covered with blood. And the gory stream congealing in the dark masses of his tangled hair.&quot;

&quot;Jefferson Davis, President, Confederate States of America (CSA), 1878&quot;

&quot;The Greek who held the pass, the Roma who for a time held the bridge have been immortalized in rhyme and story. But neither of those more heroically, more patriotically, more singly served his country, than did Tilghman at Fort Henry, when approached by a large army, an army which rendered the permanent defense of the fort impossible, with a handful of devoted followers went into the fort and continued the defense until his brigade could retire in safety to Fort Donelson; then when that work was finished, when it was impossible any longer to make a defense, when the wounded and dying lay all around him, he, with the surviving remnants of his little band, terminated the struggle and suffered in a manner thousands of you have been prisoners of war know how to estimate. All peace and honor to his ashes, for he was among those, not the most unhappy, who went hence before our bitterest trials came upon us.&quot;

&quot;F.W.M. published account: July 13, 1893 @ Plant City, Florida&quot;

&quot;General Tilghman directed the gun sergeant to train his gun, a 12-pound howitzer, and dislodge the enemy from the cabins. He dismounted from his horse and gave some directions about sighting the gun. While this was being done, a shell from one of the enemy&#x27;s guns on the line exploded about fifty feet to the front. A ragged fragment of this shell struck the General in the breast, passing through him and killing the horse of his Adjutant a little farther to the rear. His death occurred, of course, very soon, and his remains were carried to the rear. That night they were started to Vicksburg, accompanied by his personal staff and son, Lloyd Tilghman, Jr., and the next evening they were buried in the city cemetery in Vicksburg. The last act of a brave man was to sight a field gun and direct the cutting of a shell fuse, so as to do the best execution upon the invaders of our country.&quot;

==In memoriam==
The Lloyd Tilghman House and Civil War Museum is located at the Tilghman homestead in Paducah. On May 19, 1926, a statue of Tilghman was dedicated at the Vicksburg National Historical Park.

==Tilghman&#x27;s effects==
A Presentation Confederate Flag and an inscribed sword and sword belt, worn by Tilghman when he was killed were sold by Heritage Auction Galleries on June 26, 2010. The items were passed down through his direct lineal descendants for almost 150 years until sold at auction.

<doc id="377676" wikidata="Q215960" url="?curid=377676" title="Wilhelm Wassmuss">
<text>Wilhelm Wassmuss (1880 – November 29, 1931; German spelling: Waßmuß) was a German diplomat and spy and part of Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition, known as &quot;Wassmuss of Persia&quot;. According to British versions of history, he &quot;attempted to foment trouble for the British&quot; in the Persian Gulf in the First World War.

==Birth and schooling==
Wilhelm Wassmuss was born in 1880 in Ohlendorf, 60 kilometers south-east of Hanover, Germany, and after a university education he entered the German Foreign Office in 1906. Sent first to Madagascar, he was promoted to vice consul and assigned to the German Consulate in the Persian port town of Bushehr by the Persian Gulf in 1909. In 1910 he was returned to Madagascar where, rarely seen in public, he spent three years in an obsessive study of the desert and its peoples. In 1913, he was relocated back to Bushehr. While the details of what happened next are sketchy, it seems that with the start of World War I, Wassmuss appears to have recognized that now was the time to foment a revolt. During his stay in Bushehr, Mohammad ali Shabankareh (the governor of Shabankareh and the suburbs) also invited him in the castle of Rostam Khani to give him support for the opposition in faith and financial assistance.
As part of the Anglo-Russian Entente within The Great Game, Persia was divided in a Russian Northern Zone, a British Southern zone and a neutral central zone.
He met with his superiors in Constantinople and as a result of that meeting, it was proposed that he organize and lead the Persians in a guerrilla war against Britain.
The plan was approved and the German Foreign Office amply supplied him with gold, on the direct order of Kaiser Wilhelm II who was enthusiastic about the plan. Although Wassmuss had no training in espionage, he became one of the first covert action operatives—an agent who does not specifically try to collect information but who functions in a foreign country to obtain a definite result.
==Consul to Iran in the First World War==
Wassmuss was a consular official, and in the first days of February 1915 Wassmuss and a few followers sailed a river steamer named SS &quot;Pioneer&quot; down the Tigris river to a point some 65 kilometers below Kut al Amara in Mesopotamia (a town about 160 kilometers southeast of Baghdad). The &quot;Pioneer&quot; had served both the Turks and Royal Navy in the war. From there Wassmuss&#x27; party moved eastward into Iran where he began work on a grandiose mission, something the empire-builders in Germany’s Foreign Office had dreamed about for years, the ending of Anglo-Russian domination in the Middle East. Britain had outposts in Persia and Kuwait to protect its interests in India. Also, oil from the Persian Gulf began to flow to Britain from a new refinery and port at Abadan. Kut was later the site of a strategic battle, where the British general Townsend and his British and Indian army were besieged and defeated by the Ottoman Turks with German Army assistance.

==The Lawrence of Persia against British–Russian coalition before WWI==

Wilhelm Wassmuss would achieve further victory if he succeeded in bringing Iran into the war on the German side and, failing that, by organizing revolts among the Iranians against the British occupiers. Wassmuss was a brave but short, broad and heavy man, with high forehead and blue eyes generally looking upward, and slightly melancholy mouth. While always a fervently patriotic German, he was also a mystic, a megalomaniac and a fanatic, a European who had learned to love the Mesopotamian desert and had educated himself into an intimate knowledge of it, its people, and their customs and languages. He was both a consummate liar as well as a man of deep principles. He was an actor, a man who enjoyed wearing the flowing robes of a desert tribesman, but he was also a hero. He became known as Wassmuss of Persia, and successfully organized and led a revolt against the British occupiers.

Based in Bushehr, Wassmuss organised the Tangestani and Qashqai tribes to revolt against the British in the south of the country. In March 1915, him and his entourage were captured by the Hayat-Dawudi, allies of the British. Although he managed to escape, his companions and his copy of the German diplomatic code book fell into enemy hands. This enabled Admiral Hall of the famed Room 40 to read German diplomatic communications through much of World War I (see Zimmermann Telegram).

In Iran, Wassmuss first passed through the market towns of Dezful and Shushtar. He conferred with the local chieftains and distributed pamphlets urging the tribesmen into a revolt against Britain. Once he started, any secrecy quickly dissolved and the local police at Shushtar tried to arrest him. He was warned and managed to escape but was soon in peril again. He traveled south some 160 kilometers to the town of Behbahan. Here the apparently friendly local chieftain invited him to dinner, and then promptly placed him under armed guard. The chieftain, planning to sell Wassmuss to the British, sent a messenger to them. The messenger met a British detachment on the road and excitedly told its mounted officers of the capture. They immediately galloped to Behbahan but once there, they lost valuable minutes through the politeness of Eastern protocol in the discussion of the chieftain’s price for Wassmuss. These moments were critical because when the officers went to take their prisoner he was gone. However, although Wassmuss had escaped, he left his luggage behind. It was found by the British in the chieftain’s courtyard and delivered unopened into storage in London.

Wassmuss’ story of his escape is beyond credibility. Wassmuss claimed that he told his guards his horse was sick. Every hour, (he claimed) he was then escorted under guard, to his horse’s stable (where he looked at the horse?), but in the early morning the guards were sleepy and grown tired of escorting him across the small courtyard to the stable. They therefore didn&#x27;t bother escorting him, so he galloped away.

The British had read Wassmuss&#x27; pamphlets and realized he had to be stopped; they also knew doing this would not be easy because as the days went on, Wassmuss was rapidly becoming famous throughout Iran. First, he organized the Bakhtiari people, then he purchased the loyalty of other tribes. However, although successful, he continually raged about his lost luggage, and in doing this, called attention to it. He went as far as insisting to see the Governor at the Persian provincial capital of Shiraz to formally protest his lost luggage and demand its return. This, of course, was impossible since it was held by the India Office in London. A German code book was later found in his luggage and sent to Room 40.

==Post-war promises==

Wassmuss survived the war. For a time, he had been dazzlingly successful in Iran, but tribal support for him began to fade when it became obvious to the tribal leaders that Germany was not defeating Britain. After the war, Wassmuss, whose network had spread through Afghanistan and as far as India, and for whom the British had offered a $500,000 reward, was imprisoned by the British. He was released in 1920 and made his way back to Berlin. Once there, the man who had eloquently lied to the Persian tribesmen on Germany’s behalf struggled to persuade the German Foreign Office to honor his pledges and pay the money he had promised to the tribes; the German government refused.

As the post-war years went by, Wassmuss could not forget his promises. He returned to Bushehr in 1924 and, purchasing cheap farmland, promised to repay the tribesmen from the profits he hoped to make from farming. The farm failed. After legal squabbles over money with some of the tribal chieftains who once been his friends, Wilhelm Wassmuss returned to Berlin in April 1931. A broken man, he died virtually forgotten and in poverty in November 1931.

<text>Coucy-la-Ville () is a commune in the Aisne department in Hauts-de-France in northern France.

On the main Chauny to Soissons road, shortly after the village of Folembray, take a right hand turn and within half a mile you will come to the village of Coucy-la-Ville.

A single road runs through this small village passing a farm, a cafe-bar and a church. Then, as suddenly as you entered, you have left this small place. Up on the hill to your right you will see the remarkable view of the remains of the Château de Coucy, located in Coucy-le-Château-Auffrique. Down in Coucy-la-Ville, the area is flat and agricultural with its few houses dotted on either side of the road.

<doc id="377688" wikidata="Q1823879" url="?curid=377688" title="Tubular pin tumbler lock">
<text>A tubular pin tumbler lock, also known as a circle pin tumbler lock, radial lock, or the trademark Ace lock popularized by manufacturer Chicago Lock Company since 1933, is a variety of pin tumbler lock in which a number of pins are arranged in a circular pattern, and the corresponding key is tubular or cylindrical in shape. Most locks use between six and eight pins, although some use as few as four or as many as ten. The devices have been widely used on vending machines, elevators, public computers, and bicycle locks.

== Design ==
The design of a tubular lock is similar to the pin tumbler lock, in that there are several &quot;stacks&quot; of pins. The key is a cylinder shape with notches cut around the outer or (rarely) inner edge. Each of these notches depresses a single pin inside the lock to a specific height allowing the &quot;lock cylinder&quot; to turn freely.

== Uses ==
Tubular locks are commonly seen on bicycle locks (such as the Kryptonite lock), Kensington computer locks, elevators, and a variety of coin-operated devices such as vending machines, and coin-operated washing machines.

Tubular pin tumbler locks are often considered to be safer and more resistant to picking than standard locks. This is primarily because they are often seen on coin boxes for vending machines and coin-operated machines, such as those used in a laundromat. However, the primary reason this type of lock is used in these applications is that it can be made physically shorter than other locks.

== Vulnerabilities ==
Such locks can be picked by a special tubular lock pick with a minimum of effort in very little time; it is also possible to defeat them by drilling with a hole-saw drill bit. Standard tubular-lock drill bit diameters are and . To prevent drilling, many tubular locks have a middle pin made from hardened steel or contain a ball bearing in the middle pin.

Some tubular locks, such as those used on older models of Kryptonite-brand bike locks, can be opened with the back end of a ball-point pen.

<text>The Oka (, ; ) is a river in central Russia, the largest right tributary of the Volga. It flows through the regions of Oryol, Tula, Kaluga, Moscow, Ryazan, Vladimir and Nizhny Novgorod and is navigable over a large part of its total length, as far upstream as the town of Kaluga. Its length is and its catchment area . The Russian capital Moscow sits on one of the Oka&#x27;s tributaries—the Moskva, from which the capital&#x27;s name is thought to be derived.

== Name and history ==
The Oka river was the homeland of the Eastern Slavic Vyatichi tribe. By the 5th century the land around the Oka river was inhabited by different Slavic tribes. The Baltic tribe of Galindians also lived in the western part of the Oka basin. Turkic tribes also inhabited the Oka area. The Oka river was also inhabited by Vikings and other peoples from Scandinavia. Artifacts of Scandinavian origin were found along the Oka–Volga route. There is no consensus opinion where the name Oka originated from. It could, however, be cognate with Sanskrit ओघ &quot;ogha&quot;, meaning &#x27;stream&#x27; or &#x27;current&#x27;.

From the Mongol conquest until about 1633, the Oka was the last line of defense against steppe raiders. Later Zasechnaya cherta, a chain of fortification lines, was created to protect Grand Duchy of Moscow and later the Tsardom of Russia from the Crimean-Nogai Raids. It was south of the original line along the Oka.

The river gave its name to the Upper Oka Principalities, situated upstream from Tarusa. In 1221 Grand Duke Yuri II of Vladimir founded Nizhny Novgorod, later to become one of largest Russian cities, to protect the Oka&#x27;s confluence with the Volga. The Qasim Khanate, a Muslim polity, occupied the middle reaches of the Oka (around the city of Kasimov) in the 15th and 16th centuries.

Before the construction of the railways in the mid-19th century and the building of the Moscow Canal in the 1930s, the Oka, along with its tributary Moskva, served as an important transportation route connecting Moscow with the Volga. Due to the Oka&#x27;s and Moskva&#x27;s meandering courses, travel was not particularly fast: for example, it took Cornelis de Bruijn around 10 days to sail from Moscow down these two rivers to Nizhny Novgorod in 1703. Traveling upstream may have been even slower, as the boats had to be pulled by burlaks.

== Landmarks ==
The banks of the river are dotted with historical and cultural sites, including the medieval monasteries of Murom, the mosques and minarets of Kasimov, the fortified kremlins of Kolomna and Serpukhov, the memorial houses of Vasily Polenov and Sergey Yesenin, the excavated ruins of Old Ryazan and the Oka Shukhov Tower.

The Prioksko-Terrasny Biosphere Reserve lies along the left bank of the river opposite the town of Pushchino and is known for its wisent breeding nursery. 

==In culture==
The Oka appears as the title and main theme in a popular, nostalgia-filled military field song written by Leon Pasternak of the Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division, which was founded near the river in 1943. The song compares the river to the Vistula river in Poland. The unit fought all the way to Berlin in subordination to the Red Army.

<doc id="377691" wikidata="Q444351" url="?curid=377691" title="Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry">
<text>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, or DEXA) is a means of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) with spectral imaging. Two X-ray beams, with different energy levels, are aimed at the patient&#x27;s bones. When soft tissue absorption is subtracted, the bone mineral density (BMD) can be determined from the absorption of each beam by bone. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is the most widely used and most thoroughly studied bone density measurement technology.

The DXA scan is typically used to diagnose and follow osteoporosis, as contrasted to the nuclear bone scan, which is sensitive to certain metabolic diseases of bones in which bones are trying to heal from infections, fractures, or tumors. It is also sometimes used to assess body composition.

==Physics==
Soft tissue and bone have different attenuation coefficients to X-rays. A single X-ray beam passing through the body is attenuated by both soft tissue and bone, and it is not possible to determine from a single beam how much attenuation is attributable to the bone. However, attenuation coefficients vary with the energy of the X-rays, and, crucially, the ratio of the attenuation coefficients also varies. DXA uses two energies of X-ray. The difference in total absorption between the two can be used, by suitable weighting, to subtract out the absorption by soft tissue, leaving just the absorption by bone, which is related to bone density.

One type of DXA scanner uses a cerium filter with a tube voltage of 80 kV, resulting in effective photon energies of about 40 and 70 keV. Another type of DXA scanner uses a samarium filter with a tube voltage of 100 kV, which produces effective energies of 47 and 80 keV. Also, the tube voltage can be continuously switched between a low (for example 70 kV) and high (for example 140 kV) value in synchronism with the
frequency of the electrical mains, resulting in effective energies alternating between 45 and 100 keV.

The combination of dual X-ray absorptiometry and laser uses the laser to measure the thickness of the region scanned, allowing for varying proportions of lean soft tissue and adipose tissue within the soft tissue to be controlled for and improving the accuracy.

==Bone density measurement==
===Indications===

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women over the age of 65 should get a DXA scan. The age when men should be tested is uncertain, but some sources recommend age 70. At risk women should consider getting a scan when their risk is equal to that of a normal 65-year-old woman.

A person&#x27;s risk can be measured with the University of Sheffield&#x27;s FRAX calculator—which includes many clinical risk factors, including prior fragility fracture, use of glucocorticoids, heavy smoking, excess alcohol intake, rheumatoid arthritis, history of parental hip fracture, chronic renal and liver disease, chronic respiratory disease, long-term use of phenobarbital or phenytoin, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and other risks.

===Scoring===

The World Health Organization has defined the following categories based on bone density in white women:
Bone densities are often given to patients as a T score or a Z score. A T score tells the patient what their bone mineral density is in comparison to a young adult of the same gender with peak bone mineral density. A normal T score is -1.0 and above, low bone density is between -1.0 and -2.5, and osteoporosis is -2.5 and lower. A Z score is just a comparison of what a patient&#x27;s bone mineral density is in comparison to the average bone mineral density of a male or female of their age and weight.

The WHO committee did not have enough data to create definitions for men or other ethnic groups.
Special considerations are involved in the use of DXA to assess bone mass in children. Specifically, comparing the bone mineral density of children to the reference data of adults (to calculate a T-score) underestimates the BMD of children, because children have less bone mass than fully developed adults. This would lead to an over-diagnosis of osteopenia for children. To avoid an overestimation of bone mineral deficits, BMD scores are commonly compared to reference data for the same gender and age (by calculating a Z-score).

Also, there are other variables in addition to age that are suggested to confound the interpretation of BMD as measured by DXA. One important confounding variable is bone size. DXA has been shown to overestimate the bone mineral density of taller subjects and underestimate the bone mineral density of smaller subjects. This error is due to the way DXA calculates BMD. In DXA, bone mineral content (measured as the attenuation of the X-ray by the bones being scanned) is divided by the area (also measured by the machine) of the site being scanned.

Because DXA calculates BMD using area (aBMD: areal Bone Mineral Density), it is not an accurate measurement of true bone mineral density, which is mass divided by a volume. To distinguish DXA BMD from volumetric bone-mineral density, researchers sometimes refer to DXA BMD as an areal bone mineral density (aBMD). The confounding effect of differences in bone size is due to the missing depth value in the calculation of bone mineral density. Despite DXA technology&#x27;s problems with estimating volume, it is still a fairly accurate measure of bone mineral content. Methods to correct for this shortcoming include the calculation of a volume that is approximated from the projected area measure by DXA. DXA BMD results adjusted in this manner are referred to as the bone mineral apparent density (BMAD) and are a ratio of the bone mineral content versus a cuboidal estimation of the volume of bone. Like the results for aBMD, BMAD results do not accurately represent true bone mineral density, since they use approximations of the bone&#x27;s volume. BMAD is used primarily for research purposes and is not yet used in clinical settings.

Other imaging technologies such as quantitative computed tomography (QCT) are capable of measuring the bone&#x27;s volume, and are, therefore, not susceptible to the confounding effect of bone-size in the way that DXA results are susceptible.

It is important for patients to get repeat BMD measurements done on the same machine each time, or at least a machine from the same manufacturer. Error between machines, or trying to convert measurements from one manufacturer&#x27;s standard to another can introduce errors large enough to wipe out the sensitivity of the measurements.

DXA results must be adjusted if the patient is taking strontium supplements.

DXA can also used to measure trabecular bone score.

===Current clinical practice in pediatrics===
DXA is, by far, the most widely used technique for bone mineral density measurements, since it is relatively inexpensive, accessible, easy to use, and provides an accurate estimation of bone mineral density in adults.

The official position of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) is that a patient be tested for BMD if they have a condition that could precipitate bone loss, are to be prescribed pharmaceuticals known to cause bone loss, or are being treated and need reqiore monitoring. The ISCD states that there is no clearly understood correlation between BMD and the risk of a child&#x27;s sustaining a fracture; the diagnosis of osteoporosis in children cannot be made on the basis of densitometry criteria. T-scores are prohibited with children and should not even appear on DXA reports. Thus, the WHO classification of osteoporosis and osteopenia in adults cannot be applied to children, but Z-scores can be used to assist diagnosis.

Some clinics may routinely carry out DXA scans on pediatric patients with conditions such as nutritional rickets, lupus, and Turner syndrome. DXA has been demonstrated to measure skeletal maturity and body fat composition and has been used to evaluate the effects of pharmaceutical therapy. It may also aid pediatricians in diagnosing and monitoring treatment of disorders of bone mass acquisition in childhood.

However, it seems that DXA is still in its early days in pediatrics, and there are widely acknowledged limitations and disadvantages with DXA. A view exists that DXA scans for diagnostic purposes should not even be performed outside specialist centers, and, if a scan is done outside one of these centers, it should not be interpreted without consultation with an expert in the field. Furthermore, most of the pharmaceuticals given to adults with low bone mass can be given to children only in strictly monitored clinical trials.

Whole-body calcium measured by DXA has been validated in adults using in-vivo neutron activation of total body calcium but this is not suitable for paediatric subjects and studies have been carried out on paediatric-sized animals.

==Body composition measurement==

DXA scans can also be used to measure total body composition and fat content with a high degree of accuracy comparable to hydrostatic weighing with a few important caveats. From the DXA scans, a low resolution &quot;fat shadow&quot; image can also be generated, which gives an overall impression of fat distribution throughout the body. It has been suggested that, while very accurately measuring minerals and lean soft tissue (LST), DXA may provide skewed results due to its method of indirectly calculating fat mass by subtracting it from the LST and/or body cell mass (BCM) that DXA actually measures.

DXA scans have been suggested as useful tools to diagnose conditions with an abnormal fat distribution, such as familial partial lipodystrophy. They are also used to assess adiposity in children, especially to conduct clinical research.
==Radiation exposure==
DXA uses X-rays to measure bone mineral density. The radiation dose of current DEXA systems is small, as low as 0.001 mSv, much less than a standard chest or dental x-ray. However, the dose delivered by older DEXA radiation sources (that used radioisotopes rather than x-ray generators) could be as high as 35 mGy, considered a significant dose by radiological health standards.

==Regulation==
===United States===
The quality of DXA operators varies widely. DXA is not regulated like other radiation-based imaging techniques because of its low dosage. Each US state has a different policy as to what certifications are needed to operate a DXA machine. California, for example, requires coursework and a state-run test, whereas Maryland has no requirements for DXA technicians. Many states require a training course and certificate from the International Society of Clinical Densitometry (ISCD).

===Australia===
In Australia, regulation differs according to the applicable state or territory. For example, in Victoria, an individual performing DXA scans is required to completed a recognised course in safe use of bone mineral densitometers. In NSW and QLD a DXA technician only requires prior study in science, nursing or other related undergraduate study. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) oversees licensing of technicians, however, this is far from rigorous and regulation is non-existent.

<text>The Sulaiman Mountains, also known as Kōh-e Sulaymān (Balochi:; &quot;Mountains of Prophet Solomon&quot;) or Da Kasē Ghrūna (; &quot;Mountains of Qaes/Kasi&quot;), are a north–south extension of the southern Hindu Kush mountain system in Pakistan and Afghanistan. They are also known as Aparanchal Range, or Western Mountains (Sanskrit: अपरा; romanised: Aparā; literally: &quot;West&quot;; आंचल; romanised: ānchal; literally: &quot;mountains&quot; or &quot;mountainous region&quot;), as they mark the westernmost boundary of the Indian Subcontinent. They rise to form the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau. They are located in the Kandahar, Zabul and Paktia provinces of Afghanistan, and in Pakistan they extend over the northern part of Balochistan and Waziristan as well as Kurram of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In southwestern Punjab, the mountains extend into the two districts of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur, which are located west of the Indus River on the boundary with Balochistan. Bordering the mountains to the east are the plains of the Indus River valley, and to the north are the arid highlands of the Central Hindu Kush whose heights extend up to . The total area on which this range spans around 6,475 sq. km (2,500 sq mi). Together with the Kirthar Mountains on the border between Balochistan and Sindh, the Sulaiman Mountains form what is known as the Sulaiman-Kirthar geologic province.

The most well-known peak of the Sulaimans is the twin-peaked Takht-e-Sulaiman or &quot;Throne of Prophet Solomon&quot; at , located near Darazinda in Dera Ismail Khan Subdivision, close to the border with both South Waziristan and the Zhob District of neighboring Balochistan province. The highest peak, however, is Zarghun Ghar at near Quetta, Pakistan. The next highest peak in Balochistan province is Khilafat Hill at , which is located in the Ziarat District of Pakistan and is famous for the Ziarat Juniper Forest, where &quot;Juniperus macropoda&quot; trees grow.

==Geography==
The eastern edge of the Sulaiman range runs from the Gomal Pass in Pakistan&#x27;s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to near the city of Jacobabad in Sindh province, and further stretches into south-west Punjab.

In Afghanistan, the western edge of the range starts just beyond the northern Loya Paktia province where they meet the Koh-i-Baba range. South from there, they meet the Spin Ghar range northeast of Gardez in Paktia province, but towards west, the mountain range drops gradually in Kandahar southwest into Helmand and the Sistan Basin.

The Sulaiman Range, and the high plateaus to the west of it, helps form a natural barrier against the humid winds that blow from the Indian Ocean, creating arid conditions across southern and central Afghanistan to the west and north. In contrast, the relatively flat and low-lying Indus delta is situated due east and south of the Sulaimans. 

Rivers that drain the Sulaimans include the Gomal River which flows eastward into the Indus River, and the Dori River and other small tributaries of the Arghandab River, which flow southwestward into the Helmand River.

== Geology ==
The Sulaimans were formed as a fold and thrust belt as the Indian Plate collided into Eurasian Plate beginning about 30 million years ago. The Indian Plate&#x27;s counter-clockwise rotation as it collided with the Eurasian Plate resulted in the Sulaiman&#x27;s having some of the most complex tectonic structures in the world, including &quot;stacking&quot; of thrust faults. The complex fault-system is capable of producing doublet earthquakes that jump to other faults - such as the 1997 Harnai earthquake in which a magnitude 7.1 earthquake triggered a 6.8 earthquake 19 seconds later on a second fault 50 kilometres away.

Areas in the southern part of the range include an Imbricate fan of slices of rocks in close parallel, bounded by faults on either side of each slice. Along the Eastern edge of the Sulaimans is the Sulaiman Fold, an area within the Indian Plate consisting of sediment, alongside which runs the Ornach Nal-Ghazaband-Chaman Fault.

== Legends about Takht-e-Sulaiman ==

One of the highest peaks of the Sulaimans, the &quot;Takht-i Sulaiman&quot; (&quot;Throne of Solomon&quot;) at high, was recorded by Ibn Battuta as the &quot;Koh-i Sulaiman&quot;.

In legend, it is associated with Prophet Solomon. According to the legend, Prophet Solomon climbed this mountain and looked out over the land of South Asia, which was then covered with darkness, and so turned back without descending into this new frontier, and left only the mountain which is named after him (as told by Ibn Battuta). 

According to another legend, Noah&#x27;s Ark alighted on the &quot;Takht-i Sulaiman&quot; after the Deluge.

Another legend says that Qais Abdur Rashid, said to be the legendary ancestor of the Pashtun nation, is buried atop &quot;Takht-e-Sulaiman&quot;, and so it is also locally known as &quot;Da Kasī Ghar&quot; (د کسي غر, &quot;Mount of Qais&quot;). 

According to this legend, his descendants migrated west, north, and south from here. Some people visit the place and make animal sacrifices, usually a sheep or a goat, at the tomb of Qais to help feed the poor. Trips to the mountain is undertaken mostly in summer, since from late November until March the snowfall makes it difficult to climb.

<doc id="377695" wikidata="Q3695671" url="?curid=377695" title="Rashid Minhas">
<text>Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas () was a Pakistani fighter pilot and the fifth recipient of Pakistan&#x27;s highest military award, the Nishan-e-Haider. Minhas was the first and only officer from the Pakistan Air Force to receive the Nishan-e-Haider, and was also the youngest person and the shortest-serving officer to have received the award. During a routine training mission in August 1971, Minhas attempted to gain control of his jet trainer when his superior officer Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman hijacked the plane in an attempt to defect to India to join the Bangladesh War of Independence but crashed near the Thatta District, Sindh in Pakistan.

==Biography==
Rashid Minhas was born on 17 February 1951 to Begum Rashida Minhas (1926–2021), at Karachi in a Punjabi Muslim Rajput family of the Minhas clan. Rashid Minhas spent his early childhood in Karachi. Later, the family shifted to Rawalpindi, and shifted back to Karachi. Minhas was fascinated with aviation history and technology. He used to collect different models of aircraft and jets. He also attended St Patrick&#x27;s High School, Karachi.

The ancestors of Rashid Minhas were born in Qila Sobha Singh, East Punjab and later on they moved to Karachi and Rashid Minhas was born in Karachi. His father, Majeed Minhas, a civil engineer and an alumnus of the NED University in Karachi, was in a construction management business who later moved to Lahore, Punjab, for the construction project. He was educated in Lahore and took admission in the British-managed St. Mary&#x27;s School in Rawalpindi when his father found an employment opportunity. But later they permanently settled in Karachi.

He passed and qualified for his Senior Cambridge examination and performed well while finishing the O-level and A-level qualifications from the St. Patrick&#x27;s High School. His father, Majeed Minhas, wanted his son, Rashid, to follow his step by attending the engineering university and strongly desired for his son to gain a degree in engineering after finishing his high schooling in Karachi. Against the wishes of his father, Rashid entered in the PAF School in Lower Topa in 1968, the Air Force&#x27;s officer candidate school, and forwarded towards completing his military training at the Pakistan Air Force Academy in 1969.

==Death==

Having joined the air force, Minhas began training to become a pilot. On 20 August of that year, in the hour before noon, he was getting ready to take off in a T-33 jet trainer in Karachi, Pakistan. His second solo flight in that type of aircraft. Minhas was moving toward the runway when a Bengali instructor pilot, Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman, signalled him to stop and then climbed into the instructor&#x27;s seat. The jet took off and Rahman turned towards India.

Minhas radioed PAF Base Masroor with the message that he was being hijacked. The air controller requested that he resend his message and he confirmed the hijacking. Later investigation showed that Rahman intended to defect to India to join his compatriots in the Bangladesh War of Independence, along with the jet trainer. In the air, Minhas struggled physically to wrest control from Rahman; both men tried to overpower the other through the mechanically linked flight controls. Some from the Indian border, the jet crashed near Thatta. Both men were killed.

Minhas was posthumously awarded Pakistan&#x27;s top military honour, the Nishan-e-Haider, and became the youngest man and the only member of the Pakistan Air Force to win the award. Similarly, Rahman was honoured by Bangladesh with their highest military award, the Bir Sreshtho.

Minhas&#x27;s Pakistan military citation for the Nishan-e-Haider states that he &quot;forced the aircraft to crash&quot; to prevent Rahman from taking the jet to India. This is the official, popular and widely known version of how Minhas died. Yawar A. Mazhar, a writer for Pakistan Military Consortium, relayed in 2004 that he spoke to retired PAF Group Captain Cecil Chaudhry about Minhas and that he learned more details not generally known to the public. According to Mazhar, Chaudhry led the immediate task of investigating the wreckage and writing the accident report. Chaudhry told Mazhar that he found the jet had hit the ground nose first, instantly killing Minhas in the front seat. Rahman&#x27;s body, however, was not in the jet and the canopy was missing. Chaudhry searched the area and saw Rahman&#x27;s body some distance behind the jet, the body found with severe abrasions from hitting the sand at a low angle and a high speed. Chaudhry thought that Minhas probably jettisoned the canopy at low altitude causing Rahman to be thrown from the cockpit because he was not strapped in. Chaudhry felt that the jet was too close to the ground at that time, too far out of control for Minhas to be able to prevent the crash.

== Citation of Gallantry ==
== Legacy ==
After his death, Minhas was honoured as a national hero. In his memory, the Pakistan Air Force base at Kamra was renamed PAF Base Minhas, often called Minhas-Kamra. In Karachi, he was honoured by the naming of a main road, &#x27;Rashid Minhas Road&#x27; (). A two-rupee postage stamp bearing his image was issued by Pakistan Post in December 2003; 500,000 were printed.

<doc id="377697" wikidata="Q7374836" url="?curid=377697" title="Royal Society for Asian Affairs">
<text>The Royal Society for Asian Affairs (RSAA) is a learned society based in London (United Kingdom). Its objective is to advance public knowledge and understanding of Asia through its worldwide networks, its public events, its publications and its support to research. It is independent of governments and political bodies and does not take institutional positions on issues of policy at its meetings or in its publications. 

The Society was founded in 1901 as the Central Asian Society to &quot;promote greater knowledge and understanding of Central Asia and surrounding countries&quot;. The geographical extent of the society&#x27;s interest has since expanded to include the whole of Asia. Taylor &amp; Francis publishes the society&#x27;s journal, &quot;Asian Affairs&quot;, which has been in print since 1914.

== History ==
The society was founded in 1901 to promote greater knowledge and understanding of Central Asia and surrounding countries. But although Central Asia dominated the Society’s early interests, from the outset its members took the view that any Asian developments that could have a bearing on British interests in Central Asia fell within the Society’s remit. So when, in 1975, the Society changed its name to the Royal Society for Asian Affairs, it was acknowledging in its name what had been the practical reality since its earliest days.

== Activities ==
Meetings were traditionally held at a range of central London locations including the Royal Astronomical Society, the Society of Antiquaries, the Medical Society of London and the Army and Navy Club. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, all RSAA activities are online and many are open to the general public. Lectures are given by authoritative speakers roughly every two weeks on current affairs, history, culture and travel connected with all parts of Asia. Members of the Society receive the Society&#x27;s journal, &quot;Asian Affairs&quot;, and have free access to the entire back catalogue. They also have access to other events and social functions.

=== Education ===
The Society&#x27;s library and archive are currently housed at Hailebury where they may be consulted by prior arrangement. 

The journal of the society, &quot;Asian Affairs&quot;, is published quarterly by Taylor and Francis. It has been continuously in publication since 1914. It contains original articles and book reviews.

The Society has for many years run Schools&#x27; days jointly with the School of Oriental and African Studies, London for sixth-form students. These offer interested A-level students an opportunity to hear talks on a wide range of Asian topics and to try out a variety of Asian languages.

Through travel awards to young people, the RSAA supports practical projects and research that have the potential to contribute to advances in scholarly or other public knowledge including, but not limited to, post-graduate degrees, journalism and travel writing. The Society also administers grants to support medical electives in asian countries on behalf of the JPT Family Trust.

=== Awards ===
The Royal Society for Asian Affairs awards two medals, the &quot;Sir Percy Sykes Memorial Medal&quot; (named for Percy Sykes, honorary secretary 1924-1932) and the &quot;Lawrence of Arabia Memorial Medal&quot;, named for T. E. Lawrence, to individuals who have distinguished themselves in their contribution to cultural relations, exploration, research, or literature.

The Society also makes occasional special awards to individuals whose activities merit recognition falling outside the criteria for the Society&#x27;s two medals.

<text>Serpukhov () is a city in Moscow Oblast, Russia, located at the confluence of the Oka and the Nara Rivers, 99 kilometers (62 miles) south from Moscow and 72 kilometers (45 miles) from Moscow Ring Road on the Moscow—Simferopol highway. The Moscow—Tula railway passes through Serpukhov.

Serpukhov is at the centre of the Serpukhov Urban District which in turn lies at the heart of the with a population of more than 260,000 inhabitants.

In the 14th and early 15th centuries, Serpukhov was the capital of the principality. It was allocated to an independent administrative and economic unit with direct subordination to the executive committee of the regional council on September 14, 1939. Now a city of regional subordination, it is part of the municipality of the city district of Serpukhov.

In the modern era, Serpukhov became a local industrial center with textile, mechanical engineering, furniture, and paper-producing industries. The SeAZ factory produced the Lada Oka microcar since the 1980s. The Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve sprawls within from the city. By a resolution of the Moscow Regional Duma of April 28, 2016, the city was awarded the honorary title &quot;The Inhabited Point of Military Valor&quot;.

==Geography==
Serpukhov is located in the southern part of the Moscow Oblast on the Nara River, 99km from the center of Moscow and 73km from Moscow. Two regional centres, Tula and Kaluga, are located at approximately the same distance (about 80km) from Serpukhov. The city is located on the border of 3 regions (Moscow Oblast, Tula Oblast and Kaluga Oblast).

There were two large landfills in the city. The landfill &quot;Syanovo-1&quot; was closed after a major fire in 2017. The landfill &quot;Lesnaya&quot; was closed in 2021. It was the last landfill in the Moscow Oblast.

===Climate===

The climate is moderately continental. Conditions are determined by the impact of the transfer of air masses of western and south-western cyclones, the removal of Arctic air from the north and the transformation of air masses of different origins. The consequence of exposure to air masses from the Atlantic Ocean is the probability of winter thaws and wet cool periods in the summer. The influence of arctic cold masses affects in the form of severe cold snaps in the winter months and in the form of &quot;return of colds&quot; in the spring-summer period, in which the temperature drops down to frosts on the soil.

The coldest month of the year is January: The average temperature is 8.6 degrees C. The warmest month is July with an average temperature of 18.5 degrees C. Absolute maximum temperature is recorded on August 6, 2010: 39.4 degrees C. Days with frosts are recorded even in summer, except July and August. The average duration of a warm period is above 0 degrees Celsius, with an average daily temperature above 216 days per year. The growing season of plants is 180 days.

During the year, the southwest quarter winds prevail - south, southwest and west, the recurrence of which is 15%, 19% and 17%, respectively, and a total of 51%. The average annual wind speed is 3.0m/s. The average monthly wind speed is observed in winter, reaching a magnitude of 3.3m/s, the minimum in summer - 2.5-2.6m/s. In winter, the largest forces are the south-east and northwest winds (3.6m/s), in the summer - northern and north westerly (3.1-2.8m/s). Wind speed, the recurrence of which is 5% - 6m/s.

Precipitation is mainly determined by cyclonic activity. Precipitation associated with local circulation, even in summer, is a smaller proportion. The average long-term rainfall is 580–590mm. During the warm period falls the main (up to 70%) - the amount of precipitation.

The height of snow cover in open spaces is on average 38cm. In lowered and forested places the height of snow cover is much higher than specified, and it comes off later. The highest height of the snow cover reaches in March. The timing of the formation of a stable snow cover, as well as the timing of its appearance and convergence, vary greatly from year to year depending on the nature of the weather.

==Etymology==

The city in 1336 is referred to as Serpokhov, only from the 16th century entered into use the modern form of Serpukhov. There is still no clear explanation of the origin of Serpukhov&#x27;s place-by-point. There are several variants of the origin of the name, none of which, however, is generally accepted: 
- from the hypothetical name &quot;Serpoch&quot; (derived from &quot;Serp&quot;) with suffix -;
- from the name of the River Serpeiki;
- from the sickle plant;
- from the fact that the River Serpeika sickly skirted the Cathedral (Red) mountain;
- from the fact that sickles were forged in the vicinity of the city;
- from the canonical name Serapion;
- different versions of the Finno-Ugric origin and other versions.

==History==
Serpukhov was established in 1339 to protect the southern approaches to Moscow. Two years later it was made a seat of the powerful princedom ruled by a cousin and close associate of Dmitry Donskoy, Vladimir the Bold. Town status was granted to it in 1374. The princedom continued until 1456, when the last prince escaped to Lithuania. The town frequently fell prey to the hordes of Tokhtamysh, Crimean Tatars, and other steppe conquerors. It was necessary to protect it with a stone citadel, or kremlin, which was completed by 1556 as part of the Great Abatis Belt.

Located on the Oka frontiers and serving as a fortress during the long struggle with the Mongol-Tatar and Lithuanian-Polish conquerors, Serpukhov, for a long time, remained a reliable outpost of the Moscow Principality. The Serpukhov principality, led by Prince Vladimir Brave, participated in the Battle of Kulikov. It was here that Tsar Ivan IV once conducted a large look at his military forces, here stood the camp of Boris Godunov with &quot;rat people&quot;, in Serpukhov collected regiments &quot;for the enemy of his Crimean tsar&quot; Vasily Shuisky. One of the strongholds was the city for the peasant army of Ivan Bolotnikov.

In the mid-16th century Serpukhov maintained the role of an important strategic, administrative and economic center, experienced a revival in crafts and trade. The city consisted of three parts: the Kremlin, the posada and the suburb. Historically, Serpukhov&#x27;s urban districts were formed from monastic suburbs and factory huts, and have been merged into a single whole already now.

===Medieval period===

There is no written evidence of Serpukhov&#x27;s existence in the Domangol era. However, as a result of archaeological research of Serpukhovsky fortification, conducted in 1926-1927 by A.N. Voronkov, numerous remains of ceramics, glass, iron products of the 10th and 13th centuries were found. On the site of the fortification between the rivers Nara and Serpeika at the mouth of the last in the 14th century, there was already a city.

The first mention of Serpukhov in written sources is the spiritual letter of Ivan Kalita. In the will of the Moscow prince, the city is presented as one of his possessions. The text of the document exists in two versions with different dating. There are several opinions about the date of the will:

According to L. V. Cherepnin, both copies of the spiritual lettering were drawn up before Ivan Kalita&#x27;s fourth trip to Orda in 1339.
According to A. A. Simin, the document was created earlier than 1331 - either in 1327 or in 1328.
A. V. Kuchkin believes that one copy of the will was made in 1336 (during the third trip of the prince to Orda), and the other - after this event.
The official date from which the age of the city is counted is 1339, according to the first version.

According to spiritual literacy, the third son of Ivan Kalita Andrei Ivanovich inherited part of the land of the Moscow Principality, including Serpukhov, which became the center of the parish, and in the future - the basis of the new specific principality. In the middle of the 14th century, an epidemic of the plague, known as the &quot;Black Death&quot;, swept across Europe. Prince Andrew fell to one of her victims in 1353. The deal is inherited by Prince Vladimir Andreevich. During the age of the prince&#x27;s possessions are run by influential boyars. At this time in the history of the city is a significant event - Moscow Metropolitan Alexis in 1360 on the right bank of Nara founded the Monastery of The Lord. In 1367, in order to settle relations between Vladimir and his cousin Dmitry signed a contract, which confirms the subordination of the first second, as well as the right of Vladimir Andreevich to his fate and duties in relation to the Moscow prince. 
Soon Vladimir begins to pay considerable attention to the development of his possessions. Since the 1370s, Serpukhov has been building a period of active construction. So in 1374, according to the chronicles on the Red (Cathedral) mountain begins the construction of a wooden kremlin, the city appointed the viceroy of the prince - Yakov Yuryevich Novosylets, established benefits to attract traders and artisans. In the same year, on the site of the Domongolian Slavic settlement of the High on the left bank of Nara, south of the Red Mountain, Prince Vladimir Andreevich founded a monastery named Vysotsky. The laying and consecration of the monastery was carried out by Sergiy Radonezki. Serpukhov&#x27;s military, political and economic importance is growing, around which a full-fledged principality is formed, the core of which became parishes with centers in Lopasna, Darker and Rostovets. Since the end of the 14th century, the Serpukhov prince has been chasing his own coins.

As the main ally of Prince Dmitry (and part-time cousin), Vladimir help participate in the events of 1380. Serpukhov becomes one of the centers of preparation for the campaign against Mamaya. The Serpukhov militia, led by Prince Vladimir Brave, operates as part of the Ambush Regiment in the Battle of Kulikov, which was a turning point in Russian history. In honor of the victory in 1381, a stone cathedral and a church with a refectory are being built in the Vysotsky Monastery. Soon Serpukhov was ruined during a campaign to Moscow by Khan Tokhtamish (1382). There is an opinion that the Ordyn army deviated from the direct route to Moscow in order to commit an act of revenge for the participation of the local prince and militia in the Battle of Kulikov.

1389 was marked by feudal conflict: Vladimir severed relations with the Moscow prince, who did not satisfy the demands of his cousin for new possessions. At the height of the quarrel, the grand prince captured the boyar of Serpukhov&#x27;s prince, Vladimir, in turn, carried out the seizure of land belonging to Dmitry. The quarrel ended with the signing of another contract between feudal lords.

In the 15th century Serpukhov was twice ruined: in 1408 by the army of Edigea and in 1409 by Lithuanians under the leadership of Prince Svidrigailo. After the death of Vladimir the Brave in 1410, the principality was divided between five sons. Serpukhov went to the eldest - Ivan Vladimirovich. Later, Vladimir&#x27;s descendants participated in feudal wars on the side of The Moscow Princes until the independent principality was liquidated in 1456, when Prince Vasily Yaroslavich, grandson of Vladimir the Brave, was imprisoned. Serpukhovsky brigade as part of the Moscow army participated in the campaign to Novgorod in 1478, and in 1480 in standing on the Egre.

===Period between the Tatar-Mongolian yoke and the Time of Troubles===

Between 1496-1502, the former Kazan khan Mohammad-Amin of the Ulu-Muhammad dynasty, who was given Serpukhov, Hatun, and Kashira, was in the service of the Moscow ruler. This period in the history of the city is characterized by the oppression of local residents and violence by the henchman Ivan III. The next time Serpukhov was fed in 1532-1533 at another exiled Khan from Kazan, Shigale, who belonged to the Astrakhan dynasty of the Kasimov rulers. Shigalei, who was found to be in contact with Kazan, who violated feeding conditions, was exiled to Beloozeroin January 1533.

From the end of the 15th century, a period of grueling raids of Crimean Tatars, who were dependent on the Ottoman Empire, began. The main of their routes to Moscow was Muravsky nobility, who walked from Perekop to Tula between the upper rivers of two basins - Dnipro and North Donets. A key element of the system of protection against raids was a line of fortifications along the banks of the Oki, where up to 65,000 warriors, annually assembled in Moscow, were held in the deep autumn. The most important part of the line of protective structures was the Tarus-Serpukhov-Kashir-Kolomna section. Thus, in 1512 there was a threat of a breakthrough of the Crimeans to Moscow, and in Serpukhov were concentrated troops led by The brother of Vasily III, Yuri Ivanovich, which became a barrier on the way of nomads to the capital. Five years later, in 1517, the Russian army stood up to the enemy. As a result of this campaign, the enemy was defeated the losses of the Crimeans amounted to 15,000 people. The campaign of Mehmed I Girey in 1521 led to the ruin of Serpukhov, Borovsk, Kashira and the central counties of the state. The result of the disaster was the decision of Basil III on the construction of stone fortresses on the southern borders. In 1556, the construction of the white-stone Serpukhov Kremlin. In the same year in Serpukhov Ivan IV held a large viewing of serving people.

In 1565, after Tsar Ivan the Terrible divided the Russian state into an oprichnina and the land, the city became part of the last. With the construction of the new fortress Serpukhov increases its role in the defensive system and since 1572 the Grand Regiment of the Russian Army has been located here.

In 1571 there was a campaign of The Virgin I Giret. In April, the Crimean army crossed the Oma in the area of Orla, and in May it was already near Serpukhov, where the Volynsky detachment was defeated by J. F. Vosodo, led by Ivan IV, but could not gain a foothold in it. As a result, a retreat to Moscow was undertaken, the tsar fled to the Alexandrov suburb. Devlet I besieged Moscow and burned it. On the way back, the Crimeans ravaged several counties, including Serpukhovsky. Crimean troops in the described campaign were helped by traitors, among whom was Serpukhovich Rusin, one of the children of the Boyar Shishkins. In 1572, Devlet I Girey prepared a second raid on the Russian state. A regiment of up to 10,000 men was sent to meet the enemy, led by Prince Mikhail Vorotynsky, who was stationed in Serpukhov. On June 25, 1572, the Crimean army approached Eke. Crossing the river and breaking several guard Russian detachments, the 120,000-year-old army of Devlet Gireya headed to Moscow. Vorotynsky organized the pursuit of the advancing troops, which ended with a convincing victory of the Russians in the Battle of the Young.

The last breakthrough of the Crimean Tatars to Moscow dates back to 1581, when the army of Gaza II Gireya, crossing under Serpukhov through Alone and destroying the city plantation, moved to Moscow, where it failed and was pushed south. The leadership of the Russian army was conducted from Serpukhov by the tsarist governors. Boris Godunovtook an active part in the persecution of Gaza. This moment was one of the key moments in his political ascent.

A significant event in history was the Serpukhov campaign of Godunov in 1598. The Russian army, which came to meet the Tatars, was located on the shore of Oki near Serpukhov. Boris Godunov&#x27;s camp is located in a meadow near the Vlad monastery. Several weeks in a row were conducted inspections of troops and demonstration of force in front of the enemy. As a result, the ambassadors of Gaza Gireya recognized Godunov&#x27;s royal title and passed offers of friendship and peace. By this time, significant donations to local monasteries on the part of the king, which began stone construction. The Temple of the Great Martyr George the Victorious, the Gated Temple of the Martyr Theod of Ankirsky and the wall of the Lord&#x27;s Monastery were built.

===Time of Troubles===
The famine of 1601, the increase in the number of robber gangs, the uprising of peasants in 1603 did not bypass Serpukhovsky county. In a heated environment, false Dmitry I is on a trip to Moscow. In May 1605 the population of Serpukhov accepts False Dmitry I as king. The imposter&#x27;s army, preparing to enter the capital, sets up a camp near the Monastery of The Lord.

After the murder of False Dmitry I and the election of Vasily Shuisky by Tsar in 1606, Serpukhov again housed a large regiment of the tsarist army, the city became the center from which the siege of southern cities, not controlled by the official authorities, was under control. At this time, the uprising led by Ivan Bolotnikov was gaining momentum. After the Battle of Krom, the rebels advanced to Moscow, taking Kaluga and Alexin along the way. In October 1606, Bolotnikov approached Serpukhov, and the locals voluntarily surrendered the city. As a result of the unsuccessful assault of the capital, the rebels retreated to Serpukhov and then to Kaluga. In the summer of 1607, Serpukhov once again became a base for the tsarist army, which on July 5–7 participated in the battle on the River Eight between Serpukhov and Kashira, where the rebels were defeated. On June 21, Shui&#x27;s captive rebels were tried here. In honor of the victory of the Lord&#x27;s Monastery, the king was presented with a miraculous image of St. Dimitri Uglichsky, placed in a specially constructed aisle in the Vvedensky Cathedral (later attached to the Temple of the Great Martyr George the Victorious).

During the Polish intervention, Serpukhov also did not escape military action. In January 1610 near the city a detachment of Cossacks led by Bezzubtsev defeated the Poles of Mlotsky. Soon the Cossacks left Serpukhov, who the next night was occupied by Poles. As a result, a large part of the civilian population was burnt down and a large part of the civilian population was killed.

In 1610-1611, the residents of Serpukhov participated in the First Land Militia of Lyapunov, in 1612 - in the Second Militia of Minin and Pozharsky.

As a result of the weakening of the state, which occurred during the Troubles, the nomads were again able to attack cities in Central Russia.

In 1613, Serpukhovsky County was ruined by the Nogai Tatars along with Borovsky and Kolomensky.

In 1618, hetman Piotr Sagaidachny, anally of the Polish king Vladislav, retreating with the army from Moscow to Kaluga, burned the Serpukhovsky plantation, but the fortress could not take. In 1633, the neighborhood of Serpukhov was ruined by the Crimean Tatars.

===17th Century===

The consequences of the events of the Troubles for Serpukhov were a sharp decline in the population and the decline of the economy. Residents, trying to reduce the tax burden, move to the monastic suburbs. The state forcibly, by the forces of a detective order, returns the population to the city plantation.

During the 17th century, Serpukhov continued to play the role of an important military center. At the beginning of the century the fortress survived a fire, after which it was restored and expanded. The head of the city administration at this time is appointed for a period of one to three years governor. In 1633, the urban suburbs of Serpukhov were ravaged by the Crimean army of Prince Mubarak-Gerai, who could not take the city Kremlin, however. In the &quot;rebel age&quot; the unrest could not bypass Serpukhov. In 1648, peasant riots engulfed the county. The estate of Kryvtsov&#x27;s boyar son was burned down. As a result of the adoption in 1649 of the Council&#x27;s settlement, the population reversed from monasteries to planting, which leads to the growth of the city and its population by 70-80%. In 1669 there is a big fire, Serpukhov burns almost to the ground.

The main occupations of Serpukhov&#x27;s population in the 17th century: iron production, blacksmithing, pottery, shoe production, food, clothing. More than 40 people were engaged in trade outside Serpukhov. The 17th century is also characterized by the rise of stone construction in the city. In different years were built: the Church of Nikola (on the site of the current cathedral), the gated Three-Sacred Church, the walls and towers of the Monastery, the Baroque Church, the church of Athanasius Athos (disassembled in 1878), the new building of the Trinity Cathedral. In 1627, the Cathedral of conception was rebuilt in the Vysotsky Monastery.

===18th Century===

In Petrov&#x27;s times, the population of Serpukhov actively participated in the construction of the fleet, new cities, and fortresses. Local craftsmen were made to participate in the king&#x27;s projects. In the third decade of the 18th century, Serpukhov became one of the largest cities in the suburbs. Blacksmith production is being phased out. Trade is developing. In 1708, Serpukhov was part of the Moscow province formed. In the 1730s, one after another, linen factories began to open. In the forties, the main ones are the enterprises of Vasily and Nikolai Kishkin (the largest in the city), Vasily, Stepan and Ivan Gerasimovich Serikov, Ivan Andreevich Serikov. By the sixties, Ivan Andreevich Serikov&#x27;s company was taking the leading position in Serpukhov. In addition to linen, silk and cloth factories were also opened in the city.

In 1761, 30% of the sails exported from Russia were of Serpkhov&#x27;s origin. The city comes in fourth place in Russia in linen production after Yaroslavl, Kostroma and Moscow. The number of people employed in the textile industry is growing from 3,000 in the 1950s to 5,500 at the end of the century.

In addition to textiles in Serpukhov in the 80s there are eight tanners, seven brick and nine malt factories. The main areas of trade are the port of St. Petersburg (textile, leather), Moscow (food products).

===19th Century===
In 1812, the population of Serpukhov and the county participated in the defense of the Russian Empire following the French invasion of Russia in 1812. The militia of the Moscow province consisted of 2,246 residents of Serpukhov county. The war did not affect the city directly. The industry continued to produce most of the canvas produced in the region. At that time there were 14 factories with 855 textile mills in Serpukhov. During this period, the industry is reoriented to the production of cotton products. If in 1812 the first cotton enterprise of Alexey Ignatieff appeared in the city, in 1814 eleven factories were functioning. The largest of them were the enterprises of A. Serikov, Ignatius Shilkin, I. Serikov, Maxim Konshin. There were also three tannery factories in Serpukhov, and a paper factory was operating in the Alexandrov suburb (now the village of Borisovo).

Between 1810 and 1840, the number of people employed in urban enterprises increased to five thousand, with 950 employees employed in suburban factories in the fence, and the number of workers in other enterprises in the county to 2,000. The largest factories are owned by the Families of Konshin and Tretyakov. The leading industry of the Serpukhov industry is the production of cotton products. Thus, 4500 people are employed in seven paper-weaving and sitzenabive enterprises, 493 people are employed in ten linen. The main products of the industry: sith, mitkal, padded headscarves, canvas.

Between 1840 and 1860, Serpukhov experienced a period of intense industrial growth. By the mid-1850s, the number of people employed in the city&#x27;s enterprises reached 8,500, along with the suburbs - 10,400 people. In the rest of the county, the number of workers has been reduced to one thousand, indicating an increase in the territorial concentration of production. The average size of cotton mills has grown from 487 to 742 since 1843, bringing the total number of people employed in the industry to 8,900. The leaders of the Serpukhov industry were the enterprises of N.M. Konshin (later transformed by his son into the N. N. Konshin), which owned the paper-tinget and sitzenabative factory &quot;Old Cape&quot; (founded by Maxim Konshin in 1814), spinning enterprise (opened in the north of the city in 1846), a paper office The New Cape weaving factory (opened in the late 1850s near the village of Glazechnya) made up the complex, which allowed to perform a full cycle of processing from spinning raw materials to finished padded products. Other sub-sectors of the textile industry include the hornets operating in Serpukhov at the same time. The production of the canvas by the middle of the 19th century is in decline: the four remaining factories in 1843 employed 126 people. From a technical point of view, Serpukhov&#x27;s enterprises of that time were not highly developed: most of them used manual labor, as a motor force used horse drive and water wheels. In the 1850s, steam engines appeared.

Trade was an important part of the urban economy of the first half and mid-19th century. In the volume of trade operations Serpukhov took the second place in the province after Kolomna. The key trade routes were the road connecting Kharkiv with Moscow and the waterway along the Ska. The main items of trade - bread, wood, textiles. A significant role in the life of the city was occupied by craft production, which by 1861 employed more than 600 people. Key craft professions of the time: bakers, butchers, cobblers, tailors, fashionistas, blacksmiths, carpenters, carvers, stoves.

In October 1941, the front line came close to the city. In the Serpukhov direction, the German-fascist troops were on the offensive as part of the 13th Army Corps, the 4th Field Army and the Motorized Units of the 2nd Guderian Tank Group. Defensive positions west of Serpukhov were occupied by the 49th Army of the Western Front under the command of Lieutenant General Saharkin, whose name is currently one of the city streets.

==Symbolism==

Based on the results of N.A. Soboleva&#x27;s research, the main version of Serpukhov&#x27;s coat of arms is the following. Serpukhov&#x27;s coat of arms was designed by his friend (deputy) heroldmaster Franz Matveevich Santi in the mid-1720s. A questionnaire has been sent to the cities of Russia in order to obtain information that can be taken into account when creating the coat of arms for each particularcity. The peacock became an element of the coat of arms on the basis of a message sent to the heroldy from Serpukhov, which said that not far from the city &quot;in the monastery one peacocks will be born&quot;.

The first coat of arms of the city was approved simultaneously with other coats of arms of the cities of the Moscow province on December 20, 1781. It was subsequently reviewed four times. The first time the coat of arms was changed on March 16, 1883, in accordance with the rules developed by Bernhard Vasilyevich Koene and introduced in 1857 with the rules of the city&#x27;s coats of arms. In Soviet times, Stepan Marukhin developed a new coat of arms, approved on May 30, 1967. On July 2, 1992, a version of the coat of arms from 1883 was restored. The current version was approved on 6 October 1999 and is listed on the State Heraldic Register of the Russian Federation under No.564. It is based on the coat of arms, approved in 1883, which includes the coat of arms of 1781.

<text>Djuna Barnes ( ; June 12, 1892 – June 18, 1982) was an American artist, illustrator, journalist, and writer who is perhaps best known for her novel &quot;Nightwood&quot; (1936), a cult classic of lesbian fiction and an important work of modernist literature.

In 1913, Barnes began her career as a freelance journalist and illustrator for the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;. By early 1914, Barnes was a highly sought feature reporter, interviewer, and illustrator whose work appeared in the city&#x27;s leading newspapers and periodicals. Later, Barnes&#x27;s talent and connections with prominent Greenwich Village bohemians afforded her the opportunity to publish her prose, poems, illustrations, and one-act plays in both avant-garde literary journals and popular magazines, and publish an illustrated volume of poetry, &quot;The Book of Repulsive Women&quot; (1915).

In 1921, a lucrative commission with &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; took Barnes to Paris, where she lived for the next 10 years. In this period she published &quot;A Book&quot; (1923), a collection of poetry, plays, and short stories, which was later reissued, with the addition of three stories, as &quot;A Night Among the Horses&quot; (1929), &quot;Ladies Almanack&quot; (1928), and &quot;Ryder&quot; (1928).

During the 1930s, Barnes spent time in England, Paris, New York, and North Africa. It was during this restless time that she wrote and published &quot;Nightwood&quot;. In October 1939, after nearly two decades living mostly in Europe, Barnes returned to New York. She published her last major work, the verse play &quot;The Antiphon&quot;, in 1958, and she died in her apartment at Patchin Place, Greenwich Village in June 1982.

==Life and writing==

===Early life (1892–1912)===

Barnes was born in a log cabin on Storm King Mountain, near Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York. Her paternal grandmother Zadel Barnes was a writer, journalist, and Women&#x27;s Suffrage activist who had once hosted an influential literary salon. Her father, Wald Barnes (born Henry Aaron Budington), was an unsuccessful composer, musician, and painter. An advocate of polygamy, he married Barnes&#x27;s mother Elizabeth J. Barnes (née Chappell) in 1889; his mistress Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Clark moved in with them in 1897, when Barnes was five. They had eight children (five from Elizabeth: sons Thurn, Zendon, Saxon and Shangar and daughter Djuna; four from Fanny: sons Duane and Brian and daughters Muriel and Sheila), whom Wald made little effort to support financially. One half-sibling died in childhood. Zadel, who believed her son was a misunderstood artistic genius, struggled to provide for the entire family, supplementing her diminishing income by writing begging letters to friends and acquaintances.

As the second oldest child, Barnes spent much of her childhood helping care for siblings and half-siblings. She received her early education at home, mostly from her father and grandmother, who taught her writing, art, and music but neglected subjects such as math and spelling. She claimed to have had no formal schooling at all; some evidence suggests that she was enrolled in public school for a time after age ten, though her attendance was inconsistent.

It is possible that at the age of 16 she was raped, either by a neighbor with the knowledge and consent of her father, or possibly by her father. However, these are rumors and unconfirmed by Barnes, who never managed to complete her autobiography. What is known is that Barnes and her father continued to write warm letters to one another until his death in 1934. Barnes does refer to a rape obliquely in her first novel &quot;Ryder&quot; and more directly in her furious final play &quot;The Antiphon&quot;. Sexually explicit references in correspondence from her grandmother, with whom she shared a bed for years, suggest incest, or overly familiar teasing, but Zadel—dead for 40 years by the time &quot;The Antiphon&quot; was written—was left out of its indictments. Shortly before her 18th birthday she reluctantly &quot;married&quot; Fanny Clark&#x27;s brother Percy Faulkner in a private ceremony without benefit of clergy. He was 52. The match had been strongly promoted by her father, grandmother, mother, and brother, but she stayed with him for no more than two months.

===New York City (1912–1921)===
In 1912 Barnes&#x27;s family, facing financial ruin, split up. Elizabeth moved to New York City with Barnes and three of her brothers, then filed for divorce, freeing Wald to marry Fanny Clark. The move gave Barnes an opportunity to study art formally for the first time; she attended the Pratt Institute for about six months from 1912 to 1913 and at the Art Student&#x27;s League of New York from 1915 to 1916, but the need to support herself and her family—a burden that fell largely on her—soon drove her to leave school and take a job as a reporter at the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;. Upon arriving at the &quot;Daily Eagle&quot;, Barnes declared, &quot;I can draw and write, and you&#x27;d be a fool not to hire me&quot;, words that were inscribed inside the Brooklyn Museum.

Over the next few years her work appeared in almost every newspaper in New York, including the &quot;New York Press&quot;, &quot;The World&quot; and &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;; she wrote interviews, features, theatre reviews, and a variety of news stories, often illustrating them with her own drawings. She also published short fiction in the &quot;New York Morning Telegraph&quot;″s Sunday supplement and in the pulp magazine &quot;All-Story Cavalier Weekly&quot;.

Much of Barnes&#x27;s journalism foregrounds the subjective and experiential view. Writing about a conversation with James Joyce, she admitted to missing part of what he said because her attention had wandered, though she revered Joyce&#x27;s writing. Interviewing the successful playwright Donald Ogden Stewart, she shouted at him for &quot;roll[ing] over and find[ing] yourself famous&quot; while other writers continued to struggle, then said she wouldn&#x27;t mind dying; as her biographer Phillip Herring points out, this is &quot;a depressing and perhaps unprecedented note on which to end an interview.&quot; For &quot;The Girl and the Gorilla&quot;, published by &quot;New York World Magazine&quot; in October 1914 she has a conversation with Dinah, a female gorilla at the Bronx Zoo.

For another article in &quot;New York World&quot; in 1914, she submitted to force-feeding, a technique then being used on hunger-striking suffragists. Barnes wrote &quot;If I, play acting, felt my being burning with revolt at this brutal usurpation of my own functions, how they who actually suffered the ordeal in its acutest horror must have flamed at the violation of the sanctuaries of their spirits.&quot; She concluded &quot;I had shared the greatest experience of the bravest of my sex.&quot;

While she mocked conservative suffrage activist Carrie Chapman Catt when Catt admonished would-be suffrage orators never to &quot;hold a militant pose&quot;, or wear &quot;a dress that shows your feet in front&quot;, Barnes was supportive of progressive suffragists. Barnes suggested that Catt&#x27;s conservatism was an obstacle to the suffrage movement when Catt tried to ostracize fellow suffragists Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, who sought the vote for women through media attention directed at their strikes and non-violent protesting. It was their mistreatment that motivated Barnes to experience for herself the torture of being force-fed.

Barnes immersed herself in risky situations in order to access experiences that a previous generation of homebound women had been denied. Writing about the traditionally masculine domain of boxing from the ringside, Barnes explored boxing as a window into women&#x27;s modern identities. In 1914, she first posed the question &quot;What do women want at a fight?&quot; in an article titled &quot;My Sisters and I at a New York Prizefight&quot; published in &quot;New York World&quot; magazine. According to Irene Gammel, &quot;Barnes&#x27; essay effectively begins to unravel an entire cultural history of repression for women&quot;. Barnes&#x27;s interest in boxing continued into 1915 when she interviewed heavyweight champion Jess Willard.
In 1915 Barnes moved out of her family&#x27;s flat to an apartment in Greenwich Village, where she entered a thriving Bohemian community of artists and writers. Among her social circle were Edmund Wilson, Berenice Abbott, and the Dadaist artist and poet Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, whose biography Barnes tried to write but never finished. She came into contact with Guido Bruno, an entrepreneur and promoter who published magazines and chapbooks from his garret on Washington Square. Bruno had a reputation for unscrupulousness, and was often accused of exploiting Greenwich Village residents for profit—he used to charge tourists admission to watch Bohemians paint—but he was a strong opponent of censorship and was willing to risk prosecution by publishing Barnes&#x27;s 1915 collection of &quot;rhythms and drawings&quot;

Despite a description of sex between women in the first poem, the book was never legally challenged; the passage seems explicit now, but at a time when lesbianism was virtually invisible in American culture, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice may not have understood its imagery. Others were not as naïve, and Bruno was able to cash in on the book&#x27;s reputation by raising the price from fifteen to fifty cents and pocketing the difference. Twenty years later Barnes used Bruno as one of the models for Felix Volkbein in &quot;Nightwood&quot;, caricaturing his pretensions to nobility and his habit of bowing down before anyone titled or important.

Barnes was a member of the Provincetown Players, an amateur theatrical collective whose emphasis on artistic rather than commercial success meshed well with her own values. The Players&#x27; Greenwich Village theater was a converted stable with bench seating and a tiny stage; according to Barnes it was &quot;always just about to be given back to the horses.&quot; Yet it played a significant role in the development of American drama, featuring works by Susan Glaspell, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Wallace Stevens, and Theodore Dreiser, as well as launching the career of Eugene O&#x27;Neill. Three one-act plays by Barnes were produced there in 1919 and 1920; a fourth, &quot;The Dove&quot;, premiered at Smith College in 1925, and a series of short closet dramas were published in magazines, some under Barnes&#x27;s pseudonym Lydia Steptoe.

These plays show the strong influence of the Irish playwright J. M. Synge; she was drawn to both the poetic quality of Synge&#x27;s language and the pessimism of his vision. Critics have found them derivative, particularly those in which she tried to imitate Synge&#x27;s Irish dialect, and Barnes may have agreed, since in later years she dismissed them as mere juvenilia. Yet in their content, these stylized and enigmatic early plays are more experimental than those of her fellow playwrights at Provincetown. A &quot;New York Times&quot; review by Alexander Woollcott of her play &quot;Three From the Earth&quot; called it a demonstration of &quot;how absorbing and essentially dramatic a play can be without the audience ever knowing what, if anything, the author is driving at ... The spectators sit with bated breath listening to each word of a playlet of which the darkly suggested clues leave the mystery unsolved.&quot;

Greenwich Village in the 1910s was known for its atmosphere of sexual as well as intellectual freedom. Barnes was unusual among Villagers in having been raised with a philosophy of free love, espoused both by her grandmother and her father. Her father&#x27;s idiosyncratic vision had included a commitment to unlimited procreation, which she strongly rejected; criticism of childbearing would become a major theme in her work. She did, however, retain sexual freedom as a value. In the 1930s she told Antonia White that &quot;she had no feeling of guilt whatever about sex, about going to bed with any man or woman she wanted&quot;; correspondence indicates that by the time she was 21 her family was well aware of her bisexuality, and she had a number of affairs with both men and women during her Greenwich Village years.

Of these, the most important was probably her engagement to Ernst Hanfstaengl, a Harvard graduate who ran the American branch of his family&#x27;s art publishing house. Hanfstaengl had once given a piano concert at the White House and was a friend of then-New York State Senator Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but he became increasingly angered by anti-German sentiment in the United States during World War I. In 1916, he told Barnes he wanted a German wife; the painful breakup became the basis of a deleted scene in &quot;Nightwood&quot;. He later returned to Germany and became a close associate of Adolf Hitler. Starting in 1916 or 1917, she lived with a socialist philosopher and critic named Courtenay Lemon, whom she referred to as her common-law husband, but this too ended, for reasons that are unclear. She also had a passionate romantic relationship with Mary Pyne, a reporter for the &quot;New York Press&quot; and fellow member of the Provincetown Players. Pyne died of tuberculosis in 1919, attended by Barnes until the end.

===Paris (1921–1930)===

In the 1920s, Paris was the center of modernism in art and literature. Barnes first traveled there in 1921 on an assignment for &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;. She interviewed her fellow expatriate writers and artists for U.S. periodicals and soon became a well-known figure on the local scene; her black cloak and her acerbic wit are remembered in many memoirs of the time. Even before her first novel was published, her literary reputation was already high, largely on the strength of her story &quot;A Night Among the Horses&quot;, which was published in &quot;The Little Review&quot; and reprinted in her 1923 collection &quot;A Book&quot;. She was part of the inner circle of the influential salon hostess Natalie Barney, who became a lifelong friend and patron, as well as the central figure in Barnes&#x27;s satiric chronicle of Paris lesbian life, &quot;Ladies Almanack.&quot; The most important relationship of Barnes&#x27;s Paris years was with the artist Thelma Wood. Wood was a Kansas native who had come to Paris to become a sculptor, but at Barnes&#x27;s suggestion took up silverpoint instead, producing drawings of animals and plants that one critic compared to Henri Rousseau. By the winter of 1922 they had set up housekeeping together in a flat on the Boulevard Saint-Germain. Another close friendship that developed during this time was with the Dada artist Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, with whom Barnes began an intensive correspondence in 1923. &quot;Where Wood gave Barnes a doll as a gift to represent their symbolic love child, the Baroness proposed an erotic marriage whose love-child would be their book.&quot; From Paris, Barnes supported the Baroness in Berlin with money, clothing, and magazines. She also collected the Baroness&#x27;s poems and letters.
Barnes arrived in Paris with a letter of introduction to James Joyce, whom she interviewed for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and who became a friend. The headline of her &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; interview billed him as &quot;the man who is, at present, one of the more significant figures in literature,&quot; but her personal reaction to &quot;Ulysses&quot; was less guarded: &quot;I shall never write another line ... Who has the nerve to after that?&quot; It may have been reading Joyce that led Barnes to turn away from the late 19th century Decadent and Aesthetic influences of &quot;The Book of Repulsive Women&quot; toward the modernist experimentation of her later work. They differed, however, on the proper subject of literature; Joyce thought writers should focus on commonplace subjects and make them extraordinary, while Barnes was always drawn to the unusual, even the grotesque. Then, too, her own life was an extraordinary subject. Her autobiographical first novel &quot;Ryder&quot; would not only present readers with the difficulty of deciphering its shifting literary styles—a technique inspired by &quot;Ulysses&quot;—but also with the challenge of piecing together the history of an unconventional polygamous household, far removed from most readers&#x27; expectations and experience.

Despite the difficulties of the text, &quot;Ryder&quot;″s bawdiness drew attention, and it briefly became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. Its popularity caught the publisher unprepared; a first edition of 3,000 sold out quickly, but by the time more copies made it into bookstores, public interest in the book had died down. Still, the advance allowed Barnes to buy a new apartment on Rue Saint-Romain, where she lived with Thelma Wood starting in September 1927. The move made them neighbors of Mina Loy, a friend of Barnes&#x27;s since Greenwich Village days, who appeared in &quot;Ladies Almanack&quot; as Patience Scalpel, the sole heterosexual character, who &quot;could not understand Women and their Ways.&quot;

Due to its subject matter, &quot;Ladies Almanack&quot; was published in a small, privately printed edition under the pseudonym &quot;A Lady of Fashion&quot;. Copies were sold on the streets of Paris by Barnes and her friends, and Barnes managed to smuggle a few into the United States to sell. A bookseller, Edward Titus, offered to carry &quot;Ladies Almanack&quot; in his store in exchange for being mentioned on the title page, but when he demanded a share of the royalties on the entire print run, Barnes was furious. She later gave the name Titus to the abusive father in &quot;The Antiphon&quot;.

Barnes dedicated &quot;Ryder&quot; and &quot;Ladies Almanack&quot; to Thelma Wood, but the year both books were published—1928—was also the year that she and Wood separated. Barnes had wanted their relationship to be monogamous, but had discovered that Wood wanted her &quot;along with the rest of the world.&quot; Wood had a worsening dependency on alcohol, and she spent her nights drinking and seeking out casual sex partners; Barnes would search the cafés for her, often winding up equally drunk. Barnes broke up with Wood over her involvement with heiress Henriette McCrea Metcalf (1888–1981), who would be scathingly portrayed in &quot;Nightwood&quot; as Jenny Petherbridge.

===1930s===
Much of &quot;Nightwood&quot; was written during the summers of 1932 and 1933, while Barnes was staying at Hayford Hall, a country manor in Devon rented by the art patron Peggy Guggenheim. Fellow guests included Antonia White, John Ferrar Holms, and the novelist and poet Emily Coleman. Evenings at the manor—nicknamed &quot;Hangover Hall&quot; by its residents—often featured a party game called Truth that encouraged brutal frankness, creating a tense emotional atmosphere. Barnes was afraid to leave her work in progress unattended because the volatile Coleman, having told Barnes one of her secrets, had threatened to burn the manuscript if Barnes revealed it. But once she had read the book, Coleman became its champion. Her critiques of successive drafts led Barnes to make major structural changes, and when publisher after publisher rejected the manuscript, it was Coleman who pressed T. S. Eliot, then an editor at Faber and Faber, to read it.

Faber published the book in 1936. Though reviews treated it as a major work of art, the book did not sell well. Barnes received no advance from Faber and the first royalty statement was for only £43; the U.S. edition published by Harcourt, Brace the following year fared no better. Barnes had published little journalism in the 1930s and was largely dependent on Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s financial support. She was constantly ill and drank more and more heavily—according to Guggenheim, she accounted for a bottle of whiskey per day. In February 1939 she checked into a hotel in London and attempted suicide. Guggenheim funded hospital visits and doctors, but finally lost patience and sent her back to New York. There she shared a single room with her mother, who coughed all night and who kept reading her passages from Mary Baker Eddy, having converted to Christian Science. In March 1940, her family sent her to a sanatorium in upstate New York to dry out. Furious, Barnes began to plan a biography of her family, writing to Emily Coleman that &quot;there is no reason any longer why I should feel for them in any way but hate.&quot; This idea would eventually come to fruition in her play &quot;The Antiphon&quot;. After she returned to New York City, she quarreled bitterly with her mother and was thrown out on the street.

===Return to Greenwich Village (1940–1982)===

Left with nowhere else to go, Barnes stayed at Thelma Wood&#x27;s apartment while Wood was out of town, then spent two months on a working ranch in Arizona with Emily Coleman and Coleman&#x27;s lover Jake Scarborough. She returned to New York and, in September, moved into the small apartment at 5 Patchin Place in Greenwich Village where she would spend the last 41 years of her life. Throughout the 1940s, she continued to drink and wrote virtually nothing. Guggenheim, despite misgivings, provided her with a small stipend, and Coleman, who could ill afford it, sent US$20 per month (about $310 in 2011). In 1943, Barnes was included in Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s show &quot;Exhibition by 31 Women&quot; at the Art of This Century gallery in New York.
In 1946, she worked for Henry Holt as a manuscript reader, but her reports were invariably caustic, and she was fired.

In 1950, realizing that alcoholism had made it impossible for her to function as an artist, Barnes stopped drinking in order to begin work on her verse play &quot;The Antiphon&quot;. The play drew heavily on her own family history, and the writing was fueled by anger; she said &quot;I wrote &quot;The Antiphon&quot; with clenched teeth, and I noted that my handwriting was as savage as a dagger.&quot; When he read the play, her brother Thurn accused her of wanting &quot;revenge for something long dead and to be forgotten&quot;. Barnes, in the margin of his letter, described her motive as &quot;justice&quot;, and next to &quot;dead&quot; she inscribed, &quot;not dead&quot;.

After &quot;The Antiphon&quot;, Barnes returned to writing poetry, which she worked and reworked, producing as many as 500 drafts. She wrote eight hours per day despite a growing list of health problems, including arthritis so severe that she had difficulty even sitting at her typewriter or turning on her desk lamp. Many of these poems never were finalized, and only a few were published in her lifetime.

During her Patchin Place years, Barnes became a notorious recluse, intensely suspicious of anyone she did not know well. E.E. Cummings, who lived across the street, checked on her periodically by shouting out his window &quot;Are you still alive, Djuna?&quot; Bertha Harris put roses in her mailbox, but never succeeded in meeting her; Carson McCullers camped on her doorstep, but Barnes only called down &quot;Whoever is ringing this bell, please go the hell away.&quot; Anaïs Nin was an ardent fan of her work, especially &quot;Nightwood&quot;. She wrote to Barnes several times, inviting her to participate in a journal on women&#x27;s writing, but received no reply. Barnes remained contemptuous of Nin and would cross the street to avoid her. Barnes was angry that Nin had named a character Djuna, and when the feminist bookstore Djuna Books opened in Greenwich Village, Barnes called to demand that the name be changed. Barnes had a lifelong affection for poet Marianne Moore since she and Moore were young in the 1920s.

Although Barnes had other female lovers, in her later years she was known to claim &quot;I am not a lesbian; I just loved Thelma.&quot;

Barnes was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1961 and was awarded a senior fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1981.

Barnes was the last surviving member of the first generation of English-language modernists when she died in her home in New York on June 18, 1982, six days after her 90th birthday.

===&quot;The Book of Repulsive Women&quot;===

Barnes&#x27;s chapbook &quot;The Book of Repulsive Women&quot; (1915) collects eight &quot;rhythms&quot; and five drawings. The poems show the strong influence of late 19th century Decadence, and the style of the illustrations resembles Aubrey Beardsley&#x27;s. The setting is New York City, and the subjects are all women: a cabaret singer, a woman seen through an open window from the elevated train, and, in the last poem, the corpses of two suicides in the morgue. The book describes women&#x27;s bodies and sexuality in terms that have indeed struck many readers as repulsive, but, as with much of Barnes&#x27;s work, the author&#x27;s stance is ambiguous. Some critics read the poems as exposing and satirizing cultural attitudes toward women.

Barnes came to regard &quot;The Book of Repulsive Women&quot; as an embarrassment; she called the title &quot;idiotic&quot;, left it out of her curriculum vitae, and even burned copies. But because the copyright had never been registered, she was unable to prevent it from being republished, and it became one of her most reprinted works.

===&quot;Ryder&quot;===
Barnes&#x27;s novel &quot;Ryder&quot; (1928) draws heavily on her childhood experiences in Cornwall-on-Hudson. It covers 50 years of history of the Ryder family: Sophia Grieve Ryder, like Zadel a former salon hostess fallen into poverty; her idle son Wendell; his wife Amelia; his resident mistress Kate-Careless; and their children. Barnes appears as Wendell and Amelia&#x27;s daughter Julie. The story has a large cast and is told from a variety of points of view; some characters appear as the protagonist of a single chapter only to disappear from the text entirely. Fragments of the Ryder family chronicle are interspersed with children&#x27;s stories, songs, letters, poems, parables, and dreams. The book changes style from chapter to chapter, parodying writers from Chaucer to Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

Both &quot;Ryder&quot; and &quot;Ladies Almanack&quot; abandon the Beardsleyesque style of her drawings for &quot;The Book of Repulsive Women&quot; in favor of a visual vocabulary borrowed from French folk art. Several illustrations are closely based on the engravings and woodcuts collected by Pierre Louis Duchartre and René Saulnier in the 1926 book &quot;L&#x27;Imagerie Populaire&quot;—images that had been copied with variations since medieval times. The bawdiness of &quot;Ryder&quot; illustrations led the U.S. Postal Service to refuse to ship it, and several had to be left out of the first edition, including an image in which Sophia is seen urinating into a chamberpot and one in which Amelia and Kate-Careless sit by the fire knitting codpieces. Parts of the text were also expurgated. In an acerbic introduction, Barnes explained that the missing words and passages had been replaced with asterisks so that readers could see the &quot;havoc&quot; wreaked by censorship. A 1990 Dalkey Archive edition restored the missing drawings, but the original text was lost with the destruction of the manuscript in World War II.

===&quot;Ladies Almanack&quot;===
&quot;Ladies Almanack&quot; (1928) is a roman à clef about a predominantly lesbian social circle centering on Natalie Clifford Barney&#x27;s salon in Paris. It is written in an archaic, Rabelaisian style, with Barnes&#x27;s own illustrations in the style of Elizabethan woodcuts.

Clifford Barney appears as Dame Evangeline Musset, &quot;who was in her Heart one Grand Red Cross for the Pursuance, the Relief and the Distraction, of such Girls as in their Hinder Parts, and their Fore Parts, and in whatsoever Parts did suffer them most, lament Cruelly.&quot; &quot;[A] Pioneer and a Menace&quot; in her youth, Dame Musset has reached &quot;a witty and learned Fifty&quot;; she rescues women in distress, dispenses wisdom, and upon her death is elevated to sainthood. Also appearing pseudonymously are Élisabeth de Gramont, Romaine Brooks, Dolly Wilde, Radclyffe Hall and her partner Una Troubridge, Janet Flanner and Solita Solano, and Mina Loy.

The obscure language, inside jokes, and ambiguity of &quot;Ladies Almanack&quot; have kept critics arguing about whether it is an affectionate satire or a bitter attack, but Barnes loved the book and reread it throughout her life.

===&quot;Nightwood&quot;===
Barnes&#x27;s reputation as a writer was made when &quot;Nightwood&quot; was published in England in 1936 in an expensive edition by Faber and Faber, and in the United States in 1937 by Harcourt, Brace and Company, with an added introduction by T.S. Eliot, Barnes&#x27;s editor. The avant-garde novel, written under the patronage of Peggy Guggenheim, made Barnes famous in feminist circles.

The novel, set in Paris in the 1920s, revolves around the lives of five characters, two of whom are based on Barnes and Wood, and it reflects the circumstances surrounding the ending of their relationship. In his introduction, Eliot praises Barnes&#x27;s style, which, while having &quot;prose rhythm ... and the musical pattern which is not that of verse, is so good a novel that only sensibilities trained on poetry can wholly appreciate it.&quot;

Due to concerns about censorship, Eliot edited &quot;Nightwood&quot; to soften some language relating to sexuality and religion. An edition restoring these changes, edited by Cheryl J. Plumb, was published by Dalkey Archive Press in 1995.

Dylan Thomas described &quot;Nightwood&quot; as &quot;one of the three great prose books ever written by a woman,&quot; and William Burroughs called it &quot;one of the great books of the twentieth century.&quot; It was number 12 on a list of the top 100 gay books compiled by The Publishing Triangle in 1999.

===&quot;The Antiphon&quot;===
Barnes&#x27;s verse play &quot;The Antiphon&quot; (1958) is set in England in 1939. Jeremy Hobbs, in disguise as Jack Blow, has brought his family together at their ruined ancestral home, Burley Hall. His motive is never explicitly stated, but he seems to want to provoke a confrontation among the members of his family and force them to confront the truth about their past. His sister Miranda is a stage actress, now &quot;out of patron and of money&quot;; her materialistic brothers, Elisha and Dudley, see her as a threat to their financial well-being. Elisha and Dudley accuse their mother Augusta of complicity with their abusive father Titus Hobbs. They take advantage of Jeremy&#x27;s absence to don animal masks and assault both women, making cruel and sexually suggestive remarks; Augusta treats this attack as a game. Jeremy returns with a doll house, a miniature version of the house in America where the children grew up. As she examines it, he charges her with making herself &quot;a madam by submission&quot; because she failed to prevent Titus from orchestrating Miranda&#x27;s rape by &quot;a travelling Cockney thrice [her] age.&quot; The last act finds Miranda and Augusta alone together. Augusta, at once disapproving and envious of her daughter&#x27;s more liberated life, exchanges clothes with her daughter and wants to pretend she is young again, but Miranda refuses to enter into this play. When Augusta hears Elisha and Dudley driving away, she blames Miranda for their abandonment and beats her to death with a curfew bell, falling dead at her side from the exertion.

The play premiered in 1961 in Stockholm in a Swedish translation by Karl Ragnar Gierow and U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld.

The play was translated into French and set at the Odeon Theater in Paris by the &quot;Comedie Française&quot; in March 1990.

===&quot;Creatures in an Alphabet&quot;===
Barnes&#x27;s last book, &quot;Creatures in an Alphabet&quot; (1982), is a collection of short rhyming poems. The format suggests a children&#x27;s book, but it contains enough allusiveness and advanced vocabulary to make it an unlikely read for a child: the entry for T quotes Blake&#x27;s &quot;The Tyger&quot;, a seal is compared to Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s portrait of Madame Récamier, and a braying donkey is described as &quot;practicing &quot;solfeggio&quot;.&quot; &quot;Creatures&quot; continues the themes of nature and culture found in Barnes&#x27;s earlier work, and their arrangement as a bestiary reflects her longstanding interest in systems for organizing knowledge, such as encyclopedias and almanacs.

===Unpublished non-fiction===
During the 1920s and 1930s, Barnes made an effort to write a biography of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven and edited her poems for publication. Unsuccessful in finding a publisher for the Baroness&#x27;s poetry, Barnes abandoned the project. After writing a number of chapter drafts of the biography, she abandoned that project, too, after submitting the first chapter to Emily Coleman in 1939, whose response was not encouraging. Barnes&#x27;s efforts at writing the biography are detailed in Irene Gammel&#x27;s &quot;Baroness Elsa&quot; biography.

==Legacy==
Barnes has been cited as an influence by writers as diverse as Truman Capote, William Goyen, Karen Blixen, John Hawkes, Bertha Harris, Dylan Thomas, David Foster Wallace, and Anaïs Nin. Writer Bertha Harris described her work as &quot;practically the only available expression of lesbian culture we have in the modern western world&quot; since Sappho.

Barnes&#x27;s biographical notes and collection of manuscripts have been a major source for scholars who have brought the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven forth from the margins of Dada history. They were key in producing &quot;Body Sweats: The Uncensored Writings of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven&quot; (2011), the first major English collection of the baroness&#x27;s poems, and a biography titled &quot;Baroness Elsa: Gender, Dada and Everyday Modernity&quot; (2002).

==Fictional portrayals==
Cynthia Grant and Svetlana Zylin co-wrote the play &quot;Djuna: What of the Night&quot; based on Barnes&#x27;s life and works. The play premiered in 1991.

Emmanuelle Uzan played Barnes in a brief cameo role with no dialogue in Woody Allen&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;.

<doc id="377705" wikidata="Q741279" url="?curid=377705" title="Madelyne Pryor">
<text>Madelyne Jennifer Pryor is a supervillain and occasional antihero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist Paul Smith, the character first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #168 (April 1983). Primarily featured off-and-on as an antagonist of the X-Men, Madelyne Pryor is a clone of Jean Grey, the ex-love-interest and first wife of Cyclops, and the mother of Cable. She was a long-standing member of the &quot;X-Men&quot; supporting cast until a series of traumas eventually led to her being manipulated into becoming the Goblin Queen.

Jennifer Hale voices Madelyne Pryor in &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot;, a sequel series to &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;.

==Publication history==
Madelyne Pryor was introduced during the acclaimed 1983 &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; run that saw long-time writer Chris Claremont pair with artist Paul Smith for a series of issues that would see the look-alike of Jean Grey marry the retired X-Men leader Cyclops (Scott Summers). She first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #168 (April 1983). Multiple retcons in her publication history and that of Jean have particularly complicated her biography.

Madelyne&#x27;s hairstyle design was modeled on that of Louise Simonson, the book&#x27;s editor (at the time) then known as Louise Jones—a design retained on the character until 1988. Claremont named the character after Steeleye Span singer Maddy Prior. Claremont had already created a character named &quot;Maddy Pryor&quot;, a little girl who appeared briefly in &quot;Avengers&quot; Annual #10 (1981), and has no in-story connections to the X-Men character. Claremont, nonetheless, years later took an opportunity to indulge in an in-joke: in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #238 (1988), a similar child would appear as Madelyne&#x27;s mental image of herself, wearing the same clothes as the little girl from &quot;The Avengers&quot; Annual #10, repeating the girl&#x27;s same line of dialogue, but also singing &quot;Gone to America&quot;, one of Steeleye Span&#x27;s biggest hits.

According to Claremont, the original link between Madelyne and Jean was entirely the product of Mastermind. Seeking revenge against the X-Men after Mastermind was driven insane, Mastermind&#x27;s powers of illusion to convince the X-Men that Madelyne is the Phoenix—a cosmic threat—in an attempt to have the team kill her. Mastermind&#x27;s plan fails, and Madelyne and Cyclops are married shortly after. Claremont had conceived Madelyne as a device to write Cyclops out of the X-Men and have retire &quot;happily ever after&quot; with Madelyne and their child.

The story became more complicated in 1986 when moves by the editors and other writers to reunite the original X-Men, for the new title &quot;X-Factor&quot;, resulted in Jean&#x27;s resurrection and Scott leaving his wife and son. This deeply compromised Cyclops&#x27;s character and left little room for Madelyne, and Cyclops&#x27;s actions then—and towards even Jean much later—have been controversial ever since. Marvel avoided addressing these problems, instead resorting to a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;, in the 1989 &quot;Inferno&quot; crossover (co-scripted by Simonson with Claremont), in which Madelyne is retconned to be a clone of Jean created by Mister Sinister to produce a child with Cyclops, and corrupted by her anger and demonic influence as the Goblin Queen, leading to her elimination and into an object of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; (and &quot;nonperson&quot; status) for several years.

Asked about his intended plans for Madelyne&#x27;s character, Claremont said:
The character was brought back in 1995 as a supporting character in &quot;X-Man&quot;, a marginal X-Men related title. Though by 2001 and along with the cancellation of the &quot;X-Man&quot; title, this became a false start at reviving the character, as Pryor would again cease being featured in any Marvel titles, except when Chris Claremont included the character in his non-canon limited-series, &quot;X-Men: The End&quot; (2004-2006).

In 2008, the 25th anniversary of the character&#x27;s debut in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, the character was brought back in the flagship X-Men title for the first time since the 1989 &quot;Inferno&quot; storyline. But the following year and the 20th anniversary since &quot;Inferno&quot;, she was removed completely again, and would not be featured in another story until 2014–25 years since &quot;Inferno&quot;—in a single issue of the secondary title, &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 4), and was also included in a flashback story by Claremont included in a 2014 X-Men 50th-anniversary one-shot titled &quot;X-Men: Gold&quot; (unrelated to a 2017 monthly also titled &quot;X-Men Gold&quot;).

Pryor was again absent for an extended time until featured in another flashback story also by Claremont, included in the one-shot &quot;X-Men: The Exterminated&quot; in 2018–35 years since her debut. She was subsequently brought back as a recurring character, first in &quot;Hellions&quot; from 2020 to 2022, and then &quot;New Mutants&quot; in 2022. Immediately following this, Pryor was featured as a main character in the crossover storyline &quot;Dark Web&quot;, a combined sequel to both &quot;Inferno&quot; and a recent Spider-Man storyline, &quot;Beyond&quot;. Released from 2022 to the following year, its 2023 conclusion—the 40th anniversary of the debut of Madelyne Pryor—featured the character granted the most significant change and elevation to her status quo by Marvel since 1989.

==Fictional character biography==
===Whirlwind romance===
Madelyne Pryor was a cargo pilot in Anchorage, Alaska working for Scott Summers&#x27;s grandparents when she and Scott meet during a Summers family reunion. A romantic relationship quickly begins between them, however, Scott is disturbed at her striking resemblance to Jean Grey. Also, she was the sole survivor of an airplane crash that occurred the same day Jean died on the moon. In addition, Professor X is unable to telepathically scan her mind, noting it is a rare immunity that does exist even in normal human brains. Scott, still recovering from Jean&#x27;s death, becomes obsessed with the idea that Madelyne is Jean&#x27;s reincarnation, eventually confronting her with these suspicions. Madelyne, furious and hurt, punches Scott and runs from the latter. As soon as she is alone, she is abducted by Mastermind who had been manipulating the X-Men for months as revenge by having Madelyne appear as the Phoenix. Storm summons a violent storm which defeats Mastermind and nearly kills Madelyne, but Scott resuscitates her. After the conflict, Scott comes to terms with the fact that Jean is dead and that Madelyne is someone else, and that Scott loves her all the same. The two are married, and Scott retires from active duty with the X-Men.

===Anodyne===
Scott giving up the life of an adventurer for Madelyne proves harder than imagined. Early in Madelyne and Scott&#x27;s marriage, they (along with Alpha Flight and the rest of the X-Men) are taken to an abandoned city by the Asgardian trickster-god Loki. Entirely for his own purposes, Loki bestows mystical powers on a small group of non-powered humans, including Madelyne, transforming her into a healer of virtually any injury, illness, psychological issue, or physical defect. She adopts the name Anodyne and cures Scott&#x27;s childhood head injury, enabling Scott to control the optic blasts without the use of ruby-quartz lenses. She also removes Aurora&#x27;s DID and Wolverine&#x27;s berserker rage. When it is discovered that Loki&#x27;s gifts are extremely flawed and fatal to some, everyone assembled rejects the gift. Madelyne and the other beneficiaries are reverted to the original states, as are all those who had been healed by Madelyne. During this adventure, Madelyne reveals that she is pregnant.

===Abandonment===
Going into premature labor, Madelyne gives birth to Nathan Summers alone in the X-Mansion. Sensing a reluctance on Scott&#x27;s part to retire to family life, the powerless Storm challenges Scott to a duel for leadership of the team, which Storm wins. This in effect forces Scott to accept his role as a husband and father.

Although Scott tries to live a normal family life in Alaska, he often thinks of Jean and of life with the X-Men. Maddie tries her best to make Scott happy, but her efforts seem wasted. Finally Scott receives a call from former teammate Angel that Jean has been found alive. Without explanation, Scott abandons Madelyne and Nathan to reunite with Jean, and forms X-Factor with old friends from the original X-Men. Madelyne and Nathan are then attacked by the Marauders; Nathan is kidnapped and Madelyne left for dead, but survives and is hospitalized as a &quot;Jane Doe&quot;. The guilt-wracked and increasingly unstable Scott returned home to find the house empty, and all records of Madelyne&#x27;s and Nathan&#x27;s existence erased.

Alone and threatened, Madelyne calls the X-Men for help and fight off another attack by the Marauders. Despairing from Scott&#x27;s absence and of Nathan&#x27;s fate, she contemplates suicide. Havok (Alex Summers) talks her out of it, and the two of them grow closer. With the Marauders still after her, she stays with the X-Men, and the group sacrifice their lives to stop the Adversary from remaking the world in &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot;. A reporter video-interviews them before their death, and Maddie uses this to deliver a message to Scott, pleading that Scott find their child. With the world thinking the X-Men dead, Madelyne and the X-Men are resurrected by the Omniversal Guardian Roma and begin working secretly out of the Reavers&#x27; abandoned base in Australia. Madelyne serves as the team&#x27;s technical support.

===Demonic corruption and origins revealed===
Monitoring news transmissions, Madelyne learns that Jean is alive and with Scott. She punches the computer monitor&#x27;s screen, breaking it and causing electrical feedback that renders her unconscious. The Limbo demon S&#x27;ym invades Madelyne&#x27;s mind during her unconscious state, and puts her in a Nightmare Sequence wherein her husband shows up and tells Madelyne of not loving her anymore, takes Nathan away from her, and then systematically takes away all her physical features — clothes, hair, mouth, nose and eyes — and puts them on a featureless mannequin revealed to be Jean. When it&#x27;s done, Jean is real again and Madelyne is the featureless mannequin, unable to even scream. They walk away happily with the baby, leaving the naked and faceless Maddie to struggle alone through a blistering wasteland, burning her away until she runs into S&#x27;ym offering her a deal to become more than she had been and shows her images of a girl, a pilot, a woman, and a demon, which reflects what she was, is, and what she dreams to become. Thinking this all is just a dream, Madelyne chooses the demon, whereupon S&#x27;ym stabs her with a finger. She falls unconscious, dressed in a cropped black leather shirt, leather loincloth, and thigh-high Combat Stiletto boots, thus reflecting her eventual change into the Goblin Queen.

Afterwards, she keeps the existence of the original X-Men as X-Factor secret from the others, filtering only information and news showing X-Factor as an anti-mutant group. Later abducted by the Genoshans and taken to the island-nation, Madelyne is subjected to psychic torture intended to transform her into a docile slave of the state. Madelyne instinctively lashes out with her developing abilities, and thus causes the deaths of her torturers. In the recorded images of the psychic probe performed on Madelyne, a connection is made to the Phoenix Force, and her attire reflects again her eventual change into the Goblin Queen. Shortly after being rescued by the X-Men, Madelyne strikes a bargain with N&#x27;astirh to find the Marauders and return Nathan to her. During this time, she and Alex become lovers.
To keep the end of their bargain, N&#x27;astirh takes Madelyne to the orphanage in Nebraska where Scott had grown up, actually a front for Mister Sinister&#x27;s genetic laboratory. Mister Sinister appears and tells Madelyne about her origins. When Mister Sinister learned about Jean, the former planned to take the girl to the orphanage but Charles Xavier had already approached and started to work with the young girl. Mister Sinister only managed to acquire a blood and tissue sample from which a clone was created. However, the clone had no life and failed to develop any mutant powers, so Mister Sinister left the clone in her incubation tube as a failed experiment. However, a part of the Phoenix Force entered and awakened the clone, giving her sentience. This renewed Mister Sinister&#x27;s interest in her, named her as a pun on her prior existence, created a false background, implanted memories, a personality designed to attract Scott, and conceived a plan to use the clone to facilitate selective breeding between her and Scott. He then planted her with Scott&#x27;s grandparents&#x27; company, thus ensuring the two would eventually meet. Jean&#x27;s return threatened to cause the truth about Madelyne to be uncovered if the two were to meet, so Mister Sinister tasked the Marauders with killing Madelyne and bringing Nathan, the fruit of Mister Sinister&#x27;s scheme.

Broken in spirit and reduced to insanity by these revelations, when N&#x27;astirh gives Nathan back to her, Madelyne willingly decides to aid the demon in the &quot;Inferno&quot; invasion of Earth. Returning to New York City during the invasion, she confronts X-Factor. When the X-Men arrive, Madelyne manipulates the teams against each other at first, and convinces Alex to join her. X-Factor and the other X-Men work together to defeat N&#x27;astirh. Madelyne refuses to stop, forcing the heroes to overwhelm her. Cyclops is unable to act because most of her accusations are true. Cyclops rescues Nathan, but Madelyne commits suicide in an attempt to telepathically take Jean with her. The Phoenix Force appears to Jean and offers to save the latter, but in order to survive Jean has to integrate the essence of both the Phoenix and Madelyne, gaining their memories and personalities. Mister Sinister attempts to entrap all of the X-Men and X-Factor in Madelyne&#x27;s dying mind, but forced to choose between having revenge either on the X-Men or Mister Sinister, Madelyne ejects Mister Sinister from her mind. With her personality influencing Jean&#x27;s, she then prompts the X-Men and X-Factor to attempt lethal retribution against Mister Sinister.

Jean, having inherited Madelyne&#x27;s maternal feelings for Nathan, becomes a proxy mother until Apocalypse infected Nathan with a techno-organic virus, resulting in the child taken 2,000 years into the future by Askani to be saved.

===Reappearance===
Madelyne mysteriously reappears years later as an amnesiac to Nate Grey (X-Man), the &quot;genetic offspring&quot; of Cyclops and Jean from the alternate reality known as the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; and arrives into Earth-616. Under the tutelage of Selene, Madelyne eventually becomes the Black Rook of the Hellfire Club as well as Sebastian Shaw&#x27;s mistress, has her memories of her previous life restored by Tessa, and meets Cable in an uneasy truce.

While searching for Nate, she encounters Threnody who reveals to her that even though she is walking around and breathing, she is actually still dead. Angered, she murders Threnody. She then finds Nate with Jean and a fight ensues. Nate chooses to side with Jean over her. Then it is revealed that Madelyne is actually a &quot;psionic construct&quot; inadvertently resurrected by a combination of Nate&#x27;s psionic powers and desperate need for a mother figure upon arriving on Earth-616.

Antagonistic for a time after this revelation, Madelyne walks away from the Hellfire Club, turning her back on a carefully built alliance/partnership with Shaw, and goes looking for Nate. Later they are attacked by the Strikesquad: Gauntlet, a group of operatives wearing psi-shielded armor. Madelyne is buried alive by one of them but she manages to escape by teleporting. As the battle has weakened X-Man, she looks drained and withered. In no shape to continue, whatever the plans she&#x27;d had with Nate, she leaves.

===Red Queen===
Soon after, Nate is accompanied again by Madelyne alive and well, but she&#x27;s actually the Red Queen, a version of Jean Grey from the alternate reality Earth-9575 where she&#x27;s a power-hungry being of violence. She seems to have taken advantage of Madelyne&#x27;s fragile state and replaced her in order to worm her way into Nate&#x27;s head. She also claims to be the one who had influenced Nate into latching into Madelyne&#x27;s psychic energy remnants and give it form, but she is eventually killed when Nate creates a sun around her that burns her to death. The exact details of how she had replaced Madelyne are left unrevealed, but since it is shown that the Red Queen could absorb the life forces of others to enhance her own power, she may have easily absorbed Madelyne&#x27;s psionic body, or at least severed her consciousness’ connection to it. Cyclops and Cable would eventually encounter Madelyne within the telepathic astral plane, where she describes herself as now only a &quot;ghost&quot; and unable to return to the physical world.

Some years later, the X-Men investigate an anti-mutant group called the &quot;Hellfire Cult&quot;, being led by Empath who is secretly being controlled and taking orders from a mysterious woman under the name of Red Queen who is particularly interested in learning about Emma Frost. The X-Men take down the Cult and capture Empath, but the Red Queen slips away unseen. She then psionically impersonates Frost and has virtual sex with Scott, without him realizing the deception. Afterward, the Red Queen travels to Madripoor where she recruits Chimera into a new group called the &quot;Sisterhood of Mutants&quot; and reveals herself to be Madelyne returned to the living somehow. Later during a concert of Dazzler&#x27;s, Scott is surprised at the sight of Madelyne observing the former from a distance before losing her amongst the crowd.

With Martinique Jason (recruited before the Cult&#x27;s exposure) and Chimera accompanying her, Madelyne recruits Spiral and Lady Deathstrike into the Sisterhood as well. Madelyne then recruits Martinique&#x27;s half-sister, Lady Mastermind, who accepts membership upon Madelyne&#x27;s peculiar (and ironic) promise to bring back the half-sisters&#x27; late father, the original Mastermind. Carrying out Madelyne&#x27;s orders, the Sisterhood retrieves the corpse of Revanche and performs an elaborate set of procedures on Revanche and the captured Psylocke, fully restoring the body and transferring Psylocke&#x27;s mind into it. Madelyne&#x27;s true priority was to restore herself back into flesh and blood. In the time since the encounter in the astral plane, Pryor had eventually managed to manifest back in the physical world as an intangible entity of psionic energy, and needed to find a body to inhabit that could contain her disembodied form and psionic powers. The experiment on Psylocke served as a test run for Pryor.

The Sisterhood commences a surprise raid on the X-Men&#x27;s base, quickly neutralizing several of the main X-members. Recovering from the initial attacks, the X-Men force the Sisterhood (now including the brainwashed Psylocke) to retreat. But the battle was only a distraction, as the real purpose was for Madelyne to locate Jean&#x27;s gravesite. Madelyne&#x27;s own body had been cremated after her suicide, so Jean&#x27;s seemed the only option available to her. At Jean&#x27;s grave, Madelyne attempts to repeat the ritual with her corpse. However, Cyclops had correctly guessed Madelyne&#x27;s goal and had arranged for Jean&#x27;s body to be replaced with another, which Madelyne only learned after it is too late. The second she binds herself to the corpse, she discorporates, as the decayed body cannot contain her vast psionic energies.

===&quot;Avengers Vs. X-Men&quot;===
During the 2012 &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Mister Sinister creates a group of six clones of Madelyne Pryor in order to take the Phoenix Force energies from the Phoenix Five (consisting of the Phoenix Force-empowered Cyclops, Colossus, Frost, Magik, and Namor). Unlike the original Madelyne, none of the six clones show indications of having individual personalities or free will, but instead appear to follow Mister Sinister completely. The clones join Mister Sinister&#x27;s other clone creations in fighting the Phoenix Five, and manage to defeat each one. They are also able to siphon some of the energy from the Phoenix Force, but are all immediately killed by the entity itself.

===Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s Sisterhood===
Lady Deathstrike, whose consciousness had taken possession of Colombian girl Ana Cortes, formed an all-new Sisterhood initially comprising the latter, the mutant Typhoid Mary, and the exiled Asgardian Amora (the Enchantress). The sentient bacteria Arkea possesses Lady Deathstrike&#x27;s assistant Reiko and joins. As Arkea fears being opposed by the X-Men, she wants powerhouses with the Sisterhood, so she has Enchantress use her magicks to restore Selene and makes plans to resurrect Madelyne. Cortes manages to turn against Deathstrike, contact the X-Men and alert the group of the Sisterhood&#x27;s location, and then commit suicide in an attempt to foil Arkea&#x27;s plans. Arkea is able to place Deathstrike&#x27;s consciousness into Reiko, and seeing an opportunity, splices Jean&#x27;s DNA to Ana&#x27;s body, making it a fully compatible host for Madelyne. The Enchantress then uses her magicks to retrieve Madelyne&#x27;s consciousness and place it into the body, reviving Madelyne (and seemingly reshaping Cortes&#x27;s physical appearance into Madelyne&#x27;s), and making her flesh-and-blood again for the first time since her own suicide. When the X-Men arrive and attack, Madelyne fights and telepathically defeats the more experienced telepath Rachel Grey. Storm offers Madelyne and Selene a deal, essentially letting them go free, as the X-Men are only after Arkea at the moment. As Madelyne and the other members of the Sisterhood don&#x27;t particularly care for Arkea, they desert her, allowing all of the Arkea bacteria to be destroyed. Accompanied by Selene, Madelyne declares that she would create an all new Sisterhood.

===Krakoa===
Madelyne is not seen in &quot;the first wave&quot; of mutant villains who accept Xavier&#x27;s invitation to join on Krakoa. However, she is referenced in Mister Sinister&#x27;s Red Diamond, a gossip sheet that cryptically lists Mister Sinister&#x27;s secrets, indicating that her legacy as the Goblin Queen is far from complete.

====&quot;Hellions&quot;====
When Mister Sinister sent the second Hellions team of mutants to destroy the abandoned cloning farm hidden under the old Nebraska orphanage, they are surprised to find Madelyne there. In her Goblin Queen attire, Madelyne had captured and tortured Mister Sinister&#x27;s former team of killers, the Marauders, and turned them into zombie-like creatures. Madelyne commands the zombified Marauders to attack the Hellions, but captures and takes Havok prisoner, deciding to reunite with her former lover, and silences him by removing his mouth. She reveals her anger that no one cared about her return and then her seeming exclusion from Krakoa, and so plans to unleash an army of cloned Marauder zombies to attack the mutant island just to be noticed and prove her existence. Havok cuts open his mouth to speak, and impresses her by admitting that he had genuine feelings for Madelyne all along back when she and Scott were together. The Hellions thwart her plans by killing all the zombies, and Madelyne is fatally shot by John Greycrow as well. As she dies, Madelyne heals Alex&#x27;s injured face and tells him that she only wanted to be acknowledged and remembered. When the team returns to Krakoa, Cyclops himself tells Havok that while the Quiet Council has decided to approve resurrection for the original Marauders, they decided not to resurrect Madelyne on the grounds that she was a clone. The decision infuriates and devastates Havok, who screams at his brother that she was a real person who did in fact exist. What Havok doesn&#x27;t known is that the Council had not been able to decide whether Madelyne was a clone or her own person, so her resurrection remains undecided.

Madelyne&#x27;s fate still weighs heavily on Havok&#x27;s mind, as seen during the first Annual Hellfire Gala, when he tries to speak with Xavier and Magneto about the decision. Madelyne is eventually resurrected and reunited with Havok. She is seen wearing a version of the flight suit that she had originally worn with the X-Men, positioning her as “good Madelyne” again; but when she sees herself in a mirror, it reflects her Goblin Queen persona. On top of that is the suggestion that she hadn’t wanted to be resurrected at all, recognising that she’s being cast as the prize in somebody else’s story, and understandably resentful of it.

====&quot;The Labors of Magik&quot;====
Immediately afterwards, Madelyne—back in her Goblin Queen attire—is approached by Illyana Rasputin with a proposal. Wanting to transcend her traumatic past by distancing herself from Limbo, but needing to find a new ruler for the demonic dimension, Magik—over the objections of her fellow New Mutants—offers handing over rulership of the realm to Pryor. Illyana regards Madelyne as suitable to take over due to Pryor&#x27;s past connection to Limbo and because, like Magik, she too has survived painfully traumatic experiences and is still a damaged soul, as Illyana declares anyone normal and &quot;untouched by darkness&quot; to be ill-suited to rule Limbo. Seeing Limbo as a second chance for herself and the means to cut any ties with Krakoa and all the people (i.e. Mister Sinister, Cyclops, Jean, even Havok) who she resents for always defining her entire existence, Madelyne accepts Illyana&#x27;s offer. Though only after the pair and their group found themselves forced to journey and fight together against foes trying to destroy Magik and seize her power, does the handover happen. With Rasputin&#x27;s rulership of Limbo relinquished, Madelyne—attired in a new outfit—is now Queen of Limbo.

====&quot;Dark Web&quot;====
Some time after, Ben Reilly, the wayward and now-vengeful clone of Peter Parker and using the alias &quot;Chasm&quot;, feels himself being drawn to and enters Limbo and encounters Madelyne. Feeling they have much in common as victimized and outcast clones who both believed their mutual progenitors had destroyed their lives, Madelyne and Ben form an alliance and plan to strike back. As a demonstration of their teamwork, Madelyne has a demon possess a mailbox and attack Spider-Man while she and Ben watch from afar. Madelyne later finds Eddie Brock (Venom) wandering in Limbo as he seeks a way back to Earth and convinces him that participating with her and Chasm will be mutually beneficial. Reilly&#x27;s girlfriend Janine Godbe requests that she be provided the means to participate alongside Ben. As Janine has also been a mistreated and victimized woman for most of her life, Madelyne sympathizes with Janine and so transforms her into a new supervillain called &quot;Hallows&#x27; Eve&quot;.

Brock grows impatient and uncooperative with Pryor and Chasm, leading to them regressing Brock&#x27;s mind back into the primitive and savage Venom of the past. Madelyne unleashes her demons into Manhattan, which Spider-Man and the X-Men battle against, while Chasm begins striking at some of Peter&#x27;s friends. Though the rampaging demons are just a distraction to scatter and occupy the X-Men away from their Manhattan base, at which Venom is sent to attack as an added decoy to enable Hallows&#x27; Eve to raid the base and steal a device for Madelyne. When Magik, Jean, Havok, and Cyclops enter Limbo to confront Madelyne, they&#x27;re taken prisoner. Jean eventually breaks free and battles Madelyne, until Jean discovers that Maddie&#x27;s plotting was all just to possess Jean&#x27;s memories and experiences from the very brief time she was proxy mother to Nathan, the son that Maddie lost to Jean. Jean voluntarily shares all the memories with Madelyne, also revealing that she had advocated from the start that Maddie be granted a Krakoan resurrection, finally seeming to mend her last unhealed emotional wounds and making peace between them.

Madelyne tries to end what she started and approaches Chasm and Hallows&#x27; Eve with this. Having not succeeded in gaining what he wanted from his vendetta on Parker, both Chasm and Eve take Maddie&#x27;s abandoning of their plotting as a betrayal and usurp Madelyne&#x27;s power as ruler of Limbo. Chasm teleports a massive tower into Manhattan and launches a massive demonic invasion. Madelyne then joins with the heroes to stop him.

During the climactic battle, Madelyne reasserts her rulership over the demons as the &quot;Goblin Queen of Limbo&quot; and Chasm is defeated, though Hallows&#x27; Eve escapes. In the aftermath, Madelyne takes custody of Reilly as her prisoner, the Limbo tower remains in place in New York as an &quot;Embassy of Limbo&quot;, and Madelyne seems to continue to be an ally of the X-Men and Spider-Man. She and Alex also rekindle their romantic relationship.

====Leading the Dark X-Men====
During the &quot;Fall of X&quot; event, the Hellfire Gala was attacked by Orchis. In retaliation, Madelyne establishes her version of the Dark X-Men with Havok, Carmen Cruz, Gambit, Maggott, Azazel, Emplate, and Zero (who is possessing Albert).

===Post-Krakoa===
Soon after the end of the mutant nation, Madelyne and Alex part ways again.

==Powers and abilities==
As a clone of Jean Grey, Madelyne Pryor possesses mutant abilities of telepathy and telekinesis. These powers were completely dormant while she was believed to be a baseline human, but later manifested in ways that Jean&#x27;s abilities never had.

During her brief time as Anodyne when she was still believed to be a human, Madelyne was endowed with Asgardian magic that manifested as eldritch flames which granted her the power to heal and cure. Among her beneficial actions were fixing the childhood brain injury that prevented proper control behind Cyclops&#x27;s optic blasts, curing Puck&#x27;s mystically induced dwarfism, unifying Aurora&#x27;s multiple personalities, and giving the ability of control for Rogue&#x27;s mutant power. Madelyne also seemed to gain the physical stature of an Asgardian.

As the Goblin Queen, Madelyne&#x27;s long-dormant mutant powers were activated with demonic eldritch magic and exponentially enhanced to the point where she could warp reality, equivalent to Proteus&#x27;s abilities, within a localized area, possibly over an entire city as demonstrated during &quot;Inferno&quot;.

After her apparent resurrection as a non-physical entity of psionic energy (similar to the Shadow King) by Nate Grey, Madelyne regained her natural mutant abilities albeit without the demonic enhancements, though her powers are still considerable. Her telepathy enables her to read minds, broadcast her thoughts, create illusions, change or erase memories, and defend herself against other telepaths. With her telekinesis, Madelyne can lift and manipulate large objects, levitate, fire powerful mental force-blasts, form protective shields, and rearrange small objects on a molecular level. Madelyne also utilizes her powers to augment her physical strength and agility, making her formidable in hand-to-hand combat. Madelyne also learned how to use her powers to teleport over long distances by psychokinetically shifting in and out of the astral plane, and was shown to be able to carry along at least one other person with her when teleporting, and was also able to channel psionic energies from other psionic-powered mutants to boost her own abilities or those of another (usually Nate and Cable). It&#x27;s speculated that Selene&#x27;s tutelage made these added abilities possible. Since being restored back into a flesh-and-blood physical human-being, Madelyne seems not to have the teleporting and psionic-energy channeling abilities anymore, and so then uses Limbo&#x27;s magic to teleport.

As the Red Queen, Madelyne additionally demonstrated other abilities of a mysterious nature which she referred to as &quot;magic&quot;, which were probably related to the eldritch magics she had previously wielded. She was shown to heal wounds, locate spirits interdimensionally, and work in conjunction with science to restore life to the dead.

To prepare Madelyne to rule Limbo as its next queen Illyana Rasputin had been teaching her other magics. The first example shown is how to channel emotions to create certain types of weapons similar to the Soulsword and the Souldagger. By channeling her emotional pain and regret, Madelyne created a mystical scythe weapon called both the &quot;Scythe of Sorrows&quot; and the &quot;Soul-Scythe&quot;, and uses it as a symbol to command Limbo’s demons and as a medium to focus Limbo&#x27;s magic. Illyana also handed Limbo&#x27;s huge library of eldritch texts over to Pryor, which she consults as needed.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
David Harth of Comic Book Resources (CBR) called Madelyne Pryor one of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;coolest X-Men villains&quot;, writing, &quot;Pryor can&#x27;t catch a break, which is part of what makes her interesting. She&#x27;s easy to empathize with for readers, as she is definitely a character readers can feel sorry for and even root for to an extent. Her motivations make her a believable villain, and as a clone of Jean Grey, she wields a jaw-dropping amount of power.&quot;

==Other versions==

===&quot;What If&quot;...?===
In one alternate reality (Earth-89112), Madelyne Pryor and S&#x27;ym were successful in opening a portal between Limbo and Earth (having killed baby Nathan Christopher) and demons overran the planet. The X-Men and X-Factor were dead (with the exception of a possessed Wolverine), and the only resistance left was led by Doctor Strange, who attempted to summon the Phoenix Force through Rachel Summers, the reality-hopping daughter of Scott Summers and Jean Grey. Madelyne however was successful in quelling the resistance and wresting control of the Phoenix Force from Rachel, but was ultimately betrayed and killed by S&#x27;ym, using Wolverine&#x27;s reanimated adamantium skeleton. Rachel, reassuming the mantle of the Phoenix, used the Force to cleanse the planet of the demon plague.

On Earth-9250, most mutants in the city of Manhattan are vampires ruled by Wolverine. Madelyne was not infected, but became the Goblyn Queen and planned on releasing a demon army to wipe out the vampire mutants and dominate the world. Madelyne made contact with the lord of the Dark Dimension, Dormammu, who became her ally. However, the vampiric Marvel Girl (Jean Grey) bonded with the Phoenix Force, became Dark Phoenix, and killed Madelyne and Dormammu.

Another reality saw Madelyne Pryor as a member of an &quot;X-Men&quot; team formed by Mr. Sinister alongside Cyclops (Scott Summers), Havok (Alex Summers), and Sabretooth. However this version of Madelyne had never been awakened by the Phoenix Force, so she was simply a mindless shell inhabited by the psychic entity Malice. Scott noticed his physical attraction to Madelyne, but could not respond to her advances; when he encountered Professor Xavier&#x27;s X-Men and their leader Jean Grey, however, much deeper emotions were stirred. Sinister called for their deaths, and under his orders Cyclops and Havok infiltrated Xavier&#x27;s X-Men as double agents.

===&quot;Mutant X&quot;===

In the alternate reality known as the Mutant X universe, young Scott Summers was abducted into space along with his father Christopher and mother Kate, leaving his brother Alex to become one of the founders of the X-Men as Havok. This reality&#x27;s Madelyne Pryor marries Alex and has a son, named Scotty, with him. Just like in Earth-616, Madelyne also makes a deal with Limbo&#x27;s demons, unlocking her latent psionic abilities, and initiates the &quot;Inferno Crisis&quot;. In this instance however, Madelyne survives the crisis; and, using the alias &quot;Marvel Woman&quot;, leaves the X-Men team with her husband when he forms the splinter group called &quot;The Six&quot;. Her evil side resurfaces a number of times, first as the &quot;Goblyn Queen&quot; and later as the &quot;Goblyn Force&quot;. When it returns a second time, it merges with the Beyonder to form a nigh-omnipotent being. Havok supposedly saves Madelyne by placing the &quot;Nexus of Realities&quot; in her body, purging her of the malevolent Goblyn Force and reuniting her with her son Scotty, before Havok returns once more to the void.

===&quot;Codename: X-Men&quot;===
A team of mutants forced against their will to serve in the government&#x27;s Weapon-X program to hunt and neutralize all other mutants, this group includes a female telepath codenamed &quot;Goblin Queen&quot;. Although she appears that she could be either Madelyne Pryor or Jean Grey, her real name is not revealed anywhere in the story, and no discernible reason is given for her codename.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the Marvel Mangaverse title &quot;Legacy of Fire&quot;, Madelyne Pryor was reinvented as Madelyne Pyre, a powerful sorceress and possessor of the Phoenix Sword, who was training her sister Jena to be her successor.

===&quot;X-Men: The End&quot;===
Madelyne Pryor plays an important role in &quot;X-Men: The End&quot;, Chris Claremont&#x27;s limited series about an alternate future. In the story, Madelyne — through circumstances left unexplained — makes a surprise return. Mysteriously joined with the X-Men&#x27;s alien enemies (the Skrulls and the Shi&#x27;ar), Madelyne affected a disguise to infiltrate the X-Men, planting herself near Cyclops for the rest of the series. Still seeking revenge against her former husband, Madelyne wavered however and protected him instead, after eavesdropping on Scott expressing remorse for everything that happened to her, and even implied that he genuinely loved her after all. Cyclops later admitted to having recognized her at some point, and an understanding and peace was finally reached between them, for the sake of aiding their son Cable in battle. When Cable&#x27;s effort leaves him dying, a grief-stricken Madelyne is accepted back with the X-Men again. After Cyclops and Jean Grey are also killed, Madelyne cryptically reveals that, since the very beginning, she was always both Madelyne Pryor and a crucial portion of Jean Grey herself (and even hinted to being the Dark Phoenix), explaining that she was the part of Jean that truly and completely loved Scott, and that was why Jean and Scott&#x27;s marriage failed. Madelyne then sacrifices herself by turning into energy and fusing with Jean Grey, who is once again resurrected. Jean is able to use her power to its fullest again, which allows her and all the dead X-Men to merge with the Phoenix and transcend to a new level of existence. In the story&#x27;s final panel, Madelyne&#x27;s image is present next to Cyclops&#x27; among the X-Men who died heroically.

===&quot;X-Men Forever&quot;===
In Claremont&#x27;s series set in an alternate universe from canon, &quot;X-Men Forever&quot;, Pryor does not appear though is mentioned a number of times, as the setting is some years after her death. While nearly every significant X-Men storyline and event from the comics before 1991 is referenced during the series, no mentions are made about &quot;Inferno&quot; or the Goblin Queen, implying that these did not happen here. And while Sinister and his clonings are present, there is also no mention of Madelyne ever being a clone of Jean Grey, implying that this was also not the case here. Except for it happening after her son was born, exactly when and how Pryor died went unrevealed in the series.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot; (2015)===

====&quot;Warzones: Inferno&quot;====
When Doctor Doom became the God-Emperor Doom and saved remnants of the destroyed Multiverse to form Battleworld, among the salvaged worlds was a reality where the X-Men failed to stop the &quot;Inferno&quot; event instigated by the Darkchilde and the Goblin Queen. Contrary to all assumptions, Madelyne Pryor never committed the sacrificial prolicide of her baby son, and had been raising Nathan in the years since.

Doom had made Pryor the ruling Baroness of the &quot;Domain of Limbo&quot; at first, until the X-Men entrapped the demonic invasion within Manhattan and war broke out between Madelyne and Illyana, leading to Cyclops being appointed Limbo&#x27;s Baron. Colossus would be forced into an alliance with Madelyne to deal with Illyana, only for Darkchilde to breach the containment and unleash Inferno on the rest of the domain. When Sinister emerged to coerce the defeated X-Men to ally with him against Darkchilde, Madelyne killed Sinister in overdue revenge. Colossus then had to kill Illyana after she massacred all the last remaining X-Men. In the aftermath, Pryor took possession of Darkchilde&#x27;s demonic magic, making Madelyne the next demonic sorceress and ruler of Limbo domain, with Nathan alongside her.

====Epilogue====
Doom himself acknowledged Pryor&#x27;s re-ascendance to Baroness. Pryor then became one of four Barons (among the others, an alternate version of Sinister) Doom chose as his &quot;Generals&quot; and ordered to field their armies to crush an uprising against the God Emperor. The Goblin Queen followed Doom&#x27;s wishes, until betrayed and then beaten-down by Sinister and Captain Marvel.

====&quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;====

Following the events of the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; and the restoration of Earth-616, this version of Madelyne Pryor was able to survive the destruction of Battleworld along with her pet dragon Bamfy and a horde of goblins. They opened a portal to a storage facility in Florida, from which they planned to invade Prime Earth, however, their mustering was interrupted by Wolverine and Angel, forcing the horde to withdraw. She later opened another portal to gain access to Earth in Miami and her hordes of demons descended to wreak chaos all over the place. She also revealed that when Battleworld began collapsing, twelve hell gates inexplicably opened near the area she was and she along with Bamfy entered one that took them to Limbo where they remained in the shadows. Now once again on Earth she had her horde of demons capture the small team of X-Men that were taking a break there and was on the verge of using them for her final sacrifice until her plans were interrupted by the arrival of the mystically infused time-displaced Hank McCoy which forced her to withdraw by using Bamfy to teleport her to some unknown place.

Madelyne has since been training the time-displaced Hank on how to hone his mystical capabilities. While training him, she travels across the multiverse collecting supernatural X-Men from alternate realities and promised to give them what they wanted if they help her. Madelyne then has Hank cast a ritual that summons her and her new team of supernatural X-Men, calling them her &quot;Hex Men&quot;, and ambushes Magneto&#x27;s team of X-Men in Madripoor. Her goal is to use the ritual that Beast started to summon alternate versions of herself trapped in the underworld and bring them to the surface to help her gain power. Bloodstorm sees how Madelyne has used them as a means to her own goal and knows that she will throw the Hex Men to the wolves when her main goal is accomplished. Bloodstorm convinces Beast to betray Madelyne and in doing so interrupts the ritual. Because of the interruption, the alternate versions of Madelyne drag her and all of the Hex Men to the underworld with them except for Bloodstorm and Beast.

====&quot;Fall of X: Dark X-Men&quot;====

While trapped in the depths of Limbo, the Goblin Queen lost all human aspects and became completely demonic. The anti-mutant organization Orchis later found her in a forgotten corner of that realm and held her captive alongside her Bamf Dragon. While first used as one of Orchis&#x27; test subjects on an experimental method of deactivating the mutant X-gene, she nevertheless began working for Orchis, using her knowledge of dark arts to corrupt Archangel. She then assisted Orchis&#x27; invasion into 616-Madelyne Pryor&#x27;s Limbo Embassy. While Pryor&#x27;s Dark X-Men eliminated the Orchis invaders, the demonic Goblin Queen worked to tempt 616-Madelyne to join alongside her in destroying the world due to their similar histories of betrayals and suffering. 616-Pryor refused and killed her demonic counterpart (and afterward also made the Bamf Dragon her pet).

===&quot;X-Men: The Exterminated&quot;===
A story by Claremont again, included as an addition with the main story in &quot;The Exterminated&quot; one-shot, appears as if to be a flashback from just after Cyclops and Storm&#x27;s leadership duel and his moving back to Alaska with Pryor. Circumstances shown here lead to Scott and Madelyne happily reconciling (before the discovery and return of Jean Grey). This and other differences from canon seem to place this story in the setting of Claremont&#x27;s &quot;X-Men Forever&quot; universe.

===&quot;X-Men: Grand Design&quot;===
In &quot;X-Men: Grand Design&quot;, a limited series by Ed Piskor that condenses four decades of X-Men-related canon from the 1960s debut onward, Madelyne&#x27;s introduction and early storylines are included but substantially rewritten in the second half of the title&#x27;s &quot;Second Genesis&quot; chapter. Madelyne debuts and participates in stories that originally featured Lee Forrester, who is entirely excluded in this retelling (but is name-dropped later in the series&#x27; final panel). When Madelyne and Scott Summers meet and begin their relationship, she is not a pilot in Alaska but is still described as surviving a plane crash in the past, and Mastermind&#x27;s actions on Madelyne never happen at all in this telling before she and Scott marry.

Madelyne&#x27;s history continues in the first half of the &quot;X-Tinction&quot; chapter that follows, starting with the birth of Nathan/Cable and the marriage&#x27;s disintegration, to concluding at her death during &quot;Inferno&quot;. While the encounter with Loki with her moment as Anodyne and her later abduction by Genosha are excluded, all the rest of her story with the X-Men is here. Madelyne is emphasized as the victim in everything, not culpable for &quot;Inferno&quot; nor intending to harm her son. And her death is presented as more accidental instead of suicide.

===&quot;Jean Grey&quot; (2023)===
As Jean Grey drifts between life and death after her assassination during Orchis&#x27; attack on the Hellfire Gala, she ponders what if she had made different decisions at critical chapters in her history -- including &quot;Inferno&quot; and towards Madelyne Pryor. The Phoenix Force shows Grey one alternate history in which if Grey took different actions during &quot;Inferno&quot;, Pryor&#x27;s rage and hatred would only have increased, leading her to gaining exponentially greater powers and then destroying the world. After rejecting this and other alternate scenarios shown to her, Jean accepts all her actions and history as it was -- and also now fully accepting Madelyne&#x27;s creation and existence as blessings instead of a curse, and that Maddie was legitimately Scott&#x27;s wife and Nathan Christopher&#x27;s biological mother.

===&quot;Weapon X-Men&quot;===
An alternate universe labeled Earth-80777 is almost three decades in the future and where Jean Grey has continued to be the cosmic-powered Phoenix and the X-Men disbanded. Scott Summers also married Madelyne Pryor here, but they are shown to have remained happily together and their son Nathaniel (instead of Nathan) was not infected or sent to the future and is in his twenties. It&#x27;s mentioned that Madelyne&#x27;s origins were similar to 616 universe, but Phoenix completely eliminated Mister Sinister here and Maddie seems not to have any powers at all.

<doc id="377720" wikidata="Q1252491" url="?curid=377720" title="Filter feeder">
<text>Filter feeders are aquatic animals that acquire nutrients by feeding on organic matters, food particles or smaller organisms (bacteria, microalgae and zooplanktons) suspended in water, typically by having the water pass over or through a specialized filtering organ that sieves out and/or traps solids. Filter feeders can play an important role in condensing biomass and removing excess nutrients (such as nitrogen and phosphate) from the local waterbody, and are therefore considered water-cleaning ecosystem engineers. They are also important in bioaccumulation and, as a result, as indicator organisms.

Filter feeders can be sessile, planktonic, nektonic or even neustonic (in the case of the buoy barnacle) depending on the species and the niches they have evolved to occupy. Extant species that rely on such method of feeding encompass numerous phyla, including poriferans (sponges), cnidarians (jellyfish, sea pens and corals), arthropods (krill, mysids and barnacles), molluscs (bivalves, such as clams, scallops and oysters), echinoderms (sea lilies) and chordates (lancelets, sea squirts and salps, as well as many marine vertebrates such as most species of forage fish, American paddlefish, silver and bighead carps, baleen whales, manta ray and three species of sharks—the whale shark, basking shark and megamouth shark). Some water birds such as flamingos and certain duck species, though predominantly terrestrial, are also filter feeders when foraging.

==Fish==
Most forage fish are filter feeders. For example, the Atlantic menhaden, a type of herring, lives on plankton caught in midwater. Adult menhaden can filter up to four gallons of water a minute and play an important role in clarifying ocean water. They are also a natural check to the deadly red tide.

In addition to these bony fish, four types of cartilaginous fishes are also filter feeders. The whale shark sucks in a mouthful of water, closes its mouth and expels the water through its gills. During the slight delay between closing the mouth and opening the gill flaps, plankton is trapped against the dermal denticles which line its gill plates and pharynx. This fine sieve-like apparatus, which is a unique modification of the gill rakers, prevents the passage of anything but fluid out through the gills (anything above 2 to 3 mm in diameter is trapped). Any material caught in the filter between the gill bars is swallowed. Whale sharks have been observed &quot;coughing&quot; and it is presumed that this is a method of clearing a build up of food particles in the gill rakers. The megamouth shark has luminous organs called photophores around its mouth. It is believed they may exist to lure plankton or small fish into its mouth. The basking shark is a passive filter feeder, filtering zooplankton, small fish, and invertebrates from up to 2,000 tons of water per hour. Unlike the megamouth and whale sharks, the basking shark does not appear to actively seek its quarry; but it does possess large olfactory bulbs that may guide it in the right direction. Unlike the other large filter feeders, it relies only on the water that is pushed through the gills by swimming; the megamouth shark and whale shark can suck or pump water through their gills. Manta rays can time their arrival at the spawning of large shoals of fish and feed on the free-floating eggs and sperm. This stratagem is also employed by whale sharks.

==Arthropods==
Like all arthropods, crustaceans are ecdysozoans, a clade without cilia. Cilia play an important role for many filter feeding animals, but because crustaceans don&#x27;t have them, they need to use modified extremities for filter feeding instead. Mysidaceans live close to shore and hover above the sea floor, constantly collecting particles with their filter basket. They are an important food source for herring, cod, flounder, and striped bass. Mysids have a high resistance to toxins in polluted areas, and may contribute to high toxin levels in their predators. Antarctic krill manages to directly utilize the minute phytoplankton cells, which no other higher animal of krill size can do. This is accomplished through filter feeding, using the krill&#x27;s developed front legs, providing for a very efficient filtering apparatus: the six thoracopods form a very effective &quot;feeding basket&quot; used to collect phytoplankton from the open water. In the animation at the top of this page, the krill is hovering at a 55° angle on the spot. In lower food concentrations, the feeding basket is pushed through the water for over half a meter in an opened position, and then the algae are combed to the mouth opening with special setae on the inner side of the thoracopods.
Porcelain crabs have feeding appendages covered with setae to filter food particles from the flowing water.
Most species of barnacles are filter feeders, using their highly modified legs to sift plankton from the water.

Also some insects with aquatic larvae or nymphs are filter feeders during their aquatic stage. Such as some species of mayfly nymphs, mosquito larvae, and black fly larvae. Instead of using modified limbs or mouthparts, some caddisfly larvae produce nets of silk used for filter feeding.

==Baleen whales==
The baleen whales (Mysticeti), one of two suborders of the Cetacea (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), are characterized by having baleen plates for filtering food from water, rather than teeth. This distinguishes them from the other suborder of cetaceans, the toothed whales (Odontoceti). The suborder contains four families and fourteen species. Baleen whales typically seek out a concentration of zooplankton, swim through it, either open-mouthed or gulping, and filter the prey from the water using their baleens. A baleen is a row of a large number of keratin plates attached to the upper jaw with a composition similar to those in human hair or fingernails. These plates are triangular in section with the largest, inward-facing side bearing fine hairs forming a filtering mat. Right whales are slow swimmers with large heads and mouths. Their baleen plates are narrow and very long — up to in bowheads — and accommodated inside the enlarged lower lip which fits onto the bowed upper jaw. As the right whale swims, a front gap between the two rows of baleen plates lets the water in together with the prey, while the baleens filter out the water. Rorquals such as the blue whale, in contrast, have smaller heads, are fast swimmers with short and broad baleen plates. To catch prey, they widely open their lower jaw — almost 90° — swim through a swarm gulping, while lowering their tongue so that the head&#x27;s ventral grooves expand and vastly increase the amount of water taken in. Baleen whales typically eat krill in polar or subpolar waters during summers, but can also take schooling fish, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. All baleen whales except the gray whale feed near the water surface, rarely diving deeper than or for extended periods. Gray whales live in shallow waters feeding primarily on bottom-living organisms such as amphipods.

==Bivalves==
Bivalves are aquatic molluscs which have two-part shells. Typically both shells (or valves) are symmetrical along the hinge line. The class has 30,000 species, including scallops, clams, oysters and mussels. Most bivalves are filter feeders (although some have taken up scavenging and predation), extracting organic matter from the sea in which they live. Nephridia, the shellfish version of kidneys, remove the waste material. Buried bivalves feed by extending a siphon to the surface. For example, oysters draw water in over their gills through the beating of cilia. Suspended food (phytoplankton, zooplankton, algae and other water-borne nutrients and particles) are trapped in the mucus of a gill, and from there are transported to the mouth, where they are eaten, digested and expelled as feces or pseudofeces. Each oyster filters up to five litres of water per hour. Scientists believe that the Chesapeake Bay&#x27;s once-flourishing oyster population historically filtered the estuary&#x27;s entire water volume of excess nutrients every three or four days. Today that process would take almost a year, and sediment, nutrients, and algae can cause problems in local waters. Oysters filter these pollutants, and either eat them or shape them into small packets that are deposited on the bottom where they are harmless.

Bivalve shellfish recycle nutrients that enter waterways from human and agricultural sources. Nutrient bioextraction is &quot;an environmental management strategy by which nutrients are removed from an aquatic ecosystem through the harvest of enhanced biological production, including the aquaculture of suspension-feeding shellfish or algae&quot;. Nutrient removal by shellfish, which are then harvested from the system, has the potential to help address environmental issues including excess inputs of nutrients (eutrophication), low dissolved oxygen, reduced light availability and impacts on eelgrass, harmful algal blooms, and increases in incidence of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). For example, the average harvested mussel contains: 0.8–1.2% nitrogen and 0.06–0.08% phosphorus Removal of enhanced biomass can not only combat eutrophication and also support the local economy by providing product for animal feed or compost. In Sweden, environmental agencies utilize mussel farming as a management tool in improving water quality conditions, where mussel bioextraction efforts have been evaluated and shown to be a highly effective source of fertilizer and animal feed In the U.S., researchers are investigating potential to model the use of shellfish and seaweed for nutrient mitigation in certain areas of Long Island Sound.

Bivalves are also largely used as bioindicators to monitor the health of an aquatic environment, either fresh- or seawater. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour, or their content of certain elements or compounds can reveal the contamination status of any aquatic ecosystem. They are useful as they are sessile, which means they are closely representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed (caging), and they breathe water all the time, exposing their gills and internal tissues: bioaccumulation. One of the most famous projects in that field is the Mussel Watch Programme in America.

==Sponges==
Sponges have no true circulatory system; instead, they create a water current which is used for circulation. Dissolved gases are brought to cells and enter the cells via simple diffusion. Metabolic wastes are also transferred to the water through diffusion. Sponges pump remarkable amounts of water. &quot;Leuconia&quot;, for example, is a small leuconoid sponge about 10 cm tall and 1 cm in diameter. It is estimated that water enters through more than 80,000 incurrent canals at a speed of 6 cm per minute. However, because &quot;Leuconia&quot; has more than 2 million flagellated chambers whose combined diameter is much greater than that of the canals, water flow through chambers slows to 3.6 cm per hour. Such a flow rate allows easy food capture by the collar cells. Water is expelled through a single osculum at a velocity of about 8.5 cm/second: a jet force capable of carrying waste products some distance away from the sponge.

==Cnidarians==
The moon jellyfish has a grid of fibres which are slowly pulled through the water. The motion is so slow that copepods cannot sense it and do not react with an escape response.

Other filter-feeding cnidarians include sea pens, sea fans, plumose anemones, and &quot;Xenia&quot;.

==Tunicates==
Tunicates, such as ascidians, salps and sea squirts, are chordates which form a sister group to the vertebrates. Nearly all tunicates are suspension feeders, capturing planktonic particles by filtering sea water through their bodies. Water is drawn into the body through the inhalant buccal siphon by the action of cilia lining the gill slits. The filtered water is then expelled through a separate exhalant siphon. To obtain enough food, a typical tunicate needs to process about one body-volume of water per second.

==Birds==
Flamingos filter-feed on brine shrimp. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they eat, and are uniquely used upside-down. The filtering of food items is assisted by hairy structures called lamellae which line the mandibles, and the large rough-surfaced tongue.

Prions are specialised petrels with filter-feeding habits. Their name comes from their saw-like jaw edges, used to scope out small planktionic animals.

The extinct swan &quot;Annakacygna&quot; is speculated to be a filter-feeder due to its bill proportions being similar to those of shoveler ducks. It is unique in being a large, flightless marine animal, unlike the smaller still volant flamingos and prions.

==Pterosaurs==
Traditionally, Ctenochasmatoidea as a group has been listed as filter-feeders, due to their long, multiple slender teeth, clearly well adapted to trap prey. However, only &quot;Pterodaustro&quot; showcases a proper pumping mechanism, having up-turned jaws and powerful jaw and tongue musculature. Other ctenochasmatoids lack these, and are now instead thought to have been spoonbill-like catchers, using their specialised teeth simply to offer a larger surface area. Tellingly, these teeth, while small and numerous, are comparatively unspecialised to the baleen-like teeth of &quot;Pterodaustro&quot;.

Boreopterids are thought to have relied on a kind of rudimentary filter feeding, using their long, slender teeth to trap small fish, though probably lacking the pumping mechanism of &quot;Pterodaustro&quot;. In essence, their foraging mechanism was similar to that of modern young &quot;Platanista&quot; &quot;dolphins&quot;.

==Marine reptiles==
Filter feeding habits are conspicuously rare among Mesozoic marine reptiles, the main filter feeding niche being seemingly instead occupied by pachycormid fish. However, some sauropsids have been suggested to have engaged in filter feeding. &quot;Henodus&quot; was a placodont with unique baleen-like denticles and features of the hyoid and jaw musculature comparable to those of flamingos. Combined with its lacustrine environment, it might have occupied a similar ecological niche. In particular, it was probably a herbivore, filtering out algae and other small-sized flora from the substrates.
Stomatosuchidae is a family of freshwater crocodylomorphs with rorqual-like jaws and minuscule teeth, and the unrelated Cenozoic &quot;Mourasuchus&quot; shares similar adaptations.
Hupehsuchia is a lineage of bizarre Triassic reptiles adapted for suspension feeding.
Some plesiosaurs might have had filter-feeding habits.

<text>The Egyptian Air Force (EAF) (), is the aviation branch of the Egyptian Armed Forces that is responsible for all airborne defence missions and operates all military aircraft, including those used in support of the Egyptian Army, Egyptian Navy and the Egyptian Air Defense Forces. The latter was created as a separate command in the 1970s and it coordinates with the Air Force to integrate air and ground-based air defense operations. The EAF is headed by an air marshal (lieutenant general equivalent). Currently, the commander of the Egyptian Air Force is Air Marshal Mahmoud Fouad Abdel-Gawad. The force&#x27;s motto is &#x27;Higher and higher for the sake of glory&#x27; (, &quot;&quot;). It was known as the Royal Egyptian Air Force until 18 June 1953 following the declaration of the Republic of Egypt by Muhammad Naguib.

The Egyptian Army Air Service was formed in 1932, and became an independent air force in 1937. It had little involvement in the Second World War. From 1948 to 1973 it took part in four separate wars with Israel, as well as the quasi-War of Attrition. It also supported the Egyptian Army during the North Yemen Civil War and the Libyan–Egyptian War of 1977. From 1977 to 2011 it saw virtually no combat, but has participated in numerous exercises, including Operation Bright Star. Since 1992 the EAF has also provided aviation support for the police and other national security organizations engaged in the war against terrorism. In recent years the Air Force has acted in the Sinai insurgency, the Second Libyan Civil War and the Intervention in the Yemen.

The EAF primary role is the air defence of the nation, with secondary tasks of strike and army support operations. The EAF provides official government transport and carries out international search-and- rescue operations in the desert, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Red Sea.

In 2023 the IISS estimated the total active manpower of the Egyptian Air Force at approximately 30,000 personnel, including 10,000 conscripts, with reserves of 20,000 personnel.

==History==

===Establishment (Royal Egyptian Air Force)===

In late 1928, the Parliament of Egypt proposed the creation of an Egyptian Air Force. The Egyptian ministry of war announced that it needed volunteers for the new arm to become the first four Egyptian military pilots. Over 200 Egyptian officers volunteered, but in the end only three succeeded in passing strict medical tests and technical examinations.

These three went to No. 4 Flying Training School RAF at RAF Station Abu Sueir near the Suez Canal, where they were trained on a variety of aircraft. After graduation, they traveled to the United Kingdom for specialised training.

On 2 November 1930, the King of Egypt and Sudan, Fuad I announced the creation of the Egyptian Army Air Force (EAAF). On 27 May 1931 the Egyptian Council of Ministers approved the purchase of five aircraft and the building of an airfield at Almaza (Cairo) with a budget of 50,000 pounds. The aircraft chosen was the British de Havilland Gipsy Moth trainer, the five modified aircraft were flown from England to Egypt and on arrival in May 1932 the air force was founded and the Almaza airfield was formally opened.

The first commander of the EAAF was Squadron Leader Victor Hubert Tait RAF, a Canadian, former Senior Air Advisor on the British Military Mission in Egypt. Tait selected staff, weapons and initiated building a number of airfields. In 1934 the British government provided ten Avro 626 aircraft, which were the first real Egyptian military planes. A further 17 626s together with Hawker Audaxes for army cooperation and close support and Avro Ansons for VIP work followed shortly afterward.

In 1937 the Egyptian Army Air Force was separated from the Army Command and became an independent branch named the Royal Egyptian Air Force (REAF). New stations were built in the Suez Canal Zone, and the Western Desert.

During 1938 the REAF received two squadrons (Nos 2 and 5) of Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters and No. 1 Squadron of Westland Lysander reconnaissance aircraft, Egypt was the last state to use the Lysander in action, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

===Second World War===
As the Egyptian border was threatened by an Italian and German invasion during the Second World War, the Royal Air Force established more airfields in Egypt. The Royal Egyptian Air Force was sometimes treated as a part of the Royal Air Force, at other times a strict policy of neutrality was followed as Egypt maintained its official neutrality until very late in the war. As a result, few additional aircraft were supplied by Britain, however the arm did receive its first modern fighters, Hawker Hurricanes and a small number of Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks. In the immediate post-war period, cheap war surplus aircraft, including a large number of Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IXs were acquired.

A 1946 order of battle for the Air Force can be found in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Aircraft of World War II,&quot; listing Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 Squadrons at Almaza Air Base, and No. 2 Squadron at Edku.

===1948 Arab–Israeli War===
Following the British withdrawal from the British Protectorate of Palestine and the establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, Egyptian forces crossed into Palestine as part of a wider Arab League military coalition in support of the Palestinians against the Israelis. The Egyptian Air Force contribution included the Short Stirling bomber, Douglas C-47 Dakotas performing as light bombers and Spitfires.

Two Israeli aircraft were shot down and on 22 May 1948, Egyptian Spitfires attacked the RAF Ramat David airfield, believing that it had already been taken over by Israeli forces. The first raid surprised the British, and resulted in the destruction of several RAF aircraft on the ground, and the deaths of four airmen. The British were uncertain whether the attacking Spitfires had come from Arab or Israeli forces. When second and third raids followed shortly afterwards, the British were ready and the entire Egyptian force was shot down – the last aircraft being baited for some time as the RAF pilots attempted to get a close look at its markings.

Relations with Britain were soon restored and the official state of war with Israel ensured that arms purchases continued. New Spitfire Mk. 22s were purchased to replace the earlier models. In late 1949, Egypt received its first jet fighter, the British Gloster Meteor F4 and shortly after de Havilland Vampire FB5s.

===Republican Egypt (Egyptian Air Force)===
In 1955, Egypt made an agreement to buy heavy arms from Czechoslovakia, culminating four years of attempts. The Egyptian Government was determined to move away from reliance on British armaments. 1951 discussions had included 60–100 Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighters. Initial Soviet bloc deliveries included the MiG-15s, Ilyushin Il-28 bombers, Ilyushin Il-14 transports, and Yak-11 trainers. Instructors from Czechoslovakia accompanied these aircraft. Egypt also began manufacturing its own Czechoslovak-designed Heliopolis Gomhouria (originally the German Bü 181 Bestmann) primary trainers at this time.

===Suez Crisis===

After the Egyptian Government&#x27;s nationalisation of the Suez Canal in 1956, Egypt was attacked by Israel, France, and the United Kingdom in what came to be known as the Suez Crisis (&quot;Tripartite Aggression&quot; in Egypt). Heavy losses were sustained by the Egyptian side. After U.S. pressure, the French and British withdrew their forces after seizing the city of Suez. The war also forced the EAF to begin rebuilding without British help.

In 1958, Egypt merged with Syria to form the United Arab Republic, and the previously separate Egyptian and Syrian forces were combined as the United Arab Republic Air Force. Though Syria left the union in 1961, Egypt continued to use the union&#x27;s official name until 1971, including for its air force.
One of the first Egyptian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 units was the 15th Air Brigade, consisting of Nos 20 and 21 Squadrons, which became operational at Fayid with a forward location at Milayz in the early 1960s.

By the mid-1960s, British aircraft had been replaced completely by Soviet hardware. The Soviet Union became the principal supplier of the EAF, and many other Arab states. This allowed the EAF to greatly modernise and boost its combat effectiveness. The MiG-21 Fishbed arrived in the early 1960s, bringing with it a Mach 2 capability. The MiG-21 would remain Egypt&#x27;s primary fighter for the next two decades. The EAF also began flying the Sukhoi Su-7 fighter/bomber in the mid-1960s. By 1966, Air Group 65, with its primary base at Cairo West Air Base, was operating three squadrons of Tupolev Tu-16 &quot;Badgers&quot;: No. 34 and 36 Squadrons with bomber variants, and No. 95 Squadron equipped with the Tu-16KS&#x27; that could carry AS-1 Kennel air-to-surface missiles. In 1967, Egypt had 200 MiG-21s.

Egypt also took over the Helwan HA-300 from Spain as its first supersonic aircraft. It never went beyond three prototypes and initial test flights, then was abandoned due to high costs and political factors. The German designers involved had to leave Egypt after death threats from the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.

===Yemen War===

The Yemeni Royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia and Jordan, while the Yemeni Republicans were supported by Egypt. The fighting was fierce, featuring heavy urban combat as well as battles in the countryside. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved.

Strategically, the Yemen War was an opportunity for Israel. It stagnated Egyptian military plans for the reinforcement of Sinai, by shifting the Egyptian military focus to another theater of operation. Egyptian historian Mohammed Heikal writes that Israel provided arms shipments and also cultivated relationships with hundreds of European mercenaries fighting for the Royalists in Yemen. Israel established a covert air-supply bridge from Djibouti to North Yemen. The war also gave the Israelis the opportunity to assess Egyptian combat tactics and adaptability.

Egyptian air and naval forces began bombing and shelling raids in the Saudi southwestern city of Najran and the coastal town of Jizan, which were staging points for royalist forces. In response, the Saudis purchased British Thunderbird surface-to-air missiles and developed their King Khalid airfield near Khamis Mushait. Riyadh also attempted to convince the United States to respond on its behalf. In Operation Hard Surface, President Kennedy sent jet fighters and bombers to Dhahran Air Base from May 1963, demonstrating to Egypt the seriousness of his commitment to defending U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia.

===Six-Day War===

In the 1967 Six-Day War the EAF&#x27;s combat capacity was severely damaged after the Israeli Air Force destroyed its air bases in a preemptive strike codenamed Operation Focus. During the last four days the EAF conducted only 150 sorties against Israeli units throughout the Sinai. After the war, the Soviet Union replenished EAF stocks, sending large numbers of aircraft and advisors to Egypt to revitalise the EAF.

The EAF&#x27;s first air-to-air victory is claimed by MiG-21 pilot Nabil Shoukry against a Mirage IIICJ fighter over Inchas air base two hours following the first Israeli strike.

On 8 June 1967, a pair of Egyptian MiG-21s engaged a pair of Mirage IIIs over the Sinai. In the ensuing dogfight, the EAF&#x27;s 1st Lt Fakhry El-Ashmawy managed to down one of the Mirage fighters while the second Mirage crashed from fuel exhaustion.

Initial Egyptian claims were even more inflated, but were later reduced to 72 Israeli aircraft destroyed. The IDF/AF admitted 45 losses on all fronts, while outside observers put the figure between 55 and 60. Years later, unofficial Israelis sources admitted ten IDF/AF aircraft downed in air combat on all fronts. Independent sources put this figure at 11, plus another resulting in fuel exhaustion. In fact, several Israeli aircraft reportedly downed by ground fire probably fell to Egyptian fighters.

===Nigerian Civil War===
During the Nigerian Civil War, Nigeria received air support from pilots of the Egyptian Air Force, who launched air raids against the self-declared republic of Biafra. The Egyptian pilots flew aircraft procured by the Soviet Union, air force Mikoyan MiG-17 fighters and Ilyushin Il-28 bombers.

===War of Attrition===
The years between 1967 and 1970 involved a prolonged campaign of attrition against Israel. The EAF went through a massive construction program to build new air bases in order to increase its survivability. During this period Egypt also received replacements for losses it suffered during the Six Day War. The EAF was the first branch of the Egyptian armed forces to achieve full combat readiness.

On 15 July 1967, six Israeli Mirage III fighters violated Egyptian airspace and orders were given for two formations each consisted of two MiG-21 fighters to intercept, another formation of 2 MiGs piloted by Major Fawzy Salama &amp; Lieutenant Medhat Zaki was ready in West Cairo airbase. Indeed, the formation took off, but for protecting the airbase rather than supporting the interception.

===October War 1973===

During the initial surprise air attack of the Yom Kippur War, over 220 EAF aircraft took part. Unlike their Syrian counterparts, EAF aircraft evaded Israeli radars by flying below detection height. EAF aircraft were held in reserve after that point, mainly concentrating on airfield defence in conjunction with the SA-3 &#x27;Goa&#x27;, while the more mobile SA-6 &#x27;Gainful&#x27; protected Egyptian forces at low and medium level, aided by the ZSU-23-4 and shoulder-held SA-7 SAMs.

Despite these limitations, the EAF conducted offensive sorties from time to time. The Su-7BM was used for quick strafe attacks on Israeli columns and the Mirage IIIE (sometimes confused with the Mirage 5), donated by Libya, carried out long-range attacks deep inside Sinai at Bir Gifgafa.

However, when Israeli armoured forces used a gap between the two Egyptian armies to cross the Suez Canal (Operation Stouthearted Men), they destroyed several Egyptian SAM sites, forcing the EAF into battle against the IAF. The EAF claimed victories and continued to contest IAF operations, while also launching attacks on Israeli ground forces on the East Bank of the Suez Canal. In most of these engagements, Egyptian MiG-21s (of all types) challenged Israeli Mirage IIICJs or Neshers.

The IAF did not operate freely and did not have complete air supremacy it enjoyed during the previous conflict, the 1967 war. Egyptian MiGs were used with better efficiency than before which included the tactics and lessons learned from the 1967 war.

It was during this war that the EAF applied the lessons it earlier learnt from the Israelis. A 32-year-old deputy MiG-21 regiment commander who has been flying since he was 15 recalls:
&quot;During the war of attrition, the Israeli air force had a favorite ambush tactic&quot;, he told Aviation Week and Space Technology. &quot;They would penetrate with two aircraft at medium altitude where they would be quickly picked up by radar, We would scramble four or eight to attack them. But they had another dozen fighters trailing at extremely low altitude below radar coverage. As we climbed to the attack they would zoom up behind and surprise us. My regiment lost MiGs to this ambush tactic three times. But we learned the lesson and practiced the same tactics. In the final fights over Deversoir, we ambushed some Mirages the same way, and my own &#x27;finger four&#x27; formation shot down four Mirages with the loss of one MiG.&quot;

The Egyptian Air Force commander during the war was then-Air Marshal Hosni Mubarak. On 14 October 1973 one of many Egyptian/Israeli air engagements took place. Initial Egyptian reports that 15 Israeli aircraft had been destroyed. on the day of &quot;Air battle of Mansoura&quot;. Later on, the Egyptian government changed the country&#x27;s &quot;Air Force Day&quot; from 2 November to 14 October, to commemorate the Mansourah air battle. Mubarak was even promoted and feted as a national hero after the war, It was estimated that over 2200 take offs were done by the Egyptian Air Force throughout the war that included dogfighting and ground attacks.

===Shaba I===
During the Shaba I crisis in Zaire on 1977, Egyptian Air Force provided 50 pilots and technicians, who operated Mirage jets for the Zairian Air Force.

===Libyan–Egyptian War===

During the 1977 Libyan–Egyptian War, there were some skirmishes between Libyan and Egyptian fighters. In one instance, two Libyan Air Force MiG-23MS engaged two EAF MiG-21MFs that had been upgraded to carry Western weaponry. The Libyan pilots made the mistake of trying to manoeuvre with the more nimble Egyptian fighters, and one MiG-23MS was shot down by EAF Maj. Sal Mohammad, while the other Libyan aircraft used its speed advantage to escape.

===Camp David Accords and Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty===
Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin signed the Camp David Accords, Egypt would receive US$1.3 Billion military aid while Israel would receive US$3.1 Billion in aid. Ever since Egypt signed its peace treaty with Israel, Egypt shifted to American weaponry and drifted away from the Soviet style weapons. In March 1982, Egypt received its first 12 F-16 fighter Jets for its inventory.

From 1980 the EAF was involved in the joint U.S.-Egyptian biannual Exercise Bright Star.

===Sinai Insurgency===
The Egyptian Air Force operated on a large scale during the Sinai insurgency which commenced in 2011. AH-64 Apache helicopters and F-16 jet fighters bombed numerous militant targets on almost a daily basis.

===Second Libyan Civil War===
During the Second Libyan Civil War there were conflicting reports that Egyptian warplanes bombed Islamist militias in support of the government based in Tobruk. The foreign ministry denied any involvement in the conflict although unnamed Egyptian military officials claimed otherwise. Egypt tightened security on Libyan border following mysterious air strikes. Egyptian forces near the Libyan border have been put on high alert following airstrikes on Jan 10 from unidentified fighter jets inside Libya. The fighter jets struck Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) targets inside Libya, according to news reports. The Libyan coastal city of Sirte has served as ISIL&#x27;s capital in North Africa since the terror group seized the city last summer.

After receiving three MiG-21MFs and three Mi-8s from Egypt just half a year ago, it appears the Libyan Air Force is now further strengthened by two MiG-21MFs from the same source. The former EAF mounts are a welcome addition to the under-equipped Libyan Air Force, which is currently waging a war against Libya Dawn, Ansar al-Sharia and even the Islamic State, the latter centered around the Libyan city of Derna.

On 6 March 2016, Egypt and France began on Sunday a joint military exercise termed as the &quot;Ramses-2016&quot; in the coastal city of Alexandria along the Mediterranean. The French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle is steaming through the Red Sea on its way to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal for joint maneuvers with the Egyptian air force and navy in preparation for a reduced coalition offensive against Islamic State&#x27;s deepening grip on Libya.

===2015 Airstrikes in Libya===
The February 2015 Egyptian airstrikes in Libya against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) positions in Libya took place on 16 February 2015, and were triggered by a video released by ISIL in Libya a day earlier, depicting the beheading of 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt.

Within hours, the Egyptian Air Force responded with airstrikes against ISIL training camps and weapons stockpiles in retaliation for the killings. Warplanes acting under orders from the Libyan government also struck targets in Derna, reportedly in coordination with Egypt. It is believed that more than eight EAF F-16 jet fighters were used for the strikes, including the newly joined &quot;block 52&quot; variants.

The airstrikes had allegedly killed up to 81 ISIL militants, including three of the leadership, in the coastal cities of Derna and Sirte. Libyan media reported that at least 35 more Egyptians had been rounded up by ISIL in retaliation for the air raids.
===2015 Military Intervention in Yemen===
Egyptian Air Forces are participating in a Saudi-led joint regional military operation to halt the advance of Houthi rebels in Yemen, Egypt&#x27;s presidency announced on 2015 March 25 in a statement. the Egyptian Air Force participated in airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen.

Egypt&#x27;s military participation &quot;through elements of the Egyptian air and navy forces&quot; aims to support the Saudi-led regional coalition to restore stability in Yemen &quot;under legitimate leadership&quot;, according to the Egyptian presidency&#x27;s statement.

The Egyptian air force supported pro-government forces when they attacked Al Anad Air Base in the south of Yemen. &quot;EAF and paratroopers aerial supported Yemeni ground forces who have now seized the military base killing scores of Houthi rebels&quot;.

===2017 Airstrikes in Libya===

On May 26, 2017, armed men traveling in pickup trucks gunned down 28 Coptic Christians and wounded 26 as the Christians were on their way to visit a monastery in Egypt’s Minya province, The Islamic State claimed responsibility for this attack. That same evening, Egypt announced that its air force had carried out six air raids on ISIS camps near the Libyan city of Derna. The strikes involved F-16C/D Block 52s covered by at least two Dassault Rafales.

===Silver Stars Aerobatic Team===

Silver Stars is the Egyptian Air Force aerobatic display team flying 10 K-8E Karakorum jet trainer aircraft painted in white, red and black colors. All planes are equipped with red, white and black smoke generators. During the shows, the Silver Stars performs eight different formations along with several single aircraft passes. Aircraft #6325 (Star 1) carries the name &quot;Sharaf&quot; after the team leader. Another team&#x27;s planes also carried the pilots names painted at the K-8 nose. All pilots are flying instructors at the Egyptian Air Academy based in Belbeis Airport.

The Egyptian Air Force demonstration team &quot;The Silver Stars&quot; was formed in the mid of 1974 to participate at &quot;October War&quot; anniversary. Pilots of the team were flying instructors at the Air force College and flew four L-29 planes painted in dark green and brown and yellow – standard color scheme. In 1984, the Sliver Stars aerobatic team switched to six Alpha Jet training airplanes. In the following year, team&#x27;s planes became nine.
In 2003, the team made the switch to the K-8E Karakorum trainer and from 2005 was led by Group Captain Mostafa Fathi.
Since 2010, the team is now flying ten aircraft – nine plus one solo.

==Aircraft==
The Camp David Accords caused a gradual change in the overall composition of the EAF. The EAF began to rely more on US, French and in some cases on Chinese aircraft.

The addition of these aircraft from multiple sources along with the ones already in the EAF inventory caused increasing serviceability problems. In 1982, the EAF began receiving General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters under the Peace Vector Program. Turkish Aerospace / TUSAS produced 46 F-16s for the Egyptian Air Force between 1993 and 1995 under the agreement signed between the Governments of Turkey and the Arab Republic of Egypt. As of 2015, the EAF received a total of 220 F-16s. 18 aircraft were lost in accidents and 7 F-16A/Bs were grounded.

These grounded F-16A/Bs were later overhauled, upgraded and returned to active service, additional F-16s were acquired to replace those lost. In 1986, the EAF received the French Mirage 2000 fighters, one was lost in a training accident. Egypt also license-built Alphajets, Tucano airplanes and Westland Gazelle helicopters.

In 1987 the E-2C Hawkeye Airborne Early Warning (AEW) entered service and was upgraded with advanced AN/APS-145 radars. The EAF also upgraded its F-16 fighters to C/D standard that enabled them to fire the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile.

The EAF currently operates 46 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters 36 of which were initially delivered as the AH-64A variant but were later upgraded to AH-64D standard. On 22 May 2009, Egypt requested the purchase of 36 Apache Arrowhead sensor systems as part of an order for 12 Block II AH-64D Apache helicopters. The number was later reduced to 10 Helicopters. 74 Grob G-115&#x27;s and 120 K-8 Karakorum trainers were also ordered.

===Modernization===
Egypt made several deals with Ukrainian companies for the modernization of its old MiG-21 fleet but these deals were not implemented, and all old MiG-21 fighters were taken out of service.

On 3 March 2010, the EAF ordered 20 Lockheed Martin F-16C/D Block 52 aircraft. The contract was set to complete in 2013 and included 16 single-seat F-16C and four twin-seat F-16D aircraft.
On 14 August 2012, the US Defense Department awarded a major contract to facilitate the procurement of F-16s by the EAF. The Pentagon selected American International Contractors for a $66.6 million contract to upgrade infrastructure for Egypt&#x27;s order of 20 F-16 Block 52 aircraft, estimated at $2.2 billion. On 24 July 2013, the U.S. announced it would halt deliveries of the F-16s in response to the 2013 Egyptian coup d&#x27;état. In March 2015 the US announced the resumption of the deliveries of the F-16s, the last of which was delivered in October 2015.

On 16 February 2015, Egypt became the Dassault Rafale&#x27;s first international customer when it officially ordered 24 Rafales, as part of a larger deal (including a FREMM multipurpose frigate and a supply of missiles) worth US$5.9 billion (€5.2 billion). In July 2015, the official ceremony, marking the acceptance by Egypt of its first 3 Rafales, was held at the Dassault Aviation flight test center in Istres. In January 2016, Egypt received three more Rafale fighters, raising the number of Rafales in service to six. All six aircraft are two-seat models and were diverted from delivery to the French Air Force; Egypt&#x27;s total 24-plane order is for 8 single-seat models and 16 two-seaters.

In April 2014, it was reported that Egypt planned to order 24 MiG-35 fighters as part of an arms deal with Russia. MiG head Sergei Korotkov said at the 2015 Aero India exposition they will provide the fighters if Egypt orders them and are ready to negotiate. Russia agreed on a contract with Egypt for 46 MiG-29M/M2 fighters and it was expected to be worth up to US$2 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;46 MiG-29M/M2s&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Russia planned to supply the Egyptian MiG-29M/M2s with 40 high precision targeting pods. Deliveries would have begun in 2016.
SAGEM and AOI-Aircraft Factory signed a collaboration agreement concerning the Patroller UAV. AOI-Aircraft Factory could handle final assembly of the drones and developed a dedicated training center in Egypt to train staff for the operation and maintenance of the drone systems.

On 18 April 2016, Egypt signed a contract with France for the sale of a military telecommunications satellite after discussions between the Egyptian and French presidents and between the Ministers of Defense, which took place during a visit by French President Francois Hollande to Cairo. The satellite were supplied by Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space. The price of the contract wasn&#x27;t announced but was estimated at 600 million euros.

In September 2016, Russian Helicopters delivered the first 3 refurbished Mi-8T helicopters to the Egyptian Air Force after a major overhaul. The company also announced that the necessary equipment for the retooling and upgrading of the Helwan Factory aircraft repair plant had been prepared for shipment and that the Egyptian service technicians had completed training.

In August 2019, the Royal Jordanian Air Force transferred two of its Ilyushin Il-76MF aircraft to the Egyptian Air Force. The two aircraft are unique because they are the only stretched version of the famous Il-76 air-frame.

On 4 May 2021, France agreed to sell Egypt an additional 30 Dassault Rafale warplanes in a 4 billion euro (US$4.8 billion) deal.

On 15 March 2022, the United States agreed to sell Egypt variants of F-15Es, the offer&#x27;s amount of planes and price is to be determined.

===Future===
In 2014, Egypt planned to sign a large arms deal with Russia for the purchase of 24 MiG-35 fighter jets. In February 2015, MiG Director General Sergei Korotkov announced that the company was ready to supply the MiG-35 jets to Egypt should the country request them. However, in April 2015, Egypt signed a $2 billion contract for the purchase of 46 MiG-29M/M2 multi-role fighters instead.

Rosoboronexport and the Russian Helicopters holding are engaged in consultations with their Egyptian partners concerning a possible acquisition of Kamov Ka-52K ship-based helicopters for the 2 Mistral-class helicopter carriers that Egypt has agreed to buy from France. An Egyptian Air Force delegation had access to the helicopter before the official opening of the MAKS-2015.

In March 2019, it was reported that Egypt had reached an initial agreement with Russia for the sale of &quot;over 20&quot; Su-35 air superiority fighters in a deal valued at about US$2 billion. Deliveries were expected to begin as early as 2020 or 2021. However, deputy head of the Rosoboronexport Sergei Kornev denied any contract regarding the supply of Su-35 fighters to Egypt has been signed. In May 2020 Russia reportedly started producing the Su-35 under a contract with Egypt that was signed in 2018. Pictures taken in July 2020 reportedly showed five Su-35 in EAF camouflage on their delivery voyage. There was also a possibility of future orders for more Su-35 and the new MiG-35.

As of January 5, 2022, Egypt, Algeria, and Indonesia have cancelled plans of purchasing the Su-35.

On March 15, 2022, The United States offered to sell the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle to Egypt. The offer&#x27;s amount of planes and price is to be determined.

===Munitions===
==Aircraft insignia==
The roundel of the EAF consists of three circles, with the outside one being red, the middle one white, and the inner one being black, matching the Egyptian flag. Former roundels of the EAF included a similar variant with two green stars used from 1961 to 1973, and one with the old Egyptian crescent and three stars on a green background. Changes in markings reflect political changes.

===Humanitarian and peacekeeping missions===
The RJAF has played an increasingly active role in peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance. Despite limited resources, Jordan has committed its air force to peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions across various continents. In 1994, the RJAF began participating in United Nations airlift operations, supporting Jordanian troops on peacekeeping assignments. As of recent years, the RJAF has logged over 200 flight hours in peacekeeping support worldwide.

==History==

===Early foundations and British influence (1931–1955)===

Jordan gained independence in 1946, but its first air bases were established as early as 1931 by the Royal Air Force to protect British interests and maintain stability in the region. Initially, Jordan’s air defense was limited to observation and reconnaissance, with British personnel assisting in the development of this early force. By 1948, Jordan began forming a small air unit known as the Arab Legion Air Force (ALAF), with assistance from the RAF in terms of training and equipment. The ALAF&#x27;s primary fighter aircraft was the de Havilland Vampire, a British jet fighter, and a Vickers VC.1 Viking was used as a VIP transport for the King of Jordan. 

In 1955, King Hussein recognized the need for a more autonomous and capable air force as part of Jordan’s modernization goals, officially establishing the RJAF on 25 September 1955. The same year, Jordan received its first modern training aircraft from the United Kingdom, solidifying early efforts in pilot training and technical skills. By 1958, British forces had fully departed Jordan, and the RJAF assumed complete control over the nation’s airfields, marking a shift toward self-reliance.

===The Six-Day War and aftermath (1960s)===
In the early 1960s, the RJAF expanded its capabilities with the acquisition of Hawker Hunter aircraft for air defense, strengthening Jordan&#x27;s combat abilities as regional tensions mounted. In December 1964, the RJAF engaged in a notable air combat incident over the West Bank, where four Israeli Air Force Mirages encountered RJAF Hunters, resulting in damage to one Mirage with no Jordanian losses. The RJAF’s role during the Six-Day War in 1967 was met with severe challenges as Israeli air raids destroyed most of Jordan’s aircraft on the ground, resulting in the near-total loss of the fleet. Despite these losses, the RJAF quickly began efforts to rebuild, receiving assistance from the United Kingdom, which provided additional Hunters and training support.

===Modernization and regional alignments (1970s)===

After the heavy losses of the 1967 war, the RJAF undertook substantial modernization efforts. In the early 1970s, it acquired Lockheed F-104 Starfighters from the United States, although these were later deemed unsuitable for Jordan’s defense needs due to their high operational costs and maintenance complexity. By 1977, these were transferred to the Pakistan Air Force, leaving the RJAF to seek alternative solutions. 

During this period, the RJAF also procured Northrop F-5 Tiger jets from Iran, as part of Jordan’s strategic alliance with Iran during the Shah’s reign. These aircraft became vital to Jordan’s defense strategy, enabling a higher degree of regional operational capacity. Additionally, the RJAF began using Cessna T-37 Tweets for advanced training, which helped establish a domestic pipeline for skilled pilots and technical staff. In 1975, the RJAF retired its fleet of Hawker Hunters, transferring them to the Omani Air Force after unsuccessful attempts to sell the aircraft elsewhere.

===The Iran-Iraq War and continued upgrades (1980s)===
Following the Egypt–Israel peace treaty in 1979, the RJAF embarked on further modernization efforts supported by financial aid from several Arab states. The RJAF selected the Dassault Mirage F1 over the General Dynamics F-16/79 to serve as its frontline fighter due to its advanced avionics and agility in air-to-air combat. 

During the Iran-Iraq War, Jordan remained a regional ally of Iraq, providing training support for Iraqi pilots. The RJAF participated in joint training exercises, allowing Jordanian and Iraqi pilots to operate side-by-side in combat simulations. However, there is no confirmed evidence that RJAF personnel directly engaged in combat missions. During this period, the RJAF also acquired Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, which became instrumental in supporting Jordan’s international peacekeeping missions, as well as humanitarian efforts throughout the Middle East and North Africa.

===The Gulf War and resource constraints (1990s)===
Jordan’s complex political relationship with Iraq during the Gulf War left the RJAF in a difficult position, as Jordan chose not to commit forces to combat. However, the aftermath of the war led to economic strains that impacted the RJAF, resulting in a shift towards modernization through upgrades rather than acquiring new aircraft. In a bid to sustain operational readiness, the RJAF sold seven of its F-5E jets to Singapore, utilizing the proceeds to fund upgrades to its remaining fleet. This included the installation of the AN/APG-67 radar, advanced fire control systems, and upgraded weapons systems, which allowed the F-5s to maintain relevance in modern air combat despite lacking beyond-visual-range capabilities.

By the late 1990s, the RJAF had established itself as a capable regional air force focused on maintaining a balance between operational readiness and cost-effectiveness. Continued support from international allies, including the United States and NATO members, played a significant role in helping Jordan sustain its air defense infrastructure amid limited resources.

===Modern era===
Following the Gulf War, the Royal Jordanian Air Force (RJAF) initiated a broad modernization program to address regional security challenges and enhance its strategic capabilities. As part of these efforts, Jordan acquired a range of transport, combat, and special operations aircraft.

In the early 1990s, Jordan procured two Airbus C-295 light transport aircraft to support logistics and tactical operations. The acquisition of several Antonov An-32 aircraft from Ukraine provided the RJAF with enhanced STOL capabilities, allowing rapid transport for the Royal Special Forces in remote or challenging environments. However, the operational status of the An-32s has been uncertain in recent years, with the focus shifting to newer models. In 1997, Jordan further enhanced its tactical airlift with the addition of a Lockheed C-130 Hercules, critical for both domestic operations and regional humanitarian missions.
To improve heavy lift and logistics capabilities, the RJAF acquired two Ilyushin Il-76MF freighters from Russia in 2006. These aircraft have been instrumental in supporting Jordan’s extensive peacekeeping missions and other international deployments. Additionally, the RJAF began to explore multi-role gunships, converting two CASA/IPTN CN-235 aircraft into AC235 gunships in collaboration with the King Abdullah II Design and Development Bureau (KADDB) and U.S. defense company Orbital ATK. These gunships, equipped with advanced sensors and precision weaponry, are intended to support special operations and counter-insurgency efforts. The RJAF later explored the gunship version of the Airbus C-295 to further expand its close air support capabilities.

The Jordanian Special Operations Aviation Brigade, created to support high-priority missions, has operated Sikorsky UH-60L Black Hawk and MD Helicopters MD-530F helicopters for special operations and border security missions. In the late 1990s, the RJAF received two squadrons of AH-1F Cobra gunships from the U.S. Army, later transferring some to Pakistan as Jordan transitioned to new platforms, including the Boeing AH-6 light attack helicopter.

Under the U.S. Military Assistance Program, Jordan received 18 surplus Bell UH-1H helicopters in 1994, followed by an additional 18 in 1996. The UH-1H helicopters were subsequently transferred to the Iraqi Air Force as Jordan moved to acquire newer platforms. In recent years, Jordan acquired eight UH-60A Black Hawks through a U.S. no-cost lease, and a further eight UH-60M Black Hawks were delivered in 2017 as part of a U.S. grant valued at $200 million.

The RJAF maintains close military cooperation with neighboring air forces, providing training for Bahraini pilots and logistical support to the Iraqi Air Force. The RJAF also plays a critical role in joint operations with the United States Air Force, conducting routine exercises to enhance regional interoperability and readiness. The current commander of the Royal Jordanian Air Force is Brigadier General Mohammad Hyasat.

===Operations in Syria and regional conflicts (2014–present)===

The RJAF has been active in regional conflicts, notably in the fight against ISIS and other terrorist organizations in Syria. On 16 April 2014, Jordanian fighter jets conducted airstrikes on vehicles attempting to cross from Syria into Jordan. The following September, the RJAF joined U.S.-led Operation Inherent Resolve airstrikes against ISIS, marking Jordan&#x27;s commitment to regional security.

In December 2014, a Jordanian F-16 crashed near Raqqa, Syria, resulting in the capture of the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Moaz Youssef al-Kasasbeh, by ISIS militants. Despite diplomatic efforts, al-Kasasbeh was executed in early 2015, leading to a renewed commitment by Jordan against ISIS. On 5 February 2015, the RJAF launched intensified strikes against ISIS positions in Syria, deploying 20 F-16s in operations supported by U.S.-supplied munitions, including JDAM precision bombs.

In 2015, Israel transferred 16 Bell AH-1E/F Cobras to Jordan, further bolstering the RJAF’s counterinsurgency capabilities along Jordan’s borders. While active in Syria, in late 2015 the RJAF shifted some resources to support Saudi-led operations against Houthi rebels in Yemen, although Jordan maintained a limited presence in Syria.

In late January 2024, the Royal Jordanian Air Force was actively involved in a coordinated response following the Tower 22 drone attack on a U.S. base in northeastern Jordan. This attack, attributed to an Iranian-supplied drone launched by Iranian-backed militias, resulted in the deaths of three American soldiers and injured over 40 others. The drone struck Tower 22, a logistics and support base near the Syrian border, underscoring the increasing threats posed by regional militias. 

On February 3, 2024, as part of the U.S.-led retaliation, RJAF F-16s joined American B-1B bombers and other aircraft in a series of airstrikes targeting strategic militia positions across Syria and Iraq. The operation, involving over 125 precision-guided munitions, was aimed at weakening the operational capabilities of the militias responsible for the Tower 22 attack. The RJAF provided air support along the Syria-Iraq border, focusing on surveillance and striking secondary targets to limit militia movements and escape routes.

In Syria, the strikes targeted several high-value facilities in Deir ez-Zor and al-Bukamal, including weapons depots, intelligence centers, and militia command posts affiliated with pro-Iranian forces. These locations served as vital hubs for arms and personnel, enabling cross-border operations by militias. The RJAF&#x27;s involvement marked its expanded role in regional counterterrorism and security efforts, signaling its commitment to supporting coalition forces against Iranian influence.

RJAF’s role in these strikes highlighted Jordan’s expanding security alliance with the United States, reflecting a proactive stance on countering threats from Iranian-aligned militias. Analysts have noted that this operation demonstrates Jordan’s strategic importance in regional security, as well as the RJAF’s growing capacity to participate in complex, multilateral defense operations.

===Humanitarian airlifts to Gaza (2023–present)===
In response to the humanitarian crisis during the war in Gaza, the RJAF coordinated critical aid missions to deliver supplies to affected areas. As part of Jordan’s commitment to supporting Palestinian civilians, the RJAF carried out multiple air drops of food, medical supplies, and essential relief items to Gaza, under challenging conditions and amidst ongoing regional conflict. This mission underscored Jordan’s role in regional humanitarian assistance, with the RJAF working closely with international agencies to ensure safe passage and distribution of aid.

Through these operations, the RJAF continues to fulfill its dual mission of national defense and regional support, showcasing its versatility and commitment to both security and humanitarian principles.

=== Future developments ===
The Royal Jordanian Air Force has been on a dynamic journey of modernization, acquiring new aircraft, phasing out older models, and pushing forward with advanced upgrades to maintain an edge in the region. Here’s a timeline of RJAF’s recent strategic advancements and milestones:

On 24 July 2019, the RJAF Commander, Major General Yousef Huneiti, received a significant promotion to serve as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Jordanian Armed Forces, underscoring his valuable contributions to Jordan&#x27;s military. Brigadier General Zaid Al-Najrish was appointed as the new Commander of the RJAF, with a commitment to continue the path of professionalism established by his predecessor.

On 3 March 2020, news broke that the RJAF had shifted its plans from upgrading older F-16s to procuring the latest F-16 Block 70/72 models. The RJAF aimed to replace its aging fleet with these state-of-the-art fighters featuring advanced radar, enhanced avionics, and extended capabilities.

In September 2020, the RJAF began working closely with the U.S. Air Force’s Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio on a study for the Block-70 operational upgrade program.

On 28 July 2021, the RJAF unveiled its upgraded F-16 MLU (Mid-Life Upgrade) fighters, which have been enhanced to MLU levels 5 and 6.5. This upgrade is approximately equivalent to the capabilities of the F-16C/D Block 50/52 series, equipping the jets with advanced munitions like GBU bombs, JDAM kits, AAM, and ASM weapons, as well as targeting and reconnaissance pods. The Ministry of Defense showcased the RJAF pilots training on these upgraded aircraft.

Following these upgrades, on 14 November 2021, it was announced that the latest F-16 MLU 6.5 fighters were painted with Glass V Paint, a radar-absorbent coating designed to enhance the aircraft’s stealth capabilities. This paint is part of Jordan&#x27;s strategy to bolster the survivability of its F-16 fleet in a high-threat environment.

On 3 February 2022, the United States Department of State authorized a potential Foreign Military Sale of up to 16 F-16 C/D Block 70 aircraft to Jordan, valued at approximately $4.21 billion. This includes a mix of 12 single-seat F-16Cs and four twin-seat F-16Ds, along with 21 F100 engines (with five spares) and additional systems and armament.

As part of its long-term modernization strategy, in January 2023, the RJAF confirmed the phased retirement of older aircraft types while prioritizing the F-16 Block 70 deliveries expected to begin in late 2024. The Block 70, known for its AESA radar and advanced avionics, will bring a significant boost in both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities.

In March 2024, the RJAF unveiled its enhanced fleet readiness, stating that it had increased operational training hours in preparation for the arrival of the Block 70s.

The RJAF’s modernization continues into November 2024, with the first batch of F-16 Block 70s anticipated by year’s end. This acquisition will cement Jordan’s air superiority role in the region, equipping it with a versatile fighter capable of handling modern threats across a range of mission profiles.

<doc id="377734" wikidata="Q1651205" url="?curid=377734" title="Torpor">
<text>Torpor is a state of decreased physiological activity in an animal, usually marked by a reduced body temperature and metabolic rate. Torpor enables animals to survive periods of reduced food availability. The term &quot;torpor&quot; can refer to the time a hibernator spends at low body temperature, lasting days to weeks, or it can refer to a period of low body temperature and metabolism lasting less than 24 hours, as in &quot;daily torpor&quot;.

Animals that undergo daily torpor include birds (even tiny hummingbirds, notably Cypselomorphae)
and some mammals, including many marsupial species, rodent species (such as mice), and bats.
During the active part of their day, such animals maintain normal body temperature and activity levels, but their metabolic rate and body temperature drop during a portion of the day (usually night) to conserve energy.

Some animals seasonally go into long periods of inactivity, with reduced body temperature and metabolism, made up of multiple bouts of torpor. This is known as hibernation if it occurs during winter or aestivation if it occurs during the summer. Daily torpor, on the other hand, is not seasonally dependent and can be an important part of energy conservation at any time of year.

Torpor is a well-controlled thermoregulatory process and not, as previously thought, the result of switching off thermoregulation.
Marsupial torpor differs from non-marsupial mammalian (eutherian) torpor in the characteristics of arousal. Eutherian arousal relies on a heat-producing brown adipose tissue as a mechanism to accelerate rewarming. The mechanism of marsupial arousal is unknown, but appears not to rely on brown adipose tissue.

== Evolution ==
The evolution of torpor likely accompanied the development of homeothermy. Animals are capable of maintaining a body temperature above ambient temperature when other members of its species would not have a fitness advantage. Benefits of maintaining internal temperatures include increased foraging time and less susceptibility to extreme drops in temperature. This adaptation of increasing body temperature to forage has been observed in small nocturnal mammals when they first wake up in the evening.

Although homeothermy lends advantages such as increased activity levels, small mammals and birds maintaining an internal body temperature spend up to 100 times more energy in low ambient temperatures compared to ectotherms. To cope with this challenge, these animals maintain a much lower body temperature, staying just over ambient temperature rather than at normal operating temperature. This reduction in body temperature and metabolic rate allows the prolonged survival of animals capable of entering torpid states.

In 2020, scientists reported evidence of the torpor in &quot;Lystrosaurus&quot; living ~250 Mya in Antarctica – the oldest evidence of a hibernation-like state in a vertebrate animal.

== Functions ==
Slowing metabolic rate to conserve energy in times of insufficient resources is the primarily noted purpose of torpor. This conclusion is largely based on laboratory studies where torpor was observed to follow food deprivation. There is evidence for other adaptive functions of torpor where animals are observed in natural contexts:

=== Circadian rhythm during torpor ===
Animals that can enter torpor rely on biological rhythms such as circadian and circannual rhythms to continue natural functions. Different animals will manage their circadian rhythm differently, and in some species it&#x27;s seen to completely stop (such as in European hamsters). Other organisms, such as a black bear, enter torpor and switch to multi-day cycles rather than rely on a circadian rhythm. However, it is seen that both captive and wild bears express similar circadian rhythms when entering torpor. Bears entering torpor in a simulated den with no light expressed normal but low functioning rhythms. The same was observed in wild bears denning in natural areas. The function of circadian rhythms in black, brown, and polar bears suggest that their system of torpor is evolutionarily advanced.

===Energy conservation in small birds ===
Torpor has been shown to be a strategy of small migrant birds to preserve their body energy stores. Hummingbirds, resting at night during migration, were observed to enter torpor which helped to conserve fat stores during migration or cold nights at high altitude.

This strategy of using torpor to preserve energy stores, such as fat, has also been observed in wintering chickadees. Black-capped chickadees, living in temperate forests of North America, do not migrate south during winter. The chickadee can maintain a body temperature 12 °C lower than normal. This reduction in metabolism allows it to conserve 30% of fat stores amassed from the previous day.

=== Advantage in environments with unpredictable food sources ===

Torpor can be a strategy of animals with unpredictable food supplies. For example, high-latitude living rodents use torpor seasonally when not reproducing. These rodents use torpor as means to survive winter and live to reproduce in the next reproduction cycle when food sources are plentiful, separating periods of torpor from the reproduction period. The eastern long-eared bat uses torpor during winter and is able to arouse and forage during warm periods. Some animals use torpor during their reproductive cycle, as seen in unpredictable habitats. They experience the cost of a prolonged reproduction period but the payoff is survival to be able to reproduce at all.

=== Survival during mass extinctions ===

It is suggested that this daily torpor use may have allowed survival through mass extinction events. Heterotherms make up only four out of 61 mammals confirmed to have gone extinct over the last 500 years. Torpor enables animals to reduce energy requirements allowing them to better survive harsh conditions.

=== Inter-species competition ===

Interspecific competition occurs when two species require the same resource for energy production. Torpor increases fitness in the case of inter-specific competition with the nocturnal common spiny mouse. When the golden spiny mouse experiences reduced food availability by diet overlap with the common spiny mouse it spends more time in a torpid state.

=== Parasite resistance by bats ===

A drop in temperature from torpor has been shown to reduce the ability of parasites to reproduce. In temperate zones, the reproductive rates of ectoparasites on bats decrease when the bats enter torpor. In regions where bats don&#x27;t undergo torpor, the parasites maintain a consistent reproductive rate throughout the year.

== NASA deep sleep option for a mission to Mars ==
In 2013, SpaceWorks Engineering began researching a way to dramatically cut the cost of a human expedition to Mars by putting the crew in extended torpor for 90 to 180 days. Traveling while hibernating would reduce astronauts&#x27; metabolic functions and minimize requirements for life support during multi-year missions.

<text>The Syrian Air Force () is the air force branch of the Syrian Armed Forces. It was established in 1948, and first saw action in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Under Ba&#x27;athist Syria until 2024 it was known as the Syrian Arab Air Force. Land-based air defense systems were grouped under the Syrian Air Defence Force, which split from both the Air Force and the Army. 

As of February 2025, the air force status is unknown, with some of its equipment being lost following the Hay&#x27;at Tahrir al-Sham and other rebel groups offensive in November 2024 and subsequent Israeli Air Force&#x27;s airstrikes in December 2024, following the collapse of the Assad regime.

==History==
===1940s===

The end of World War II led to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom and France from the Middle East, and this included a withdrawal from Syria. In 1948, the Syrian Air Force was officially established after the first class of pilots graduated from a French-run flight school at Estabel airfield in Lebanon, using aircraft left behind by the French. Further training of early Syrian military fliers was continued with help of a sizeable group of Croat and German instructors, contracted by the Lebanese and Syrian governments from refugee camps in Italy. Among the foreign instructors were Mato Dukovac (a leading Croatian Air Force fighter ace of World War II) and Fritz Strehle (former Me.262 pilot with Jagdgeschwader 7 of the Luftwaffe), who trained Syrian pilots at Estabel in 1948 and at Nayrab airfield (south of Aleppo) in 1949.

Organized into three squadrons, one of which was equipped with North American T-6 Harvards, the air force participated in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, conducting bombing raids against Israeli forces and settlements. One T-6 was lost to ground fire while attacking Ayelet Hashahar on 16 July, and another possibly shot down by Morris Mann (flying an Avia S-199) on 10 June. The Syrian Air Force claimed its sole kill of the war on 10 July when a rear gunner of a Harvard shot down an Avia S-199 flown by Lionel Bloch.

===1950s===

During and immediately after this war, successive governments sought to bolster the air force through the acquisition of Fiat G.55s, Fiat G.59B-2s, and Fiat G.46-1s from Italy. In January 1950, a set of contracts was signed with London, providing for training of Syrian officers and pilots, along with the acquisition of de Havilland Chipmunk basic trainers, Supermarine Spitfire Mk 22s, and Gloster Meteor F.Mk 8 and T.Mk 7 jets from Great Britain. While the Chipmunks and Spitfires arrived without problems and entered service with the Flight School at Nayrab, the delivery of Meteors was held up by a temporary British arms embargo.

The original batch of Meteors manufactured for Syria was sold to France instead. It was only following additional negotiations that SyAF received its first jet aircraft, in the form of two Meteor F.Mk 8s. All 12 were in Syria by 9 March 1953. Another batch of seven refurbished ex-RAF F.Mk 8s and two FR.Mk 9 reconnaissance fighters followed in 1956. In summer 1954, six ex-RAF Meteor NF.Mk 13 were delivered without their radar equipment: in Syria, they were used for training purposes until 1958. Because the government of Great Britain imposed additional arms embargoes, most of pilots for Meteors had to be trained in Egypt.

In 1955, Syria placed its first order for 24 MiG-15bis fighters and 4 MiG-15UTI two-seat conversion trainers from Czechoslovakia (&#x27;Operation 104&#x27;). Another batch of 24 MiG-15s was ordered in early 1956. All these aircraft were delivered to Egypt, by October 1956, but their pilots and ground crews were still undergoing training when Israel, followed by France and Great Britain, invaded Egypt in the course of the Suez Crisis of 1956. Three MiG-15UTIs were evacuated to Syria via Saudi Arabia and Jordan; 20 MiG-15bis and 1 MiG-15UTI were destroyed in British attacks on Abu Suweir Air Base. The second batch of 20 MiG-15bis&#x27; was not yet assembled: the aircraft in question were all damaged by British air strikes, but subsequently repaired and donated to Egypt. On 6 November 1956, Meteors from No. 9 Squadron Syrian Air Force had shot down a Royal Air Force Canberra PR.7 that was involved in reconnaissance of Syria and Iraq. The aircraft crashed on the border to Lebanon: one crewmember was killed, while two were captured alive.

Sixty MiG-17s - including 20 radar-equipped MiG-17PFs - were ordered at the end of 1956 and Syrian pilots were dispatched to the USSR and Poland for training. The first aircraft arrived in January 1957 and by the end of the year, two MiG-17 squadrons were defending the capital from their base at Damasucus&#x27; Mezzeh Military Airport. By the end of the year, additional orders were placed in the USSR for 12 Ilyushin Il-28 bombers.

In February 1958 Syria and Egypt joined to create the United Arab Republic. The Syrian Air Force was integrated into the United Arab Republic Air Force (UARAF) and ceased to exist. Nearly all of its aircraft and personnel, all of training aids and most of the equipment were re-deployed to Egypt, and replaced by two squadrons of MiG-17Fs of the UARAF. For example, recently delivered MiG-17PFs and their pilots formed the No. 31 &#x27;Crow-Bat&#x27; Squadron of the UARAF. During the times of the United Arab Republic, this unit was always commanded by a Syrian officer.

===1960s===

The union ended following the 1961 Syrian coup d&#x27;état. The new military flying service - officially designated the Syrian Arab Air Force (SyAAF) - was re-established later the same year, using aircraft left behind by the Egyptians, including about 40 MiG-17Fs and 4 Il-28s.

The new government of the Syrian Arab Republic attempted to buy additional aircraft in Germany and Italy, in 1961 and 1962. When all related efforts failed, Syria was left without a choice but to turn to Czechoslovakia for arms. By the time, Czechoslovakia was out of the business of producing fighters and interceptors, and thus the Syrians had to buy from Soviet Union instead. On 19 June 1962, Damascus and Moscow signed a major contract for arms, including an order for 34 MiG-21F-13 interceptors and 4 MiG-21U conversion trainers.

Delivered starting in spring 1963, MiG-21s entered service with two squadrons of the 3rd Air Brigade, based at Dmeyr Air Base, 40 km (25 miles) northeast of Damascus. MiG-17s were meanwhile operated by two squadrons of the 7th Air Brigade, based at Almezzeh Air Base, in Damascus.

With the ascent to power of the Baath Party, during the 1963 Syrian coup d&#x27;état, Hafez al-Assad (former Meteor- and MiG-17PF-pilot), was appointed the Commander of SyAAF. Preoccupied with his involvement in domestic politics, Assad left the effective command of the SyAAF to his Deputy, Brigadier-General Mohammad Assad Moukiiad (former Meteor-pilot trained in Great Britain).

During the Six-Day War, the SyAAF flew few air strikes on targets in northern Israel on the first day of the conflict but was subsequently evacuated to air bases in remote parts of Syria. In this fashion it evaded most of Israeli air strikes that caused massive damage to Egyptian and Jordanian air bases. This, in turn, helped the IDF in defeating the Syrian Army on the ground and led to the occupation of the Golan Heights. After this conflict, Syria continued acquiring small numbers of MiG-17s from East Germany and MiG-21s from the Soviet Union.

===1970s===
In May 1973, a new arms deal was signed with the Soviet Union, resulting in deliveries of over 100 additional MiG-21M/MFs by the end of the year. The Yom Kippur War provided initial success for both Syria and Egypt, but the SyAAF suffered extensive losses in air combats, prompting the Soviets to launch an air-bridge to Aleppo and Damascus, starting on 9 October 1973. Replacement aircraft initially included only MiG-17s and MiG-21s: in April 1974, Syria received the first two batches of MiG-23 fighter-bombers. Acquisition of additional aircraft from the USSR was stopped in 1975 due to differences of political nature between Damascus and Moscow.
In the late 1970s, an insurgency characterised by dozens of assassinations of government officials and military officers erupted in Syria. By 1978, the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria joined the armed uprising. Concerned by destabilisation of the government of President Hafez al-Assad, Moscow decided to restart providing arms and military aid. In April of the same year, a new arms deal was signed, including deliveries of advanced MiG-23MF and MiG-25 interceptors, and additional MiG-23BN and Su-22 fighter-bombers, and deployment of up to 4000 of Soviet advisors. However, the insurgency continued to spread and included attacks on Soviet advisors.

===1980s===
In 1981, the commander of the SyAAF, Major-General Mamdouh Hamdi Abaza, was assassinated by the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria. In early 1982, hundreds of SyAAF officers became involved in a coup attempt against President Hafez al-Assad, originally planned to take place in coordination with an armed uprising in the city of Hama. The government bloodily crushed the uprising in Hama, and subsequently purged the SyAAF.

The Syrian Arab Air Force thus entered the 1982 Lebanon War in significantly weakened condition and suffered massive losses in a series of aerial combats between 6 and 11 June 1982. Israel claimed the destruction of 85 Syrian MiGs (including MiG-21s as well as MiG-23s). No evidence was ever provided for Soviet and Russian claims that the SyAAF had shot down up to 60 Israeli aircraft in return. Nevertheless, unofficial Russian, and a few unofficial Syrian sources continue to claim a modicum of success against Israeli aircraft in this conflict. At low altitude the Syrian Air Force effectively used Aerospatiale Gazelle helicopters in the anti-armour role against advancing Israeli ground forces. In one such engagement, an Israeli tank column was stopped for some hours by SAF Gazelle missile strikes while approaching Ein Zehalta.

Immediately after the 1982 Lebanon War, the USSR continued to refuse deliveries of more advanced aircraft. It was only in August 1982, that Moscow changed its mind and granted permission for delivery of MiG-23ML interceptors, followed by advanced Su-22M-4 fighter-bombers. In an attempt to help Syria establish a strategic balance with Israel, in 1986 the Syrians were granted permission to place orders for 24 MiG-29s and 24 Su-24s. Deliveries of these commenced in 1987, but were still incomplete by the time the Soviet Union officially ceased providing military aid to Syria, in 1989.

===1990s/2000s===

Short on spares and lacking funding for fuel and maintenance, the SyAAF was largely grounded for most of the 1990s and 2000s. Reports regarding purchases of Su-27s in 2000–2001, MiG-29SMTs, MiG-31s, and Yak-130s from the period 2006–2008, have all proven to be unfounded. The only reinforcement the air force acquired during this period came in form of 28 MiG-23MLDs and 5 MiG-23UBs acquired from Belarus in 2008. In 2008, Syria has agreed to purchase 36 aircraft, but delivery of these has been postponed by Russia due to the conflict in Syria. In May 2014 Russia announced that it would supply Syria with Yakovlev Yak-130s. Syria was expected to receive nine aircraft by the end of 2014, 12 in 2015 and 15 in 2016, for a total of 36 airplanes. However, as of 2022, no deliveries had taken place.

===2010s===
In July 2012 at the Farnborough Air Show it was announced that Russia would not deliver any new aircraft including the MiG-29M/M2s and Yak-130s while there was still a crisis in Syria, but it would still respect any previous refurbishment and maintenance contracts such as the MiG-25s.

=== 2024 ===
Following the Syrian Civil War and Hay&#x27;at Tahrir al-Sham bringing Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s regime to an end, the Israeli Air Force executed strikes nearly destroying the entire air force between 8 and 10 December 2024, to prevent strategic assets falling into the hands of terrorist groups.

==Operations during the Syrian civil war==

During the initial phase of the Syrian civil war, up to mid-2012, the Syrian Air Force was involved in secondary roles, with no firing from aircraft and helicopters.

The situation changed on 22 March 2012, with an escalation in the use of airpower by Government forces, starting with armed Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopter gunships firing rockets and machine guns.
The air war escalated further in mid June 2012, with the use of Mi-24/25 attack helicopters capable of dropping standard aviation bombs weighing up to 250 kg, while the transport helicopters started dropping barrel bombs, aerial IEDs.

On 24 July 2012, attack sorties by fixed-wing aircraft were reported by the rebels and recorded on video: initially L-39 COIN armed trainers began using rockets, bombs and guns but they were quickly joined by MiG-21s and MiG-23s. A few weeks later Su-22 ground attack aircraft were used and in November 2012, Su-24 medium bombers were filmed bombing rebels.
In December 2012, conventionally armed Scud missiles and other similar ballistic missiles were fired against rebel positions.

Following a report on the appearance of newly delivered S-8 air-to-ground rocket pods previously not operated by the Syrian Air Force, being employed on different aircraft, on 22 October 2013, a S-8 armed MiG-29 was spotted and recorded on video while flying over Damascus, suggesting that the type was pushed into action for ground attack, possibly after the pilots attended specific training on the type. Subsequently, MiG-29&#x27;s were recorded performing rocket and gun attack runs on rebel positions.

The first reported activity of Syrian MiG-25 aircraft in the civil war was recorded on 8 February 2014, when two Turkish Air Force F-16s were scrambled to intercept a Syrian MiG-25 which was approaching the Turkish border. On 27 March 2014, a MiG-25 was clearly filmed while flying at medium altitude over Hama Eastern countryside, possibly delivering the bomb seen hitting the ground in the same video. Until February 2014, Syrian MiG-25s were not seen, perhaps due to the type of war, different from the role of the MiG-25 and possibly due to initial technical difficulties in keeping the MiG-25 fleet operational. The use of the MiG-25 in the Syrian Civil War marks the starting point since when all the known types of Syrian combat aircraft and ballistic missiles came into use.

With the start of aerial operations by the Syrian Air Force, in August 2012, online publications probably overestimating rebels&#x27; claims on the number of destroyed aircraft, assumed that the Syrian Air Force was suffering significant technical difficulties, resulting in less than half of the best SAAF ground attack aircraft such as the Mi-25 Hind-D being serviceable. The publications reported that an increased number of conflict fronts and severe maintenance burdens dramatically worsened the situation, which was reportedly difficult before the war. These problems were thought to account for the use of L-39ZA (attack variant) jets, before further escalations. Operational limitations were overcome during 2013 as Syrian pilots and technicians with the assistance of foreign advisers and technicians began to improve their operational skills. In December 2013 Jane&#x27;s reported that the Syrian Air Force had dramatically improved its operational capabilities during 2013, and was now frequently conducting up to 100 sorties per day with half of these constituting combat sorties.

Insurgents counter the Syrian Air Force with truck mounted, medium and heavy machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, small arms fire and starting in late 2012, MANPADS up to modern Russian and Chinese designs.

As the Syrian Air Force became more involved, the insurgents obtained more anti-aircraft equipment, captured air defense sites and warehouses while receiving shipments of Chinese and Russian material from external sponsors. An improvement in accuracy was achieved and several Syrian Air Force jets and helicopters were shot down from August 2012. Since insurgents besieged many airports, many of the aircraft were shot down taking off or landing. The raiding and shelling of airbases led to aircraft and helicopters being damaged or destroyed on the ground.

In spite of occasional losses the Syrian Air Force remained largely unchallenged, efficient and feared by the rebels until it&#x27;s collapse. Compared to Western air forces fighting against similarly armed enemies in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, the main disadvantage of the Syrian Air Force was the lack of precision guided weapons which allow the aircraft to stay out of range of small arms fire, AAA and MANPADS, while bombing accurately. The same weakness prevents them from hitting targets of opportunity in the same mission. In 2014, Jane&#x27;s Defence and Combat Aircraft Monthly report some MiG-29s and possibly some Su-24s capable of launching precision guided munitions.

Syrian pilots spend most of their flying time at low to medium altitude where battlefield threats are more potent.
Based on the aircraft type, Syrian pilots use different attack techniques for unguided munitions. L-39s attack in a dive, fast jets usually attacked in a low to medium altitude bombing run at high speed, firing thermal decoy flares against IR homing missiles and zooming after the attack. Later, fast jets added rocket and gun diving attacks. Helicopters were seen flying at unusually high altitudes which minimized their accuracy and increased collateral damage, but reduced losses since they did not have the high speed and acceleration of jet fighters; the altitude putting them out of range of most of the ground threats. Mi-24/25 gunships were observed delivering decoy flares as well.

The Syrian Air Force frequently attacks insurgent forces with helicopter gunships in populated areas with unguided weaponry and the bombings often cause collateral damage to the civilian population and infrastructure.
From the end of 2012 until December 2014, Syrian Air Force L-39 were seldom seen, one of the two airbases for L-39 was captured and the other was besieged. In December 2014, videos surfaced showing the aircraft coming back to operational status after a factory overhaul inside Syria.

At the beginning of August 2015, a summary of the recent Syrian Air Force activity reported that during July 2015, the Syrian Air Force performed 6,673 air attacks, the highest number since the beginning of the war. It was reported that between October 2014 and July 2015, at least 26,517 attacks were made. This showed that aircraft losses had been overestimated, while the airframe overhauling and rotation increased the overall combat readiness of the Syrian Air Force since Syria could not count on replacements, apart from some refurbished ex-Iraqi Su-22s, delivered from Iran in the Spring of 2015, which had been flown there during the Gulf War in 1991. In early 2015, it was rumored that Russian pilots were flying operations for the Syrian Air Force.

On 18 June 2017, US military officials confirmed that a U.S. F/A-18E Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Sukhoi Su-22 after the warplane dropped bombs near SDF fighters south of Tabqa. Following the Syrian civil war and the end of Bashar Al-Assad regime, the Israeli Air Force executed several air stikes on Syrian air force bases resulting in a near-total destruction of the Syrian Air Force.

==Organization==

As of 2017, the Syrian Arab Air force consisted of following units:
*20th Air Division, with 3 fighter-bomber brigades, 3 helicopter brigades, and 1 transport brigade (southern Syria)
*22nd Air Division, with 4 fighter-bomber brigades, 1 helicopter brigade, and Air Force College (central and north-western Syria)

These included following units: 
*17 Interceptor and fighter-bomber squadrons (each with 1-5 operational aircraft)
*8 helicopter squadrons (each with 2-8 operational helicopters)
*1 VIP transport group
*1 training group

===Air bases===

Syrian insurgents overran several air bases in north-western, northern and southern Syria, including Marj al-Sultan and Taftanaz Air Base (mid-January 2013), Dhab&#x27;a Air Base (better known as al-Qussayr, in April 2013), and Kshesh Air Base (October 2013).

Forces of The Islamic State captured Tabqa Air Base on 24 August 2014.

==Pre-Syrian civil war aircraft inventory==
Due to the high security level on everything military related in the Syrian regime, the past of the Syrian Arab Air Force is still largely unknown. This makes it hard to judge what was the real strength of the air force. Additionally, considerable losses to the opposition forces in the country&#x27;s ongoing civil war are not accounted for here. The following information is compiled from multiple, pre-2012 Syrian civil war sources.

According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 2011 the aircraft inventory from Syrian Arab Air Force estimations was:
* 575 Fixed-wing aircraft:
** Combat/Reconnaissance/OCU aircraft: 461
** Training aircraft: 76
** Transport aircraft: 26
* 191 Rotary-wing aircraft:
** Attack helicopters: 71
** Armed transport/utility helicopters: 120

==Aircraft==
===Former inventory===
Current status of the Syrian Air Force is uncertain following the Hay&#x27;at Tahrir al-Sham and other insurgent groups November 2024 offensive and the Israeli Air Force airstrikes between the 8th and 10th December 2024. The rebels also reportedly seized a non-operational Ilyushin Il-28 bomber kept in storage after the capture of Hama.

=== Armament ===
=== Retired ===
Previous aircraft operated were the Gloster Meteor, Supermarine Spitfire, de Havilland DH.100 Vampire, Sukhoi Su-7, MiG-15, MiG-17, MiG-19, Ilyushin Il-28, Antonov An-2, Douglas C-47, Junkers Ju 52, T-6 Texan, Fiat G.46, Fiat G.55, Beriev Be-12, Aero L-29 Delfin, Yakovlev Yak-18, Tupolev Tu-143, MBB 223 Flamingo, Mil Mi-1, Mil Mi-6, and Mil Mi-4.

=== Lost during Syrian Civil War ===

During the ongoing Syrian Civil War, the Syrian Air force suffered numerous losses of fixed, and rotary aircraft in the opening years. However, with Russian and Iranian support, combat readiness of the Syrian Arab Air Force assets had significantly increased during the later years of the conflict.

The roundel used by the Syrian Arab Air Force has the same generic design as that used by the Egyptian Air Force. It consists of three concentric circles, with a red outer part, white middle and black inner part. The unique part of the Syrian roundel is the presence of two green stars in the white circle, which is reflective of the two stars on the national flag. The fin flash is also an image of the flag.

<text>The bunny hop is a novelty dance created at Balboa High School in San Francisco in 1952.

==History==
The dance has been generally done to Ray Anthony&#x27;s big band recording of the song with this name. It was a vocal hit in 1952, and instrumentally re-recorded 1958. The song has been re-recorded by others, including musical updates of the style, for example, a salsa version. Duke Ellington recorded &quot;Bunny Hop Mambo&quot; in 1954. Other popular music of the era is also used, such as &quot;The Glow-Worm&quot;.

In 1979, several men were arrested for public lewdness during the Village Station police raid for dancing in a bunny hop.

Ray Anthony&#x27;s single release of the &quot;Bunny Hop&quot; featured another novelty dance classic, the &quot;Hokey Pokey&quot; on the B side.

==Description==
The dance is a variation on a conga line. Participants dance in a line or a circle, holding on to the hips of the person in front of them. They tap the floor two times with their left foot, then with their right foot, then they hop forwards, backwards, and finally three hops forward to finish the sequence, which continues throughout the tune. The first person in the line or the open circle leads the group around the floor.

==Variations==
The &quot;letkajenkka&quot; from Finland has essentially the same steps. 

In 2014 in Saudi Arabia, the same dance set to slightly different music (referred to as &quot;raqsat al-batriq&quot;, the &quot;penguin dance&quot;) became a popular trend on online video-sharing sites and a staple at wedding dance parties.

==In popular culture==
*Allan Sherman listed the bunny hop as &quot;a very nice dance&quot; at the coda of his parody &quot;Crazy Downtown&quot;, along with older dances such as the tango and waltz (as opposed to modern dances such as the Frug).

<text>A mantle plume is a proposed mechanism of convection within the Earth&#x27;s mantle, hypothesized to explain anomalous volcanism. Because the plume head partially melts on reaching shallow depths, a plume is often invoked as the cause of volcanic hotspots, such as Hawaii or Iceland, and large igneous provinces such as the Deccan and Siberian Traps. Some such volcanic regions lie far from tectonic plate boundaries, while others represent unusually large-volume volcanism near plate boundaries.

==Concepts==
Mantle plumes were first proposed by J. Tuzo Wilson in 1963 and further developed by W. Jason Morgan in 1971 and 1972. A mantle plume is posited to exist where super-heated material forms (nucleates) at the core-mantle boundary and rises through the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Rather than a continuous stream, plumes should be viewed as a series of hot bubbles of material. Reaching the brittle upper Earth&#x27;s crust they form diapirs. These diapirs are &quot;hotspots&quot; in the crust. In particular, the concept that mantle plumes are fixed relative to one another and anchored at the core-mantle boundary would provide a natural explanation for the time-progressive chains of older volcanoes seen extending out from some such hotspots, for example, the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. However, paleomagnetic data show that mantle plumes can also be associated with Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) and do move relative to each other.

The current mantle plume theory is that material and energy from Earth&#x27;s interior are exchanged with the surface crust in two distinct and largely independent convective flows:

* as previously theorized and widely accepted, the predominant, steady state plate tectonic regime driven by upper mantle convection, mainly the sinking of cold plates of lithosphere back into the asthenosphere. 
* the punctuated, intermittently dominant mantle overturn regime driven by plume convection that carries heat upward from the core-mantle boundary in a narrow column. This second regime, while often discontinuous, is periodically significant in mountain building and continental breakup.

The plume hypothesis was simulated by laboratory experiments in small fluid-filled tanks in the early 1970s. Thermal or compositional fluid-dynamical plumes produced in that way were presented as models for the much larger postulated mantle plumes. Based on these experiments, mantle plumes are now postulated to comprise two parts: a long thin conduit connecting the top of the plume to its base, and a bulbous head that expands in size as the plume rises. The entire structure resembles a mushroom. The bulbous head of thermal plumes forms because hot material moves upward through the conduit faster than the plume itself rises through its surroundings. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, experiments with thermal models showed that as the bulbous head expands it may entrain some of the adjacent mantle into itself.

The size and occurrence of mushroom mantle plumes can be predicted by the transient instability theory of Tan and Thorpe. The theory predicts mushroom-shaped mantle plumes with heads of about 2000 km diameter that have a critical time (time from onset of heating of the lower mantle to formation of a plume) of about 830 million years for a core mantle heat flux of 20 mW/m2, while the cycle time (the time between plume formation events) is about 2000 million years. The number of mantle plumes is predicted to be about 17.

When a plume head encounters the base of the lithosphere, it is expected to flatten out against this barrier and to undergo widespread decompression melting to form large volumes of basalt magma. It may then erupt onto the surface. Numerical modelling predicts that melting and eruption will take place over several million years. These eruptions have been linked to flood basalts, although many of those erupt over much shorter time scales (less than 1 million years). Examples include the Deccan traps in India, the Siberian traps of Asia, the Karoo-Ferrar basalts/dolerites in South Africa and Antarctica, the Paraná and Etendeka traps in South America and Africa (formerly a single province separated by opening of the South Atlantic Ocean), and the Columbia River basalts of North America. Flood basalts in the oceans are known as oceanic plateaus, and include the Ontong Java plateau of the western Pacific Ocean and the Kerguelen Plateau of the Indian Ocean.

The narrow vertical conduit, postulated to connect the plume head to the core-mantle boundary, is viewed as providing a continuous supply of magma to a hotspot. As the overlying tectonic plate moves over this hotspot, the eruption of magma from the fixed plume onto the surface is expected to form a chain of volcanoes that parallels plate motion. The Hawaiian Islands chain in the Pacific Ocean is the archetypal example. It has recently been discovered that the volcanic locus of this chain has not been fixed over time, and it thus joined the club of the many type examples that do not exhibit the key characteristic originally proposed.

The eruption of continental flood basalts is often associated with continental rifting and breakup. This has led to the hypothesis that mantle plumes contribute to continental rifting and the formation of ocean basins.

===Chemistry, heat flow and melting===

The chemical and isotopic composition of basalts found at hotspots differs subtly from mid-ocean-ridge basalts. These basalts, also called ocean island basalts (OIBs), are analysed in their radiogenic and stable isotope compositions. In radiogenic isotope systems the originally subducted material creates diverging trends, termed mantle components. Identified mantle components are DMM (depleted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle), HIMU (high U/Pb-ratio mantle), EM1 (enriched mantle 1), EM2 (enriched mantle 2) and FOZO (focus zone). This geochemical signature arises from the mixing of near-surface materials such as subducted slabs and continental sediments, in the mantle source. There are two competing interpretations for this. In the context of mantle plumes, the near-surface material is postulated to have been transported down to the core-mantle boundary by subducting slabs, and to have been transported back up to the surface by plumes. In the context of the Plate hypothesis, subducted material is mostly re-circulated in the shallow mantle and tapped from there by volcanoes.

Stable isotopes like Fe are used to track processes that the uprising material experiences during melting.

The processing of oceanic crust, lithosphere, and sediment through a subduction zone decouples the water-soluble trace elements (e.g., K, Rb, Th) from the immobile trace elements (e.g., Ti, Nb, Ta), concentrating the immobile elements in the oceanic slab (the water-soluble elements are added to the crust in island arc volcanoes). Seismic tomography shows that subducted oceanic slabs sink as far as the bottom of the mantle transition zone at 650 km depth. Subduction to greater depths is less certain, but there is evidence that they may sink to mid-lower-mantle depths at about 1,500  km depth.

The source of mantle plumes is postulated to be the core-mantle boundary at 3,000  km depth. Because there is little material transport across the core-mantle boundary, heat transfer must occur by conduction, with adiabatic gradients above and below this boundary. The core-mantle boundary is a strong thermal (temperature) discontinuity. The temperature of the core is approximately 1,000 degrees Celsius higher than that of the overlying mantle. Plumes are postulated to rise as the base of the mantle becomes hotter and more buoyant.

Plumes are postulated to rise through the mantle and begin to partially melt on reaching shallow depths in the asthenosphere by decompression melting. This would create large volumes of magma. This melt rises to the surface and erupts to form hotspots.

==The lower mantle and the core==
The most prominent thermal contrast known to exist in the deep (1000 km) mantle is at the core-mantle boundary at 2900 km. Mantle plumes were originally postulated to rise from this layer because the hotspots that are assumed to be their surface expression were thought to be fixed relative to one another. This required that plumes were sourced from beneath the shallow asthenosphere that is thought to be flowing rapidly in response to motion of the overlying tectonic plates. There is no other known major thermal boundary layer in the deep Earth, and so the core-mantle boundary was the only candidate.

The base of the mantle is known as the D″ layer, a seismological subdivision of the Earth. It appears to be compositionally distinct from the overlying mantle and may contain partial melt.

Two very broad, large low-shear-velocity provinces exist in the lower mantle under Africa and under the central Pacific. It is postulated that plumes rise from their surface or their edges. Their low seismic velocities were thought to suggest that they are relatively hot, although it has recently been shown that their low wave velocities are due to high density caused by chemical heterogeneity.

==Evidence for the theory==
Some common and basic lines of evidence cited in support of the theory are linear volcanic chains, noble gases, geophysical anomalies, and geochemistry.

===Linear volcanic chains===
The age-progressive distribution of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain has been explained as a result of a fixed, deep-mantle plume rising into the upper mantle, partly melting, and causing a volcanic chain to form as the plate moves overhead relative to the fixed plume source. Other hotspots with time-progressive volcanic chains behind them include Réunion, the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge, the Louisville Ridge, the Ninety East Ridge and Kerguelen, Tristan, and Yellowstone.

While there is evidence that the chains listed above are time-progressive, it has been shown that they are not fixed relative to one another. The most remarkable example of this is the Emperor chain, the older part of the Hawaii system, which was formed by migration of the hotspot in addition to the plate motion. Another example is the Canary Islands in the northeast of Africa in the Atlantic Ocean.

===Noble gas and other isotopes===

Helium-3 is a primordial isotope that formed in the Big Bang. Very little is produced, and little has been added to the Earth by other processes since then. Helium-4 includes a primordial component, but it is also produced by the natural radioactive decay of elements such as uranium and thorium. Over time, helium in the upper atmosphere is lost into space. Thus, the Earth has become progressively depleted in helium, and 3He is not replaced as 4He is. As a result, the ratio 3He/4He in the Earth has decreased over time.

Unusually high 3He/4He have been observed in some, but not all, hotspots. This is explained by plumes tapping a deep, primordial reservoir in the lower mantle, where the original, high 3He/4He ratios have been preserved throughout geologic time.

Other elements, e.g. osmium, have been suggested to be tracers of material arising from near to the Earth&#x27;s core, in basalts at oceanic islands. However, so far conclusive proof for this is lacking.

===Geophysical anomalies===
The plume hypothesis has been tested by looking for the geophysical anomalies predicted to be associated with them. These include thermal, seismic, and elevation anomalies. Thermal anomalies are inherent in the term &quot;hotspot&quot;. They can be measured in numerous different ways, including surface heat flow, petrology, and seismology. Thermal anomalies produce anomalies in the speeds of seismic waves, but unfortunately so do composition and partial melt. As a result, wave speeds cannot be used simply and directly to measure temperature, but more sophisticated approaches must be taken.

Seismic anomalies are identified by mapping variations in wave speed as seismic waves travel through Earth. A hot mantle plume is predicted to have lower seismic wave speeds compared with similar material at a lower temperature. Mantle material containing a trace of partial melt (e.g., as a result of it having a lower melting point), or being richer in Fe, also has a lower seismic wave speed and those effects are stronger than temperature. Thus, although unusually low wave speeds have been taken to indicate anomalously hot mantle beneath hotspots, this interpretation is ambiguous. The most commonly cited seismic wave-speed images that are used to look for variations in regions where plumes have been proposed come from seismic tomography. This method involves using a network of seismometers to construct three-dimensional images of the variation in seismic wave speed throughout the mantle.

Seismic waves generated by large earthquakes enable structure below the Earth&#x27;s surface to be determined along the ray path. Seismic waves that have traveled a thousand or more kilometers (also called teleseismic waves) can be used to image large regions of Earth&#x27;s mantle. They also have limited resolution, however, and only structures at least several hundred kilometers in diameter can be detected.

Seismic tomography images have been cited as evidence for a number of mantle plumes in Earth&#x27;s mantle. There is, however, vigorous on-going discussion regarding whether the structures imaged are reliably resolved, and whether they correspond to columns of hot, rising rock.

The mantle plume hypothesis predicts that domal topographic uplifts will develop when plume heads impinge on the base of the lithosphere. An uplift of this kind occurred when the North Atlantic Ocean opened about 54 million years ago. Some scientists have linked this to a mantle plume postulated to have caused the breakup of Eurasia and the opening of the North Atlantic, now suggested to underlie Iceland. Current research has shown that the time-history of the uplift is probably much shorter than predicted, however. It is thus not clear how strongly this observation supports the mantle plume hypothesis.

===Geochemistry===
Basalts found at oceanic islands are geochemically distinct from mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB). Ocean island basalt (OIB) is more diverse compositionally than MORB, and the great majority of ocean islands are composed of alkali basalt enriched in sodium and potassium relative to MORB. Larger islands, such as Hawaii or Iceland, are mostly tholeiitic basalt, with alkali basalt limited to late stages of their development, but this tholeiitic basalt is chemically distinct from the tholeiitic basalt of mid-ocean ridges. OIB tends to be more enriched in magnesium, and both alkali and tholeiitic OIB is enriched in trace incompatible elements, with the light rare earth elements showing particular enrichment compared with heavier rare earth elements. Stable isotope ratios of the elements strontium, neodymium, hafnium, lead, and osmium show wide variations relative to MORB, which is attributed to the mixing of at least three mantle components: HIMU with a high proportion of radiogenic lead, produced by decay of uranium and other heavy radioactive elements; EM1 with less enrichment of radiogenic lead; and EM2 with a high 87Sr/86Sr ratio. Helium in OIB shows a wider variation in the 3He/4He ratio than MORB, with some values approaching the primordial value.

The composition of ocean island basalts is attributed to the presence of distinct mantle chemical reservoirs formed by subduction of oceanic crust. These include reservoirs corresponding to HUIMU, EM1, and EM2. These reservoirs are thought to have different major element compositions, based on the correlation between major element compositions of OIB and their stable isotope ratios. Tholeiitic OIB is interpreted as a product of a higher degree of partial melting in particularly hot plumes, while alkali OIB is interpreted as a product of a lower degree of partial melting in smaller, cooler plumes.

===Seismology===
In 2015, based on data from 273 large earthquakes, researchers compiled a model based on full waveform tomography, requiring the equivalent of 3 million hours of supercomputer time. Due to computational limitations, high-frequency data still could not be used, and seismic data remained unavailable from much of the seafloor. Nonetheless, vertical plumes, 400 C hotter than the surrounding rock, were visualized under many hotspots, including the Pitcairn, Macdonald, Samoa, Tahiti, Marquesas, Galapagos, Cape Verde, and Canary hotspots. They extended nearly vertically from the core-mantle boundary (2900 km depth) to a possible layer of shearing and bending at 1000 km. They were detectable because they were 600–800 km wide, more than three times the width expected from contemporary models. Many of these plumes are in the large low-shear-velocity provinces under Africa and the Pacific, while some other hotspots such as Yellowstone were less clearly related to mantle features in the model.

The unexpected size of the plumes leaves open the possibility that they may conduct the bulk of the Earth&#x27;s 44 terawatts of internal heat flow from the core to the surface, and means that the lower mantle convects less than expected, if at all. It is possible that there is a compositional difference between plumes and the surrounding mantle that slows them down and broadens them.

==Suggested mantle plume locations==

Mantle plumes have been suggested as the source for flood basalts. These extremely rapid, large scale eruptions of basaltic magmas have periodically formed continental flood basalt provinces on land and oceanic plateaus in the ocean basins, such as the Deccan Traps, the Siberian Traps the Karoo-Ferrar flood basalts of Gondwana, and the largest known continental flood basalt, the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP).

Many continental flood basalt events coincide with continental rifting. This is consistent with a system that tends toward equilibrium: as matter rises in a mantle plume, other material is drawn down into the mantle, causing rifting.

==Alternative hypotheses==
In parallel with the mantle plume model, two alternative explanations for the observed phenomena have been considered: the plate hypothesis and the impact hypothesis.

===The plate hypothesis===
Since the beginning of the 21st century, a paradigm debate &quot;The great plume debate&quot; has developed around plumes, in which the plume hypothesis has been challenged and contrasted with the more recent plate hypothesis (&quot;Plates vs. Plumes&quot;). The reason for this is that the mantle-plume hypothesis has not been suitable for making reliable predictions since its introduction in 1971 and has therefore been repeatedly adapted to observed hotspots depending on the situation. Over time, with the growing number of models, the concept of a plume developed into a weakly defined hypothesis, which as a general term is currently neither provable nor refutable.
The dissatisfaction with the state of the evidence for mantle plumes and the proliferation of ad hoc hypotheses drove a number of geologists, led by Don L. Anderson, Gillian Foulger, and Warren B. Hamilton, to propose a broad alternative based on shallow processes in the upper mantle and above, with an emphasis on plate tectonics as the driving force of magmatism.

The plate hypothesis suggests that &quot;anomalous&quot; volcanism results from lithospheric extension that permits melt to rise passively from the asthenosphere beneath. It is thus the conceptual inverse of the plume hypothesis because the plate hypothesis attributes volcanism to shallow, near-surface processes associated with plate tectonics, rather than active processes arising at the core-mantle boundary.

Lithospheric extension is attributed to processes related to plate tectonics. These processes are well understood at mid-ocean ridges, where most of Earth&#x27;s volcanism occurs. It is less commonly recognised that the plates themselves deform internally, and can permit volcanism in those regions where the deformation is extensional. Well-known examples are the Basin and Range Province in the western USA, the East African Rift valley, and the Rhine Graben. Under this hypothesis, variable volumes of magma are attributed to variations in chemical composition (large volumes of volcanism corresponding to more easily molten mantle material) rather than to temperature differences.

While not denying the presence of deep mantle convection and upwelling in general, the plate hypothesis holds that these processes do not result in mantle plumes, in the sense of columnar vertical features that span most of the Earth&#x27;s mantle, transport large amounts of heat, and contribute to surface volcanism.

Under the umbrella of the plate hypothesis, the following sub-processes, all of which can contribute to permitting surface volcanism, are recognised:
*Continental break-up;
*Fertility at mid-ocean ridges;
*Enhanced volcanism at plate boundary junctions;
*Small-scale sublithospheric convection;
*Oceanic intraplate extension;
*Slab tearing and break-off;
*Shallow mantle convection;
*Abrupt lateral changes in stress at structural discontinuities;
*Continental intraplate extension;
*Catastrophic lithospheric thinning;
*Sublithospheric melt ponding and draining.

===The impact hypothesis===

In addition to these processes, impact events such as ones that created the Addams crater on Venus and the Sudbury Igneous Complex in Canada are known to have caused melting and volcanism. In the impact hypothesis, it is proposed that some regions of hotspot volcanism can be triggered by certain large-body oceanic impacts which are able to penetrate the thinner oceanic lithosphere, and flood basalt volcanism can be triggered by converging seismic energy focused at the antipodal point opposite major impact sites. Impact-induced volcanism has not been adequately studied and comprises a separate causal category of terrestrial volcanism with implications for the study of hotspots and plate tectonics.

===Comparison of the hypotheses===
In 1997 it became possible using seismic tomography to image submerging tectonic slabs penetrating from the surface all the way to the core-mantle boundary.

For the Hawaii hotspot, long-period seismic body wave diffraction tomography provided evidence that a mantle plume is responsible, as had been proposed as early as 1971. For the Yellowstone hotspot, seismological evidence began to converge from 2011 in support of the plume model, as concluded by James et al., &quot;we favor a lower mantle plume as the origin for the Yellowstone hotspot.&quot; Data acquired through Earthscope, a program collecting high-resolution seismic data throughout the contiguous United States has accelerated acceptance of a plume underlying Yellowstone.

Although there is thus strong evidence that at least these two deep mantle plumes rise from the core-mantle boundary, confirmation that other hypotheses can be dismissed may require similar tomographic evidence for other hotspots.

<text>GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD Law) is a non-profit legal rights organization in the United States. The organization works to end discrimination based on sexual orientation, HIV status, and gender identity and expression. The organization primarily achieves this goal through litigation, advocacy, and education work in all areas of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) rights and the rights of people living with HIV. In addition, GLAD Law operates a legal information line, GLAD Law Answers, where LGBTQ &amp; HIV+ residents of New England can receive attorney referrals and information about their rights. The organization changed its name to GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders in February 2016.

GLAD Law is based in Boston, Massachusetts, and serves the New England area of Northeastern United States.

==Background==
GLAD Law was originally called the Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders. It was founded by John Ward in 1978, in response to a sting operation conducted by Boston police that resulted in the arrest of more than a hundred men in the men&#x27;s rooms of the main building of the Boston Public Library. GLAD Law filed its first case, &quot;Doe v. McNiff&quot;, that same year and eventually all those arrested were either found not guilty or had the charges against them dismissed. An early victory came in &quot;Fricke v. Lynch&quot; (1980), in which GLAD Law represented Aaron Fricke, an 18-year-old student at Cumberland High School in Rhode Island, who won the right to bring a same-sex date to a high school dance.

==Notable cases==
* Fricke v. Lynch: GLAD Law founder John Ward won a ruling from the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island on May 28, 1980, that the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s guarantee of free speech prohibits a public school from denying a student the right to attend a school prom with a same-sex date.
* Hurley v. GLIB: GLAD Law founder John Ward became the first openly gay man to argue in front of the Supreme Court in defense of the rights of Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Group of Boston to march in South Boston&#x27;s annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade. Massachusetts courts had affirmed that the group had the right to march. In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decisions of the Massachusetts court, barring them from marching in the parade.
* Bragdon v. Abbott: In 1995, GLAD Law&#x27;s case established that people with HIV and AIDS are protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). It was the first case that the U.S. Supreme Court had ever heard on the ADA, and the first involving HIV.
* Doe v. Yunits: In 2000, GLAD Law brought a case to the Massachusetts Superior Court on behalf of a transgender student, Katrina, who had been disciplined for wearing the clothing that matched her female identity. The Superior Court ruled that a middle school may not prohibit a transgender student from expressing her female gender identity. It was the first reported decision in a case brought by a transgender student.
* O&#x27;Donnabhain v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue: On February 2, 2010, the U.S. Tax Court ruled that treatment for gender dysphoria qualifies as medical care under the Internal Revenue Code and is therefore tax deductible.
* Miller-Jenkins v. Miller-Jenkins (2006). This case involved a custody dispute between two mothers and their daughter.
* Doe v. Regional School Unit 26 (2014): The Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruled that denying a transgender girl the use of a girls&#x27; restroom at her school violated her rights under the state&#x27;s Human Rights Act. This case marked the first time that a state court ruled denying a transgender student access to the bathroom consistent with their gender identity is unlawful.
* DeBoer v. Snyder (2015): GLAD Law&#x27;s Civil Rights Project Director, Mary Bonauto, argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on April 28, 2015, on behalf of same-sex couples seeking the right to marry. This case was consolidated with Obergefell v. Hodges, and concluded in the landmark 5-4 Supreme Court decision guaranteeing a right to marriage.

==Work on marriage equality==
In 1997, GLAD Law, along with Beth Robinson and Susan Murray filed a lawsuit, &quot;Baker v. Vermont&quot; on behalf of three Vermont couples seeking the right to marry. On December 20, 1999, The Vermont Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples must be granted the same legal benefits, protections, and obligations as marriage under Vermont law. As a direct result of this decision in 2000 Vermont became the first state to allow same-sex couples to enter a legal relationship equal to marriage, known in Vermont as a civil union.

In 2003, GLAD Law received national attention for its work in winning marriage rights for same-sex couples in Massachusetts. In &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot;, it successfully argued before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that to restrict marriage to heterosexual couples was a violation of the state constitution. In October 2008, GLAD Law won marriage rights for same-sex couples in Connecticut with a decision of the Supreme Court of Connecticut in &quot;Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health&quot;.

On November 18, 2008, the fifth anniversary of &quot;Goodridge&quot;, GLAD Law, working with other statewide groups, launched a project called the &quot;Six by Twelve&quot; campaign that aimed to bring same-sex marriage to all six New England states by 2012. The campaign aimed to make New England a &quot;marriage equality zone.&quot; The campaign worked primarily through state legislatures and hoped to provide a road map for the rest of the country in 2012. Within six months, same-sex marriage laws were passed in three more states, but the Maine law was repealed by the voters on November 3, 2009. After this decision by the voters, along with a coalition of other civil rights groups, GLAD Law proceeded with a two-year public education campaign in Maine. On June 30, 2011, EqualityMaine and GLAD Law announced plans to place a voter initiative in support of same-sex marriage on Maine&#x27;s November 2012 ballot. The voter initiative passed, making Maine the first state to legalize same sex marriage through a ballot vote. On May 2, 2013, the &quot;Six by Twelve&quot; campaign came to a close when Rhode Island&#x27;s legislature passed a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry and Governor Lincoln Chafee signed it into law.

When it filed &quot;Gill v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; in March 2009, GLAD Law became the first organization to file a federal court challenge to Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) that prevented the federal government from recognizing the validity of same-sex marriages. On November 9, 2010, GLAD Law filed a second challenge to Section 3 with &quot;Pedersen v. Office of Personnel Management&quot;. It won both cases in U.S. District Court and in the First and Second Circuit Courts of Appeals, respectively. In July and August 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed certiorari petitions in the U.S. Supreme Court in both those cases. The Supreme Court chose instead to review &quot;Windsor v. United States&quot;.

<text>An aril (), also called an arillus, is a specialized outgrowth from a seed that partly or completely covers the seed. An arillode or false aril is sometimes distinguished: whereas an aril grows from the attachment point of the seed to the ovary (from the funiculus or &quot;hilum&quot;), an arillode forms from a different point on the seed coat. The term &quot;aril&quot; is sometimes applied to any fleshy appendage of the seed in flowering plants, such as the mace of the nutmeg seed. Arils and arillodes are often edible enticements that encourage animals to transport the seed, thereby assisting in seed dispersal. Pseudarils are aril-like structures commonly found on the pyrenes of Burseraceae species that develop from the mesocarp of the ovary. The fleshy, edible pericarp splits neatly in two halves, then falling away or being eaten to reveal a brightly coloured pseudaril around the black seed.

The aril may create a fruit-like structure, called (among other names) a &quot;false fruit&quot;. False fruit are found in numerous Angiosperm taxa. The edible false fruit of the longan, lychee and ackee fruits are highly developed arils surrounding the seed rather than a pericarp layer. Such arils are also found in a few species of gymnosperms, notably the yews and related conifers such as the lleuque and the kahikatea. Instead of the woody cone typical of most gymnosperms, the reproductive structure of the yew consists of a single seed that becomes surrounded by a fleshy, cup-like covering. This covering is derived from a highly modified cone scale.

==Development in &quot;Taxus&quot;==
In European yew plants (&quot;Taxus baccata&quot;), the aril starts out as a small, green band at the base of the seed, then turns brown to red as it enlarges and surrounds the seed, eventually becoming fleshy and scarlet in color at maturity. The aril is attractive to fruit-eating birds and is non-toxic. All other parts of the yew are toxic, including the seed housed inside the aril. If the seed is crushed, breaks or splits in the stomach of a human, bird or another animal, it will result in poisoning. Birds digest the fleshy aril as a food source, and pass the seeds out in their droppings, promoting dispersal of the seeds.

==In &quot;Dacrycarpus dacrydioides&quot;==

The kahikatea tree, &quot;Dacrycarpus dacrydioides&quot;, is native to New Zealand. In pre-European times the aril of the kahikatea was a food source for Māori. The washed arils were called and were eaten raw.

<text>The Scottish court in the Netherlands was a special sitting of the High Court of Justiciary set up under Scots law in a former United States Air Force base, Camp Zeist near Utrecht, in the Netherlands, for the trial of two Libyans charged with 270 counts of murder in connection with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on 21 December 1988. A school on the former base was converted into a judicial court for the trial.

==Neutral country==

The court was established in a neutral country as part of a deal between Colonel Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and the British government, before Gaddafi would allow the extradition of the two accused.

==Special jurisdiction on territory==
Under a bilateral treaty between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the premises of the court were, for the duration of the trial and any subsequent appeal, under the authority and control of the court. Since the arrangement had been called for by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1192, it was given effect in Scots law by an Order-in-Council under the United Nations Act 1946. Dutch law still theoretically applied to the area, but, barring an emergency, the Dutch authorities were banned from entering the premises and the court had the authority to enact regulations that superseded Dutch law when necessary for the execution of the trial, and to jail people for contempt of court. The court itself, as well as people involved in the trial (officials of the court, accused, witnesses, solicitors, etc.), also enjoyed total or partial immunity from Dutch law.

==Verdict==
The court convicted Abdelbaset al-Megrahi of 270 counts of murder in connection with the bombing on 31 January 2001. The second accused, Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, was acquitted. Megrahi&#x27;s appeal was also held at the court (the High Court of Justiciary is the highest court of appeal in the Scottish criminal justice system), and was rejected on 14 March 2002. The site was then decommissioned and returned to the Dutch government. Megrahi served his sentence at Greenock prison in Inverclyde.

From September 2003, Megrahi&#x27;s conviction was under review by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, which reported its findings on 28 June 2007 and granted Megrahi leave for a second appeal against conviction.

Diagnosed with prostate cancer and with an estimated three- to six-month life expectancy, Megrahi was released from Greenock prison in August 2009 after serving eight years, through a decision on compassionate grounds by the Scottish justice minister, Kenny MacAskill. He returned to Libya, where he died in May 2012.

<doc id="377767" wikidata="Q1994415" url="?curid=377767" title="No, No, Nanette">
<text>No, No, Nanette is a musical with a book by Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel based on Mandel&#x27;s 1919 Broadway play &quot;My Lady Friends&quot;; lyrics by Irving Caesar and Harbach; and music by Vincent Youmans. The farcical story centers on three couples who find themselves together at a cottage in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the midst of a blackmail scheme focusing on a fun-loving Manhattan heiress who has run off, leaving an unhappy fiancé. Its songs include the well-known &quot;Tea for Two&quot; and &quot;I Want to Be Happy&quot;. 

After a pre-Broadway tour in 1924, the musical was revised for a production later 1924 in Chicago, where it became a hit and ran for more than a year. In 1925 &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; opened both on Broadway and in London&#x27;s West End, running for 321 and 665 performances, respectively. Film versions (1930 and 1940) and revivals followed. A Broadway revival in 1971, with the book adapted by Burt Shevelove, was a success, running for 861 performances.

A popular myth holds that the show was financed by selling baseball&#x27;s Boston Red Sox superstar Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees, resulting in the &quot;Curse of the Bambino.&quot; However, it was Mandel&#x27;s original play, &quot;My Lady Friends&quot;, rather than &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, that was directly financed by the Ruth sale.

==History==
===Original production and aftermath===
&quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; was not successful in its first pre-Broadway tour in 1924. When the production arrived in Chicago, producer Harry Frazee re-cast the show with new stars, had the book rewritten and asked Youmans and Caesar to write additional songs. These additional songs, &quot;Tea for Two&quot; and &quot;I Want to Be Happy&quot;, would become the hit songs of the show. The Chicago production was a hit and ran for over a year. Frazee capitalized on this success by mounting a production in the West End in London. The show opened on March 11, 1925, at the Palace Theatre, where it starred Binnie Hale, Joseph Coyne and George Grossmith Jr. and became a hit, running for 665 performances. The London production featured two songs that were not included in the earlier U.S. productions: &quot;I&#x27;ve Confessed to the Breeze&quot; and &quot;Take a Little One-Step&quot;. Three touring productions were circulating throughout the U.S. when the Broadway production finally opened on September 16, 1925, at the Globe Theatre, starring Louise Groody and Charles Winninger. It ran for 321 performances.

The musical was translated into various languages and enjoyed regional productions, U.S. tours and international success through the end of the decade. It was made into films in both 1930 and 1940, with both film adaptations featuring ZaSu Pitts. A 1950 film, &quot;Tea for Two&quot;, was a very loose adaptation of the show. It starred Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, Eve Arden (who was also in the 1940 film), and Billy DeWolfe. The musical was seen with decreasing frequency in the following decades.

In 1926 Frazee produced what he marketed as a companion musical to &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; at the Four Cohans Theatre in Chicago: the musical &quot;Yes, Yes, Yvette&quot;. It premiered on December 5, 1926, to positive reviews in the Chicago press and in &quot;Billboard&quot;. After the production had a successful run in Chicago, it was a flop on Broadway in 1927.

===1971 revival and later productions===
For the nostalgic 1971 Broadway revival conceived and produced by Harry Rigby, Burt Shevelove freely adapted the book from the 1925 original. While the 1925 book was considered quite racy at the time of the original production, Shevelove wrote from a nostalgic perspective, depicting the 1920s as a time of innocent fun. He made extensive changes and cuts to the book, but most of the original score was left intact, with only a few cuts and interpolations. The cast featured veteran screen star Ruby Keeler and included Helen Gallagher, Bobby Van, Jack Gilford, Patsy Kelly and Susan Watson. A young Ed Dixon was in the ensemble. Busby Berkeley, nearing the end of his career, was credited as supervising the production, although members of the cast and crew later stated that his name was his primary contribution to the show. Among a number of extensive dance sequences, Keeler – who returned from retirement for the production – was lauded for energetic tap routines incorporated into &quot;I Want to Be Happy&quot; and &quot;Take a Little One-Step&quot;. Rigby&#x27;s acrimonious relationship with fellow producer Cyma Rubin led to Rubin&#x27;s terminating Rigby&#x27;s contract and removing his credit as co-producer, but insiders claimed he deserved full credit for the show&#x27;s success. Rigby later accepted a $300,000 settlement from Rubin.

The 1971 production was well-reviewed and ran for 861 performances. It sparked interest in the revival of similar musicals from the 1920s and 1930s. Tony and Drama Desk Awards went to costume designer Raoul Pène Du Bois, choreographer Donald Saddler, and Gallagher as best leading actress; Kelly won a Tony as best featured actress, and Shevelove earned a Drama Desk Award for outstanding book. This production transferred to London in 1973, with a cast starring Anna Neagle, Anne Rogers, Tony Britton and Teddy Green. Further tours and international productions followed. Performance rights are available for the 1971 version, which has become the most frequently performed musical of the 1920s.

City Center&#x27;s Encores! presented a semi-staged production of &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; in May 2008, directed by Walter Bobbie, with choreography by Randy Skinner, starring Sandy Duncan, Beth Leavel and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell.

===Curse of the Bambino===
Some years after the premiere, it was claimed that producer Harry Frazee, a former owner of the Boston Red Sox, financed &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; by selling baseball superstar Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees, resulting in the &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot;, which, according to a popular superstition, kept the Red Sox from winning the World Series from until . In the 1990s, that story was partially debunked on the grounds that the sale of Ruth had occurred five years earlier. Leigh Montville discovered during research for his 2006 book, &quot;The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth&quot;, that &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; had originated as a non-musical stage play called &quot;My Lady Friends&quot;, which opened on Broadway in December 1919. That play had, indeed, been financed by the Ruth sale to the Yankees.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Based on 1971 Revised Production&quot;

;Act I: 1925. The home of James Smith, New York City. 
Jimmy Smith, a millionaire Bible publisher, is married to the overly frugal Sue. Jimmy thus has plenty of disposable income, and, because he likes to use his money to make people happy, he has secretly become the (platonic) benefactor of three beautiful women: Betty from Boston, Winnie from Washington, D.C., and Flora from San Francisco. Sue&#x27;s best friend, Lucille, is married to Jimmy&#x27;s lawyer and friend, Billy Early. Lucille is a spendthrift and delights in spending all the money Billy makes. Jimmy and Sue have a young ward, Nanette, who they hope will become a respectable young lady. At Jimmy and Sue&#x27;s home in New York, many young men come to call on Nanette. Lucille advises the young people that having one steady boyfriend is better than many flirtations (&quot;Too Many Rings Around Rosie&quot;). Tom Trainor, Billy&#x27;s nephew and assistant, works up the courage to tell Nanette that he loves her, and she returns his sentiments (&quot;I&#x27;ve Confessed to the Breeze&quot;). Tom wants to settle down and get married as soon as possible, but Nanette has an untapped wild side and wants to have some fun first.

Jimmy&#x27;s lady friends are attempting to blackmail him, and he, afraid that Sue will find out about them, enlists Billy&#x27;s legal help to discreetly ease the girls out of his life. Billy suggests that Jimmy take refuge in Philadelphia. Unknown to Jimmy, Billy decides to take Tom and meet the three ladies at the Smiths&#x27; seaside home, Chickadee Cottage, in Atlantic City, New Jersey (&quot;Call of the Sea&quot;). Sue and Lucille, hearing that both their husbands will be away on business, also decide to take a vacation to the cottage.

Nanette wants to go to Atlantic City with her friends, but Sue forbids her to go. Jimmy, wanting to make Nanette happy, gives her $200 and agrees to secretly take her to Chickadee Cottage, with the grumpy cook, Pauline, acting as Nanette&#x27;s chaperone (&quot;I Want to Be Happy&quot;). Nanette is tired of everyone (especially Tom) trying to control her behavior and dreams of the extravagant fun she will have (&quot;No No Nanette&quot;). To tease Tom, she shows him the $200 and refuses to tell him how she got it. Tom angrily breaks off his relationship with Nanette, and, under the pretense that she is going to visit her grandmother in Trenton, New Jersey, Nanette leaves for Atlantic City (Finaletto Act I).

;Act II: The garden and living room of Chickadee Cottage, Atlantic City.
Nanette arrives in Atlantic City and quickly becomes the most popular girl on the beach (&quot;Peach on the Beach&quot;). Meanwhile, Jimmy crosses paths with his three girlfriends, who confront him with the promises he made to them (&quot;The Three Happies&quot;). Tom meets up with Nanette, and they resolve their quarrel, fantasizing about being happily married one day (&quot;Tea for Two&quot;). Lucille runs into Billy, and though she is surprised to meet him in Atlantic City, she assures him that she does not mind whether he spends time with other women as long as she&#x27;s there to watch – and he comes home with her at the end of the evening (&quot;You Can Dance with Any Girl At All&quot;).

Sue is shocked to find Nanette in Atlantic City. Nanette at first lies and said she was only visiting her grandmother in Trenton, but Sue knows that cannot be true: Nanette&#x27;s only living grandmother lives in Omaha, Nebraska. Nanette admits that she actually spent the night in Atlantic City. Against her protests, Sue arranges for her to go back to New York with Pauline. Sue overhears Billy speaking to the women and, assuming that he is having an affair with them, tells Lucille. Billy, to keep Jimmy&#x27;s secret, does not deny it, and Lucille says she is leaving him. Meanwhile, Tom, shocked by Nanette&#x27;s behavior, breaks off their relationship. Jimmy is oblivious to the confusion he&#x27;s created (Finaletto Act II).

;Act III
Billy tries to call Lucille on the telephone, but she refuses to answer. Flora, Winnie, and Betty tempt him to spend time with them instead (&quot;Telephone Girlie&quot;). Lucille, finding herself alone, realizes that she misses Billy, and nothing else can make her feel better (&quot;Where-Has-My-Hubby-Gone Blues&quot;). The truth begins to emerge as Lucille realizes that Billy cannot be the benefactor of the three girls; he never has any money to spend because Lucille spends it all! Jimmy finally pays off the ladies, and finally the truth comes out: Billy has not been cheating on Lucille, and though Jimmy has been spending his money on the three girls, it is strictly platonic.

Nanette and Pauline, unable to catch a train to New York, return to the cottage, where Tom and Nanette make up; however, it appears that once more, Tom wants to settle down while Nanette wants to enjoy being single. Tom produces a magnificent engagement ring, and Nanette has a change of heart, now insisting that they should get married today (&quot;Waiting for You&quot;). Sue and Lucille decide that in order to ensure Jimmy never again has philandering opportunities, Sue must spend all of Jimmy&#x27;s money herself. The show ends with a tea dance, where Sue wows Jimmy with a fancy dress and a final dance number (&quot;Take a Little One-Step&quot;; &quot;Finale&quot;).

==Critical reception==
The original Broadway production opened to positive reviews; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Herman J. Mankiewicz pronounced it &quot;full of much vigorous merriment and many agreeable tunes,&quot; and &quot;a highly meritorious paradigm of its kind.&quot; It acknowledged that the plot was slight but praised the score, noting that &quot;I Want to be Happy&quot; and &quot;Tea for Two&quot; were already hit tunes (having premiered in the Chicago production the previous year). Robert C. Benchley in &quot;Life&quot; magazine admitted &quot;We had a preconceived notion that &quot;No, No, Nanette!&quot; was a pretty dull show, probably because it had been running so long before it came to New York...&quot;No, No, Nanette!&quot; is really very amusing.&quot; Charles Winninger, in the role of Jimmy Smith, received particular praise for his comedic abilities. The &quot;New York Times&quot; proclaimed &quot;Winninger gave the greatest performance of his career...it was a more than hardened theatre-goer who was not moved to near hysterics by his every appearance.&quot; Benchley stated that &quot;Winninger and Wellington Cross, with that ease and facile kidding which comes to comedians after a long run, are a highly comic pair.&quot;

The 1971 revival also received almost uniformly positive reviews from major newspapers, which welcomed its innocent nostalgia. Clive Barnes of the &quot;New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;For everyone who wishes the world were 50 years younger ... the revival of the 1925 musical &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot; should provide a delightful, carefree evening. ... This is far closer to a musical of the twenties than anything New York has seen since the twenties, but it is seen through a contemporary sensibility.&quot; Douglas Watt, in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, agreed. However, there was some critical disagreement concerning the overall tone of the production. The &quot;New York Times&quot; thought it &quot;attractively tongue-in-cheek&quot;, while John O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; deemed it &quot;a sparkling revival&quot; that was &quot;spiked with jiggers of self-conscious and self-congratulatory camp.&quot; T. E. Kalem, in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, stated: &quot;The show is a copious delight, but it has a sizable temperamental flaw. No strict decision was made as to whether it should be played straight or campy.&quot; Jack Kroll of &quot;Newsweek&quot; considered it a sincere representation of the 1920s, declaring it a &quot;very moving show.&quot;

Ruby Keeler&#x27;s tap-dancing and charm in the revival were widely praised; Richard Watts in the &quot;New York Post&quot; stated &quot;Ruby Keeler, looking every bit as attractive as in her heyday as a film star, can still do a tap dance or a soft shoe number that is a joy.&quot; O&#x27;Connor found her charming and warm, writing, &quot;she smartly whisks the delirious audience right back to those good old Busby Berkeley movies.&quot; The score was also lauded. Barnes stated &quot;the melodies are light, cheerful and exuberant&quot;, and the lyrics &quot;[deserve] a place in any museum of American musical comedy, and yet live wonderfully today.&quot; Multiple critics cited Busby Berkeley&#x27;s supervision as a contributing factor to the show&#x27;s success; Kroll asked rhetorically &quot;the production has dignity, taste and wit, and how else could it be under the aegis of 75-year-old Busby Berkeley, that authentic genius of the old Hollywood musicals?&quot; Stage veterans Bobby Van and Helen Gallagher received particular praise for their performances. O&#x27;Connor stated that &quot;the best performances came from Bobby Van as the suave, debonair dancing lawyer...and the adorable Helen Gallagher as his short-suffering wife.&quot; Watt pronounced Van &quot;a hoofer par excellence&quot; and said that Gallagher gave &quot;a most stylish performance.&quot;

<doc id="377778" wikidata="Q3138082" url="?curid=377778" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Tanzania">
<text>The story of the postage stamps and postal history of Tanzania begins with German East Africa, which was occupied by British forces during World War I. After the war, the territory came under British rule, was named Tanganyika and issued stamps under that name until after a union with Zanzibar in 1964.

== First stamps ==
The first issue of Tanzania proper was a set of four commemorative stamps marking the union, issued 7 July 1964. Inscribed &quot;UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANGANYIKA &amp; ZANZIBAR&quot;, two values depict a map of the coast from Tanga to Dar-es-Salaam along with Zanzibar and Pemba, while other two show hands holding a torch and spear.

== Later issues ==
The first definitive series inscribed Tanzania was issued 9 December 1965, and consisted of a set of 14 values ranging from 5 cents to 20 shillings, depicting a variety of scenes, symbols, and wildlife.

The stamps of Tanzania were also valid in Kenya and Uganda (until 1976), and so Tanzania did not typically issue its own commemoratives. A definitives series issued 9 December 1967 featured various fish, and series of 15 stamps from 3 December 1973 depicted butterflies. Four of these values were surcharged 17 November 1975.

In 1976 and 1977, Tanzania issued eight commemorative sets that shared design with the stamps of Kenya, and after that it issued its own designs.

==85th birthday of the Queen Mother==
In 1985, Clive Feigenbaum was the organiser of stamps of Tanzania to mark the 85th birthday of H.M. The Queen Mother. The stamps had to be reprinted when it emerged that the original designs were marked &quot;85th Year of H.R.H. The Queen Mother&quot; rather than &quot;85th Birthday of H.M. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother&quot;. The stamps, printed by Holders Press, were eventually issued in corrected form on 30 September 1985 while the original printing was not issued in Tanzania. The British Crown Agents recommended that the original stamps be destroyed, however, they continue to be available on eBay and through stamp dealers. Holders Press went on to produce a number of further stamp issues for Tanzania.

== Recent stamps ==
Stamp-issuing policy was relatively restrained in the 1980s, with about 7-8 special issues each year, typically of four stamps each, and a definitive series of mammals in 1980, but by the end of the decade the postal administration had begun putting out large numbers of issues aimed solely at stamp collectors, with averages of over 100 types annually. Tanzania is a client of the Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation.

<text> (; ) was a nationwide judicial investigation into political corruption in Italy held in the early 1990s, resulting in the demise of the First Italian Republic and the disappearance of many political parties. Some politicians and industry leaders committed suicide after their crimes were exposed. Antonio Di Pietro was the main judicial figure in charge of the investigation. In some accounts, as many as 5,000 public figures fell under suspicion. At one point, more than half of the members of the Italian Parliament were under indictment, while more than 400 city and town councils were dissolved because of corruption charges. The estimated value of bribes paid annually in the 1980s by Italian and foreign companies bidding for large government contracts reached US$4 billion (6.5 trillion lire).

The corrupt system uncovered by the investigation was referred to as Tangentopoli (). The term derives from Italian &quot;tangente&quot;, which means &quot;kickback&quot;, and in this context refers to kickbacks given for public works contracts, and Greek &quot;polis&quot; meaning &quot;city&quot;; it is thus sometimes translated as &quot;Bribesville&quot; or &quot;Kickback City&quot;. Former Italian prime minister Bettino Craxi became the main figure of the scandal and defended himself by saying that all parties did what he was accused of; Craxi, who fled to Hammamet, Tunisia, in 1994, was convicted twice for corruption and illicit financing to political parties and had four more trials pending by the time of his death in 2000. The Italian Communist Party (PCI) and some of its former members, mainly of its right wing, were also investigated but were acquitted.

The media impact and the climate of public indignation that followed were such as to decree the collapse of the then political system and the beginning of the Second Italian Republic, as historical parties, such as Christian Democracy (DC) and the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) dissolved, being replaced in Parliament in subsequent elections by newly formed parties, or those that had previously been in the minority or opposition, such as the Federation of the Greens (FdV) and Lega Nord (LN). Even without a formal change of regime, there was a profound change in the party system and a turnover of part of its national representatives. Eventually, all four parties in the 1992 government disappeared, at different times in different ways: the DC, the PSI, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (PSDI), and the Italian Liberal Party (PLI). The Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the Italian Republican Party (PRI), and the Italian Social Movement (MSI) were the only surviving national parties; the PRI is the only one that maintained its name since.

== Arrest of Mario Chiesa ==
&quot;Tangentopoli&quot;, as the scandal came to be called, began on 17 February 1992 when Antonio Di Pietro, the judge who became most associated with the investigation, had Mario Chiesa, a member of the PSI, arrested for accepting a bribe from a Milan cleaning firm. The PSI distanced themselves from Chiesa, with party leader Bettino Craxi calling him &quot;mariuolo&quot;, or &quot;villain&quot;, a &quot;wild splinter&quot; of an otherwise clean party. Upset over this treatment by his former colleagues, Chiesa began to give information about corruption implicating them. This marked the beginning of the &quot;Mani pulite&quot; investigation; news of political corruption began spreading in the Italian press. &quot;Tangentopoli&quot; itself refers to a series of judicial investigations conducted by various judicial prosecutors&#x27; offices, in particular that of Milan, which revealed a fraudulent or corrupt system that colluded with politics and Italian entrepreneurship.

== Extension of anti-corruption investigations ==
In the 1992 Italian general election, the DC held on to power when its coalition government kept a small majority, while leftist opposition parties gained support. The PCI split after the fall of the Soviet Union, depriving the opposition of leadership. Many votes went to the regionalist LN, which was not inclined to form alliances with other parties at the time. The resulting Parliament was therefore weak and difficult to bring to an agreement.

In April 1992, many industrial figures and politicians from both the government and the opposition were arrested on charges of corruption. While the investigations started in Milan, they quickly spread to other areas as more politicians confessed. Fundamental to this increased exposure was the general attitude of the main politicians to drop support for subordinates who got caught; this made many of them feel betrayed, and they often implicated many other figures, who in turn would implicate even more. On 2 September 1992, the PSI politician Sergio Moroni, who had been charged with corruption, committed suicide, leaving behind a letter declaring that his crimes were not for his personal gain but for the party&#x27;s benefit.

== Effect on national politics ==

In local elections in December 1992, held in eight &quot;comuni&quot; (municipalities), the DC lost half of their votes. The following day, Bettino Craxi was officially accused of corruption; he eventually resigned as leader of the PSI. On 5 March 1993, the government of Giuliano Amato (PSI) and his justice minister Giovanni Conso (independent) tried to find a solution with a decree, which allowed criminal charges for several bribery-related crimes to be replaced by administrative charges instead; according to popular opinion at the time, that would have resulted in a &quot;de facto&quot; amnesty for most corruption charges. Amid public outrage and nationwide rallies, the then Italian president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro (DC) refused to sign the decree, deeming it unconstitutional. The following week, a US$250 million scandal involving Eni, the government-controlled energy company, was revealed. The stream of accusations, confessions, and jailing continued.

On 25 March 1993, the Parliament changed municipal electoral law in favor of a majoritarian system. Later on 18 April 1993, the public overwhelmingly backed the abrogation of the existing proportional representation system in a referendum (mixed-member proportional representation was introduced that August), causing Amato to resign three days later. Still shocked by the recent events, the Parliament was unable to produce a new government. Carlo Azeglio Ciampi (independent), former governor of the Bank of Italy, was appointed head of the government; he appointed a technical government without political influences. Meanwhile, the Parliament blocked the investigation into Craxi, causing several cabinet ministers including Francesco Rutelli (FdV) and Vincenzo Visco (independent) to resign in protest after three days at their posts. In new local elections on 6 June 1993, the DC lost half of its votes once again; the PSI virtually disappeared. Instead, LN became the strongest political force in northern Italy. 

== Cusani trial ==

On 20 July 1993, the former Eni president Gabriele Cagliari committed suicide in jail. His wife later gave back US$3 million of illegal funds. Meanwhile, Sergio Cusani faced trial and was accused of crimes connected to Enimont, a joint venture between Eni and another energy company, Montedison. The trial was broadcast on national television and was a sort of showcase of the old politics being brought to their responsibilities. While Cusani himself was not a major figure, the connection of his crimes to the Enimont affair called in all the nation&#x27;s major politicians as witnesses.

A high note was reached in the Cusani trial when former head of government Arnaldo Forlani (DC), answering a question, simply said: &quot;I don&#x27;t remember.&quot; He happened to be very nervous and did not notice that perspiration was accumulating on his lips, and that image was by many considered symbolic of the people&#x27;s disgust for the corrupt system. Instead, Craxi admitted that his party received $93 million of illegal funds, defending his actions by saying that &quot;everyone was doing this&quot;. Even the LN was implicated in the trial; secretary Umberto Bossi and former treasurer Alessandro Patelli were convicted for receiving 200 million lire of illegal funding (approximately $100,000 at the time).

A bribe to the PCI was alleged but was not established who had committed the offence. A number of Milanese members of the PDS, mainly of the &quot;migliorista&quot; wing, were charged with corruption during their time as members of the PCI but were acquitted. Prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro stated: &quot;Penal responsibility is personal, I cannot bring here a person with the first name Party and last name Communist.&quot; The Enimont trial itself was carried out after the Cusani trial, with much less public interest.

== Investigations on other fronts ==
In the meantime, the investigation expanded outside the political range. On 2 September 1993, the Milan judge Diego Curtò was arrested. On 21 April 1994, 80 financial regulators and 300 industry personalities were charged with corruption. A few days later, the secretary of Fiat admitted corruption with a letter to a newspaper. Media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi entered politics later that year and won the 1994 Italian general election in what many thought was a move to shield his many business concerns from possible scrutiny. This suspicion was reinforced on 11 February 1994, when his brother, Paolo Berlusconi, admitted to corruption crimes. On 29 July 1994, his brother was again arrested and immediately released.

== &quot;Lottizzazione&quot; ==
The term &quot;lottizzazione&quot;, meaning the way a terrain is divided up in minor parts or &quot;lotti&quot;, came to indicate the procedure of awarding top positions in important state conglomerates, such as IRI, Enel, or Eni to political figures, or at least managers with a clear political orientation. This usually trickled down to lower levels, creating power centres depending on political parties that controlled a significant part of the production system. The available seats were usually awarded so that government parties and opposition parties like the PCI would get a share of power corresponding to their perceived influence in the government.

== Impact ==
A 2020 study found that

== In modern culture ==
In 2005, artist Gianni Motti created an artwork in the form of a bar of soap, named &quot;Mani pulite&quot;, based on the scandal. This piece was claimed to have been created out of the fat from a liposuction of Silvio Berlusconi. It was sold at the 36th edition of Art Basel for €15,000. A 2015 television series titled &quot;1992&quot; is based on the events of &quot;Mani pulite&quot;.

<doc id="377785" wikidata="Q3988899" url="?curid=377785" title="The Quebecers">
<text>The Quebecers were a professional wrestling tag team in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from in between 1993 and 1994 and again in 1998 who consisted of Quebecer Jacques and Quebecer Pierre. They also worked as The Amazing French-Canadians in World Championship Wrestling under their given names from 1996 to 1997.

==History==
Jacques Rougeau had previously worked for the WWF both as a tag team wrestler with his brother Raymond Rougeau as The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers and later on as a singles wrestler under the name The Mountie (the Quebecers have since been sometimes confused with the Rougeau Brothers). Pierre had worked on the independent circuit until 1993 where he met Jacques Rougeau in Puerto Rico.

===World Wrestling Federation===
Jacques and Pierre were paired up by the WWF, dressed in red and black uniforms that were reminiscent of Jacques’ previous identity as “The Mountie”. They even played off Vince McMahon&#x27;s legal troubles over the Mountie gimmick by giving the team a theme song that said &quot;We&#x27;re Not the Mounties&quot;, but otherwise was the same as Jacques’ “Mountie” theme song. They were also teamed up with a young charismatic talker, Johnny Polo, who portrayed a preppy rich kid.

They debuted on the July 24, 1993 episode of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; and were quickly pushed to the top of the tag team division, challenging The Steiner Brothers for the titles. The match was fought under &quot;Quebec Province Rules&quot; where the tag titles could change hands via disqualification. Jacques took advantage of this rule by tricking Scott Steiner into swinging a hockey stick as a foreign object and getting disqualified, causing the Quebecers to win the titles. In this same match, Polo debuted as the Quebecers&#x27; manager by coming to ringside during the match, sporting a Montreal Canadiens sweater.

Their feud with the Steiners continued, they were on opposite sides of the 1993 Survivor Series main event when they joined the &quot;Foreign Fanatics&quot; team with Ludvig Borga and Yokozuna against The Steiners, Lex Luger, and The Undertaker. However, Pierre was replaced by Crush in an injury storyline. The Steiner Brothers never managed to regain the titles from the Quebecers and soon the Quebecers started to defend against other teams.

Apart from the Steiners, the Quebecers focused on teams they deemed easily beatable, including jobbers like Barry Horowitz and Reno Riggins. Horowitz brought in the “1-2-3” Kid as his partner, leading to a series of title defenses against the Kid with changing partners. On January 10, 1994, the Kid and Marty Jannetty won an upset victory and won the gold. However, they lost the titles back to the Quebecers a week later. At the 1994 Royal Rumble, The Quebecers were the opponents during the match where Owen Hart turned on Bret Hart, but only served to bring the turn about, not as integral players in the developing storyline.

The Quebecers looked strong, defending the titles against all comers, including Men on a Mission, who were unsuccessful in their challenge at WrestleMania X, but managed to win the titles in London during a UK tour, albeit by accident as Pierre couldn&#x27;t get his shoulder up from under the massive Mabel. They regained the belts two days later in Sheffield. The Quebecers luck finally ran out when they came up against the recently face turned team of The Headshrinkers, who won the tag team titles from them on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; in Burlington, VT, which was the only time a title change occurred in Vermont, causing the team to argue after the match and then fight. After they lost to the Headshrinkers in Montreal; Jacques was attacked by Pierre, who blamed Jacques for costing them both the match and the titles. Their brief feud culminated in Jacques’ (first) retirement match at the Montreal Forum in 1994, which Jacques won.

In early 1995, Pierre was repackaged as a pirate named &quot;Jean-Pierre Lafitte.&quot; In early vignettes, Pierre would mention his previous gimmick as the Quebecer and explained that he changed his look and that Pierre&#x27;s full name was &quot;Jean-Pierre Lafitte&quot; and was a pirate the whole time. Pierre was released in December 1995.

===World Championship Wrestling===
Retirement did not last for Jacques Rougeau, as he returned to the ring in 1996 where he reunited with Pierre in World Championship Wrestling. The team had been renamed The Amazing French Canadians and Pierre had reverted to his real name, Carl Ouellet, to avoid trademark issues with the WWF. The duo retained their patriotic nature as they would enthusiastically wave flags of Canada and Quebec during their entrances, in addition to having the Canadian national anthem as their entrance theme. During that time period, they were managed by Col. Robert Parker, who dressed like a comical French Legionnaire and added a smattering of French words to his trademark southern drawl. They began feuding with Harlem Heat, as a result of tension between Parker and Harlem Heat&#x27;s manager, Sister Sherri. After Harlem Heat defeated the Amazing French Canadians at World War 3 on November 24, 1996, Sherri won the right to fight Parker for five minutes. Parker was beaten down by Sherri, but the rivals later reconciled and fell in love with one another.

The French Canadians participated in what turned out to be Arn Anderson&#x27;s last wrestling match before his retirement, losing to Anderson and Steve &quot;Mongo&quot; McMichael.

The Amazing French Canadians lost to their old rivals the Steiner Brothers at Clash of the Champions XXXIV on January 21, 1997.

===Return to the WWF and beyond===
In mid-1997, Jacques and Pierre were released from WCW and signed with the WWF, making their return in the early part of 1998. Gone were the Mountie uniforms, replaced by maple leaf adorned uniforms reminiscent of their run in WCW. The team was only used sporadically, primarily in losing effort at No Way Out 1998 against The Godwinns and as nondescript participants in the tag team battle royal at WrestleMania XIV before leaving the federation again. Their last match together was in a three-way in Montreal against Mark Henry and Godfather and The New Age Outlaws, which the Outlaws won, on August 2, 1998.

After leaving the WWF, Jacques and Pierre briefly appeared together in WCW as a part of Lance Storm’s Team Canada, but did not team up. Jacques opened up a wrestling school and runs a part-time promotion which both he and Pierre appear for on occasion. Jacques is semi-retired from the ring while Pierre wrestles mostly in Canada, mainly for the Montreal-based International Wrestling Syndicate and the Hull-based CPW International promotion, as Pierre Carl Ouellet.

<text>Chinatown ( or ) is a community in Southwest Houston, Texas, United States.

There is another Chinatown called &quot;Old Chinatown&quot; located within the East Downtown Houston district near the George R. Brown Convention Center.

==History==
The first businesses of the new Houston Chinatown opened in 1983. In the 1980s increasing numbers of Chinese were living in Southwest Houston and Fort Bend County and those residents were further away from the old Chinatown in what is now East Downtown. Diho Square (), home to a Diho Supermarket chain outlet, was built, followed by Dynasty Plaza () in 1986-1987, a complex developed by a Singaporean friend of Diho Supermarket operator Tsang Dat Wong; the latter invited the former to build in Houston. Developers at the time bought land, inexpensive due to the recession, in hopes of prosperous development later. From the 1980s until the 2000s, the census tracts housing sections of Chinatown saw decreasing income levels and real estate values.

The new Chinatown began to expand in the 1990s when Houston-area Asian American entrepreneurs moved their businesses from older neighborhoods, especially the &quot;Old Chinatown&quot; on the eastern end of Downtown Houston (in the process of redevelopment), in a search for more inexpensive properties and lower crime rates. Hong Kong City Mall (), owned by an ethnic Vietnamese man named Hai Du Duong, opened in 1999. In 2004 Nancy Sarnoff of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; described it as a westward shift for Chinatown.

In 2005 Christy Chang, a tour operator who operated tours into Chinatown, said, &quot;This area is not just Chinatown anymore. If anything, it&#x27;s Asia Town&quot; due to the presence of various ethnic groups that began establishing themselves in the community. The Asian American Business Council estimated that between 2004 and 2008 the land values along Bellaire Boulevard () in Chinatown increased between 25 and 50 percent. In 2008 the group estimated that in construction would appear within two years, including high-end condominiums. Lisa Gray of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote that the development of the remaining acreage would likely cause rents to increase and that, compared to many other Chinatowns in the United States, the Houston Chinatown is still relatively inexpensive.

In 2008 the Asian American Business Council placed a contest to design a &quot;landmark monument&quot; to be placed on Bellaire Boulevard between Beltway 8() and Gessner Road () in order to increase visibility among Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans and to beautify the area.

Xenophobia stoked during the COVID-19 pandemic caused a steep decline in customers, as malicious people spread rumors about Chinese-Americans in Houston.

==Cityscape==

The Southwest Management District (formerly Greater Sharpstown Management District) defines it as being roughly bounded by Redding Rd and Gessner Rd to the East, Westpark Dr to the North, Beltway 8 to the West, and Beechnut St to the South. The Greater Sharpstown Management District defines Chinatown within its borders as being a area.

According to the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau (GHCVB), &quot;Chinatown&quot; along with Little Saigon (just west of the neighborhood) combine to form a combined Asiatown. The combined border roughly bounded by Fondren Road, Beechnut Street, State Highway 6, and Westpark Drive, and lies between Alief and the city of Bellaire. The naming is disputed as other ethnic groups are within the expanded boundaries. Chinese businesses tend to be inside the Beltway while Vietnamese businesses tend to be outside of the Beltway.

The Bellaire Chinatown is about southwest of Downtown Houston. It is over , making it among the largest automobile-centric Chinatowns in the Southern United States. The Chinatown is located on a mostly treeless plain. The community is between Westchase and the City of Sugar Land. Katharine Shilcutt of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said that Chinatown was &quot;straddling Beltway 8 on the southwest side like an entire city unto itself.&quot; Sarnoff said that historically the intersection of Bellaire and Corporate Drive () served as the center of Chinatown, though that this was moving to the west by 2004.

Much of the land of Chinatown is owned by private entities, so there are relatively few public areas. The new Chinatown is located within a residential area of single-family houses and apartments, and its spread-out nature differs from the East Downtown Chinatown, which was in a relatively compact area. Many of the surrounding residential areas and office developments were built in the 1990s and 2000s.

The businesses within the new Chinatown include a mall, supermarkets, shopping centers, restaurants, and bakeries. The street signs have Chinese characters. Knapp and Vojnovic identified Hong Kong City Mall as the &quot;symbolic center&quot;, and &quot;visual center&quot;, as it houses the paifang (Chinese arch).

The Bellaire Chinatown has many &quot;retail condos&quot;, shopping centers in which spaces are owned instead of leased. Many East Asian people prefer to own shopping places instead of renting them. In the United States &quot;retail condos&quot; are rare outside areas populated by East Asian Americans. The community has restaurants serving many kinds of cuisines, including Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwanese, Filipino, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Malaysian, Thai, and Vietnamese. In addition it has restaurants operated by ethnic Vietnamese that serve Louisiana-style crawfish. The community also has many fusion cuisine restaurants. Shilcutt said that &quot;the restaurant density in this area is roughly equivalent to the population density of Vatican City.&quot;

Lisa Gray of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; stated that this Chinatown resembles newer Chinatowns that opened in automobile-oriented metropolitan areas in the United States such as suburbs in Greater Los Angeles and the Silicon Valley, as opposed to older, uniformly Chinese, pedestrian-oriented Chinatowns in New York City and San Francisco. Gray said that in older Chinatowns immigrant businesses cluster together by ethnic group, while in newer automobile oriented Chinatowns retail operations from different ethnic groups move in next door to each other.

==Demographics==
As of 2012, according to the Greater Sharpstown Management District the portion of Chinatown within the boundaries of the Greater Sharpstown district has 29,993 people. The clientele of this Chinatown tends to be middle class.

==Government and instrastructure==

Two Houston City Council districts, F and J, serve the new Chinatown. District J was created to allow Hispanics to more easily elect representatives who cater to them.

The new Chinatown is served by two Houston Police Department patrol divisions, the Midwest Patrol Division and the Westside Patrol Division, of the Houston Police Department. The Midwest division operates the Ranchester Storefront ( &quot;Chinatown Police Office&quot;) in the Diho Square complex.

Fire stations located within Chinatown&#x27;s boundaries include Station 10 Bellaire ( &quot;Fire Brigade #10&quot;) and Station 76 Alief Community, both a part of Fire District 83. Station 10, previously located in what is now East Downtown, moved to its current location in 1985. Station 76 was built in 1985.

==Economy==

Nearly a dozen banks, including overseas Chinese banks and mainstream banks, are located along a less-than- stretch of Bellaire Boulevard, near Beltway 8. The clientele of these banks include area residents and Asian American entrepreneurs. Robert Lee, an executive vice president of MetroBank, said, &quot;They call it the Wall Street of Chinatown.&quot;

In the three decades before 2007, Wells Fargo had one of the few bank branches in the area. Businesspeople began to open Asian American ethnic grocery stores and seafood markets. In the 1980s, Wells Fargo added signs in Chinese and hired tellers who spoke Cantonese, Korean, and nine other languages. During the same decade, local businesspeople opened MetroBank and Texas First National Bank during a banking crisis that hurt the state&#x27;s mainstream banks. George Lee, the president of MetroCorp Bancshares, said, &quot;All the banks were in trouble, and the ones that were not in trouble didn&#x27;t understand the needs of the Asian community.&quot; American First National Bank and Southwestern National Bank opened in the 1990s. As of 2007, many Asian businesses operate in the area, and so Asian American banks have opened to cater to them. As of that year Washington Mutual (now JPMorgan Chase) was the last company to open a bank branch in that area of Chinatown. Texas First National is now known as Golden Bank.

Southwestern National Bank has its headquarters in Chinatown and Greater Sharpstown. American First National Bank maintains a 12-story, $30 million headquarters building in Chinatown. MetroCorp Bancshares and subsidiary MetroBank previously had their headquarters in Chinatown and in Greater Sharpstown.

Halliburton previously operated the Houston Office (a.k.a. Oak Park Campus) on 67 acres of land in Chinatown and in the Westchase district. The complex included the Latin America division of Easywell, a division of Halliburton. The building first opened as a Brown and Root facility in 1979. In 2009 the Westchase campus had 1,700 employees; Halliburton plans to increase employment at Oak Park to 3,000. At the Bellaire site Halliburton plans to build a 16-story tower, a two-story &quot;life center,&quot; an additional parking garage, expanded child care facilities, auditoriums, and bridges to connect the many buildings. In 2009 Halliburton had about 1,000 employees in leased office space in Westchase. During that year Halliburton said that it planned to vacate the leased space. The plans for the Oak Park office had been delayed by one year, and Halliburton expected completion in 2013. However Halliburton closed it in 2015, and in 2020 a planned demolition was revealed.

==Education==
The new Chinatown is served by two school districts. Most of the New Chinatown according to the GHCVB definition is served by the Alief Independent School District, while an eastern portion is served by the Houston Independent School District. The HISD portion of the community is within Trustee District VI, represented by Greg Meyers as of 2008.

===Alief Independent School District===
Zoned elementary schools (K-4) located within the GHCVB definition of Chinatown include A. J. Bush, Chambers, Chancellor, Collins, Hearne, Liestman, Mahanay, Martin, and Youens. In addition Sneed Elementary School, outside Chinatown, serves a portion of Chinatown. Bilingual students zoned to Chancellor attend Youens, and bilingual students zoned to Mahanay attend Hearne.

Owens Middle School is a zoned intermediate school in Chinatown. Budewig, Miller, and Youngblood, outside Chinatown, serve portions of Chinatown. Middle schools in Chinatown include Alief Middle, Killough, and O&#x27;Donnell. A portion is served by Albright Middle, outside Chinatown.

Regardless of location within the district, all Alief ISD residents may be randomly assigned to either Alief Elsik High School, Alief Hastings High School, and Alief Taylor High School; all of them are in Chinatown. In addition the magnet school Alief Kerr High School is in Chinatown.

===Houston Independent School District===
Neff and White Elementary Schools are located in the Houston ISD portion of Chinatown. Other portions are served by Emerson and Piney Point elementary schools.

Most of the HISD portion is zoned to Sugar Grove Middle School and Sharpstown High School.

A portion of Chinatown is zoned to Revere Middle School and Wisdom High School (formerly Lee High School).

Prior to 2011, Sharpstown Middle School served most of the HISD portion of Chinatown. The portion of the HISD portion of New Chinatown south of Bellaire Boulevard was zoned to Sharpstown High School, while the portion north of Bellaire Boulevard was zoned to Lee High School (With Lamar High School and Westside High School as options). For a period after 2011 the Sharpstown zone was assigned to Sharpstown International School for grades 6 through 12.

===Private schools===
Strake Jesuit College Preparatory and Saint Agnes Academy are in Chinatown.

==Transportation==

Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County (METRO) provides local bus services to the area.

==Recreation==
Many Chinese holidays are celebrated in the Chinatown area with official events.

The Chinese Community Center (CCC, , &quot;Houston Chinese Culture Service Center&quot;), an IRS 501(c)(3) organization and a United Way affiliate, is located at 9800 Town Park Drive. The facility opened in 1979 as the Chinese Language School. The CCC has several levels of English classes offered daily. As of 2006, at CCC about 80% of the students have university degrees, and the other 20% are their family members.

There is a mural representing the pan-Asian cultures made by Thomas Tran, called the Asiatown Community Mural. The organization Houston in Action gave a grant to the Vietnamese Culture and Science Association (VCSA), which hired Tran. Over 200 people created the mural without payment, and the mural opened in 2022.

<doc id="377800" wikidata="Q7248091" url="?curid=377800" title="Professional qualifications in the United Kingdom">
<text>Professional qualifications in the United Kingdom are titles or awards granted by professional bodies. Many British professional qualifications were subject to the European directives on professional qualifications and are (following Brexit) covered by amended versions of those regulations as enacted in British law. Most, but not all, professional qualifications are &#x27;Chartered&#x27; qualifications, and follow on from having been admitted to a degree (or having an equivalent qualification). The term &quot;professional qualification&quot; can also be used to refer to higher-level vocational qualifications in &quot;professional&quot; roles.

==Regulation and levels==
There are four forms of regulated profession in the UK, with respect to the European directives on professional qualifications: professions regulated by law or public authority; professions regulated by professional bodies incorporated by royal charter; professions regulated under Regulation 35; and the seven sectoral professions with harmonised training requirements across the European Union. The European directives are given force of law in the UK via regulations issued by the Secretary of State under the European Communities Act 1972; the most recent regulations are &quot;The European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2015&quot;.

The Gatsby Charitable Foundation has been supporting the development of professional qualifications for technicians, such as the Science Council&#x27;s Registered Science Technician (RSciTech), the Engineering Council&#x27;s Engineering Technician (EngTech) and ICT Technician (ICTTech), and the British Computer Society&#x27;s Registered IT Technician (RITTech). Analysis by the Foundation identifies three levels of professional qualification on a &quot;registration ladder&quot; in science and engineering: technician registration, requiring Advanced Apprenticeships, A Levels, BTEC nationals, or similar awards at levels 3–4 on the Qualifications and Credit Framework (now replaced by the Regulated Qualifications Framework); intermediate qualifications such as Incorporated Engineer (IEng) and Registered Scientist (RSci) requiring Higher Apprenticeships, Higher National Diplomas, foundation degrees, bachelor&#x27;s degrees, or similar awards at levels 5–6; and chartered statuses such as CEng, CSci, CPhys, CChem, etc. that require master&#x27;s degrees or similar qualifications at level 7 or above.

The European directives specify five levels of professional qualification in the &quot;general system&quot;, labelled a to e and approximately defined by their required academic training as:
On this scale, ICTTech, EngTech and other technician qualifications equate to level c, IEng equates to level d, and CEng, CSci, etc. elite to level e. Although chartered statuses in science and engineering are placed at level e, in some fields chartered statuses, while remaining terminal professional qualifications in that field, are at level d (e.g. CMgr).

==Professional qualifications requiring an attestation of competence==

These professions are government regulated and involve reserved activities rather than a reserved title. Some of these are devolved matters that are not uniformly regulated across the UK. In most cases, the competent authority for these is a government department or agency.

==Professional qualifications requiring education at secondary level==

These professional qualifications are mostly, as in the previous category, government regulated with reserved activities, although some are through licensing of use of a reserved title.

Professions with reserved activities:
Professions with protected titles under a licensing system:
==Professional qualifications requiring education for at least one year at post-secondary level==
These qualifications now begin to include those which have protected titles without reserve of activities, normally granted by professional bodies under their royal charter rather than by statutory or regulatory bodies. Titles granted by professional bodies are often accompanied by postnominal letters.

===Regulated by law or public authority===

Professions with reserved activities or protected functions:
Professions with protected titles under a licensing system:
Professions with protected titles without reserve of activities:
===Regulated by professional bodies under royal charter===

Professions with protected titles without reserve of activities:
==Professional qualifications requiring bachelor&#x27;s degree level education==

Many of these are protected titles without reserve of activities, regulated by professional bodies acting under a royal charter. This includes a large number of chartered statuses, which are terminal professional qualifications in that field.

===Regulated by law or public authority===

Professions with reserved activities:
Professions with reserved activities and protected titles:

===Regulated by law or public authority===

Professions with reserved activities:
===Regulated by professional bodies under royal charter===

Professions with reserved activities:
Professions with protected titles without reserve of activities:
==Professional qualifications in sectoral professions==

The &quot;sectoral professions&quot; are ones which are regulated in every EU country and where training and education requirements have been harmonised. There is therefore no explicit training level associated with the qualifications in the regulations as the educational requirements do not vary between countries and do not need to be compared. All of these are regulated by law or public authority, not by professional bodies.

==Professional qualifications not included in the European directives==

Not all chartered titles are included in the European directives on professional qualifications, but all UK chartered titles, and some lower-level titles, are issued by a professional body under the authority of a royal charter and are thus recognised professional qualifications (these should not be confused with membership levels within an organisation). These qualifications are sometimes associated with professions that are included in the directives as regulated under law or by public authority (e.g. architecture or psychology).

Non-chartered titles:

<doc id="377803" wikidata="Q229493" url="?curid=377803" title="Nino Burjanadze">
<text>Nino Burjanadze (; ; born 16 July 1964) is a Georgian politician and lawyer who served as Chairperson of the Parliament of Georgia from November 2001 to June 2008. As the first woman, she has served as the acting head of state of Georgia twice; the first time from 23 November 2003 to 25 January 2004 in the wake of Eduard Shevardnadze&#x27;s resignation during the Rose Revolution, and again from 25 November 2007 to 20 January 2008, when Mikheil Saakashvili stepped down to rerun in the early presidential elections. She withdrew into opposition to Saakashvili as the leader of the Democratic Movement-United Georgia party in 2008. In October 2013, she ran in the presidential election, competing against 22 candidates. She ended third with 10 percent of the vote.

== Early life and career ==
Nino Burjanadze was born in Kutaisi, then-Soviet Georgia. She graduated in 1986 from the Faculty of Law of the Tbilisi State University (TSU). Afterwards, she pursued education at Moscow State University from which she graduated with a doctorate in International Law in 1990. In 1991, she became a docent (Associate Professor) of the Faculty of International Law at Tbilisi State University. At the same time, she worked as an expert consultant in international law for the Parliament of Georgia and the Ministry for Environment Protection and Natural Resources.

== Political career ==
In 1995, Burjanadze was elected to the Parliament of Georgia for the Union of Citizens of Georgia (UCG) then chaired by the President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze and supported financially by her father Anzor Burjanadze, a wealthy businessman. She first chaired the Parliamentary Committee for Constitutional Law from 1998 to 1999, and the Parliamentary Committee for International Relations from 2000 to 2001. During these years, she became known as a supporter of pro-Western values and a proponent of Georgia&#x27;s integration with NATO and the European Union. She was closely allied with the reformist wing within the UCG led by Mikheil Saakashvili and Zurab Zhvania whom she succeeded on 9 November as parliamentary chairperson after Zhvania resigned on 1 November 2001.

Although she gave Shevardnadze strong support in his dealings with foreign countries (particularly with Russia), she spoke out forcefully against the corruption and inefficiency of his government&#x27;s domestic policy, declaring it &quot;absolutely incompetent.&quot; She left the UCG in 2002, forming an opposition party called the &quot;Burjanadze-Democrats&quot; to fight the November 2003 parliamentary elections.

After the rigged parliamentary elections of 2 November 2003, she joined other opposition leaders in denouncing the election results and urging mass demonstrations against Shevardnadze. The terms of the Georgian constitution automatically made her the acting president when Shevardnadze resigned on 23 November. This became known as the Rose Revolution. One of Burjanadze&#x27;s first actions was to appeal for national unity and repeal the state of emergency declared by Shevardnadze, in an effort to restore stability to a country with a long history of political violence. She was an obvious candidate for the post, as she is widely respected by her compatriots - opinion polling in 2003 showed her to be one of Georgia&#x27;s three most popular political figures.

On 4 January 2004, Mikhail Saakashvili won the pre-term presidential elections with an overwhelming majority. He was inaugurated on 25 January. A new parliament was elected on 28 March, with Burjanadze resuming her old post as Speaker on 22 April.

Following a political crisis in late 2007, Saakashvili called for new parliamentary and presidential elections for January 2008. In order to contest the presidential election, Saakashvili announced his resignation effective 25 November 2007, with Burjanadze becoming acting president for a second time (until the election returned Saakashvili to office on 20 January 2008).

Burjanadze was designated to lead the United National Movement party list for the parliamentary elections scheduled on 21 May 2008, but on 21 April she announced, in a surprise move, that she would not seek reelection due to a lack of consensus in the compilation of the National Movement&#x27;s party list. Burjanadze&#x27;s term as a parliamentary chairperson expired with the new legislature&#x27;s inaugural session on 7 June 2008, when she was succeeded by David Bakradze.

In June 2008, Burjanadze announced she would set up a think tank that would serve as &quot;a new form of being in politics.&quot; The organization — the Foundation for Democracy and Development (FDD) — was inaugurated in Tbilisi on 7 July 2008.

On 27 October 2008, in the aftermath of the 2008 South Ossetia war between Russia and Georgia, Burjanadze announced the establishment of &quot;a clear-cut opposition party&quot; called Democratic Movement–United Georgia.

On 28 November 2008, in an interview with Russia&#x27;s Vesti news channel, Russia&#x27;s NATO envoy Dmitry Rogozin accused the United States of planning to replace Saakashvili with Burjanadze as president of Georgia.

On 23 March 23, 2009, the Georgian interior ministry confirmed, that 10 of the activists from Burjanadze&#x27;s party, Democratic Movement–United Georgia had been arrested. Burjanadze accused Saakashvili of arranging the arrests to intimidate the opposition. Burjanadze said the arrests marked the start of a &quot;punitive campaign&quot; by the government against the opposition, ahead of the mass protest planned for 9 April to demand Saakashvili&#x27;s resignation.

=== 2011 protests===
The protests led by Burjanadze began on 21 May 21, 2011 when over 10,000 Georgians attended a demonstration in Tbilisi demanding Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili&#x27;s resignation. In the southwestern town of Batumi some demonstrations also occurred with some protesters attempting to break into the television building. Nino Burjanadze has been a lead figure in the demonstrations. The protesters in Batumi briefly clashed with police. On 26 May at about 00:15, Georgian police began to suppress the protests with tear gas and rubber bullets. The following year, the ruling party lost parliamentary elections.

==Political positions==
*Burjanadze&#x27;s position, as it relates to, Soviet symbols is that they should not be banned as Georgian soldiers in the Red Army fought under Soviet symbols during World War II. In 2018, she said, &quot;Half the world fought against the Nazis with Soviet symbols. Instead of banning them, the state should concentrate on today’s problems and stop acting like fools.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Burjanadze is married to Badri Bitsadze, the former head of the Department of Georgian State Border Defence, who stood down shortly after Burjanadze&#x27;s political transformation. They have two sons. Aside from the Georgian language, she is fluent in Russian and English.

== Geography ==

Diyala Governorate extends to the northeast of Baghdad as far as the Iranian border. Its capital is Baqubah. It covers an area of 17,685 square kilometres (6,828 sq mi).

A large portion of the province is drained by the Diyala River, a major tributary of the Tigris. Because of its proximity to two major sources of water, Diyala&#x27;s main industry is agriculture, primarily dates grown in large groves. The province also contains one of the largest olive groves in the Middle East. It is also recognized as the orange capital of the Middle East. The Hamrin Mountains pass through the governorate.

== Population ==
The governorate is home to a diverse population of Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen. According to the latest statistics, the number of inhabitants is approximately 1,6 million.
==Culture==

===Sports===
Diyala is home to Diyala SC that plays in Iraq Stars League, the highest division of the Iraqi football league system, following promotion from Iraqi Premier Division League in 2024. The club is based in Baqubah and Ba&#x27;quba Stadium is its home stadium.

The Diyala Media Center was built under contract by a Japanese architectural firm in 1989. It is one of Iraq&#x27;s few independent radio and television stations that offer local television and radio news coverage as well as rebroadcasting state-run television.

== Civil unrest/Iraq War ==
There is evidence that Al-Qaeda in Iraq moved its base of operations from Anbar province to Diyala in 2006 and during late 2006, Baqubah and majority of the Diyala province were reported to have come under Sunni insurgent control.
This insurgent control is reported to have continued through 2007 and into early 2008.

On May 11, 2007, Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon, commander of the Multi-National Division North said he needed more troops in order to contain the current level of violence in the Diyala province, this coming in the recent wake of a troop &quot;surge&quot;, involuntary recalls by the U.S. military, and the public debate about the level of commitment from the U.S. government.
By mid-2007 the Islamic State of Iraq, already holding Baqubah and most of the province under its control, declared its capital to be Baqubah. The Sunni insurgent group Ansar al-Islam was also active in the region around this time.

In June 2007, US forces launched Operation Arrowhead Ripper with night air assaults in Baqubah. By August 19, Baqubah was largely secured, although some insurgent presence remained in the city and surrounding areas. Fighting continued in the Diyala River valley but by the beginning of October, US and Iraqi forces held most of the province while the insurgents were in retreat to the north and west. On October 27 the Islamic State of Iraq attacked a police base in Baqubah, killing 28 Iraqi policemen and police recruits, showing that insurgent cells still remain in the province.

In January 2008 Operation Phantom Phoenix was launched in an attempt to eradicate the remaining insurgents following the Diyala campaign between 2006 and 2007.

Mid-2008 saw many changes in Diyala province with an increased effort by U.S. Forces and a substantial Iraqi Army presence, and in the Baqubah region, Islamic State of Iraq&#x27;s activity was dramatically hampered, and the Sons of Iraq program served only to further weaken Islamic State in Iraq.

===Declaration of autonomy===
In December 2011, the governing council in Diyala province declared itself a semi-autonomous region within Iraq. This comes two months after Saladin Governorate made a similar declaration. The council in Diyala, using Article 119 of the Iraqi Constitution as justification, made the declaration because of suspicion of the Shi&#x27;a-dominated government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Unlike Salah ad Din province however, Diyala province is more ethnically and religiously mixed, and such an announcement led to the outbreak of protests in the province.

<doc id="377807" wikidata="Q2597961" url="?curid=377807" title="East Baltic race">
<text>The East Baltic race is one of the subcategories of the Europid race, into which it was divided by scientific racism in the early 20th century. Such racial typologies have been rejected by modern anthropology for several reasons.

The term East Baltic race was coined by anthropologist Rolf Nordenstreng, but was popularised by race theorist Hans F. K. Günther. This race was said to live in Finland, Estonia and northern Russia, and was also said to be found among the Slavic, Baltic, Uralic and even Germanic speakers (mainly due to Prussian and Swedish locals who migrated to the region throughout medieval and early modern times) of the Baltic sea area. It was characterised as &quot;short-headed, broad-faced, with heavy, massive under-jaw, chin not prominent, flat, rather broad, short nose with low bridge; stiff, light (ash-blond) hair; light (grey or pale blue) eyes, standing out; light skin with a greyish undertone.

The American Eugenics Society described East Baltic people as being Mongolized.

Nazi philologist Josef Nadler declared the East Baltic race to be the main source of German Romanticism. Also in the Third Reich, philologist Julius Petersen wrote that Ludwig Tieck&#x27;s Romanticism might have been promoted by his possible Slavic heritage, referring to American biographer Edwin H. Zeydel&#x27;s theory that Tieck&#x27;s grandmother was Russian.

<text>The Richat Structure, or Guelb er Richât (, ), is a prominent circular geological feature in the Adrar Plateau of the Sahara. It is located near Ouadane in the Adrar Region of Mauritania. In Hassaniya Arabic, &quot;rīšāt&quot; means &quot;feathers&quot; and it is also known locally in Arabic as &quot;tagense&quot;, referring to the circular opening of the leather pouch that is used to draw water from local wells.

It is an eroded geological dome, in diameter caused by a subsurface igneous intrusion deforming the overlying sedimentary rock layers, causing the rock to be exposed as concentric rings with the oldest layers exposed at the centre of the structure. Igneous rock is exposed inside and there are rhyolites and gabbros that have undergone hydrothermal alteration, and a central megabreccia. The structure is also the location of exceptional accumulations of Acheulean Paleolithic stone tools. It was selected as one of the 100 geological heritage sites identified by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) to be of the highest scientific value.

==Description==

The Richat Structure is a deeply eroded, slightly elliptical dome with a diameter of . The sedimentary rock exposed in this dome ranges in age from Late Proterozoic within the center of the dome to Ordovician sandstone around its edges. The sedimentary rocks composing this structure dip outward at 10–20°. Differential erosion of resistant layers of quartzite has created high-relief circular cuestas. Its center consists of a siliceous breccia covering an area that is at least in diameter.Exposed within the interior of the Richat Structure is a variety of intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks. They include rhyolitic volcanic rocks, gabbros, carbonatites and kimberlites. The rhyolitic rocks consist of lava flows and hydrothermally altered tuffaceous rocks that are part of two distinct eruptive centers, which are interpreted to be the eroded remains of two maars. According to field mapping, aeromagnetic, and gravimetric data, the gabbroic rocks form two concentric ring dikes. The inner ring dike is about in width, from the center of the Richat Structure. The outer ring dike is about in width, from the center of the structure. Thirty-two carbonatite dikes and sills have been mapped within the structure. The dikes are generally about long and typically wide. They consist of massive carbonatites that are mostly devoid of vesicles. The carbonatite rocks have been dated as having cooled between 94 and 104 million years ago. A kimberlitic plug and several sills have been found within the northern part of the structure. The kimberlite plug has been dated to around 99 million years old. These intrusive igneous rocks are interpreted as indicating the presence of a large alkaline igneous intrusion that currently underlies the structure and was created by uplifting the overlying rock.

Spectacular hydrothermal features are a part of the Richat Structure. They include the extensive hydrothermal alteration of rhyolites and gabbros and a central megabreccia created by hydrothermal dissolution and collapse. The siliceous megabreccia is at least thick in its center to only a few meters thick along its edges. The breccia consists of fragments of white to dark gray cherty material, quartz-rich sandstone, diagenetic cherty nodules, and stromatolitic limestone and is intensively silicified. The hydrothermal alteration, which created this breccia, has been dated to have occurred about 98.2 ± 2.6 million years ago using the 40Ar/39Ar method.

==Interpretation==
The structure was first described in the 1930s to 1940s, as &quot;Richât Crater&quot; or &quot;Richât buttonhole&quot; (&quot;boutonnière du Richât&quot;). Richard-Molard (1948) considered it to be the result of a laccolithic uplift. A geological expedition to Mauritania led by Théodore Monod in 1952 recorded four &quot;crateriform or circular irregularities&quot; (&quot;accidents cratériformes ou circulaires&quot;) in the area, &quot;Er Richât&quot;, &quot;Aouelloul&quot; (south of Chinguetti), &quot;Temimichat-Ghallaman&quot; and &quot;Tenoumer&quot;. It was initially considered to be an impact structure (as is clearly the case with the other three), but a closer study in the 1950s to 1960s suggested that it might instead have been formed by terrestrial processes. After field and laboratory studies in the 1960s, no significant evidence was found for shock metamorphism or other deformation indicative of a hypervelocity extraterrestrial impact. Coesite, an indicator of shock metamorphism, was initially reported as being present in rock samples from the structure, but a further analysis in 1969 concluded that barite had been misidentified as coesite. Work on dating the structure was done in the 1990s. A study of the formation of the structure by Matton, et al. (2005, 2008) concluded it was not an impact structure.

Further analysis of deep structure underneath the surface, including with aeromagnetic and gravimetric mapping, concluded that the structure is the result of ring faults which led to gabbroic ring dikes over a large intrusive body of magma, and the uplifting and later erosion of a dome, through intense hydrothermal activity through the fractured substructure. This can form cuestas over time through the differential erosion of the resulting alternating hard and soft rock layers. The underlying alkaline igneous complex exposed through erosion dates to the Cretaceous period.

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of it being &quot;a spectacular example of a magmatic concentric alkaline complex&quot;, the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included the Richat Structure in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world, in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &quot;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history.&quot;

== Archaeology ==

The Richat Structure is the location of exceptional accumulations of Acheulean artifacts. These Acheulean archaeological sites are located along wadis that occupy the outermost annular depression of this structure. Pre-Acheulean stone tools also have been found in the same areas. These sites are associated with rubbly outcrops of quartzite that provided the raw material needed for the manufacture of these artifacts. The most important Acheulean sites and their associated outcrops are found along the northwest of the outer ring, from which Wadi Akerdil heads east and Wadi Bamouere to the west. Sparse and widely scattered Neolithic spear points and other artifacts have also been found. However, since these sites were first discovered by Théodore Monod in 1974, mapping of artifacts within the area of the structure have found them to be generally absent in its innermost depressions. So far, neither recognizable midden deposits nor manmade structures have been recognized and reported from the structure. This is interpreted as indicating that the area of the Richat Structure was used for only short-term hunting and stone tool manufacturing. The local apparent wealth of surface artifacts is the result of the concentration and mixing by deflation over multiple glacial-interglacial cycles.

Artifacts are found, typically redeposited, deflated, or both, in Late Pleistocene to early Holocene gravelly mud, muddy gravel, clayey sand, and silty sand. These sediments are often cemented into either concretionary masses or beds by calcrete. Ridges typically consist of deeply weathered bedrock representing truncated Cenozoic paleosols that formed under tropical environments. The Pleistocene to Middle Holocene sediments occur along wadis as the thin, meter- to less-than-meter-thick accumulations in the interior annular depressions to -thick accumulations along the wadis in the outermost annular depression of the structure. The gravelly deposits consist of a mixture of slope scree, debris flow, and fluviatile or even torrential flow deposits. The finer-grained, sandy deposits consist of eolian and playa lake deposits. The latter contain well-preserved freshwater fossils. Numerous concordant radiocarbon dates indicate that the bulk of these sediments accumulated between 15,000 and 8,000 BP during the African humid period. These deposits lie directly upon deeply eroded and weathered bedrock.

== Fringe theory of Atlantis site ==
The Richat structure has been the subject of fringe claims to be the site of Atlantis mentioned in the works of Plato. This claim is primarily based on the concentric nature of the structure, which superficially matches Plato&#x27;s description of the city. Most classicists believe that Atlantis was a fictional rhetorical invention by Plato, rather than a real geographic location. Skeptic Steven Novella criticised the claim, stating that the structure is inconsistent with Plato&#x27;s description of Atlantis, and that the site shows no evidence of a city ever being built at the location.

<text>Ledbury is a market town and civil parish in the county of Herefordshire, England, lying east of Hereford, and west of the Malvern Hills.

It has a significant number of Tudor style timber-framed structures, in particular along Church Lane and High Street. One of the most outstanding is Ledbury Market Hall, built in 1617, located in the town centre. Other notable buildings include the parish church of St. Michael and All Angels, the Painted Room (containing sixteenth-century frescoes), the Old Grammar School, the Barrett-Browning memorial clock tower (designed by Brightwen Binyon and opened in 1896 to house the library until 2015), nearby Eastnor Castle and the St. Katherine&#x27;s Hospital site. Founded , this is a rare surviving example of a hospital complex, with hall, chapel, a Master&#x27;s House (fully restored and opened in March 2015 to house the Library), almshouses and a timber-framed barn.

==History==
Ledbury is a borough whose origins date to around AD 690. In the Domesday Book it was recorded as Liedeberge. It may take its name from the River Leadon on which it stands. Old English &quot;burg&quot; (fortified or defended site) has been added to the river name.

As a town it was created on a bishop&#x27;s manor, probably, like Leominster, Bromyard and Ross-on-Wye, in the episcopate of Bishop Richard de Capella (1121–1127). It returned members to Parliament in the reign of Edward I. The &quot;Feathers Hotel&quot; was a famous 16th century drovers&#x27; inn. It was not until the reign of Queen Elizabeth I that this &#x27;poor town&#x27; became prosperous thanks mainly to three families of clothier merchants, Skynner, Skyppe, and Elton. No less than four battles were fought during the English civil wars, during which it was a bastion of royalism. Thereafter the arrival of the Martin and Biddulph during the age of aristocracy and into the Victorian signalled a financial sea-change for the town from these banker landowners; Biddulph was later ennobled.

In April 1645, during the English Civil War, a battle was fought at Ledbury between Royalist forces under Prince Rupert and Roundhead forces under Col Edward Massey, a veteran parliamentarian leader during the Siege of Gloucester. As Prince Rupert’s forces advanced north, towards Leicester, Massey’s forces barricaded the town, but were subsequently routed from Ledbury and pursued for many miles, losing 520 men. It was one of the last royalist victories of the First Civil War, Rupert’s army would later be comprehensively defeated at the Battle of Naseby.

Lord Biddulph lived in the Regency mansion Underdown, built in Ledbury Park by Anthony Keck in about 1780.

Ledbury was home to poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who spent her childhood at Hope End. It is also the birthplace of poet laureate John Masefield, after whom the local secondary school is named. William Wordsworth&#x27;s 1835 sonnet &quot;St. Catherine of Ledbury&quot;, concerning a local anchoress called Katherine, begins &quot;When ... Ledbury bells broke forth in concert&quot;. In 1901 St. Katharine&#x27;s priest was Charles Madison Green, whose wife, Ella, was the eldest sister of author H. Rider Haggard. During the twentieth century the population stabilised, hardly growing at all to the Census of 1971. Becoming a prosperous town of small and independent traders, it relied heavily on agricultural industries. With the addition of the by-pass in 1989, the population rapidly expanded to nearly 10,000 in Census 2011.

The Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal, which opened from Gloucester as far as Ledbury in 1798, passed through the lower part of the town with wharves at Bye Street and at what is now the Ross Road near the Full Pitcher public house. After closing in 1885, part of the Ledbury-to-Gloucester section of the canal was used by the Great Western Railway for the Ledbury and Gloucester Railway. The original line of the canal northwards towards Hereford can still be seen, where it went underneath the Ledbury-to-Hereford railway. When the Gloucester railway closed in 1964 as a result of the Beeching cuts it became overgrown, but the route through Ledbury became a footpath. In 1997 a section from the bypass/Ross Road roundabout to the railway station was upgraded to a wide path with a surface of compacted limestone chippings that could be utilised by cyclists and wheelchair users. Several access points were created, trees thinned out but retained, and the Hereford Road Skew Bridge across the A438 was reopened. The proposed bridge to take the Town Trail (as it is now known) across the B4214 Bromyard Road into the station yard was not built. The Trail ends at the Hereford/Bromyard road junction.

Ledbury Town Halt railway station opened in 1885 and closed in 1959.

==Governance==
Ledbury forms part of three electoral wards of Herefordshire Council. It has a town council, a town clerk, a mayor and a town crier. The town crier, Bill Turberfield (locally known as &#x27;Bill the Bell&#x27;) opens events such as the annual Christmas Lights Switch-On. The mayor is Helen I&#x27;Anson. Ledbury is one of four market towns (the others being Leominster, Bromyard and Kington) in the North Herefordshire parliamentary constituency. Prior to 2010, it was part of the predecessor constituency, Leominster. Conservative Bill Wiggin was the local MP from 2001, until 2024.

==Transport==
The main roads through the town are the A449 and the A417; the M50 motorway runs to the south.

Ledbury railway station is near to the western end of the Cotswold line and offers direct services to Hereford, Worcester, Birmingham, Oxford and London Paddington. Services are operated by Great Western Railway.

Bus services are operated primarily by First Worcester and DRM Bus; routes connect the town with Hereford, Ross-on-Wye and Worcester.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Ridge Hill TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Hereford and Worcester, Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire, Greatest Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire and Sunshine Radio. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Ledbury Reporter&quot; which publishes on Fridays.

==Industry==
For many years the Robertson&#x27;s factory, a subsidiary of Rank Hovis McDougall, produced jam. Production was moved to Histon in Cambridgeshire in September 2007 following the parent company&#x27;s acquisition by Premier Foods. The site is now used by Universal Beverages to process fruit for cider producers such as Bulmer&#x27;s and includes two giant fermentation tanks, each capable of holding 800,000 litres.

Ledbury is home to Amcor&#x27;s flexible-packaging manufacturing plant. This has been awarded both the &#x27;Carbon Reduction Cost-Saving Award - over 250 employees&#x27; and &#x27;Most Promising New Low-Carbon Product / Service Award - over 250 employees&#x27; in the West Midlands Low-Carbon-Economy 2010 awards.

Ledbury has an income from tourism, being steeped in history in a rural area, with pubs for visitors and locals alike.

==Recreation==
The town is the venue for various events including the Ledbury Poetry Festival. The annual Community Day takes place in June each year. The first such event was an Ox Roast on 2 June 2013 to commemorate the diamond jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation, exactly 60 years after an ox roast that was held in 1953 in Ledbury on Coronation Day.

The Big Chill at nearby Eastnor Castle, which brought thousands of people to the area each year closed after the August 2011 event. Eastnor Castle has provided the backdrop to a number of films, including 1970&#x27;s &quot;One More Time&quot;, starring Jerry Lewis and Sammy Davis Jr. BBC television filmed some scenes for &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; starring Nicholas Lyndhurst in 1976.

The Market Theatre, reputed to be the first in the world to open in the new millennium, is situated near the town centre. It has been built on the site of the former Church Room (a typical &#x27;tin tabernacle&#x27; constructed in 1910, which became a theatre in 1956, with a change of name to the Market Theatre in the 1970s). From 1963 (following the demolition of the Kemble Theatre in Hereford, which was named after theatre manager Roger Kemble) until 1979, this little building was the only theatre in Herefordshire.
 Ledbury Amateur Dramatic Society (LADS) runs the Theatre, mounting several of its own productions a year. They show films and live screenings on a regular basis, and play host to small and mid-scale professional touring shows, including events in the Poetry Festival. There are a number of singing groups, including the Choral Society and the Community Choir the latter with over 60 members.
In 2000, Ledbury formed a twinning association with the Swedish[28] town of Strömstad. Since then, several cultural and sporting exchanges have taken place between the two: the junior football club, Ledbury Swifts makes an annual trip there.
The hunts (Ledbury, which dates from 1846, and North Ledbury,
established in 1905) used to be well supported. The Hunting with Dogs Act 2004 banned the country pursuit, which angered local people, a few of whom joined the Countryside Alliance to register their protest.
The town is home to the Silurian Border Morrismen.

==Folklore==
At Tedstone Delamere the Sapey Brook runs its course to Upper Sapey. A story is told of a stolen mare and colt whose hoofprints stopped at the bank of the brook. The owner was Saint Catherine of Ledbury who prayed for their safe return and, upon examining the bed of the brook, saw hoofprints clearly visible in the rocky bottom. These were followed and the thief caught, the horses being safely recovered. A local pastime was once the creation of fake hoofprints for visitors; the original petrosomatoglyphs are visible in the brook to this day, attributed by experts to archaeology.

<text>Lostwithiel (; ) is a civil parish and small town in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom at the head of the estuary of the River Fowey. According to the 2001 census it had a population of 2,739, increasing to 2,899 at the 2011 census. The Lostwithiel electoral ward had a population of 4,639 at the 2011 census. The name Lostwithiel comes from the Cornish &quot;lostwydhyel&quot; which means &quot;tail of a wooded area&quot;.

==Origin of the name==
The origin of the name Lostwithiel is a subject much debated. In the 16th century it was thought that the name came from the Roman name &quot;Uzella&quot;, translated as &quot;Les Uchel&quot; in Cornish. In the 17th century popular opinion was that the name came from a translation of &quot;Lost&quot; (a tail) and &quot;Withiel&quot; (a lion), the lion in question being the lord who lived in the castle.

Current thinking is that the name comes from the Old Cornish &quot;Lost Gwydhyel&quot; meaning &quot;tail-end of the woodland&quot;. The view from Restormel Castle looking towards the town shows how this may have come to be.

==History==
Lostwithiel was founded in the early 12th century by Norman lords who built the nearby Restormel Castle. Lostwithiel received its town charter in 1189. In the late 13th century, Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall oversaw the building of the Stannary Palace, the bridge and the square church tower.

The Battle of Lostwithiel, an important battle in the First English Civil War, took place near Lostwithiel in 1644. In it Parliamentarian forces were defeated by the Royalists. The Parliamentarians would go on to win the war but Cornwall remained under Royalist control until 1646.

The Lostwithiel constituency elected two members to the Unreformed House of Commons, but was disenfranchised by the Reform Act 1832. It remained a municipal borough until the 1960s, when it became a civil parish. The seal of the borough of Lostwithiel was a shield charged with a castle rising from water between two thistles, in the water two fish, with the legend &quot;Sigillum burgi de Lostwithyel et Penknight in Cornubia&quot;. Its mayoral regalia includes a silver oar, signifying its former jurisdiction over the River Fowey.

Jaques Bagratuni, a prince and ambassador of Armenia to Britain, died in Lostwithiel on 23 December 1943 but was buried at Brompton Cemetery in London.

==Geography==
The town is situated in the Fowey river valley, positioned between the A390 road from Tavistock to Truro and the upper tidal reaches of the river.

Lostwithiel railway station is on the Cornish Main Line from Plymouth to Penzance. It is situated on the south side of the town, just across the medieval bridge. The line was originally built for the Cornwall Railway which built its main workshops here, but the surviving workshop buildings were transformed into apartments in 2004. A branch line takes china clay trains to Fowey.

The town contains the suburbs of Bridgend to the east and Rosehill and Victoria to the west of the River Fowey.

To the south of the town is the Shirehall Moor nature reserve which follows the course of the River Fowey and opens out to a wide salt marsh. The reserve is a haven for birdlife including swans, ducks, egrets, herons, kingfishers and Canada geese.
==Buildings==
Lostwithiel&#x27;s most notable buildings are St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church and Restormel Castle. Once a stannary town, and for a period the most important in Cornwall, it is now much reduced in importance. There is a fine early fourteenth-century bridge with six pointed arches, and nearby the remains of the Stannary Palace, with its exchequer hall. Lostwithiel Guildhall in Fore Street has an arcaded ground floor and contains the local museum.
==Culture==
The town has a playing field known as King George V Playing Field. Lostwithiel has several large parks including Coulson Park which was named after Nathaniel Coulson (the San Francisco property magnate) who was raised in Lostwithiel after being abandoned by his father.

The town is host to a number of annual cultural activities including an arts and crafts festival, a beer festival, a week-long carnival in the summer, food and cider festivals in October, and a Dickensian evening in December.

==Sport==
Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, have been held in Lostwithiel for centuries. Venues have included the grounds of Lanwithan, Coulson Park and the King George V Playing Field.

Lostwithiel hosted the Interceltic Games in 1982.

==Education==
There are two primary schools in Lostwithiel: St Winnow C E School and Lostwithiel Primary School. Both schools are academies. Lostwithiel Primary School is part of the Peninsula Learning Trust Multi Academy Trust and St Winnow C E School is part of The Saints Way Multi Academy Trust. The majority of children aged between 11 and 16 attend Fowey River Academy or Bodmin College.

Lostwithiel Educational Trust is a local charity which makes &quot;grants to local schools and churches, as well as to individuals, for educational purposes&quot;

==Transport==
One or two trains each hour stop at Lostwithiel railway station with services in each direction between or , many continuing beyond Plymouth to or .

National Express provides a regular coach service to London which runs via Plymouth for connections to other destinations. The coach stop is located outside the Royal Talbot Hotel.

Bus stops in Lostwithiel are outside the Royal Talbot Hotel and Cott Road phone box.

==Twinning==
Lostwithiel was twinned with Pleyber-Christ in Brittany, France in 1979. The people in the Twinning Associations of both towns usually meet up every year, alternating between Lostwithiel and Pleyber-Christ.

<text>Pagliacci (; literal translation, &#x27;Clowns&#x27;) is an Italian opera in a prologue and two acts, with music and libretto by Ruggero Leoncavallo. The opera tells the tale of Canio, actor and leader of a commedia dell&#x27;arte theatrical company, who murders his wife Nedda and her lover Silvio on stage during a performance. &quot;Pagliacci&quot; premiered at the Teatro Dal Verme in Milan on 21 May 1892, conducted by Arturo Toscanini, with Adelina Stehle as Nedda, Fiorello Giraud as Canio, Victor Maurel as Tonio, and Mario Ancona as Silvio. Soon after its Italian premiere, the opera played in London (with Nellie Melba as Nedda) and in New York (on 15 June 1893, with Agostino Montegriffo as Canio). &quot;Pagliacci&quot; is the best-known of Leoncavallo&#x27;s ten operas and remains a staple of the repertoire.

&quot;Pagliacci&quot; is often staged with &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; by Pietro Mascagni, a double bill known colloquially as &quot;Cav/Pag&quot;.

==Origin and disputes==
Leoncavallo was a little-known composer when Pietro Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; premiered around 1890. After seeing Mascagni&#x27;s success, Leoncavallo decided to write an opera in response: one act composed in the verismo style.

Leoncavallo based the story of &quot;Pagliacci&quot; on an incident from his childhood: the 1865 murder of a Leoncavallo family servant, Gaetano Scavello, killed by Gaetano D&#x27;Alessandro, with brother Luigi acting as accomplice. The incident stemmed from a series of perceived romantic entanglements involving Scavello, Luigi D&#x27;Alessandro, and a village girl with whom both men were infatuated. Leoncavallo&#x27;s father, a judge, presided as magistrate over the criminal investigation.

Leoncavallo originally titled his story &quot;Il pagliaccio&quot; (&quot;The Clown&quot;). The baritone Victor Maurel, who was cast as the first Tonio, requested that Leoncavallo change the title from the singular &quot;Il pagliaccio&quot; to the plural &quot;I Pagliacci&quot;, to broaden dramatic interest from Canio alone to include Tonio (his own role).

The French author Catulle Mendès sued Leoncavallo for plagiarism after learning of the plot of Leoncavallo&#x27;s libretto from an 1894 French translation. Mendès thought it resembled his 1887 play &quot;La Femme de Tabarin&quot; (&quot;Tabarin&#x27;s Wife&quot;), which was structured as a play-within-the-play and featured a clown murdering his wife. Leoncavallo pleaded ignorance of Mendès&#x27;s play. Later, there were counter-accusations that Mendès&#x27;s play resembled Don Manuel Tamayo y Baus&#x27;s &quot;Un Drama Nuevo&quot; (1867). Mendès dropped his lawsuit. Scholar Matteo Sansone has suggested that Leoncavallo had ample opportunity to be exposed to new French art and musical works while living in Paris from 1882 to 1888, including potentially Mendès&#x27;s play, another version of &quot;La femme de Tabarin&quot; by Paul Ferrier, and &quot;Tabarin&quot;, an opera composed by Émile Pessard that was based on Ferrier&#x27;s play.

==Composition==
The opening Prologue was written for Victor Maurel &quot;as an afterthought&quot;, as Leoncavallo said in a conversation with the critic and singing teacher Herman Klein during his visit to London for the UK premiere in 1893: he wrote it &quot;as an inducement to a clever, but rather egotistical baritone to sing the part of Tonio, who felt it wasn&#x27;t important enough for an artist of his distinction. Perhaps he was right. Anyhow I thought the matter over and hit upon the idea that a prologue, sung before the curtain by one of the humblest characters, would prove something of a novelty and by no means out of place. Being, as you know, my own librettist, I quickly wrote the words and sketched the music. My baritone was delighted, both with the notion and the result, and I am bound to add that it proved one of the most striking features of the opera when I brought it out at the Dal Verme, Milan, just a year ago.&quot;

Towards the end of the prologue, singers often interpolate a high A♭ and a high G, although these do not appear in the original full score. In an Australian newspaper article in December 1893, the baritone Guigliemo Caruson, who had already sung the part in Genoa earlier that year said that &quot;whilst rehearsing under Signor Leoncavallo&#x27;s immediate direction, the composer gave his consent to the interpolation remarking that it was very effective, but that he would not add it to the score as he did not wish to force the note upon voices it did not suit.&quot;

==Performance history==
&quot;Pagliacci&quot; received mixed critical reviews after its world premiere, but was instantly successful with the public and has remained so ever since. 

The UK premiere of &quot;Pagliacci&quot; took place at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, under the management of Sir Augustus Harris in London on 19 May 1893, supervised by the composer. Nellie Melba sang Nedda, with Fernando de Lucia as Canio and Mario Ancona as Tonio, M. Bonnard (Beppe) and Richard Green (Silvio). The conductor was Luigi Mancinelli.

The US premiere followed a month later at the Grand Opera House in New York on 15 June 1893, conducted by Gustav Hinrichs, with Selma Kronold (Nedda), American tenor Agostino Montegriffo (Canio), and Giuseppe Campanari (Tonio). 

The &#x27;old&#x27; Metropolitan Opera House first staged the work on 11 December as a double-bill with &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;, with the same cast as the London premiere with Melba in the role of Nedda, De Lucia as Canio, and Ancona as Tonio. The Met again staged &quot;Pagliacci&quot; as a double-bill with the same cast and conductor, this time followed by &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; on 22 December 1893 with Emma Calvé as Santuzza, conducted by Enrico Bevignani. The two operas have since been frequently performed in this double-bill, a pairing referred to in the operatic world colloquially as &quot;Cav and Pag&quot;. 

The Belgian premiere (in a French translation) took place on 14 February 1895 (St. Valentine&#x27;s day) at the Theatre de la Monnaie, Brussels, with Cecile Simonnet as Nedda, conducted by Philippe Flon.

&quot;Pagliacci&quot; was produced alone in Washington National Opera&#x27;s November 1997 production by Franco Zeffirelli. The re-organised New York City Opera presented &quot;Pagliacci&quot; in 2016 on a double bill with Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Aleko&quot;.

==Synopsis==
:Place: Calabria, near Montalto, on the Feast of the Assumption
:Time: between 1865 and 1870

===Prologue===
During the orchestral introduction, Tonio, dressed as his commedia dell&#x27;arte character Taddeo, pokes his head through the curtain, advances, and addresses the audience. (&quot;Si può?... Si può?... Signore! Signori! ... Un nido di memorie&quot;). He reminds the audience that actors have feelings too, and that the show is about real people. Tonio returns behind the curtain, which then rises for the main action.

===Act 1===
At three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, the commedia troupe enters the village to the cheering of the villagers. Canio describes the night&#x27;s performance: the troubles of Pagliaccio. He says the play will begin at , an agricultural method of time-keeping that means the play will begin an hour before sunset. As Nedda steps down from the cart, Tonio offers his hand, but Canio pushes him aside and helps her down himself.

The villagers suggest drinking at the tavern. Canio and Beppe accept, but Tonio stays behind. The villagers tease Canio that Tonio is planning an affair with Nedda. Canio warns everyone that while he may act the foolish husband in the play, in real life he will not tolerate other men making advances to Nedda. Shocked, a villager asks if Canio really suspects her. He says no, and sweetly kisses her on the forehead. As the church bells ring vespers, he and Beppe leave for the tavern, leaving Nedda alone.

Nedda is frightened by Canio&#x27;s vehemence (&quot;Qual fiamma avea nel guardo&quot;), but the birdsong comforts her (&quot;Stridono lassù&quot;). Tonio returns and confesses his love for her, but she laughs. Enraged, Tonio grabs Nedda, but she takes a whip, strikes him and drives him off. Silvio, who is Nedda&#x27;s lover, comes from the tavern, where he has left Canio and Beppe drinking. He asks Nedda to elope with him after the performance and, though she is afraid, she agrees. Tonio, who has been eavesdropping, leaves to inform Canio so that he might catch Silvio and Nedda together. Canio and Tonio return and, as Silvio escapes, Nedda calls after him, &quot;I will always be yours!&quot;

Canio chases Silvio, but does not catch him and does not see his face. He demands that Nedda tell him the name of her lover, but she refuses. He threatens her with a knife, but Beppe disarms him. Beppe insists that they prepare for the performance. Tonio tells Canio that her lover will give himself away at the play. A heartbroken Canio is left alone to put on his costume and prepare to laugh (&quot;Vesti la giubba&quot; – &quot;Put on the costume&quot;).

===Act 2===
As the crowd arrives, Nedda, costumed as Colombina, collects their money. She whispers a warning to Silvio, and the crowd cheers as the play begins.

Colombina&#x27;s husband Pagliaccio has gone away until morning, and Taddeo is at the market. Alone, she anxiously awaits her lover Arlecchino, who comes to serenade her (&quot;&quot;) from beneath her window. Taddeo returns and confesses his love, but she mocks him. She lets Arlecchino in through the window. He boxes Taddeo&#x27;s ears and kicks him out of the room, and the audience laughs.

Arlecchino and Colombina dine, and he gives her a sleeping potion to use later, &quot;so that when Pagliaccio returns, she can drug him and elope with Arlecchino.&quot; Taddeo then bursts in, warning them that Pagliaccio is suspicious of his wife and is about to return. As Arlecchino escapes through the window, Colombina tells him, &quot;I will always be yours!&quot;

As Pagliaccio enters, he hears Colombina speak this line and, now as Canio, exclaims &quot;&quot; – &quot;Name of God! Those same words!&quot; He tries to continue the play, but loses control and demands to know her lover&#x27;s name. Nedda, hoping to keep to the performance, calls Canio by his stage name &quot;Pagliaccio&quot; to remind him of the audience&#x27;s presence. He answers with his arietta: &quot;&quot; – &quot;I am not Pagliaccio!&quot; He sings that if his face is pale, it is not from the stage makeup but from the shame she has brought him. The crowd is impressed by his emotional performance and cheers him, without realizing that it is real.

Nedda, trying to continue the play, admits that she has been visited by the innocent &quot;Arlecchino&quot;. Canio, furious and forgetting the play, demands the name of her lover. Nedda swears she will never tell him, and it becomes apparent that they are not acting. Side-stage, Beppe asks Tonio to intervene, but Tonio refrains and prevents Beppe from halting the action. Silvio begins to fight his way toward the stage. Canio, grabbing a knife from the table, stabs Nedda. As she dies, she calls: &quot;Help! Silvio!&quot; Silvio attacks Canio, but Canio kills him as well. The horrified audience then hears the celebrated final line:
: &quot;!&quot; – &quot;The comedy is finished!&quot;

====Assignment of the final line====
In the original manuscript, Tonio sang the opera&#x27;s final line, &quot;&quot;, paralleling the prologue, also sung by Tonio. The appropriation of this final line by Canio dates back to 1895. John Wright has analysed the dramaturgy of the opera in the context of assignment of the final line, and concluded that the original assignment of the final line to Tonio is the most consistent and appropriate assignment. Wright says that Tonio shows more deliberate control in his manipulation of the other characters in order to obtain his revenge upon Nedda, after she has rejected him, and is more aware of the demarcation between life and art. By contrast, Canio is unaware of the behind-the-scenes manipulations and surrenders control of his perception of the difference between life and art as the opera proceeds.

In the present day, the assignment of the final line to Canio has continued to be standard. Several exceptions, where Tonio delivers the final line, include:
* The December 1959 production at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, directed by Franco Zeffirelli
* A 1968 RAI-TV production directed by Herbert von Karajan
* The HMV recording conducted by Riccardo Muti (EMI CMS7 63650-2)
* The Philips recording conducted by Muti (Philips 0289 434 1312), in conjunction with live performances in Philadelphia in February 1992
* The 1998 English-language recording on Chandos (CHAN 3003)
* The 2007 Teatro Real production directed by Giancarlo del Monaco, in which Tonio&#x27;s prologue is inserted into the double-bill before the overture to &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, the finale of which segues directly into the first act of &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (Opus Arte OA0983D)
* The 2008 Seattle Opera production
* The 2010 Opera Grand Rapids production
* The 2014 San Diego Opera production
*The 2015 Metropolitan Opera production
*The 2019 Maggio Musicale Fiorentino production.
*The 2024 Opera Holland Park production

==Orchestration==
The orchestra consists of 2 flutes, 1 piccolo, 2 oboes, 1 cor anglais, 2 clarinets, 1 bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 tuba, 2 harps, timpani, tubular bells, percussion (triangle, cymbals, bass drum, glockenspiel, and tam-tam) and strings. Additionally, there is an onstage violin, oboe, trumpet, and bass drum.

==Recordings and other media==

In 1907, &quot;Pagliacci&quot; was the first opera to be recorded in its entirety, with the Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli as Canio and under Leoncavallo&#x27;s personal supervision. In 1931, it became the first complete opera to be filmed with sound, in a now-obscure version starring the tenor Fernando Bertini as Canio, in his only film, with the San Carlo Opera Company. Franco Zeffirelli directed his 1981 La Scala production with Plácido Domingo and Teresa Stratas for a 1982 television airing, which has since been released on DVD. The movie&#x27;s soundtrack received a Grammy nomination for Best Opera Recording. &quot;Pagliacci&quot; was also recorded in English in 1997, and released commercially in 1998, for the Chandos &quot;Opera in English&quot; label with Dennis O&#x27;Neill as Canio, Alan Opie as Tonio, and Rosa Mannion as Nedda.

In 1991, Kent State University student Michael Mould began translating &quot;Pagliacci&quot; into English for a comics adaptation, but died on USAir Flight 405 before he could complete it. Marc Andreyko finished Mould&#x27;s translation as &quot;The Clowns&quot;, a one-shot written by P. Craig Russell and illustrated by Galen Showman. Published in 1998 by Dark Horse Comics, &quot;The Clowns&quot; is dedicated in memory of Mould.

==References in popular culture==
* In the Agatha Christie short story &quot;Swan Song&quot;, a tale of revenge referencing Tosca, the final line is &quot;la commedia e finita!&quot;
* In the 1936 film The Great Ziegfeld, a section of &quot;Vesti la giubba&quot; is featured during the famously large-scale &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&quot; sequence. A closeup of Canio marks the only cut in the entire scene.
* In &quot;Batman&quot; comic books and media adaptations, the Joker, an insane supervillain who resembles a clown with homicidal tendencies, often makes references to this opera. For instance, the character makes a reference to the lyrics in the story, &quot;The Case of the Joker&#x27;s Crime Circus&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #4. In addition, the opera is featured in the &quot;Batman&quot; television series episode, &quot;The Joker is Wild&quot; where the Joker is disguised as the lead character of the opera, singing &quot;Vesti la giubba&quot;.
* The song &quot;(I&#x27;m Afraid) The Masquerade Is Over&quot;, written by Allie Wrubel and Herb Magidson and popularized in 1939 by both the Larry Clinton and Jimmy Dorsey orchestras, references Pagliacci in the lines, &quot;I guess I&#x27;ll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown&#x27;s disguise/And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes.&quot; The song was most notably covered by Marvin Gaye in 1961 for Motown Records.
* The song &quot;Mr. Sandman&quot;, written by Pat Ballard and popularized in 1954 by The Chordettes, references Pagliacci in the lines, &quot;Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci, And lots of wavy hair like Liberace.&quot;
* The 1970 Smokey Robinson and the Miracles hit &quot;The Tears of a Clown&quot; references Pagliacci in the lines &quot;Just like Pagliacci did, I try to keep my sadness hid&quot;. An earlier song cowritten by Robinson, &quot;My Smile Is Just a Frown Turned Upside,&quot; sung by Carolyn Crawford in 1964, had included the same line.
* In the 49th episode of the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;The Opera&quot;, the characters attend a production of Pagliacci.
* In &quot;Shock Corridor&quot;, one of the patients is named after the opera. This patient has a caricature of Canio above his bed.
* In &quot;Cabrini&quot;, the famous solo &quot;Vesti La Giubba&quot; is sung by Rolando Villazón playing Enrico DiSalvo.
* The protagonist of &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, Canio, also appears as a legendary joker card in the Poker-themed video game Balatro.
* The opera is performed in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Italian Bob&quot; (2005) in which Sideshow Bob sings the final verse of Vesti la giubba.

<doc id="377825" wikidata="Q548161" url="?curid=377825" title="Simon Boccanegra">
<text>Simon Boccanegra () is an opera with a prologue and three acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Francesco Maria Piave, based on the play &quot;Simón Bocanegra&quot; (1843) by Antonio García Gutiérrez, whose play &quot;El trovador&quot; had been the basis for Verdi&#x27;s 1853 opera, &quot;Il trovatore&quot;.

&quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; was first performed at Teatro La Fenice in Venice on 12 March 1857. Given the complications of the original plot and the generally poor popular response – although the critical one was more encouraging – the opera dropped out of favour after 1866. Finally, 23 years later, Verdi&#x27;s publisher persuaded the composer to revise the opera, with text changes to be prepared by Arrigo Boito, the librettist who aspired to work with the aging composer on a project which eventually became a new opera, &quot;Otello&quot;, but to which Verdi had not totally committed at that time.

The revised version of &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, with the now-famous Council Chamber scene, was first performed at La Scala in Milan on 24 March 1881. It is this version which is the one most frequently performed today.

==Composition history: the 1857 version==

Musicologist and author Julian Budden points to three projects which the composer had in mind when, at the beginning of 1855, he turned down an invitation from La Fenice to write a new opera for them for the following year. He responded: &quot;the chief obstacle is my unshakable determination not to bind myself anymore to a definite period for either the composition or the production&quot;. While that approach did not turn out to be practicable at that time, it was an ultimate goal and, in aiming to achieve it, his partner of the previous four years, Giuseppina Strepponi greatly encouraged it when she wrote to him at the time of his frustrations two years earlier when working in Paris on &quot;Les vêpres siciliennes&quot;.

The only project for which there was forward motion was towards accomplishing his long-planned &quot;Re Lear&quot;, an opera to be based on &quot;King Lear&quot;, for which his new librettist (following Salvadore Cammarano&#x27;s death) was Antonio Somma. But a year later, when overseeing a revival of &quot;La traviata&quot; at La Fenice, he agreed to a new opera for that house for the 1856/7 season, and he proposed the Gutiérrez play, which Budden presumes he had read in translation. Budden also presumes that the translation had been done by Strepponi, because she had been the translator of Gutiérrez&#x27; other play which had become &quot;Il trovatore&quot;.

The somewhat convoluted plot of &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; can be hard to follow. Budden notes: &quot;All the characters define themselves against an ingeniously shifting pattern of intrigue such as can be highly effective in a play but well-nigh impossible to follow in an opera&quot;. Verdi had gone so far as to actually write out the scenario in prose, which he then submitted to Piave in August; all that he expected from his librettist was that it would be turned into poetry, so Verdi balked somewhat when the censors demanded a complete poetic version: &quot;what does it matter for the moment it&#x27;s in prose or verse?&quot; He pushed harder, stating that &quot;I plan to compose music for a prose libretto! What do you think of that?&quot; In the end, there was a poetic version and all was well: it was accepted by the opera house and the censors.

Beginning in July and throughout most of the period of the preparation of the libretto, the composer and Strepponi had been in Paris taking care of securing various performance and publication rights, including working on a translated version of &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, the opera which became &quot;Le trouvère&quot;. Piave was informed that Verdi&#x27;s stay would need to be lengthened and everything would be handled between them and the Venetian authorities by mail.

However, Verdi&#x27;s dissatisfaction with some of the librettist&#x27;s work led him to find a local collaborator to help revise some of the sections. Accordingly, he called upon an Italian exile in Paris, the politician, former professor of law, poet and writer Giuseppe Montanelli, to do this. Piave learned nothing of the revisions until he received a note from Verdi: &quot;Here is the libretto, shortened and altered more or less as it must be. You can put your name to or it, just as you please&quot;. However, he also learned nothing of the anonymous collaborator either. After the premiere of &quot;Le trouvère&quot; on 12 January 1857, Verdi and Strepponi left Paris to return to Italy, then both went to Venice for the March premiere.

However, the relationship was soon restored and Piave came to Sant&#x27;Agata in April to work on some revisions, but it was the libretto which came in for the heaviest criticism: &quot;It was generally condemned as one of the most unintelligible to have reached the stage&quot; notes Kimbell and its general dark and gloomy feel was to affect its fortunes for many years.

==Composition history: the 1881 revision==

In 1868, Giulio Ricordi suggested the idea of revisions to &quot;Boccanegra&quot;; the idea was again broached ten years later, early in 1879, but was shrugged off by Verdi with a note saying that the 1857 score, which had been sent to the composer for review, would remain untouched &quot;just as you sent it to me&quot;. Persisting with further attempts to convince the composer, Ricordi had also broached the idea of a collaboration with Arrigo Boito for a new opera based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;. Musicologist Roger Parker speculates that Verdi&#x27;s final agreement to revise &quot;Boccanegra&quot; was based on a desire to &quot;test the possibility&quot; of working with Boito before possibly embarking on the larger project.

Once Verdi began to re-look at his earlier work, objections – and new ideas – began to emerge: &quot;the score is not possible as it stands&quot; and &quot;I shall have to redo all the second act [1857: act 2, which became act 1 in the 1881 revision] and give it more contrast and variety, more life&quot; are examples of his reasoning, which he laid out in a letter to Ricordi in November 1880. His principal concern was how to make changes to the 1857, act 2. &quot;I have said in general it needs something to give life and variety to the drama&#x27;s excessive gloom&quot;, he writes and he continues by recalling:
:two magnificent letters of Petrarch&#x27;s, one addressed to [the historical] Boccanegra, the other to the [then-]Doge of Venice, warning them not to start a fratricidal war, and reminding them that both were sons of the same mother, Italy, and so on. This idea of an Italian fatherland at this time was quite sublime!

In spite of the complexity of many of Boito&#x27;s proposed ideas, along with his alternative scenarios, which are expressed in a long letter to Verdi (most of which the composer regarded as excessive), the Council Chamber scene emerged as the focus of the new collaboration. Although he had confidence in the young librettist&#x27;s abilities (&quot;[The scene] written by you could not possibly be dull&quot;), Verdi did caution Boito that he appeared to be &quot;aiming at a perfection impossible here. I [Verdi] aim lower and am more optimistic than you and I don&#x27;t despair&quot;, in essence, expressing an unwillingness to re-write the opera as completely as Boito had proposed. It would have been far more work than the composer wished to be involved in at the time.

The pair spent the latter part of 1880 and into January 1881 with back-and-forth additions and revisions (the composer in Genoa, the librettist in Milan and meeting only once), all of which are heavily documented in the Verdi-Boito correspondence, the &quot;Carteggio Verdi-Boito&quot;, and significantly quoted in Budden. All this was the build-up to performances in Milan the following March, although the composer was constantly concerned about the suitability of the singers engaged there for that season, and he threatened to withdraw the opera on more than one occasion.

The result was the contrast, which Parker describes, between the original 1857 act 2 finale, &quot;set in a large square in Genoa, [as] a conventional four-movement concertante finale, a grand ceremonial scene&quot; whereas, in the 1881 revision, &quot;[Verdi] injected into the heart of the work an episode of enormous vividness and power, enriching the character of Boccanegra in such a way that his subsequent death scene gains considerably in impressiveness&quot;. And, as Budden puts it, &quot;Simone (&quot;sic&quot;) rises to spiritual greatness. For the first time, his moral authority puts forth all its strength, ... positively as in the appeal for peace ...&quot;

==Performance history==
Original 1857 version

While not a popular success, it did garner some critical acclaim, &quot;with the music being praised for its fidelity to the text, the orchestration for its elegance, the melody for its inspiration&quot; noted the &quot;Gazzetta Musicale&quot;, but Budden notes that &quot;complaints of &#x27;obscurity&#x27;, &#x27;severity&#x27;, harmonic abstruseness&#x27; are heard from even the most respectful of critics&quot;. And Verdi himself was fairly blunt in his assessment: &quot;I&#x27;ve had a fiasco in Venice almost as great as that of &quot;La traviata&quot;&quot; he reported to Clara Maffei.

Following its 1857 premiere, &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; was performed in Reggio Emilia, &quot;where it triumphed ...  ... and again in Naples in 1858 ...&quot; There was similar acclaim after the Rome presentation about the same time, but &quot;on the other hand, &quot;Boccanegra&quot; had been laughed off the stage in Florence&quot; and &quot;had been a fiasco at La Scala in 1859&quot;.

It was given in Malta in 1860, Madrid and Lisbon in 1861, and Buenos Aires and Montevideo in 1862, but, after that, it almost completely disappeared with only a sporadic performance or two, including Corfu in 1870 and Alexandria in late 1880.

A concert performance of the original version, possibly its first hearing in 100 years (and its UK premiere), took place at the Golders Green Hippodrome in London on 2 August 1975 before an invited audience &quot;masterminded&quot; by Julian Budden with Sesto Bruscantini in the title role and André Turp as Gabriele. This production was broadcast on 1 January 1976 and issued on CD. It was also performed by the Royal Opera, London in concert in June 1995 with Anthony Michaels-Moore and José Cura and staged at Covent Garden in June 1997 with Sergei Leiferkus and Plácido Domingo in the two aforementioned male roles. The Amelias in the 1995 and 1997 versions were Amanda Roocroft and Kallen Esperian respectively.

In August 1999 there was a set of performances at the Festival della Valle d&#x27;Itria in Martina Franca, which was recorded. That same year it was given by New York Grand Opera, this being its first New York performance. Sarasota Opera, in its &quot;Verdi Cycle&quot; series of all of the composer&#x27;s works, gave it its American premiere in 1992.

Revised version of 1881

It is this later version, unveiled in 1881 in Milan, and given in Vienna and Paris in 1882 and 1883, respectively, that has become part of the standard operatic repertory. The British premiere did not occur until 1948, when it was given in English at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, with Arnold Matters (Simone), James Johnston (Adorno), Joyce Gartside (Amelia) and Howell Glynne (Fiesco).

:Time: The middle of the 14th century.
:Place: In and around Genoa.
===Prologue===

====(Act 1 in the 1857 original)====
&quot;A piazza in front of the Fieschi palace&quot;

Paolo Albiani, a plebeian, tells his ally Pietro that in the forthcoming election of the Doge, his choice for the plebeian candidate is Simon Boccanegra. Boccanegra arrives and is persuaded to stand when Paolo hints that if Boccanegra becomes Doge, the aristocratic Jacopo Fiesco will surely allow him to wed his daughter Maria. When Boccanegra has gone, Paolo gossips about Boccanegra&#x27;s love affair with Maria Fiesco – Boccanegra and Maria have had a child, and the furious Fiesco has locked his daughter away in his palace. Pietro rallies a crowd of citizens to support Boccanegra. After the crowd has dispersed, Fiesco comes out of his palace, stricken with grief; Maria has just died (&quot;Il lacerato spirito&quot; – &quot;The tortured soul of a sad father&quot;). He swears vengeance on Boccanegra for destroying his family. When he meets Boccanegra he does not inform him of Maria&#x27;s death. Boccanegra offers reconciliation and Fiesco promises clemency only if Boccanegra lets him have his granddaughter. Boccanegra explains he cannot because the child, put in the care of a nurse, has vanished. He enters the palace and finds the body of his beloved just before crowds pour in, hailing him as the new Doge.

===Act 1===

====(Act 2 in the 1857 original)====

:[Twenty-five years have passed. Historically the action has moved from 1339, the year of Simon&#x27;s election in the prologue, forward to 1363, the year of the historical Simone Boccanegra&#x27;s death – for acts 1, 2 and 3.]

:[The Doge has exiled many of his political opponents and confiscated their property. Among them is Jacopo Fiesco, who has been living in the Grimaldi palace, using the name Andrea Grimaldi to avoid discovery and plotting with Boccanegra&#x27;s enemies to overthrow the Doge. The Grimaldis have adopted an orphaned child of unknown parentage after discovering her in a convent (she is in fact Boccanegra&#x27;s child, Maria – known as Amelia – named after her mother, and she is Fiesco&#x27;s granddaughter). They called her Amelia, hoping that she would be the heir to their family&#x27;s fortune, their sons having been exiled and their own baby daughter having died. Amelia is now a young woman.]

&quot;Scene 1: A garden in the Grimaldi palace, before sunrise&quot;

Amelia is awaiting her lover, Gabriele Adorno (Aria:&quot;Come in quest&#x27;ora bruna&quot; – &quot;How in the morning light / The sea and stars shine brightly&quot;). She suspects him of plotting against the Doge and when he arrives she warns him of the dangers of political conspiracy. Word arrives that the Doge is coming. Amelia, fearing that the Doge will force her to marry Paolo, now his councilor, urges Adorno to ask her guardian Andrea (in reality, Fiesco) for permission for them to marry: &quot;Sì, sì dell&#x27;ara il giubilo / contrasti il fato avverso&quot; – &quot;Yes, let the joy of marriage be set against unkind fate&quot;.

:[1857 original version: the duet ended with a cabaletta (set to the same words as the 1881 text) then &quot;a coda and a battery of chords followed by applause.&quot;]

Fiesco reveals to Adorno that Amelia is not a Grimaldi, but a foundling adopted by the family. When Adorno says that he does not care, Fiesco blesses the marriage. Boccanegra enters and tells Amelia that he has pardoned her exiled brothers. She tells him that she is in love, but not with Paolo, whom she refuses to marry. Boccanegra has no desire to force Amelia into a marriage against her will. She tells him that she was adopted and that she has one souvenir of her mother, a picture in a locket. The two compare Amelia&#x27;s picture with Boccanegra&#x27;s, and Boccanegra realizes that she is his long-lost daughter. Finally reunited, they are overcome with joy. Amelia goes into the palace. Soon after, Paolo arrives to find out if Amelia has accepted him. Boccanegra tells him that the marriage will not take place. Furious, Paolo arranges for Amelia to be kidnapped.

&quot;Scene 2: The council chamber&quot;
:[1881 revision: This entire scene was added by Verdi and Boito in place of the 1857 scene, which took place in a large square in Genoa.] 
The Doge encourages his councillors to make peace with Venice. He is interrupted by the sounds of a mob calling for blood. Paolo suspects that his kidnapping plot has failed. The Doge prevents anyone leaving the council chamber and orders the doors to be thrown open. A crowd bursts in, chasing Adorno. Adorno confesses to killing Lorenzino, a plebeian, who had kidnapped Amelia, claiming to have done so at the order of a high-ranking official. Adorno incorrectly guesses the official was Boccanegra and is about to attack him when Amelia rushes in and stops him (Aria: &quot;Nell&#x27;ora soave&quot; – &quot;At that sweet hour which invites ecstasy / I was walking alone by the sea&quot;). She describes her abduction and escape. Before she is able to identify her kidnapper, fighting breaks out once more. Boccanegra establishes order and has Adorno arrested for the night (Aria: &quot;Plebe! Patrizi! Popolo!&quot; – &quot;Plebeians! Patricians! Inheritors / Of a fierce history&quot;). He orders the crowd to make peace and they praise his mercy. Realizing that Paolo is responsible for the kidnapping, Boccanegra places him in charge of finding the culprit. He then makes everyone, including Paolo, utter a curse on the kidnapper.

===Act 2===

====(Act 3 in the 1857 original)====
&quot;The Doge&#x27;s apartments&quot;
:[1881 revised version: There are some small adjustments in this act which include expanding Paolo&#x27;s opening aria, thus giving him greater stature in the work: &quot;Me stesso ho maledetto!&quot; / &quot;I have cursed myself&quot;, the wording of which was originally: &quot;O doge ingrato ... ch&#x27;io rinunci Amelia e i suoi tesori?&quot; / &quot;O ungrateful Doge! ... Must I give up Amelia and her charms&quot;.] 

Paolo has imprisoned Fiesco. Determined to kill Boccanegra, Paolo pours a slow-acting poison into the Doge&#x27;s water, and then tries to convince Fiesco to murder Boccanegra in return for his freedom. Fiesco refuses. Paolo next suggests to Adorno that Amelia is the Doge&#x27;s mistress, hoping Adorno will murder Boccanegra in a jealous rage. Adorno is furious (Aria: &quot;Sento avvampar nell&#x27;anima&quot; – &quot;I feel a furious jealousy / Setting my soul on fire&quot;). Amelia enters the Doge&#x27;s apartments, seeming to confirm Adorno&#x27;s suspicions, and he angrily accuses her of infidelity. She claims only to love him, but cannot reveal her secret – that Boccanegra is her father – because Adorno&#x27;s family were killed by the Doge. Adorno hides as Boccanegra is heard approaching. Amelia confesses to Boccanegra that she is in love with his enemy Adorno. Boccanegra is angry, but tells his daughter that if the young nobleman changes his ways, he may pardon him. He asks Amelia to leave, and then takes a drink of the poisoned water, which Paolo has placed on the table. He falls asleep. Adorno emerges and is about to kill Boccanegra, when Amelia returns in time to stop him. Boccanegra wakes and reveals to Adorno that Amelia is his daughter. Adorno begs for Amelia&#x27;s forgiveness (Trio: &quot;Perdon, Amelia ... Indomito&quot; – &quot;Forgive me, Amelia ... A wild, / Jealous love was mine&quot;). Noises of fighting are heard – Paolo has stirred up a revolution against the Doge. Adorno promises to fight for Boccanegra, who vows that Adorno shall marry Amelia if he can crush the rebels.

===Act 3===

====(Act 4 in the 1857 original)====
:[1857 original version: Act 4 opened with a double male voice chorus, and a confused dialogue involving references to details in the original play.]

&quot;Inside the Doge&#x27;s palace&quot;

The uprising against the Doge has been put down. Paolo has been condemned to death for fighting with the rebels against the Doge. Fiesco is released from prison by the Doge&#x27;s men. On his way to the scaffold, Paolo boasts to Fiesco that he has poisoned Boccanegra. Fiesco is deeply shocked. He confronts Boccanegra, who is now dying from Paolo&#x27;s poison. Boccanegra recognizes his old enemy and tells Fiesco that Amelia is his granddaughter. Fiesco feels great remorse and tells Boccanegra about the poison. Adorno and Amelia, newly married, arrive to find the two men reconciled. Boccanegra tells Amelia that Fiesco is her grandfather and, before he dies, names Adorno his successor. The crowd mourns the death of the Doge.

==Music==

Budden makes a useful observation on the musical qualities of the original version: &quot;all the devices that we associate with the term &quot;bel canto&quot; are sparingly used&quot; and he suggests that, at mid-century, &quot;this amounted to a denial of Italy&#x27;s national birthright&quot; for an audience brought up on the conventions employed by Vincenzo Bellini or Gaetano Donizetti. In his &quot;Introduction to the 1881 Score&quot;, James Hepokoski emphasizes that Budden&#x27;s assertion appeared to be true, since the 1857 original &quot;resounded with clear echoes of [Verdi&#x27;s] earlier style&quot; and that he employed the known techniques but, at the same time, moved away from them, so that:
:the basic musical conventions of the Risorgimento (separate numbers with breaks for applause, multi-movement arias and duets with repetitive codas, cadenzas and repeated cabalettas, static &quot;concertato&quot; ensembles, and so on) were indeed present, if usually modified [so that] the musical discourse was characteristically terse, angular, and muscular.

Budden goes on to suggest the implications of this move away from the standard forms, albeit that &quot;[it] was a daring, innovative work. Without altering the letter of the contemporary Italian forms, it certainly altered their spirit ... Quite unheard of was a protagonist without a single extended lyrical solo to himself. Additionally, Budden suggests that musically &quot;the richness and subtlety of the musical language acquired over twenty-four years suffice to fill out Simon&#x27;s personality further.

The 1881 revisions then, which, in most cases, did not require changes in the libretto, were made to the music by Verdi. As David Kimbell demonstrates with a few examples, areas such as which illustrate more refined use of the orchestra include the first scene of the Prologue: &quot;the dialogue, instead of being punctuated by the customary figurations of accompanied recitative, is set against a gravely flowing orchestral theme.&quot;

<doc id="377828" wikidata="Q829080" url="?curid=377828" title="Professional association">
<text>A professional association (also called a professional body, professional organization, or professional society) is a group that usually seeks to further a particular profession, the interests of individuals and organisations engaged in that profession, and the public interest. In the United States, such an association is typically a nonprofit business league for tax purposes. In the UK, they may take a variety of legal forms.

==Roles==
The roles of professional associations have been variously defined: &quot;A group of people in a learned occupation who are entrusted with maintaining control or oversight of the legitimate practice of the occupation;&quot; also a body acting &quot;to safeguard the public interest;&quot; organizations which &quot;represent the interest of the professional practitioners,&quot; and so &quot;act to maintain their own privileged and powerful position as a controlling body.&quot; Professional associations are ill defined although often have commonality in purpose and activities. In the UK the Science Council defines a professional body as &quot;an organisation with individual members practicing a profession or occupation in which the organisation maintains an oversight of the knowledge, skills, conduct and practice of that profession or occupation&quot;. The Quality Assurance Agency distinguishes between statutory bodies and regulators that &quot;have powers mandated by Parliament to regulate a profession or group of professions and protect the use of professional titles&quot; and professional bodies that &quot;are independent membership organisations that oversee the activities of a particular profession and represent the interests of [their] members&quot; and which &quot;may offer registration or certification of unregulated occupations on a voluntary basis.&quot;

Many professional bodies are involved in accrediting degrees, defining and examining the skills and competencies necessary to practice, and granting professional certifications to indicate that a person is qualified in the subject area.

Many professional bodies also act as learned societies for the academic disciplines underlying their professions, such as the American Statistical Association.

<doc id="377835" wikidata="Q2468410" url="?curid=377835" title="Shinobi (1987 video game)">
<text>is a side-scrolling hack and slash video game produced by Sega, originally released for arcades on the Sega System 16 board in 1987. The player controls ninja Joe Musashi, to stop the Zeed terrorist organization from kidnapping students of his clan.

&quot;Shinobi&quot; was a commercial success in arcades; it topped the monthly Japanese table arcade charts in December 1987, and became a blockbuster arcade hit in the United States, where it was the highest-grossing conversion kit of 1988 and one of the top five conversion kits of 1989. It was adapted by Sega to its Master System game console, followed by conversions to the Nintendo Entertainment System, PC Engine, and home computers. It was re-released as downloadable emulated versions of the original arcade game for the Wii and Xbox 360. The arcade game joined the Nintendo Switch in January 2020 through the &quot;Sega Ages&quot; series. &quot;Shinobi&quot;″s success inspired various sequels and spin-offs of the &quot;Shinobi&quot; series.

==Gameplay==
The controls of &quot;Shinobi&quot; consist of an eight-way joystick and three action buttons for attacking, jumping, and using ninjutsu techniques called &quot;ninja magic&quot;. The player can walk, or perform a crouching walk by pressing the joystick diagonally downward. The player can jump to higher or lower floors by pressing the jump button while holding the joystick up or down. The protagonist Joe Musashi&#x27;s standard weapons are an unlimited supply of shurikens, and punches and kicks. Rescuing certain hostages in each stage will grant him an attack upgrade replacing throwing stars with a gun, and his close-range attack becomes a katana slash. Musashi&#x27;s ninjutsu techniques can only be used once per stage and will clear the screen of all enemies, or greatly damage a boss. Depending on the stage, the three ninjutsu techniques are a thunderstorm, a tornado, and a doppelganger attack.

Enemies include punks, mercenaries, ninjas, and the Mongolian swordsmen guarding each hostage. Musashi can bump into most enemies without harm and can only be killed if he gets struck by an enemy&#x27;s attack, gets hit by a projectile, or falls into a bottomless hole. Then, the stage restarts but retains any saved hostages. When the player runs out of lives, additional coins will continue the game except the final mission. The time limit is three minutes per stage and bonus points are awarded for time, with additional bonuses for refraining from ninjutsu technique (except on the fifth level) or using only melee attacks. Extra lives are awarded for achieving certain scores, completing the bonus round, or rescuing a special hostage.

A bonus round has a first-person perspective of throwing shurikens at incoming enemy ninjas, for an extra life.

== Plot ==
A ninja named Joe Musashi must stop a criminal organization called Zeed from kidnapping the children of his ninja clan. Five missions consist of three stages in the first mission and four stages each in the rest, where Musashi approaches Zeed&#x27;s headquarters and frees all the hostages in the first two or three stages with a boss at the final stage of each mission. At the start of each mission, the player is shown the objective, with a file containing a photograph of the enemy boss and a map display pinpointing the location of the next stage.

== Ports ==
===Master System===
Sega converted &quot;Shinobi&quot; to its Master System game console. It was released in Japan on June 19, 1988, and in North America and Europe. Some of the play mechanics were altered. Instead of one-hit kills, the player now has a health gauge before losing a life. Hostage rescue is now an optional task but provides upgrades to the close and long-range weapons, and restores or expands the health gauge. Rescuing certain hostages is a requirement to access the game&#x27;s bonus stages, which now occur after the regular stages instead of each boss fight. Bonus rounds provide the ninjutsu skills.

In October 1993, Atari Corporation filed a lawsuit against Sega for an alleged infringement of a patent originally created by Atari Corp. in the 1980s, and Atari sought a preliminary injunction to stop manufacturing, usage, and sales of hardware and software for the Genesis and Game Gear. On September 28, 1994, both parties reached a settlement involving a cross-licensing agreement to publish up to five games each year across their systems until 2001. The Master System version is one of the first five games approved from the deal by Sega in order to be converted for the Atari Jaguar, but it was never released.

===Home computers===
In 1989, conversions of &quot;Shinobi&quot; were released for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum. All five were developed by The Sales Curve and published by Virgin Mastertronic in Europe and by Sega in North America except the Amstrad and Spectrum versions. An IBM PC version was developed by Micromosaics Inc. and released in North America by Sega.

===PC Engine===
A PC Engine version was released exclusively in Japan by Asmik on December 8, 1989. The graphics and play mechanics of the PC Engine version are similar to the arcade version&#x27;s, but the close-range attacks and power-ups are missing and there are extra lives for points instead of bonus rounds. There is no life gauge, time limit, or Mission 2.

===Nintendo Entertainment System===
The Nintendo Entertainment System version of &quot;Shinobi&quot; was released by Tengen exclusively in North America as an unlicensed release in 1989. The play mechanics are based on the Master System&#x27;s version, but without close-range weapons and grenades. All the vertical-scrolling stages (such as Mission 2-2 and Mission 3-2) were redesigned into horizontal-scrolling stages.

===Wii and Xbox 360===
The arcade version was published on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console and Xbox 360&#x27;s Live Arcade services, with slight graphical modifications due to licensing issues over one character&#x27;s resemblance to Spider-Man.

===&quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot;===
&quot;Shinobi&quot; is unlockable in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 after the first round of &quot;Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master&quot; without using a continue.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Shinobi&quot; in its December 15, 1987, issue as the most successful table arcade unit of the month. In the United States, &quot;Shinobi&quot; became a blockbuster hit. It became America&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade conversion kit of 1988, and again one of America&#x27;s top five highest-grossing conversion kits of 1989.

The arcade game received critical acclaim. Clare Edgeley of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; noted it as one of several popular &quot;martial arts simulation&quot; games at London&#x27;s Amusement Trades Exhibition International (ATEI) show in January 1988, along with Taito&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Warriors&quot; and Data East&#x27;s &quot;Vigilante&quot;; she said it plays similarly to &quot;Ninja Warriors&quot;, but that &quot;Shinobi&quot; also has elements from Namco&#x27;s run and gun video game &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; (1986), introduces bonus stages, and is more challenging overall. She praised the &quot;clean colourful graphics&quot; with large &quot;well defined&quot; sprites, and the action gameplay for being fast-paced and challenging, concluding that the game is &quot;well worth playing&quot;. Nick Kelly of &quot;Commodore User&quot; rated it 8 out of 10, also noting similarities to &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; but said &quot;Shinobi&quot; looks good, &quot;plays brilliantly&quot;, and &quot;combines several kinds of shoot&#x27;em and beat&#x27;em up action in one well-thought-out, well-executed game.&quot; &quot;Sinclair User&quot; also compared it to &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; and other martial arts games, but considers &quot;Shinobi&quot; &quot;sufficiently different to be familiar without being boring.&quot; Retrospectively, &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine in 2003 called &quot;Shinobi&quot; &quot;one of the best martial arts arcade games of the 1980s&quot;.

Sega&#x27;s conversion for the Master System received critical acclaim. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; praised the &quot;well defined&quot; graphics, good sound, and &quot;excellent&quot; gameplay. &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; scored it a full 8 out of 8 stars, calling it &quot;the best game with a martial arts theme that we&#x27;ve seen on a video game system.&quot; It was awarded 4 out of 5 stars in &quot;Dragon&quot;. Classic Game Room&#x27;s retrospective review reflected that the game is a classic, though less so than the 16-bit sequel &quot;The Revenge of Shinobi&quot;.

Zach Gass of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included &quot;Shinobi&quot; and its sequels in his list of ten &quot;awesome&quot; hack-and-slash games in 2020.

==Legacy==
According to &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, &quot;&quot;Shinobi&quot; is arguably the most ‘important’ and influential ninja game, as well as kicking off the genre’s longest running franchise.&quot;

===Sequels and related games===
In 1989, Sega released a sequel called &quot;The Revenge of Shinobi&quot; (&quot;The Super Shinobi&quot; in Japan) as one of the first games for its new Mega Drive game console. An arcade sequel called &quot;Shadow Dancer&quot; was also released in 1989. &quot;Shadow Dancer&quot; retains the original gameplay, adding a canine companion.

Other sequels were released for the Game Gear, Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Saturn, the PlayStation 2, and the Nintendo 3DS. &quot;Alex Kidd in Shinobi World&quot; is a parody of &quot;Shinobi&quot; starring former Sega mascot Alex Kidd, released for the Master System in 1990.

<text>Leonard Warren (April 21, 1911 – March 4, 1960) was an American opera singer. A baritone, he was a leading artist for many years with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Especially noted for his portrayals of the leading baritone roles in the operas of Giuseppe Verdi, he had few rival baritones in his time. His power and range were the highlights of his vocal instrument.

==Biography==
Born Leonard Warenoff in the Bronx to Russian Jewish immigrant parents, Warren was first employed in his father&#x27;s fur business. In 1935, he joined the chorus at Radio City Music Hall. In 1938, he entered the Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air. The Met sent him to Italy that summer with a stipend to study.

Returning to the United States, Warren made his concert debut at the Metropolitan Opera in excerpts from &quot;La traviata&quot; and &quot;Pagliacci&quot; during a concert in New York City in November 1938. His operatic debut took place there in January 1939, when he sang Paolo in &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;. A recording contract with RCA Victor soon followed.

Warren later sang in San Francisco, Chicago, Mexico City and Buenos Aires, and he appeared at La Scala in Milan in 1953. In 1958, he made a tour of the Soviet Union, but for most of his career he remained in New York City and sang at the Met. In 1950, he converted to Roman Catholicism, the faith of his wife Agatha, and became extremely devout.

Although he sang Tonio in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, Escamillo in &quot;Carmen&quot;, and Scarpia in &quot;Tosca&quot;, he was particularly acclaimed as an interpreter of the great Verdi baritone roles, above all the title role in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, which was captured in 1950 on an RCA Victor recording with soprano Erna Berger and tenor Jan Peerce, conducted by Renato Cellini. This was one of the earliest complete operatic recordings to be released on LP records. He also sang the role in a Madison Square Garden Red Cross benefit concert in 1944, in which only the final act of the opera was featured. Jan Peerce again sang the Duke, but Zinka Milanov was Gilda, and the NBC Symphony Orchestra was conducted by Arturo Toscanini. This &quot;Rigoletto&quot; excerpt was later released on records and CD by RCA Victor, and the entire concert was available years later on various unofficial CD releases. His other published complete opera recordings include &quot;La traviata&quot; with Rosanna Carteri, Cesare Valletti, and conductor Pierre Monteux; &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, and &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, each with Zinka Milanov and Jussi Björling; &quot;La forza del destino&quot; with Milanov, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Rosalind Elias and Giorgio Tozzi; a second recording of &quot;Il trovatore&quot; with his final tenor co-star, Richard Tucker, featuring a young Leontyne Price in her Met debut role of Leonora; and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, with Leonie Rysanek and Carlo Bergonzi. Private recordings exist of his Simon Boccanegra and Iago in &quot;Otello&quot;. He also was the Renato in an album of highlights from &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; made with Marian Anderson as Ulrica on the occasion of her Met debut.

In 1948, Warren sang in the first-ever live telecast from the Metropolitan Opera. Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; was broadcast complete by ABC-TV on November 29, 1948, the opening night of the season. Ramón Vinay was Otello, Licia Albanese was Desdemona, and Warren sang the role of Iago.

In 1958, Warren toured the USSR. He was one of the few American artists invited to do so and had great success at concerts in Leningrad and Kyiv. The concerts were recorded and excerpts have been released by RCA Victor on the album &quot;Leonard Warren: On Tour in Russia&quot;, available on both LP and CD.

In his book &quot;The American Opera Singer&quot; (1997, ISBN ), Peter G. Davis wrote of Warren:

The rich, rounded, mellow quality of [Warren&#x27;s] voice, fairly bursting with resonant overtones, may not have been to every taste, particularly those preferring a narrower baritonal focus that &quot;speaks&quot; more quickly on the note. But by any standards it was a deluxe, quintessentially &quot;Metropolitan Opera sound&quot;, one that seemed to take on a special glow and lustrousness as it opened up and spread itself generously around the big auditorium. And of course the easy top was its special glory—when relaxing with friends Warren would often tear into tenor arias like &quot;Di quella pira&quot; and toss off the high Cs that many tenors lacked. He could have, but never did, overindulge that applause-getting facility.

===Death===

Warren&#x27;s last complete performance was in the title role of &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot; on March 1, 1960, at the Met. Three days later, on March 4, during a performance of &quot;La forza del destino&quot; with Renata Tebaldi as Leonora and Thomas Schippers conducting, Warren suddenly collapsed and died on stage. Eyewitnesses including Rudolf Bing reported that Warren had completed Don Carlo&#x27;s Act III aria, which begins &quot;Morir, tremenda cosa&quot; (&quot;to die, a momentous thing&quot;), and was supposed to open a sealed wallet, examine the contents and cry out &quot;È salvo, o gioia&quot; (He is safe, oh joy), before launching into the vigorous cabaletta. While Bing reports that Warren simply went silent and fell face-forward to the floor, others state that he started coughing and gasping, and that he cried out &quot;Help me, help me!&quot; before falling to the floor, remaining motionless. Roald Reitan, singing the Surgeon, was on stage with Warren at the time of his death, and attempted to render aid.

Although no autopsy was performed, Warren&#x27;s death was initially thought to have been caused by a massive cerebral hemorrhage, but was later believed by the Met house physician who attended Warren after his collapse, to have been a heart attack; Warren was only forty-eight years old. His death affected the Met schedule for several years following; he had been cast in the title role for a future Met premiere of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Nabucco&quot; during the 1960–61 season. Warren is interred at Saint Mary&#x27;s Cemetery in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Ted Morgan, writing (as Sanche de Gramont) for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, won the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting, Edition Time in 1961 for .

<text>William Michael Connolley (born 12 April 1964) is a British software engineer, writer, and blogger on climatology. Until December 2007 he was Senior Scientific Officer in the Physical Sciences Division in the Antarctic Climate and the Earth System project at the British Antarctic Survey, where he worked as a climate modeller. After that he became a software engineer for Cambridge Silicon Radio.

Connolley received national press attention over several years for his involvement in editing Wikipedia articles relating to climate change. Connolley was a member of the RealClimate website until 2007 and now operates a website and blog that discuss climate issues. He has also been active in local politics as a member of the Green Party.

==Background==
Connolley holds an undergraduate degree in mathematics and a DPhil from St Edmund Hall at the University of Oxford for his work on numerical analysis. He works as a software engineer for Cambridge Silicon Radio, designing embedded firmware.

Until December 2007, Connolley was Senior Scientific Officer in the Physical Sciences Division in the Antarctic Climate and the Earth System project at the British Antarctic Survey. His research focused on sea ice measurement and modelling, including the HadCM3 global climate model (GCM). Connolley also worked on the validation of satellite data against more direct upward looking sonar observations in the Weddell Sea area. He concluded that Bootstrap data produced a better fit than data produced by NASA and that GCM predictions are more realistic than previously thought.

Connolley served as a parish councillor in the village of Coton (near Cambridge, England) until May 2007. He was also a Green Party candidate for South Cambridgeshire District Council and Cambridgeshire County Council.

==Writing and editing==
Connolley has authored and co-authored articles and literature reviews in the field of climatological research, with an emphasis on the climate of the Antarctic and the study of sea ice. Connolley was a member of the RealClimate website until 2007, and he operates a website and blog that discuss climate issues. His blogs and one of his papers conclude that a majority of scientific papers in the 1970s predicted warming, not global cooling. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; noted in 2007 that on Connolley&#x27;s &quot;personal website, and as a contributor to RealClimate.org (a website written and edited by working climate scientists), he&#x27;s authored a number of articles that try to clarify the place of global cooling in the history of science&quot; and commented, &quot;Connolley and Schneider say that if the public had looked directly at the peer-reviewed scientific papers, and not at the popular media coverage, they would not have found any basis for a global-cooling scare.&quot;

===Wikipedia editing===
Connolley began editing Wikipedia in 2003 and served as a Wikipedia administrator from 2006 until 2009. He has been cited and quoted in the media regarding these activities, especially with respect to his editing in the area of climate change. He was cited by &quot;Nature&quot; magazine, in their December 2005 review of the reliability of Wikipedia, as an example of an expert who edits Wikipedia. &quot;Nature&quot; quoted Connolley, in 2006, as saying that &quot;some scientists have become frustrated with Wikipedia&quot; but that &quot;conflict can sometimes result in better articles&quot;.

====No weight given to subject matter experts====
In July 2006, a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article described him as briefly becoming &quot;a victim of an edit war over the entry on global warming&quot;, in which a sceptic repeatedly &quot;watered down&quot; the article&#x27;s explanation of the greenhouse effect. Connolley told the magazine that Wikipedia &quot;gives no privilege to those who know what they&#x27;re talking about&quot;. Various books have cited Connolley as an example of how expert editors on Wikipedia are given &quot;no more credence&quot; than anonymous editors of the site. In 2007, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London ran an interview of author Andrew Keen that discussed Connolley and his Wikipedia editing. It identified Connolley as &quot;an expert on global warming&quot;, stating: &quot;After trying to correct inaccuracies Connolley was accused of trying to remove &#x27;any point of view which does not match his own&#x27;. Eventually he was limited to making just one edit a day.&quot; The article stated that Wikipedia&#x27;s Arbitration Committee &quot;gave no weight to [Connolley&#x27;s] expertise, and treated him with the same credibility as his anonymous opponent.&quot;

====Alleged abuse of administrative privileges====
Two internal disputes at Wikipedia in which Connolley was involved received additional attention. A 2005 Wikipedia climate change dispute involving breaches of etiquette, rather than content bias, was cited by a paper in the &quot;Journal of Science Communication&quot; as an example that &quot;resonated deeply as it highlighted what can befall respected experts who wade into controversial wiki-waters&quot;. The paper stated that Connolley did &quot;not suffer...fools gladly&quot;.

The same paper noted a 2009 Wikipedia arbitration in which it was concluded that Connolley had used administrator privileges to his own advantage in content disputes, and these privileges were removed. Other academic papers have discussed Connolley&#x27;s editing activities on Wikipedia and the dispute resolution process as it has been applied to him.

==Personal life==
Connolley has two children.

<doc id="377842" wikidata="Q304413" url="?curid=377842" title="Diyala River">
<text>The Diyala (Arabic: ; ; Farsi: , ) is a river and tributary of the Tigris. It is formed by the confluence of the Sirwan and Tanjaro rivers in Darbandikhan Dam in the Sulaymaniyah Governorate of Northern Iraq. It covers a total distance of .

==Course==
It rises near Hamadan, in the Zagros Mountains of Iran. It then descends through the mountains, where for some 32 km it forms the border between the two countries. It finally flows into the Tigris below Baghdad. Navigation of the upper reaches of the Diyala is not possible because of its narrow defiles, but the river&#x27;s valley provides an important trade route between Iran and Iraq.

The river flows southwest of the Hamrin Mountains.

==Name==
Its Aramaic origin is &quot;Diyalas&quot; and in Kurdish it is called &quot;Sirwan&quot;, meaning &#x27;roaring sea&#x27; or &#x27;shouting river&#x27;. In the early Islamic period, the lower course of the river formed part of the Nahrawan Canal. The Diyala Governorate in Iraq is named after the river.

It may be the ancient Tornas river.

==History==
===Bronze Age===
This area flourished already during the Jemdet Nasr and Early Dynastic periods, through to the Akkadian period.

In Eshnunna (Tell Asmar), the Tell Asmar Hoard is particularly notable. Twelve remarkable statues were found belonging to the Early Dynastic period (2900–2350 BC).

====Scarlet Ware====

A type of pottery known as &#x27;Scarlet Ware&#x27;, a brightly coloured pottery with pictorial representations, was typical of sites along the Diyala River. It developed around 2800 BC, and is related to the Jemdet Nasr ware in central Mesopotamia of the same period. The red colour was achieved predominantly by using haematite paint.

Scarlet Ware is typical of Early Dynastic I and II periods. Along the Diyala is located one of the most important trade routes linking south Mesopotamia with the Iranian plateau. Thus, Scarlet ware was also popular in Pusht-i Kuh, Luristan, and it was traded to Susa during Susa II period.

====Middle Bronze====
During the Larsa period, Eshnunna especially became prominent. The Diyala river also bore the name &quot;Shu-durul&quot; at the time.

===Iron Age===
In 693 BC, the Battle of Diyala River took place between the forces of the Assyrians and the Elamites of southern Iran.

The river is mentioned in Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; under the name Gyndes, where it is stated that the king Cyrus the Great dispersed it by digging 360 channels as punishment after a sacred white horse perished there. The river returned to its former proportions after the channels disappeared under the sand.

===Modern history===
In March 1917 the British Empire defeated the Ottoman Empire at the confluence with the Tigris, leading to the Fall of Baghdad, part of the Mesopotamian Campaign of World War I.

==Excavations==
Major excavations were done in the lower Diyala river basin in the 1930s. They were conducted by the University of Chicago Oriental Institute (1930–1937) and by the University of Pennsylvania (1938–1939). The sites such as Tell Agrab, Tell Asmar (ancient Eshnunna), Ishchali (ancient Neribtum), and Khafaje (ancient Tutub) were excavated.

At that time, the Diyala was relatively unexplored compared to southern and northern Mesopotamia. But looting of sites was already underway. As the result, the professional excavations were launched.

Archaeologists James Breasted and Henri Frankfort were leading these projects.

These excavations provided very comprehensive data on Mesopotamian archaeology and chronology. They covered the time between the late Uruk period and the end of the Old Babylonian period (3000–1700 BC).

Subsequently, nine detailed monographs were published, but most of the objects, numbering 12,000, remained unpublished. Launched in 1992, the Diyala Database Project has been publishing a lot of this material.

Other scholars who worked there were Thorkild Jacobsen as epigrapher, Seton Lloyd, and Pinhas Delougaz.

Around 1980, the Diyala region was also explored intensively as part of the Hamrin Dam Salvage Project. The following sites were excavated from 1977 to 1981: Tell Yelkhi, Tell Hassan, Tell Abu Husaini, Tell Kesaran, Tell Harbud, Tell al-Sarah, and Tell Mahmud.

==Dams==
In Iran the Daryan Dam is constructed near Daryan in Kermanshah province. One of the goals of the dam is to divert a portion of the water to southwestern Iran for irrigation through the long Nosoud Water Conveyance Tunnel and to produce hydroelectric power. In Iraq, the river first reaches the Darbandikhan Dam which generates hydroelectric power and stores water for irrigation. It then flows down to the Hemrin Dam for similar purposes. In the lower Diyala Valley near Baghdad the river is controlled by the Diyala Weir which controls floods and irrigates the area northeast of Baghdad.

<doc id="377844" wikidata="Q333863" url="?curid=377844" title="D. A. Thomas">
<text>David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda, PC (26 March 1856 – 3 July 1918), was a Welsh industrialist and Liberal politician. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Merthyr Tydfil from 1888 until the January 1910 general election, then MP for Cardiff until the December 1910 general election, when he left politics to concentrate on his business interests. He was made a member of the Privy Council in 1916. He later held office, notably as &quot;Food Controller&quot; in Lloyd George&#x27;s wartime coalition government.

==Early life==

The son of coal mine owner Samuel Thomas of Ysguborwen, David Thomas was a second-generation industrialist. His energy and flair for innovation swiftly led him to build a commercial empire larger than his father&#x27;s. Samuel, a man not noted for a cheerful temperament, is said to have remarked on the day of his son&#x27;s birth (during a thunderstorm), &quot;Well, I see nothing for him but the workhouse.&quot;

Although tradition cited D. A. Thomas&#x27; birthplace as being an old white-walled cottage in Aberdare, this is unlikely, given that the family home, Ysguborwen (also in Aberdare), was completed in 1855. This house was built as a suitable residence for a rising industrial entrepreneur, and sets Samuel Thomas&#x27; gloomy remark in context. Samuel Thomas was one of the pioneers of the Welsh coal business.

Samuel Thomas was a hard man, perhaps the secret of his business success, and his tastes were simple. He could never forget the hardships through which he had had to pass, and as the above quotation indicates, he was unable to shake off the fear of failure. A Welsh Baptist, he managed his household according to the &quot;Protestant work ethic&quot;. This seems to have been its own reward, for Samuel attained civic office as High Constable of Merthyr, then the roughest town in Wales.

D. A. Thomas&#x27; mother, Rachel, is described as a contrast to the sometimes miserly, always prudent Samuel. She gave young David the love that he needed, nurturing the more sensitive side that D. A. Thomas&#x27; daughter, Margaret, was to cherish.

The family home, Ysguborwen, seems to have been a fairly typical Welsh home. At first, only the Welsh language was spoken there. After all, it was the language of both of David&#x27;s parents. However, Mrs. Thomas, like many Welsh parents before and since, realising that the language of the business world was English, engaged an English nurse to get her children used to speaking English. In 1859, the family moved from Calfaria Welsh Baptist Chapel to Carmel, the English Baptist Chapel opposite. English was becoming the language of the valleys, and the language of respectability. Accordingly, the upwardly mobile Thomases were going to be Anglo-Welsh.

D. A. Thomas&#x27; upbringing was stern and Victorian, teaching him discipline, mediated through love. That discipline remained with Thomas, in business and in politics. Towards the end of Thomas&#x27; life, William Brace, the Trade Union leader commented that &quot;Rhondda has the income of a Duke and the tastes of a Peasant.&quot;

Thomas was educated at Manila Hall, Clifton, Bristol, before going up to Cambridge University Initially, Thomas was to have gone to Jesus College on a scholarship originally intended for the sons of Anglican Ministers. Since Samuel Thomas was neither an Anglican nor a minister, it would be interesting to know exactly how D. A. Thomas obtained such a scholarship. An attack of Typhoid fever, contracted in Clermont-Ferrand meant that Thomas was unable to take up the scholarship. As it was, Thomas obtained a scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics, and would have finished top of his year, if it had not been for his indifferent health. Even so, Thomas was in the University Rowing and Boxing teams. Thomas left Cambridge in 1880, on the death of his father.

==Personal life==

In an age of religion, D. A. Thomas was that rarity, a man honestly uninterested in religion. That said, Thomas does not appear to have been an atheist, but to have found the religious sectarianism that marked the life of Wales at that time distasteful. Although brought up a Baptist (and later Congregationalist), he was received into the Anglican Church upon his marriage to Sybil Margaret Haig in 1882 and was baptised at St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, near Barry. The wedding took place in a billiard-room at her parents&#x27; house. A daughter, Margaret, was born in 1883, the only issue to the couple.

Perhaps Thomas&#x27; estrangement from organised religion is due to the religious controversies of the day, or the way in which his father managed to alienate himself altogether from organised religion. After moving to Carmel English Baptist Church, Samuel Thomas appears to have become embroiled in an argument with Rev. Thomas Price, the second minister. This appears to have been over no more than personalities, for Samuel had supported the man&#x27;s predecessor, and the move to Tabernacle English Congregational church ended similarly, when the minister was replaced. Samuel Thomas took it upon himself to un-church his family and conduct worship at home. Such rancour cannot have endeared organised religion to the young David.

Grigg describes Thomas&#x27; upbringing as &#x27;Strict Congregationalist, yet D. A. Thomas was not baptised as an infant, suggesting that Samuel Thomas never abandoned his Baptist views. As a schoolboy at Bristol D. A. Thomas attended Highbury Congregational Chapel, Clifton, where his uncle, David Thomas, was minister.

Although D. A. Thomas was heavily involved in the Disestablishment controversy and was an advocate of Disestablishment, this appears to have sprung from the belief that the endowments of the church should be used for the general good He advocated the allocation of church endowments on a population basis, which alienated many of the North Wales MPs. The Rev. J. Vyrnwy Morgan, Thomas&#x27; earliest biographer writes that: &#x27;...religion was a subject concerning which he spoke less than he thought.&#x27;

Despite attacks of rheumatic fever, which plagued him for much of his life, D. A. Thomas was no shrinking violet. At college, he rowed and boxed enthusiastically, and his obituary in the &quot;South Wales Daily News&quot; spoke of him being seldom happier than &#x27;when romping with children.&#x27; In 1881, D. A. Thomas rescued a boy who fell through the ice on Hirwaun Pond, Aberdare, an act for which he received an award from the Humane Society. In this, and in his later survival of the wreck of the &quot;Lusitania&quot;, D. A. Thomas&#x27; prowess in swimming, another college sport in which he excelled, holding a medal in the long-dive, stood him in good stead.

==Early career==
Thomas joined Osborn Henry Riches in the sales department of the Cambrian Collieries, later moving to Clydach Vale to learn the management of the mines themselves. In the course of this work, which went on for more than a year, he descended the pit with the workers and remained underground until four in the afternoon.

David Alfred Thomas moved to London in 1882, where he worked in a Stockbroker&#x27;s Office in Cornhill. There he had an attack of rheumatic fever, a complaint which had plagued him since his youth. After the death of Mr. Riches, he returned to Cardiff to manage the Cambrian Collieries.

==Business interests==
Not long after inheriting his father&#x27;s business, Thomas assessed the state of the company. To expand the business, D. A. Thomas converted the company from private ownership into a limited liability company, securing the capital to expand operations. The sale of shares was not a means for the heir to become an idler, for D. A. Thomas continued to take an active part in the management for the company. In the great coal strike of 1898, D. A. Thomas refused to take the side of the coal-owners&#x27; organisation. The Cambrian Collieries continued to work through the strike, an action that made a great deal for the collieries&#x27; shareholders. In 1910, D. A. Thomas was involved in a coal strike begun at the Ely Pit in Penygraig, an action that infuriated him. He saw the strike as a betrayal, and his actions at attempting to break the strike turned into one of the most important and violent events in Rhondda history, the Tonypandy riots. From 1901 to 1906, ill-health forced Thomas to take a break from his business activities. He became director of the company that acquired &quot;The Cambrian News&quot; newspaper in 1915.

==Llanwern==
In 1887, a year before his election to Parliament, Thomas took the lease of Llanwern House, at Llanwern, just outside Newport, Monmouthshire, where he lived the life of a somewhat unconventional country squire, riding to hounds and breeding prize Hereford cattle. He bought the house in 1900 and acquired the neighbouring Pencoed estate shortly before his death, with the intention of presenting Pencoed Castle to his daughter, Margaret. Despite his fearsome reputation as an industrialist, Thomas appears to have been a genuinely well-loved landowner, the tenants of Pencoed actively lobbying him to buy the estate. This purchase left Thomas the largest landowner in Monmouthshire after Lord Tredegar.

Despite his fortune, Thomas was quite content to retain the mansion at Llanwern, a large square house on a hilltop overlooking the village of Llanwern. The house, dating to 1760, was old-fashioned in its appearance with an interior decorated in a Chinese-influenced style.

==Political career==
D. A. Thomas was elected MP for Merthyr Tydfil at a by-election in 1888, and represented the seat until he stepped down to fight the marginal seat of Cardiff in January 1910. Thomas consistently topped the poll, not even Keir Hardie was able to topple him from his perch. Although an employer, he was felt to be a fair man, and was genuinely respected by the voters of Merthyr.

He was an early supporter of the Cymru Fydd movement, but opposed its integration with the South Wales Liberal Federation, thus making an enemy of David Lloyd George, being largely responsible for that movement&#x27;s demise. As President of the South Wales Liberal Federation from 1894 to 1897, Thomas believed that the southern counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, which together contained over half the Welsh population, would suffer under the proposed scheme for a single national federation. He held similar views on the disestablishment of the Church in Wales, believing that the revenues wrested from the church should be distributed to the counties on the basis of population. With David Lloyd George, Francis Edwards and Herbert Lewis, Thomas revolted against the Rosebery Government&#x27;s perceived downgrading of Disestablishment in 1894. In 1900 he proposed a motion calling for a full inquiry into the Jameson Raid, claiming that the earlier Committee of Inquiry had access to all relevant material and that newspaper disclosures had impugned its impartiality.

D. A. Thomas was much disappointed when he was not offered Government office after the Liberal election victory of 1906. Unlike Herbert Lewis and Lloyd George, more had been expected from Thomas in 1894, and his actions in joining the revolt had not endeared him to the Liberal leadership. Thomas became increasingly disillusioned with politics, and left parliament at the December 1910 General Election, apparently a political failure. Certainly, his early promise had not been vindicated. In many ways Thomas was not suited to party politics and he was described by Stuart Rendel as &#x27;a Tory in disguise. His greatest political success came later, during the wartime coalition (see below).

==&quot;Coal King&quot;==

After D. A. Thomas&#x27; expectations of high office were disappointed following the 1906 General Election he concentrated once more on business. In 1908 the Cambrian Combine was formed, with the merger of the Glamorgan, the Naval and the Britannic Merthyr collieries with the Cambrian Collieries. This great industrial combine would later take in further collieries. As Thomas came to realise that the golden age of the Welsh coal trade would not continue. Thomas sought to organise the Welsh coal trade to prevent destructive competition.

In the pre-war years Thomas acquired tracts of coal-bearing land in North America which was not fully developed.

He was awarded the Guy Medal in 1904 from the Royal Statistical Society for &quot;The Growth and Direction of our Foreign Trade in Coal (1850–1900)&quot; written in 1903.

==First World War==
Having made a fortune as owner of the Cambrian Collieries, he would return to politics as David Lloyd George&#x27;s emissary to the United States, for which purpose he was created Baron Rhondda in 1916 and later Viscount Rhondda in 1918.

In May 1915 he was on the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; when she was torpedoed. He and his daughter, Margaret, were among the survivors. A humorous story, remembered by his daughter, was that the local (Cardiff) &quot;Evening Express&quot; newspaper displayed a poster about the sinking that read &quot;Great National Disaster. D. A. Saved&quot;. The somewhat equivocal compliment amused D. A. Thomas immensely.

Clement Edwards, MP, related the story of an aged collier who, on being informed that Thomas had been in the ship when it had gone down, declared, &quot;I will wait till tomorrow. He always comes out on top, and I promise you this: he will come to the top of the water again with a big fish in each of his hands.&quot;

In 1916, he became President of the Local Government Board. As Minister of Food Control during the latter part of the First World War, he was very successful, introducing an efficient system of rationing.

==Last years==

The work took a terrible toll on his constitution, however, and he died at Llanwern on the morning of Wednesday, 3 July 1918, aged 62. He was cremated at Golders Green, but his ashes were returned to St Mary&#x27;s Church, Llanwern, where they lie alongside the bodies of previous squires of Llanwern (although D. A. Thomas&#x27; monument is by far the largest – &quot;on a recent visit to Llanwern, it took me two circuits of the churchyard to find the tomb, since I had initially mistaken it for the War memorial&quot;, in the words of one D. A. Thomas Scholar), his wife and daughter. His epitaph reads, &#x27;He counted his life not dear to himself.&#x27;

While the Rhondda Barony died with him, the title of Viscount Rhondda passed to his daughter Margaret by special remainder, something Thomas had insisted on when he was offered the honour. Following his death, and with the recent passage of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, she attempted to take his seat in the House of Lords. After initially being accepted, the relevant committee&#x27;s membership was altered and her request was rejected.

Thomas&#x27;s widow, Sybil, Viscountess Rhondda (1857–1941) was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1920.

==Legacy==

Thomas had extensive investments in the coalfields on the Peace River, in remote northern Alberta, Canada. He commissioned what was to be the largest riverboat on the Peace River, which was named &quot;D.A. Thomas&quot; in his honour.

<text>Lechlade () is a town at the edge of the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire, England, south of Birmingham and west of London. It is the highest point at which the River Thames is navigable, although there is a right of navigation that continues south-west into Cricklade, in the neighbouring county of Wiltshire. The town is named after the River Leach that joins the Thames near the Trout Inn and St. John&#x27;s Bridge.

The low-lying land is alluvium, Oxford Clay and river gravels and the town is surrounded by lakes created from disused gravel extraction sites, forming parts of the Cotswold Water Park; several have now been designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and nature reserves. Human occupation dates from the neolithic, Iron Age and Roman periods and it developed as a trading centre served by river, canal, roads and railway, although the station closed in 1962.

The Anglican Church of St Lawrence is a Grade I listed building dating from the 15th century. The development of the nearby RAF Fairford and RAF Brize Norton after World War II contributed to the expansion of the town.

According to the University of Nottingham’s &quot;Survey of English Place-Names&quot;, “Lechlade” is usually interpreted as referring to a passage across the River Thames near its confluence with the River Leach, but is more likely to mean “a water-course of the Leach”, i.e. some alternative water-channel of the Leach, such as a mill-stream:
==History==
A neolithic cursus was discovered from cropmarks on aerial photographs was identified in 1943. There are several archaeological remains of dwellings from the Iron Age and Roman periods, which have now been scheduled as an ancient monument.

William the Conqueror gave the manor of Lechlade to Henry de Ferrers, who had accompanied him to England in 1066, and the manor is mentioned in the Domesday Book. A charter granting market to the town was passed in 1210. Lechlade Priory was founded in the early 13th century and lasted until 1472. The town developed as a trading centre linked by the river, canal, roads and railway. The town&#x27;s railway station opened in 1873 and closed in 1962. The development of RAF Fairford and RAF Brize Norton after World War II increased local employment and the need for housing.

==Governance==
Lechlade falls in the Kempsford–Lechlade electoral ward. This ward stretches from Lechlade in the east to Kempsford in the west. The total population of this ward taken from the 2011 census was 3,973.

Although in Gloucestershire, and traditionally in the hundred of Brightwells Barrow, from 1894 till 1935 the town was administered as part of Faringdon Rural District in Berkshire. From 1935 till 1974 it was part of Cirencester Rural District in Gloucestershire, and since 1974 it has been a part of Cotswold District.

The town is part of the South Cotswolds UK Parliament constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament, since its creation in July 2024, by Roz Savage, a Liberal Democrat.

==Geography==
The geology of the area consists of Alluvium, Oxford Clay and River Gravels. The land is generally fairly flat and low lying. It is surrounded by lakes created from disused gravel extraction sites, forming parts of the Cotswold Water Park and several have now been designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest and nature reserves. The Edward Richardson &amp; Phyllis Amey nature reserve consists of marsh and reedbeds which attract dragonflies and birds such as grey heron and great crested grebe. At Roundhouse Lake common visitors are Eurasian wigeon, red-crested pochard, common goldeneye, common pochard and tufted duck.

==The River Thames==

Lechlade is the highest town to which the River Thames is navigable by relatively large craft including narrowboats. It is possible to travel by river or walk the Thames Path from here to London. In the early eighteenth century goods unloaded in Bristol were transported to Gloucester, carried overland to Lechlade and sent down the Thames to London. The Halfpenny Bridge is therefore the usual start for a water based Thames meander – the term for a long-distance journey down the Thames. The Thames Path also continues upstream to the traditional source of the Thames at Thames Head. The river is actually navigable for a short distance further upstream, near the village of Inglesham, where the Thames and Severn Canal joins the River Thames. Rowing boats can reach even further upstream, to Cricklade. Lechlade is a popular resort for Thames boating. Boats of different types can be hired from here, from rowing boats to river cruisers.

The highest lock on the Thames is St John&#x27;s Lock, at Lechlade, overlooked by a statue of Old Father Thames. There is a view from St John&#x27;s Bridge across the lock and the meadows to the spire of St Lawrence&#x27;s parish church. The River Leach flows into the Thames at St John&#x27;s Bridge. The poet Percy Bysshe Shelley composed &quot;A Summer Evening Churchyard&quot; here which includes the lines
Clothing in hues of heaven thy dim and distant spire&lt;br&gt;
Around whose lessening and invisible height&lt;br&gt;
Gather among the stars the clouds of night

==Economy==

The town is a popular venue for tourism and river-based activities.

There are several pubs, some antique shops, a convenience store, food outlets, a garden centre and a Christmas shop.

==Culture and community==
Lechlade has hosted a music festival since 2011. In 2015 the festival&#x27;s headline act was Status Quo. The festival was cancelled in 2023 due to poor weather causing the ground to be too soft, which resulted in the Lechlade Festival company going into liquidation. 

Lechlade has a number of youth activities, most of them centred on the Memorial Hall and the adjacent Lechlade Pavilion Hall. Behind the Town Hall are large playing fields, an astro turf pitch, a skate park and a playground. The memorial hall was rebuilt after a fire in 2016.

1970 Squadron Air Training Corps was founded in the town in 1997. The squadron&#x27;s membership consisted of young people from Lechlade and neighbouring towns such as Fairford and Faringdon. The unit has disbanded and all cadets transferred, many attending the group in Highworth. The 1st Lechlade Scout Group can trace its origins back to 1915 when Robert Baden-Powell inspected Scouts from Lechlade and the surrounding area.

==Landmarks==

Lechlade Manor, north east of the town centre, was built in a Jacobean style in 1872. During World War II it became the Catholic Convent of St Clotilde.

==Transport==

The main roads through the town are busy, as the town is at the crossroads of the A417 and A361. Where the A361 enters the town from the south it crosses the River Thames on Halfpenny Bridge. Another tributary of the Thames, the River Coln, joins the Thames at the Inglesham Round House.

The town&#x27;s railway station opened in 1873 and closed in 1962.

==Religious sites==

The Church of England parish church of St Lawrence is a Grade I listed building. It replaced an earlier structure in the 15th century (probably around 1470–1476), though the nave roof and clerestory, the north porch, and the tower and spire may have been added in the early 16th century. A west gallery for singers was installed in 1740 and there were further internal additions in the 1880s. The church contains a Monumental brass of John Twynyho (died 1485), set into his ledger stone on floor of north aisle. He, and his wife Agnes, acquired the manor of &quot;Hallecourte&quot; in Lechlade. This may have been the same property as &quot;Butler&#x27;s Court&quot;, a 4-yardland estate which in 1304 had been granted by John de Bellew to John Butler. John Twynyho of Cirencester was lord of Butler&#x27;s Court in 1479.

There is a Baptist Church on Sherborne Street which was built in 1817.

==Notable people==
*Reginald Arkell (1881–1959) was born in Lechlade. He went on to train as a journalist and then became a script writer and comic novelist who wrote many musical plays for the London theatre.
*Thomas Prence (1599–1673), emigrated to America in 1621 and was a co-founder of Eastham, Massachusetts, a political leader in both the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay Colonies, and governor of Plymouth, Massachusetts (1634, 1638, and 1657–1673).

<doc id="377851" wikidata="Q287313" url="?curid=377851" title="Bauhinia">
<text>Bauhinia () is a large genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Cercidoideae and tribe Bauhinieae, in the large flowering plant family Fabaceae, with a pantropical distribution. The genus was named after the Bauhin brothers Gaspard and Johann, Swiss-French botanists.

Many species are widely planted in the tropics as orchid trees, particularly in India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Nepal and southeastern China. Other common names include mountain ebony and kachnar. Before the family was reorganised, a number of genera including the lianas of genus &quot;Phanera&quot; were placed here (see related genera).
In the United States, the trees grow in Hawaii, coastal California, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. There are native species, like &quot;Bauhinia lunarioides&quot; native to Texas and widely planted in the Southwest as a landscape plant.

Parts of some species of bauhinia like &quot;B. purpurea&quot; and &quot;B. malabarica&quot; are used in Filipino cuisine (known collectively as &quot;alinbánban&quot; or &quot;alinbángbang&quot;, &quot;butterfly&quot;).

&quot;Bauhinia&quot; × &quot;blakeana&quot; is the floral emblem of Hong Kong—a stylized orchid tree flower appears on the flag of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Airlines (formerly CR Airways) uses &#x27;Bauhinia&#x27; as its radio callsign in air traffic communication.

==Evolution==

The oldest known species is &quot;B. tibetensis&quot;, known from fossil leaves from the Late Paleocene of the Tibetan Plateau, where it inhabited the Kohistan-Ladakh Arc, an island arc that existed in the region at the time. It has been suggested that the Asian clade of &quot;Bauhinia&quot; originated as early as the Early Paleocene, when it dispersed from the genus&#x27;s region of origin in Africa.

==Description==
&quot;Bauhinia&quot; trees typically reach a height of 6–12 m and their branches spread 3–6 m outwards. The lobed leaves usually are 10–15 cm across.

The five-petaled flowers are 7.5–12.5 cm diameter, generally in shades of red, pink, purple, orange, or yellow, and are often fragrant. The tree begins flowering in late winter and often continues to flower into early summer. Depending on the species, &quot;Bauhinia&quot; flowers are usually in magenta, mauve, pink or white hues with crimson highlights.

==Cultivation==
Propagation of &quot;Bauhinia&quot; species is from seeds or cuttings. They thrive in alkaline soils and do not tolerate salty conditions. Full sun exposure is preferred but they can be grown under partial sun. Generous watering is needed during summer; moderate moisture required in winter.

<text>Louth () is a market town and civil parish in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. Louth serves as an important town for a large rural area of eastern Lincolnshire. Visitor attractions include St James&#x27; Church, Hubbard&#x27;s Hills, the market, many independent retailers, and Lincolnshire&#x27;s last remaining cattle market.

==Geography==

Louth is at the foot of the Lincolnshire Wolds where they meet the Lincolnshire Marsh. It developed where the ancient trackway along the Wolds, known as the Barton Street, crossed the River Lud. The town is east of a gorge carved into the Wolds that forms the Hubbard&#x27;s Hills. This area was formed from a glacial overspill channel in the last glacial period. The River Lud meanders through the gorge before entering the town.

Directly to the southeast of Louth is the village of Legbourne, to the northeast is the village of Keddington, to the northwest is the village of South Elkington, and to the southwest is the village of Hallington. The towns of Wragby, Market Rasen, Horncastle, Mablethorpe, Grimsby and Alford also are close to Louth.

The Greenwich Meridian passes through the town and is marked on Eastgate with plaques on the north and south sides of the street, just east of the junction with Northgate, although this location is known to be incorrect as the line actually passes through a point just west of Eastgate&#x27;s junction with Church Street. A three-mile (5 km) £6.6 million A16 Louth Bypass opened in 1991. The former route through the town is now designated as the B1520.

==History==

Three handaxes have been found on the Wolds surrounding Louth, dating from between 424,000 and 191,000 years ago, indicating inhabitation in the Paleolithic era. Bronze Age archeological finds include a &#x27;barbed and tanged&#x27; arrowhead found in the grounds of Monks&#x27; Dyke Tennyson College.

St Helen&#x27;s Spring, at the Gatherums, off Aswell Street, is dedicated to a popular medieval saint, the mother of Constantine the Great, the first Roman Emperor to become a Christian, but is thought to be a Christianised Romano-British site for veneration of the pagan water-goddess Alauna.

The Anglo-Saxon pagan burial ground northwest of Louth dates from the fifth-to-sixth centuries, and was first excavated in 1946. With an estimated 1200 urn burials, it is one of the largest Anglo-Saxon cremation cemeteries in England.

Æthelhard, a Bishop of Winchester who was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 793, was an abbot of Louth in his early life.

Louth is listed in the 1086 Domesday Book as a town of 124 households.

Louth Park Abbey was founded in 1139 by the Bishop Alexander of Lincoln as a daughter-house of the Cistercian Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire. Following its dissolution in 1536 it fell into ruin and, today, only earthworks survive, on private land, between Louth and Keddington. Some of the ruins were incorporated into The Priory (now a hotel) by Thomas Espin. Monks&#x27; Dyke, now a ditch, was originally dug to supply the abbey with water from the springs of Ashwell and St. Helen&#x27;s at Louth.

In 1643, Sir Charles Bolles, a resident of Louth, raised a &#x27;hastily-got-up soldiery&#x27; for the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Fighting took place in, and around the town and, at one point, Bolles was forced to take refuge under the Ramsgate bridge. By the battle&#x27;s end &#x27;Three strangers, being souldgeres, was slain at a skirmish at Lowth, and was buryed&#x27;. Human remains, found during archaeological visits to Louth Park Abbey during the 1800s, in &#x27;a little space surrounded by a ditch&#x27;, were believed to date from the Civil War as two cannonballs, from that era, were found with the bodies.

The Louth flood of 1920 occurred in the town on 29 May 1920, causing 23 deaths. One woman climbed a chimney to survive, another was the only survivor from a row of twelve terrace houses, which were destroyed by the flood waters. Four stone plaques exist in the town to show how high the water level reached. Other, less devastating floods occurred in July 1968 and on 25 June and 20 July in 2007.

Margaret Wintringham succeeded her dead husband at the Louth by-election in September 1921, to become the Liberals&#x27; first female MP, and Britain&#x27;s third female MP.

Between December 1969 and October 1974, Jeffrey Archer was Louth&#x27;s MP.

===St Herefrith of Louth===
St Herefrith, or Herefrid, is Louth&#x27;s &#x27;forgotten saint&#x27;, whose feast day is 27 February. He was a bishop, who died around 873, possibly killed by the Danes. An 11th-century text describes Herefrith as Bishop of Lincoln, but as the bishopric there dates to 1072, Lincoln more probably refers to Lindsey, the early name for Lincolnshire. Similar confusion exists in an inventory of Louth&#x27;s St. James Church, written in 1486 and transcribed in 1512, where he is referred to as a Bishop of Auxerre, France.

At some point, following his death, a shrine venerating him was established at Louth. Æthelwold, the Bishop of Winchester from 963 to 984, was actively seeking relics for his newly rebuilt Thorney Abbey in Cambridgeshire and sent his monks to Louth to raid Herefrith&#x27;s shrine. From an 11th-century account, Æthelwold had:
...heard of the merits of the blessed Herefrid bishop of Lincoln resting in Louth a chief town of the same church. When all those dwelling there had been put to sleep by a cunning ruse, a trusty servant took him out of the ground, wrapped him in fine line cloth, and with all his fellows rejoicing brought him to the monastery of Thorney and re-interred him.
A church dedicated to St. Herefrith, at Louth, appears in accounts from the 13th to 15th centuries, and one of his relics, an ivory comb, is recorded among the possessions of Louth&#x27;s St. James Church in 1486. Suggestions that the shrine, and later church, of St. Herefrith, were earlier incarnations of St. James have &quot;no supportive evidence&quot;, but St James&#x27; is the site of two earlier churches of which little is known, although the possession of relics of Herefrith within the parish church of St James and the continued celebration of his feast-day until the reformation period are suggestive of this possibility.

==Transport==
There are regular bus services connecting Louth with nearby Grimsby, Skegness, Mablethorpe and Lincoln. Different companies provide these, the main one being Stagecoach. However, Louth is not served by late-night services; the last bus leaves the town at 7:30pm.

The nearest active railway stations are now at Market Rasen, Grimsby Town and Skegness.

Louth is on two National Express coach routes. One is from Grimsby to Birmingham via Lincoln and Leicester, and the other is from Grimsby to London via Lincoln and Nottingham.

Louth railway station was a major intermediate station on the East Lincolnshire Railway which ran from Boston to Grimsby from 1848 and was also once served by rail motor services. The station had an extensive good yards which served the malt kilns.

Louth was the northern terminus of the Mablethorpe Loop, which ran through the nearby villages and seaside towns of Mablethorpe, Sutton-on-Sea, Grimoldby, Saltfleetby, Theddlethorpe, Mumby and Willoughby. The station was the terminus on the Louth to Bardney Line, which opened in 1876 but closed in 1951 to passengers and to freight traffic in 1960. Bardney was the connection of the branch line and the Lincolnshire Loop Line

The station closed to passengers in 1970 along with the Mablethorpe Loop Line and the section from Firsby to Louth of the East Lincolnshire Railway. The section to Grimsby remained in use for freight traffic until December 1980 when it closed and was later removed. The station building and Louth North Signal Box remain as private dwellings. All of the station site has been built on by residential and commercial outlets.

There are plans to have Louth as the southern terminus of the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway using the trackbed from Holton-Le-Clay, although the station will be north of Louth because the existing station building is occupied and the site around it built over. This would mean Louth would have a rail connection for the first time in almost 50 years.

Louth Canal was built between 1765 and 1770 to connect Louth to the sea at Tetney. It was formally abandoned in 1924.

==St James&#x27; Church==

The town was the origin of the Lincolnshire Rising, which started on 1 October 1536 in St James Church. The rising began after Rev. Thomas Kendall, the incumbent, gave an &#x27;emotive sermon&#x27;, the evening before the King&#x27;s Commissioners were due to arrive and assess the church&#x27;s wealth. Some of the townspeople, fearful that the church treasury would be seized by the men of the Crown, demanded the building&#x27;s keys. The townspeople kept vigil that night, and, the following day, rang the church bells, &#x27;an ancient call to rebellion&#x27;, to gather a crowd. Having begun marching from Louth, 50,000 supporters converged to camp at Hembleton Hill, the following evening, before they continued to Lincoln to confront the King&#x27;s Commissioners.

The town&#x27;s skyline is dominated by the spire of St James&#x27; Church. A recent survey has confirmed the height of the stonework as and to the top of the cockerel weather vane as . It also confirms it as one of the very finest medieval steeples in the country. Though shorter than both Norwich Cathedral () and Salisbury Cathedral (), it is the tallest medieval parish church spire in the United Kingdom. The building of the spire started in 1501 and was finally completed in 1515.

In 2015 two pieces of a pre-Conquest standing stone cross dating to were found in the adjoining rectory garden. The cross is of the &#x27;ring&#x27; or &#x27;wheel head&#x27; type, the central design being of Christ crucified, a form more commonly seen today in Ireland. The cross and its implications for the archaeology, history and the early church in Louth are discussed in an article in the journal &quot;Medieval Archaeology&quot;. The Louth Cross is on display within the church and a small booklet is available from the gift shop.

In 2017 funding was raised to fit a viewing door to the cell just below the spire floor that holds the original medieval treadwheel that was used to haul up the stone and mortar for the building of the spire (1501–1515). Substantial records exist in the churchwardens&#x27; accounts from 1501 onward for the construction and use of the wheel which was to become known as The Wild Mare. A small booklet about this rare survival is available from the church gift shop.

==Governance==

Louth Town Council undertakes local administration. The council met at Louth Town Hall until 2012 when it relocated to the Sessions House. It consists of 21 councillors elected from seven town wards; North Holme, Priory, St James&#x27;, St Margaret&#x27;s, St Mary&#x27;s, St Michael&#x27;s, and Trinity.

==Landmarks and places of interest==
Much of the town centre is lined with brick buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries. Louth Museum was designed by John James Cresswell in 1910. It has a Panorama Gallery, which features two back-lit replicas of William Brown&#x27;s &quot;Panorama of Louth&quot; viewed from the top of St James&#x27; spire in 1844. The two original paintings that together form the panorama hang side-by-side in the Louth Town Council building – the Sessions House – on Eastgate. The panorama gives a unique and vivid representation of the streets, businesses, homes and people of the town and the landscape as far as the North Sea to the east and northwards to the Humber Estuary and beyond.

ABM Pauls (now ) used to have a large malt kiln, which was the first of its kind built in Europe to an American design out of reinforced concrete in 1949. The site had been the location of a maltings since 1870 which was destroyed by German bombs in 1940, and had to be built on the old site to qualify for war compensation. At its height the maltings processed 50,000 tonnes of barley per year, with exports handled through the nearby port of Immingham. The maltings closed in 1998 and the tall structure was left derelict for many years. The German supermarket chain Aldi was granted permission to build a new store on the site, and it was demolished in 2014/15.

Hubbard&#x27;s Hills is one of the town&#x27;s main attractions. It was opened to the public in 1907. The park is in a glacial overspill channel that forged the course for a small river, the Lud. It meanders along the deep, flat valley bottom between steep, wooded slopes on either side.

The Louth Panorama, located in the Old Courtroom of Louth Town Council, is a 360-degree depiction of the town painted on two large canvases. It was created in 1844 by artist William Brown, who sketched the view from scaffolding erected for repairs to St James&#x27; Church spire. 

The Belmont television and radio mast, once one of the tallest structures in the European Union (until its height was reduced in 2010), is in the nearby village of Donington on Bain, west of the town.

Louth will be the eventual southern terminus of the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway, based at nearby Ludborough. The town was formerly on the East Lincolnshire Railway from Peterborough to Grimsby, an important north–south route especially for holidaymakers in the summer. It opened in 1848. The line to Mablethorpe started in the town from 1877, closing in 1960. The section to Wainfleet closed in 1961, with the Louth to Grimsby section later continuing for passengers until October 1970, with freight stopping in 1980. The former station is now residential flats; there are other reminders still standing.

Louth Town Hall, which was designed in the Palazzo style, was completed in 1854. Louth Cemetery, with its distinctive gate lodge, opened in 1855.

Alfred Lord Tennyson was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School. A stone inscription to commemorate this forms part of a wall on Schoolhouse Lane in Louth.

St James&#x27; Church has the tallest church spire in Lincolnshire and is one of the tallest spires on a church in England. It is the tallest building in Louth and can be seen for miles on a clear day.

==Shopping and local economy==
Louth is noted for the wide selection of independent retailers, with around 70% of businesses independently owned. In 2012, it was named &#x27;Britain&#x27;s Favourite market town&#x27; by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Countryfile&quot;.

The town&#x27;s long retail history is represented by a number of longstanding businesses, including the department store Eve and Ranshaw which closed down on 4 February 2023 after 240 years. Dales &amp; Sons, poulterers since 1896, and the century-old butchers, Lakings of Louth.

The first building society branch office was opened by the Peterborough Building Society (now Norwich &amp; Peterborough) in 1973 in Mercer Row. The town was also the headquarters of the former Louth, Mablethorpe and Sutton Building Society, a local society with several branches and agents in Lincolnshire, which was taken over by the Bradford &amp; Bingley in 1990.

Louth is also known for its specialist grocers, and local butchers, Meridian Meats, have won numerous awards. It is also home to The Cheese Shop, which has gained nationwide recognition, including in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and on &quot;The Hairy Bikers&#x27; Food Tour of Britain&quot;.

Louth holds market days on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. There is a farmers&#x27; market on the fourth Wednesday of each month. A cattle market is held each Thursday at the Louth Livestock Centre on Newmarket.

There is a small Morrisons, formerly a Somerfield store, which opened in 1985, and a Co-operative supermarket, which opened in 1989. The Co-op was given approval for an additional smaller store in 2013.

In 2008, a local pressure group, Keep Louth Special, was formed by residents, shoppers and business owners, to lobby against a proposal for a major supermarket on the former cattle market site. The group was criticised by a town councillor, the following year, as &#x27;outsiders&#x27; who wanted to live in a &#x27;museum town&#x27;, but a 2012 council report, while recommending a &#x27;large retail development&#x27; as ‘necessary’, acknowledged that &#x27;a majority 50 per cent&#x27; of surveyed residents opposed it.
An initial 2009 planning application by Sainsbury&#x27;s for a new store, was rejected by the council, after appeal, in 2012.
Keep Louth Special described a 2013 proposal for an Aldi store as &#x27;not bad news&#x27; because it was intended for an &#x27;eyesore&#x27; site, and as Aldi stocks &#x27;own brands and a limited fresh-food offering&#x27;, it would not be &#x27;going head-to-head&#x27; with the town market or independent retailers.

*The Leek Growers Association 
*The Radish Growers Association
*The Turfgrass Association

==Sport and leisure==
The Meridian Leisure Centre opened on 6 February 2010. By 2013 had received almost one million visits and was home to over 20 clubs. It cost £12 million and consists of an 8-lane, 25-metre swimming pool and a two-level gym with over 80 pieces of equipment, along with a sports hall and other facilities. Louth Technology Hub, which is using 3D display technology, with a focus on sports groups and clubs, opened on the centre&#x27;s upper floor in October 2013.

===Further education===
A £3 million further education college, called Wolds College, was next to the Cordeaux School. Construction by the Lindum Group started in November 2007, and the college officially opened in October 2008. Unlike many Lincolnshire secondary modern schools, both Cordeaux and Monks&#x27; Dyke have their own sixth forms; East Lindsey&#x27;s only other secondary modern with a sixth form is at Skegness. Although the town is well served for A-level provision, vocational courses were less well served until the college opened in this part of East Lindsey in September 2008, although there is the Grimsby Institute some away.
